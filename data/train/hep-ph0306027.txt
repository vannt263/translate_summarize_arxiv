    "the standard model of particle interactions has passed numerous experimental tests @xcite but despite the experimental successes it is commonly believed that it is still incomplete .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry , for example , has been the subject of intensive studies and different models have been proposed to try to accommodate it in a more general and satisfactory framework .",
    "technicolor theories @xcite and supersymmetric extensions @xcite of the standard model are two relevant examples .    in we explored the possibility that the relativistic bose - einstein phenomenon @xcite is the cause of electroweak symmetry breaking . in @xcite",
    "we introduced a new global symmetry of the higgs field and associated a chemical potential @xmath0 with the generators of such a new symmetry .",
    "a relevant property of the theory was that the chemical potential induced a , non renormalizable and hence protected against quadratic divergences , direct negative mass squared for the higgs field at the tree level destabilizing the symmetric vacuum and triggering symmetry breaking .",
    "the local gauge symmetries were broken spontaneously and the associated gauge bosons acquired a standard mass term .",
    "we also showed that while the properties of the massive gauge bosons at the tree level are identical to the ones induced by the conventional higgs mechanism , the higgs field itself has specific lorentz non covariant dispersion relations .",
    "the bose - einstein mechanism occurs , in fact , in a specific frame the effects of which are felt by the other particles in the theory via electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "some of these corrections have been explicitly computed in @xcite and the model presented in @xcite is very predictive .    in @xcite",
    "we presented a new model in which a hidden bose - einstein sector drives the electroweak symmetry breaking while yielding small corrections to the standard higgs dispersion relations . in this way the presence of a frame and hence lorentz breaking corrections are suppressed with respect to the ones shown in @xcite . in this class of models",
    "the bose - einstein mechanism operates on a complex scalar field neutral under all of the standard model interactions . on general grounds this field interacts with the ordinary higgs and we used these interactions to trigger the ordinary electroweak symmetry breaking . due to the bose - einstein nature of the new mechanism",
    "the form of the corrections is insensitive to its specific realization , hence the mechanism is distinguishable from other sources of beyond standard model physics .",
    "the two classes of models we presented in are schematically summarized in figure [ figura1 ] . in the first one",
    "the higgs field feels directly the presence of a net background charge and communicates it to the gauge bosons and fermions via higher order corrections ( left panel ) . in the second ( the hidden case )",
    "a singlet field with respect to the standard model quantum numbers directly feels the effects of a net background charge .",
    "the ordinary higgs field weakly feels the effects of a frame via the interactions with the singlet field .",
    "finally the rest of the standard model particles will be affected via higher order corrections ( right panel ) .        since the chemical potential differentiates between time and space , and we have a scalar vacuum , all of the dispersion relations are isotropic in the bose - einstein frame .",
    "theories with condensates of vectorial type have been studied in different realms of theoretical physics .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , although in a different framework , effects of a large lepton number on the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking for the electroweak theory at high temperature relevant for the early universe have been studied . in @xcite",
    "the concept of bose - einstein condensation in gravitational systems was considered .",
    "the higgs sector of the standard model possesses , when the gauge couplings are switched off , an @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the full symmetry group is mostly easily recognized when the higgs doublet field @xmath2 is represented as a two by two matrix in the following way : @xmath3   \\ , \\label{notation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the two columns of the two by two matrix are identified with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath1 group acts linearly on @xmath6 according to : @xmath7 it is easy to verify that : @xmath8 \\ , \\qquad m\\frac{\\left(1+\\tau^3\\right)}{2 } = \\left[i\\,\\tau_2h^{\\ast } \\ , \\ , 0\\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation follows from ( [ notation ] ) and the zeros represent an entire column of the two by two matrix .",
    "the @xmath9 symmetry is gauged by introducing the weak gauge bosons @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the hypercharge generator is taken to be the third generator of @xmath12 .",
    "the ordinary covariant derivative acting on the higgs , in the present notation , is : @xmath13 at this point one simply _ assumes _ that the mass squared of the higgs field is negative and this leads to the electroweak symmetry breaking and more generally to the successful standard model as we know .",
    "however , theoretically a more satisfactory explanation of the origin of the higgs mechanism is needed . in the literature",
    "many models have been proposed in order to explain the emergence of such a negative mass squared .",
    "technicolor theories , for example , assume a dynamical mechanism identical to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite explain the negative mass squared as due to the running of the masses from high scales down to the electroweak one .",
    "we now review the first model in which the higgs mechanism is driven by the bose - einstein phenomenon @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the idea we consider a higgs sector with the symmetry group @xmath14 where the @xmath9 is later on gauged and the @xmath15 is associated to the @xmath16 generator of @xmath12 while @xmath17 remains a global symmetry .",
    "now we introduce a chemical potential @xmath18 associated to @xmath17 . when the chemical potential is sufficiently large @xmath14 breaks spontaneously to @xmath19 and we have four goldstones .",
    "it is advantageous to use nonlinear realizations for the higgs field with : @xmath20 in the above equation @xmath21 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath22 . in the linearly realized case",
    "we should also include the heavy @xmath17 partners of the @xmath23 field which we have taken to be more massive than the neutral higgs particle and hence we have decoupled them .",
    "the @xmath24 field is the the goldstone boson associated to the spontaneous breaking of the global @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "the gauge interactions as well as the chemical potential are introduced via the following covariant derivative : @xmath25 electroweak breaking is now forced by the introduction of the chemical potential for the extra global symmetry .",
    "for @xmath26 we have bose - einstein condensation together with the ordinary spontaneous breaking of the internal symmetry @xmath27 with 4 null curvatures corresponding to the four broken generators . in the unitary gauge the three fields",
    "@xmath28 are absorbed into the longitudinal components of the three massive gauge boson fields while the field @xmath24 remains massless . in the unitary gauge",
    "the quadratic terms are : @xmath29 -(\\mu^2_a -{m^2})h^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the higgs field .",
    "the @xmath32 and the photon @xmath33 gauge bosons are : @xmath34 with @xmath35 while the charged massive vector bosons are @xmath36 .",
    "the bosons masses , due to the custodial symmetry , satisfy the tree level relation @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "except for the presence of an extra degree of freedom and the @xmath39 mixing term one recovers the correct electroweak symmetry breaking pattern . the third term in the lagrangian signals an explicit breaking of the lorentz symmetry in the higgs sector .",
    "such a breaking is due to the introduction of the chemical potential and hence it happens in a very specific and predictive way so that all of the features can be studied .",
    "note that in our theory lorentz breaking , at the tree level , is confined only to the higgs sector of the theory which is also the least known experimentally .",
    "the rest of the theory is affected via weak radiative corrections .",
    "as previously emphasized , in general , the introduction of the chemical potential at zero temperature does not introduce new ultraviolet divergences and hence does not spoil renormalizability . besides , diagonalizing the quadratic terms the spectrum and the propagators for @xmath31 and @xmath24 yields : @xmath40 with @xmath41 the second term in the expression for @xmath42 is the potential curvature evaluated on the ground state which in the absence of the chemical potential is the mass of @xmath31 .",
    "note that the energy gap ( energy at zero momentum ) of the higgs @xmath43 is larger than the one predicted by just assuming a change in the sign of the mass squared coefficient .",
    "some important features of the present bose - einstein condensation mechanism are : a mass @xmath43 for @xmath31 larger than the one in vacuum i.e. @xmath44 , more specifically @xmath45 , and a massless goldstone state @xmath24 .",
    "for example if the higgs mass , in vacuum , is about @xmath46  gev the bose - einstein mechanism leads to a mass larger than @xmath47  gev .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath17 symmetry requires the @xmath24 field to be massless .",
    "phenomenologically one may need to add a mass , small with respect to the chemical potential , for the @xmath24 field @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , at the tree level , the gauge bosons acquire the ordinary electroweak masses and dispersion relations while we argued that deviations with respect to the ordinary higgs mechanism , in our theory , arise when considering higher order corrections . in this section",
    "we analyze some of the effects of spontaneous symmetry breaking via a nonzero @xmath17 charge density on the non higgs sector of the electroweak theory due to such higher order effects .",
    "we first investigate the gauge boson sector and then the fermion one . on general grounds we expect the presence of the chemical potential to induce different time and spatial corrections while keeping rotational invariance intact . in fig .",
    "[ figura2 ] we schematically show how the corrections due to the bose - einstein induced higgs mechanism propagate to the rest of the standard model fields .",
    "the higgs propagator is modified in the presence of the chemical potential and assumes the form : @xmath48{hprop.ps } } & = & i\\,\\frac{p^2}{p^4 - 2(\\mu^2_a - m^2)p^2 - 4\\mu^2_ap_0 ^ 2 } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all of the loops containing this propagator are affected by the presence of the chemical potential .",
    "the landau gauge @xcite is chosen to evaluate the relevant contributions although our results are gauge independent .",
    "we are interested in computing the new physics corrections for the @xmath49 vacuum polarization due to a different higgs sector with respect to the conventional standard model one .",
    "the diagrams needed are @xcite : @xmath50{mwfulleps.eps } } \\label{wz - self - energies}\\ ] ] the major difference with respect to known possible extensions is the appearance of a new type of dispersion relations for the higgs .",
    "the @xmath24 particle does not appear in the previous diagrams since we used a polar decomposition for the @xmath6 field .    in the leading logarithmic approximation , when the external momentum vanishes and assuming an expansion in the gauge bosons masses with respect to the higgs mass and setting @xmath51 , the result is : @xmath52\\nonumber \\\\ & + & { \\cal o}\\left(\\frac{m^2_{w}}{\\mu^2_a}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the renormalization scale and @xmath54 .",
    "the photon vacuum polarization is not affected at zero momentum due to the ordinary ward identities @xcite . the first diagram on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ wz - self - energies ] ) does not contribute to the lorentz non covariance of the vacuum polarization which is entirely due to the second and third diagrams .",
    "note that the specific combination @xmath55 appearing in any logarithmic corrections is consequence of the fact that in the presence of the chemical potential the particle gaps are not the curvatures evaluated on the minimum .",
    "the contribution to the @xmath56 vacuum polarization is obtained by replacing in the previous expressions @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the onset of lorentz breaking in this sector is small especially if one chooses @xmath53 of the order of @xmath18 . in general",
    "it is possible to define a new set of oblique parameters capable to capture the relevant corrections due to this type of spontaneous symmetry breaking . here , for illustration , we consider the following straightforward extension of the parameter which measures deviations with respect to the breaking of the custodial symmetry i.e. the parameter @xmath61 @xcite : @xmath62 with @xmath63 the fine structure constant",
    ". we also used @xmath64 and @xmath65 since the photon vacuum polarization at zero momentum vanishes .",
    "this parameter is equal to @xmath66 for any lorentz preserving extension of the higgs sector .",
    "the newly defined parameter is not directly a measure of the amount of lorentz breaking but rather it estimates the amount of custodial symmetry breaking for the different spacetime components of the vacuum polarizations . here",
    "we still have @xmath67 but due to the fact that we have different dispersion relations and a different gap structure with the respect to the standard model masses the value of @xmath61 , although very small , is not zero : @xmath68 here we assumed the standard model higgs mass to be given by the expression @xmath69 which is the curvature evaluated on the minimum .",
    "the fermions constitute a very interesting sector to be explored since it can be used experimentally to test the idea presented in this paper . in order to understand the type of corrections we start with recalling that the chemical potential explicitly breaks @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "so the corrections must differentiate time from space in the fermion kinetic term according to : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the corrections induced by loop contributions and @xmath75 represents a generic standard model fermion . in the last expression we have rescaled the fermion wave function and used the fact that the @xmath73 s are small calculable corrections . in the difference @xmath76",
    "all of the lorentz covariant corrections disappear while only the lorentz breaking terms survive .    in order for the fermions to receive one",
    "loop corrections sensitive to the chemical potential they need to couple at the tree level with the higgs .",
    "this is achieved via the yukawa interactions ( for a more detailed discussion see @xcite ) : @xmath77 to determine @xmath78 at the one loop we need to compute the contributions to the fermion self energy which break lorentz invariance . in the present case",
    "the one loop diagram is @xmath79{mfheps.eps } } ,   \\label{ftext_integral}\\ ] ] where the solid line represent the fermion and the dashed one the higgs field .",
    "the diagram is evaluated in detail in @xcite and yields the following contribution to the @xmath73 and @xmath74 coefficients : @xmath80 \\ , \\\\",
    "a_0&=&\\frac{\\widetilde{y}_{f}^2}{2(4 \\pi)^2 } \\left[\\log\\left(\\frac{\\mu^2_a(2+\\sqrt{3})}{\\lambda^2}\\right)+4\\sqrt{3 } -\\frac{15}{2}\\right ] \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if only the leading logarithmic corrections are kept we have that the fermions still obey standard lorentz covariant dispersion relations .",
    "the dispersion relations are modified when considering the finite contributions . to estimate the size of possible departures from the standard dispersion relations we keep the constant terms and determine @xmath81 where the numerical evaluation has been performed for the electron .",
    "the present formula is valid practically for all of the fermions . for the muon the corrections are of the order of @xmath82 .",
    "the induced corrections for the photon due to fermion loops are further suppressed by powers of the fine structure constant @xmath63 .",
    "another class of indirect corrections to the fermion sector are the ones induced by modified gauge vector propagators discussed in the previous section . to illustrate these effects we use the low energy electroweak effective theory for the charged currents .",
    "the neutral currents will be affected in a similar way .",
    "the chemical potential leaves intact the rotational subgroups of the lorentz transformations , so the effective lagrangian modifies as follows : @xmath83 \\ , \\label{fermitheory}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is a coefficient effectively measuring the corrections due to modified dispersion relations for the gauge vectors . using the previous lagrangian the decay rate for the process",
    "@xmath85 is : @xmath86=\\frac{g^2 m_{\\mu}^5}{192\\pi^3}\\left(1 + \\frac{3}{2}\\delta\\right ) \\ , \\label{muondec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the muon mass and we neglected the electron mass .",
    "however the effects of a nonzero electron mass are as in the standard model case @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 can be estimated using the vacuum polarizations presented in the previous section yielding : @xmath88 by choosing the renormalization scale @xmath53 to be of the order of the electroweak scale @xmath89 and @xmath90  gev we determine @xmath91 .",
    "precise and independent measurements of @xmath92 and the muon decay rate may observe deviations with respect to the standard model . finally we expect sizable corrections to the fermion dispersion relations in eq .",
    "( [ fermion - dr ] ) induced by the gauge boson exchanges .",
    "these arise in the fermion vacuum polarization at the two loop level and are expected to be of the order of @xmath93 .",
    "another model was proposed in @xcite . now the standard model is extended by adding a new complex bosonic field @xmath94 which is a singlet under all of the standard model charges . in this way",
    "we also introduce an extra @xmath95 symmetry .",
    "the most general renormalizable potential involving the standard model higgs and the field @xmath94 respecting all of the symmetries at hand is : @xmath96&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left(m^2_{h}-8 \\hat{g}\\,\\left|\\phi\\right|^2\\right){\\rm tr}\\left[m^{\\dagger}m\\right ] + m^2|\\phi|^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { \\hat{\\lambda}}\\left|\\phi\\right|^4 + { \\lambda } { \\rm tr}\\left[m^{\\dagger}m\\right]^2 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 .",
    "we have assumed the potential to be minimized for a zero vacuum expectation values of the fields and the couplings to be all positive . with this choice",
    "it is clear that if @xmath94 acquires a non zero vacuum expectation value the ordinary higgs also acquires a negative mass square contribution .",
    "we introduce a non zero background charge for the field @xmath94 , which modifies the @xmath94 kinetic term as follows @xcite : @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath0 is the associated chemical potential . substituting ( [ covariant ] ) in ( [ bose ] ) we have : @xmath100 the introduction of the chemical potential has broken lorentz invariance @xmath101 to @xmath71 while providing a negative mass squared contribution to the @xmath94 boson .",
    "when @xmath102 the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath95 invariance is a necessity .",
    "once the bosonic field has acquired a vacuum expectation value and for @xmath103 the higgs field condenses as well .    in this model the bose - einstein mechanism , although indirectly , still triggers electroweak symmetry breaking while the effects of lorentz breaking induced by the presence of the chemical potential are attenuated .",
    "the latter are controlled by the new coupling constant @xmath104 as well as the ordinary higher order electroweak corrections .",
    "our model potential is similar in spirit to the one used in hybrid models of inflation @xcite .    for the parameter values",
    "@xmath105 it was shown in @xcite that the ground state of the theory has @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "assuming the new physics scale associated to @xmath108 to be within reach of lhc , i.e. , of the order of @xmath109  tev while the higgs scale is @xmath110  gev we determine : @xmath111 all the corrections will be proportional to the fourth power of @xmath112 .",
    "we adopt the unitary gauge for the higgs field and use the polar decomposition for the field @xmath94 : @xmath113 in the broken phase @xmath31 and @xmath114 are not mass eigenstates .",
    "these are related to @xmath31 and @xmath114 : @xmath115 working out the details of the diagonalization @xcite , one finds that the new neutral higgs field @xmath116 due to the mixing with @xmath114 feels feebly but directly the presence of the net background charge .",
    "the propagator for @xmath116 is : @xmath117 } \\ , \\label{propagator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath118=\\frac{m^2_{\\widetilde{\\psi}}- p^2}{\\left(m^2_{\\widetilde{\\psi}}- p^2\\right)\\,p^2 + 4p_0 ^ 2\\,\\mu^2\\,\\cos^2\\theta } \\ . \\label{propagator2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we take @xmath114 to be heavy so that the only corrections will be the ones induced by the small mixing between @xmath119 and @xmath114 .",
    "the function ( [ propagator2 ] ) for large @xmath0 is @xmath120 and resembles the pole associated to the gapless state @xmath24 .",
    "again , if phenomenologically needed we can give a small mass ( with respect to the scale @xmath0 ) to @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the rest of the standard model particles are affected by the presence of a frame via weak radiative corrections and these corrections can be computed as in @xcite .",
    "the higgs propagator here is more involved than the one in @xcite .",
    "however the relevant point is that the effects of the non standard dispersion relations in the model ii are damped with respect to the ones determined in model i @xcite due to the presence of the suppression factor @xmath121 in the @xmath116 propagator . indeed since @xmath122 the term in the propagator bearing information of the explicit breaking of lorentz invariance due to the bose - einstein mechanism is down by @xmath123 with respect to the mass term .",
    "so we have a large suppression of lorentz breaking effects induced by the presence of a frame needed for the bose - einstein mechanism to take place . clearly also the dispersion relations of the ordinary higgs",
    "are modified only slightly with respect to the standard scenario .",
    "the corrections due to the mixing with the @xmath114 field should also be taken into account although in general they will be further suppressed due to the assumed hierarchy @xmath124 .",
    "let us roughly estimate , using the results of @xcite , the size of the corrections to some observables .",
    "we first consider the modification of the low energy fermi theory due to the new sector .",
    "recall that the parameter @xmath84 controlling the corrections in the low energy theory ( [ fermitheory ] ) was found to be @xmath125 in the direct bose - einstein model .",
    "for the hidden bose - einstein sector this result , on general grounds , is further suppressed by a multiplicative factor of the order @xmath123 yielding a new @xmath84 of the order of @xmath126 for @xmath127  tev .",
    "the fermion sector also bears information of the direct or indirect nature of the underlying bose - einstein phenomenon .",
    "we demonstrated for the direct case in @xcite that the one loop corrections to the fermion velocities due to the exchange of the higgs are tiny ( @xmath128 for the electron ) .",
    "this is due to the smallness of the associated yukawa s couplings .",
    "however we have also argued that the higher order corrections due to the modified gauge boson dispersion relations may be relevant and estimated in this case a correction of the order of @xmath129 with @xmath130 the weak coupling constant . in the hidden bose - einstein case also the corrections to this sector are further suppressed by a factor of the order of @xmath123 with respect to the findings in @xcite .",
    "the bose - einstein condensation phenomenon has been proposed as possible physical mechanism underlying the spontaneous symmetry breaking of cold gauge theories .",
    "we have explicitly considered two possible realizations of this picture . in model",
    "i @xcite the higgs field was assumed to carry global and local symmetries and was identified with the bose - einstein field .",
    "the effects of a non zero background charge were , in this way , maximally felt in the higgs sector and then communicated via weak interactions to the other standard model particles . in model",
    "ii @xcite the higgs mechanism was triggered by a hidden bose - einstein sector .",
    "the relevant feature of this model is that the effects of modified dispersion relations for the standard model fields are strongly suppressed with respect to the ones in model i. we have predicted the general form of the corrections and estimated their size in both cases .",
    "the fermion sector of the standard model , for example , is affected via higher order corrections leading to the appearance of modified dispersion relations of the type @xmath131 .",
    "the deviation with respect to the speed of light for the fermions is small when considering the direct bose - einstein mechanism @xcite while it is further suppressed by a factor @xmath123 in the model presented here .",
    "we emphasize that the form of the corrections , induced by the modified propagators in eqs .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) and ( [ propagator2 ] ) , are general and dictated solely by the bose - einstein nature of our mechanism .",
    "the strength of the coupling between the standard model fields and the bose - einstein field is measured by the parameter @xmath112 which enters in some of the physical observables .",
    "experiments can be used to constrain the possible values of @xmath112 .    an interesting consequence of the direct ( i.e. model i ) bose - einstein condensation mechanism is that the mass @xmath43 for the neutral higgs @xmath31 is predicted to be larger than the one in vacuum i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "more specifically @xmath45 .",
    "if , for example , the in vacuum higgs mass is chosen to be about @xmath46  gev the bose einstein mechanism yields a mass larger than @xmath47  gev .",
    "spontaneous breaking of a gauge theory via bose - einstein condensation necessarily introduces lorentz breaking since a frame must be specified differentiating time from space .",
    "we recall that the issue of lorentz breaking has recently attracted much theoretical and experimental attention @xcite . in the bose - einstein case",
    "the underlying gravitational theory is not the cause of lorentz breaking which is instead due to having immersed the theory in a background charge .",
    "modified dispersion relations for the standard model particles have also cosmological consequences since now one can not simply assume the velocity of light as the common velocity for all of the massless elementary particles .",
    "in fact different particles will have , in general , different dispersion relations and hence speed .",
    "this is relevant , for example , when observing neutrinos from distant sources . using the present model as guide for the structure of the corrections experiments can test the bose - einstein mechanism as possible source of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
