    "since 1997 , with the first discoveries of optical counterparts and host galaxies , redshift estimates for gamma ",
    "ray bursts ( grbs ) have become available , allowing the study of the intrinsic properties of this challenging astrophysical phenomena . among these , the correlation between the photon energy ( commonly called _",
    "peak energy _ ) at which the cosmological rest frame spectrum peaks , , and the total isotropic ",
    "equivalent radiated energy , , is one of the most intriguing and discussed .",
    "this correlation was discovered by @xcite based on bepposax data and subsequently confirmed and extended to x  ray rich grbs ( xrrs ) and x  ray flashes ( xrfs ) based on hete2 data @xcite .",
    "it can be used to constrain the parameters of the various scenarios for the physics of grb prompt emission , it is a challenging test for jet and grb / xrf ( x  ray flashes ) unification models and it can provide hints on the nature of different sub ",
    "classes of grbs ( sub  energetic grbs , short grbs ) . also , the correlation has been used for building up redshift estimators and is frequently assumed as an imput or as a required output for grb population synthesis models . in this paper ,",
    "i provide an update ( up to december 2005 ) and a re  analysis of the correlation based on a sample of a total of 56 events which includes grbs with known redhsift and published spectral parameters and two very recent short grbs with firm estimates of redshift and .",
    "the analysis here reported includes also fitting the data with a model which accounts for sample variance , given that this correlation is highly significant but also shows a dispersion which can not be accounted for only by statistical fluctuations and is an important source of information .",
    "i also discuss the various explanations and implications of the existence and properties of the correlation , its possible use for the estimate of pseudo  redshifts , and the tests based on grbs with unknown redshift aimed to the evaluation of the impact of possible selection effects . for this last purpouse",
    ", i also make use of published spectral parameters and fluences of a sample of 46 hete2 grbs . + in order to introduce some basic information for the discussion reported in section 5 and to allow a comparison between the results here reported and those reported in previous works , the description and properties of the updated sample ( section 3 ) the description and results of the data analysis results ( section 4 ) the discussion of the main implications and explanations of the correlation ( section 5 ) and the discussion of pseudo  redshift estimates and tests based on grbs with unknown redshift ( section 6 ) are preceeded ( section 2 ) by a brief review of spectral and energetics properties of grbs and of previous studies of the correlation .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,^,^ \" , ]     despite the correlation is very highly significant , the @xmath4 values obtained by fitting the data with a power  law are poor , as found in previous analysis ( table 3 ) .",
    "this means that the scatter of the data around the best fit model can not be due only to statistical fluctuations , unless the systematics in the estimates of and are strongly under  estimated , as will be discussed in next section .",
    "another effect of the dispersion characterizing the correlation is that , as mentioned above , the slope and normalization of the power  law are found to change significantly depending on the sub ",
    "sample considered .",
    "this extra  poissonian dispersion of the correlation , which potentially contains precious information ( as will be discussed in section 5 ) and has to be taken into account when testing it ( as will be discussed in section 6 ) , can be quantified by introducing in the modelization a further parameter commonly called `` sample variance '' or `` slop '' .",
    "the issue of fitting data with a power ",
    "law by accounting simultaneously for x and y errors and for sample variance has been faced e.g. by @xcite and @xcite when analyzing the peak luminosity ",
    "variability correlation in grbs .",
    "the methods used in these works are based on a likelihood function derived with a bayesian approach to the problem ; however , recently @xcite and @xcite showed that the correct likelihood function is slightly different from that used by @xcite .",
    "i applied the method by @xcite and @xcite to the sample of 41 grbs considered above ; with this modelization the parameters are the index and normalization of the power  law ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and the logarithmic dispersion of ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) .",
    "the result of this analysis is reported in the last line of table 3 .",
    "the values of the index and normalization of the best ",
    "fit power ",
    "law , @xmath10.5 and @xmath1100 , respectively , lie in the ranges of values found with different samples by adopting the simple power ",
    "law fit and are coincident with those usually assumed in the literature when comparing new data with the correlation or using it as an input or required output for grbs / xrfs synthesis models ( see next section ) , basing on the early results from @xcite ( table 1 , first line ) .",
    "the best fit power ",
    "law obtained with this method is plotted in figures 2 and 3 as a continuous line .",
    "the value of the sample variance resulting from the fit is @xmath7@xmath8 = 0.15@xmath9 ( 90% c.l . )",
    "; in figures 1 and 2 i show the region , delimitated by two dotted lines , corresponding to deviations of from the best fit power ",
    "law of @xmath12.5@xmath7@xmath8 , assuming @xmath7@xmath8=0.15 ( the central value of the 90% confidence interval ) . for a comparison , as shown in figure 4 , the dispersion of the log ( ) central values around the best fit power ",
    "law obtained without accounting for sample variance ( line 7 of table 3 ) can be fitted with a gaussian with dispersion @xmath10.21 , consistently with previous analysis based on smaller samples .",
    "a similar value ( @xmath7@xmath8@xmath10.2 , is obatined when computing the scatter of the central data points around the law = 95 @xmath2 @xmath10 .",
    "this value is of course higher than sample variance , because it includes statistical fluctuations ; if one considers this as the overall dispersion of the correlation , then the two dotted lines in figures 2 and 3 delimitate the @xmath112@xmath7 region .",
    "an estimate of the sample variance characterizing the correlation was also performed by @xcite , who , based on a smaller sample and following a different method , derived a value of @xmath10.13 .",
    "+ finally , from figure 3 , it can be seen that the uncertain values and upper / lower limits of and of classical long grbs and xrfs ( reported in table 2 ) are consistent with the correlation , including grbs .",
    "figure 3 also shows clearly that the plane can be very useful in discriminating different classes of grbs .",
    "indeed , both sub  energetic grbs ( grb980425 and , possibly , grb031203 ) and short grbs ( 050709 and 051221 ) are clear outliers of the correlations , showing values too low with respect to their peak energies , which range within those of normal grbs ( figure 1 , right panel ) .    during the reviewing process of this article ,",
    "firm estimates of both @xmath0 and have become available for 4 more swift events ( grb060115 , grb060124 , grb060206 , grb060418 ) , based on spectral measurements from swift , hete2 , konus .",
    "the and of these events are all fully consistent with the correlation .",
    "the analysis presented in previous sections , based on an updated sample containing about twice events with respect to previous works and including the recent grbs , confirms and strenghtens the correlation for long grbs / xrfs and gives its best characterization up to now in terms of index and normalization of the best ",
    "fit power ",
    "law and of its dispersion .",
    "remarkably , the correlation now extends over @xmath15 orders of magnitude in , @xmath13 orders of magnitude in and over a redshift range @xmath10.15@xmath12@xmath0@xmath124.5 ( but also the highest @xmath0 event , grb050904 at @xmath0=6.29 , has and values consistent with it ) . since its discovery in 2002 @xcite and in particular its confirmation and extension to xrfs @xcite , the origin of the correlation and its implications for grb models have been investigated by several works . the impact of this robust observational evidence on prompt emission models concerns mainly the physics , the geometry ( i.e. shape and properties of jets ) , viewing angle effects and grb / xrf unification .",
    "indeed , the existence of the correlation and its properties are also often used as an ingredient or a test output for grb synthesis models , as in the case of , e.g. , the grb / xrf model by @xcite , the multi  subjets model by @xcite , the uniform jet model by @xcite , the study of the impact of off  jet relativistic kinematics by @xcite , the dissipative photosphere models by @xcite , the supercritical pile model by @xcite .",
    "another important outcome of the analysis presented in this paper is the clear evidence that , in addition to the peculiar sub  energetic grb980425 ( and possibly grb031203 ) , short grbs do not follow the correlation , as suggested by the different location between long and short batse grbs in the hardness  intensity plane .",
    "below i summarize these topics and discuss also the possible origin of the extra  poissonian dispersion of the correlation .",
    "the physics of the prompt emission of grbs is still far to be settled and a variety of scenarios , within the standard fireball picture , have been proposed , based on different emission mechanisms ( e.g. ssm internal shocks , inverse compton dominated internal shocks , ssm external shocks , photospheric emission dominated models ) and different kinds of fireball ( e.g. kinetic energy dominated or poynting flux dominated ) , see e.g. @xcite for a review . in general , both and are linked to the fireball bulk lorentz factor , @xmath13 , in a way that varies in each scenario , and the existence and properties of the correlation allow to constrain the range of values of the parameters , see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for instance , as shown , e.g. , by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for a power  law electron distribution generated in an internal shock within a fireball with bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 , it is possible to derive the relation @xmath14 @xmath13@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the grb luminosity and @xmath17 is the typical variability time scale .",
    "clearly , in order to produce the observed correlation the above formula would require that @xmath13 and @xmath17 are approximately the same for all grbs , an assumption which is difficult to justify .",
    "things get even more complicated if one takes into account that the models generally assume @xmath16 @xmath14 @xmath18 , with the value of @xmath19 varying in each scenario and is typically @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "more specific examples of the constraints put by the correlation on the parameters of ssm and ic based emission models , both in internal and external shocks , can be found , e.g.,in @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility , which is currently the subject of many theoretical works , is that a substantial contribution to prompt radiation of grbs comes from direct or comptonized thermal emission from the photosphere of the fireball @xcite .",
    "this could explain the very hard spectra observed at the beginning of several events @xcite , inconsistent with ssm models , and the smooth curvature characterizing grbs average spectra . in this scenarios ,",
    "is mainly determined by the peak temperature @xmath20 of black  body distributed photons and thus naturally linked to the luminosity or radiated energy . for instance , for comptonized emission from the photosphere",
    "one can derive the relations @xmath14 @xmath13t@xmath21 @xmath14 @xmath13@xmath22 or @xmath14 @xmath13t@xmath21 @xmath14",
    "r@xmath23@xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is a particular distance between the central engine and the emitting region ) , depending on the assumptions made @xcite . also in this case , off course , the @xmath16 @xmath14 @xmath18 relation plays a decisive role . as shown by @xcite , in this scenario",
    "the correct relation can be obtained for some specific physical conditions just below the photosphere .    finally ,",
    "also , the fact that the distribution is broader than inferred previously basing mainly on the observed values of bright batse grbs , as shown in figure 1 , can put important constraints on models for the physics of grb prompt emission @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 0.21 .,width=340 ]      the validity of the correlation from the most energetic grbs to xrfs ( see figure 2 ) confirms that these two phenomena have the same origin and is a very challenging observable for grb jet models .",
    "indeed , these models have to explain not only how and are linked to the jet opening angle , @xmath26@xmath27 , and/or to the viewing angle with respect to the jet axis , @xmath26@xmath28 , but also how can span over several orders of magnitudes . in the most simple scenario , the uniform jet model @xcite , jet opening angles are variable and the observer measures the same value of independently of @xmath26@xmath28 . in the other popular scenario ,",
    "the universal structured jet model ( e.g. rossi , lazzati & rees ) , depends on @xmath26@xmath28 . as discussed in section 2 , in the hypothesis",
    "that achromatic breaks found in the afterglow light curves of some grbs with known redshift are due to collimated emission , it was originally found @xcite that the collimation corrected radiated energy , , is of the same order ( @xmath110@xmath29 erg ) for most grbs and that @xmath14 @xmath26@xmath30 , assuming a uniform jet . in the case of structured jet models , which assume that @xmath26@xmath27 is similar for all grbs (",
    "hence this scenario is also called universal jet model ) the same observations imply that @xmath14 @xmath26@xmath31 .",
    "thus , always under the assumption of a nearly constant , the found correlation implies @xmath14 @xmath26@xmath32 and @xmath14 @xmath26@xmath33 for the uniform and structured jet models , respectively .",
    "@xcite argue that the structured universal jet model , in order to explain the validity of the correlation from xrfs to energetic grbs , predicts a number of detected xrfs several orders of magnitude higher than the observed one ( @xmath11/3 than that of grbs ) . in their view , the uniform jet model can overcome these problems by assuming a distribution of jet opening angles n(@xmath26@xmath27 ) @xmath14 @xmath26@xmath30 .",
    "this implies that the great majority of grbs have opening angles smaller than @xmath11@xmath34 and that the true rate of grbs is several orders of magnitude higher than observed and comparable to that of sn ic .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite show that the requirement that most grbs have jet opening angles less than 1 degree , needed in the uniform jet scenario in order to explain the correlation , as discussed above , implies values of the fireball kinetic energy and/or of the interstellar medium density much higher than those inferred from the afterglow decay light curves .",
    "together with other authors , e.g. @xcite , they propose a modification of the universal structured jet model , the quasi ",
    "universal gaussian structured jet . in this model ,",
    "the measured undergoes a mild variation for values of @xmath26@xmath35 inside a typical angle , which has a quasi  universal value for all grbs / xrfs , whereas it decreases very rapidly ( e.g. exponentially ) for values outside the typical angle . in this way , the universal structured jet scenario can reproduce the correlation and predict the observed ratio between the number of xrfs and that of grbs . recently",
    ", a fisher  shape has been proposed , for both the variable angle and universal angle scenarios @xcite , as a very promising alternative , in particular for the explanation of the validity of the correlation from the brightest grbs to xrfs .",
    "other jet models proposed very recently that can reproduce the correlation include the ring  shaped jet model , see @xcite , and the multi  component ( subjets ) model , see @xcite .    of particular interest",
    "are the off  axis scenarios , in which the jet is typically assumed to be uniform but , due to relativistic beaming and doppler effects , for @xmath26@xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath26@xmath27 the measured emissivity does not sharply go to zero and the event is detected by the observer with and dropping rapidly as @xmath26@xmath35 increases @xcite . in these models ,",
    "xrfs are those events seen very off  axis and the xrfs rate with respect to grbs and the correlation can be correctly predicted .",
    "as shown e.g. in @xcite for a simple model of grb jet , if the doppler shift factor is @xmath37^{-1}$ ] ( where @xmath19 is the velocity of the outflow in units of speed of light ) , and scale , with respect to their values observable at the edge of the jet , as @xmath14 @xmath38 and @xmath14 @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the spectral index of the prompt emission photon spectrum in the hard x  ray energy band . by combining these relations",
    "one can obtain the correlation with index 0.5 for classical grbs ( @xmath40@xmath1@xmath411 ) and 0.3 for xrfs ( @xmath40@xmath1@xmath412 ) . a detailed study of off  jet relativistic kinematics effects has been recently performed by @xcite for a set uniform ( i.e. top hat shaped  variable opening angle ) jet models , finding that these scenarios predict a significant population of bursts away from the correlation , unless @xmath13 @xmath36 300 for all bursts or there is a strong anti ",
    "correlation between @xmath13 and the jet solid angle .",
    "finally , the off  axis effects for very weak and soft events can be applied in a similar way as described above in the context of the cannon ball ( cb ) model for grbs in order to reproduce the correlation @xcite .",
    "in addition to its existence and slope , also the extra  poissonian dispersion of the correlation is an important source of information . as discussed in section 3 and shown in table 3 ,",
    "while the correlation is very highly significant , the scatter of the data around the best fit power  law exceed that expected by statistical fluctuations alone and produces high values of . by fitting with a gaussian the dispersion of the central values of log ( ) around the best fit model ,",
    "i obtain @xmath7@xmath8@xmath10.2 , while by fitting the whole data with the method by @xcite , which includes sample variance directly in the model , i obtain @xmath7@xmath8 = 0.15@xmath42 . a similar scatter , even if computed with only the first of the two methods reported above , is found for the  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 correlations , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the correlation shows instead a lower dispersion , of the order of @xmath7@xmath8@xmath10.1 @xcite , even if this correlation is based on a still low number of events , it requires an estimate of @xmath45 in addition to and @xmath0 , it depends on jet model and circum  burst environment properties ( density , distribution ) and there are possible outliers , as discussed e.g. by @xcite and may be indicated by the lack of break in the x  ray afterglow light curve of some grbs with known redshift .",
    "a low 3d dispersion characterizes also the correlation , which is a kind of model  independent version of the correlation @xcite .",
    "the existence of both the and correlations is due to the fact that the collimation angles of grbs are distributed over a relatively narrow range of values ; the lower dispersion of the correlation indicates that at least part of the scatter of the correlation is due to the dispersion of jet opening angles . and",
    "indeed , the comparison of the properties of the two correlations has been used , in addition to the study of the relation between jet opening angle and radiated energy , to infer the distribution of jet opening angles , as done , e.g. , by @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been found evidence that a relevant contribution to the dispersion of the correlation is due to temporal properties of the prompt emission , like the half  width of the auto ",
    "correlation function @xcite and the `` high  signal '' time scale @xcite . other contribution to the scatter of the correlation may come from viewing angle effects , e.g. @xcite , the dispersion of the parameters of the fireball and/or of the time scales ( as discussed in section 5.1 concerning synchrotron emission in internal shocks ) , the inhomogeneous structure of the jet , e.g. @xcite ) , the possible presence of significant amount of material in the circum ",
    "burst region , that would affect the estimates of both and with a global qualitative effect of steepening the correlation and increasing its dispersion @xcite . in general , several grb population synthesis models , like those mentioned at the beginning of this section , predict a scatter of the correlation which depend on the parameters values .    when investigating the above physical interpretations and implications , it is important to take into account that at least part of the dispersion of the correlation could arise from instrumental and other systematic effects in the estimates of and and their uncertainties .",
    "as discussed e.g. by @xcite , data truncation effects , i.e. the systematics introduced by the limited energy band of the detector , may affect significantly the estimate of .",
    "indeed , as discussed in section 2 , typical grb spectra are characterized by a very smooth curvature and cover @xmath13 orders of magnitude or more in photon energy . thus , unless the energy band extends from few kev to few mev , only a portion of the spectrum can be detected by a single instrument , which may cause a bias in the estimate of the spectral parameters , especially when is not far from the low or high thresholds .",
    "also , both ( @xmath12700 kev ) and hete2 ( 2400 kev ) , in addition to be capable to detect x  ray rich events and xrfs which could not be triggered by batse ( @xmath1252000 kev ) , showed that x  ray emission below @xmath130 kev of normal grbs can last up to several tens of seconds more than in the hard x  ray energy band .",
    "thus , a grb detector working at energies higher than few tens of kev , like batse , may have lost , for a fraction of grbs , a substantial portion of the soft x  ray emission , with a consequent overestimate of @xmath40 and .",
    "these effects can indeed be seen when comparing the x and hard x ",
    "rays duration and light curves of @xcite and hete2 @xcite grbs and the average spectral parameters estimated by /wfc+grbm and batse @xcite for those events revealed by both satellites .",
    "this is true , even if to a minor extent , when comparing the best fit spectral models obtained with hete2/fregate ( 7400 kev ) alone @xcite with those obtained by jointly fitting hete2/wxm ( 230 kev ) and hete2/fregate data @xcite .",
    "concerning , the main source of possible systematics is the extrapolation to the 110000 kev cosmological rest  frame energy band of the spectral model obtained by fitting data in the instrument energy band ( see section 2 ) .",
    "indeed , the ( known ) statistical uncertainties and ( unknown ) biases in the estimates of spectral parameters may affect significantly the estimate of .",
    "this is particularly true for estimates based on spectra from instruments with high energy bound at a few hundreds of kev , like hete2 or /bat , which in several cases can not provide a reliable estimate of the high energy spectral index @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the typical choice of computing in the 110000 kev rest  frame energy band may not be optimal for very soft events with values of below a few tens of kev , for which this method can likely lead to an underestimate of .",
    "off course , also the choice of the cosmological parameters for the computation of the luminosity distance , usually made by assuming values in the ranges given by the so called `` concordance cosmology '' based on type ia sne and cmb measurements , affects the values of .    finally , very recently /xrt found evidence of x  ray flares following the end of the prompt emission as detected by /bat , e.g. @xcite .",
    "one possible interpretation of these phenomena is that they are due to continued activity of the engine and/or late internal shocks @xcite and thus can be considered part of the prompt emission . given that these events are typically soft and that their fluence can be a significant fraction of that of the grb , their non  detection ( because of sensitivity ) by past and current grb detectors",
    "may also have biased the estimates of ( under  estimate ) and of ( over  estimate ) .      in the past",
    ", the correlation has been studied basing on data of long grbs , given that no redshift information was available for short grbs .",
    "nevertheless , thanks to the measurements performed by hete2 and , in the last year it has been possible to detect afterglow emission and possible optical counterparts and/or host galaxies for a few short grbs . as discussed in section 3 ,",
    "i have included in the analysis reported in this paper the two short grbs with firm estimates of @xmath0 and : grb050709 @xcite and grb051221 @xcite .",
    "as can be clearly seen in figure 3 , these events are outliers to the correlation , even when taking into account its extra  poissonian dispersion .",
    "in addition , the spectral data of other recently localized short grbs with possible redshifts , grb050509b @xcite , grb050724 @xcite and grb050813 @xcite , indicate a likely inconsistence with the correlation , even though an estimate of was not possible for these events .",
    "these evidences confirm the expectations based on the fact that short grbs tend to form a separate class with respect to long grbs in the hardness ",
    "intensity plane , i.e. they tend to be weaker and harder , and clearly shows the potentiality of the use of the plane for distinguishing different classes of grbs and understanding their nature . in particular ,",
    "given that short and long grbs partially overlap in the hardness ",
    "intensity and hardness  duration planes , that a fraction of short grbs show a softer extended emission which can last tens of seconds , e.g. @xcite , the possible relevant impact of spectral / temporal trigger selection effects , it is sometimes difficult to establish to which class a grb belongs .",
    "thus the plane may be a powerful tool under this respect , especially when combined e.g with the lack of spectral lag and spectral evolution which seems to characterize short grbs @xcite .",
    "while the commonly accepted hypothesis for the progenitors of long grbs is their association with the core collapse of massive fastly rotating stars ( so called `` hypernova '' or `` collapsar '' models ) , based on their duration ( from few seconds up to hundreds of seconds ) , their huge ( figure 1 ) , their typical location inside blue galaxies with high star formation rate and the evidence of a metal  rich circum  burst environment ( as inferred from absorption / emission features in prompt and afterglow emission spectra ) , short grbs are thought to originate from the coalescence of neutron star  neutron star or neutron star ",
    "black hole binaries ( the `` merger '' scenarios ) .",
    "it has also been proposed that a fraction of them may be giant flare from extra ",
    "galactic soft gamma repeaters , see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews .",
    "the very recent observations mentioned above , show that , as long grbs , also short grbs lie at cosmological distances ( 0.1@xmath12z@xmath121 ) but they are less energetic ( see table 1 and figures 1 and 3 ) .",
    "also , their host galaxies show different morphologies and star forming activity : for instance , short grb050724 ( as possibly short grb050509b ) came from an elliptical galaxy with low star formation , whereas short grb050709 was associated with an irregular late type star forming galaxy .",
    "both events were located towards the outskirts of their host galaxies .",
    "all these properties match the predictions of the merger scenarios ( e.g. belczynski et al .",
    "off course , these evidences concern still a very low number of short grbs and thus it is premature to draw any definitive conclusion . anyway , the different nature of the progenitors between short and long grbs can help in understanding their different behavior in the plane .",
    "@xcite found , basing on batse data , that the emission properties of short grbs are similar to those of the first @xmath112 s of long grbs .",
    "this could indicate that the central engine is the same for the two classes , but works for a longer time in long grbs .",
    "this would explain the low radiated energy by short grbs and , given that the emission would stop before the typical hard to soft evolution observed for long grbs , also their high ( with respect to their ) .",
    "the merger scenarios naturally explain the short life of the central engine , and thus the low radiated energy and the quitting of the emission before hard to soft spectral evolution .",
    "in addition , they also predict a weak afterglow emission , as recently observed @xcite , because of the cleaner and lower density circum  burst medium with respect to that predicted by the hypernova scenarios for long grbs , which would cause a very inefficient external shock . in the grb scenarios where most of the prompt emission of long grbs is due to the external shock too",
    ", this naturally explains the lack of long lasting and softening emission in short grbs .",
    "again , this would produce an high average value with respect to the radiate energy , and thus the inconsistency with the correlation holding for long grbs . finally , in order to explain the very low or 0 spectral lag observed in short grbs with respect to long grbs , @xcite consider the hypothesis that the typical @xmath13 of short events is several times that of long ones , and thus of the order of @xmath15001000 , as predicted e.g by the merger model of @xcite .",
    "with such a high lorentz factor , internal shocks are expected to have a low efficiency , and indeed this is one possible explanation for the weakness and softness of xrfs ( e.g barraud et al . 2005 ) .",
    "if we assume the scenario proposed by e.g. @xcite , in which the spectrally hard emission observed in the first seconds of long grbs is due to ( possibly compton dragged ) thermal emission from the photosphere and the later emission to synchrotron processes occurring in internal shocks , the high @xmath13 would thus produce a short  hard emission possibly followed by a weak soft component , as observed for several short grbs @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in figure 3 , in addition to the two short grbs also the prototype event for the grb / sn connection , grb980425/sn1998bw , is characterized by values of and completely inconsistent with the correlation holding for the other events . from an observational point of view , this is a direct consequence of the fact that the event is characterized by a fluence and a measured peak energy in the range of classical long grbs but , based on the commonly accepted association with sn1998bw , it lies at a much lower distance ( z = 0.0085 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows that also another event associated with a sn event , grb031203 , is characterized by a value of which , combined with its low value of , makes it completely inconsistent with the correlation .",
    "given that grb031203 is the most similar event to grb980425 under several points of view ( although lying at a larger distance , z @xmath1 0.1 ) , in particular the strong evidence of association with a sn event ( sn2003lw ) and the low afterglow energy inferred from radio observations @xcite , this inconsistency has been invoked as a further evidence of the existence of a class of close sub ",
    "energetic grbs . however , the lower limit on based on isgri data @xcite and the estimate based on konus data ( table 2 , ulanov et al .",
    "2005 ) are currently debated based on the dust echo observed with xmm ",
    "newton , which could indicate a much softer prompt emission spectrum @xcite .",
    "the sample of grbs with most evidence of association with a sn include also grb030329 ( sn2003dh ) and grb021211 ( sn2002lt ) , which , in converse , are not sub  energetic and are characterized by and values fully consistent with the correlation .",
    "the fact the two closest and sub ",
    "energetic among those grbs most clearly associated with a sn are outliers to the correlation is intriguing . as in the case of short grbs , these evidences show the potential use of the plane to distinguish among different sub  classes of grbs , and have important implications for grb / xrf / sn unification models .",
    "the most common explanations assume that the peculiarity of these events is due to particular and uncommon viewing angles , as proposed e.g. by @xcite for grb980425 and @xcite for grb031203 .",
    "based on relativistic beaming and doppler effects and the assumption of a uniform jet , they find that @xmath14 @xmath38 and @xmath14 @xmath38@xmath46 , where @xmath38 is the relativistic doppler factor ( see section 5.2 ) . for large off ",
    "axis viewing angles the different dependence of and on @xmath38 would cause significant deviations form the correlation . an alternative explanation has been suggested by @xcite in the framework of the cb model @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the spectra of grbs are characterized by two peaks , one at sub ",
    "mev energies , the normal peak following the correlation , and one in the gev  tev range .",
    "when a grb is seen very off  axis , the same relativistic doppler and beaming effects discussed above would shift the high energy peak at low energies , making it to be confused with the normal low energy grb peak . very recently , off ",
    "axis scenarios have been seriously challanged by the detection of a very close ( @xmath47 ) and sub ",
    "energetic event , grb060218/sn2006aj , which , contrary to grb980425 , is characterized by and values fully consistent with the correlation @xcite .",
    "+ finally , @xcite , based on batse data of grbs with unknown redshift found evidence that a part of grb with indications of association with a sn are inconsistent with the correlation , as also the lag ",
    "luminosity relation @xcite , for any value of @xmath0 , which would confirm the existence of a peculiar class of sub ",
    "energetic , sn  associated events .",
    "see , however , next section for a discussion of this method .",
    "the existence of correlations between intrinsic properties of grbs , emerged in the last years thanks to the increasing number of grbs with known redshift , has stimulated their use for the estimate of pseudo  redshifts for large samples of batse grbs . in turn , the pseudo  redshifts estimates have been used to compute the luminosity of large samples of grbs and infer their luminosity function .",
    "this has been done mainly with the correlation between spectral lag and luminosity discovered by @xcite , the variability ",
    "peak luminosity correlation @xcite , and the  peak luminosity correlation @xcite .",
    "in addition , the and correlations , given their low dispersion , have been used for the estimate of cosmological parameters , e.g. , @xcite , in a way similar to that used with type ia sne . with respect to all the above correlations ,",
    "the correlation is based on a much larger sample of grbs , as shown in this work , and is very highly significant .",
    "also , differently from the and correlation , which show a lower dispersion but an higher number of possible outliers ( as discussed above ) , the correlation does not require the detection of a break in the afterglow light curve nor a modelization of the grb jet and circum  burst environment ( as needed for the correlation ) .",
    "thus , in principle the can provide the most reliable pseudo  redshift estimates .",
    "the most straightforward method is to take the fluence and spectral parameters of a grb and compute and , following the same methods used by @xcite or @xcite , for a grid of @xmath0 values ( say from 0.01 to 50 ) .",
    "the pseudo  redshift range will then be given by the values of z for which , accounting for the uncertainties on and and for the extra  poissonian dispersion of the correlation ( as quantified in section 4 and discussed above ) , the corresponding ( , ) points are consistent with the correlation at a given level of significance . in practice , if @xmath6 and @xmath5 are the normalization and index of the power ",
    "law best fitting the correlation ( @xmath1100 and @xmath10.5 if we assume the values determined in section 4 by accounting for sample variance ) , and are the intrinsic peak energy and the isotropic radiated energy at the redshift @xmath0 , the significance of the deviation of the ( , ) point from the correlation is given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the uncertainty on @xmath51 computed from @xmath52 and @xmath53 by error propagation and @xmath54 is the extra  poissonian dispersion of the correlation ( based on the sample variance analysis reported in section 4 , one can for instance assume @xmath54=0.15 ) .",
    "off course , to be more accurate one should also take into account the uncertainties on @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath54 ; however , @xmath6 and @xmath5 are correlated and have low uncertainties ( table 3 ) and for @xmath54 one can conservatively assume the upper bound of the 90% c.l .",
    "interval ( 0.17 ) .",
    "this method , as can be seen by testing it on grbs with known @xmath0 and published spectral parameters , like e.g. the events included in the sample of @xcite or the hete2 events analyzed by @xcite and @xcite , provides reliable but often large ranges of pseudo  z ( or only lower limits ) .",
    "more precise @xmath0 estimates can be obtained with redshift indicators partially based on the correlation , like the one developed by @xcite , which provides redshift estimates accurate to a factor of @xmath12 and is currently used to estimate pseudo  redshifts of hete2 grbs , or its refined version proposed very recently by @xcite .",
    "a caution on the use of these redshift estimators comes from the fact that they are partially empirical and thus are not supported by a complete understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "as already pointed out by @xcite , given the relevance of the correlation , attention has to be paid to the possible impact of selection effects .",
    "recently , two research groups @xcite , by analyzing batse grbs without known redshift , inferred that @xmath1half @xcite or even @xmath180% @xcite of the whole grb population can not satisfy the correlation for any values of redshift .",
    "thus , they conclude that strong selection effects are introduced in the various steps leading from grb detection to the final @xmath0 estimate and that we are measuring the redshift of only those events that follow the correlation . however , there are increasing evidences that the possible impact of selection effects on the correlation and the possible number of outliers are much lower than argued by these authors .",
    "first , their conclusions have been questioned by several other authors @xcite , who found instead that the and fluence values of most batse grbs with unknown redshift are fully consistent with the correlation .",
    "the main source of discrepancy between these two different conclusions lies in accounting or not for the observed dispersion of the correlation and for the uncertainties in the and fluence values .",
    "when accounting for both in the way discussed in previous section , it can be found that only a very small fraction of baste grbs with unknown redshift may be considered outliers to the correlation @xcite .",
    "it has also to be noticed that some of these authors assumed pseudo ",
    "redshifts derived by other correlations , like e.g. the lag  luminosity relation , which are necessarily not the @xmath0 values corresponding to the ( , ) with the minor deviation from the relation found with grbs with known redshift .",
    "an important effect that should be taken into account when using batse data to test the correlation is that , as discussed in previous section , given to the lack of coverage of the x  ray band below @xmath125 kev , batse is likely to overestimate the values at least for a fraction of grbs . and",
    "indeed , @xcite , by fitting the ( , ) points of 442 batse grbs with pseudo  redshifts derived by using the lag  luminosity correlation , find a slope and dispersion consistent with the one obtained with grbs with known redshift , but a higher normalization , which could indicate a systematic overestimate of by batse with respect to and hete2 .",
    "i also note that the possible existence of an correlation was suggested by @xcite based on batse data of grbs without known redshift .    secondly , as a check , i applied the pseudo  redshift estimate method described above to a sample of 46 hete2 grbs with spectral parameters and fluences published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "i considered only those events with both @xmath40 and constrained ; i also discharged the few events in the sample of @xcite with @xmath19@xmath36@xmath412 . when the reported best fit model is a cut  off power ",
    "law , i assumed for @xmath19 the typical value of @xmath412.5 .",
    "for those events contained in both samples , i took the spectral parameters from @xcite , given that it reports results based on data from both wxm and fregate , whereas the analysis of @xcite is based on fregate data only .",
    "the errors on and where derived basing on the errors on spectral parameters and fluences reported in the two references . in the estimate of as a function of @xmath0 i assumed a standard cosmology with @xmath55 = 0.3 , @xmath56=0.7 and @xmath57=65 km s@xmath58 mpc@xmath58 ; for the correlation i assumed @xmath6=100 , @xmath5=0.5 and @xmath54=0.15 .",
    "i find that 38 events ( @xmath183% ) are consistent within 1@xmath7 with the correlation ( i.e. show @xmath48 @xmath591 ) , 5 events ( @xmath111% ) are consistent within 2@xmath7 and 2 ( @xmath14% ) within 3@xmath7 ( with values of 2.1 and 2.7 ) .",
    "the only event with a substantial deviation from the correlation ( 3.82@xmath7 ) is the short grb020531 .",
    "it is also important to note that the pseudo  redshift ranges obtained are fully consistent with the observed @xmath0 distribution .",
    "these results show that at least most of hete2 grbs with unknown @xmath0 are potentially fully consistent with the correlation holding for long grbs and give a further evidence that short grbs do not follow this correlation .",
    "thus , if there are selection effects in the sample of hete2 grbs with known redshift , on which the correlation is partly based , they are more likely due to detectors sensitivity as a function of energy than to the subsequent processes leading to redshift estimate .",
    "however , the fact that the distribution of these grbs in the fluence  plane is consistent with that of batse events ( figure 16 of sakamoto et al .",
    "2005b ) indicates that the possible inconsistency of a fraction of batse grbs with unknown redshift with the correlation may be due to an overestimate of , as a consequence of the effects discussed above and in section 5.3 . + a third important issue concerns",
    "the fact that , as discussed in section 4 and shown in figures 2 and 3 , all grbs with known redshift are consistent with the correlation .",
    "this is a strong evidence against the existence of relevant selection effects in the updated sample of grbs with known redshift on which the correlation study here presented is based , because : a ) the burst detection sensitivity of /bat in @xmath115300 kev is comparable to that of batse and better than that of and hete2 ( see however band 2003 for a comparison of the sensitivities of these different detectors as a function of energy ) , which in the past years contributed nearly all the measurements on which the correlation was based ; b ) the very fast and precise localization capabilities of /xrt allowed to substantially reduce the selection effects also in the process leading to redshift estimate ( grb precise localization , optical follow  up , optical afterglow and/or host galaxy detection and spectroscopy ) .",
    "a drawback of bat is that it can provide an estimate of only for a small fraction of events ( 1520% at most ) .",
    "+ basing on the above , it is unlikely that the correlation is strongly affected by selection effects .",
    "anyway , the existence of sub  classes of grbs not following it can not be excluded .",
    "as discussed in previous section , the analysis of the sample of grbs with known redshift and shows that , in addition to short grbs , a class of sub  energetic events ( like grb980425 and possibly grb031203 ) with spectral  energy properties inconsistent with the correlation may exist .",
    "the possibile existence of a fraction of long grbs is also predicted by some grb synthesis models , like , e.g. , the one by @xcite based on off  jet relativistic kinematics effects .",
    "obviously , the most reliable test of the correlation and of the existence of one or more sub  classes of outliers will come from the ongoing quick enlargement of the sample of grbs with known redshift and both in number , thanks to fast and precise localizations , and in the coverage of the fluence plane , as allowed by the grb experiments with different energy bands and sensitivity presently operating , like /bat",
    ", hete2 , konus / wind , suzaku / wam , integral / isgri , or that will fly in the next future , like , e.g. , those on board agile and glast .",
    "i am grateful to c. guidorzi and r. landi for their help in parts of the analysis here reported .",
    "i thank f. frontera , c. guidorzi and e. montanari for useful discussions and their contribution to the development of the method used to fit the data accounting for sample variance .",
    "i wish also to thank g. ghirlanda for useful discussion and the anonymous referee for his / her very careful reading of the paper and for comments and suggestions which improved its quality .",

    "<S> the correlation between the cosmological rest  frame spectrum peak energy , , and the isotropic equivalent radiated energy , , discovered by amati et al . in 2002 and confirmed / extended by subsequent osbervations , is one of the most intriguing and debated observational evidences in gamma  ray bursts ( grb ) astrophysics . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i provide an update and a re  analysis of the correlation basing on an updated sample consisting of 41 long grbs / xrfs with firm estimates of @xmath0 and observed peak energy , , 12 grbs with uncertain valeus of @xmath0 and/or , 2 short grbs with firm estimates of @xmath0 and and the peculiar sub  energetic events grb980425/sn1998bw and grb031203/sn2003lw . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to standard correlation analysis and power  law fitting , the data analysis here reported includes a modelization which accounts for sample variance . </S>",
    "<S> all 53 classical long grbs and xrfs , including 11 events with published spectral parameters and fluences , have and values , or upper / lower limits , consistent with the correlation , which shows a chance probability as low as @xmath17@xmath210@xmath3 , a slope of @xmath10.57 ( @xmath10.5 when fitting by accounting for sample variance ) and an extra  poissonian logarithmic dispersion of @xmath10.15 , it extends over @xmath15 orders of magnitude in and @xmath13 orders of magnitude in and holds from the closer to the higher @xmath0 grbs . sub </S>",
    "<S>  energetic grbs ( 980425 and possibly 031203 ) and short grbs are found to be inconsistent with the correlation , showing that it can be a powerful tool for discriminating different classes of grbs and understanding their nature and differences . </S>",
    "<S> i also discuss the main implications of the updated correlation for the models of the physics and geometry of grb emission , its use as a pseudo  redshift estimator and the tests of possible selection effects with grbs of unknown redshift .    </S>",
