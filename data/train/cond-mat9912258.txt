    "in the recent years a renewed interest on the glass transition phenomenon has motivated extensive experimental and theoretical works ( see  @xcite and reference therein ) . on the theoretical side , new descriptions of the glass transition has been developed : they emphasized either the dynamic ( as the mode coupling theory ( mct ) of gtze  @xcite or the coupled oscillators model of ngai and tsang  @xcite ) or the thermodynamic ( as the first principle computation based on a replica formulation of  @xcite or the inherent structure formalism computation of  @xcite ) aspects of the transition itself .",
    "a common feature of all these theories is they have been developed for `` model systems '' , often monoatomic models .",
    "the comparison of the theoretical results with the real experiment are , therefore , complicated by the trivial observation that in the real world the glass forming systems are made out of `` molecular systems '' . as a consequence in the current literature",
    "there is a large debate on the applicability of the theoretical predictions to the experimental outcome and the more stringent tests of the theories come from molecular dynamics ( md ) works .    as an example , it is highly debated in literature the origin , in molecular glassformer , of _ secondary _ relaxations that can be observed by several experimental techniques beside the well - known microscopic and structural dynamics ( see , among others , @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "for instance , _ fast _ relaxations ( i. e. in the @xmath0 s range ) have been observed in several glasses and it is not yet clear if their origin is related to the molecular center of mass motion , as mct would explain in terms of @xmath1-process , or rather to rotational or intramolecular dynamics .",
    "it is clear the crucial role that md simulations can play to solve this specific problem . if it is possible to build a",
    "_ realistic _",
    "model able to take into account the internal degrees of freedom , as well as the translational dynamics , computer simulations allow one to access any observable quantity of the system , also those not directly measurable by present experimental techniques . such possibility , together with the physical intuition , could allow the identification of the microscopic mechanisms underlying the different observed relaxation processes .    in this paper",
    "we want to address the problem to set up a `` realistic '' potential for a glass model system capable to account for the internal molecular degrees of freedom . among the glassforming molecular liquids characterized by an extremely rich dynamical behavior , the organic _ fragile _",

    "[ otp ] , is known from neutron  @xcite and x - ray  @xcite diffraction studies ; in condensed state the otp molecules are bound together only by van der waals forces , which resemble the lennard - jones ones often used by most theories and computer simulations aiming to study the glass transition problem .    due to its structural complexity , if we would like to obtain reliable results to be compared with experimental data , we need to take into account not only the translations of the molecular center of masses and the rotations of the molecules as a whole , but also intramolecular motions like stretching along the molecular bonds , tilt of the bonds , rotation of the side rings with respect to the central one and so on . in other words , we need to describe the dynamics of the liquid at _ atomic _ level . on the contrary , in order to set up a computational scheme which is affordable in not - too - long time with the nowadays computer capability , we need the _ simplest _ model potential able to capture the relevant features of the dynamical behavior of the real system .    in the literature numerical studies of otp have been proposed making use of different techniques ranging from _ harmonic lattice dynamics _",

    "the intermolecular interaction is of lj type and , as internal degrees of freedom , only the rotational dynamics of the side rings with respect to the central one is taken into account .",
    "these internal degrees of freedom are effectively the most relevant , nevertheless the authors parameterize the potential in such a way that the side rings are , at equilibrium , in a configuration that corresponds to a saddle point in the molecular energy surface .",
    "the model potential we are going to introduce results to be much more efficient in mimicking the complexity of the dynamical behavior of the real system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the intramolecular model potential ; in section  [ force constants ] we explain how we calculated the force constants in order to reproduce a realistic isolated molecule vibrational spectrum . in section  [ computation ]",
    "we present some computational details and in section  [ mct ] we remind some of the main well - established predictions of the ideal mode coupling theory used in section  [ results ] to test the center of mass dynamical behavior ; in section  [ results ] we discuss our md simulation results mainly with regard to the study of the diffusion and self - dynamic properties .",
    "the last section contains an overall discussion and the conclusions .",
    "in our model the otp molecule is constituted by three _ rigid _ hexagons ( phenyl rings ) of side @xmath5 nm connected as shown in fig .  [ otp ] , i.  e. two adjacent vertices of the _ parent _ ( central ) ring are bonded to one vertex of the two _ side _ rings by bonds whose length , at equilibrium , is @xmath6 nm . in our scheme ,",
    "each vertex of the hexagons is thought to be occupied by a fictious atom of mass @xmath7 a.m.u .",
    "representing a carbon - hydrogen pair ( c - h ) .",
    "the choice of such a fictious atom , with its renormalized mass , greatly simplify the computer simulation but presents some drawbacks : _",
    "i ) _ in the real molecule the two couples of carbon atoms connecting the rings are not bonded to hydrogen atoms , while in our model we consider all the 18 vertices having the same mass @xmath8 so that the total molecular mass is overestimated ( 234 rather than 230 a.m.u ) and _ ii ) _ the moments of inertia of the model rings are smaller than the real ones the hydrogen atoms being too close to the ring center .",
    "nevertheless , we expect only minor effects on the overall dynamics from the previous simplification .",
    "the three rings of a given molecule interact among themselves by an _",
    "intramolecular _ potential , such potential being chosen _",
    "i _ ) to preserve the molecule from `` dissociation '' ; _ ii _ ) to give the correct relative equilibrium positions for the three rings ; _ iii _ ) to represent the real intramolecular vibrational spectrum as close as possible . the interaction among different molecules , actually among the rings pertaining to different molecules , is accounted for by a site - site pairwise additive potential energy of the ( 6 - 12 ) lennard - jones type , each site being one of the hexagons vertices .    to sum up",
    ", the total interaction potential energy is written as the sum of an _ intermolecular _ and an _ intramolecular _ term : @xmath9 the first term can be written explicitly as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the position of the @xmath12-th atom ( @xmath12=1  6 ) in the @xmath13-th ring ( @xmath13=1  3 , hereafter @xmath13=1 indicates the parent ring ) belonging to the @xmath14-th molecule ( @xmath14=1  n ) , and @xmath15 .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] the optimal choice of the two intermolecular force parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , will be discussed later .    in principle",
    ", the _ intramolecular _ interaction potential can be expressed in terms of the degrees of freedom describing the center of mass positions ( @xmath18 , @xmath13=2,3 ) and orientations ( e.g. the set of eulerian angles ) of the side rings with respect to the parent ring . however ,",
    "for computational purposes , it is simpler to express the intramolecular potential in terms of orthonormal unit vectors attached to each ring or better in terms of quantities built from these vectors . with reference to fig .",
    "[ geometry ] the sets of unit vectors for each ring @xmath19 are defined as    @xmath20    i.e. @xmath21 and @xmath22 are orthogonal unit vectors in the ring plane , while @xmath23 is the normal to that plane .",
    "the unit vectors that are parallel to the ring - ring bonds at equilibrium , are given by @xmath24    the positions of the four carbon atoms that link the three rings , i.e",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 in the parent ring and @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the side rings , are given by , with respect to their ring centers @xmath18 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "finally , it is useful to define four further interaction sites two pertaining to the parent ring , @xmath33 and @xmath34 and two pertaining to the side rings ( 2 and 3 respectively ) , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . here @xmath37 , so that at the equilibrium position @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    the variable we have introduced will be used to simply express the different contributions to the intramolecular potential in the next subsections .",
    "the fluctuations of the distances among the centers of mass of the three rings are accounted for by introducing three `` springs '' .",
    "the parent - side ring stretching implies the elongation of a c - c bond , which is expected to have a high stiffness .",
    "the corresponding potential in harmonic approximation is written as : @xmath40^{2}+\\\\ & & c_{1 } \\left [ \\vert { \\bar p}_{1(3)}-{\\bar p}_{3}\\vert -l_b \\right ] ^{2 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , no direct chemical bond is present between the two side rings , and we expect a less stiff spring for the fluctuation of the distance between the side ring centers .",
    "we model this interaction by : @xmath41^{2}\\ ] ] the determination of the force constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 , as well as the others we are going to introduce , will be discussed later .      in the otp crystal structure@xcite , the bond angles @xmath44 and are 123.6@xmath45 and 123.0@xmath45 respectively , while the angles @xmath46 and @xmath47 are 118.4@xmath45 and 117.4@xmath45 ( see fig .  [ geometry ] ) further , in the isolated molecule , the ring - ring bonds are forced out of the plane of the parent ring so that the dihedral angle is 5.2@xmath45 .",
    "this lack of planarity is due to the little asymmetry introduced by the difference between a carbon bonded to an hydrogen and a carbon bonded to a carbon of another ring . in our model , all these angles at the equilibrium are put equal to 120@xmath45 and @xmath48 equal to @xmath49 .",
    "we model the restoring forces for these angles by using the scalar product of the unit vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( as well as that of @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "being , at equilibrium , the quadratic term in the small oscillation approximation is given by : @xmath54 however , this term is not enough to ensure the co - planarity of the vectors @xmath50 and @xmath55 with the parent ring ; to force the rings towards the co - planar equilibrium condition we make use of the `` sites '' @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( as well as @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) introducing between them a spring of vanishing equilibrium length : @xmath60      inside the intramolecular dynamics , we expect that a crucial role is played by the rotation of the side rings planes around the ring - ring bonds@xcite in interfering or modifying the intermolecular relaxation processes .",
    "the relevant variables describing this motion are the two angles @xmath61 between the normals to the side ring and parent ring planes . in the crystalline structure ,",
    "the two side rings have slightly different angles , 42.4@xmath45 and 62.0@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "however we model the disordered condensed phases ( liquid and glass ) by using as equilibrium angle values those of the isolated molecule , i.e. 54.0@xmath45 , as discussed below .",
    "we have to remark that the isolated molecule symmetry implies two iso - energetic configurations separated by a finite barrier as is qualitatively illustrated in fig .  [ map ] .",
    "we performed an _ ab - initio _ calculation of the single molecule potential energy surface as a function of @xmath62 and @xmath63 with all the other internal degrees of freedom fixed to their equilibrium values .",
    "such calculation consists in the minimization of the hartree - fock energy over the gaussian basis set 3 - 21 g .",
    "for each atomic species the inner shell is made up of 3 gaussians while the valence shell is a linear combination of 2 gaussians orbital plus a 1 gaussian orbital ; the minimization was carried out by the standard package gaussian 94 . in fig .",
    "[ map ] a contour plot of the hartree - fock potential energy is shown as a function of the rotation angles .",
    "it is important to quote that this map has only a semi - quantitative meaning , the structure of the whole molecule being not re - optimized during the scan of @xmath62 and @xmath63 angles . however , a careful study , performed reoptimizing the whole molecular structure , has been done around the saddle point @xmath64 and around the two equivalent minima that turn out to be at @xmath65 and @xmath66 . from this calculation the barrier height has been estimated to be @xmath67 and , from this value , it is possible to envisage the nature of the rotational motion at the temperatures of interest : the two side rings can pivot in phase around the bonds crossing from one minimum to the other degenerate one . moreover they can perform librational out - of - phase motions of ( approximatively ) harmonic type .    in order to represent this potential surface",
    "we express the in - phase rotation of the two side rings with a high - order ( 6th ) polynomium and the out - of - phase rotation in the harmonic approximation . for this purpose",
    "we use as primary variables the scalar products @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( their equilibrium value being @xmath70 ) and to disentangle the in - phase from the out - of - phase motion , we introduce the two variables : @xmath71 the final form of the `` internal rotation '' potential will be @xmath72 with @xmath73    the parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 describing the in - phase rotation potential are derived according to the following procedure . in the harmonic approximation , in proximity of the equilibrium position @xmath77 for the scalar products , it must hold @xmath78 and taking into account that the barrier height must be equal to @xmath79 , we have the following conditions : @xmath80 implying @xmath81",

    "other model details are reported on ref .",
    "we have studied a system composed by 108 molecules ( 324 rings , 1944 interaction centers ) ; the sample is large enough to neglect finite size effects on the investigated properties with reasonable computation times .",

    "( [ torsion ] ) is needed : such potential presents a serious drawback since the intrinsic ambiguity due to the parity of the scalar products involved can force the side rings in the wrong positions",
    ". this problem can be bypassed introducing a new term in the intramolecular potential that gives zero contribution to the energy when the molecule is close to the equilibrium position .",
    "if we define the product @xmath100 , and we put @xmath101 ( the actual value of @xmath102 is irrelevant , it must only be able to force the rings in the right way ) we can write @xmath103 this term has been activated only during the preparation of the initial configuration ( i.  e. at high temperature ) ; during the thermalized evolution of the system we expect molecules do not drive too much away from their equilibrium configuration and then this term to be always equal to zero .    to integrate the equations of motion we have treated each ring as a separate rigid body , identified by the position of its center of mass @xmath104 and by its orientation expressed in terms of quaternions @xmath105 @xcite .",
