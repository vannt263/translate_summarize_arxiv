    "the tremendous progress in the last decade has made it possible to pin down , with impressive accuracy , many of the fundamental parameters in the neutrino sector . a complete picture , however , is still not available .",
    "chief among the missing information is the determination of the @xmath1 element of the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath2 , which , in turn , is crucial in ascertaining the cp violation effects in the leptonic sector . given that direct cp violations in the quark sector @xcite have been well - established and accurately measured , it is imperative , from both the theoretical and experimental points of view , to assess the corresponding situation in the leptonic sector .",
    "another unsolved puzzle concerns the neutrino mass spectrum , in that there are the possibilities of either the  normal \" or  inverted \" orderings .",
    "it is certainly important to settle this question .",
    "while the fundamental parameters refer to those in vacuum , it has been well - established ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref.@xcite ) that they are modified when neutrinos propagate through matter , by giving the neutrino an induced mass , which is proportional to its energy and to the medium density . indeed , in the analyses of the solar neutrinos , certain features of the data , such as the modification of the energy spectra from the original , can only be understood by the inclusion of matter effects . with the advent of long baseline experiments ( lbl , for an incomplete list , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref.@xcite ) , the induced mass can actually be  tuned \" by changing the neutrino energy ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this provides a powerful tool which can be used to extract fundamental neutrino parameters from measurements .    in this work",
    ", we will use a rephasing invariant parametrization which enables us to obtain simple formulas for the transition probabilities of neutrinos propagating through matter of constant density .",
    "it was shown earlier that these parameters obey evolution equations as a function of the induced mass .",
    "in addition , these equations preserve the approximate @xmath0 symmetry @xcite which characterizes the neutrino mixing in vacuum .",
    "incorporation of the @xmath0 symmetry for all induced mass values results in a set of very simple transition probabilities @xmath4 . in general , these formulas offer quick estimates of the various oscillation probabilities , using the known solutions obtained earlier . as an example , we will analyze @xmath5 in detail , emphasizing its dependence on the neutrino parameters .",
    "neutrino oscillations , being lepton - number conserving , are described in terms of a mixing matrix whose possible majorana phases are not observable .",
    "thus it behaves just like the ckm matrix under rephasing transformations , which leave physical observables invariant @xcite . to date , however , such observables are often given in terms of parameters which are not individually invariant .",
    "so it seems that the use of manifestly invariant parameters may be more physically relevant .",
    "two such sets are known to be @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recently , by imposing the condition @xmath8 ( without loss of generality ) , another set was found , given by @xcite @xmath9 where the common imaginary part can be identified with the jarlskog invariant @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "their real parts are labeled as @xmath11 the variables are bounded by @xmath12 with @xmath13 for any ( @xmath14 ) , and satisfy two constraints : @xmath15 @xmath16 eq .

    "thus , flavor mixing is specified by the set @xmath19 plus a sign , according to @xmath20 .",
    "this sign arises since the transformation @xmath21 , corresponding to a cp conjugation , leaves the real part @xmath19 of @xmath22 invariant , but changes the sign of its imaginary part @xmath23 . note that , using @xmath24 , a complete parametrization also requires four @xmath24 elements plus a sign .",

    "another possible application is to look for both @xmath214 and @xmath215 for a single , but very long baseline .",
    "since the @xmath121 s only go through the higher resonance under the inverted hierarchy , one would expect to observe in the vicinity of the peak either @xmath216 if the hierarchy is normal , or @xmath217 if the hierarchy is inverted .",
    "we show an example in fig .",
    "4 . note that although the peak value of the probability varies with the baseline length , the relative and qualitative features of the above observation remain valid for a chosen baseline .",
