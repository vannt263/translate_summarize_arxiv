    "in 1935 , wigner and huntington @xcite predicted that the molecules in solid molecular hydrogen at very high pressure would dissociate to form a metallic atomic solid .",
    "solid hydrogen is expected to transform into a metallic liquid ground state at high pressure,@xcite may exhibit high - t@xmath3 superconductivity and superfluidity,@xcite and plays an important role in astrophysics.@xcite although it is not yet possible to reach the static pressure of more than 400 gpa normally thought necessary to dissociate the hydrogen molecules , recent experimental results obtained using diamond anvil cell techniques have been interpreted as indicating metallization and the transition of molecular hydrogen to an atomic liquid , known as phase iv , below 300 gpa.@xcite other experimental groups disagree , observing no evidence of the optical conductivity expected of a metal over the entire range of temperatures to the highest pressures explored , and no signature of an atomic liquid.@xcite the interpretation of experimental results is complicated by the fact that , unlike phase i ( @xmath4 gpa ) , which is a molecular solid of quantum rotors on a hexagonal close packed lattice , the structures of phase ii ( known as the broken - symmetry phase@xcite ) and phase iii ( @xmath5 gpa ) are unknown.@xcite in addition , it remains unclear whether or not phase iii is metallic.@xcite    metallization is believed to occur either via the dissociation of hydrogen molecules and a structural transformation to an atomic metallic phase or via band overlap ( band - gap closure ) within the molecular phase .",
    "there is more evidence in favor of the latter assumption .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations of metallic hydrogen @xcite and our knowledge of the experimental equation of state@xcite suggest that the hydrogen molecules remain undissociated at pressures up to 620 gpa .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations using the ab initio random structure searching approach@xcite predict dissociation near 500 gpa,@xcite whilst dft calculations using evolutionary techniques@xcite predict that the formation of stable non - molecular metallic hydrogen requires pressures much higher than 600 gpa.@xcite these values are so large that it seems likely that metallization takes place by band - gap closure in the molecular phase well before dissociation occurs .",
    "experimental vibrational and scattering results are not yet sufficient to allow an unambiguous determination of the structure of phase iii , leaving theorists free to speculate.@xcite however , the range of structures proposed is so wide and the energy differences between them so small ( typically a few mev / proton ) that it is unclear which , if any , corresponds to the global free energy minimum .",
    "finding the most stable arrangements of atoms in solids and molecules is and will remain a very difficult task , but significant progress has been made over the past few years .",
    "recent advances based on simulated annealing , metadynamics , random sampling , evolutionary algorithms , basin hopping , minima hopping , and data mining , are discussed in ref .  .",
    "the ab initio random structure searching method@xcite has also been used to investigate the zero - temperature phase diagram of molecular solid hydrogen.@xcite searches excluding the effects of proton zero - point energy ( zpe ) found a sequence of molecular crystal structures within the pressure range over which phase iii is observed experimentally .",
    "the c2/c structure was stable up to 270 gpa ; cmca-12 was stable from 270 gpa to 385 gpa ; and cmca was stable above 385 gpa .",
    "the consequences of including proton zpe ( see section  iv ) were investigated only after the structures had been found . ref .   provided many new ideas about the phase diagram of solid molecular hydrogen , but the energies of the crystal structures considered were obtained using a simple semi - local approximation to the unknown exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional of density functional theory ( dft ) , which may or may not be accurate .",
    "moreover , since dft substantially underestimates the fundamental band gap for essentially all materials , it also underestimates the pressure at which the band gap closes.@xcite finally , it is worth noting that crystal structures obtained using random searching do not always agree with structures obtained using other techniques or experiment.@xcite this is not surprising , as the probability that a random search will find the ground state decreases exponentially with increasing system size.@xcite    dft is one of very few quantum mechanical methods capable of calculating the energies and enthalpies of all phases of interest over all relevant pressure regimes and has played an important role in studies of high - pressure hydrogen .",
    "however , serious doubts about the accuracy of the results persist .",
    "how do the inter - atomic interaction energy , the bond - stretch energy , the phase diagram , the metallization mechanism , and the phonon spectrum depend on the approximation used for the xc functional ?",
    "how accurate should we expect dft calculations of measured quantities such as infra - red ( ir ) and raman spectra to be ?",
    "answering these questions is necessary to assess the reliability of the many existing dft simulations of high - pressure solid hydrogen.@xcite on the minus side , because the enthalpy differences between rival structures are so small ( a few mev / proton ) , it is very difficult to be sure that a specific structure represents the global minimum .",
    "the failures of dft to describe water and other systems containing hydrogen at low pressure and temperature have already been documented.@xcite perhaps surprisingly , the errors of dft are already troublesome even for a single h@xmath6o molecule : it was shown recently @xcite that some common xc functionals provide rather poor estimates of the o ",
    "h bond - stretch energy . because of the limited experimental data , theoretical and computational studies have an unusually important role to play in the study of solid hydrogen , but only if they are correct .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to investigate the successes and failures of several widely used xc functionals in the study of high - pressure solid hydrogen .",
    "we emphasize that the failures we identify do not signal a breakdown of dft itself ; they demonstrate only the limited accuracy of certain xc functionals .",
    "we believe that identifying and investigating deficiencies such as these provides useful information to developers of new xc functionals and may bring us closer to one of the main goals of dft , which is to design functionals capable of providing accurate total energies for as wide a variety of systems as possible .",
    "starting at the static level of theory , we calculate the zero - temperature phase diagram using three different functionals : the perdew - zunger ( pz ) parameterization of the local density approximation@xcite ( lda ) , the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) version of the generalized gradient approximation@xcite ( gga ) , and the semi - local becke - lee - yang - parr ( blyp ) functional.@xcite we focus on four specific structures with space groups p@xmath0/m , c2/c , cmca-12 , and cmca . according to previous static dft calculations using the pbe functional,@xcite these are stable in the pressure ranges @xmath7 105 gpa , 105270 gpa , 270385 gpa , and 385490 gpa , respectively .    nuclear quantum effects are generally neglected in dft calculations because of computational cost . however , there is strong evidence to show that this neglect has a significant impact on the results for solid hydrogen , even at finite temperature.@xcite we investigate quantum nuclear effects at zero temperature by calculating the proton zpe as a function of pressure within the quasi - harmonic approximation .",
    "our calculations of the phonon spectrum also enable us to investigate the effect of the choice of xc functional on the frequencies of the raman and ir active modes .",
    "we demonstrate that adding the proton zpe to the calculated enthalpy produces `` dynamic '' phase diagrams in better agreement with experiment than the static phase diagrams obtained excluding zpe .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the details of our dft calculations .",
    "section iii investigates the effect of the choice of xc functional on the calculated phase diagram and metallization pressure of solid molecular hydrogen at the static level of theory , and shows how the choice of functional affects the pressures at which the phase transitions i @xmath8 ii @xmath8 iii are predicted to take place . in section iv , we go beyond the static level by investigating the effects of zpe .",
    "section vi concludes .",
    "since the energy differences between high - pressure solid molecular structures are very small , the calculations must be done with the highest possible numerical precision .",
    "our dft calculations were carried out within the pseudopotential and plane - wave approach using the quantum espresso suite of programs.@xcite all calculations used norm - conserving pseudopotentials and a basis set of plane waves with a cutoff of 200 ry .",
    "geometry and cell optimizations employed a dense @xmath9 @xmath10-point mesh .",
    "the bfgs quasi - newton algorithm was used for cell and geometry optimization , with convergence thresholds on the total energy and forces of 0.01 mry and 0.1 mry / bohr , respectively , to guarantee convergence of the total energy to better than 1 mev / proton and the pressure to better than 0.1 gpa / proton .    to include the effects of zpe and investigate the phonon spectrum ,",

    "[ enthalpieszpe](c ) , shows a metal - insulator transition at 350360 gpa , related to a phase transition from the c2/c structure to the cmca structure .",
    "the dynamic phase diagrams also suggest that metallization of high - pressure solid hydrogen happens through a molecular structural transformation , not band - gap closure .",
    "the pressure at which the band gap of the c2/c phase closes , as shown in table  [ dftgap ] and also as calculated using the more accurate @xmath23 approximation,@xcite is considerably higher than the pressure at which the transition to the metallic cmca structure takes place .",
    "since metallization is likely to take place via a structural transformation , the failure of dft to produce accurate band gaps is unlikely to be relevant .",
    "last , but not least , we ask why dft is unable to reproduce the phase diagram of high - pressure solid hydrogen .",
    "we believe that there are two main problems .",
    "one is caused by the very small enthalpy differences of a few mev per proton between phases .",
    "exhaustive tests for molecules , where accurate results can be obtained using quantum chemical methods , have shown that no current xc functional is consistently capable of achieving such accuracy.@xcite the second is the many - body self - interaction ( xc - si ) error present in the xc functionals used here .",
    "a systematic investigation@xcite found the xc - si errors of the lda , gga , and blyp total energies of a single h@xmath6 molecule to be 1.264 , -0.126 , and 0.0846 ev , respectively .",
    "these values are more than two orders of magnitude larger than the dft enthalpy differences between the crystal structures of high - pressure solid hydrogen .",
    "the gga functional has a lower x - sie than the lda functional , but the c - sie , which is negative by definition , is larger than the x - sie in this case .",
    "the xc - sie of the blyp functional is relatively small because the lyp functional by construction does not suffer from the c - sie . in previous work@xcite",
    "we showed that the use of hybrid xc functionals , which generally suffer from smaller xc - si errors than pure density functionals,@xcite changes the phase diagram considerably .",
    "this paper reported dft calculations using the lda , pbe and blyp xc functionals of various proposed structures of solid molecular hydrogen at low temperature and high pressure .",
    "static results obtained using all three xc functionals are consistent with the following scenario : at the highest pressures considered here , the cmca-12 structure , which is insulating at low pressure but becomes semi - metallic with increasing pressure , transforms into the cmca structure , which is metallic even at low pressure .",
    "since the cmca-12 and cmca structures have the same space group , differing only in the number of hydrogen molecules per unit cell , this seems reasonable .",
    "more generally , as the pressure is increased , the band gaps of the insulating structures of solid hydrogen become smaller . as the band gaps decrease , we find that structures with wider gaps become progressively less stable relative to structures with smaller gaps , and a series of transitions to structures with smaller gaps takes place .",
    "this process culminates in the transition to the metallic cmca structure .",
    "the above scenario changes significantly when the effects of proton zpe are added to the static phase diagram .",
    "our zpe calculations were based on the harmonic approximation , which is standard but may be problematic .",
    "however , it is clear from our results that the effects of proton zpe are essential and must be taken into account , even if only approximately .",
    "surprisingly , but perhaps fortuitously , the agreement between the pbe and blyp dynamic phase diagrams is much better than the agreement between the corresponding static phase diagrams . in particular , both dynamic phase diagrams suggest that the experimentally observed i - ii phase transition corresponds to a structural transformation from p@xmath0/m to c2/c , that c2/c is the most stable of the structures considered over the whole pressure range of phases ii and iii , and that metallization happens via a molecular structural transformation from c2/c to cmca without passing through cmca-12 .",
    "the main difference between the pbe and blyp dynamic phase diagrams is the pressure of the c2/c to cmca transition , which the pbe functional places at 240250 gpa and the blyp functional places at 350360 gpa . as discussed above ,",
    "both results can be interpreted as being in agreement with recent experimental results , but different and conflicting ones .",
    "the low - frequency ( @xmath7 2200 @xmath2 ) parts of the phonon spectra of all structures considered are surprisingly independent of the choice of xc functional , but this is not true of the high - frequency vibronic parts . in general , it appears that the blyp functional produces stiffer phonons than the pbe functional and considerably stiffer phonons than the lda functional .",
    "this work focused on four specific crystal structures recently proposed on the basis of pbe calculations.@xcite although the phase diagrams obtained using different xc functionals differed substantially in quantitative terms , especially at the static level , the four structures always appeared in the same order as the pressure was increased .",
    "we think it likely , however , that if we had considered a wider range of structures , we would have seen qualitative as well as quantitative differences between the phase diagrams calculated using different xc functionals .",
    "dft is probably not accurate enough to allow reliable comparisons of the stabilities of the insulating , semi - metallic , and metallic phases of solid molecular hydrogen . indeed ,",
    "since simple dft calculations fail to describe van der waals interactions and severely underestimate band gaps , it would be unreasonably optimistic to expect such comparisons to be reliable .",
    "we conclude that using dft results as the basis of our understanding of high - pressure solid hydrogen is likely to lead to serious errors . to obtain reliable results ,",
    "it is almost certainly necessary to go beyond dft and take many - body effects properly into account.@xcite in any case , it is clear that more work needs to be done , both theoretically and experimentally , to understand solid molecular hydrogen at low temperature ."
