    "many attempts@xcite have been made to replace the @xmath1 grading group that is usually used in supersymmetry@xcite by another abelian group .",
    "most of these attempts deal with @xmath2 grading groups and the corresponding generalized lie algebras , that are called color lie superalgebras .",
    "it has been shown by scheunert@xcite that any @xmath3-lie superalgebra , of which the color lie superalgebras are particular cases , is isomorphic to an ordinary lie superalgebra , leaving little room for a generalization of supersymmetry based on an alternative grading group , at least at the level of the lie superalgebra .",
    "attempts have also been made to generalize supersymmetry by replacing the grassmann algebra with a paragrassmann algebra , but it is not clear what the algebraic structures corresponding to lie superalgebras are in this case , and these algebras are very unsymmetrical : they need an ordering relation between the generators@xcite .",
    "we build a generalization of the grassmann algebras from different assumptions and build the corresponding generalized supersymmetry generators .",
    "the resulting algebraic structure is an @xmath3-lie superalgebra ( the jacobi identity is satisfied ) , and it has a subalgebra that is a lie superalgebra .",
    "any grading group @xmath4 , being commutative , can be decomposed into the product of @xmath5 or @xmath6 groups @xmath7 where @xmath8 is @xmath9 by convention for a @xmath5 group .",
    "if an element @xmath10 of a @xmath4-graded structure is of grade @xmath11 , we will note @xmath12 to distinguish the integers caracterizing the grade of @xmath10 in each of the @xmath13 groups .",
    "one can then define a @xmath4-graded commutation factor , whose general form@xcite is @xmath14 where the @xmath15 are @xmath16 roots of unity , @xmath17 being the greatest common divider of @xmath8 and @xmath18 .",
    "one can choose @xmath19 in the first factors only in the case where @xmath8 is even .",
    "the assumptions we make about our generalized grassmann algebra are that :    * it is @xmath20-commutative , that is @xmath21 for all @xmath10 and @xmath22 in the algebra , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the grades of @xmath10 and @xmath22 .",
    "* the @xmath13 groups are all equivalent and undistinguishable . *",
    "it contains a fermionic sector ( formed with elements that anticommute with each other ) that put on an equal footing the @xmath13 groups .",
    "any grassmann algebra satisfying these assumptions with a grading group composed of the product of two @xmath13 groups is isomorphic to an ordinary grassmann algebra .",
    "no grassmann algebra with a grading group composed of the product of four or more @xmath13 groups is able to put them on an equal footing , unless it is isomorphic to an ordinary grassmann algebra .",
    "this is because it is impossible to build a symmetric oriented graph with four points . here",
    "are the four possible oriented graphs with four points : if we allow for different commutation factors between different grading groups , then the _ pairs _ of groups become distinguishable . on the other hand , with three points ,",
    "it is possible to build a symmetric oriented graph . here",
    "are the two possible oriented graphs with three points : note that the paragrassmann algebras with three and four generators are described by the first triangle and tetrahedron .",
    "the second triangle is perfectly symmetric in the three points and can be used to build our generalized grassmann algebra .",
    "we chose here to label each @xmath25 group with a color , red , green or blue and to note @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 the components in the red , green and blue @xmath25 groups of an element @xmath11 of the grading group .",
    "the corresponding commutation factor is @xmath29 and the smallest grading group is @xmath30 if @xmath31 is an @xmath32 root of @xmath33 with @xmath34 even , @xmath35 if @xmath31 is an @xmath32 root of @xmath33 with @xmath34 odd , or @xmath36 if @xmath31 is not a root of @xmath33 ( in this case , we set @xmath37 ) .",
    "let us examine in detail the generators one can have in our algebra and their commutation relations .",
    "we can have monochromatic generators having only one of their three colors equal to one .",
    "then , one can have `` anti - monochromatic '' generators that have one of their colors equal to @xmath19 .",
    "these are the conjugates of monochromatic generators .",
    "then , one can have `` black '' generators with all their colors zero and `` white '' generators with their three colors all equal but different from zero .",
    "there are other combinations but we wo nt concentrate on them for the moment .",
    "let us denote by @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 the red , green and blue monochromatic generators , by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 the red , green and blue anti - monochromatic generators , by @xmath44 the black generators and by @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath46 ) the white ( resp .",
    "anti - white , that is , with all colors equal to @xmath19 ) generators .",
    "we summarize this in the following table : @xmath47 and take the convention that capitalized latin indices refer to monochromatic degrees of freedom , small latin indices to black degrees of freedom and greek indices to white degrees of freedom .",
    "first , one can note that our wish to have a symmetric fermionic sector is fulfilled : the black and white sectors form a subalgebra that is an usual grassmann algebra : @xmath48 @xmath49 an important remark is that the only combinations of monochromatic generators that can be included in this grassmann subalgebra are the @xmath50 ( and all similar terms with the three colors in a different order ) , the @xmath51 , the @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , the product of @xmath34 monochromatic generators of the same color , and their products .",
    "any other combination destroys the @xmath1-grading if the colors are maintained on an equal footing .",
    "that is , if we include @xmath55 , we must also include @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which destroys the @xmath58-grading because @xmath59 .",
    "these combinations bear a very strong formal resemblance with the only physically observable combinations of quarks in qcd , especially for @xmath60 .",
    "but where qcd gives a dynamical explanation for the confinement , our model would derive the rules of confinement from algebraical and statistical arguments : a fock space generated by operators obeying our commutation rules would have some states that , because of their colored content , would not be entirely symmetric or antisymmetric and so would be physically unobservable . on the other hand , states containing only black or white combinations of monochromatic generators would have correct symmetry properties with respect to the exchange of the physically observable particles , that is hadrons .",
    "please note that we have not imposed any condition on the gauge theory but only on the grading group .",
    "but because of the assumed symmetry between the three colors , @xmath61 and qcd seem very natural in this framework .",
    "the meson - like combinations of monochromatic generators , the @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , commuting with the rest of the algebra , are _ bosons_. the baryon - like combinations , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , anticommuting with each other , with the white generators @xmath67 and @xmath68 and their odd combinations , are _",
    "fermions_. individually , the monochromatic generators commute with the even sector of the algebra ( that is the bosons ) and anticommute with the odd sector ( that is the fermions ) and so from our black and white world look like fermions , but to each other , they do not act like fermions , but rather like parafermions : @xmath69 @xmath70 with important differences , among which @xmath71 , which indicates that , as fermions , two monochromatic particles would be unable to be in the same state at the same point . from these relations , we easily show that the @xmath72 s obey the ternary rule @xmath73 and not @xmath74 which was the fundamental relation of the generalized grassmann algebras kerner introduced in @xcite .",
    "like one built the supersymmetry generators with the ordinary grassmann algebra , one can build with this tricolor grassmann algebra the generators of a tricolor supersymmetry .",
    "first , let us define the derivation operators on the algebra of tricolor grassmann valued functions from the twisted leibniz rule : @xmath75_{c}=\\delta _ { y}^{x}{\\bf 1}\\ ] ] where , by @xmath76 and @xmath77 we mean any kind of index , colored or not , and by @xmath78 , the multiplication by any generator of the tricolor grassmann algebra , colored or not .",
    "the colored commutator is defined by @xmath79_{c}=ab-\\varepsilon ( g_{a},g_{b})ba\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the grades of @xmath10 and @xmath22 .",
    "the red ( resp .",
    "green , blue ) derivation operators are attributed the red ( resp .",
    "green , blue ) grade @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath80 are black , the @xmath81 have all their colors equal to @xmath19 and the @xmath82 have all their colors equal to @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the derivations on black and white indices obey the usual superleibniz rule .    from these rules",
    ", we can derive for example @xmath83 the colors the derivation operators have been assigned are consistent with the fact that the colored commutator of any pair of derivation operators vanishes .",
    "for example , @xmath84_{c}=\\partial ^{r}\\partial ^{g}-q\\partial ^{g}\\partial ^{r}=0\\ ] ] in other words , the derivations have the _ same _ commutation relations as the corresponding generators .",
    "let us redefine first the usual supersymmetry generators : @xmath85 these operators are exactly identical to the usual supersymmetry generators and have the same properties , in particular @xmath86_{c}=\\{d^{\\alpha } , \\bar{d}^{\\dot{% \\alpha}}\\}=2\\sigma _ { a}^{\\alpha \\dot{\\alpha}}\\partial ^{a}\\ ] ] that is , the supersymmetric translations are `` square roots '' of the translations of the commutative sector . similar , but richer properties can be derived for the tricolor supersymmetry generators : @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 and their conjugates @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 we also define the following alternative operators where the @xmath72 s in the second term of the definition of the @xmath93 operators have been swapped : @xmath94 @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are defined similarly .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath100_{c}]_{c } & = & [ d^{a_{g}},[d^{\\prime a_{b}},d^{a_{r}}]_{c}]_{c}=[d^{a_{b}},[d^{\\prime a_{r}},d^{a_{g}}]_{c}]_{c}= \\\\ & = & ( q-1)\\rho _ { \\alpha } ^{a_{r}a_{g}a_{b}}d^{\\alpha } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similar relations with barred operators .",
    "that is , the monochromatic supersymmetric translations are also _ cubic _ roots of the ordinary _ supersymmetric _ translations .",
    "the algebra generated by the @xmath93 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 operators by means of the colored commutator is finite - dimensional ( if the generalized grassmann algebra is generated by a finite number of generators , of course ) .",
    "in fact , our colored supersymmetric translations generate an @xmath20-lie superalgebra@xcite , where the product is the colored commutator .",
    "to write the commutation relations , we need to define the other elements of the algebra : @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 and the similar operators in other colors , or conjugated .",
