    "in the past two decades , progress in atomic physics , quantum optics , and the nanosciences has propelled quantum many - body theory to meet new challenges .",
    "it is indeed now possible to engineer systems that are concrete realizations of some paradigmatic models , which were once introduced to grasp fundamental properties of more complex materials .",
    "new frontiers thus have to be explored , among which the dynamics of these isolated quantum models far from equilibrium is probably the least well understood and one of the most exciting .",
    "one of the fundamental questions that has to be addressed is how correlations propagate in these systems .",
    "the schrdinger equation allows in principle for correlations between distant points to build up in arbitrary short times @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with relativistic quantum field theories , where physical effects can not propagate faster than the speed of light and causality relations between two points in space - time can exist only if one lies within the light - cone of the other . in a seminal work @xcite ,",
    "lieb and robinson however showed that non - relativistic quantum many - body systems can still exhibit some sort of locality : in generic one - dimensional spin models with finite - range interactions , the propagation of correlations appears to be bounded by an effective light cone , outside which correlations are exponentially suppressed . here",
    "the role of the speed of light is played by a velocity which is an intrinsic property of the many - body hamiltonian .",
    "the existence of so - called lieb ",
    "robinson bounds has many far - reaching implications .",
    "for example , they make it possible to simulate on classical computers the ground state properties as well as the dynamical evolution of such quantum systems @xcite .",
    "they also provide a general link between the presence of a finite spectral gap and the existence of a finite correlation length in the ground state of certain lattice systems @xcite . however , the extent to which lieb ",
    "robinson bounds can be generalized beyond spin systems remains an open question .",
    "proofs or evidence for the existence of such bounds have indeed been reported in various systems , ranging from harmonic chains to the bose ",
    "hubbard model @xcite .",
    "but it is also possible to construct models in which the propagation velocity of correlations is explicitly unbounded @xcite .",
    "dynamical properties of correlations in a closed system can be probed by studying the time evolution following a sudden change of parameter in the hamiltonian , a situation referred to as a _",
    "quantum quench_. the quench has a particular appeal in the context of ultracold gases in optical lattices as the relevant parameters in the hamiltonian governing these systems can be easily varied in time @xcite .",
    "in addition to the existence of an effective light cone , it was discovered in recent theoretical studies that the time evolution of correlations in quenched systems is characterized by a pronounced propagation front @xcite . as for a lieb  robinson bound , the velocity at which this front propagates can involve a broad range of the spectrum of the hamiltonian since the system is far from equilibrium .",
    "this makes the understanding of this feature particularly challenging : covariant low - energy effective theories would provide a natural description @xcite , but , due to the presence of high - energy excitations , realistic lattice models @xcite show a much richer behavior than their corresponding field theories . gaining more insight into the non - equilibrium properties of quantum systems",
    "thus urges the development of new effective models .    in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the propagation of correlations in a quantum many - body system was studied both theoretically and experimentally in a one - dimensional bosonic gas in an optical lattice and a propagation front could be clearly identified .",
    "the observed behavior was interpreted using an exactly solvable effective model derived from the bose ",
    "hubbard hamiltonian and describing non - interacting fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "the key idea behind this model is to use a jordan  wigner transformation to cure some of the problems inherent to the slave - boson methods proposed previously @xcite . in the present article",
    ", we describe this approach in more detail and use it to derive the ground state as well as the quench dynamics in the mott - insulating phase .",
    "we show that its predictions are quantitatively correct in a regime of strong and intermediate interactions .",
    "our model , being exactly solvable , allows us to explore the time evolution of the system at long times , and we can show that the velocity of the propagation front exhibits a generic scaling behavior . using numerical simulations ,",
    "we find that this behavior holds in all interaction regimes , down to the non - interacting limit of free bosons , where explicit solutions are available .",
    "the asymptotic value of the velocity of the propagation front , which strongly differs between the strongly and the weakly interacting limits , can be used to characterize the crossover between these two regimes .",

    "in this work we consider a one - dimensional system of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "if the lattice is deep enough , this system can be described by the one - dimensional single - band bose ",
    "hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the annihilation and creation operators of a bosonic atom at site @xmath3 and @xmath4 counts the number of atoms at that site .",
    "we use a lattice constant @xmath5 and the system is considered to be infinitely large and homogeneous .",
    "the kinetic part of the hamiltonian is characterized by the hopping amplitude @xmath6 ; the on - site interaction strength @xmath7 is related to the @xmath8-wave scattering length .",
    "we work at fixed commensurate filling @xmath9 , where the model exhibits a quantum phase transition between a superfluid phase at low interaction strengths @xmath10 and a mott - insulating phase at large interaction strengths @xmath11 . at the specific filling @xmath12 ,",
    "the critical value is given by @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "hubbard model is non - integrable @xcite and exhibits complex many - body properties ; in particular , its non - equilibrium properties are far from being fully understood .    in order to benchmark the analytical approaches",
    ", we will perform exact numerical simulations of model by means of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , an algorithm based on matrix product states @xcite . while the dmrg algorithm gives",
    "highly accurate results for the ground state , time evolution @xcite can be calculated only for relatively short periods of time .",
    "in the following , we will describe in detail how the bose  hubbard model can be mapped onto an effective model of non - interacting auxiliary fermions .",
    "the procedure consists of four main steps : ( i ) the local hilbert space is reduced to only three states and ( ii ) auxiliary bosonic operators are introduced that allow switching between these states ( sec .",
    "[ sec : auxiliarybosons ] ) ; ( iii ) the auxiliary boson operators are fermionized by a jordan - wigner transformation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fermionization ] ) ; ( iv ) a constraint on the fermionic operators is relaxed so that the effective hamiltonian becomes quadratic and can be diagonalized ( sec .",
    "[ sec : unconstrained ] ) .      in the mott - insulating phase and",
    "away from the critical point , the local density fluctuations around the average filling @xmath14 are limited .",
    "it is thus possible to truncate the local basis on a single site @xmath3 to three states only : @xmath15 , with @xmath16 . within this reduced basis",
    ", one can represent the bare atomic operators @xmath17 in terms of constrained auxiliary boson operators @xmath18 with two flavors @xmath19 : @xmath20 the ` @xmath21'-bosons correspond to excess particles : @xmath22 , and ` @xmath23'-bosons to holes : @xmath24 .",
    "the local fock state @xmath25 represents the vacuum state of the auxiliary particles @xmath26 .",
    "bosonic commutation relations are obeyed : @xmath27 } & = \\delta_{j , j'}\\delta_{\\sigma,\\sigma'}\\,,\\notag\\\\   { [ { b^\\dagger_{j,\\sigma}},{b^\\dagger_{j',\\sigma'}}]}&= { [ { b_{j,\\sigma}},{b_{j',\\sigma ' } } ] } = 0\\,,\\ ] ] which allow for the unphysical situation of single sites being occupied by more than one auxiliary boson .",
    "therefore , the auxiliary operators have to fulfill the hardcore constraint @xmath28 and double occupancies of different species need to be eliminated by imposing @xmath29 this representation in terms of doubly - flavored constrained bosons is slightly different from the one used in slave - particle techniques @xcite , in which one introduces one auxiliary operator for each of the three local states @xmath15 and the number of auxiliary bosons per site is constrained to be exactly one .",
    "it is difficult to ensure the operator constraints and in general , and one often resorts to mean - field @xcite and perturbative @xcite approximations . in the special one - dimensional case , however , it is possible to use jordan  wigner transformations @xcite which allow on the one hand for the exact treatment of the hard - core constraint ( [ eq : constraint1 ] ) and on the other for suppression of local pairing of auxiliary particles .        here",
    ", we follow the standard procedure of jordan and wigner @xcite and introduce auxiliary fermion operators @xmath30 with number operators @xmath31 and anti - commutation relations @xmath32 using non - local string operators , @xmath33 we relate the auxiliary bosonic operators to the fermionic ones : @xmath34 the string operator @xmath35 counts the parity of the number of fermions accumulated over all sites @xmath36 ( including the @xmath21-fermion on site @xmath3 if @xmath37 ) and obeys the relations @xmath38 as a consequence , the number operators within both fermionic and bosonic representations coincide : @xmath39 and the original atom number operator can be written as @xmath40    due to the fermionic statistics , the hard - core conditions ( [ eq : constraint1 ] ) are satisfied automatically . the remaining constraint ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) can be formally accounted for by the global projector @xmath41 , with @xmath42 eliminating states with both species on the same site .",
    "it is now possible to show that , within the truncated hilbert space , the original hamiltonian ( [ eq : bhhamiltonian ] ) can be exactly represented by the following fermionic model : @xmath43 we note that the effective hopping amplitudes for the two different flavors differ by the bosonic enhancement factor of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbmapping ] ) .      in practice , it is difficult to take care analytically of the projector @xmath44",
    ". we will thus carry out the calculations in the approximation of unconstrained fermions ( uf ) , @xmath45 , leading to a quadratic hamiltonian that can be diagonalized exactly .",
    "we will see that the uf approximation is justified because the main source of creation of double occupancies would be a local pairing mechanism , which , in the fermionic representation , is suppressed by the statistics of the auxiliary particles .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hfermionic ] ) with @xmath46 can be rewritten in momentum space as @xmath47 with the bare dispersions    [ eq : baredisp ] @xmath48    and an antisymmetric pairing parameter @xmath49 which obeys @xmath50 . in analogy to the gutzwiller approximation @xcite , the accuracy of the uf approximation can be estimated _ via _ the translation - invariant expectation value of the local projector @xmath51 this quantity is a measure for the population of unphysical states and gives the order of magnitude of the error in local observables ( due to translational invariance site indices of observables can be dropped ) .",
    "additionally , we will study the quality of the relaxation of the constraint ( [ eq : constraint2 ] ) by comparison to the numerically exact dmrg method .",
    "the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath52 can be diagonalized via a bogolyubov transformation by introducing the quasiparticle operators    [ eq : btransf ] @xmath53    the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 fulfill the relations    @xmath56    and are determined by the following expressions :    [ eq : btrans ] @xmath57    we infer from the above equations that the @xmath21modes are excess particles each dressed with absent holes and the @xmath23modes are holes dressed with absent excess particles .",
    "this is particularly evident from the perturbative expressions ( [ eq : upert ] ) and ( [ eq : vpert ] ) .",
    "we also note that the quasiparticle operators ( [ eq : btransf ] ) can be interpreted as dirac spinors @xcite .    using the quasiparticle operators ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be written in the diagonal form @xmath58 the dispersion relation of the individual quasiparticles is @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the energy of a pair of two distinct types of quasiparticles with opposite momenta , which is given by    @xmath61 ^ 2 + 4|\\delta(\\k)|^2}\\label{eq : dispomega }      \\\\      & = u-2j(2\\nnot+1)\\cos(\\k)+\\mathcal{o}\\left(\\frac{j^2}{u}\\right)\\,.\\label{eq : disppert }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the exact dispersion relations for different interaction strengths are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] , together with the first order expansion in @xmath62 ( strong coupling expansion ) .",
    "one can see that the profiles rapidly differ from their limiting cosine shape as the interactions are lowered .",
    "eqs .   and",
    "show that the width of the energy bands depends only on the hopping amplitude @xmath6 and on the average filling @xmath63 ( _ via _ the bose enhancement factor ) , but does not depend on the interaction strength . at large interaction strengths , the energy gap is proportional to the interaction strength and the gap of the ` @xmath21'-quasiparticles is strictly positive when the interaction is above a certain threshold : @xmath64 below this threshold our uf approximation breaks down . for @xmath65 , the range of validity of our model",
    "is thus limited to @xmath66 , which is above the superfluid to mott - insulator transition @xmath67 , but significantly lower than the mean - field transition @xmath68 .",
    "a description of the phase transition might be achieved by introducing auxiliary operators on the basis of a coherent - state representation ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but this goes beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the slope of the dispersion relations @xmath69 describes the group velocity of the quasiparticles .",
    "of particular interest will be the relative velocity of pairs of quasiparticles of distinct types and opposite momenta : @xmath70 whose maximal value @xmath71 plays an important role in the characterization of the non - equilibrium properties .",
    "this maximal velocity corresponds to the point where the curvature of @xmath72 changes sign .",
    "it is located at @xmath73 at large interaction strengths and is shifted toward lower momenta at smaller interaction strengths , as can be seen in fig  [ fig : disp ] . in the relevant interaction regime ( [ eq : regime ] ) , the maximum velocity is well approximated by : @xmath74 in particular , one sees that @xmath75 is a decreasing function of @xmath76 .    for the strictly positive quasiparticle energies ( [ eq : regime ] ) ,",
    "the ground state at a value of @xmath7 and @xmath6 is the quasiparticle vacuum    [ eq : gswavefunction ] @xmath77    the ground state at infinitely strong interactions , i.e. the fock state with @xmath14 particles per site , @xmath78 , represents the vacuum of the bare excess particles and holes .",
    "we summarize in this sec .",
    "some general properties of the correlation functions in the quasiparticle formalism that will be used later to derive ground state and non - equilibrium properties of the system .    for the ground state ( [ eq : gswavefunction ] ) , but also for the time - dependent wave functions ( [ eq : timeevolution ] ) which will be introduced in section [ sec : timeevolution ] , the only non - vanishing single - particle correlation functions are    [ eq : corrft ] @xmath79    where @xmath80 and the thermodynamic limit has been taken .",
    "possible time dependence ( equal time ) is implicit and expectation values are site - independent for the homogeneous systems under consideration . we note that the correlations of the different types are equivalent : @xmath81 therefore , also the quasiparticle densities do not depend on the flavor and we can define a single density of excitations : @xmath82 since the hamiltonian is quadratic , correlations of the occupancies can be related to the single - particle correlations using wick s theorem , which gives us @xmath83 in the special case @xmath84 , the fermionic statistics , together with the symmetry with respect to exchange of fermionic flavor , imply that the on - site correlator @xmath85 vanishes and the local double occupancy factorizes : @xmath86 the density of excitations thus fully determines all local properties , including the atom number fluctuations : @xmath87    atom correlations can be related to correlations of auxiliary particles . making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fermionstoatoms ] ) , we can for example express atomic density correlations in the following way : @xmath88 ultracold atom experiments with single - site resolved imaging @xcite can access the parity @xmath89 rather than the density itself .",
    "the expression for parity correlations turns out to be similar to that of density correlations : @xmath90 both density and parity correlations are particularly simple to evaluate within the present approach .",
    "correlations including the non - local string operator ( [ eq : string ] ) , such as the single - particle correlations @xmath91 , can also be computed , but they require the evaluation of the toeplitz determinant @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the fermionic string ( [ eq : string ] ) is equivalent to the string operator recently measured by endres @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss the equilibrium properties of the mott - insulating phase derived within the unconstrained fermion approximation .",
    "as argued in the preceding section , the observables are related to single - particle correlations ( [ eq : corrft ] ) , which for the ground state ( [ eq : gswavefunction ] ) can be evaluated straightforwardly : @xmath92 with the coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 given in eq .",

    "the predictions of the uf approximation , both from the numerical integration of ( [ eq : gsnex ] ) and from the strong coupling expansion , are in excellent agreement with the dmrg simulations for all interaction strengths satisfying ( [ eq : regime ] ) .",
    "the accuracy of the truncation of the local hilbert space to three states only is also confirmed by the dmrg simulations .",
    "higher occupancies start to be important only for interaction strengths below the point where the uf approximation breaks down .",
    "we further compare our results with the ones derived within a holstein ",
    "primakov approximation of the slave - boson representation used , e.g. , by huber  @xcite .",
    "this approach is equivalent to the auxiliary boson representation ( [ eq : sbmapping ] ) when fully relaxing the constraints ( [ eq : constraint1],[eq : constraint2 ] ) .",

    "<S> we identify a pronounced propagation front , the velocity of which , once correctly extrapolated at large distances , can serve as a quantitative characteristic of the many - body hamiltonian . in particular , the velocity allows the weakly interacting regime , which is qualitatively well described by free bosons , to be distinguished from the strongly interacting one , in which pairs of distinct quasiparticles dominate the dynamics . in order to describe the latter case analytically </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a general approximation to solve the bose  hubbard hamiltonian based on the jordan  wigner fermionization of auxiliary particles . </S>",
    "<S> this approach can also be used to determine the ground - state properties . as a complement to the fermionization approach , </S>",
    "<S> we derive explicitly the time - dependent many - body state in the non - interacting limit and compare our results to numerical simulations in the whole range of interactions of the bose  hubbard model . </S>"
