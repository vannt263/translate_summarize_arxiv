    "in the collision of an energetic particle @xmath1=@xmath2 with @xmath3 medium particles , how dense must the medium be for the multiple collisions to become a single coherent ( 1+@xmath3)-body collision , instead of a sequence of @xmath3 incoherent 2-body collisions ?",
    "it is instructive to find out the conditions on the medium density and the energy of the incident particle that determine whether the set of multiple collisions are coherent or incoherent @xcite .",
    "for such a purpose , we consider a binary collision between the incident fast particle @xmath1 and a medium scatterer @xmath4 with the exchange of a boson , in the medium center - of - momentum frame .",
    "the longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath5 for the binary collision can be obtained from the transverse momentum transfer @xmath6 by @xmath7 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum transfer is associated with a longitudinal coherence length @xmath8 that specifies the uncertainties in the longitudinal locations at which the virtual boson is exchanged between the fast particle and the scatterer .",
    "the nature of the multiple scattering process can be inferred by comparing the longitudinal coherence length @xmath9 with the mean free path @xmath10 of the jet in the dense medium that depends not only on the density of the medium but also on the binary collision cross section . if @xmath11 , then a single binary collision is well completed before another binary collision begins , and the multiple collision process consists of a sequence of @xmath3 incoherent two - body collisions .    if @xmath12 , then a single binary collision is not completed before another one begins , and the multiple collision process consists of a set of coherent collisions as a single ( 1+@xmath3)-body collision . for a set of initial and final states in such a coherent ( 1+@xmath3)-body collision ,",
    "there are @xmath13 different trajectories in the sequence of collisions along @xmath9 at which various virtual bosons are exchanged . by bose - einstein symmetry , the total feynman amplitude is then the sum of the amplitudes for all possible interchanges of the exchanged virtual bosons .",
    "the summation of these feynman amplitudes and the accompanying interference constitute the bose - einstein interference in the passage of the fast particle in the dense medium .",
    "there is another important effect that accompanies the coherent ( 1+@xmath3)-body collision and changes the nature of the collision process .",
    "a sequence of @xmath3 incoherent two - body collisions contains only @xmath14 degrees of freedom , which can be chosen to be the transverse momentum transfers @xmath15 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath5 after each individual jet - parton collision is then a dependent variable , depending on the corresponding transverse momentum transfer as @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , the coherent ( 1+@xmath3)-body collision links the incident particle with @xmath3 scatterers as a single collisional unit .",
    "there are @xmath17 degrees of freedom in this coherent ( 1+@xmath3)-body collision , after the @xmath18 degrees of freedom are reduced by the constraints of the conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "the set of longitudinal momentum transfers , @xmath19 , can also be independent variables with their own probability distribution functions .",
    "the longitudinal momentum of the incident fast particle can flow to the @xmath3 scatterers , which can then carry a substantial fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the incident fast particle .",
    "thus , the degrees of freedom increases from @xmath14 for incoherent collisions to @xmath17 for a coherent collision , and this increase changes the character of the collision process .",
    "it is of interest to inquire whether there are fast particles energetic enough , scatterer media dense enough , and binary cross section large enough , for coherent collisions to occur . in high energy central collisions between heavy nuclei such as those at rhic and lhc , both jets ( mini - jets ) and a dense medium",
    "are produced after each collision .",
    "the jets will collide with partons in the dense medium , and these collisions may satisfy the condition for coherent collisions .",
    "the longitudinal coherent length @xmath9 is of order 25 fm , for a typical transverse momentum transfer of @xmath6@xmath200.4 gev / c from a jet of momentum @xmath21@xmath2010 gev / c to a medium parton in a binary collision at rhic @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal coherent length @xmath9 is much greater than the radius @xmath22 of a large nucleus . on the other hand ,",
    "the away side jet is quenched by the dense medium in the most central auau collisions at rhic and lhc @xcite , and the near - side jet collides with about 4 - 6 medium partons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , one can infer that the mean - free path @xmath10 for the collision of the jet with medium partons is much smaller than the nuclear radius @xmath22 .",
    "hence , @xmath23 in high - energy central nuclear collisions at rhic and lhc , and the multiple collision process of a jet with medium partons along its path constitutes a set of coherent collision .",
    "as an example of the interference of feynman amplitudes in a coherent collision , we consider @xmath24 the collisions of an energetic fermion @xmath1 with two fermion scatterers @xmath25 and @xmath26 of rest mass @xmath27 in the abelian gauge theory .

    "on the other hand , if the collision process is characterized by @xmath32 , it comprises a set of coherent ( 1 + 2)-body collision .",
    "there is an additional feynman amplitude @xmath33 for diagram 1(b ) , obtained by making a symmetrized permutation of the bosons in diagram 1(a ) , @xmath34 the trajectories for diagram 1(a ) and 1(b ) are both possible paths in a coherent collision , leading from the a set of initial states to a set of final states . by bose - einstein symmetry , the total amplitude @xmath35 for coherent collisions is the symmetrized sum of @xmath36 and @xmath33 .",
    "we consider the high - energy limit and assume the conservation of helicity with @xmath37 in this limit , we have approximately @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a small positive quantity .",
    "we shall be interested in the case in which the fermion @xmath40 after the collision remains on the mass shell .",
    "the mass shell condition can be expressed as @xmath41 the symmetrized sum of the feynman amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath33 in the high - energy limit is @xmath42 note that the amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath33 correlate with each other because of the mass - shell condition ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "the real parts of the amplitudes destructively cancel , and the imaginary parts interfere and add constructively , to result in sharp distributions at @xmath43 @xmath20 0 and @xmath44 @xmath20 0 , @xmath45 where the function @xmath46 approaches the dirac delta function @xmath47 in the limit @xmath48 .",
    "generalizing to the case of the coherent collision of a fast fermion with @xmath3 fermion scatterers , the total feynman amplitude is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the sum of @xmath13 amplitudes involving symmetric permutations of the exchanged bosons given by @xmath51 the above sum involves extensive cancellations .",
    "remarkably , it can be shown that this sum of @xmath13 permutations turns out to be a product of sharp distributions centered at @xmath52 @xcite , @xmath53 which indicates that in coherent collisions , there is a destructive interference of the feynman amplitudes in most regions of the phase space but a constructive interference in some other regions of the the phase space , leading to sharp distributions at @xmath52 .",
