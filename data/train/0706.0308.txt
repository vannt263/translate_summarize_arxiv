    "the ray tracing has demonstrated that early parts of the time - fronts , _",
    "i.e. _ ray arrivals in time - depth plane , exhibit surprisingly regular structures simultaneously with sensitivity to the media inhomogeneities that give rise to ray chaos @xcite . even at very long ranges ,",
    "up to a few thousand km , steep chaotic rays can form remarkably stable segments of the time - front , which are very close to their prototypes in the unperturbed waveguide .",
    "it turns out that each stable segment in the perturbed waveguide , like its counterpart in the unperturbed one , is formed by rays with equal identifiers , _ i.e. _ the number of ray semi  cycles .",
    "this phenomenon can be observed in the travel times of the so - called eigenrays , i.e. rays passing through a fixed observation point . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) it has been demonstrated that the travel times of chaotic eigenrays usually come in clusters with small time spreads centered at arrivals of unperturbed eigenrays .",
    "although the rays that form a cluster have the same identifier , i.e. the same topology , this does not imply that their trajectories follow close paths .",
    "on the contrary , chaotic eigenrays contributing to the given cluster may significantly deviate from each other and from the unperturbed eigenray with the same identifier @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that while the travel time of chaotic rays is a random function of starting parameters , it is much more predictable as a function of its identifier and the trajectory endpoints , and it also relates to the dependence of the travel time @xmath0 on the starting momentum @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "interesting , even puzzling features , when observed numerically , reveal a step - like behavior of @xmath0 as a function of the initial momentum that forms the so - called `` shelves '' for ray propagation in a range - independent waveguide . in the case when rays propagate in a range - dependent waveguide",
    "so - called , ray chaos takes place , and an important characteristic is a ray travel time distribution , which exhibits fairly inhomogeneous features with obvious maxima @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study analytically the dependence of the travel time on the initial conditions in the framework of an exact solvable model .",
    "we consider ray propagation in a waveguide with the sound speed profile which corresponds to the dynamics of a quartic oscillator .",
    "therefore , studying this model , we explain the step - like behavior of the travel time @xmath0 as a function of the starting momentum @xmath1 ( related to the starting ray grazing angle @xmath2 by @xmath3 ) . for the case when ray chaos takes place due to a range dependent perturbation",
    ", we also explain the inhomogeneity of the ray travel time distribution which has obvious maxima .",
    "these maxima lead to the clustering of rays , and each maximum can be related to the corresponding identifier of the cluster of rays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we give a brief description of ray theory in the small  angle approximation .",
    "explicit expressions for the hamiltonian determining the ray motion and for the ray travel time are presented .",
    "an overview of the numerical results on the ray travel time , obtained in @xcite , will be presented and explained in the present paper . an exact solution for a simplified speed profile corresponding to the quartic oscillator",
    "is considered in sec .",
    "3 . an exact expression for the corresponding classical action as a function of the initial conditions is presented .",
    "a detailed analytical analysis of the step - like functional dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 is performed as well . in sec .",
    "4 the maxima of the distribution function for the ray travel time are found for the integrable quartic oscillator in the presence of a perturbation .",

    "present @xmath12 as @xmath22 and substitute this expression into eq .",
    "( [ heq ] ) . taking into account that @xmath23 is a slowly  varying function of @xmath24 and neglecting the second derivative of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath6",
    ", we derive the parabolic equation @xmath25 this equation coincides formally with the time - dependent schrdinger equation . in this case",
    "the partial derivative with respect to @xmath26 is an analog of the momentum operator , _",

    "such rays are called the eigenrays**. * * here @xmath43 is the eikonal analog to classical action or the hamilton principal function in mechanics  of the @xmath44-th eigenray .",

    "the amplitude @xmath47 is given by @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a function determined by the time - dependence of the radiated signal , and the derivative @xmath50 is taken at the range @xmath6 .",

    "( [ uv ] ) and ( [ vtild ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ swu ] ) yields @xmath51 each term in this sum represents a sound pulse coming to the observation point through a particular eigenray .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 determines a delay of the pulse relative to an initially radiated signal and it is called the ray travel time .      studying the general properties of ray travel times in acoustic waveguides",
    "is equivalent to studying the properties of the principal hamiltonian function @xmath53 of a mechanical particle oscillating in a potential well .",
    "recently the properties of @xmath54 have been numerically studied in @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this result as svz .",
    "the main numerical results important for the present analysis are shown in figs . 1 and 2 , which were taken from svz . both figures present the travel time dependence on the starting momentum @xmath1 .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates dependencies of the ray travel time @xmath55 on the starting momentum @xmath56 for two waveguides with different sound speed profiles , i.e. for two `` potentials '' @xmath57 : @xmath58 all six curves shown in fig . 1 present the travel times at a range of 150 km , and each curve corresponds to a particular source depth . even though the `` potentials '' @xmath59 and @xmath60 are quite different , both dependencies @xmath61 , shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 , have an important common feature : each curve has `` shelves '' where its inclinations with respect to the horizontal are small . at intervals of starting momenta corresponding to the `` shelves '' ,",
    "the ray travel time @xmath55 is most stable ( least sensitive ) with respect to small variations in @xmath56 .",
    "the same features occur for the so - called canonical sound speed profile or the munk profile @xmath62 , widely used in underwater acoustics to model wave transmission through a deep ocean @xcite .",
    "the dependencies @xmath61 are shown in fig .",
    "2 which presents the ray travel times , @xmath55 , as a function of the starting momentum , @xmath56 , at range of 2500 km for a point source located at 1 km depth . a thick solid line graphs the @xmath61 for the regular ray in the aforementioned range - independent waveguide .",
    "randomly scattered points correspond to chaotic rays in the presence of perturbation : @xmath63 .",
    "the density of these points has maxima forming dark horizontal stripes , as is shown in fig .",
    "it should be pointed out that , while the background profile @xmath64 is realistic , the perturbation @xmath65 has been chosen in svz to present only a strongly idealized model of internal - wave - induced sound speed variations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this perturbation causes a chaotic ray behavior whose properties closely resemble that observed in more realistic numerical models @xcite . ray travel times in the unperturbed waveguide ( @xmath66 )",
    "presented in fig.2 ( thick solid line ) have the same properties typical of range - independent waveguides , namely `` shelves '' , which are similar to those presented in fig .",
    "moreover , for the chaotic rays , the stripes of the scattered points are located at travel times close to that of the `` shelves '' on the unperturbed @xmath61 curves .",
    "note that the unperturbed `` shelves '' may be interpreted as parts of the @xmath61 curve with the highest density of points depicting unperturbed arrivals .",
    "it has been stated in svz that , under conditions of ray chaos , the positions of maxima of the density of ray travel times remain relatively stable .",
    "so , these figures express the main puzzling results of the generic features of `` shelves '' , and our main task in the present work is to explain them .",
    "as was mentioned above , the general properties of the ray travel time @xmath0 can be described by the action @xmath54 of a mechanical particle in a potential well .",
    "therefore , the generic features of `` shelves '' for an unperturbed ray can be explained in the framework of an analytical description of the hamiltonian principal function or the classical action @xmath54 ( [ s ] ) for an integrable system with some potential @xmath32 ( [ u ] ) .",
    "below we consider the oscillating dynamics of a particle in the potential @xmath59 of ( [ u1 ] ) .      as the momentum @xmath67 is a dimensionless variable , it is convenient to consider the potential in the dimensionless variables as well .",
    "namely we consider @xmath68 and @xmath69 , while @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the dynamical equation for a particle in the potential @xmath59 ( also called a quartic oscillator ) in the new notation is @xmath71 following to svz we take a mass @xmath72 .",
    "we also use here , formally , the notation @xmath73 , _ i.e. _ the range @xmath24 plays the same role as a formal time in hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "this equation can be solved exactly .",
    "the solution is chosen in the form of the jacobian elliptic function @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are an amplitude and an initial phase of oscillations correspondingly .",
    "the frequency of the nonlinear oscillations is @xmath77 and the modulus of the elliptic functions is @xmath78 these values are obtained by the straightforward substitution of the solution ( [ sol1 ] ) into ( [ newteq ] ) .",
    "following @xcite we take the modulus @xmath79 and the initial phase @xmath76 to be constants of integration . in this case , the solution ( [ sol1 ] ) is @xmath80^{1/2 } { \\mbox{\\rm cn}\\,}\\left[\\frac{\\omega r}{\\sqrt{1 - 2\\kappa^2}}+\\phi_0,\\kappa\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath76 are associated with the initial coordinate @xmath81 and momentum @xmath1 as @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 are also jacobian elliptic functions .",

    "the modulus is restricted by @xmath91 , and the relations between the constants of integration and the initial conditions are expressed by the single  valued functions .    inserting ( [ sol2 ] ) in ( [ s ] ) , and using the integrals ( 312.02 ) , ( 312.04 ) , ( 361.02 ) of the ref . @xcite and",

    ", we obtain approximately that @xmath101 inserting([aa1 ] ) in ( [ act1 ] ) , and then combining the first two terms , we obtain , after doing small algebra , the following expression for the action @xmath102,\\ ] ] where the nonlinear frequency is now @xmath103 .",
    "it also follows in this approximation that the relation ( [ rel ] ) between the initial momentum @xmath1 and the modulus @xmath79 is simplified @xmath104 where @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "the dependence of ray travel times on the initial momentum @xmath107 in svz coincides up to some constant multiplier with the dependence of the action on the modulus @xmath108 in ( [ act2 ] ) .",
    "_ `` shelves . ''",
    "_ it follows that the action in the form ( [ act2 ] ) consists of two terms .",
    "the first one is the dominant ( proportional to @xmath109 ) monotonic growing function in @xmath79 .",
    "the second one is the small but fast oscillating term with a large frequency ( proportional to @xmath110 ) .",
    "such a combination of these two terms ensures the monotonic growth of the function in general , but at the same time the extrema equation @xmath111 has solutions .",
    "these solutions can be simply obtained , _",
    "e.g. _ for @xmath112 .",
    "the extremum points condition gives , in the same limit @xmath110 , the following solutions for @xmath79 @xmath113 where @xmath114 are integer numbers and @xmath115 means neglected terms of the order of @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , there are regions between extrema points @xmath117 with the same number @xmath118 where the derivatives are negative , @xmath119 .",
    "it follows that , in a range of @xmath120 , the action @xmath54 decreases by @xmath121 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "these regions alternate with regions of growth , where @xmath122 . between extremum points @xmath123 on the range of @xmath124 the action changes as @xmath125 therefore",
    "the growth of the action is stronger ( by 9 times ) than the decrease that leads to the step - like behavior of the action as a function of @xmath79 . this step  like function ( see figs .",
    "1 and 3 ) has horizontal parts called `` shelves '' in @xcite .",
    "an important feature of `` shelves '' is a large number of fourier components in the fourier transformation of the oscillating term in ( [ act2 ] ) ( see appendix b ) .",
    "it is shown in appendix c that the average number of `` harmonics '' of the fourier transformation is @xmath126 one can see , in the insert of fig .",
    "3 , a large number of the fourier amplitudes .",
    "in contrast to the regular dynamics , the arrival times of chaotic rays are not uniquely defined functions of the initial conditions , which is a simple result of the energy @xmath127 ( [ ham ] ) or the modulus @xmath79 being no more the integrals of motion in the chaotic case .",
    "this means that many initial conditions can contribute to the same arrival time ( as it is seen in fig .",
    "wave dynamics leads to the wave superposition with different probabilities for different arrival times .",
    "obvious maxima of the travel times distribution are seen in fig .",
    "2 . to explain this phenomenon",
    ", we will use the analytical solution for the unperturbed ray dynamics , while chaotic dynamics is modeled by a randomization of the initial phase @xmath76 or by a variety of different sources with random phases @xmath76 uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath128 .",
    "_ an integrable case .",
    "_ the probability of finding a particle with the range @xmath24 and the depth @xmath26 is defined by a solution of the parabolic equation ( [ scheq ] ) with an amplitude ( [ a ] ) .",
    "therefore these amplitudes define the probability distribution for different @xmath108 with the same fixed @xmath24 by ( [ a ] ) @xmath129 in ( [ sol2 ] ) and the relation @xmath130 in ( [ rel2 ] ) , we obtain in the small@xmath79approximation @xmath131/\\sin(2\\phi_0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath110 , the main contribution to the derivative ( [ dzdp0 ] ) is due to the linear term @xmath132 .",
    "therefore the evaluation of the probability for the asymptotically large times is @xmath133 the maxima of this probability correspond to zeroes of the denominator , which can be found from the following equation @xmath134 for the fixed @xmath135 and @xmath76 , the solutions of ( [ kapn ] ) @xmath136 determine the actions @xmath137 where the maxima of probability take place for the integrable case .",
    "_ ray chaos .",
    "_ for the chaotic case the energy @xmath127 or the modulus @xmath79 are no longer the integrals of motion . therefore the rays with different initial conditions @xmath138 can contribute to the same arrival time @xmath54 with different probabilities . in our phenomenological approach ,",
    "it is convenient , as was mentioned above , to model the chaotic dynamics by a variety of initial conditions with random phases @xmath76 uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath128 .",
    "therefore the averaged probability is a superposition of probabilities with all initial phases .",
    "it reads @xmath139\\right),\\ ] ] where the signs @xmath140 are due to the modulus function in ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ meana ] ) , and @xmath141 sign stands for @xmath142 , while @xmath143 sign is taken for @xmath144 .",
    "the maxima of the mean probability are @xmath145 that coincides with ( [ kapn ] ) for @xmath112 .",
    "it follows from ( [ kapn ] ) and ( [ meana ] ) that rays with different @xmath79 are clustered by the index @xmath146 numbering the maxima",
    ". for all values of @xmath76 one always finds a value of @xmath79 which corresponds to the maxima conditions with the same @xmath146 .",
    "it also follows that all other values of @xmath79 which do not correspond to the maxima conditions `` carry '' the same index @xmath146 if their action @xmath54 is close to the maximum value @xmath147 .",
    "this phenomenon of the ray clustering can be a possible explanation of the _ i d number _ for rays @xcite .",
    "it should be admitted that in the framework of this simple analysis of the solution of the quartic oscillator , we are able to describe fairly well the step  like behaviour of the arrival paths as a function of the initial momentum .",
    "this step  like behaviour is known as `` shelves '' @xcite .    for the chaotic behaviour of rays",
    ", we constructed a phenomenological model and presented only qualitative explanations of the nonuniform distribution of the arrival paths as a function of the initial momentum .",
    "the maxima of this distribution are explained in the framework of the integrable model .",
