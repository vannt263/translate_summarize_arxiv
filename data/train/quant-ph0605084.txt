    "laser theory is a major branch of quantum optics and there are many textbooks devoted to that matter or that pay a special attention to it ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in spite of this",
    "we do think that there is room for new didactic presentations of the basic semiclassical laser theory equations as some aspects are not properly covered in the standard didactic material or are scattered in specialized sources .",
    "the most clear example concerns the uniform field limit approximation @xcite , which is usually assumed _ ab initio _ without discussion , and when discussed , as e.g. in @xcite , it is done in a way that admits relevant simplifications .",
    "in fact , this important approximation has found a correct form only recently @xcite .",
    "other important aspect that is usually missed in textbooks is the applicability of the standard two ",
    "level approximation to the more realistic three and four  level schemes .",
    "certainly this matter is discussed in some detail in @xcite but we find it important to insist on this as it is usually missed and may lead to some misconceptions , as we discuss below .",
    "there are many good general textbooks on the fundamentals of lasers , e.g. @xcite , and we refer the reader to any of them for getting an overview on the general characteristics of the different laser types . here",
    "it will suffice to say a few words on the structure of the laser .",
    "a typical laser consists of three basic elements : an optical cavity , an amplifying medium , and a pumping mechanism , see fig .",
    "1 . the optical cavity ( also named resonator or oscillator ) consists of two or more mirrors that force light to propagate in a closed circuit , further imposing it a certain modal structure .",
    "there are two basic types of optical cavities , namely ring and linear , that differ in the boundary condition that the cavity mirrors impose to the intracavity field . in ring resonators",
    "the field inside the cavity can be described as a traveling wave .",
    "contrarily , in linear ( also named fabry  perot  type ) resonators , the field is better described as a standing wave , which requires a more complicated mathematical description than the traveling wave case .",
    "the amplifying medium can be solid , liquid , gas , or plasma .",
    "nevertheless , most cases are well described by considering that the amplifying medium consists of a number of atoms , ions or molecules of which a number of states ( energy levels ) , with suitable relaxation rates and dipolar momenta , are involved in the interaction with the electromagnetic field .",
    "it is customary to adopt the so  called two ",
    "level approximation , i.e. , to assume that only two energy levels of the amplifying medium are relevant for the interaction .",
    "actually a minimum of three or four levels are necessary in order to obtain population inversion , and we discuss below how the two  level theory applies to these more complicated level schemes .",
    "then there is the pumping mechanism .",
    "this is highly specific for each laser type but it has always the same purpose : creating enough population inversion for laser action . when modeling radiation ",
    "matter interaction inside the laser cavity one can usually forget the specifics of the pumping mechanism ( whether it is an electric current or a broadband optical discharge or whatever ) and describe it through a suitable pumping parameter . in this point , the consideration of two , three or four  level atomic schemes turns out to be important , as it is here where the pumping mechanism affects the mathematical description as we show below .",
    "laser physics studies all of these aspects of lasers but here we shall not deal but with the mathematical description of the interaction between light and matter inside the laser cavity . in this article we shall provide a systematic derivation of the semiclassical laser equations for an important and simple case :  the homogeneously broadened ring laser , which plays the role of a paradigm in laser physics",
    ". we shall not consider the important issues of inhomogeneous broadening or linear optical resonators , because we want to maintain the derivation as simple as possible ( but not more ! ) .",
    "as stated , we shall use semiclassical theory , i.e. , we shall consider a classical electromagnetic field in interaction with a quantized medium .",
    "the quantization of the medium is necessary in order to correctly describe absorption and amplification as the classical theory ( that models matter as a collection of forced and damped harmonic oscillators ) can not be used for that . with respect to the quantization of the field ,",
    "it is not necessary if one ( i ) is not interested in the field fluctuations , and ( ii ) accepts a heuristic description of relaxation phenomena ( in particular of spontaneous emission ) . in any case",
    ", the quantum theory of the laser requires the use of complicated mathematical techniques and falls outside the scope of our interests here .    after this introduction the rest of the article",
    "is organized as follows : in section ii we derive the field equation ; in section iii we derive the matter equations for two , three , and four  level atoms or molecules ; and in section iv we connect these with the field equation and write down the maxwell  bloch equations .",
    "then sections v and vi are devoted to the analysis of amplification and lasing , respectively .",
    "in section vii we present a clear derivation of the uniform field equations , and in section viii we present the `` lorenz '' from of the laser equations .",
    "finally , in section ix we present our conclusions .",
    "maxwell s equations for a nonmagnetic material without free charges yield the wave equation @xmath0 along this article we shall assume that the electric field @xmath1 is a plane wave propagating along the @xmath2 axis , and write it in the form@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the unit polarization vector ( fixed polarization is assumed ) , and@xmath5 we note that @xmath6 is an arbitrary reference ( carrier ) frequency .",
    "for instance , if light is perfectly monochromatic of frequency @xmath7 we can still choose @xmath8 as we allow the complex amplitude @xmath9 to be time and space dependent .",
    "the situation is even clearer when dealing with light whose spectrum has some finite width : in this case even the concept of `` light frequency '' is ill - defined , and clearly @xmath6 can be chosen arbitrarily .    given the form ( [ e ] ) for the electric field , by consistency with the wave equation , the polarization @xmath10 must read@xmath11    now one must substitute these expressions into the wave equation and perform the _ slowly varying envelope approximation _ ( svea ) that consists in assuming that@xmath12 for @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the physical meaning of this important approximation is clear : one considers that temporal ( spatial ) variations of the amplitudes @xmath15 contain temporal ( spatial ) frequencies that are much smaller than the carrier frequency ( wavenumber ) . in other words : the amplitudes @xmath15 are assumed to vary on time ( space ) scales much slower ( longer ) than the optical frequency ( wavelength ) .",
    "obviously this approximation excludes the ( limit ) case of ultrashort pulses containing only a few cycles of the field , but it is overall very accurate in general , even for short pulses as soon as a sufficient number of cycles enter within the pulse width .    after performing the svea and multiplying the resulting equation by @xmath16 , one readily obtains@xmath17 which is the field equation of interest",
    "let us remark that the svea is a fundamental approximation in laser theory as it allows to transform the original wave equation , which is a second - order partial differential equation ( pde ) , into a first - order pde .",
    "now we need to calculate the source term @xmath14 and we do this in the next section .",
    "the wave equation ( [ maxe ] ) relates the slowly varying electric field amplitude @xmath18 with its source , the slowly varying polarization amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "we discuss in this section how this last quantity is determined .",
    "first we introduce the two  level atom model and derive the evolution equation for its density matrix , the so - called optical bloch equations .",
    "next , the density matrix is shown to yield the information necessary for computing @xmath14 what allows to write a closed set of equations describing the coupled evolution of field and matter , the maxwell  bloch equations .",
    "then we consider the case of three and four  level atoms , which is a more realistic approximation to actual lasers . after deriving their corresponding bloch equations",
    ", we discuss the conditions under which the two  level model can be applied to three and four  level atoms .",
    "in particular this is a necessary step for correctly understand the meaning of the pump parameter .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system consists of two pieces : one describing the atom or molecule in the absence of electromagnetic interaction , and the other describing the action of the electromagnetic field on this atom , i.e.@xmath19    the material medium is assumed to be a system of identical two  level atoms or molecules , i.e. , it is assumed that the material medium is homogeneously broadened .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 and @xmath21 the lower and higher energy levels , respectively , and by @xmath22 the transition frequency of one of these atoms .",
    "this means that the atomic hamiltonian @xmath23 verifies @xmath24 where we have chosen the arbitrary ( and unimportant ) energy origin in such a way that it lies halfway between both states energies ( see , fig .",
    "the matrix representation for this hamiltonian thus reads@xmath25 where the level ordering has been chosen to be @xmath26 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath27 is taken in the electric dipole approximation . roughly speaking ,",
    "this approximation is valid when the light wavelength is much longer than the typical dimensions of the electronic cloud , which is on the order of @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "thus the approximation is justified in the infrared and visible parts of the spectrum and even in the ultraviolet .",
    "this interaction hamiltonian reads@xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the position of the atom ( which is not quantized in the theory ) and the operator @xmath32 , being @xmath33 the electron charge and @xmath34 the vector position operator of the electron relative to the point - like nucleus . @xmath35 acts on the atomic variables whereas in this semiclassical formalism the field @xmath1 is a -number . in the chosen basis ordering the matrix form for this hamiltonian reads@xmath36 where the matrix elements@xmath37 and @xmath38 is the wavefunction ( in position representation ) of the atomic state @xmath39 .",
    "( note that @xmath40 . )",
    "we now recall the parity property of atomic eigenstates : all atomic eigenstates have well defined parity ( even or odd ) due to the central character of the atomic potential .",
    "this means that @xmath41 and then , in order to have interaction , we must consider states @xmath20 and @xmath42 with opposite parity ( this is the basic selection rule of atomic transitions in the electric dipole approximation ) .",
    "hence the interaction hamiltonian ( [ hint1 ] ) becomes@xmath43 where we have introduced the notation@xmath44 taking into account the form of the electric field , eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) , @xmath45 becomes@xmath46 where we have defined@xmath47 we note that @xmath48 is usually referred to as the ( complex ) rabi frequency of the light field .",

    "( [ ham ] ) , for a two  level atom located at position @xmath31 interacting with a light field reads@xmath50      the hamiltonian @xmath49 can serve us to write down the schrdinger equation for the atomic wavefunction .",
    "instead , we use here the density matrix formalism as it is the most appropriate in order to incorporate damping and pumping terms into the equations of motion , something we shall do in the next subsection . in the chosen basis ordering ,",
    "the density matrix @xmath51 representing a two  level atom located at @xmath31 takes the form@xmath52    the meaning of the matrix elements is as follows : @xmath53 denotes the probability ( @xmath54 ) that the atom occupies state @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the coherence between the two atomic states , which is related with the polarization induced in the the atom by the light field ; see below .",

    "( [ e1a])([e3a ] ) shows that , in the absence of interaction ( @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 in the new notation ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constant and @xmath70 oscillate at the low ( non optical ) frequency @xmath71 .",

    "the ensemble averaged density matrix is called the _ population matrix _",
    "@xcite , although the name density matrix is more frequently used obscuring the differences between the two operators .",
    "here we are not going to introduce the population matrix rigorously and we refer the interested reader to @xcite or @xcite for further details .    the population matrix of an ensemble of molecules is defined as @xmath78 here ; hence atoms are grouped according to that coordinate . in the general three  dimensional case , a population matrix @xmath79 must be defined at every differential volume , analogously to ( [ population ] ) .",

    "@xmath85 is the number of such molecules , which is assumed to be independent of @xmath2 and @xmath83 .",
    "the equation of evolution of the population matrix has two contributions : one of them is formally like the schrdinger ",
