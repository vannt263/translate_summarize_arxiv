    "accurate measurements of fundamental stellar parameters  particularly radius , luminosity and mass  are essential for critically testing the current generation of stellar models .",
    "some of these parameters can be constrained using well - established techniques such as spectrophotometry , parallax and optical interferometry . in the last decade , observing stellar oscillation frequencies ( asteroseismology ) has been shown to be a powerful tool to infer the internal structure of stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the mean stellar density can be estimated from the large frequency separation @xmath5 between consecutive radial overtones .",
    "the links between asteroseismology and interferometry have been comprehensively reviewed by @xcite .",
    "recently , the complementary roles played by these two techniques in the investigation of solar - type stars have been described by @xcite , who showed the mass of a single star can be determined to a precision ( 1-@xmath6 ) of better than 2 per cent by combining a good radius measurement with the density inferred from the large separation .",
    "indeed , this precision was almost obtained by @xcite when they constrained the mass of @xmath0  hyi to a precision of 2.8 per cent using results from optical interferometry and asteroseismology ( see also @xcite ) . moreover , @xcite further constrained the fundamental parameters of @xmath0  hyi with values for the stellar radius , luminosity , effective temperature and surface gravity .",
    "the star @xmath0 virginis ( hr 4540 , hd 102870 , hip 57757 ) has spectral type f9v @xcite and is slightly metal - rich , with @xmath7 } = 0.14 $ ] .",
    "it is bright ( @xmath8 ) and has a well - determined parallax .",
    "models by @xcite using the geneva evolution code , including rotation and atomic diffusion , indicate that the star has a mass of 1.21.3m@xmath9 and is close to , or just past , the end of main - sequence core - hydrogen burning .",
    "evidence for solar - like oscillations in  was reported by @xcite , in the form of excess power at frequencies around 1.7mhz .",
    "subsequently , @xcite confirmed the presence of oscillations and identified a series of regularly spaced modes with a large frequency separation of @xmath10hz .",
    "in this paper we present the first interferometric measurement of the angular diameter of  ( section  [ sec : diam ] ) .",
    "we also calculate the bolometric flux of the star using data from the literature ( section  [ sec : flux ] ) .",
    "these , together with the parallax from _ hipparcos _ and the density from asteroseismology , allow us to constrain the fundamental stellar parameters of  ( effective temperature , radius , luminosity and mass ; section  [ sec : params ] ) .",
    "measurements of the squared visibility  @xmath11 ( the normalised squared - modulus of the complex visibility ) were made on a total of 12 nights using the sydney university stellar interferometer ( susi ; @xcite ) .",
    "we recorded interference fringes with the red - table beam - combination system using a filter with ( nominal ) centre wavelength 700 nm and full - width at half - maximum 80 nm .",
    "this beam - combination system has been described in @xcite along with details of the standard susi observing , data reduction and calibration procedures .",
    "the parameters of the calibrator stars are given in table  [ tab : cal ] .",
    "there are no measured angular diameters for these stars , and the values given here were estimated from @xmath12 colours by interpolating measurements of similar stars with the narrabri stellar intensity interferometer @xcite and the mark iii optical interferometer @xcite .",
    "corrections for limb - darkening were done using the results of @xcite .",
    ".parameters of calibrator stars . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath13 @xcite",
    "the observable quantities , limb - darkened angular diameter ( @xmath14 ) , bolometric flux ( @xmath15 ) received from the star , parallax ( @xmath16 ) and large separation ( @xmath5 ) combine to produce experimental constraints on the stellar radius ( @xmath17 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath18 ) , luminosity ( @xmath19 ) , mean density ( @xmath20 ) , mass ( @xmath21 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "values for these observable quantities are given in table  [ tab : params ] , along with the stellar parameters that are calculated in the remainder of this section .",
    "the stellar radius can be determined using our limb - darkened angular diameter and the _ hipparcos _ parallax , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the conversion from parsecs to metres , @xmath14 is in radians and @xmath16 is in arcsec .",
    "note that the revised _ hipparcos _ parallax of @xmath25mas @xcite has a substantially smaller uncertainty than the original value of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we obtain a stellar radius for @xmath0  vir of @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with @xmath27r@xmath9 produced from surface brightness relations and the _ hipparcos _ parallax by @xcite , but is more precise and is based on a direct measurement .      the combination of the stellar bolometric flux and angular diameter yields an empirical effective temperature : @xmath28 where @xmath6 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "combining the new value for the bolometric flux ( section  [ sec : flux ] ) with the limb - darkened angular diameter ( section  [ sec : diam ] ) gives the effective temperature for @xmath0  vir as @xmath3k .",
    "the new value for the effective temperature can be compared with the previous estimates listed in table  [ tab : lit ] .",
    "there is excellent agreement with the line - depth ratio determination by @xcite and the determinations by @xcite and @xcite from the strmgren photometry using the calibrations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the methods are completely independent , with only the new value presented here being based on a direct measurement of the angular diameter of the star",
    ".    the values for the bolometric flux of @xmath29 by @xcite and @xmath30 by @xcite led those authors to effective temperatures of 6088k and 6124k respectively .",
    "however , if their bolometric fluxes are combined with our value for the limb - darkened angular diameter they give effective temperatures of 6054k and 6083k respectively , both of which are consistent with the value for the effective temperature presented here .",
    "the luminosity of a star can be calculated via @xmath31 where @xmath24 is the conversion from parsecs to metres and @xmath32 is in arcsec . substituting our value for @xmath15 gives @xmath33w .",
    "following the work of @xcite , we have adopted l@xmath34w and so get @xmath4 .    a recent determination of @xmath0  vir s luminosity by @xcite , based on applying a bolometric correction to the absolute visual magnitude , gave @xmath35l@xmath9 , which agrees with our value .",
    "@xcite collected high - precision velocity measurements of over eleven nights with the coralie spectrograph .",
    "the fourier spectrum showed a clear power excess in a broad frequency range centred at 1.5mhz , confirming the presence of solar - like oscillations first reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the autocorrelation of their power spectrum showed peaks at 70.5 , 72 and 74 , and they identified the second of these as the most likely value for the large frequency separation . after extracting oscillation frequencies and fitting to the asymptotic relation @xcite",
    ", they reported a value for the large separation of @xmath36 .    to a good approximation",
    ", the mean stellar density can be calculated from the observed large frequency separation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath37 using the large separation for  reported by @xcite , and adopting solar values of @xmath38g@xmath39 and @xmath40  @xcite , we obtain @xmath41g@xmath39 .",
    "it is important to note that equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) is an approximation . in particular , @xmath5 in a given star varies systematically with both frequency and with the angular degree of the modes .",
    "a more sophisticated approach involves comparing the observed oscillation frequencies with those calculated from an appropriate stellar model ( this was done for @xmath0  vir by @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , due to the difficulty in modelling convection in the surface layers of stars , model calculations do not exactly reproduce observed oscillation frequencies , even for the sun @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy increases with frequency , which means that the large separation is incorrectly predicted by the model calculations .",
    "for example , as discussed by @xcite , the best models of the sun have a large separation that is about 1 greater than the observed value .    to address this problem ,",
    "@xcite have proposed an empirical method for correcting the frequencies of stellar models .",
    "they applied this method to the stars , and and obtained very accurate estimates of the mean stellar densities ( better than 0.5  per cent ) .",
    "the same approach was used by @xcite to measure the density of  with similar precision .",
    "we have attempted to apply this method to , using the oscillation frequencies published by @xcite .",
    "we computed theoretical models using the aarhus stellar evolution code ( astec , @xcite ) , and oscillation frequencies using the aarhus adiabatic oscillation package ( adipls , @xcite ) .",
    "we followed the method described by @xcite , which involves fitting both  and the absolute frequencies of the radial modes ( i.e. , those having degree @xmath42 ) .",
    "the method makes use of the fact that the frequency offset between observations and models should tend to zero with decreasing frequency .",
    "however , we were not able to achieve a fit with models whose fundamental parameters ( luminosity and radius ) agreed with the measured values . in other words , the frequencies of the radial modes listed by @xcite do not appear to be consistent with models .",
    "indeed , for  @xcite remarked on an offset of more than 20  between observed and calculated frequencies , which they noted to be substantially larger than the corresponding offset for the sun .",
    "note that our conclusion that the published frequencies are inconsistent with models is not sensitive to the input physics of the evolutionary models .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that their fitting process works for models published by different authors using a range of model codes .",
    "two effects could have introduced a systematic offset to the observed frequencies .",
    "firstly , an offset of @xmath43 could occur because of the cycle - per - day aliases in the power spectrum , which are strong in single - site observations such as those obtained for .",
    "indeed , many of the frequencies listed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table  2 ) were shifted by 11.6  in one direction or the other in order to give a good fit to the p - mode spectrum .",
    "this includes the highest peak in the power spectrum , from which 11.6  was subtracted .",
    "a second possibility is that the modes were misidentified , so that modes of odd and even degree were interchanged .",
    "that is , modes identified as having degree @xmath42 actually have degree @xmath44 , and vice versa .",
    "such a misidentification is plausible and , in the context of the method of @xcite , would be equivalent to subtracting an offset of @xmath45 from the frequencies of all modes .",
    "we found that neither of the above corrections was able to give a consistent result , but we did find a good agreement between models and observations if we applied both together .",
    "that is , adding 11.6  and subtracting @xmath46 from the frequencies identified as radial modes gave a sensible result .",
    "however , if this scenario is correct then the whole mode identification process would be called into question , and it would be risky to rely on the tabulated frequencies to establish a precise density .    until more oscillation data become available , we therefore fall back on the density that we determined from equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "looking at the results for other stars @xcite , we estimate that this relation gives the mean density with an uncertainty of about 2  per cent .",
    "we have therefore adopted this value for the uncertainty in the density , as shown in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "combining our radius measurement with the mean density inferred from asteroseismology , we calculate the mass to be @xmath47m@xmath9 .",
    "this is slightly higher than previous estimates based on fitting models in the h - r diagram : @xmath48m@xmath9 @xcite , @xmath49m@xmath9 @xcite and @xmath50m@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the difference is not statistically significant , but we should point out that adopting a value of @xmath51 , which is another of the three peaks in the autocorrelation of the observed power spectrum identified by @xcite , gives a mass of @xmath52 .",
    "this value , which is also shown in table  [ tab : params ] , is in better agreement with the location of the star in the h - r diagram .",
    "the models by @xcite suggest that  either has a mass of @xmath531.3m@xmath9 and is towards the end of its main - sequence lifetime , or else it has mass of @xmath531.2m@xmath9 and is in the post main - sequence phase . assuming that one of 70.5 or 72.1@xmath54hz is the correct large spacing , then the post main - sequence model appears to be excluded , indicating that @xmath0  vir is still on the main sequence .",
    "clearly , establishing the age of the star is also affected by the uncertainy in the mass . a more precise determination of its mass and evolutionary state will require further observations of its oscillations , preferably from multiple sites .",
    "substituting the stellar mass with the mean density and volume , the standard surface gravity relation becomes @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the universal constant of gravitation . in table",
    "[ tab : params ] we show @xmath22 for the two values of @xmath57 . both determinations are consistent with the published values ( see table  [ tab : lit ] ) , which is not surprising given that spectroscopic determinations of @xmath22 are not very precise .",
    "we have presented the first angular diameter measurement of the f9v star @xmath0  vir . in combination with the revised values for the bolometric flux and parallax ,",
    "this angular diameter has experimentally constrained the stellar radius and effective temperature .",
    "the radius measurement , combined with the mean density determined from asteroseismology , allows an estimate of @xmath0  vir s mass and surface gravity .",
    "the constraints on @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath19 that we present will be invaluable in the future to further test theoretical models of @xmath0  vir and its oscillations . as stressed by @xcite , for example , oscillation frequencies are of most importance for testing evolution theories when the other fundamental stellar properties are well - constrained .",
