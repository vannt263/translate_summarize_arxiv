    "quantitative description of particle systems in the strong - coupling regime remains one of the most challenging problems of contemporary particle theory .",
    "the electromagnetic structure of light mesons represents an ideal testbed for various approaches to practical calculations at strong coupling , including low - energy effective theories of strong interactions and their connection to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "not surprisingly , experimental understanding of various aspects of the meson structure comprises an important part of the scientific program of the upgraded jefferson laboratory ( jlab )  @xcite , presently ready for its start . in particular , the e12 - 09 - 011 experiment , scheduled in jlab hall  c for 2017 , will attempt to measure the @xmath2-meson electromagnetic form factor , @xmath1 , at the momentum transfer squared up to @xmath8  gev@xmath7 @xcite . in this work",
    ", we address some important implications of this expected result and revisit previous scarce data on @xmath1 in the frameworks of a successful theoretical model .",
    "some time ago , a model for the electromagnetic form factor of the charged @xmath0 meson , @xmath9 , has been developed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description ) , possessing a few free parameters , fixed in 1998  @xcite from the experimental data available at that time .",
    "the model predicted subsequent experimental results on @xmath9 surprisingly well  @xcite without further tuning of parameters , despite the fact that the experimentally accessible range of @xmath3 was extended by an order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the model with the very same parameters predicts the correct qcd asymptotics at large @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the model was also applied to the calculation of electroweak parameters of the @xmath10 meson  @xcite , for which particular interesting relations have been obtained .",
    "the theoretical grounds for the model include a relativistic - invariant approximation  @xcite to the instant form of the relativistic hamiltonian dynamics ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while the model s quantitative parameters in the light - quark sector are fixed from the @xmath0-meson study  @xcite .    in this paper , the model",
    "is applied to the @xmath2 meson .",
    "this brings two additional parameters into the game , one being the mass of the strange constituent quark , @xmath11 , and another describing the interaction in the light - heavy quark system . in the case of the @xmath0 meson ,",
    "the two corresponding parameters were uniquely determined from two measured observables , the @xmath0-meson decay constant , @xmath12 , and charge radius , @xmath13 , which determines the form - factor behaviour at low @xmath3 .",
    "we will demonstrate below that , for the @xmath2 meson , the decay constant , @xmath14 , fixes one combination of parameters , while the charge radius , @xmath4 , is known with large uncertainties , which makes it difficult to use it for fixing the remaining parameter .",
    "we therefore keep it free and obtain a range of the model parameters consistent with the present data .",
    "we address old measurements of @xmath1 at @xmath5 obtained in the na-7 experiment at cern sps @xcite , which represents the most precise source of experimental input for determination of @xmath4 . the value of @xmath4 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and , since then , extensively used in numerous experimental and theoretical works , was estimated from fitting the data points in the pole approximation .",
    "we demonstrate that the range of @xmath3 studied in ref .",
    "@xcite was sufficiently large for deviations from this approximation to become important .",
    "we fit the na-7 data points with our exact functions for @xmath1 , which results in a slightly shifted value of @xmath4 .",
    "we note that the obtained allowed range of @xmath4 , bounded by the 68% cl agreement with the data and by the consistency of the model , is in a better agreement with the recent lattice results @xcite than the original result of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "turning to higher energies , we use the constraints on @xmath4 to fix the allowed range of @xmath1 functions at modestly large @xmath15  gev@xmath7 .",
    "we observe that the spread of the theoretical curves exceeds considerably the expected precision of the e12 - 09 - 011 experiment in jlab .",
    "therefore , within our approach , the e12 - 09 - 011 results might be used not only to study @xmath1 at moderate @xmath3 but also to constrain its behavior at @xmath5 and to further narrow the experimentally allowed range of @xmath4 .",
    "this improvement in the value of a very soft parameter represents an unexpected application of the coming experiment , aimed presumably at the studies at much higher momentum transfers , @xmath16  gev@xmath7 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formfactor ] , we describe briefly the model for @xmath1 , with the emphasis on the differences between the @xmath0- and @xmath2-meson models and on the two new parameters we have to introduce .",
    "section  [ sec : r_k ] addresses the experimental constraints on @xmath4 .",
    "the na-7 data are reanalized here in the frameworks of our model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : jlab ] , we present the expected @xmath1 behavior at larger @xmath3 and demonstrate how the e12 - 09 - 011 jlab experiment may improve the precision of the @xmath4 measurement . we briefly conclude in sec .  [ sec : concl ] and present a more detailed description of the model in the appendix .",
    "the approach we used is based on the instant - form dirac relativistic hamiltonian dynamics ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) supplemented by the relativistic - invariant modified impulse approximation  @xcite .",
    "the form factor of a system of two quarks with different masses meson is well described with @xmath17 .",
    "] has been calculated , within this approach , in ref .",
    "@xcite . for completeness ,",
    "all necessary formulae are collected in the appendix .    in general , we need to know five parameters to proceed with the real numerical calculation .",
    "they include the masses of the two constituent quarks , @xmath18 and @xmath11 ; the parameter of the two - quark phenomenological wave function , @xmath19 , with the physical meaning of the confinement scale ; and two anomalous magnetic moments of quarks , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the values of the latters are fixed in the same way as it was done for the @xmath0 meson , that is through the gerasimov sum rules , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details and the appendix for explicit expressions .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is , clearly , the same as it was used for the @xmath0 meson .",
    "we also take advantage of the working model for @xmath9 where @xmath22  gev was fixed .",
    "the phenomenological confinemenet scale , @xmath19 , may in principle be different for different systems , and , for the moment , we keep it as a free parameter , together with @xmath11 .",
    "to fix the two free parameters , @xmath19 and @xmath18 , for the @xmath0 meson , two experimental observables were used .",
    "one was the meson decay constant , @xmath12 , and another was the meson charge radius , @xmath13 , determined from experimental measurements of @xmath9 at @xmath5 . for the @xmath2 meson",
    ", we may equally well use the decay constant , @xmath14 , to eliminate one of the parameters .",
    "the expression relating @xmath14 to the model parameters was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and is presented in the appendix .",
    "it would be natural to use the experimental information on the @xmath2-meson charge radius , @xmath4 , to fix the single remaining free parameter and to predict the behaviour of @xmath1 in the yet unexplored domain of large @xmath3 .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section , this approach is limited by the poor experimental knowledge of @xmath4 .",
    "the form factor @xmath1 was measured by the na-7 experiment at cern sps , ref .",
    "this measurement of 1986 remains the most recent and the most precise one , and we will concentrate on its results in what follows .",

    "@xcite when the condition @xmath24 was not used , though a departure from this condition is unphysical ) .",
    "this resulted in the value of @xmath25  fm@xmath7 ( 50% cl ) , widely used in subsequent studies .",
    "however , one may note that the actual @xmath1 function may deviate from the pole approximation already at @xmath27  gev@xmath7 , so that corrections to the pole approximation are already important for the na-7 data range .",
    "this means that , to determine the derivative of @xmath1 at @xmath28 , and hence @xmath4 , one should use either a shorter range of @xmath3 or a more complicated approximation .",
    "the first option fails because of the insufficient number of data points .",
    "fortunately , as described above , we can calculate the function @xmath1 within our approach .",
    "the model has one free parameter which we use to fit , by means of the usual @xmath29 method , the na-7 data points . to do that , we consider the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath30 of the model , see fig .",

    "however , we note that , being derived from the same data , our value for @xmath4 shares similar large statistical uncertainties with the original result .",
    "the use of the low-@xmath3 data constrains the remaining free parameter of the model through the fitting procedure described in the previous section . in principle , this allows us to calculate the @xmath1 function for a large range of @xmath3 and to make predictions for the future jlab measurements .",

    "[ fig : fk - comparison ] , one immediately notes that the uncertainty in our predictions , determined by the uncertainty in the @xmath4 measurements , exceeds the expected precision of the experiment and is of order the typical difference between model predictions .",
    "the e12 - 09 - 011 experiment would be able to distinguish between our model and several other ones .",
    "in addition , this consideration opens a surprising new possibility to constrain the low-@xmath3 behavior of @xmath1 and to reduce the experimental uncertainty in @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , the expected error bars of the experiment are smaller than the spread of @xmath1 curves predicted in our model . this spread is determined by a single parameter of the model which determines the behavior of @xmath1 at @xmath5 .",

    "all but two parameters of the model are fixed from its successful application to the @xmath0-meson form factor in previous studies , where , experimentally , the model predictions had been confirmed precisely by a number of subsequent measurements , and theoretically , the correct qcd asymptotics was reproduced .",
    "of the two parameters specific for the @xmath2-meson case , one combination is fixed from the @xmath2-meson decay constant , @xmath14 , while the remaining one is related to the @xmath2-meson charge radius , @xmath4 .",
