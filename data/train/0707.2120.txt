    "in the recent progress of unstable nuclear physics , various kinds of exotic structure have been discovered .",
    "many of these phenomena in light nuclear region are often related to cluster physics . from the viewpoints of nuclear cluster , there are many theoretical works on halo structure in neutron - rich nuclei and molecular structure in be isotopes .",
    "recently , tohsaki _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a new type of cluster structure in the second @xmath14 state @xmath12c , where 3 @xmath13 clusters are weakly interacting@xcite .",
    "this is a dilute gas state of @xmath13 particles which behave as bosonic particles in the dilute density .",
    "this phenomena is associated with bose - einstein condensation(bec ) and is called `` alpha condensation '' .",
    "the alpha condensation was originally suggested in dilute nuclear matter by rpke et al.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 of @xmath12c is regarded as an example , where the alpha condensation is realized in a finite nuclear system .",
    "then , it is challenging to search for such cluster - gas states in other nuclei .",
    "in analogy to the alpha condensation , dineutron condensation in neutron matter is a recent key issue in physics of unstable nuclei .",
    "matsuo suggested that the dineutron correlation can be enhanced in dilute neutron matter@xcite . in real systems , one should focus on dineutron correlation in finite nuclei such as halo nuclei and extremely neutron - rich nuclei , or that in neutron skin at a surface region of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "in fact , the dineutron correlation in two - neutron halo nuclei like @xmath2he and @xmath15li attracts great interests in these days . in case of @xmath2he , where the @xmath1he is the good core ,",
    "the dineutron correlation of the valence neutrons has been demonstrated in three - body model calculations ( for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "now , let us consider structure of @xmath3he from a point of view associated with the dineutron condensation .",
    "firstly , more than one dineutrons are required to construct a dineutron condensate state . in @xmath3he ,",
    "two pairs of neutrons are possible from four valence neutrons around the @xmath1he core . in second , @xmath3he system may have some correspondence with the @xmath12c system , because both of them have the same neutron number , @xmath16 .",
    "in analogy to @xmath12c , the ground state of @xmath3he may have a feature of the neutron @xmath5 closure or the su(3)-limit @xmath17-shell configuration . instead of the ground state",
    ", one can speculate the dineutron gas - like state with developed @xmath1he+@xmath10+@xmath10 structure in excited states .",
    "there are many theoretical works on he isotopes .",
    "application of _ ab initio _ calculations such as gfmc and ncsm with realistic nuclear forces have now reached to the mass @xmath18 region including @xmath2he and @xmath3he@xcite .",
    "systematic studies of he isotopes have been performed also by model calculations with effective interactions such as cluster models as well as gsm@xcite and mean field approaches@xcite .",
    "three - body model with an assumption of the @xmath1he core has been often adopted to study @xmath2he @xcite and it has been applied to heavier he isotopes @xcite . @xmath3he and @xmath19he have been also studied by such models as @xmath1he+@xmath20 models @xcite and by extended models @xcite which have less assumption of the core . with fermionic molecular dynamics , the study of he isotopes has been performed based on a realistic nuclear force @xcite . however , many of these studies are concentrated on the ground states except for three - body models , gsm and gfmc .    after the experimental indication of neutron skin structure in @xmath3he@xcite , many experimental works on @xmath3he",
    "have been recently performed to reveal the detailed properties of the ground state .",
    "the core excitation @xmath2he@xmath21 in the ground state , which has been experimentally suggested@xcite , indicates that @xmath3he is different from a simple three - body state of @xmath2he@xmath22+@xmath10 .",
    "recent experiments using @xmath3he beams suggested the significant component of the @xmath23 configuration @xcite .",
    "they may support dineutron correlation in the @xmath3he ground state rather than the pure @xmath24 closure of neutrons . on the other hand ,",
    "a measurement of spectroscopic factor of @xmath25he(@xmath26)@xcite in @xmath3he suggested the pure sub - shell closed structure contradictory to the other experimental results .",
    "thus , the neutron structure of the @xmath3he ground state is controversial .",
    "concerning excited states , although some levels are known to exist in the energy @xmath27 mev region , the experimental information is very poor for these states except for the @xmath28 state @xcite .    in this paper , we investigated structure of @xmath3he .",
    "in particular , we focused on @xmath14 states and discuss their dineutron component , because one of our major aims is to search for the dineutron gas - like state .",
    "we applied a method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd)@xcite , which has been already proved to be useful in describing cluster structure in light nuclei .",
    "amd has been applied to various light unstable nuclei such as he , li , be isotopes as well as stable nuclei .",
    "it has been applied also for study of cluster gas - like states in @xmath12c and @xmath15c(@xmath15b)@xcite . in the present work",
    ", we adopted a amd+generator coordinate method(gcm ) .",
    "namely , we superposed a number of amd wave functions , which were obtained by energy variation with constraints , to take various configurations into account .",
    "we comment that the theoretical method amd+gcm of the present calculation is similar to those of the amd+gcm and amd+sss works on he isotopes by itagaki and his collaborators @xcite in a sense that multi configurations of amd wave functions are superposed . in @xcite , @xmath1he+@xmath20 and @xmath29",
    "configurations were _ a priori _ assumed .",
    "another claim is that they used an effective interaction which makes a bound @xmath30 . in the present work",
    ", we have no assumption of the cluster core and chose effective interactions by taking care of subsystem energies such as @xmath13-@xmath31 and @xmath2he as well as nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "we used some sets of interaction parameters and showed the calculated results of the ground and excited states of he isotopes . by assuming @xmath32 configuration as the interior structure of a dineutron , we analyzed dineutron structure of @xmath3he and compared it with the @xmath13-cluster structure of @xmath12c .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly explain the theoretical method of the present work .",
    "results are given in [ sec : results ] , and dineutron structure is discussed in [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "finally , we give a summary in [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly explain the formulation of amd+gcm in the present calculation . the detailed formulation of the amd method for nuclear structure study is described in @xcite .",
    "there are various versions of practical methods of the amd framework . in the present work",
    ", we performed superposition of a number of amd wave functions obtained by energy variation with constraints based on the concept of gcm .",
    "the procedure of the variation , spin and parity projection and superposition is similar to those of amd+gcm calculations in @xcite , though the details of model wave functions and effective interactions are different from each other .",
    "an amd wave function is a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets ; @xmath33 where the @xmath34th single - particle wave function is written by a product of spatial(@xmath35 ) , intrinsic spin(@xmath36 ) and isospin(@xmath37 ) wave functions as , @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are spatial and spin functions , and @xmath41 is isospin function which is fixed to be up(proton ) or down(neutron ) . the width parameter @xmath42 is chosen to be the optimum value for each system .",
    "accordingly , an amd wave function is expressed by a set of variational parameters , @xmath43 .",
    "the energy variation was performed for the parity - projected amd wave function @xmath44 under constraints . in order to obtain basis wave functions",
    ", we adopted the total oscillator quanta and deformation as the constraints .",
    "hereafter , we note the expectation value of an operator @xmath45 with respect to a normalized parity - projected amd wave function as @xmath46 .",
    "expectation values @xmath47 of the total oscillator quanta is given by the creation and annihilation operators of harmonic oscillator in the same way as @xcite .",
    "in the amd+gcm calculations with the @xmath48-constraint ( for example @xcite ) , the deformation is usually constrained by using the rotational invariant value @xmath49 , where the matrix @xmath50 is calculated by quadrupole operators as @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) @xcite . here",
    "@xmath54 is approximately related to the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath48 as @xmath55 . in the present work",
    ", we used the modified quadrupole matrix @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the mass number ) instead of the original @xmath58 and imposed the constraint on the @xmath59 .",
    "this is useful for he isotopes to obtain basis wave functions with various configurations on mesh points of the two - dimensional parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "the energy variation with the constraint values @xmath60 and @xmath61 was performed with respect to the parity - projected amd wave function by minimizing the energy defined as , @xmath62 here the artificial potentials are introduced to satisfy the condition of the constraints . with a given set of constraint values @xmath63 the optimum wave function @xmath64 was obtained .",
    "finally , we superposed the spin - parity eigen states projected from the obtained wave functions , @xmath65 were determined by diagonalizing the hamiltonian and norm matrices . in the present calculations , we took only @xmath66 states .",
    "@xmath2he , @xmath3he and @xmath19he were calculated by the amd+gcm method .",
    "the strengths , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , for the constraint potentials in eq.[eq : const ] are chosen to be 30 mev and 2000 mev , respectively .",
    "we chose the width parameter @xmath42 to optimize the energy for the @xmath69 , which gives the minimum energy among the states @xmath70 in most cases . here",
    ", @xmath71 is the minimum value of the harmonic - oscillator quanta , @xmath722 , 4 , and 6 for @xmath2he , @xmath3he , and @xmath19he , respectively .",
    "a common @xmath42 value for each he isotope are used in the calculation with each interaction .",
    "the adopted @xmath42 values are listed in table [ tab : int ] .",
    "we adopted the constraint values of the mesh points @xmath73 on the @xmath60-@xmath61 plane as @xmath74(@xmath75=0,1,2,3,4,6,8,10 for positive parity states and @xmath75=1,2,3,4,6,8,10 for negative parity states ) and @xmath76=0 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , @xmath77 , 1.6 .",
    "then , the total number of the basis wave functions are 72(63 ) for positive(negative)-parity states . on the @xmath60-@xmath78 plane",

    "then we searched for @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 ) starting from the @xmath64 by increasing(or decreasing ) @xmath60 one by one .",
    "some of the basis wave functions with the constraints have the breaking of the @xmath1he - core .",
    "such the basis wave functions with the @xmath1he - core breaking have high energies in general , and therefore , they practically give only small contribution to the low - lying states of @xmath2he , @xmath3he and @xmath19he isotopes .",
    "it means that the @xmath1he cluster is a rather good core in @xmath2he , @xmath3he and @xmath19he isotopes , while the motion of valence neutrons is relatively important .    .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     compared with the experimental data , the theoretical values of the @xmath28 excitation energy are higher than the experimental one .",
    "however , it is important that the level structure for the excited states , @xmath28 , @xmath9 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , is not sensitive to the adopted interaction though the relative position to the ground energy depends on the interaction .",
    "the @xmath9 state is theoretically suggested to appear just above the @xmath28 state .",
    "what is striking is that the @xmath9 state has a remarkably large neutron radius compared with the ground state because of developed @xmath96 structure . in the obtained wave function of the @xmath9 state , which is given by a superposition of the basis amd wave functions ,",
    "the amplitude is found to be widely distributed into the basis wave functions with various spatial configuration of @xmath96 .",
    "this indicates a gas - like feature that the dineutrons are rather freely moving around the @xmath1he core .",
    "therefore , we consider that the @xmath9 state is the candidate of the cluster gas - like state with two dineutrons around the @xmath13 core . the detailed discussion of the dineutron - like structure is given later .",
    "in the experimental energy spectra , some excited states were observed above the @xmath28 state .",
    "spins and parities of these states are not definitely assigned yet . in the present calculations ,",
    "the predicted @xmath9 state has the strong monopole neutron transition from the ground states as the matrix element @xmath97 @xmath98 in the m56(v58 ) results .",
    "this neutron matrix element is much larger than the observed proton matrix element @xmath99 @xmath98 of @xmath12c by more than factor 2 .",
    "therefore , we consider that the @xmath3he(@xmath9 ) might be excited by inelastic scattering on nuclear target",
    ".    the excited states of @xmath3he have been theoretically predicted by a few other calculations such as csm and gfmc .",
    "the csm gives better agreement of the @xmath28 excitation energy with the experimental data@xcite .",
    "we also comment that the gfmc calculation with av18/il2 , which is an _ ab initio _ calculation with the realistic 2-body force and the empirical 3-body force , gives similar level structure to the present m56 results .",
    "namely , the gfmc with av18/il2 gives the @xmath100 state at @xmath101 mev and the @xmath102 , @xmath9 and @xmath103 states in the @xmath104 mev region .",
    "there is no bound state in an isolate @xmath105 system .",
    "however , it has been emphasized in many theoretical works that the spatial neutron - neutron correlation plays an important in the binding mechanism of the borromean systems with two - neutron halo such as @xmath2he and @xmath15li ( for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the neutron - neutron correlation is characterized by a spin - zero @xmath105 pair with spatial correlation in @xmath7 wave . in the correlation density of two - neutron halo nuclei ,",
    "a peak of the probability appears at the region with a small @xmath31-@xmath31 distance(@xmath106 ) and a large @xmath31-core distance in general .",
    "this corresponds to the dineutron correlation . in an extended meaning",
    ", it is regarded as a `` dineutron cluster '' which can virtually exist in loosely bound neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "as mentioned above , the characteristics of the dineutron are the zero spin and the spatial correlation . in the correlation density for @xmath2he , @xmath15li and @xmath107be given by three - body calculations @xcite , the peak for the dineutron correlation are seen typically around the @xmath108 fm with a ridge in the @xmath109 fm region .",
    "it is important that this @xmath31-@xmath31 distance at the peak nearly depends on the system size among these three systems , @xmath2he , @xmath15li and @xmath107be . from this most probable @xmath31-@xmath31 distance",
    ", the typical size of the spatial correlation of the @xmath105 pair can be estimated to be about 2 fm .",
    "then , we here approximately describe the dineutron cluster , @xmath30 , by a spin - zero neutron pair written by the simple harmonic - oscillator @xmath32 state with the size parameter @xmath110 in order to investigate dineutron structure in @xmath3he .",

    "cm    in order to investigate features of dineutron cluster structure in the @xmath14 states of @xmath3he , we extracted the @xmath30-cluster motion from the obtained @xmath3he(@xmath14 ) wave functions .",

    "the most striking thing is that the @xmath3he@xmath127 state has the large amplitude of the dineutron cluster in the long distance region around @xmath131 fm , which well corresponds to the peak position of the @xmath13-cluster motion in the @xmath12c(@xmath9 ) .",
    "the enhancement of the @xmath30-cluster component at the long distance is more remarkable in the v58 results than the m56 results .",
    "the cluster probability of the @xmath3he(@xmath9 ) , which is defined by the integrated overlap with the @xmath2he@xmath122-@xmath30 cluster wave functions , is @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the v58 and the m56 results .",
    "the larger development of the @xmath30 clustering in the v58 results is considered to be because of the stronger @xmath31-@xmath31 interaction in the v58 than the m56 interaction .",
    "it is very important that , even with the weaker @xmath31-@xmath31 interactions of the m56 , the @xmath30-cluster structure survives with the significant component in the @xmath3he(@xmath9 ) .",
    "considering that the other @xmath30 cluster exists inside the @xmath2he@xmath122 core , it is regarded that the @xmath3he(@xmath9 ) has the component of the developed @xmath1he+@xmath30+@xmath30 clustering , where two dineutrons are moving in @xmath123 orbits .",

    "these results are consistent with the discussion of the @xmath30-cluster wave function in the previous subsection .",
    "we studied the structure of @xmath3he with a method of amd+gcm .",
    "we chose the effective nuclear interactions by taking care of energies of subsystems , and reproduced the properties of ground states of @xmath1he , @xmath2he and @xmath3he . in the ground state of @xmath3he ,",
    "the component of the @xmath5 sub - shell closure is dominant .",
    "however , the @xmath6-@xmath7 coupling feature is also significantly contained because of the spin - zero dineutron correlation .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental report on the significant mixing of @xmath23 component in the @xmath3he(@xmath129 .",
    "it is concluded that the @xmath3he(@xmath129 is the admixture of @xmath5 sub - shell closure and @xmath6-@xmath7 coupling @xmath17-shell configurations with a slight dineutron tail at the surface .",
    "this result is also consistent with the experimentally suggested large spectroscopic factor of the @xmath2he(@xmath100 ) in the @xmath3he(@xmath129 .",
    "the present results suggest that the @xmath9 state may appear a few mev above the @xmath28 state . by analyzing dineutron structure ,",
    "it was found that this state has a significant component of the developed @xmath1he+@xmath30+@xmath30 structure where two dineutrons are moving around the @xmath1he core in @xmath7 wave with a dilute density .",
    "the @xmath30-cluster wave function of the @xmath3he(@xmath9 ) state is similar to the @xmath13-cluster wave function of the @xmath12c(@xmath9 ) state .",
    "therefore , we consider that the predicted @xmath9 state is the candidate of the dineutron gas - like state , which is analogy to the @xmath13 condensate state suggested in the @xmath12c(@xmath9 ) . in the experimental energy spectra of @xmath3he ,",
    "some excited states were observed above the @xmath28 state .",
    "spins and parities of these states have not been definitely assigned yet . since the present calculations predicted the remarkable neutron matrix element for the monopole transitions @xmath3he(@xmath170he(@xmath130",
    ", we expect that the @xmath3he(@xmath9 ) might be excited in inelastic scattering on nuclear target .    since the amd framework is regarded as a kind of bound state approximation because of the restricted model space , coupling with continuum states is not taken into account . in future study , widths of the excited states should be carefully investigated by taking into account the continuum coupling in order to confirm the stability of the resonances against particle decays .    in the present work , the calculations were performed within the amd model space by using effective interactions .",
    "we chose the interaction parameters by taking care of subsystem energies such as @xmath13-@xmath31 , @xmath2he as well as nucleon - nucleon systems .",
    "although it is difficult to completely reproduce all of the subsystem energies with a unique effective interaction , we found the interaction which can reasonably reproduce the global feature of the subsystem energies .",
    "we here stress that the level structure of the excited states is not sensitive to the adopted nuclear forces within the reasonable choice of effective interaction , though the excitation energy relative to the ground state depends on the interaction .",
    "it is also important that the dineutron structure of the @xmath3he@xmath171 ) states is qualitatively similar among four sets of interaction adopted in the present calculations . for further investigations of he",
    "isotopes , more extended calculations based on the realistic forces should be important as well as _",
