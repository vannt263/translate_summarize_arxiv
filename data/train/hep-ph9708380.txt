    "during a relativistic heavy ion collision , it is possible to create a quark - gluon plasma , which will then cool and expand , leading to hadronization . at around the same time as hadronization , the system also undergoes a chiral phase transition which breaks the su(2 ) @xmath1 su(2 ) symmetry and which then gives physical masses to the pion and other particles .",
    "the out of equilibrium dynamics of this phase transition can be very interesting if the expansion is fast enough so that the phase transition resembles a quench . in this case",
    "the effective pion mass can go negative for short periods of proper time which leads to a temporary exponential growth of low momentum domains where the isospin can point in a particular direction ( dcc ) .",
    "this is a topic of current interest @xcite , since dccs may provide a signature of the chiral phase transition . in an earlier paper",
    "@xcite the time evolution of this chiral phase transition , assuming a uniform spherically symmetric expansion into the vacuum , was considered .",
    "the o(4 ) linear @xmath0 model in the large-@xmath2 approximation , which incorporates both nonequilibrium and quantum effects , was studied .",
    "a range of initial conditions was analyzed to determine which initial states could lead to the formation of dccs .",
    "this radial expansion is interesting because it is expected at late times in the plasma evolution , and also maximizes the cooling rate and therefore the possibility of the phase transition resembling a quench .    in this paper",
    "we go beyond previous work @xcite and study the proper time evolutions of the effective hydrodynamic collective variables of the system , namely the renormalized pressure and energy density .",
    "we want to see to what extent previous intuition coming from studying classical hydrodynamical models of particle production such as landau s model is confirmed .",
    "this requires the solution of a new technical issue , namely how one obtains a covariantly conserved energy - momentum tensor when one has an actual cutoff in the theory . as discussed in earlier work @xcite",
    ", the linear @xmath0 model is an effective theory with a renormalized coupling constant of order 10 , in order to agree with low energy pion properties .",
    "this leads to a maximum cutoff of around 1 gev in order to avoid problems at scales of the order of the landau pole .",
    "it has been shown earlier @xcite that as long as the momentum cutoff determined from the sum over mode functions is below the landau pole , there is a regime of cutoffs where the continuum renormalization group flow is obeyed so that one can safely say that one is in the continuum regime . for this class of problems , renormalization methods based on formal schemes such as dimensional regularization approaches",
    "are not very useful . here",
    "we have a real cutoff in physical momentum as a result of using an effective field theory , and we have to be very careful in order to obtain the correct covariantly conserved energy - momentum tensor which leads to our definitions of comoving energy density and pressure variables .",
    "the tools we use to correctly renormalize the energy - momentum tensor are first to introduce the physical cutoff @xmath3 and then to analyze the divergences in all the components of the energy - momentum tensor using an adiabatic expansion of the mode functions . by comparing our results with a covariant point - splitting approach @xcite",
    ", we can identify those terms which should survive in the covariant limit .",
    "this technique allows us to obtain finite energy densities and pressures which then enable us to study the effective equation of state for the evolving plasma .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the energy - momentum tensor for the o(4 ) linear @xmath0 model , and show how to regularize and renormalize it in order to obtain the physical energy density and pressure .",
    "we study initial conditions which have instabilities that lead to dcc formation and also stable initial configurations , and examine the energy density and pressure in both situations .",
    "we also consider the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor as a check on our numerical methods .",

    "<S> following a relativistic heavy ion collision , the quark - gluon plasma produced eventually undergoes a chiral phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that during this phase transition one can describe the dynamics of the system by the linear @xmath0 model and that the expansion can be thought of as mostly radial . because the @xmath0 model is an effective field theory there is an actual momentum cutoff ( landau pole ) in the theory at around 1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is necessary to find ways of obtaining a covariantly conserved , renormalized energy - momentum tensor when there is a cutoff present ( which breaks covariance ) , in order to identify the effective equation of state of this time evolving system . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to solve this technical problem and then determine the energy density and pressure of the system as a function of the proper time . </S>",
    "<S> we consider different initial conditions and search for instabilities which can lead to the formation of disoriented chiral condensates ( dccs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the energy density and pressure both decrease quickly , as is appropriate for a rapidly cooling system , and that the energy is numerically conserved . </S>"
