    "the appearance and propagation of ionization waves is the prelude of electrical breakdown of various media . in the case of a gas ,",
    "the specific features of the breakdown waves are determined by the type of the gas , the value of the pressure , the geometry of the discharge cell and the value and variation rate of the voltage at the electrodes .",
    "the geometry determines the space distribution of the electric field and hence the dynamics of the ionization fronts . in the case where there in no initial ionization in the discharge gap , the ionization wave may originate from one or several overlapping electron avalanches .",
    "after attenuation of the electric field in the avalanche body , a conducting channel or streamer develops : a plasma region fully ionized with a positive side expanding towards the cathode and a negative region towards the anode .",
    "one of the approaches used to model the development of the avalanche - streamer transition and the streamer propagation is a nonlinear system of balance equations with a diffusion - drift approximation for the currents , together with poisson equation @xcite .",
    "some progress in the understanding of the propagation mechanism has been achieved using that model .",
    "we can mention : the study of stationary plane ionization waves @xcite , self - similar solutions for ionization waves in cylindrical and spherical geometries @xcite , the effect of photoionization @xcite and a branching mechanism as the result of the instability of planar ionization fronts @xcite . in this hydrodynamic approximation ,",
    "the fronts are subject to both stabilizing forces due to diffusion which tend to dampen out any disturbances , and destabilizing forces due to electric field which promote them .",
    "the solution of the model , even in the simplest cases , poses a challenging problem both numerical and analytical .",
    "early numerical simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , a contour dynamics model have been deduced in the limit of small electron diffusion @xcite , which resembles the taylor - melcher leaky dielectric model for electrolyte solutions @xcite , but adapted to the context of electric ( plasma ) discharges .",
    "this contour dynamics model allows to study more general situations in two - dimensional and three - dimensional cases",
    ".     represents the negative surface charge density .",
    "the electric field points towards the plasma region in this case.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the contour dynamics model consists of an interface separating a plasma region from a neutral gas region as it is shown in fig .  [ fig1a ] .",
    "the separating surface has a net charge @xmath0 and the thickness goes to zero as @xmath1 being @xmath2 the charge diffusion coefficient .",
    "the case displayed in the figure correspond a negative discharge , so the electric field is pointing towards the plasma region and @xmath0 is the negative charge density at the surface .",
    "the front will evolve following the equation @xmath3where @xmath4 is the normal component of the electric field at the interface when approaching it from outside the plasma region , @xmath5 the eletron mobility , @xmath6 is the electron diffusion coefficient , e@xmath7 is a characteristic ionization electric field and @xmath8 the curvature of the interface .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is the microscopic ionization characteristic length . at the interface ,",
    "the total negative surface charge density will change according to @xmath10being now @xmath11 the electric field at the interface coming from inside the plasma , @xmath12 is a parameter proportional to the resistivity of the electrons in the created plasma and @xmath13 the current contribution of any electromotive force if present .",
    "although the equations and are written for the case of a negative front plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] , and we will present the derivation of the model for this case , we could use in principle the same model for a positive front , but the electric field should be sign reversed , and @xmath0 would represent the positive surface charge density . although the moving carriers in the model are the electrons , one may think of a front made of _ holes _ , with a positive surface charge density , and characterized with the corresponding parameters for the mobility , diffusion and so on .    in this paper , using the contour dynamics model , we will study cylindrical discharges when the plasma has finite conductivity .",
    "the dispersion curve for transversal instabilities will be obtained for these finite conductivity streamers .",
    "the results will be compared with the limiting cases of perfect conductivity , which is the lozansky - firsov model @xcite with a correction due to electron diffusion , and with the case of a perfect insulator , i.e the limit of very small conductivity . finally , we compare the results with an actual experiment for a positive streamer discharge .",
    "we start by introducing the model . taking a minimal set of balance equations to describe in fully a deterministic manner the discharge",
    "( see for example @xcite ) , we will derive the contour dynamics equations for the evolution of the interface between the plasma region and the gas region free of charge ( or with a very small density of charge ) .",
    "the outline of this derivation has already been reported @xcite but here we present it in full details . then , we proceed by studying a cylindrical discharge in the case of finite conductivity , and the analytical limits of infinite resistivity and ideal conductivity . with the model at hand we will predict some features of the stability of the fronts .",
    "numerical simulations are made to calculate the dispersion curves and test some of the analytical predictions .",
    "we briefly describe the numerical methods employed in the corresponding section .",
    "we end with an analysis of the results , the comparison with an experiment for a positive 2-d streamer discharge , and overview of possibilities that the model opens for more complicated geometries and fully 3d cases .",
    "in this section we obtain our model as a limit of a set of balance equations describing a streamer discharge .",
    "we will first recall the minimal description of a streamer discharge and some of the properties of the traveling planar fronts , and then make use of the asymptotic behaviour of those planar fronts in the limit of small diffusion to give a correction to the velocity of propagation of curved fronts . after finding the dynamics of the effective interface , a balance of the charge transport along the interface",
    "will be provided in order to complete the model .      for simulating the dynamical streamer development of streamers out of a macroscopic initial ionization seed , in a non - attaching gas like argon or nitrogen , the model of a streamer discharge @xcite can be simplified . as a first approach ,",
    "the processes with the smaller probabilities or cross sections can be ignored .",
    "attachment and recombination processes can be neglected on that basis in comparison with the ionization process for non - attaching gases .",
    "we also ignore photoionization processes in this work . with these considerations in mind ,",
    "the resulting balance equations are @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electron density , @xmath16 is the positive ion density , @xmath5 is the electron mobility and @xmath6 the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the ionization coefficient @xmath17 can be modeled following the phenomenological approximation suggested by townsend , which leads to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ionization length , and @xmath20 is the characteristic impact ionization electric field .",
    "the fitting of experimental data can be done using those parameters @xcite .",
    "note also that it is assumed the positive ions do not move and @xmath21 is the drift velocity of electrons .",
    "those are valid approximations at the initial stages of the streamers development , but it may not be right afterward . to close the model ,",
    "we consider gauss s law @xmath22    for convenience the equations are reduced to dimensionless form .",
    "townsend approximation provides physical scales and intrinsic parameters of the model if only impact ionization is present in the gas @xcite .",
    "the units are given by the ionization length @xmath9 , the characteristic impact ionization field @xmath23 , and the electron mobility @xmath5 .",
    "the velocity scale yields @xmath24 , and the time scale @xmath25 .",
    "typical values of these quantities for nitrogen at normal conditions are @xmath26 , @xmath27 kv / m , and @xmath28 .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 , the dimensionless field @xmath31 , the dimensionless electron and positive ion densities @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and the dimensionless diffusion constant @xmath35 . from now on , all the quantites will be dimensionless unless othewise stated .",
    "note however that we will not write the subindex @xmath36 .",
    "just for reference , the dimensionless model reads @xmath37      using the minimal streamer model , we can compute traveling wave solutions in the planar case .",
    "we will assume that the plasma region is on the left and the front is moving toward the right .",
    "the traveling waves are solutions such as @xmath38 and @xmath39 decay exponentially at infinity .",
    "this means that we can take @xmath40 asymptotically far ahead for the planar wave in the @xmath41 direction , being @xmath42 the value of the electric field at the infinity . introducing these expressions into the minimal model equations we get the relation @xmath43 which has real solutions if and only if @xmath44 all initial data decaying at infinity faster than @xmath45 , with @xmath46 , will develop traveling waves with velocity @xmath47 . clearly , from the assumption that the plasma state is on the left , negative velocity solutions are unphysical .",
    "so in the case of a negative front , when e@xmath48 is negative , the front will move at least with the drift velocity in the case that @xmath49 . for positive fronts ,",
    "the motion will be possible only if the creation of charge , given by the townsend factor , and its diffusion can compensate the drift .",
    "a detailed discussion about the propagation mechanism can be found at @xcite .",
    "if @xmath50 the profiles for @xmath39 and @xmath51 will vary very little from the profiles with @xmath49 and @xmath38 will develop a boundary layer at the front .",
    "this boundary layer has a width of @xmath52 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] .",
    "the main results for the structure of the boundary layer which we are going to make use are @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and @xmath55 the electric field in the @xmath41 direction .",
    "the function @xmath56 , also appearing in , is the solution of the equation @xmath57 which becomes the solution of a fisher equation under the additional assumptions that the townsend factor @xmath58 .",
    "so , as it is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] , the function @xmath59 changes from constant values in a region of width @xmath1 , when imposing the two maching conditions @xmath60 and @xmath61 , thus separating the plasma region from the gas .",
    "the complete mathematical details can be found in @xcite and @xcite .     at the boundary which has an effective width of order @xmath1 .",
    "the local coordinates tangent and normal to the surface , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , together with a pillbox are also shown schematically.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      next we will add the correction to the propagation velocity due to the curvature of the front .",
    "we take a level surface of @xmath38 representing the interface , and introduce local coordinates @xmath64 ( along the level surfaces of @xmath65 ) and @xmath63 ( orthogonal to the level surfaces of @xmath65 ) .",
    "the schematic can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] .",
    "we scale the normal coordinate with the boundary layer thickness @xmath66 , and expand the laplacian times @xmath2 like @xmath67where @xmath68 is the laplacian operator , @xmath69 is the transverse laplacian and @xmath8 is twice the mean curvature in 3-d or just the curvature in 2-d ( details of this expansion can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we write in local coordinates , and using , we find @xmath70finally we use so that @xmath71note that the curvature term correction will be relevant provided @xmath72 .",
    "thus we have obtained a transport equation for the electron density with velocity @xmath73 the level line @xmath38 which we have taken as representative of the interface evolution will move with a normal velocity @xmath74notice that the level lines concentrate in a small region where @xmath38 presents a jump from its bulk value to zero , so most level lines follow .",
    "the tangential component of the velocity will not change the geometry of the interface during its evolution , although tangential exchanges of charge affect the evolution through the dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath76 . the mathematical description of this effect will be the subject of next section .      in order to describe the charge transport along the interface",
    "we trace a small `` pillbox '' @xmath77 around a portion of the interface having the top and bottom areas bigger than the lateral area , i.e. @xmath78 as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] . on the other hand @xmath77",
    "will be big enough to contain the diffusive layer and so the portion where the total negative charge density @xmath79 has significant values different of zero .",
    "we subtract from and integrate over the pillbox volume @xmath80 , assume that @xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 for @xmath84 and get @xmath85_{\\chi = -\\infty } ^{\\infty } + o(d^{\\frac{1}{2 } } ) , % \\end{split } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\int_{\\mathcal{d } } ( n_{e}-n_{p})\\,dv = \\left .",

    "note that in the taylor - melcher model this assumption is also made .",
    "as explained in @xcite the left hand side of equation can be written as the time partial derivative of the product of the negative surface charge density @xmath0 times the normal area @xmath86 , and the change of a surface element can be related to the curvature times the normal velocity , so that @xmath87 if a charge source @xmath88 is present in the plasma , for instance at @xmath89 , this source will create a current density inside the plasma and we will have at the interior of @xmath90 @xmath91 by adding this contribution to we can finally write @xmath92where @xmath13 is the current density coming from the ionized region @xmath90 to its boundary @xmath93 in the normal direction @xmath63 , @xmath94 is the normal component of the electric field when approaching the interface from inside , and @xmath95 is the effective movility of the electrons inside the plasma .",
    "note that the quasineutrality of the plasma , further away of the interface is not changed by the current , but there is a jump in the normal component of the electric field across the interface given by @xmath96with @xmath4 the normal component of the electric field when approaching the interface from outside the plasma region .",
    "the eqs .   and together constitute the dynamical model able to describe the evolution of an interface separating a plasma region from a neutral region .",
    "notice that in the case @xmath97 , we arrive to lozansky - firsov model @xcite with a correction due to electron diffusion , meanwhile in the limit @xmath98 we arrive at the classical hele - shaw model .",
    "such a model is known to possess solutions that develop singularities in the form of cusps in finite time @xcite but , when regularized by surface tension corrections , the interface may develop various patterns including some of fractal - type ( see @xcite for a recent development and references therein ) .",
    "( [ sigmaeq ] ) will provide the surface charge density @xmath99 as a function of time . from it",
    ", we can compute the electric field and move the interface with ( [ bb1 ] ) .",
    "two limits can be easily identified in the case that there is no charge injection inside the plasma , i.e @xmath100 : a ) the limit of large conductivity@xmath101so that the interface is equipotential and b ) the limit of small conductivity@xmath102where the charge contained by a surface element is constant and the density only changes through deformation ( with change of area ) of the interface . in the next sections we will study the intermediate case of finite resistivity .",
    "as an application we will solve the 2-d case for different conductivities . in order to grasp some features of the model first we will consider how fronts with radial symmetry evolve .",
    "then we will study the stability of those fronts under small perturbations and finally solve the model numerically in order to test some of the analytical predictions .",
    "the electric potential created by a surface charge distribution with radial symmetry at the distance @xmath103 is found by solving the equation @xmath104 the fundamental solution turns out to be in polar coordinates @xmath105 where @xmath106 will be determined by the condition of the electric field jump at the surface . from the potential solution",

    "the origin of this prefactor was discussed for planar fronts in @xcite , and the dispersion relation for planar fronts was obtained in the case of constant charge in @xcite .",
    "we get in this 2-d curved case the same factor @xmath182 that we got for the planar case . on the other hand , imposing constant potential at the surface gives a factor of @xmath183 .",

    "the number is around 20 ( one has to extrapolate the number as the pictures do not show the whole discharge ) .",
    "this number is much closer to the lower limit as we pointed before , pointing in the direction that the electrons on the dielectric surface , when moving through the plasma , feel a much higher resistivity than in a conductor .",
    "although we do not expect to capture the whole physics of the discharge with the contour model , some essentials ingredients for the early development of the front seem to be well accounted by it .",
    "the theoretical prediction made in this section is a rather good one , despite all the approximations made and gives some insight about the parameters involved , such the mobility of the carriers , diffusion coefficient , number of fingers , and so no .",
    "we have presented the complete derivation of the contour dynamics moder electric discharges introduced in @xcite .",
    "the model appears as the leading asymptotic description for the minimal streamer model when the electron diffusion coefficient is very small .",
    "it consists of two integro - differential equations defined at the boundary of the plasma region : one for the motion of the points of the boundary where the velocity in the normal direction is given in terms of the electric field created by the net charge there , and a second equation for the evolution of the charge density at the boundary .",
    "this second equation is very similar to the taylor - melcher model in electrohydrodynamics @xcite . in the model",
    "the electric field is determined by solving poisson equation with a given surface charge density , leading to a singular integral of the density .",
    "once our model has been deduced , we have computed explicit solutions with cylindrical symmetry and investigated their stabilities .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation is such as the perturbation with the small mode number can grow exponentially fast . in fact , both the number of modes become unstable and the mode that becomes most unstable ( the one corresponding to the dispersion relation ) depends critically on the electric resistivity of the media .",
    "we have computed analytically the dispersion relation and found that the number of unstable modes grows with the inverse of the resistivity ( the conductivity ) and the most unstable mode also increases with it . in the limit of vanishing resistivity",
    "one can consider the medium as a perfect conductor and therefore impose that the potential is constant at the boundary .",
    "the dispersion relation for the model with finite resistivity converges to this limit when resistivity tends to zero .",
    "we have implemented a numerical procedure to solve our model in general situations . in order to develop the numerical method",
    ", we needed to evaluate certain singular integrals that appear when computing the electrical field .",
    "as one result of the numerical method , the dispersion relations have been computed and compared them with the analytical results . as a difference to our previous communication @xcite ,",
    "we have paid special attention to the effects of townsend expression for impact ionization on the dispersion relation and the cases of intermediate resistivities .",
    "finally , we have taken some experimental data from a positive surface streamer discharge and compare them with our model predictions .",
    "the number of fingers calculated from our model is of the same order of the observed one in the actual experiment .",
    "we have been able also to estimate the diffusion coefficient from the data .",
    "we have shown that the behaviour of the carriers inside the plasma is closer to the limit of high resistivity , so the importance of taking into account the plasma resistivity is made clear .",
    "thus , it is proved that our contour model is able to capture essential parts of the physics involved in the earlier development the streamer discharge , with an extra bonus : we can study more complex geometries and general situations both analytically and numerically .",
    "we are now in the process to complete the fully 3-d case and extend these results ."
