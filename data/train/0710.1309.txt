    "<S> the suppression of the density of states vanishes if the reflection symmetry is broken by displacing the interface ( yellow curve , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , displacement @xmath98 ) . ]    as expected , the suppression is sensitive to perturbations of the reflection symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> for example , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ simulation ] ( yellow curve ) , a displacement of the _ n - p _ interface by @xmath93 spoils the systematic destructive interference due to the berry phase , and thus eliminates the suppression of the _ global _ density of states .    </S>",
    "<S> we would still expect an effect on the _ local _ density of states if we could confine the carriers to the _ n - p _ interface . </S>",
    "<S> this might be achieved by means of the saddle point potential @xmath99 of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> because of disorder , the suppression will be limited to a mean free path or corrugation length from the _ n - p _ interface . </S>",
    "<S> since the predicted suppression of the density of states at the fermi level happens at a large energy separation @xmath101 from the dirac point ( see fig .  [ klein_tunneling ] ) , it should be distinguishable in a local measurement ( for example , by a tunneling probe ) from any features associated with the conical singularity in the band structure at the dirac point .    from a different perspective , the correspondence derived here offers the intriguing opportunity to observe superconducting analogies in non - electronic systems governed by the same dirac equation as graphene . </S>",
