    "the solution of the schrdinger equation is very important for the study of atoms and molecules .",
    "however the number of systems for which analytical solutions exist is very limited .",
    "this motivated the search for simplified models of these physical systems resulting in several studies on spherical potentials . despite such simplifications",
    "only few potentials have been analytically solved .",
    "besides , real physical systems , such as atoms and molecules , rarely exhibit simple spherical symmetry like that of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the study of non - central potentials began with the pioneering works of makarov @xcite and hartman @xcite , and was then properly structured with the work of hautot @xcite .",
    "their results paved the way for realistic applications of non - central - potential problems such as ring - shaped organic molecules which include , for instance , cyclic polyenes and benzene @xcite . since then there has been a significant interest in the literature in studies of non - central and ring - shaped potentials ( see for instance refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , as demonstrated by hautot @xcite , only few of these potentials in fact have analytical solutions , and they have thus been dominantly considered with either numerical technics or approximation methods .    owing to the emergence of graphene @xcite , two - dimensional systems have recently attracted a lot of interest in the domain of material sciences . for this reason",
    ", this paper is devoted to the analytical treatment of the dipole potential added to the coulomb potential @xmath5 for 2d systems .",
    "this potential , which we call non - pure dipole , is applicable to the case of an ionised dipolar molecule such as water .",
    "it has been considered in the case of three - dimensional systems by alhaidari using the approximation method of tri - diagonal matrices @xcite and by moumni et al using perturbation method @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the pure dipole potential @xmath6 in 3d has been widely studied both in nuclear and molecular physics @xcite ( see also references in @xcite ) , where it has been shown that the dipole moment must exceed a critical value in order to have bound states . on the other hand , in the case of molecular dipole or pure dipole potentials",
    ", the moment must be below a critical value in order for bound states to exist @xcite . for 2d systems ,",
    "the pure dipole was studied in refs . @xcite",
    "and it was found in ref @xcite that the critical dipole moment for bound states to exist is zero .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : np ] , we start by showing that this potential is the first non - central approximation when considering a non - zero charge distribution which is not spherically symmetric or when considering non - spherical ions .",
    "this potential is applicable for most physical systems excluding neutral molecules .",
    "we then solve the schrdinger equation for this potential , in section [ sec : sr ] , using the separation of variables .",
    "finally we conclude by discussing our results in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "our aim is to solve the schrdinger equation for a system consisting of a point charge @xmath7 under the effect of an extended charge @xmath8 ( a cluster of point charges @xmath9 ) .",
    "the latter is characterized by a non - zero total charge and a non - spherically - symmetric distribution .",
    "one can take as an example of this system a polar ion and a point charge .",
    "the potential produced by the charge distribution at the position of the test charge @xmath7 is written as follows @xmath10 here @xmath9 is the charge of the @xmath11 component of @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the position of the point charge @xmath7 relative to this component .",
    "we defined @xmath14 as the position of the charge @xmath7 ( also denoted by the vector @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 as that of @xmath17 ( defined by the vector @xmath18 ) relative to the origin @xmath19 , which we choose to coincide with the center of the charge @xmath12 .",
    "thus we write @xmath20^{-1/2}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\sum_j\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\,q_j\\left(\\vec{r}\\,^2 - 2\\,\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{a}_j+\\vec{a}_j^{\\,2}\\right)^{-1/2}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\sum_j\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\,\\frac{q_j}{r}\\left(1 - 2\\,\\frac{\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{a}_j}{\\vec{r}\\,^2 } + \\frac{\\vec{a}_j^{\\,2}}{\\vec{r}\\,^2}\\right)^{-1/2 } \\,.\\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we assume that the dimensions of the extended charge @xmath12 are small compared to those of the whole system constituted by @xmath12 and the point charge @xmath7 , such that we write @xmath21 , and thus we have @xmath22 taking into account these considerations and keeping only the terms up to order @xmath23 in the above expansion , one can easily write the potential as a multipolar expansion @xmath24 the first term in this expression is the coulomb interaction between the total charge @xmath12 and the point charge @xmath7 , or the monopole part , while the second is the effect of the geometry of the non - spherically - symmetric charge distribution @xmath12 , which represents a dipole part .",
    "we can simplify the dipole term by mapping the charge distribution @xmath12 into a single dipole whose poles are the two centers of all positive and negative charges contained within it .",
    "this leads to a dipole - ion potential , i.e. a non - pure dipole whose total charge is non - zero @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a characteristic distance of the dipole , @xmath27 is the angle between the position vector of @xmath7 relative to the center of the dipole and the axis of this dipole , and @xmath28 is the dipole moment .",
    "the stationary schrdinger equation reads @xmath29   \\psi = e\\psi\\,.\\label{7}\\ ] ] since we are working with a 2d system and referring to the shape of our potential , we use the polar coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and thus we write the wave equation as follows @xmath32\\psi = e\\psi\\,.\\label{8}\\ ] ] this expression may then easily be written in the separate form @xmath33   \\psi=-\\frac{2me}{\\hbar^{2}}\\psi\\,.\\label{9}\\ ] ] we use the separation of radial and polar variables to write the solution as @xmath34 , and to split the equation into two parts , angular and radial ones    @xmath35   r(r)&=-\\frac{2me}{\\hbar^{2}}r(r)\\ , .",
    "\\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this work , we use the same considerations as those for molecular systems : a positive extended charge and a negative point charge , which are equal in magnitude ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "the angular equation can easily be cast in the mathieu equation form @xcite , by making the substitutions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46 notice that since the period of @xmath27 is @xmath47 then that of @xmath48 is @xmath49 , and hence the solutions to eq .",
    "are just the cosine - elliptic @xmath50 and the sine - elliptic @xmath51 solutions of the mathieu equation , where @xmath52 is a natural number @xcite . according to floquet s theorem @xcite ( or bloch s theorem @xcite ) , for a given value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath53 , the solutions are periodic only for specific values of the parameter @xmath54 , which are known as the characteristic values .",
    "we denote these values corresponding to cosine solutions by @xmath54 and those related to sine functions by @xmath55 .",
    "looking at equations to one can see that , when the dipole effects disappear , i.e. , @xmath56 , our system has as a limiting behaviour the coulomb system .",
    "we therefore require that our solutions must tend to the coulomb solutions in this limit .",
    "this means that we must only keep the cosine solutions and discard the sine ones sine they are not valid solutions when @xmath57 for @xmath4 , where @xmath52 is the orbital quantum number , as we shall show later .",
    "in general there is no analytical expression for these solutions and they are usually given either numerically or graphically ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath58 for @xmath59 from bottom to top ( in a.u.).,scaledwidth=67.0% ]    however from these values one can extract the eigen - solutions of the angular equation which can then be used to obtain the radial ones .    referring to the expression of the dipole potential",
    ", we see that the dipole term is just a correction to the mono - polar term since it is just the latter multiplied by the factor @xmath60 . furthermore , since it depends on the dipole moment , then @xmath53 can be treated as a small parameter and one can write @xmath61 . in this limit ,",
    "the characteristic values have asymptotic analytical expressions which we write as a series in @xmath53 @xcite    @xmath62    for values of the index of @xmath63 greater than @xmath64 ( i.e. , for @xmath65 ) , one can use the same expression for both the @xmath54 s and the @xmath55 s , which include up to @xmath66 terms @xmath67 using the expressions of the characteristic values and the relations @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we get the eigenvalues @xmath42 as a function of the electric moment of the system @xmath1",
    "@xmath68    for @xmath65 we have @xmath69 we see that in the limit @xmath70 ( or @xmath57 ) , the mathieu equation has as solutions @xmath71 , with @xmath72 .",
    "thus the characteristic values can in all cases be written as @xmath73 similarly for the angular eigenvalues we have @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are polynomials which are written in terms of even powers of @xmath53 and @xmath1 starting from @xmath77 .",
    "next we use the expression of @xmath78 in order to solve the radial equation .",
    "we rewrite the radial equation in terms of @xmath79 as @xmath80r(r)=0\\,.\\label{21}\\ ] ] in order to simplify eq . into a class of known differential equations we use the following ansatz : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a constant to be determined . by means of the substitution ,",

    ", that for @xmath108 we have @xmath109 which leads to @xmath110 at infinity , we obtain the following general quantum condition @xmath111 and we get the discrete energy levels from the condition as follows @xmath112 we can relate these energies with the coulomb energy by using the relationship @xmath113 and the limit @xmath114 gives us @xmath115 which are the energies for the coulomb potential with @xmath116 , where we have the condition @xmath117 from the coulomb system @xcite .",
    "the final expression for the energy eigenvalues is @xmath118    the requirement that these energy eigenvalues @xmath2 be real necessitates that @xmath78 be negative , and thus from the relation @xmath119 the characteristic values must be positive .",
    "this gives us a condition on the parameter @xmath53 and therefore on the dipole moment @xmath1 from the definition @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , we conclude that in order for bound states @xmath2 to exist , it is necessary that the dipole moment @xmath1 not exceed a critical value determined by the equation @xmath120 .",

    "we gave the expressions of eigenenergies and eigenfunctions and we studied their dependence on to the dipole moment @xmath1 . as expected , our solutions tend to the coulomb ones when the dipole moment vanishes .",
    "the plots of the energies show that they increase with the dipole moment up to a maximum value and then start decreasing .",
    "the behavior of these solutions is similar to that of the characteristic values of the mathieu functions .",
