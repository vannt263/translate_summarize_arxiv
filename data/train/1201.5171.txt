    "the success of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics is seriously limited by the presence of a plethora of free parameters .",
    "an even more disturbing fact is that the best bet for physics beyond the sm namely the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , which is expected to bring us one step further towards a more fundamental understanding of nature , introduces around a hundred additional free parameters . to reduce the number of free parameters of a theory , and",
    "thus render it more predictive , one is usually led to introduce a symmetry .",
    "grand unified theories ( guts ) are very good examples of such a procedure @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of minimal @xmath1 , because of ( approximate ) gauge coupling unification , it was possible to reduce the gauge couplings by one and give a prediction for one of them .",
    "in fact , lep data @xcite seem to suggest that a further symmetry , namely @xmath7 global supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite should also be required to make the prediction viable . guts",
    "can also relate the yukawa couplings among themselves , again @xmath1 provided an example of this by predicting the ratio @xmath8 @xcite in the sm .",
    "unfortunately , requiring more gauge symmetry does not seem to help , since additional complications are introduced due to new degrees of freedom , in the ways and channels of breaking the symmetry , and so on .",
    "a natural extension of the gut idea is to find a way to relate the gauge and yukawa sectors of a theory , that is to achieve gauge - yukawa unification ( gyu ) @xcite .",
    "a symmetry which naturally relates the two sectors is supersymmetry , in particular @xmath9 susy @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that @xmath9 supersymmetric theories have serious phenomenological problems due to light mirror fermions .",
    "also in superstring theories and in composite models there exist relations among the gauge and yukawa couplings , but both kind of theories have phenomenological problems , which we are not going to address here .",
    "finite unified theories ( futs ) are @xmath7 supersymmetric grand unified theories ( guts ) which can be made finite to all - loop orders , including the soft supersymmetry breaking sector . the constructed _ finite unified _",
    "@xmath7 supersymmetric su(5 ) guts predicted correctly from the dimensionless sector ( gauge - yukawa unification ) , among others , the top quark mass @xcite .",
    "eventually , the full theories can be made all - loop finite and their predictive power is extended to the higgs sector and the s - spectrum @xcite . for a detailed discussion see @xcite .",
    "here we limit ourselves to a brief review .",
    "consider a chiral , anomaly free , @xmath7 globally supersymmetric gauge theory based on a group g with gauge coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "the superpotential of the theory is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( the mass terms ) and @xmath13 ( the yukawa couplings ) are gauge invariant tensors , and the matter field @xmath14 transforms according to the irreducible representation @xmath15 of the gauge group @xmath16 .",
    "all the one - loop @xmath17-functions of the theory vanish if the @xmath17-function of the gauge coupling @xmath18 , and the anomalous dimensions of the yukawa couplings @xmath19 , vanish , i.e. @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dynkin index of @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the quadratic casimir invariant of the adjoint representation of @xmath16 . a theorem given in @xcite then guarantees the vanishing of the @xmath17-functions to all - orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this requires that , in addition to the one - loop finiteness conditions ( [ 2 ] ) , the yukawa couplings are reduced in favour of the gauge coupling  @xcite .    in the soft breaking sector",
    ", the one- and two - loop finiteness for the trilinear terms @xmath24 can be achieved by @xcite h^ijk = -m c^ijk+  =-m",
    "^ijk_(0)g+o(g^5 )  .",
    "[ eq : hmc ] it was also found that the soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) scalar masses in gauge - yukawa and finite unified models satisfy a sum rule @xcite @xmath25 for i , j , k , where @xmath26 is the two - loop correction , which vanishes when all the soft scalar masses are the same at the unification point .",
    "we will examine here all - loop finite unified theories with @xmath1 gauge group , where the reduction of couplings has been applied to the third generation of quarks and leptons .",
    "an extension to three families , and the generation of quark mixing angles and masses in finite unified theories has been addressed in @xcite , where several examples are given .",
    "these extensions are not considered here .",
    "the particle content of the models we will study consists of the following supermultiplets : three ( @xmath27 ) , needed for each of the three generations of quarks and leptons , four ( @xmath28 ) and one @xmath29 considered as higgs supermultiplets .",
    "when the gauge group of the finite gut is broken the theory is no longer finite , and we will assume that we are left with the mssm .",
    "a predictive gauge - yukawa unified @xmath1 model which is finite to all orders , should have the following properties :    1 .",
    "one - loop anomalous dimensions are diagonal , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "2 .   three fermion generations , in the irreducible representations @xmath31 , which obviously should not couple to the adjoint @xmath29 .",
    "the two higgs doublets of the mssm should mostly be made out of a pair of higgs quintet and anti - quintet , which couple to the third generation .    in the following we discuss two versions of the all - order finite model .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which will be labeled @xmath32 , and a slight variation of this model ( labeled @xmath33 ) , which can also be obtained from the class of the models suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite with a modification to suppress non - diagonal anomalous dimensions .",
    "the superpotential which describes the two models takes the form @xcite w & = & _ i=1 ^ 3 [  g_i^u * 10*_i*10*_i h_i+ g_i^d*10*_i _ i _ i  ] + & + & g_23^u*10*_2 * 10*_3 h_4 + g_23^d*10*_2 _ 3_4 + g_32^d*10*_3 _ 2 _ 4 + & + & _",
    "a=1 ^ 4g_a^fh_a * 24*_a+ ( * 24*)^3  , [ zoup - super ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 stand for the higgs quintets and anti - quintets .",
    "the main difference between model @xmath32 and model @xmath33 is that two pairs of higgs quintets and anti - quintets couple to the @xmath36 in @xmath33 , so that it is not necessary to mix them with @xmath37 and @xmath38 in order to achieve the triplet - doublet splitting after the symmetry breaking of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , although the particle content is the same , the solutions to the finiteness equations and the sum rules are different , which will reflect in the phenomenology .    the non - degenerate and isolated solutions to @xmath39 for model * futa * , which are the boundary conditions for the yukawa couplings at the gut scale , are : & & ( g_1^u)^2 =  g^2  ,  ( g_1^d)^2 =  g^2  ,   ( g_2^u)^2=(g_3^u)^2=  g^2  , [ zoup - sol5 ] + & & ( g_2^d)^2 = ( g_3^d)^2=  g^2  ,   ( g_23^u)^2 = 0  ,   ( g_23^d)^2=(g_32^d)^2=0  , + & & ( g^)^2 = g^2  ,   ( g_2^f)^2 = ( g_3^f)^2=0  ,   ( g_1^f)^2=0  ,   ( g_4^f)^2= g^2  . in the dimensionful sector , the sum rule gives us the following boundary conditions at the gut scale for this model @xcite : m^2_h_u+ 2 m^2_*10 * & = & m^2_h_d+ m^2_+ m^2_*10*=m^2  , [ sumra ] and thus we are left with only three free parameters , namely @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    for the model * futb *  the non - degenerate and isolated solutions to @xmath39 give us : & & ( g_1^u)^2 =   g^2  ,  ( g_1^d)^2 =  g^2  ,   ( g_2^u)^2=(g_3^u)^2=  g^2  , [ zoup - sol52 ] + & & ( g_2^d)^2 = ( g_3^d)^2=  g^2  ,   ( g_23^u)^2 =  g^2  ,   ( g_23^d)^2=(g_32^d)^2=  g^2  , + & & ( g^)^2 = g^2  ,   ( g_2^f)^2 = ( g_3^f)^2=  g^2  ,   ( g_1^f)^2=0  ,   ( g_4^f)^2=0  , and from the sum rule we obtain : m^2_h_u+ 2 m^2_*10 * = m^2  ,   m^2_h_d-2m^2_*10*=-  , m^2_+ 3m^2_*10*=  , [ sumrb ] i.e. , in this case we have only two free parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we confront now the predictions of the four models , * futa *  and * futb * , each with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with the experimental data , starting with the heavy quark masses ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "since the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken below @xmath45 , the finiteness conditions do not restrict the renormalization properties at low energies , and all it remains are boundary conditions on the gauge and yukawa couplings ( [ zoup - sol5 ] ) , the @xmath46 relation eq.([eq : hmc ] ) , and the soft scalar - mass sum rule ( [ sumr ] ) at @xmath45 , as applied in each of the models .",
    "thus we examine the evolution of these parameters according to their rges up to two - loops for dimensionless parameters and at one - loop for dimensionful ones with the relevant boundary conditions .",
    "below @xmath45 their evolution is assumed to be governed by the mssm .",
    "we further assume a unique supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath47 and therefore below that scale the effective theory is just the sm .    as a first step ,",
    "we compare the predictions of the two models , * futa*and * futb *  ( both with @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , with the experimental values of the top and bottom quark masses .",
    "we use for the top quark the value for the pole mass @xcite  @xcite would have a minor impact on our analysis . ]",
    "m_t^exp = ( 173.1 1.3 )  gev  , where we notice that the theoretical values for @xmath50 may suffer from a correction of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "for the bottom quark mass we use the value at @xmath52 @xcite m_b(m_z ) = ( 2.83 0.10 )  gev to avoid uncertainties that come from the furhter running from the @xmath52 to the @xmath53 mass , and where we have taken the @xmath54 effects into account  @xcite .     as function of @xmath42 ( top ) and @xmath55 as function of @xmath42 ( bottom ) for models @xmath56 and @xmath57 , for @xmath58 and @xmath48.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] +   as function of @xmath42 ( top ) and @xmath55 as function of @xmath42 ( bottom ) for models @xmath56 and @xmath57 , for @xmath58 and @xmath48.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    from it is clear that the model * futb *  with @xmath49 is the only one where both top and bottom quark masses lie within experimental limits . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath59 is found to be @xmath60 .",
    "thus , we will concentrate now on the results for * futb * , @xmath43 .    in the case where all the soft scalar masses are universal at the unfication scale ,",
    "there is no region of @xmath42 below @xmath61(few  tev ) in which @xmath62 is satisfied ( where @xmath63 is the lightest @xmath64 mass , and @xmath65 the lightest neutralino mass ) .",
    "however , this problem can be solved naturally , thanks to the sum rule ( [ sumrb ] ) , see refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "a related problem concerns the agreement of our predictions with the cold dark matter constraints . again",
    "a detailed discussion can be found in refs .",

    "this way , we find a prediction for the lightest higgs mass and the susy spectra . from the analysis we find that the lightest observable particle ( losp ) is either the stau or the second lightest neutralino , with mass starting around @xmath71 gev .",

    "the lightest higgs mass ranges in m_h ~121 - 126  gev , [ eq : mhpred ] where the uncertainty comes from variations of the soft scalar masses , and from finite ( i.e.  not logarithmically divergent ) corrections in changing renormalization scheme . to this value",
    "one has to add @xmath72  gev coming from unknown higher order corrections  @xcite .",
    "we have also included a small variation , due to threshold corrections at the gut scale , of up to @xmath73 of the fut boundary conditions .",
    "thus , taking into account the @xmath68-physics constraints results naturally in a light higgs boson that not only fulfills the lep bounds  @xcite , but naturally falls in the range favored by recent atlas and cms measurements  @xcite .",
