    "in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the higgs field plays a central role in breaking the electroweak symmetry and giving masses to other elementary particles .",
    "a direct consequence is the existence of a spin-0 higgs boson that interacts with the other particles with strengths proportional to their respective masses .",
    "a new particle , denoted by @xmath1 , with mass about @xmath3 gev has been recently discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) by both the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite , and is found to be compatible with the sm higgs boson in the production rates of various channels .",
    "moreover , the diphoton decay of @xmath1 suggests that its spin is an even integer  @xcite , and a preliminary angular analysis of the @xmath4 decay data prefers that the new boson has zero spin and positive parity  @xcite .",
    "even though the new particle @xmath1 is generally consistent with the sm higgs boson , one obvious question is whether it is the only spin-0 particle in the sm or actually belongs to a larger scalar family .",
    "there are many well - motivated models with an extended higgs sector , among which the two - higgs doublet model ( thdm ) is one of the most popular and extensively analyzed classes .",
    "such a structure of two higgs doublet fields is also required for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . by introducing a cousin doublet of the sm higgs doublet",
    ", the model preserves the custodial symmetry in the kinetic term to keep the electroweak @xmath5 parameter at unity at tree level .",
    "recently , there are many analyses about the thdm s",
    "@xcite , with particular emphasis on the study of enhancement in the @xmath6 mode as the data show . a survey of generic models with an extended higgs sector , including the thdm s , has been done by the authors  @xcite to show the correlation between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 modes .",
    "obviously , a global analysis to the available data is required to disentangle among the possible new physics candidates  @xcite .",
    "various scenarios in the thdm have been analyzed by using the higgs boson search data at the lhc before the moriond conference  @xcite , and those afterwards  @xcite .    in the thdm s",
    ", there may be tree - level flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions due to the mediations of neutral scalar bosons as both doublet fields can generally couple to the up - type and down - type quarks and charged leptons .",
    "there are several ways to avoid such dangerous fcnc processes , _",
    "e.g. _ , imposing a softly broken @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite symmetry is known as the inert doublet model  @xcite . ] or assuming alignments in the yukawa matrices  @xcite . in the former case , there are four independent types of yukawa interactions , depending on the charge assignments of the sm fermions under the @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite . they are dubbed the type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y thdm s  @xcite .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , all these scenarios contain the same physical higgs bosons under the assumption of cp conservation in the higgs sector : two charged higgs bosons , two cp - even higgs bosons , and one cp - odd higgs boson .",
    "the type - ii thdm can best fit the latest higgs search data from the lhc , with the preferred values @xmath9 where @xmath2 is defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) of the two doublet fields and sm - like couplings among the lighter cp - even higgs boson and weak gauge bosons @xmath10  @xcite . however , we find that there is another parameter region that can not be ruled out by the data at even @xmath11 confidence level ( cl ) and is still consistent with the constraints of vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity .",
    "this region corresponds to the case where the deviation in the @xmath10 coupling is more than @xmath12 from its sm value , and the values of the tau and bottom yukawa couplings are slightly smaller in magnitude and have the opposite sign to their sm values .",
    "although the higgs boson signal are still sm - like , such a case has effects on the productions and decays of the other higgs bosons at colliders . in this paper , we study the higgs phenomenology at the lhc in this part of the parameter space .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : thdm ] , we review the thdm with a @xmath0 symmetry and classify four types of higgs interactions with sm fermions . a soft @xmath0 symmetry breaking term is also introduced . in section  [ sec : fit ] , we perform @xmath13 fits of the four scenarios to the current data , singling out the type - ii interactions as the preferred one .",
    "we then find two separate regions in the model parameter space , noting that one of them has been ignored in previous analyses .",
    "we then concentrate on the region where the @xmath10 couplings have larger deviations from the sm expectations , and study the collider phenomenology of the heavier higgs bosons in section  [ sec : pheno ] . after working out the branching fractions of both heavy cp - even higgs boson , @xmath14 , and cp - odd higgs boson , @xmath15",
    ", we examine their single and pair productions at the lhc and compare the results with current search limits .",
    "our findings are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the thdm contains two @xmath16 doublet higgs fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 with hypercharge @xmath19 . in general",
    ", both doublet fields can couple to the sm fermions at the same time and induce fcnc s via the mediation of a scalar boson at tree level .",
    "to avoid such fcnc s , a softly broken discrete @xmath0 symmetry is introduced to the model , under which the doublet fields transform as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    ".charge assignments of the @xmath0 symmetry and the corresponding @xmath22 factors in different scenarios of the thdm . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now briefly comment on the higgs phenomenology in the other parameter region preferred by the lhc data , _",
    "i.e. _ , the region with @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ contours ] . in that case , the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 couplings are much suppressed , and the decay branching fractions of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are negligible . instead of such gauge boson",
    "associate decay modes , these heavy higgs bosons mainly decay into fermion pairs whose pattern depends on the type of yukawa interactions , the masses of the extra higgs bosons , and @xmath2 . for example",
    ", @xmath14 and @xmath15 can decay dominantly into @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) for large @xmath2 in the type - i , type - ii and type - y ( type - x ) thdm when the masses of both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , the main decay mode of @xmath33 can be @xmath34 ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) for large @xmath2 in the type - i , type - ii and type - x ( type - y ) thdm when the charged higgs boson mass is smaller than the top quark mass  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have considered the two - higgs doublet models ( thdm s ) with softly broken @xmath0 symmetry introduced to avoid flavor - changing neutral currents at the tree level and the four independent scenarios ( type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y ) differing in the yukawa interactions .",
    "we have scanned the parameter regions that can explain the current higgs boson search data recently reported by the atlas and cms collaborations .",
    "we have found that the type - ii thdm can best explain the data among all , with two separate parameter regions on the @xmath2-@xmath37 plane at the 68% cl .",
    "one region has smaller @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , and the other implies the relations @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the latter case , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , is ignored in previous analyses . based on this finding ,",
    "we have then studied the phenomenology of the extra higgs bosons in this region .",
    "the heavy cp - even higgs boson primarily decays into a pair of @xmath43 and @xmath44 bosons , different from the corresponding particle in the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "the cp - odd higgs boson mainly decays to the sm - like higgs and @xmath44 bosons , and the charged higgs boson to the sm - like higgs and @xmath43 bosons or a pair of top and bottom quarks .",
    "we have also computed the cross sections of various signal and background events for the production of the extra higgs bosons .",

    "nsc-100 - 2628-m-008 - 003-my4 and nsc-101 - 2811-m-008 - 014 .",
    "while this manuscript was being written up , we noticed the appearance of ref .",
    "@xcite in which a global fit to the higgs boson search data at the lhc was discussed for various thdm s , including the softly broken @xmath0 symmetric thdm s considered in this work .",
