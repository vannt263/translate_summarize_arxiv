    "at any beach with flat or nearly flat bottom , one often observes interesting wave patterns as shown in figure [ fig : f120015 ] . in this paper",
    ", we provide a mathematical analysis for those patterns ( non - stationary in general ) based on the kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) equation @xcite which is given by @xmath0 here @xmath1 represents the normalized wave amplitude at the point @xmath2 in the @xmath3-plane for fixed time @xmath4 .         from a physical perspective",
    ", the kp equation is derived from the three - dimensional euler equations for an irrotational and incompressible fluid under the assumptions that it describes the propagation of small amplitude , long wavelength , uni - directional waves with small transverse variation ( i.e. , quasi - two - dimensional waves ) .",
    "an example of such wave phenomena observed in nature is the surface wave patterns in shallow water on long , flat beaches as shown in figure  [ fig : f120015 ] . on a smaller scale ,",
    "such wave patterns can be easily demonstrated in table - top experiments  @xcite ( see also movies available at the website http://www.needs-conferences.net/2009/ ) , as well as recreated in more accurate water tank experiments in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the kp equation admits an important class of solitary wave solutions that are regular , non - decaying and localized along distinct lines in the @xmath3-plane .",
    "these are known as the line - soliton solutions which have been studied extensively in recent years by the authors who have provided a complete classification of these solutions using geometric and combinatorial techniques  @xcite . in principle",
    ", these solutions may have arbitrary number of asymptotic line solitons in the far - field and a complex interaction pattern of intermediate solitons resembling a web - like structure in the near - field region .",
    "because of this , we sometimes call the line - soliton solutions the _ web - solitons_. several simple yet exact web - solitons , for example , the y - shape soliton and several other solutions with two asymptotic solitons for @xmath5 , have been experimentally demonstrated . indeed , in recent laboratory wave tank experiments by harry yeh s group at oregon state university surface wave patterns generated by solitary wave interactions which are very good approximations of the exact kp solutions ,",
    "have been observed  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this note is to study the _ inverse problem _ , i.e. , to construct an exact line - soliton solution of the kp equation that approximates an observed wave pattern .",
    "specifically , we consider the wave patterns observed in shallow water such as in figure [ fig : f120015 ] .",
    "we assume that these patterns satisfy the assumptions stated above , necessary to derive the kp equation from the euler equations .",
    "then the inverse problem determines the information required to construct the exact line - soliton solution from the wave pattern data consisting of the amplitude and slopes of the solitary waves , and the locations of those waves on the @xmath3-plane for fixed @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize at the very outset that in this note we limit our considerations only to the comparison between the wave patterns and the exact kp theory , that is , we do not take into account any higher order corrections to the kp equation due to large amplitude , finite angle ( departure from quasi - two - dimensionality ) , uneven bottom or any such physical perturbations . in this sense , the inverse problem considered here should be regarded as a leading order approximation .",
    "recent interest in the study of line - soliton solutions of the kp equation has generated a data bank of photographs and video recordings of patterns formed by interacting small amplitude solitary waves in shallow water on flat beaches , see for example , a recent article by ablowitz and baldwin  @xcite and additional resources at the authors websites  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose an algorithm to construct the line - soliton solutions approximating those given wave patterns .",
    "modeling of shallow water wave patterns by the line - soliton solutions are carried out in a `` qualitative '' fashion in the current literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and at times , using ad hoc methods .",
    "most such studies consider the kp @xmath6-soliton solutions given by the well - known hirota formula  @xcite .",
    "but even for @xmath7 , this formula is not adequate to describe the rich variety of similar interaction patterns revealed by the kp theory  @xcite since the 2-soliton solution obtained from the hirota formula only gives a _ stationary _ x - shape pattern .",
    "in contrast , our algorithm makes concrete _ quantitative _ use of the measurements from a given wave pattern to obtain the explicit analytical form of the kp line - soliton solution which can describe the non - stationary dynamics of the pattern .",
    "it is important to recognize that the resonant interaction among solitary waves plays a fundamental role in the formation of surface wave patterns that can be approximated by the kp solitons .",
    "it was miles  @xcite who first identified the resonant interaction in kp solitons when two asymptotic line solitons of an x - shape 2-soliton solution , referred here as the x - soliton , interact obliquely at a certain critical angle , and a third soliton is created to make a y - shape pattern .",
    "it turns out that such y - shape wave - form is an exact solution of the kp equation , and is referred to as y - soliton ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , more general type of resonant and partially - resonant line - soliton solutions have been discovered ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in this paper , we demonstrate using explicit examples of shallow water wave patterns that the resonant line - soliton solutions of the kp equation can be used to approximate such patterns and their dynamics fairly well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we provide some basic background for the one - soliton solution of the kp equation , as well as the resonant y - soliton and the non - resonant x - soliton solutions .",
    "then in section 3 we describe an algorithmic method to construct an exact kp soliton solution from a given wave pattern . in section 4",
    ", we illustrate our algorithm via several explicit examples of actual shallow water wave patterns , and demonstrate that the dynamics given by the exact solutions are in good agreement with the observations .",
    "we finally give some concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "here we briefly give the background information on the kp solitons necessary to this paper and a remark on some particular solutions ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "it is customary to prescribe the solutions of the kp equation as @xmath8 in terms of the @xmath9-function @xmath10 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for the soliton solutions ,",
    "the @xmath9-function is defined via    * @xmath11 distinct real parameters @xmath12 with the ordering @xmath13 , and * an @xmath14 real matrix @xmath15 of full rank with @xmath16 .",

    ", the matrix @xmath15 is called a _ totally non - negative _ matrix .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the general soliton solution given by equations and consists of @xmath6 line - solitons as @xmath31 and @xmath32 line - solitons as @xmath33 .",
    "each of those asymptotic solitons is uniquely parametrized by a pair of distinct @xmath34-parameters @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",

    "the map @xmath38 turns out to be fixed - point free permutation of the index set @xmath18 $ ] known as _",
    "derangement _ which is conveniently represented by a chord diagram as shown in examples below .",
    "thus the soliton solution generated by the @xmath9-function is represented by the chord diagram associated to the derangement @xmath38 .",
    "we briefly describe below some details of the one - solitons , the y - solitons and the x - solitons which form the building blocks of a web - soliton solution of the kp equation .",
    "those one- , y- and x - solitons are stationary solutions of the kp equation .",

    "the scaling for the kp equation is given by the parameter @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the wave amplitude , @xmath108 is the water depth , @xmath109 is the wavelength and @xmath110 is the slope of the soliton .",
    "the typical value of @xmath111 in real physical situation ranges from @xmath112 to @xmath113 .",

    "in other words , the wave pattern having a long stem does not correspond to an x - soliton of the kp equation .",
    "for example , the wave pattern in figure [ fig : stem](a ) shows an x - type interaction , while the wave pattern in figure [ fig : stem](b ) is not of x - type , and the stem appearing in the middle of figure [ fig : stem](b ) is an intermediate solitary wave which interact resonantly with other two solitons at the trivalent vertices .",

    ", the x - vertex degenerates to a y - vertex as the two solitons interact resonantly and generate a third soliton , called the mach stem  @xcite .",
    "one can also compute the maximum amplitude occurring at the mid - point of the interaction , and it is given by @xcite @xmath124 then at the critical angle @xmath125 , the maximum amplitude can reach four times of the solitons .",
    "this interaction phenomena is referred to as the mach reflection which has important application in the study of rogue waves .",
    "a recent study on the mach reflection for kp solitons can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was found in  @xcite that the line - soliton solution of type @xmath126 can be used to describe the non - stationary wave patterns generated by the mach reflection for the cases with @xmath127 , where the x - soliton becomes singular ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a general line - soliton solution of the kp equation can be regarded as a collection of one - solitons and y - solitons which fit together to form a web - structure with x- and y - vertices in the interaction region as shown in figure  [ fig:33soliton ] .",
    "an alternate combinatorial description of this solution can be obtained by gluing the local chord diagrams corresponding to those component one - solitons and y - solitons and to form the complete chord diagram for the derangement @xmath38 associated with the general soliton solution .",
    "we will implement this technique of `` gluing '' of chords in the next section in order to reconstruct a kp soliton solution from a _ real _ wave pattern and will illustrate this method with explicit examples .",
    "in this section we discuss the problem of constructing an exact soliton solution of the kp equation from a given wave pattern satisfying the assumptions required to derive the kp equation .",
    "in other words , the pattern should describe interactions of small amplitude , quasi - two - dimensional waves of long wavelength traveling in one direction .",
    "here we consider the surface wave patterns on shallow water observed in long , flat stretches of ocean beaches",
    ". provided that the wave pattern approximates a kp soliton solution , we assume that each component wave in the pattern approximates a @xmath37$]-soliton for some index pair @xmath128 .",
    "then the construction procedure consists of the following steps :    1 .",

    "5 .   using , find the matrix elements of @xmath15 from the minors @xmath23 by measuring the locations of the solitary waves in the pattern .",
    "we remark that if there are resonances in the wave pattern , it is sufficient to measure the amplitudes , or slopes or locations of only a subset of the solitary wave forms in the pattern , rather than the entire set .",
    "the wave patterns that we consider for the inverse problem are assumed to be _ generic _ in the sense that the topological structure of the pattern remains the same over a finite period of time .",
    "that is , the number of x- and y - vertices in the pattern remains the same over a certain time period .",
    "if a generic wave pattern contains a line soliton which interacts non - resonantly with all other waves ( i.e. the interactions make only x - vertices ) , then it can be treated as a separate @xmath37$]-soliton in the sense that its chord - diagram ( see figure  [ fig:1soliton ] ) is disjoint ( non - crossing ) from the chord diagram of the remaining pattern .",
    "it is for this reason we only consider wave patterns where each line soliton is incident on _ at least _",
    "one trivalent vertex .",
    "that is , each line soliton interacts resonantly with two other line solitons forming a y - vertex .    in this note",
    ", we primarily consider wave patterns with only _ two _ trivalent vertices consisting of two y - type ( one y - shape and other -shape ) waves which have a common intermediate solitary wave .",
    "we distinguish the y - type waves by marking their trivalent vertices , in particular , we assign a white vertex for the -shape wave , and a black vertex for the y - shape wave . identifying the common intermediate wave from each y - shape wave , one can see that there are 5 distinct cases for such wave pattern as shown in figure  [ fig:2res2 ] .",
    "the resonant vertices in each of these patterns are labeled @xmath129 ( upper vertex ) and @xmath130 ( lower vertex ) .",
    "the solitary waves incident at the vertex @xmath129 are numbered as 1 , 2 and 3 , while the solitary waves numbered as 3 , 4 and 5 are incident at the vertex @xmath130 .",
    "thus each pattern consists of two y - type waves glued together by the common solitary wave 3 joining vertices @xmath129 and @xmath130 . besides serving as simple examples to illustrate our method ,",
    "these patterns are observed fairly regularly in flat ocean beaches .",
    "however , such wave patterns _ can not _ be modeled by hirota s 2-soliton formula which gives a stationary pattern , and contains only one free parameter determining the phase shift due to non - resonant interaction of the @xmath131-soliton described in section  [ sec : x ] .",
    "the exact line - soliton solutions corresponding to these resonant wave patterns are _ non_-stationary and contain more than one free parameters ( a complete classification of the line - soliton solutions corresponding to those patterns in figure [ fig:2res2 ] is given in @xcite ) .    in order to construct kp solitons from those patterns",

    "the slope of each solitary wave in the observation is the same as that used in the kp equation .",
    "for this reason , we determine the @xmath34-parameters from the slope measurements only .    in",
    "what follows , we provide a step by step algorithm to reconstruct the exact kp soliton solution from a given wave pattern with two trivalent resonant vertices .      for specificity",

    "let us describe the evolution of the exact solution in figure [ fig : markor ] in more details .",

    "this solution has three y - vertices and one x - vertex ( these are more clear in the second and third frames ) .",
    "the solitons @xmath158 $ ] and @xmath196 $ ] interact at the rightmost ( @xmath199 ) y - vertex to form a large amplitude stem @xmath200$]-soliton which is visible in both photographs in figure [ fig : f120015 ] but more pronounced in the right photograph .",
    "this clearly suggests that the @xmath200$]-soliton is not a phase shift since it is a non - stationary stem arising from a resonant interaction of the solitons @xmath158 $ ] and @xmath196 $ ] from the right ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "this @xmath200$]-soliton interacts resonantly with the @xmath197$]-soliton coming from the left ( @xmath33 ) at the second y - vertex to form a small amplitude @xmath156$]-soliton which is barely discernible in the first frame as well as the wave pattern photograph in figure [ fig : f120015 ] .",
    "but as the pattern evolves the @xmath156$]-soliton is clearly visible in the second , third and fourth frames in figure [ fig : markor ] as well as the right photograph of the wave pattern in figure [ fig : f120015 ] taken at @xmath189 .",
    "again , this clearly shows that the length of the @xmath156$]-soliton grows with time .",
    "the @xmath156$]-soliton intersects with the @xmath99$]-soliton on the right ( @xmath31 ) and the large amplitude asymptotic @xmath157$]-soliton on the left ( @xmath33 ) at the third y - junction ( seen on the left , in the second and third frames ) to form a resonant triplet .    ,",
    "in this note we described an explicit algorithm to construct an exact solution of the kp equation approximating a given pattern of small amplitude , long wavelength and primarily unidirectional shallow water waves .",
    "this can be regarded as an  inverse problem \" in the sense that by measuring some metric data such as the angles and locations of the solitary waves in the given pattern with respect to a fixed reference frame , it is possible to determine the data necessary to construct the @xmath9-function associated with a kp line - soliton solution .",
    "we have illustrated our method by applying it to photographs and videos of real wave patterns .",
    "the constructed exact solutions compare fairly well with the snapshots ( at a fixed @xmath4 ) but more importantly we have shown that their time evolution is also in good agreement with the dynamics of these non - stationary patterns .",
    "these exact solutions of the kp equation found in sections 3 and 4 were derived and classified in previous works by the authors , and they can not be obtained from a simple hirota @xmath6-soliton formula .",
    "an important feature of this algorithm is that one can directly read off the parameters for the exact soliton solution from the wave pattern data without resorting to any ad hoc techniques to `` guess '' the soliton parameters from the wave pattern .",
    "one could also incorporate the measurement of amplitudes of the wave forms in the algorithm although the measurement of the slopes are generally more accurate than that of the amplitudes of the wave forms in the pattern .",
    "the possible inaccuracies in amplitude measurement are due to , for example , the breaking of the waves and the higher order corrections to the leading order kp equation .",
    "moreover , it is difficult ( if not impossible ) to measure the amplitudes if one were to use a photograph ( or a video ) of the wave pattern .",
    "the slopes of the line solitons should be measured at a vertex ( intersection points of the interacting solitons ) , since the solitary wave form may not be exactly a straight - line e.g. , due to non - constant depth of water on a beach .",
    "our algorithm can be extended in principle to a wave pattern with arbitrary number of solitary waves for @xmath31 and @xmath33 although such patterns may be unstable and break up shortly after it is formed due to external perturbations .",
