    "according observation data from wmap , universe accelerated expanding at the current epoch [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] .",
    "these astrophysical observations also show that the universe is spatially , and is composed of about @xmath0 of dark matter , and @xmath1 of homogeneously distributed new type of negative pressure matter , known as dark energy , that lead to the current accelerated expansion in universe . from another view point ,",
    "theories of extra dimensions , in which the observed universe is realized as a brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime , have attracted some attentions .",
    "particularly , the model proposed by dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) [ 6,7,8 ] is different from others . in this",
    "regard , dgp model also predicts deviations from the standard 4-dimensional gravity in over large distances .",
    "however , impact of lorentz invariance violating models ( liv ) on cosmology has been studied in [ 9,10,11 ] .",
    "this models has been used in the context of scalar - vector - tensor theories [ 9,11 ] .",
    "one important observation has been made in reference [ 11,12 ] which considered accelerated expansion and crossing of phantom divide line with one minimally coupled scalar field in the attendance of a lorentz invariance violating vector field . as one has shown in [ 13 ] , quintessence model with a single minimally coupled scalar field has not the capability to describe crossing of phantom divide line , @xmath2 .",
    "but , a single non - minimally coupled scalar field is suitable to cross the phantom divide line [ 14 ] .    in following , we study a new method of performing local lorentz violation in a gravitational setup to make the existence of a tensor field with a non - vanishing expectation value , and then add this tensor to gravity or matter and scalar fields .",
    "the example of this approach is to used a single time - like vector field with unit norm .",
    "this vector field choose a preferred frame at each point in space - time and a matter field coupled to it will endure a violation of local lorentz invariance .",
    "a method of this model was introduced kostelecky and samuel in [ 15 ] . here",
    "we choose the vector to have dynamics , and fixed norm in the action .",
    "our procedure in this paper is deriving the basic equations of motion for the most general theory of a time - like vector field @xmath3 with an action @xmath4 where @xmath5 [ 11 ] . then with numerical calculations , we study some cosmological aspects in this model in present the vector field in our formalism . in this regard , we study other solutions admitted as rip singularity , that occur in the condition @xmath6 increases rapidly .",
    "however , it possible different types of singularity , depending energy density and scale factor how increases with time[16 - 19,31 - 36 ] . in",
    "following we just focus on big or little singularity and other cases of singularity maybe appear in this model with tuning parameters space .",
    "as we shown in[11 ] , for study lorentz violation , we assume a vector @xmath3 in the extra dimension .",
    "so , this local frame at space - time is unavoidably selected as the preferred frame .",
    "however the action of the lorentz violating dgp scenario in the presence of a minimally coupled scaler field and vector field on the brane can be written as the sum of two separate parts @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath5 are @xmath9 @xmath10-\\frac{1}{2 } q^{\\mu\\nu } \\nabla_{\\mu}\\phi\\nabla_{\\nu}\\phi -v(\\phi ) + m^{3}_{4}\\overline{k}+ { \\cal{l}}_{m}+\\ ] ] @xmath11\\bigg)\\bigg]_{y=0}.\\ ] ] @xmath12 is coordinate of the fifth dimension , @xmath13 point to the constant in the bulk and @xmath14 used for brane , for more details see [ 11 ] .",
    "we consider brane is located at @xmath15.@xmath16 is five dimensional bulk metric with ricci scalar @xmath17 , also @xmath18 is induced metric on the brane with induced ricci scalar @xmath19 . @xmath16 and @xmath18 are connected via @xmath20 .",
    "this action is suitable for add any non - gravitational degrees of freedom in the model of lorentz violating scalar - tensor - vector theory . in other hand , we take @xmath21 and the expectation value of vector field @xmath3 is @xmath22[20 ] . @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are temporary parameters with dimension of mass squared,@xmath25 is also a lagrange multiplier field .",
    "note that @xmath26 are mass scale of violating lorentz invariance [ 9,20,21 ] . + a motivation for choosing the vector action in term ( 3 ) discussed in ref .",
    "also cosmological consequences of this action are studied in ref.[9,11,21 ] .",
    "+ in the action ( 3 ) ordinary matter part is shown by lagrangian @xmath27 where @xmath28 is matter field and its energy - momentum tensor is[22 ] @xmath29 the scalar field lagrangian , @xmath30 , gives the following energy - momentum tensor @xmath31 the energy - momentum tensor of vector field also is by usual formulate @xmath32 the bulk - brane einstein s equations obtained from action ( 1 ) are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is 4-dimensional(brane ) dalembertian and @xmath35 .",
    "+ from equation ( 7 ) we find @xmath36 and @xmath37 for bulk and brane respectively .",
    "we use the following line element to derive cosmological equations of our model @xmath38 we use @xmath39 and @xmath40 after the variation [ 11 ] .",
    "+ now we can obtain components of the total energy - momentum tensor as follow @xmath41 and @xmath42 here we take the energy - momentum tensor for the matter as a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath43 and pressure @xmath44 is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a unit time - like vector field illustrate the fluid four - velocity .",
    "we also assume a usual equation of state for the fluid as @xmath47 that @xmath48 .",
    "energy density and pressure of minimally coupled scalar field are taken as @xmath49_{y=0},\\ ] ] and @xmath50_{y=0},\\ ] ] where a dot point to the derivative respect to cosmic time @xmath51 .",
    "the stress - energy for the vector field also assume the form of a perfect fluid , with an energy density determined by [ 10 ] @xmath52 and a pressure @xmath53\\ ] ] where we have assume the parameter @xmath54 and @xmath55 is hubble parameter . in the absence of vector field ,",
    "all @xmath56 , in following , we stress for obtain equation of state in general case one should varying the action ( 1 ) , that it has been calculated in ref[9,10 11,12,15,20 , 21 and 22 ] . here",
    "we just used their results and summarized calculations .",
    "hence , we write the general equation of state which takes the following form @xmath57 + \\frac{1}{2n^{2}}\\dot{\\phi}^{2}-v(\\phi)}{\\rho_m-3\\beta h^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\phi}^{2}+n^{2}v(\\phi)}\\big]_{y=0}\\ ] ] and for obtain generalized friedmann equations , we use the effective einstein equation ( for more details see[11,23 ] ) , therefore we have @xmath58^{2}.\\ ] ] as we calculated in above equations , there are many parameters , so we expect the lorentz violating brane model , suitable for study the current stage acceleration of the universe and other cosmological aspects with fine tuning parameters .",
    "in following , we consider scalar equation of state @xmath59 which is a candidate for the dark energy in future discussions . in this regard ,",
    "the equation of state parameter on the brane given by @xmath60_{y=0}\\ ] ] now we obtain scalar field of equation of state in two ways .",
    "first , we have friedmann equation from equation ( 18 ) as @xmath61^{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and we assume non matter contain on the model that means @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath67 as an integration constant[23 ] . then we obtain dynamic of scalar field from above equation @xmath68 where @xmath69 has main role in next calculations . for determine dynamic of scalar field",
    ", we use to a well - known potential : models with potential of the form @xmath70[24 ] .",
    "second , such as we see equation ( 21 ) depend on potential functions , therefore we will obtain the scalar field of equation of state in our model that independent of potentials .",
    "so the energy equation for vector field taken as @xmath71 and for the scalar field @xmath72 the total energy equation in presence of both the vector and the scalar fields is @xmath73 now we obtain dynamic of scalar field by differentiating equation ( 13 ) with respect to @xmath51 and using equation ( 23 ) then we have @xmath74 and by differentiating equation ( 20 ) with respect to @xmath51 and using equation ( 25 ) we have @xmath75 where we assume @xmath76 and @xmath77 depended on @xmath78 . for simplicity in following",
    "we take @xmath79 .",
    "+ in other hand , with substituting equation ( 26 ) into the friedmann equation ( 20 ) obtain the potential of the scalar field as @xmath80 and @xmath81 also factor @xmath82 from equation ( 26 ) give as @xmath83 @xmath84{\\big ( {   10h_{,\\phi}+{4}+{4}\\beta h_{,\\phi}+{5}\\beta_{,\\phi}+{4 } \\beta_{,\\phi}\\beta+{80}\\beta h+a}\\big)}}{h}\\ ] ] @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 1 .",
    "we emphasize that equation ( 26 ) have several solutions , here we choose a real solution of them .",
    "besides , equation ( 29 ) has not the analytical solution that we exactly use it for cosmological consideration . hence , we just study some phenomenological aspects from figure 1 and choose a best fit scalar filed with equation ( 29 ) for analytical consideration .",
    "+ in follows , we calculate scalar field of equation of state with using equation ( 20 ) .",
    "therefore we have two equations for @xmath88 as @xmath89 and @xmath90 for each branch of @xmath88 means equation ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) with using equation ( 23 ) we obtain equation @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 and @xmath94    @xmath95    where @xmath96",
    ". we can calculate @xmath97 after simplify from equation ( 32 ) as    @xmath98    @xmath99    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103 \\bigg[\\left ( { { m_4}}^{3}+{\\epsilon_2}\\,\\sqrt { { \\frac { { { m_4}}^{9}+{h}^{2 } \\left ( \\beta+{{m_3}}^{2 } \\right ) ^{2 } { { m_4}}^{3}+2\\,h{\\epsilon_4}\\ , \\left ( \\beta+{{m_3}}^{2 } \\right ) } { { { m_4}}^{3 } } } } \\right)^{-1}\\ ] ]    @xmath104\\ ] ]    in following we study our models by using above equations for obtain some constraint of parameters that be according to observation data and also discuss about other cosmological aspects .",
    "in this section we consider our equation that obtained in above section for determine some cosmological aspects .",
    "therefore we need to solve equation ( 36 ) to study crossing of phantom divide barrier @xmath97 in model . in first stage",
    "we should obtain dynamics of scalar field @xmath78 with equation ( 21 ) .",
    "this will be achieved only if the hubble parameter @xmath105 and the vector field coupling , @xmath106 are known .",
    "hence , our strategy is to choose some cases of the hubble parameter @xmath105 and the vector field coupling @xmath107 for considering possible crossing of phantom divide barrier ( pdl ) and rip singularity in this model .",
    "also we should obtain suitable domains of parameter space which have the capability to explain rip singularity and crossing of phantom divide line by equation of state parameter .    in following ,",
    "we take a general case of the vector field coupling and the hubble parameter that are functions of scalar field @xmath78    @xmath108    where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are positive constant parameters . here",
    "we used anzats ( 37 ) because considered some cases of the solution and verified the stability in previous works [ 12 ] .",
    "also other authors [ 10 and references therein ] have been used anzats ( 37 ) for some cosmological solutions , for example , late time acceleration , deceleration parameters and etc .",
    "so let us using equation ( 21 ) for obtain dynamic of scalar field equation with assuming case ( 37 ) as @xmath111 for potential @xmath70 .",
    "+ if we use a simple case from a acceptable range of @xmath112 and @xmath113 for analytical solution of scalar field equation ( 38 ) , we obtain analytical solution for dynamic of scalar filed equation as follows @xmath114    @xmath115",
    "@xmath116 @xmath117\\big[\\left(6{{h_0}}^{2}{{m_3 } } ^{2}-\\lambda'\\right ) ^{3/2}\\big]^{-1}\\ ] ] where we take @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 is an integration constant .",
    "+ in the following we consider equation of state ( 36 ) with using equation ( 39 ) for exact dynamic of equation of state , then study crossing phantom divided line and other options in our model .",
    "the result of our numerical calculation has been shown in figures 2 - 5 and 6 - 9 .",
    "the summarize of results given in table 1 . according figures 2 - 5 and table 1",
    ", our model can explain crossing phantom divided , that is relevant to observational data .",
    "in other hand , one has been discussed in [ 29 - 36 ] about what conditions lead to a rip singularity solutions , now we consider , can this model predict a rip singularity in context .",
    "we note that just two cases of singularity means big and little singularity study in following . therefore ,",
    "as shown in figures 6 - 9 , we provide suitable conditions for appear rip singularity(this situation occur in @xmath121 branch ) . as see in a numerical solution ,",
    "this situations appear in the phantom barrier , in this case the equation of state increase rapidly in finite or infinite time .",
    "hence we can consider the solution in two major cases as known little and big singularities .",
    "in fact we can take a dynamical explication to a case of solutions that leading to the requirement of big rip or little rip singularity .",
    "instead , from this case of solutions we should choose those requirement which the constraint by observational data .",
    "in other view point , some other types of singularity maybe appears in our work .",
    "one can easily check other type singularity with suitable conditions in this model .",
    "+    .considering crossing phantom divided line and rip singularity in equation of state in equation ( 36 ) on all branch for @xmath122 ( middle ) and @xmath121 ( right ) in equation ( 21 ) for potential of the form @xmath70 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now we should describe what case of equation of state is studied for determine the character of mixed fluids . typically in this model",
    ", we use three energy - momentum contents , 1 : the ordinary matter 2 : dark energy describe by the scalar field 3 : energy - momentum content which determine by a lorentz violation vector field . here",
    "we consider that ordinary matter has partial part of entire energy - momentum content .",
    "but for other contents , in our model it is possible to take the `` trigger mechanism '' to describe dynamical equation of state .",
    "i.e. we suppose that scalar- vector - tensor theory with liv acts similar a hybrid inflation models . in this",
    "regard , scaler and vector field have the roles of inflaton and the `` waterfall '' field .",
    "hence , we can fine - tuning parameters of model for best fit with observational data [ 10,25 ] .",
    "it is acceptable to expect that one of them suddenly dominate and we have a cosmological stage , for example , inflation phase or acceleration phase and etc .",
    "note that an important result in this context is crossing of phantom divide barrier pdl that determine with a single minimal coupling scalar field and by a lorentz violating vector field , if considering suitable fine tuning of model parameters .",
    "we have consider a possible violation of lorentz invariance in a dgp brane cosmology .",
    "also we have shown that by a suitable choice of parameter space , it is possible to have crossing phantom divided barrier ( pdl ) and it can predicts rip singularity in liv context .",
    "we used an interactive picture , a minimally coupled scalar field and a lorentz violating vector field can lead to the phantom phase .",
    "the comparison of our results with cosmology of 4d non - minimal vector theories show same aspects but with non minimal coupling in vector term , for example , explain the late time acceleration of the universe[26,27,28 ] . instead",
    ", those models have been shown that a non minimally vector field can be a candidate for dark energy[28 ] just like our model .",
    "in other view point , in this framework , there is the possibility of a rip singularity by suitable tuning in the parameters . as shown in figs .",
    "6 - 9 , we have studied some type of solutions called little or big rip , that maybe occur in structures of the universe , according to the increasing of the dark energy density .",
    "however , in correct choice of parameters maybe other types of singularity appear in this model .",
    "finally we emphasize that we have used a model of a scalar field with lorentz violation to describe some cosmological aspects .",
    "we believe this model can perform some fascinating predictions for observations .",
