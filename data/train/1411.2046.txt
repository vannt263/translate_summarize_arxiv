    "the dense nuclear matter under magnetic fields has been intensively studied ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , particularly in relation to astrophysical issues .",
    "investigations of the neutron star structure  @xcite as well as the cooling of magnetized stars  @xcite need the equation of state for magnetized matter as an important input . the presence of very intense magnetic fields in compact stellar objects has been proposed , based on the observational evidence of periodic or irregular radiation from localized sources . according to the energy released and",
    "the periodicity of the episodes , these objects have been classified as pulsars , soft gamma ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars .",
    "they have been associated with different stages of the evolution of neutron stars . on the star surface",
    "the magnetic field could reach values @xmath0 g , as in the case of magnetars and it is expected a growth of several orders of magnitude in its dense interior .    recent investigations @xcite have pointed out that matter created in heavy ion collisions could be subject to very strong magnetic fields . as a consequence the particle production would exhibit a distinguishable anisotropy .",
    "a preferential emission of charged particles along the direction of the magnetic field is predicted in  @xcite for noncentral heavy ion collisions , due to magnetic intensities @xmath1 mev .",
    "improved calculations taking care of the mass distribution of the colliding ions @xcite , does not modify essentially the magnitude of the produced fields .",
    "furthermore , the numerical simulations performed by @xcite predict larger values @xmath2 mev@xmath3 .",
    "the effects of magnetic fields on a dense nuclear environment have been described using different models @xcite .",
    "for instance , covariant field theoretical models have been used to study the role of the magnetic field on hyperonic matter @xcite , instabilities at subsaturation densities @xcite , magnetization of stellar matter @xcite , saturation properties of symmetric matter @xcite and the symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "non - relativistic models have also been used , in the effective interactions of @xcite or the microscopic models used in the variational calculations of @xcite .",
    "a comparison of neutron matter results , using different models was presented in @xcite .",
    "it is a well known fact that the nuclear environment experiences thermodynamical instabilities at subnuclear densities and low temperatures .",
    "evidence of this phenomenon can be found in the isospin distillation effect for heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "these instabilities give rise to a coexistence of phases if the surface tension is low enough .",
    "a more complex scenario is obtained when an external magnetic field is added , since there is a competition among two opposite trends .",
    "on one hand the magnetic force induces a globally ordered state with aligned spins . on the other hand",
    "the nuclear interaction favors the coexistence of phases where two states of different densities and spin polarizations are combined in order to lower the free energy .    in the present work",
    "we explore the possibility of a coexistence of phases for nuclear matter under strong magnetic fields , taking as variables the nuclear density , the isospin composition of matter , and the temperature @xmath4 mev .",
    "the possible fields of applications , such as those mentioned before , show a complex scenario where the detailed physical mechanisms are not easy to understand because there is a superposition of effects which can combine to give very different manifestations .",
    "therefore , we aim to present here some of the variables appearing in realistic situations , emphasizing the role of each of these factors , and to understand how they interact in a specific environment .",
    "special attention is paid to the relevant quantities associated with them , as the spin polarization , the isothermal compressibility and the magnetic susceptibility . with this purpose in mind",
    "we have analyzed a wide range of isospin composition and we have also reached the extreme value @xmath5 g for the external magnetic field .",
    "this selection emphasizes the effects of these variables , which under certain conditions can appear weakened , or hidden by another factors .",

    "we are particularly interested in the contributions coming from terms containing time reversal - odd densities and currents , since they are active when spin states are not symmetrically occupied .",
    "a derivation of these terms can be found in @xcite .",
    "we assume the magnetic field has not dynamics , that is , it behaves as an external field .",
    "there is a direct coupling between nucleons and the magnetic field , due to their intrinsic magnetic moments .",
    "this implies an additional term @xmath13 to the single particle spectra of the standard skyrme model , where @xmath14 is the bohr magneton and the lande factors @xmath15 take account of the anomalous magnetic moments .",
    "they take the values @xmath16 and @xmath17 for protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "+ furthermore , the magnetic field induce a quantization of the energy spectra of charged particles @xcite . in the case of a uniform field ,",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation exhibits quantized eigenvalues , associated with the motion in directions orthogonal to the applied field .",
    "they are oscillator - like levels , depending on a discrete quantum number in the form @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the cyclotron frequency of the particle .",

    "finally , the standard relations are used for the isothermal compressibility @xmath63 and magnetic susceptibility @xmath64 , @xmath65 note that in our scheme we were able to develop analytical expressions for the isothermal compressibility and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this gives us some confidence in the evaluation of these magnitudes , as for instance , the susceptibility for low temperatures has fast variations with the density .    in our approach both proton and neutron numbers",
    "are conserved separately , therefore the states of polarization of each component are also independent .",
    "the global polarization is determined by the condition of minimum free energy @xmath66 .",
    "this criterium differs from that in @xcite , where the legendre transformed potential @xmath67 was used .",
    "the equilibrium state has a variable spin configuration , depending on @xmath68 and @xmath21 .",
    "as will be shown , in the low temperature and low density domain the coexistence of phases imposes a state with a lower degree of polarization than the case which does not consider the phase transition .",
    "the nuclear interaction gives rise to instabilities in a dense infinite medium at low temperatures .",
    "if the coulomb interaction is taken into account and its fluctuations are included , a nucleation process can be found .",
    "+ under the hypothesis assumed in the present work , the system evolves through a succession of equilibrium states , where it decomposes spontaneously into two phases of different density and isospin composition .",
    "this phenomenon has been classified as a non  congruent phase transition @xcite since there are two conserved charges , i.e. proton and neutron numbers .",
    "its importance in the study of the in ",

    "these two coexisting phases , distinguished in the following by superindices @xmath43 and @xmath69 , have different numbers of proton and neutrons . however they are subject to the thermodynamical equilibrium conditions , @xmath70 furthermore , each phase contributes to every intensive additive physical quantity , such as the densities of energy , entropy , etc .",
    "thus , the free energy per unit volume and the density number of nucleons for the whole system can be written as @xmath71 where the coefficient @xmath72 can be interpreted as the fraction of the partial volume occupied by the state @xmath69 , hence it is bounded by @xmath73 .    in fig .",

    "the partial contributions to the magnetization @xmath77 , the susceptibility @xmath78 and the compressibility @xmath79 are evaluated in the same way as for a pure single phase .",
    "for the skyrme model the sly4 parametrization is used , for which @xmath80 mev @xmath81 , @xmath82 mev @xmath83 , @xmath84 mev @xmath83 , @xmath85 mev @xmath86 , @xmath87",
    "@xcite . the saturation density ,",
    "binding energy , incompressibility and symmetry energy are @xmath88 @xmath89 , @xmath90 mev , @xmath91 mev and @xmath92 mev , respectively .",
    "another significative quantity is the in - medium nucleon mass at the saturation density , for which @xmath93 is obtained .    in first place",
    "we discuss the effects of the gibbs construction on the pressure and the spin asymmetry coefficient @xmath94 .",
    "these results are shown in fig .  1 , for @xmath95  g and @xmath96  mev , which is representative for most of the cases studied in this work .",
    "the gibbs construction is shown in dashed lines and replaces , within the coexistence region ( cr ) , the plain results of the model described in section [ secii ] . in panel ( a ) it is shown that the cr includes the instability region where the pressure decreases with density . the gibbs construction instead , produces a rather linear increasing pressure .",
    "the density domain of the cr is reduced and eventually vanishes , by increasing the isospin asymmetry @xmath97 , as well as the temperature ( not shown in this figure ) . for certain values of temperature and magnetic intensity , as for example @xmath95 g , @xmath98 mev , the cr disappears for asymmetries above a typical value @xmath99 . in these cases and for @xmath100 ,",
    "a retrograde phase transition takes place .",
    "this means that the transition starts and ends at states of similar density and isospin composition , but in between an admixture with states of very different conditions is developed .",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon by including afterwards the case @xmath95 g , @xmath98 mev , @xmath101 .    in the panel ( b ) of the same figure , we show the spin asymmetry .",
    "it can be seen that protons and neutrons are highly polarized at very low densities and they depolarize progressively as the density grows .",
    "the coexistence of phases induces an equilibrium state with a significantly reduced degree of polarization , due to the admixture with a higher density and weaker polarization state . for higher magnetic intensities , such as @xmath5 g",
    ", the same mechanism causes the frustration of the total neutron magnetization , but it is not able to destroy the magnetic saturation of the proton , as will be discussed subsequently .    the behavior of the pressure as a function of the density for several temperatures and isospin asymmetries is shown in fig . 2 for @xmath95 g and fig . 3 for @xmath5 g. the points where a sudden change of slope occurs ,",
    "correspond to an endpoint of the cr .",
    "they do not appear for some particular cases at @xmath98 mev , because the coexistence does not exist for @xmath5 g and @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "3b ) , whereas a retrograde transition goes on for @xmath101 , @xmath95 g ( fig .",
    "2b ) , as explained above . for a given magnetic intensity ,",
    "thermal effects are more important for lower densities .",
    "furthermore , an increase of the magnetic intensity at constant temperature induces an evident increment of the pressure for @xmath102 , but the opposite trend is observed for @xmath103 .",
    "it must be pointed out that the gibbs construction eliminates all the instabilities for the range of densities and temperatures studied here .",
    "in particular there are no regions where the pressure decreases with the density .",
    "the density dependence of the spin asymmetry fraction is shown in fig . 4 for @xmath96 , several values of @xmath97 , @xmath95 g ( fig .",
    "4a ) and @xmath5 g ( fig .",
    "thermal variations are of no relevance for this quantity . for the lower field intensity , the proton relative polarization is enhanced as @xmath97 decreases , whereas for the neutrons there is only a weak dependence on the isospin composition . for @xmath5",
    "g , the proton component is completely polarized for all the range of @xmath10 and @xmath97 .",
    "the effect of the medium polarization is emphasized in this case , as can be seen in the dependence on @xmath97 of the neutron spin asymmetry for @xmath104 . for a fixed total density @xmath10 ,",
    "the neutron component is completely polarized for @xmath105 and is progressively depolarized as @xmath97 increases .",
    "this is a consequence of the dynamical coupling of protons and neutrons ( see eqs .",
    "( [ protsp])-([skmpotential ] ) ) .",
    "it must be pointed out that both components , but specially protons in a high @xmath97 sample , tend to recover a high degree of polarization at densities @xmath106 .",
    "this feature can be a manifestation of the abnormal spontaneous magnetization described by the skyrme model at extreme densities .",
    "results for the free energy per volume @xmath107 as a function of the density , are shown in fig .",
    "5 ( @xmath95 g ) and fig .  6 ( @xmath5 g ) . at relatively low densities",
    "the kinetic energy and the repulsion between nucleons are small , while the effect of the magnetic field becomes the dominant one .",
    "for medium and high densities the repulsive character of the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the kinetic energy dominate over the magnetic field and the system increases its energy .",
    "this is clearly depicted in fig .  5 , whereas for @xmath5  g in fig .  6",
    ", only the @xmath101 case fits this description .",
    "for other values of @xmath97 one should go to higher densities to verify this behavior . from both figures",
    "we can see that the addition of protons makes the system to be more bound and so does the increase of the magnetic field .",
    "thermal effects are weak , as opposite contributions tend to cancel each other : the kinetic term increases with @xmath42 , while the entropy contribution does the opposite .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility characterizes the response of the system to the external field and gives a measure of the energy required to produce a net spin alignment in the direction of the field .",
    "we have found that this quantity at moderate field intensities , is sensitive to thermal variations , hence we devote figs .",
    "7 - 9 to give a more detailed description of the density dependence of @xmath64 .",
    "for all the cases shown , there is a low density regime where the system has an almost saturated magnetization ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , therefore the magnetic response is nearly zero .",
    "as it was previously discussed , in most cases the coexistence of phases frustrates the total magnetization and consequently enhances the magnetic response within the cr .",
    "this fact can be distinguished by an approximately linear increase , with a small slope , of the susceptibility as a function of the total density .",
    "+ the magnetic susceptibility shows a complex dependence on the population of the landau levels .",
    "therefore , in order to clarify the discussion afterwards , it is worth to make some general considerations about this relationship . in first place",
    "it must be pointed out that the population of the landau levels decreases with both @xmath21 and @xmath97 , but it increases with both @xmath10 and @xmath42 .",
    "however , the distribution function becomes smoother as the temperature grows , erasing eventually effects due to the progressive occupation of different landau levels . in second place ,",
    "when very high levels are occupied , further changes in the quantum number @xmath108 has only imperceptible consequences on the susceptibility .",
    "finally , the proton component generally shows a diamagnetic behavior , but it turns to be paramagnetic when the statistical occupation is peaked at the lowest landau level @xmath109 .",
    "+ now we focus on the susceptibility for protons in the lower panel of fig . 7 , where the case of @xmath95 g and @xmath110  mev , is illustrated . for increasing densities",
    ", the susceptibility changes from a linear response to an oscillatory behavior .",
    "the linear response turns out from the gibbs construction , while the oscillatory behavior is a consequence of the population of the landau levels .",
    "note that in the evaluation of the partial contributions @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ crsusp ] ) , the landau levels also play a role .",
    "however , the narrow range of variation of the densities @xmath111 and @xmath112 allows the linear behavior for the susceptibility . for @xmath105 and @xmath113",
    "the system is diamagnetic , while for @xmath101 it is mainly paramagnetic due to the fact that only the lowest landau levels are accessible . in the upper panel of the same figure ,",
    "the neutron susceptibility is depicted . an important change in the scale is observed .",
    "the neutron susceptibility is always paramagnetic and also has a linear behavior for low densities which changes to oscillatory as the density grows . even though neutrons do not have discrete levels , they are influenced by the dynamical coupling among protons and neutrons ( see eqs .",
    "( [ protsp]) ( [ effmass ] ) ) . for the case",
    "@xmath101 a sudden decrease at @xmath114 , is observed due to a change in the spin configuration of the system .",
    "a small increase of the temperature , keeping fixed the magnetic intensity , destroys the oscillations at high densities .",
    "see fig . 8 for @xmath95 g , @xmath96 mev .",
    "the magnetic response of protons becomes almost linear for the full range of densities .",
    "two ingredients contribute to these results : the distribution function becomes smoother as the temperature grows and the statistical occupation of the landau levels increase , being this last effect the dominant one .",
    "for the two figures just described , there is a noticeable difference of magnitude between the susceptibility of protons and neutrons .",
    "the proton component is significantly more reactive to changes of the magnetic intensity .",
    "the effects of changing the magnetic intensity by keeping fixed the temperature are exposed in fig .",
    "9 , where we present the results for @xmath5 g , @xmath96 mev .",
    "a dramatic change of scale is apparent for both components , but specially for protons .",
    "this fact is coherent with the saturation of proton spin alignment ( see fig .",
    "4b ) , as a consequence the proton component experiences a change of regime from diamagnetic to paramagnetic .",
    "in contrast , neutrons which only have a paramagnetic channel , are completely blocked when the saturation of spin alignment is reached .",
    "hence we have @xmath115 , as for @xmath105 .",
    "note that for @xmath5  g , the statistical occupation of the landau level is strongly dominated by @xmath109 , which explains the paramagnetic behavior of the proton susceptibility .    in figs .",
    "10 and 11 , the isothermal compressibility is presented as a function of the density for @xmath95 g and @xmath5 g , respectively . in both figures",
    "we show results for @xmath110 , 5 and 10 mev and isospin asymmetries @xmath105 , 0.4 and 0.8 . for all the cases shown ,",
    "there is a clear difference between the cr and the domain of higher densities . in the last case",
    ", we found the typical behavior of an almost incompressible fluid with a slightly decreasing compressibility . here",
    "the variation of temperature and isospin composition have weak effects , but they become appreciable for @xmath5 g. an exceptional behavior is found for @xmath5 , @xmath105 , @xmath110  mev , where a local maximum can be seen around @xmath116 .",
    "it seems to be a feature of the model used and deserves a further investigation .",
    "+ within the cr , the compressibility decreases strongly for very low densities and becomes increasing for moderately higher values . as a consequence a local maximum of @xmath63 arises at the extreme point of the cr .",
    "this description applies strictly to the lowest temperature shown here , @xmath110 mev .",
    "as @xmath42 is increased , the effect becomes less pronounced , but is still perceptible for @xmath5 g , whereas it is completely missed for @xmath95 g.    as the last matter of analysis we present in fig .",
    "12 the phase diagram for a fixed value @xmath5 g. here the closed curves correspond to the isothermal contour of the cr , for both the @xmath117 ( fig .",
    "12a ) and @xmath118 ( fig .",
    "12b ) planes .",
    "the cr for a given temperature is enclosed by the corresponding curve . in the upper panel for each curve",
    "there is a maximum value for the pressure , at the left and below that pressure lies the lower density gaseous phase and , at the right the higher density liquid phase . above that pressure",
    "a continuous passage from one phase to another occurs . as the temperature grows the area within the contour",
    "is reduced and eventually collapse to the critical point . note that at very low pressures it is necessary to include states with a small proton excess in order to complete the phase diagram",
    "in this work we have addressed the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter under the action of very strong magnetic fields , temperatures below @xmath119  mev and densities up to twice the saturation density .",
    "for the nuclear interaction we have used the non  relativistic skyrme potential model ( sly4 parametrization ) within a hartree  fock approximation .",
    "we have paid special attention to the low  density and low  temperature domain , where the nuclear interaction gives rise to instabilities , commonly associated with a liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "if the coulomb force is not included , the equilibrium state of the system separates spontaneously into coexisting phases .",
    "this phase transition was studied in detail in the past  @xcite and it has received renewed attention recently in connection with astrophysical investigations  @xcite and also in heavy  ion collisions , where the liquid ",
    "gas instabilities are related to the formation of fragments occurring in finite nuclear systems  @xcite .    here",
    "we introduce an external magnetic field as a new parameter which modifies the properties of the coexisting phases .",
    "we propose and analyze the spin polarization , the magnetic susceptibility and the isothermal compressibility as physical quantities that reveal the changes in the global configuration as well as in the internal composition of the equilibrium state .",
    "a related investigation , but restricted to neutron matter , has been presented recently in @xcite . there , a comparison of the predictions of very different models was made , which give us some confidence about the common features and warn us about possible singularities of the model chosen .    to obtain the physical equation of state , we have implemented the so called gibbs construction , which is the appropriate procedure when there are multiple conserved charges .    referring to the spin polarization , it is higher for very low densities .",
    "neutrons are in general less polarized than protons . at extreme intensities ( @xmath5 g ) the effect of the medium polarization is emphasized , due to the dynamical coupling of protons and neutrons ( see eqs .",
    "( [ protsp])-([skmpotential ] ) ) the relative magnetization of the neutrons is enhanced by increasing the proton fraction .",
    "the spin asymmetry depends weakly on the temperature , while it is strongly affected by the magnetic field .",
    "the spontaneous separation into independent phases reduces the degree of polarization for both protons and neutrons .",
    "this can be understood because for a given total density within the cr , one of such phases has a greater partial density and a lower polarization .",
    "this is the reason why neutrons do not reach the magnetic saturation at medium densities under the strongest intensity considered here .",
    "the energy per volume shows that the addition of protons makes the system more bound . and",
    "so happens for increasing the magnetic field . at variance",
    ", the dependence with temperature is rather small .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is the most sensitive quantity , as it shows a strong dependence on the isospin asymmetry , the temperature and the magnetic intensity . for protons",
    "these dependencies manifest through the population of the landau levels , which also reflects in the neutron susceptibility due to the dynamical coupling generated by the skyrme model .",
    "the susceptibility in the cr is almost linear .",
    "the isothermal compressibility at very low temperature offers a clear manifestation of the changes in the phase diagram . out",
    "the cr the results corresponds to an almost incompressible fluid , decreasing slowly with density and showing a small dependence on @xmath120 and @xmath21 . within the cr , the compressibility changes from steeply decreasing at very low densities , to moderately increasing . in such a way a local",
