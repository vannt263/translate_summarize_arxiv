    "the astrophysical site of the @xmath0-process , the rapid neutron - capture process that makes half the elements heavier than iron , remains a long - standing mystery of nucleosynthesis .",
    "recently , compact binary mergers ( cbms ) of double neutron star ( ns - ns ) and black hole  neutron star ( bh - ns ) systems have received considerable attention as possible sources of the @xmath0-process nuclei @xcite according to the following reasons .",
    "first , radioactively powered `` kilonova '' emission from the @xmath0-processed ejecta can be a promising electro - magnetic counterpart to the gravitational - wave signal from a cbm event @xcite .",
    "the possible identification of a kilonova associated with the _ swift _ grb  130603b @xcite also indicates that cbms are the progenitors of short - duration gamma - ray bursts and the sources of @xmath0-process elements @xcite .",
    "another reason is that core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ; in particular proto - ns wind ) , the site that has been believed to be the promising sources of the @xmath0-process nuclei , are found to provide only marginal conditions for making the elements beyond iron @xcite .",
    "nucleosynthesis studies with such physical environments confirm that ccsne produce the elements only up to the atomic mass number @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "one possible exception could be the scenario of ( still hypothetical ) rapidly rotating , strongly magnetized ccsn cores @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have explored nucleosynthesis based on the approximate ( conformally flat spatial metric ) general - relativistic ( gr ) simulations of ns - ns mergers .",
    "they found that the ejecta had extremely low electron fractions ( @xmath2 ) , which led to fission recycling and thus robust production of only heavy @xmath0-process nuclei with @xmath9 .",
    "similar results were obtained from the newtonian simulations of ns - ns and bh - ns mergers by @xcite .",
    "little production of the lighter @xmath0-process nuclei ( @xmath10120 ) conflicts , however , with the recent spectroscopic results of galactic halo stars @xcite .",
    "that is , the so - called `` universality '' of the ( solar - like ) @xmath0-process pattern , first identified for @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , persists down to @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) within about a factor of two .",
    "there has been no sign of nucleosynthetic events making the nuclei exclusively with @xmath15 .",
    "contribution from , e.g. , the subsequent bh accretion - torus wind @xcite might cure this problem .",
    "in this letter , we report our first result of nucleosynthesis study based on the full - gr , approximate neutrino transport simulation of a ns - ns merger .",
    "the gr effects , being crucial for the dynamical evolutions of merger ejecta as pointed out by @xcite , were not fully taken into account in the previous studies . moreover , neutrino transport that can affect the ejecta @xmath4 is neglected in all previous studies ( except for the 2d newtonian simulation by * ? ? ? * without nucleosynthesis calculations ) .",
    "our ns - ns merger model is described in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the subsequent nucleosynthesis result is presented in section  [ sec : nucleosynthesis ] .",
    "the radioactive heating rates ( relevant for kilonova emission ) are also obtained from the nucleosynthesis calculations ( section  [ sec : heating ] ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical evolution of a ns - ns merger is followed with a recently - developed 3d full - gr code ( y. sekiguchi et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) , which is updated from the previous version @xcite .",
    "neutrino transport is taken into account based on the thorne s moment scheme @xcite with a closure relation .",
    "for neutrino heating , absorption on free nucleons is considered .",
    "the gravitational masses ( in isolation ) are taken to be @xmath16 for both nss .",
    "we adopt an equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter developed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sfho ) , which has the maximum ns mass sufficiently greater than the largest well - measured mass ( @xmath17 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this eos gives the radius @xmath18  km for a cold ns , being in the range constrained from nuclear experiments , nuclear theory , and astrophysical observations , 10.713.1  km for a @xmath19 ns @xcite .",
    "note that the eos of @xcite adopted in many previous simulations gives @xmath20  km for a @xmath19 ns , being substantially greater than the upper bound of this constraint .    at the beginning of simulation ( @xmath21 ) , each ns consists of matter with @xmath22 in the ( neutrino - less ) @xmath7-equilibrium with the constant temperature 0.1  mev .",
    "the background medium is placed with the same temperature , density decreasing from @xmath23  g  @xmath24 ( in the central region ) to @xmath25  g  @xmath24 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the merging of nss starts at @xmath27  ms with increasing density at the origin of the coordinate axis , @xmath28 ( figure  [ fig : evolution ] ) .",
    "this leads to the steep rises of masses ( @xmath29  ms ) outside 150  km ( from the center ) coming from the contact interface region .",
    "a hypermassive ns ( hmns ) forms at @xmath30  ms .",
    "the second phase of mass ejection follows in response to the interaction between the inner atmospheric material ( originating from the shear interface ) and the rapidly rotating , quasi - radially oscillating hmns ( from @xmath31  ms ) .",
    "we find that the total ejecta mass is dominated ( @xmath32 ) by this second phase .",
    "the simulation ends at @xmath33  ms with the distributions of density , temperature , @xmath4 , and entropy ( per nucleon ; @xmath34 , @xmath35 is boltzmann s constant ) shown in figure  [ fig : image ] . at this time , the bulk of ejecta ( total mass of @xmath36 ) are freely expanding with the velocities @xmath37@xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the speed of light ) .",
    "the behavior of mass ejection described here is in qualitative agreement with the previous full - gr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for soft eoss ) and approximate gr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for the same sfho eos ) works .",
    "as pointed out in these studies , the mass ejection is due to shock - heating and tidal torque ; neutrino - heating plays a subdominant role .    as the hmns forms , temperature near its surface gets as high as @xmath40  mev ( @xmath41  gk ) , giving rise to copious @xmath42 pairs that activate the weak interactions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and their inverses .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 captures convert some part of neutrons to protons ; the ejecta @xmath4 s increase from the initial low values .. however , the mass suffering from these artifacts is negligibly small compared to the total ejecta mass ( figure  [ fig : evolution ] ) . ]",
    "the first outgoing ejecta from the contact interface region are away from the hmns when it forms and thus neutrino capture is subdominant . as a result , the @xmath4 s are relatively low ( @xmath470.2 ; blue - cyan spiral arms in figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "the outer ejecta with higher @xmath4 ( @xmath480.3 ) are unimportant in the total ejecta mass because of their low densities .    in the second phase of mass ejection",
    ", neutrinos coming from the hmns surface play a crucial role .",
    "the luminosities and mean energies are only slightly greater for @xmath49 than those for @xmath46 ( figure  [ fig : evolution ] ) . the asymptotic @xmath4 ( after sufficient time ) with these values is expected to be @xmath50 ( e.g. , eq .  ( 77 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , neutrino absorption in the fast outgoing ejecta freezes before @xmath4 reaches @xmath51 , resulting in @xmath520.4 ( yellow - orange spiral arms in figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "the ejecta mass distributions in @xmath4 and @xmath34 at the end of simulation are displayed in figure  [ fig : histogram ] for the @xmath53-@xmath54 , @xmath53-@xmath55 , and @xmath54-@xmath55 planes .",
    "we find that the @xmath4 s widely distribute between 0.09 and 0.45 with greater amounts for higher @xmath4 , in which the initial @xmath7-equilibrium values ( @xmath56 ) have gone .",
    "non - orbital ejecta have higher @xmath4 s because of the shock - heated matter escaping to the low - density polar regions @xcite .",
    "the shock heating results in @xmath34 up to @xmath57 and 50 for the orbital and non - orbital planes , respectively ( with higher values for higher @xmath4 ) , which are sizably greater than those in ( * ? ? ? * @xmath583 ) with the shen s eos .",
    "the nucleosynthesis analysis makes use of the thermodynamic trajectories of the ejecta particles traced on the orbital plane .",
    "a representative particle is chosen from each @xmath4-bin ( from @xmath59 to 0.44 with the interval of @xmath60 ( figure  [ fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "for simplicity , we analyze only the @xmath53-@xmath54 components because of the dominance of the ejecta masses close to the orbital plane .",
    "each nucleosynthesis calculation is initiated when the temperature decreases to 10  gk , where the initial composition is given by @xmath4 and @xmath61 for the mass fractions of free protons and neutrons .",
    "the reaction network consists of 6300 species from single neutrons and protons to the @xmath62 isotopes .",
    "experimental rates , when available , are taken from the latest versions of reaclib @xcite and nuclear wallet cards .",
    "otherwise , the theoretical estimates of fusion rates ( talys , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath7-decay half - lives ( gt2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are adopted , where both are based on the same nuclear masses ( hfb-21 , * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical fission properties adopted are those estimated on the basis of the hfb-14 mass model . for fission fragments ,",
    "a gaussian - type distribution is assumed with emission of four prompt neutrons per event .",
    "neutrino captures are not included , which make only slight shifts of @xmath4 ( typically an increase of @xmath63 from 10  gk to 5  gk ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical trajectories end with temperatures @xmath64  gk .",
    "further temporal evolutions are followed by the density drop like @xmath65 and with the temperatures computed with the eos of @xcite by adding the entropies generated by @xmath7-decay , fission , and @xmath66-decay .",
    "this entropy generation slows the temperature drop around 1  gk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the effect is , however , less dramatic than those found in previous works because of the higher ejecta entropies in our result .",
    "figure  [ fig : ymav ] ( top ) displays the final nuclear abundances for selected trajectories .",
    "we find a variety of nucleosynthetic outcomes : iron - peak and @xmath14 abundances made in nuclear quasi - equilibrium for @xmath67 , light @xmath0-process abundances for @xmath680.4 , and heavy @xmath0-process abundances for @xmath69 .",
    "different from the previous works , we find no fission recycling ; the nuclear flow for the lowest @xmath4 ( @xmath70 ) trajectory reaches @xmath71 , the fissile point by neutron - induced fission , only at the freezeout of @xmath0-processing .",
    "spontaneous fission plays a role for forming the @xmath72 abundance peak , but only for @xmath73 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ymav ] ( bottom ) shows the mass - averaged nuclear abundances by weighting the final yields for the representative trajectories with their @xmath4 mass fractions on the orbital plane ( figure  [ fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "we find a good agreement of our result with the solar @xmath0-process abundance distribution over the full-@xmath74 range of @xmath75240 ( although the pattern would be somewhat modified by adding non - orbital components ) .",
    "this result , differing from the previous works exhibiting production of @xmath9 nuclei only , is a consequence of the wide @xmath4 distribution predicted from our full - gr , neutrino transport simulation .",
    "note also that fission plays a subdominant role for the final nucleosynthetic abundances . the second ( @xmath76 ) and rare - earth - element ( @xmath77 ) peak abundances",
    "are dominated by direct production from the trajectories of @xmath78 .",
    "our result reasonably reproduces the solar - like abundance ratio between the second ( @xmath79 ) and third ( @xmath80 ) peaks as well , which is difficult to explain by fission recycling .",
    "given that the model is representative of ns - ns mergers , our result gives an important implication ; the dynamical ejecta of ns - ns mergers can be the dominant origin of all the galactic @xmath0-process nuclei .",
    "other contributions from , e.g. , the bh - torus wind after collapse of hmnss , as invoked in the previous studies to account for the ( solar - like ) @xmath0-process universality , may not be needed .",
    "the amount of entirely @xmath0-processed ejecta @xmath36 with present estimates of the galactic event rate ( a few @xmath81  yr@xmath82 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also compatible with the mass of the galactic @xmath0-process abundances as also discussed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-processing ends a few 100  ms after the merging .",
    "the subsequent abundance changes by @xmath7-decay , fission , and @xmath66-decay are followed up to @xmath83  days ; the resulting radioactive heating is relevant for kilonova emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : qdot ] displays the temporal evolutions of the heating rates for selected trajectories ( top - left ) and those mass - averaged ( top - right ) . for comparison purposes , the heating rate for the nuclear abundances with the solar @xmath0-process pattern ( for @xmath84 , @xmath85 ; same as that used in * ? ? ?",

    "lower panels show the heating rates relative to @xmath88 .",
    "overall , each curve reasonably follows @xmath88 by @xmath6  day . after this time",
    ", the heating is dominated by a few radioactivities and becomes highly dependent on @xmath4 .",
    "contributions from the ejecta of @xmath89 are generally unimportant after @xmath6  day . we find that the heating for @xmath90 turns to be significant after a few 10 days because of the @xmath7-decays from @xmath91kr ( half - life of @xmath92  yr ; see figure  [ fig : ymav ] for its large abundance ) , @xmath93sr ( @xmath94  d ) , and @xmath95ru ( @xmath96  d ) . heating rates for @xmath97 and 0.24 ,",
    "whose abundances are dominated by the second peak nuclei , are found to be in good agreement with @xmath85 .",
    "this is due to a predominance of @xmath7-decay heating from the second peak abundances , e.g. , @xmath98sn ( @xmath99",
    "d ) and @xmath100sn ( @xmath101  d ) around a few 10  days .",
    "our result shows that the heating rate for the lowest @xmath4 ( @xmath102 ) is the greatest after 1  day with a few times larger values than those in previous works ( with @xmath1030.04 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our case ,",
    "the radioactive heating is dominated by the spontaneous fissions of @xmath104cf and @xmath105fm .",
    "it should be noted that the heating from spontaneous fission is highly uncertain because of the many unknown half - lives and decay modes of nuclides reaching to this quasi - stable region ( @xmath106260 with @xmath107 of days to years ) .",
    "in fact , tests with another set of theoretical estimates show a few times smaller rates after @xmath6  day ( because of diminishing contributions from @xmath108fm ) , being similar to the previous works .",
    "it appears difficult to obtain reliable heating rates with currently available nuclear data when fission plays a dominant role .    in our result",
    "the total heating rate is dominated by @xmath7-decays all the times because of the small ejecta amount of @xmath109 . the radioactive heating after @xmath6  day is mostly due to the @xmath7-decays from a small number of species with precisely measured half - lives .",
    "uncertainties in nuclear data are thus irrelevant .",
    "the mass - averaged heating rate for @xmath11010  days is smaller than @xmath88 and @xmath85 because of the overabundances near @xmath111 ( figure  [ fig : ymav ] , bottom ) that do not significantly contribute to heating .",
    "the differences are , however , well within about a factor of two . in conclusion , if merger ejecta have a solar @xmath0-process - like abundance pattern , @xmath85 ( and @xmath88 ) serves as a good approximation for kilonova emission ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the total heating rate and peak time of a kilonova transient , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , of @xmath114 and 0.5 for @xmath115 and 10  days , respectively , with the thermalization factor of 0.5 @xcite . ] .",
    "it is important to note that our merger simulation exhibits different @xmath4 distributions between the orbital and polar directions ( figure  [ fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "multi - dimensional information of nucleosynthetic abundances will be needed when we discuss the angler dependences of kilonova emission @xcite .",
    "we examined @xmath0-process calculations based on the full - gr , approximate neutrino transport simulation of the ns - ns merger with the equal masses ( @xmath116 ) of nss . different from previous studies , the merger ejecta exhibited a wide range of @xmath1170.45 that led to the nucleosynthetic abundance distribution being in good agreement with the solar @xmath0-process pattern .",
    "given that the model is representative , our result ( with the present estimate of the galactic event rate ) implies that ns - ns mergers can be the major origin of all the @xmath0-process elements in the galaxy .",
    "our result also indicates that the radioactive heating ( that powers a kilonova transient ) after @xmath6  day from the merging is dominated by the @xmath7-decays of a small number of species with measured half - lives .",
    "the total heating rates are thus well approximated by the @xmath7-decays of the solar @xmath0-process - like abundances as well as by the approximation of @xmath118 .",
    "detailed multi - dimensional information of nucleosynthesis abundances should be , however , taken into account when we consider the spatial dependences of kilonova emission .",
    "our result implies that the previous thought of ns - ns merger events , dynamically ejecting almost pure ns matter , should be reconsidered .",
    "the shock - heated and neutrino - processed ejecta from a hmns are in fact modestly neutron - rich : the phenomenon similar to the early stage of a ccsn ( a proto - ns instead of a hmns ) .",
    "much more works will be needed to test if similar results are obtained with full-3d nucleosynthetic analyses , with different ns masses and their ratios , with other ( reasonable ) eoss , with higher spatial resolution , etc .",
    "nucleosynthetic contributions from bh - ns mergers , as well as from the bh - accretion tori subsequent to ns - ns / bh - ns mergers , should be also explored to draw conclusions on the role of cbms to the galactic chemical evolution of the @xmath0-process nuclei .",

    "<S> our result also shows that the radioactive heating after @xmath6  day from the merging , giving rise to @xmath0-process - powered transient emission , is dominated by the @xmath7-decays of several species close to stability with precisely measured half - lives . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the total radioactive heating rate for such an event can be well constrained within about a factor of two if the ejected material has a solar - like @xmath0-process pattern . </S>"
