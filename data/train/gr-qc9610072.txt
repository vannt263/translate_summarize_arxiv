    "in many astrophysical and cosmological problems , the matter - radiation content is modeled by a so - called radiative plasma , a two component fluid consisting of some material medium ( perfect fluid , relativistic gas , ionized hydrogen atoms , etc . ) plus radiat ion quanta ( photons , neutrinos , or gravitons ) . in the simplest situation ,",
    "the material medium is assumed to be locally in thermal equilibrium with itself ( very short mean free times and mean free paths ) , whereas the massless component has a finite mean free time @xmath6 .",
    "however , even in this case , an idealized perfect fluid description of this mixture is inappropriate , and a deeper insight is provided by a kinetic theory approach . in particular , since the radiation quanta are out of equilibrium with the material component , all transport properties of this system , to first order of approximation , depend exclusively on the mean free time of radiation .",
    "the first self - consistent application of the relativistic kinetic theory to this system is due to thomas@xcite , who computed the correct values of the heat and shear viscosity transport coefficients .",
    "later on , by considering the concept of local equilibrium temperature , weinberg@xcite obtained the bulk viscosity coefficient , thereby showing that such a mixture behaves like an imperfect relativistic simple fluid in the framework of the hydrodynamical formulation for dissipative processes developed by eckart@xcite .",
    "masaki@xcite , recovered the results of thomas using a modern relativistic approach ( manifestly covariant ) .",
    "this work was considerably simplified by straumann@xcite , who also shown that if the thomson scattering dominates , the bulk viscosity coefficient goes to zero .",
    "more recently , by considering the @xmath7-moment grad approximation method to solve the boltzman equation , schweizer@xcite calculated the transient transport coefficients appearing in the linear , causal , hydrodynamical formulation proposed by israel and stewart@xcite .",
    "the physical and operational meaning of local equilibrium temperature ( eckart s temperature ) has also been discussed by several authors@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "since multidimensional models are presently believed to be the natural framework to unify all fundamental interactions , it is very common nowadays to study all phenomena and the underlying physics in an arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "historically , arbitrary dimensionality ( including fractal dimension ) has been widely considered in the context of newtonian gravitational theory and general relativity , quantum field theory , cosmology , phase transitions , renormalization group , quantum mechanics , lattice models and random walks@xcite-@xcite . in domain of cosmology , for instance ,",
    "several compactification mechanisms for extra dimensions , presumably taking place in the very early universe , have been suggested to explain the now observed 4-dimensional structure of spacetime@xcite-@xcite .    given the lack of knowledge about the initial state of the universe , the simplest dynamic approach to dimensional reduction is to construct a multidimensional anisotropic cosmological model based on some fundamental theory ( superstrings , kaluza - klein or einstein s gravitational theory ) where the extra spatial dimensions are collapsing while the `` physical dimensions '' are expanding , and eventually , leading to the present day universe .",
    "isotropization and cosmological dimensional reduction has also been considered in the framework of nonequilibrium higher dimensional cosmologies .",
    "concrete models have been proposed in the case of bulk and shear viscosities leading to the conclusion that viscosity may work efficiently to reduce the number of spatial dimensions.@xcite-@xcite . as a matter of fact , this is a new version of the earlier program of chaotic cosmology , for which the ordinary dissipative processes ( viscosity , heat flow , ... etc . ) were believed to be the mechanisms damping out any anisotropy and inhomogeneity existing in the primeval plasma@xcite . however , even considering that the kinetic approach is more fundamental than its related thermodynamics , the analysis mentioned above are usually based only on macroscopic equations . in particular , to the best of our knowledge , the explicit form of the transport coefficients considered in such works have not been derived from kinetic theory in d spatial dimensions .",
    "this one of the main aims of this article .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the definition of a radiative plasma , in principle , is not restricted to the class of systems mentioned above . under certain conditions , more exotic system as , for instance",
    ", a mixture of massive and massless modes in superstrings models could , formally , be interpreted as a radiative plasma in d dimensions .",
    "the reason for this possibility may be easily understood . in the collisional limit",
    ", two different temperatures are naturally defined in an radiative plasma , namely : the matter temperature(@xmath8 ) and the effective radiation kinetic temperature(@xmath9 ) .",
    "however , to first order in the mean free time , the latter is different from the former only if the exp ansion rate is different from zero .",
    "the expansion works to continuously pulling radiation and matter out of thermal equilibrium , because the components have different cooling rates . basically , this is the mechanism accounting for the presence of the bulk viscosity in such a mixture as well as in a relativistic simple gas@xcite . on the other hand , even in a thermodynamic setting ,",
    "a gas of hot strings(superstrings , or hagedorn s fireballs ) may also be described as a two temperature system when we have a mixture of heavy strings with a gas of light strings(see , for instance , @xcite ) .    from the above considerations",
    ", it seems interesting to analyze the transport properties of a d - dimensional radiative plasma . in this work , by extending the covariant 4-dimensional kinetic approach developed by straumann@xcite , we compute the transport coefficients for such a system .",
    "hopefully , the expressions derived here may be useful to study the effects of dissipative processes in higher dimensional cosmologies as well as in modeling a mixture of massive and massless modes in the framework of superstring theory .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section , the energy - momentum tensor for a d - dimensional radiative plasma is computed exactly by solving the d - dimensional boltzmann transport equation to first order in the mean free time of the radiation quanta . in section 3",
    "we discuss the physical meaning of eckart s temperature and obtain the transport coefficients of heat conduction , bulk and shear viscosities , and in section 4 , the photon and total entropy production are discussed . in section 5 , a specific model , namely , thomson scattering ,",
    "is studied .",
    "we conclude , in section 6 , with a discussion of our main results for higher dimensional cosmology , and in the following two appendix we proof the basic mathematical properties used in the article . in our units",
    "the physical constants @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant and the d+1-dimensional signature of the spacetime metric is @xmath12 .",
    "the basic object for computing the energy - momentum tensor(emt ) and other macroscopic quantities describing a d - dimensional radiative plasma is the radiation distribution function @xmath13 . as usual , it is defined in such a way that @xmath14 gives the number of quanta in the d - dimensional volume element located at @xmath15 , and whose d - momentum * k * lie within @xmath16 .",
    "now , by assuming that the radiation quanta ( photons for the sake of simplicity@xcite ) are out but close to equilibrium , we may expand @xmath13 , to first order in mean free time , as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the equilibrium distribution in the @xmath19-dimensional space    @xmath20    and the interaction part @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 . in the above expressions",
    ", @xmath23 is the normalized four - velocity field ( @xmath24 ) of the material medium and @xmath25 its local temperature which , in equilibrium , coincides with the uniform temperature @xmath26 of the material medium .",
    "the distribution function satisfies the boltzmann transport equation which to first order may be written as    @xmath27 , \\ ] ]    where l is a linear operator which depends on the specific model ( interaction of radiation and material fluid ) .",
    "following strauman@xcite , the solution of the above equation will be discussed , as far as possible , in rather general terms .",
    "an application of these results for a specific model will be presented in section 5 .    as is widely known , the above eq.([eq:3 ] )",
    "can not , in general , be exactly solved so that some approximation scheme need to be implemented .",
    "one which is often considered is provided by the grad s relativistic 9-moments method applied in refs.@xcite to the 4-dimensional case . in the present d - dimensional framework it may be generalized as is explained below .",
    "let @xmath28 be the @xmath19-dimensional lorentz group of the minkowski - like space - time @xmath29 and @xmath30 the little group associated to a timelike vector @xmath31 .",
    "this subgroup of @xmath28 leaves @xmath31 invariant . as a consequence @xmath30 is isomorphic to @xmath32 , thereby implying that @xmath13 is a function of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 where    @xmath36    note that @xmath37 and @xmath38 . as we shall see next , the key ingredient to make the integrals on the hypersphere @xmath39 ( space - group where @xmath30 acts upon ) easier to compute comes from the fact that @xmath40 is obviously invariant under @xmath30 at every point @xmath35 .",
    "the calculational basis of grad s method applied to radiative problems is to expand the perturbative term @xmath41 with respect to @xmath34 into irreducible polynomials under the action of the little group @xmath30 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the projector onto the hyperplane normal to @xmath23 , and @xmath44 is the minkowski matrix .",
    "the former object also satisfies the identities : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "naturally , the vectorial and tensorial parts in the decomposition ( 5 ) are defined in the rest space normal to @xmath23 i.e. , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , since @xmath49 is symmetric and traceless , without loss of generality , one may assume that the same holds for @xmath50 , that is : @xmath51    on the other hand , since @xmath52 behaves like a scalar under the action of the little group @xmath30 , this means that it operates in the irreducible subspaces spanned by the irreducible polynomials in ( 5 ) as a multiple of the unit operator .",
    "it thus follows that @xmath53 = - \\omega [ \\kappa_{0 } a + \\kappa_{1 } b_{\\mu } n^{\\mu } + \\kappa_{2 } c_{\\mu \\nu } ( n^{\\mu } n^{\\nu } + { 1 \\over d } h^{\\mu \\nu } ) + ... ] \\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 @xmath55 , is the inverse of the mean free time for the process in consideration ( bulk viscosity , heat flux , shear viscosity ) . as usual",
    ", we assume that these quantities are functions solely of @xmath56 and @xmath35 .    using the transport equation ( 3 )",
    "we can express the coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath50 in terms of @xmath23 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . to do that we introduce a measure @xmath61 on the @xmath62-dimensional hypersurface @xmath63 for which @xmath61 is the unique @xmath30-invariant measure normalized as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the gamma function .",
    "this normalization is easily understood in the comoving frame .",
    "its nothing more than the `` area '' of unit @xmath62-dimensional sphere . in the above formula",
    "we have denoted the area of @xmath39 with this same symbol , but this willnot cause any misunderstanding to the reader .",
    "now , with respect to this measure , the irreducible polynomials are normalized by ( see appendix 1 )    @xmath66    @xmath67    also we have the very useful result @xmath68 for an odd number of components @xmath69 of the vector @xmath70 . from a straightforward ( although unduly long ) calculation we can get the coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 in ( 5 ) by evaluating the moments of the boltzmann equation ( 3 ) , and using the relations ( 11)-(13 ) .",

    "the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath77 of the mixture ( matter plus radiation ) is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the emt of the material component , which from now on , will be described by a perfect fluid @xmath80 and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are , respectively , the energy density and pressure . @xmath83 is the radiation emt for the equilibrium state , which may be readily evaluated to be@xcite @xmath84 or equivalently , in the standard form @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the @xmath19-dimensional radiation constant , and @xmath88 denotes the riemann zeta function .    the last term ( the integral ) in eq.(17 ) is the only out of equilibrium contribution ( due to interaction between matter and radiation ) , and can properly be interpreted as a dissipative term to the equilibrium energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 give rise to contributions of different tensorial ranks , which in the thermodynamic theory are usually named , respectively , as bulk viscosity , heat flux , and shear tensor . substituting ( 14)-(16 ) in the last integral of ( 17 ) , we get the terms :    \\a ) scalar ( bulk viscosity ) @xmath89 @xmath90",

    "in the phenomenological theory of eckart , the emt of a relativistic dissipative simple fluid reads @xmath100 where the last term is the macroscopic description of the irreversible processes .",
    "its d - dimensional canonical form is given by ( the factor 1/d appears explicitly because the shear viscosity stress is traceless ) @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are , respectively , the bulk viscosity , heat conducting , and the shear viscosity transport coefficients . in principle , the above expression should be justified by kinetic contributions like ( 22)-(24 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that all thermodynamic quantities ( explicitly or implicitly ) present in ( 26 ) are measured in the rest frame of @xmath105 .",
    "however , for a radiative plasma there are , in the collisional limit , at least three concepts of temperature@xcite . since the physical features relating these temperatures concepts are independent ( to first order in @xmath106 ) of the shear and heat conducting effects , for a moment , we will restrict our discussion to the isotropic case for which only bulk viscosity is relevant . to do that ,",
    "let us first introduce ( from the bulk viscosity contribution ( 22 ) ) the following auxiliary quantity : @xmath107 in terms of @xmath108 , the isotropic part of the total emt ( 17 ) can be written as ( see ( 22 ) ) @xmath109u^{\\mu}u^{\\nu } - [ p_{m}(t_{_{m}},n ) \\nonumber \\\\   + { 1 \\over d } a_{_{d } } t^{d+1}_{m } + { 1 \\over d } \\pi_{_{m } } ]   h^{\\mu\\nu } \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that by defining the effective radiation kinetic temperature :    @xmath110\\quad,\\ ] ]    the above emt assume the form @xmath111 which has only two standard terms , which are characteristic of the perfect fluid description .",
    "in particular , the radiation quanta behaves as if they were in equilibrium at temperature @xmath112 ( compare ( 19 ) ) .",
    "however , the difference in temperature between the material and radiative components give rise to an irreversible heat transference between them .",
    "this is the physical mechanism accounting for the bulk viscosity process in this mixture . in order to extract its analytical expression ,",
    "we recall that the eckart temperature @xmath59 is defined as being the local equilibrium temperature , which is implicitly fixed by ( see ref.@xcite ) @xmath113 since the equilibrium temperature @xmath114 $ ] , whose length @xmath115 is of first order in @xmath106 , we can expand @xmath116 as a power series @xmath117 where @xmath118 inserting ( 34 ) into ( 33 ) and comparing with ( 32 ) we get @xmath119 analogously , the total pressure @xmath120 can be expanded , to first order , as @xmath121 or still , inserting @xmath122 from ( 31 ) , and using ( 35 ) @xmath123 with the help of ( 28 ) , ( 32 ) , and ( 37 ) , the total energy - momentum tensor ( 29 ) takes the form @xmath124^{2}u^{\\lambda}_{,\\lambda}\\right\\ } h^{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] where we have used the thermodynamic relation@xcite @xmath125 and the fact that , to first order , @xmath126 can be replaced by @xmath59 when multiplied by @xmath106 .",

    "in particular , for @xmath132 , the standard results are recovered@xcite . from ( 41 )",
    "we see that structureless point particles in d - dimensions have negligible bulk viscosity in the extreme relativistic regime ( @xmath133 ) , as should be expected in physical grounds .",
    "this is also a consequence of the fact that the d - dimensional equilibrium distribution of photons is preserved under expansion , or equivalently , that the ratio @xmath134 is an adiabatic invariant in the sense of ehrenfest , regardless of the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "hence , when the universe is radiation dominated , there is no radiative bulk viscosity in the d - dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) spacetime .",
    "this generalize the widely known 3-dimensional result@xcite .",
    "in eckart s frame , the current of entropy and the local entropy production for a d - dimensional relativistic simple fluid are given by @xmath135 and @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the entropy density , and @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 are the classical dissipative stresses ( bulk viscosity , heat flow and shear viscosity ) : @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 in principle , the eckart description for a d - dimensional radiative plasma will be considered complete only if the kinetic equations lead to ( 44 ) and ( 45 ) in eckart s frame . in particular , one may argue that the above defined entropy density should be introduced , in a consistent way , by the same kind of algorithm used to fix the eckart temperature .",

    "these results are in agreement with our discussion in the earlier section",
    ". the quanta behave ( in the isotropic case ) as a radiation perfect fluid at temperature @xmath154 regardless of the number of dimensions .    now , as a self - consistency check of the algorithm used to introduce the temperature of eckart , we need only to show that the total entropy density of the mixture reduces to the equilibrium expression at the temperature t.    the total entropy of matter plus radiation is given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 is given by ( 55 ) and @xmath161 is the entropy flux of matter .",
    "since the material component is in equilibrium at temperature @xmath162 , the total entropy density can be written as ( see ( 54 ) ) @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the entropy density of the material medium . by definition of eckart s frame",
    ", the right hand side of the above equation should be @xmath165 .",

    "by considering the standard relation @xmath172 , we obtain @xmath173 thus , in eckart s temperature , the total entropy four - vector of a radiative plasma , assume the same form usually applied for a relativistic simple fluid ( see ( 44 ) ) .",

    "as we have seen , kinetic theory is indeed a very powerful approach to describe radiative plasmas irrespective of the number of spatial dimensions .",

    "such shortcomings can be circumvented by the so - called second order thermodynamic theories as developed by muller@xcite and israel @xcite . in this way , it is interesting to reconsider the kinetic treatment developed here in the framework of the causal or transient relativistic kinetic theory@xcite .",

    "as usual , one must assume that the mean free time of each process is much smaller than any typical scale of the gravitational field , and at the level of the computations , to implement the minimal coupling , viz . ; to replace the ordinary derivatives by covariant derivatives and the ( d+1)-minkowski matrix @xmath44 by @xmath211@xcite .",
    "naturally , d - gravity does not change the form of the d - dimensional transport coefficients , which should be considered in the analysis of the entropy production in high dimensional cosmologies , as well as in the role played by dissipative processes on the problem of dimensional reduction .",
    "in particular , as shown in section 3 , the radiative bulk viscosity does not play any role in a d - dimensional radiation - dominated frw universe .",
    "this generalizes the well known results obtained by weinberg in the three dimensional case@xcite .",
    "qualitatively , significant bulk viscosity may take place only if the plasma does a transition , for instance , from radiation to a matter - dominated phase .",
