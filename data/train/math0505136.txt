    "although the results and methods presented in this article come out from the graph theory , it is maybe worth mentioning that the problem itself originates from incidence structures named combinatorial configurations and dates back to 1887  @xcite .",
    "a _ symmetric combinatorial configuration _ of type @xmath2 is an incidence structure of @xmath3 points and @xmath3 blocks ( called lines ) such that each line contains @xmath4 points , each point belongs to @xmath4 lines and each two different points are contained in at most one line .",
    "one way to relate graphs and configurations is via their incidence graphs ( or levi graphs  @xcite ) .",
    "an _ incidence graph _ or _ levi graph _ of the @xmath2 configuration @xmath5 is a bipartite @xmath4-regular graph on @xmath3 _ black _ vertices representing the points of @xmath5 , @xmath3 _ white _ vertices representing the lines of @xmath5 , and with an edge joining two vertices if and only if the corresponding point and line are incident in @xmath5 .",
    "the property that two different points of a configuration are contained in at most one line implies that levi graphs have girth ( the length of the shortest cycle ) at least @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , each bipartite @xmath4-regular graph with girth at least @xmath0 and with chosen black - white coloring determines precisely one @xmath2 configuration .",
    "note that if the coloring is not chosen , such graphs determine a pair of _ dual configurations _",
    ", i.e.  configurations with the role of their points and lines interchanged .",
    "more about graphs and configurations can be found in  @xcite .    in 1887 v.  martinetti described the following construction method for symmetric @xmath1 configurations  @xcite .",
    "suppose that in the given @xmath1 configuration there exist two parallel ( non - intersecting ) lines @xmath6 and @xmath7 such that the points @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not on a common line . by removing these two lines , adding one new point @xmath10 and three new lines @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 we obtain a @xmath14 configuration .",
    "it is not possible to obtain every @xmath1 configuration from some @xmath15 configuration by using this method .",
    "we call @xmath1 configurations which can not be constructed in this way from a smaller one _ a - irreducible configurations _ and the others _ a - reducible configurations_. we use the prefix a before the term ( ir)reducible to distinguish this type of reduction from a more general one defined later in the paper .",
    "let us consider the martinetti method on levi graphs of @xmath1 configurations .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we will use , as in  @xcite , the notion _",
    "@xmath1 graph _ instead of levi graph of @xmath1 configuration , i.e.  @xmath1 graph is a bipartite cubic graph with girth @xmath16 .",
    "we define a - reducible and a - irreducible @xmath1 graphs corresponding to a - reducible and a - irreducible configurations respectively as follows .",
    "a @xmath1 graph @xmath17 is _ a - reducible _ if there exists an edge @xmath18 such that @xmath19 or @xmath20 is again a @xmath1 graph , where @xmath21 are the neighbors of @xmath22 ( different from @xmath3 ) and @xmath23 are the neighbors of @xmath3 ( different from @xmath22 ) .",
    "otherwise we call a @xmath1 graph _ a - irreducible_.    it turns out that there are four infinite families of connected a - irreducible graphs , which we present in the next section , plus the pappus graph , i.e.  the levi graph of the pappus configuration , see figure  [ fig : pappusg ] .",
    "note that martinetti in his paper did not describe all families of irreducible graphs .",
    "this was not done until  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that a slightly more general definition of a @xmath1 graph reduction ( and hence @xmath1 configuration reductions ) leaves only two irreducible graphs : the heawood graph , the levi graph of the fano configuration ( projective plane of order @xmath24 ) , and the already mentioned pappus graph .",
    "an effort in this direction was made in  2000 by h.  g.  carstens , t.  dinski , and e.  steffen  @xcite , who gave a set of quite complicated reductions to show that they lead to the heawood graph .",
    "but their claim is not entirely correct since it turns out that their reductions leave out the desargues graph too ( the levi graph of the desargues configuration )  @xcite .",
    "given a bipartite cubic graph @xmath17 , black vertex @xmath25 , and white vertex @xmath26 , let us say that we _ reduce @xmath17 by @xmath22 and @xmath3 _ if we remove @xmath22 and @xmath3 and connect their neighbours in such way that @xmath17 remains cubic and bipartite . if @xmath22 and @xmath3 are not connected then there are six ways to this , otherwise there are only two .",
    "if it is possible to reduce a @xmath1 graph @xmath17 by some pair of its vertices such that the reduced graph is again a @xmath1 graph , then we say that @xmath17 is _ b - reducible _ ; otherwise we call it _ b - irreducible_. we notice that a - reduction is only a special case of the above definition where @xmath22 and @xmath3 are neighbouring vertices .",
    "our main result says that there are not many b - irreducible @xmath1 graphs .",
    "[ thm : main ] there are only two connected b - irreducible bipartite cubic graphs with girth at least @xmath0 , the heawood graph and the pappus graph .    to prove this theorem we show that our reduction applies to all a - irreducible @xmath1 graphs but the heawood and the pappus graph .",
    "it is possible that the reduction of a connected graph makes it disconnected .",
    "so , the process of reducing a @xmath1 graph may finally result in a graph whose connected components are only the heawood and the pappus graphs .",
    "but we may state a stronger result .    [",
    "thm : reduce ] every connected @xmath1 graph can be reduced either to the heawood graph or to the pappus graph by the sequence of connected @xmath1 graphs .",
    "note that bipartite cubic graphs are 2-connected ; this follows , for example , from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.4.6 ) .",
    "hence the removal of two vertices produces at most three connected components in the general case and at most two in the case of a - reduction .",
    "if the addition of the necessary edges leaves the graph disconnected and this does not produce a @xmath27-cycle , then there also exists a choice for the addition of the edges which gives a connected graph and does not produce a @xmath27-cycle .",
    "( such a choice exists since we add @xmath28 edges in the general case and @xmath24 in the case of a - reduction . )",
