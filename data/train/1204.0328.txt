    "one of the outstanding quests in modern theoretical physics is the unification of the four fundamental forces .",
    "there have been several theories around that partly fulfill this goal , all succeeding in some ( different ) aspects of such a theory .",
    "we will give an introduction to one of them , namely noncommutative geometry .",
    "it is a bottom - up approach in that it unifies the well - established standard model of high - energy physics with einstein s general theory of relativity , thus not starting with extra dimensions , loops or strings .",
    "all this fits nicely in a mathematical framework , which was established by connes in the 1980s @xcite .",
    "of course , there is a price that one has to pay for having such a rigid mathematical basis : at present the unification has been obtained only at the classical level .",
    "the main reason for this can actually be found in any gauge theory ( such as yang - mills theory ) as well : its quantization is still waiting for a sound mathematical description .",
    "the noncommutative geometrical description of ( classical ) yang - mills theories  or the standard model , for that matter  minimally coupled to gravity encounters the same trouble in formulating the corresponding quantum theory , in addition troubled by the quantization of gravity .",
    "it needs no stressing that this situation needs to be improved ( though some progress has been made recently , see the outlook ) , and it is our hope that this review article strengthens the dialogue with for instance string theory or quantum gravity .",
    "intriguingly , noncommutative spacetimes naturally appear in the context of both of these theories . in string theory , this started with the work of seiberg and witten @xcite , in loop quantum gravity the quantized area operator is a manifestation of an underlying quantum geometry ( cf . @xcite and references therein )",
    "this has lead to a fruitful acre where ideas from the fields involved are combined : noncommutative geometry and string theory already in @xcite , see the recent account in @xcite and references therein ; noncommutative geometry and loop quantum gravity in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "even though the noncommutative description of the standard model @xcite does not require the introduction of extra spacetime dimensions , its construction is very much like the original kaluza - klein theories @xcite .",
    "in fact , one starts with a product @xmath0 of ordinary four - dimensional spacetime @xmath1 with an _ internal space _",
    "@xmath2 which is to describe the gauge content of the theory .",
    "of course , spacetime itself still describes the gravitational part .",
    "the main difference with kaluza - klein theories is that the additional space is a discrete ( zero dimensional ) space whose structure is described by a ( potentially ) _ noncommutative algebra _",
    ", the idea essentially dating back to @xcite .",
    "this is very much like the description of spacetime @xmath1 by its coordinate functions as usual in general relativity , which form an algebra under pointwise multiplication : @xmath3 such commutative relations are secretly used in any physics textbook .",
    "however , for a discrete space , there are not many coordinates so we propose to describe @xmath2 by matrices instead , yielding a much richer internal ( algebraic ) structure .",
    "multiplication is given by ordinary matrix multiplication : @xmath4 the corresponding _ matrix algebra _ of coordinates on @xmath2 is typically @xmath5 or direct sums thereof .",
    "it turns out ( and we will explain that below ) that one can also describe a metric on @xmath2 in terms of algebraic data , so that we can fully describe the geometrical structure of @xmath6 .",
    "this type of noncommutative manifolds are called _ almost - commutative ( ac ) manifolds _ , in contrast with the more serious noncommutative spaces such as the moyal plane appearing in , say , seiberg - witten theory and for which ( in contrast with the above ) @xmath7=i \\hbar.\\ ] ] we stress that this is not the type of noncommutativity that we are dealing with here .",
    "nevertheless , also such spaces fit in the framework of noncommutative geometry , see for instance @xcite for the compact and @xcite for the noncompact case .    in this review article",
    ", we will give several examples of almost - commutative manifolds of interest in physics .",
    "in fact , adopting the chronological order of ordinary high - energy physics textbooks , we will _ derive _ electrodynamics , the glashow - weinberg - salam electroweak theory , and the full standard model ( including higgs mechanism ) from noncommutative spaces .",
    "let us briefly sketch how this goes , at the same time giving an overview of the present article .",
    "given an ac manifold @xmath6 , one first studies its symmetries : it turns out that the group of diffeomorphisms ( _ i.e. _ general coordinate transformations ) generalized to such noncommutative spaces combines ordinary diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 with gauge symmetries @xcite . in other words , for the above three examples we obtain a combination of general coordinate transformations on @xmath1 with the respective groups @xmath8 , @xmath9 and finally @xmath10 , appearing as unitaries in the corresponding matrix algebras .",
    "this is the first hint at the aforementioned unification of gauge theories with gravity .",
    "all this is described at length in [ chap : acg ] below .",
    "the next step is to construct a lagrangian from the geometry of @xmath6 .",
    "this is accomplished by the _ spectral action principle _",
    "@xcite : it is a simple counting of the eigenvalues of a dirac operator on @xmath6 which are lower than a cutoff @xmath11 .",
    "this is discussed in [ chap : spectral ] , where we derive local formulas ( integrals of lagrangians ) for the spectral action using heat kernel methods ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the fermionic action is given as usual by an inner product .",
    "the lagrangians that one obtains in this way for the above examples are the right ones , and in addition minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "this is unification with gravity of electrodynamics , the glashow - weinberg - salam electroweak theory , and finally the full standard model .",
    "this is presented in the respective [ chap : ex_ed , chap : ex_gws , chap : ex_sm ] .",
    "we study conformal invariance of the spectral action in [ chap : conf ] , with particular emphasis on the higgs mechanism coupled to the gravitational background .",
    "this has already found fruitful applications in cosmology @xcite .",
    "finally , in [ chap : rge ] we present some predictions that can be derived from the noncommutative description of the standard model ( based on @xcite ) . in fact , the lagrangian derived through the spectral action principle from the relevant noncommutative space is not just the standard model lagrangian , but it implies that there are _ relations between some of the standard model couplings and masses_. this allows for a postdiction of ( an upper bound on ) the top quark mass , and a prediction of the higgs mass .",
    "we end by presenting an outlook on some future developments .",
    "the main source to the noncommutative description of the standard model is @xcite or , for the more mathematically inclined reader , the book @xcite , on which our discussion is heavily based .",
    "however , we attempt to make this material more accessible to theoretical physicists by adopting a light version of noncommutative geometry and describing separately the electromagnetic and -weak theory .",
    "the case of electrodynamics was first formulated in noncommutative terms only quite recently in @xcite .",
    "there are also some shorter companions on the applications of noncommutative geometry to high - energy physics such as @xcite and @xcite .    for more general treatments on noncommutative geometry , presented in its full mathematical glory",
    ", we refer to @xcite or the original @xcite .",
    "one of the central ideas in connes noncommutative geometry @xcite is to characterize ordinary riemannian manifolds by a spectral data . by generalizing this spectral data in a suitable way ,",
    "one arrives at the notion of a _ noncommutative manifold_. within this generalization , we will focus on the special case of what is called an _ almost - commutative manifold_. this special case is given by the ` noncommutative - geometric product ' @xmath12 of a riemannian manifold @xmath1 and a _ finite space _ @xmath2 as described in the next section .",
    "before we are ready to provide a description of an almost - commutative manifold , let us first focus on a reformulation of the description of an ordinary riemannian manifold .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of a compact @xmath13-dimensional riemannian spin manifold @xmath1 .",
    "the restriction on the dimension is just for notational simplicity and by no means essential ; the @xmath14-dimensional case can readily be obtained .",
    "our aim in this section is to illustrate how one replaces the usual topological and geometric description of @xmath1 by a spectral data in terms of operators on a hilbert space . in the next section",
    ", we will see that this spectral description of manifolds also perfectly lends itself for the description of so - called finite spaces , and subsequently of almost - commutative manifolds .",
    "the first step in noncommutative geometry is to shift our focus from the manifold @xmath1 towards the coordinate functions on @xmath1 .",
    "we will thus consider the set of smooth ( infinitely differentiable ) functions @xmath15 .",
    "these functions form an algebra under pointwise multiplication . as said , we restrict our attention to a spin manifold @xmath1 , so that we may also consider the spinor bundle @xmath16 , and spinor fields on @xmath1",
    "are then given by ( smooth ) sections @xmath17 .",
    "we will consider the hilbert space @xmath18 of square - integrable spinors on @xmath1 .",
    "the algebra @xmath19 acts on @xmath20 as multiplication operators by pointwise scalar multiplication @xmath21 for a function @xmath22 and a spinor field @xmath23 .    using the spin ( levi  civita ) connection @xmath24 on the spinor bundle @xmath25",
    ", we can describe the _ dirac operator _ @xmath26 . in local coordinates , @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 , in terms of the dirac gamma matrices @xmath28 .",
    "the dirac operator acts as a first - order differential operator on the spinors @xmath17 .",
    "the spin connection satisfies the leibniz rule @xmath29 for all functions @xmath30 and all spinors @xmath31 . for the commutator",
    "@xmath32 $ ] acting as an operator on @xmath23 , we then calculate @xmath33 \\psi & = -i\\gamma^\\mu\\nabla^s_\\mu(f\\psi ) + i f",
    "\\gamma^\\mu\\nabla^s_\\mu \\psi = -i \\gamma^\\mu ( \\partial_\\mu f ) \\psi .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore we see that the action of @xmath32 $ ] is simply given by multiplication with @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , this means that although @xmath26 is an unbounded operator , the commutator @xmath32 $ ] is always a bounded operator for any smooth function @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , this bounded operator is given by the clifford representation of the @xmath35-form @xmath36 .",
    "let us gather all data described here so far into the following definition .",
    "[ defn : canon_triple ] let @xmath1 be a compact @xmath13-dimensional riemannian spin manifold .",
    "the _ canonical triple _ is given by the set of data @xmath37 furthermore , we also have a @xmath38-_grading _ @xmath39 , and an antilinear isomorphism @xmath40 , which is the _ charge conjugation _ operator on the spinors .",
    "the operator @xmath41 is a @xmath38-grading , which means that @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath41 decomposes the hilbert space @xmath44 into a positive and a negative eigenspace : chirality . with respect to this grading",
    ", the dirac operator is an _ odd _",
    "operator , which means that @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , we have @xmath46 . for the charge conjugation operator @xmath40 , one obtains the relations @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it turns out that a compact riemannian spin manifold @xmath1 can be fully described by this canonical triple @xcite .",
    "the canonical triple is the motivating example for the definition of so - called spectral triples ( see [ remark : spectral_triple ] ) , and as such it lies at the foundation of noncommutative geometry .",
    "the claim that a riemannian spin manifold @xmath1 is fully described by the canonical triple suggests that we are able to recover the _ riemannian geometry _ of @xmath1 from the data given with the canonical triple .",
    "we shall illustrate how this works by considering the notion of distance .",
    "the usual geodesic distance between two points @xmath50 and @xmath51 in @xmath1 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and the infimum is taken over all paths @xmath54 from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , with parametrizations such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "let us confront this formula with the following distance formula in terms of the data in the canonical triple : @xmath57\\|\\leq1 \\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because we take a supremum over functions that locally have ` slope ' less than or equal to 1 , we can indeed measure the riemannian distance between two points in this dual manner .",
    "full details can be found in e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the geometric structure of @xmath1 is captured into the dirac operator @xmath26 .",
    "later on , we will use to generalize the geodesic distance to a notion of distance on almost - commutative manifolds .",
    "it has been noted in @xcite that this distance formula , in the case of locally compact complete manifolds , is in fact a reformulation of the wasserstein distance in the theory of optimal transport .",
    "[ remark : lorentz ] we stress that the spin manifolds that can be captured in this way are riemannian and not pseudo - riemannian . in particular , this leaves out lorentzian manifolds , which are of particular interest in physics .",
    "the reason for this is that dealing with dirac operators on pseudo - riemannian manifolds is technically difficult , since one loses the property of these being elliptic operators .",
    "some progress in this direction has been obtained in @xcite though this program is far from being completed .      in the previous section we have provided an alternative algebraic description of a spin manifold @xmath1 in terms of the canonical triple @xmath58 , following connes @xcite . in this section",
    "we will define the notion of an almost - commutative manifold as a generalization of spin manifolds .",
    "such manifolds already appeared in the work of connes and lott @xcite and around the same time in a series of papers by dubois - violette , kerner and madore @xcite , who studied the noncommutative differential geometry for the algebra of functions tensored with a matrix algebra , and its relevance to the description of gauge and higgs fields .",
    "almost - commutative manifolds were later used by chamseddine , connes and marcolli @xcite to geometrically describe yang - mills theories and the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "the name almost - commutative manifolds was coined in @xcite , their classification started in @xcite ( see also the more recent @xcite ) .    the general idea is to take the ` product ' @xmath12 of the spin manifold @xmath1 with some finite space @xmath2 , which in general may be noncommutative .",
    "whereas the canonical triple encodes the structure of the spacetime @xmath1 , the finite space @xmath2 will be used to encode the ` internal degrees of freedom ' at each point in spacetime .",
    "the main goal of this section is to show how these internal degrees of freedom will lead to the description of a gauge theory on @xmath1 .",
    "analogously to our description of a spin manifold @xmath1 , we will describe a ( generally noncommutative ) _ finite space _ @xmath2 by a triple @xmath59 here we now have a finite - dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath60 , say of dimension @xmath61 .",
    "the algebra @xmath62 is a ( real or complex ) matrix algebra , which acts on the hilbert space via matrix multiplication .",
    "the operator @xmath63 is given by a complex @xmath64-matrix acting on @xmath60 , and @xmath63 is required to be hermitian .",
    "consider the matrix algebra @xmath65 of @xmath66 matrices acting on itself by left matrix multiplication , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath67 .",
    "the operator @xmath63 is simply a hermitian @xmath68 matrix , @xmath69 being the dimension of @xmath60 .",
    "suppose that the hilbert space @xmath60 is @xmath38-graded , i.e.  there exists a grading operator @xmath70 for which @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this grading operator decomposes the hilbert space @xmath73 into its two eigenspaces , where @xmath74 .",
    "if such a grading operator exists , we say that the finite space @xmath2 is _ even _ if furthermore we have @xmath75=0 $ ] for all @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "in other words , for an even finite space we require that the elements of the algebra are even operators and that @xmath63 is an odd operator .",
    "thus , in the above example , a grading @xmath78 would force @xmath63 to vanish .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact @xmath13-dimensional spin manifold .",
    "we will now take the ` noncommutative - geometric product ' of @xmath1 with some even finite space @xmath2 as described above .",
    "the resulting product space @xmath12 is called an almost - commutative ( spin ) manifold , or ac - manifold , and provides a generalization of compact riemannian spin manifolds to the mildly noncommutative world .",
    "an _ even almost - commutative ( spin ) manifold _ , or ac - manifold , is described by @xmath79 together with a grading @xmath80 .",
    "the operator @xmath81 is called the _ dirac operator _ of the almost - commutative manifold .    the canonical triple describing a spin manifold @xmath1 , is a special case of an almost - commutative manifold @xmath12 . indeed , if we take for the finite space @xmath2 the simple choice @xmath82 , then the almost - commutative manifold @xmath12 is identical to the canonical triple for @xmath1 .",
    "this can be interpreted as taking the product of @xmath1 with a single point : the functions on the point constitute the algebra @xmath83 , the spinor fields on the points form @xmath83 and the dirac operator can not be anything else but 0 .",
