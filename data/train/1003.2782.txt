    "it is well known that commuting matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable .",

    "this operation maximizes the minimum determinant and hence the coding gain .",
    "so , the real symbols of the rate-1 , 4-group decodable code are encoded by grouping @xmath186 real symbols into 4 groups and each group of symbols taking value from a unitarily rotated vector belonging to @xmath187 , the rotation matrix being @xmath188 .",
    "the ml - decoding complexity of the code is @xmath189 , where @xmath5 is the size of the complex signal constellation .",

    ", the elements of @xmath197 can be used as weight matrices of a full - rate stbc for @xmath193 .",
    "keeping in view that the ergodic capacity depends on as many non - diagonal entries of the @xmath21-matrix being zeros , it is important to choose the weight matrices prudently .",
    "the idea is that given a full - rate stbc for @xmath198 receive antennas , obtain the additional weight matrices of a full - rate stbc for @xmath1 receive antennas by using the weight matrices of a rate-1 , 4-group decodable stbc such that the after addition of the new weight matrices , the set of weight matrices is linearly independent over @xmath31 .",
    "this is achieved as follows .    1 .",
    "obtain a rate-1 , 4-group decodable stbc by using the construction method detailed in section [ sec4 ] . due to the nature of construction ,",
    "the product of any two weight matrices is always some other weight matrix of the code , up to negation .",
    "denote the set of weight matrices by @xmath86 .",

    "the weight matrices of @xmath87 form a new , rate-1 , 4-group decodable stbc .",
    "this is because the ml - decoding complexity does not change by multiplying the weight matrices of a code with a unitary weight matrix . in this case , we have multiplied the elements of @xmath86 with an element of @xmath199 , which is a unitary matrix .",
