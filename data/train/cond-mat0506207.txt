    "heavy fermions started out as a fertile ground to study strongly correlated fermi liquids and superconductors .",
    "@xcite there was a great deal of amazement at seeing a fermi liquid whose quasiparticle mass is over a hundred times the bare electron mass ; hence the name of the field .",
    "it was also surprising to find superconductors in an inherently magnetic environment : the existence of local magnetic moments in these materials is established through the observation of a curie - weiss susceptibility at intermediate temperatures ( of the order of 100 k ) , and magnetism is supposed to be `` hostile '' to superconductivity .",
    "it was qualitatively understood that the large mass reflects the kondo screening of the magnetic moments , which is necessary to overcome magnetism ,  @xcite and the proper theoretical description of the fermi liquid state  @xcite was subsequently achieved . when high temperature superconductors were discovered in 1986 , the development of the heavy fermion field was naturally interrupted  at least partially .",
    "the hiatus proved to be relatively short - lived . as it re - emerged , however , the field acquired a considerably different outlook , with the emphasis now placed on non - fermi liquid behavior and magnetic quantum phase transitions . since the late 1990s",
    "the field has become a focal point  @xcite for the general study of quantum criticality .",
    "the interest in qcps is by no means unique to heavy fermions ; it also arises in high temperature superconductors among other materials .",
    "@xcite however , heavy fermions are particularly advantageous in one important regard .",
    "that is , second - order quantum phase transitions are explicitly observed in a growing list of this family of materials .",
    "the qcp in heavy fermions typically separates an antiferromagnetic metallic phase from a paramagnetic metallic phase . near the magnetic qcp",
    ", transport and thermodynamical properties develop anomalies .",
    "the @xmath2 sdw picture  @xcite describes the qcp in terms of fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter ",
    "the paramagnons  both in space and in time .",
    "this theory amounts to a @xmath3 theory  with @xmath4 being the paramagnon field  in an effective dimensionality of @xmath5 . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the dynamic exponent , and is equal to @xmath7 in the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "so , @xmath8 is above the upper critical dimension , @xmath9 , of the @xmath3 theory , for spatial dimensions @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding fixed point is gaussian . in this picture , the non - fermi liquid properties of the qcp reflect the singular scattering of electrons by the paramagnons and are unrelated to the process of kondo screening .    the most direct indication for the unusual nature of the heavy fermion quantum criticality came from inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "@xcite the magnetic dynamics shows a fractional exponent and @xmath0 scaling over an extended range of momentum space .",
    "these features deviate drastically from the expectations of the sdw theory .",
    "since the sdw critical fixed point is gaussian , spin damping would be controlled by some ( dangerously ) irrelevant coupling , and neither fractional exponent nor @xmath0 scaling would be expected .",
    "one way to resolve this impasse invokes the breakdown of kondo screening at the magnetic quantum critical point . on the paramagnetic side ,",
    "local moments become entangled with the conduction electrons and , in the process , are delocalized and a part of the electron fluid . at the magnetic qcp , the magnetic fluctuations turn soft and act as a source of dissipation that couples to the local moments ; this coupling competes with the kondo interactions and destroys the kondo screening . going from the paramagnetic side to the qcp ,",
    "the electronic excitations depart from those of a fermi liquid and acquire a non - fermi liquid form .",
    "these non - fermi liquid excitations are part of the quantum critical spectrum . unlike the paramagnons , they are characterized by an interacting fixed point . as the control parameter",
    "is tuned further , into the magnetically ordered side , the system is again a fermi liquid , but the kondo effect is completely destroyed . an important corollary of this picture  @xcite is that the fermi surface has a sharp jump at the qcp .    to microscopically study",
    "the magnetic quantum phase transition requires an approach that can handle not only the heavy fermion and magnetic states but also the dynamical competition between the two on an equal footing .",
    "one suitable approach ( if not the only one so far ) is the extended dynamical mean field theory ( edmft ) .",
    "@xcite    in this article , we discuss the edmft studies of the kondo lattice system .",
    "in addition to a brief summary of the earlier analytical works ,  @xcite we will pay particular attention to two issues .",
    "the first one deals with the magnetic dynamics near the qcp .",
    "a fractional dynamical - spin - susceptibility exponent accompanies the destruction of kondo screening .",
    "@xcite the second one concerns the nature of the zero - temperature transition .",
    "when the edmft is implemented such that there is no double - counting of the static component of the rkky interactions , the transition turns out to be second order .",
    "@xcite we compare these results with those of some recent related works .  @xcite",
    "we consider a kondo lattice model , @xmath11 here , the @xmath12-electron component @xmath13 describes the interactions between spin-@xmath14 local moments and @xmath15 are the spin projections .",
    "we have taken the valence fluctuations to be completely frozen , which should be a good description of at least those heavy fermion metals that have a heavy effective mass and that are undergoing a magnetic quantum phase transition . without loss of generality",
    ", we have assumed that a unit cell contains one local moment ( @xmath16 ) , whose spin-@xmath14 nature reflects the projection onto the lowest kramers doublet .",
    "@xmath17 describes the rkky exchange interaction between the local moments . in the physical systems ,",
    "the rkky interaction is generated by the kondo interactions .",
    "here , we have taken it as an independent parameter , for two reasons .",
    "first , it is useful to do so for the purpose of specifying the global phase diagram .",
    "second , as it will be seen below , in the edmft approach to kondo lattice , it is necessary to include this parameter at the hamiltonian level to treat its effects dynamically ( see sections [ paramagnetic ] and [ ordered ] for details ) .",
    "the conduction electron component of eq .  ( [ kondo - lattice ] ) is simply @xmath18 it is implicitly assumed that the conduction electrons alone would form a fermi liquid , and the residual interaction ( landau ) parameters for the conduction - electron component alone can be neglected .",
    "we will consider the number of conduction electrons per unit cell , @xmath19 , to be in the range @xmath20 ; in addition , we will assume that it is not too small , so that the physical rkky interaction between the nearest - neighboring local moments is antiferromagnetic , and not too close to @xmath21 , so that the kondo insulating physics does not come into play .",
    "all the phases described below are metallic .    finally , the local moments interact with @xmath22 , the spins of the conduction electrons , through an antiferromagnetic kondo coupling @xmath23 : @xmath24      for qualitative considerations , consider the kondo lattice model with a fixed value of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with a small ratio @xmath27 ; here @xmath25 is the typical ( say , nearest - neighbor ) interaction of @xmath28 , and @xmath26 the conduction - electron bandwidth .",
    "we further assume that @xmath29 has an ising anisotropy . in the antiferromagnetic phase of @xmath28",
    ", the spin excitation spectrum is fully gapped .",
    "an infinitesimal @xmath23 can not lead to any kondo screening .",
    "hence , the fermi surface encloses only the conduction electrons , whose number is @xmath19 per paramagnetic unit cell .",
    "we label this phase af@xmath30 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath23 dominates over @xmath25 , the standard kondo screening does occur .",
    "each local moment is converted into a spin-@xmath14 charge @xmath31 kondo resonance .",
    "the fermi surface now encloses not only the conduction electrons but also the local moments , the total number being @xmath32 per unit cell .",
    "we label this phase pm@xmath33 .",
    "while the existence of this phase is well - established ,  @xcite the easiest physical way to see it is to consider the limit @xmath34 .",
    "[ since the kondo state restores @xmath35 symmetry , we have , without loss of generality , taken the kondo exchange coupling to be spin - isotropic in eq .",
    "( [ h - k ] ) . ] in this limit , there is a large binding energy ( of the order @xmath36 ) for a local singlet between @xmath37 and @xmath22 , and we can safely project to this singlet subspace . in this subspace , @xmath38 becomes special : here each local moment is locally paired up with a conduction electron , and the entire system becomes a kondo insulator . for a system of total @xmath39 unit cells ,",
    "an @xmath40 amounts to creating @xmath41 unpaired local moments , each of which is equivalent to creating a hole in the singlet background .",
    "the kondo lattice model becomes equivalent to an effective single band hubbard model of @xmath42 holes per site , with an infinite on - site repulsion ( it is impossible to create two holes  there is only one electron in the singlet to begin with ) .",
    "@xcite in the paramagnetic phase , the luttinger theorem then ensures that the fermi volume contains @xmath42 holes or , equivalently , @xmath43",
    "electrons!.    these general arguments show that the af@xmath30 and pm@xmath33 phases are two stable metallic phases .",
    "they differ in two important regards . the af@xmath30 is magnetically ordered while the pm@xmath44 is not . equally important , the pm@xmath33 has the kondo screening while the af@xmath30 does not .",
    "increasing the ratio @xmath45 takes the system from af@xmath30 to pm@xmath44 .",
    "a key question is this : does the destruction of magnetism and the onset of kondo screening occur at the same stage ?",
    "if so , the transition is distinctly different from the @xmath2 sdw picture . if not ",
    "i.e. _ , if the destruction of magnetism happens after the kondo screening has already set in  then the magnetic transition can be interpreted as an sdw instability of the quasiparticles near the large fermi surface ; the transition goes back to the realm of the @xmath2 sdw transition picture .",
    "microscopical studies provide a way to address this issue .",
    "a suitable method has to capture not only the af@xmath30 and pm@xmath33 phases , due respectively to the rkky exchange interactions and the kondo interactions , but also the dynamical competition between these interactions ; this dynamical interplay is crucial for the transition region . at this stage ,",
    "the edmft method is the only one we are aware of which fits this requirement .",
    "of course , microscopic studies always have limitations .",
    "approximations are inevitably used , in the process of solving a hamiltonian or at the level of the model itself ( or both ) . controlled approximations , nonetheless , provide us with not only ways of understanding experiments but also intuitions that serve as a basis for more macroscopic approaches .",
    "this general philosophy is readily reflected in the edmft approach .",
    "even though it is `` conserving '' ( _ i.e. _ , satisfying thermodynamic consistency requirements ) , it assumes that the @xmath46-dependences of some irreducible single - electron and collective quantities [ @xmath47 and @xmath48 defined in the next section ] are unimportant .",
    "there are several reasons to believe that the edmft approach is useful for the antiferromagnetic quantum transitions at hand .",
    "first , because staggered magnetization is not a conserved quantity , the spin damping does not have to acquire a strong dependence on @xmath49 .",
    "this is especially true in metallic systems , where the dynamic exponent @xmath6 associated with the long - wavelength magnetic fluctuations is larger than 1 . in the sdw case ,",
    "@xcite for instance , @xmath50 and @xmath51 can simply be taken as a linear function of @xmath52 without any singular dependence on @xmath46 . whether the @xmath46-dependence in @xmath51 is singular or regular",
    "can be stated in terms of the anomalous spatial dimension @xmath53 characterizing the long - wavelength fluctuations in space : a non - zero @xmath53 means that the @xmath46 dependence in @xmath51 is more singular than that [ @xmath54 already incorporated in @xmath55 .",
    "so , if @xmath56 , the edmft is expected to fail , at least for the asymptotic behavior . for instance , the classical critical points associated with a finite temperature magnetic transition in @xmath57 must have a finite @xmath53 ; the edmft turns out to produce ( an artificial ) first - order phase transition .",
    "for a quantum critical point , on the other hand , long - wavelength fluctuations occur in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "there is then a greater likelihood for the vanishing of the spatial anomalous dimension , in which case the @xmath46-dependence of @xmath51 is not singular and neglecting it will not change the universal behavior .",
    "second , as we have already discussed , the different classes of magnetic quantum critical points of a kondo lattice can be classified in terms of whether the fermi surface ( in the paramagnetic zone ) , which is large in the paramagnetic metallic phase , stays large as the qcp is crossed or becomes small by ejecting the local moments .",
    "such large _ vs. _ small fermi surfaces are well described in terms of whether the kondo effect is preserved or destroyed , which , in turn , are readily captured by the edmft approach .",
    "we now turn to the edmft studies of the kondo lattice model .",
    "the edmft approach treats certain intersite ( coherent and incoherent ) collective effects on an equal footing with the local interaction effects .",
    "the edmft equations have been constructed in terms of a `` cavity '' method ,  @xcite diagrammatics ,  @xcite and a functional formalism .",
    "@xcite all of these constructions yield the same dynamical equations . in the diagrammatic language , the edmft is seen as entirely different from a systematic expansion  @xcite in @xmath58 whose zero - th order would correspond to the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "@xcite instead , the edmft is a re - summation scheme that incorporates an infinite series of processes associated with the intersite collective effects , in addition to the local processes already taken into account in the dmft . unlike the single - electron properties , the collective modes",
    "do not have a chemical potential .",
    "in other words , the bottom of a `` band '' is important and this provides a means for spatial dimensionality to come into play in the edmft .    within the edmft ,",
    "the collective effects are organized in terms of an explicit intersite interaction term at the hamiltonian level . for the kondo lattice model described in the previous section ,",
    "this is the intersite exchange term , @xmath59 of eq .",
    "( [ h - f ] ) .",
    "there are several ways to see the details of this formalism .",
    "one way is to focus on a spin cumulant ,  @xcite whose inverse , @xmath47 , is colloquially referred to as a spin self - energy matrix . while it can be rigorously defined for any spinful many - body problem , this quantity",
    "is taken as @xmath46-independent in the edmft .    the dynamical spin susceptibility , on the other hand",
    ", is @xmath46-dependent and is given by @xmath60 the conduction electron self - energy is still given by @xmath48 , and the conduction electron green s function retains the standard form , @xmath61 the irreducible quantities , @xmath47 and @xmath62 , are determined in terms of a self - consistent bose - fermi kondo model : @xmath63 the self - consistency reflects the translational invariance : @xmath64 \\label{self - consistent } \\\\[-1ex ] g_{{loc } } ( \\omega ) & = & \\sum_{\\bf k } g ( { \\bf k } , \\omega ) \\;. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when combined with the dyson equations , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 $ ] and @xmath68 , are the weiss fields , these self - consistency equations specify the dispersions , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and the coupling constant @xmath71",
    ".    we will focus on the case of two - dimensional magnetic fluctuations , characterized by the rkky density of states @xmath72 .",
    "the first of eq .",
    "( [ self - consistent ] ) becomes @xmath73 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & i + 2i \\exp \\left [ -2i { \\chi_{\\rm loc}^a(\\omega ) } \\right ] + \\cdots \\;. \\label{m - expansion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality is an expansion in terms of @xmath74 $ ] , valid when the local susceptibility is divergent .",
    "both the kondo screening and its destruction are encoded in the bose - fermi kondo model , eq .",
    "( [ h - imp ] ) . the antiferromagnetic kondo coupling ( @xmath23 ) is responsible for the formation of a kondo singlet in the ground state and the concomitant generation of a kondo resonance in the excitation spectrum .",
    "the coupling of the local moment to the dissipative bosonic bath ( @xmath71 ) provides a competing mechanism . to see this in some detail",
    ", we first analyze eq .",
    "( [ h - imp ] ) alone without worrying about the self - consistency conditions .",
    "we consider a given spectrum of the bosonic bath , @xmath75 \\propto |\\omega|^{1-\\epsilon } { \\rm sgn } \\omega \\;. \\label{bosonic - bath}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the problem can be studied using an @xmath1-expansion .",
    "@xcite for small @xmath71 , the kondo coupling dominates , leading to a kondo screening .",
    "a sufficiently large coupling @xmath71 destroys the kondo screening completely , reaching a local - moment phase .",
    "the transition between these two phases is of second - order , and is described by a qcp where the kondo screening is just destroyed and the electronic excitations have a non - fermi liquid form .",
    "the local spin susceptibility has a pauli form on the kondo side .",
    "the destruction of kondo screening is then manifested in a divergent local susceptibility at the qcp .",
    "an important property that is shared by the bose - fermi kondo model with @xmath35 spin symmetry , @xmath76 spin anisotropy , or ising spin anisotropy , is that @xmath77 , at the qcp . here , @xmath15 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for the @xmath35 , @xmath76 , and ising cases , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath80 while the critical amplitude , @xmath81 , depends on the spin anisotropy , the critical exponent does not ; it is equal to @xmath82 in all cases",
    ".    there is an important point that follows from the above analysis which we will use in the following discussion of the numerical results . within the edmft approach to the kondo lattice ,",
    "if the local spin susceptibility of the kondo lattice model is divergent at the magnetic qcp , the corresponding local problem is sitting on the critical manifold .",
    "in other words , a divergent local susceptibility is a signature of the critical kondo screening and its associated non - fermi liquid electronic excitations .",
    "these @xmath1-expansion results for the bose - fermi kondo model were initially used to study the full self - consistent problem ,  @xcite with the self - consistency conditions specified in the previous section . the fact that the critical exponent for the local susceptibility is equal to @xmath82 [ eq .  ( [ chi - qcp ] ) ] turns out to be essential for the existence of a local qcp solution .",
    "the self - consistent solution in the case of two - dimensional magnetic fluctuations has @xmath83 , corresponding [ eq .",
    "( [ chi - qcp ] ) ] to a logarithmically divergent local susceptibility .      the edmft equations in the ising case ( taking only the @xmath79 component ) were studied numerically in ref .   using the quantum monte carlo method of grempel and rozenberg .",
    "@xcite    it was found that , at the magnetic qcp , the local spin susceptibility is indeed logarithmically divergent .",
    "figure  [ chi - tau ] shows a log - log plot of the local spin susceptibility @xmath84 _ vs. _ @xmath85 at a relatively low temperature ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "it is seen from the figure that the zero - temperature limit of the local susceptibility is @xmath87 .",
    "this corresponds to a frequency dependence that is logarithmically divergent in the low - frequency limit .",
    "a fit of the data yields the value of the amplitude @xmath88 that is directly related to the critical exponent of the peak value of the lattice susceptibility .",
    "figure  [ chi - omega ] shows the logarithmic dependence of @xmath89 directly , for frequencies smaller than the bare kondo scale @xmath90 . as already mentioned in the previous subsection , such a divergent local susceptibility signifies that the bose - fermi kondo model is located on the critical manifold ; correspondingly , there is a destruction of kondo screening at the magnetic qcp of the kondo lattice model .    from the divergent local susceptibility",
    ", the self - consistency equation  ( [ m - expansion ] ) also determines the spin self - energy and , by extension , the dynamical spin susceptibility of the kondo lattice .",
    "the inverse peak susceptibility , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the ordering wavevector , is shown in fig .",
    "[ peak - suscep ] .",
    "a power - law fit yields a dynamical spin susceptibility exponent that is fractional , close to @xmath93 .",
    "the fractional critical exponent is only seen at @xmath94 .",
    "likewise , the fermi - liquid ( linear in @xmath95 ) damping inside the paramagnetic phase is also seen only at frequencies up to at most @xmath90 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the above results with those of ref .  , which studied an anderson lattice model .",
    "the lowest temperature studied in ref .",
    "is @xmath96 .",
    "the first non - zero matsubara frequency , @xmath97 , is already larger than @xmath90 . as a result , neither the fractional exponent at the critical coupling @xmath98 nor the linear damping at @xmath99 can be observed .",
    "it is tempting to consider the bose - fermi kondo model as equivalent to a local @xmath3 theory .",
    "one maps the kondo coupling to an ising chain ( along the imaginary time @xmath100 axis ) with @xmath101 interactions .",
    "@xcite in addition , the bosonic bath , with a spectrum of eq .  ( [ bosonic - bath ] ) , adds an additional retarded interaction , @xmath102 .",

    "two of us  @xcite showed that , while the destruction of kondo screening does occur , the fractional exponent is absent .",
    "subsequently , pankov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this conclusion remains valid to order @xmath109 .",
    "recent works have considerably clarified the limitations of the large @xmath106 limit and demonstrated the failure of the local @xmath3 description of the bose - fermi kondo model , at least for @xmath110 ( including the case of the self - consistent @xmath83 ) . for the local-@xmath3 theory ,",
    "@xmath111 is the `` upper critical dimension '' .",
    "@xcite at @xmath112 , the critical point would then be gaussian , implying violations of both @xmath0 scaling and hyperscaling . a number of recent studies on the bose - fermi kondo and closely related impurity models  @xcite ,",
    "have shown that the quantum critical point is interacting over the entire range @xmath113 , obeying @xmath0 scaling and hyperscaling .",
    "these results support the observation  @xcite of @xmath0 scaling in the ( self - consistent ) case of @xmath83 .",
    "they also imply that the bose - fermi kondo model is perhaps the simplest model in which the standard description of a qcp  in terms of a classical critical point in elevated dimensions  fails .",
    "physically , the kondo effect , involving the formation of a kondo singlet , is intrinsically quantum - mechanical . in the language of a path integral representation for spin , the kondo singlet formation necessarily involves the berry phase term .",
    "it is then natural for the destruction of kondo screening to be inherently quantum mechanical and , by extension , for the qcp of the bose - fermi kondo model to be different from its classical counterpart at a higher dimension .",
    "a more in - depth understanding of the underlying mechanism for this effect will surely be illuminating .",
    "we now address whether the above results , derived from the paramagnetic side , are pre - empted by magnetic ordering .",
    "to do so , we approach the transition from the ordered side .      the edmft equations for the antiferromagnetically ordered phase require normal ordering  @xcite of @xmath28 : @xmath114 , where the normal - ordered operator is @xmath115 . the effective impurity model and the self - consistency conditions are similar to eqs .

    "we avoided double - counting the rkky interactions by working with a featureless conduction electron band ; in this case , the magnetism is driven by the interaction @xmath55 already incorporated at the hamiltonian level ( in @xmath29 ) .",

    "there is a major limitation to this approach .",
    "the rkky interaction , being zero at generic wavevectors , does not have enough phase space to dynamically interplay with the kondo interaction .",
    "so the self - consistent dynamical equations of dmft does not incorporate @xmath141 at all , and the kondo screening is always present including at the magnetic qcp .",

    "this requirement ( @xmath170 ) was achieved in ref .   by using a featureless conduction - electron band .",
    "the latter ensures that all wavevectors are generic in the sense defined earlier . within this procedure ,",
    "the magnetic ordering is entirely driven by @xmath55 , and the instability criteria from the paramagnetic and ordered sides coincide .",
    "therefore , the quantum transition is naturally of second order , as was indeed seen numerically in ref .",
    "; see fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram ] above .",
    "the procedure used in refs .   and   amounts , in our language , to keeping @xmath171 while @xmath172 . on the paramagnetic side , all wavevectors , including the ordering wavevector @xmath92 , are taken as generic , and @xmath171 , as in all edmft schemes .",
    "on the ordered side , @xmath92 is considered as one of the special wavevectors in the sense defined earlier and , through the conduction electron unit - cell doubling , @xmath172 ( as in dmft ) .",
    "the ordered side then has an added energy gain , and the magnetic quantum transition is of first order .",
    "( that an edmft approach to kondo lattices which incorporates a dmft - like fermion bubble on the ordered side alone yields a first order transition at zero temperature was in fact already recognized in @xcite . ) the procedure would actually lead to a first - order magnetic transition at zero - temperature in any itinerant model , including any @xmath2 sdw transition without any kondo physics .",
    "we close by noting that the different edmft schemes that we have discussed can be equivalently seen as different local approximations to a baym - kadanoff - type functional .",
    "an important manifestation of the destruction of the kondo screening is that @xmath12-electrons participate in the fermi volume on the paramagnetic side but fails to do so on the antiferromagnetic side .",
    "there is a sudden reconstruction of the fermi surface across the magnetic qcp .",
    "fairly direct electronic evidence for this effect has appeared in the recent hall - effect measurement in ybrh@xmath173si@xmath174 .",
    "@xcite the hall coefficient shows a rapid crossover as a function of the control parameter  magnetic field in this case .",
    "the crossover sharpens as temperature is lowered , extrapolating to a jump in the zero - temperature limit .",

    "@xcite ( on the other hand , the sdw behavior is observed in the magnetic dynamics of ce(ru@xmath178rh@xmath179)@xmath180si@xmath180 ,  @xcite which has quasi-3d magnetic fluctuations . )",
    "related non - trivial scaling exponents  that are relatively easy to connect with theory  have come from the grneisen ratio .",
    "@xcite    theoretically , there have also been efforts to study the kondo lattice systems using certain mixed - boson - fermion representations for the local - moment spin operators .",
    "@xcite such auxiliary - particle representations set up the basis for a picture with spin - charge separation .",
    "however , it has been hard to use this formalism to properly capture the kondo - screened fermi liquid phase ,  @xcite making it difficult to study its destruction as well .",
    "it may also be possible to describe the destruction of kondo screening in terms of the static mean field theories based on slave boson and an rvb order parameter , supplemented by gauge - field fluctuations .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram has recently been studied in some detail .",
    "@xcite the magnetic transition and destruction of kondo screening are found to occur at different places in the zero - temperature phase diagram ,  @xcite so the magnetic quantum transition is still of the sdw type .",
    "we believe that this is a reflection of the static nature of the mean field theory .    finally , it is instructive to put in the present context the qcp proposed for the transition from an antiferromagnet to a valence - bond solid in frustrated quantum magnets .",
    "@xcite dubbed a `` deconfined '' qcp , it has certain properties that may be qualitatively compared with the local quantum criticality : the qcp  containing exotic excitations  is surrounded by two conventional phases , and the corresponding energy scales of both vanish as the qcp is approached .",
    "hence , it would be enlightening to explore the concrete connections ( if any ) of this approach with the physics of the destruction of kondo screening . for this purpose",
    ", it would be necessary to either construct microscopic spin models for the deconfined qcp or reformulate the kondo screening beyond microscopic approaches .",
    "to summarize , we have discussed some of the microscopic approaches underlying the local quantum critical picture . beyond the initial studies based on an @xmath181expansion renormalization group method ,",
    "the most extensive investigations have been carried out in kondo lattice models with ising anisotropy .",
    "the latter have allowed the study of both the destruction of kondo screening and the concomitant fractional exponent and @xmath0 scaling in the magnetic dynamics .",
    "we have also discussed the magnetic phase diagram and summarized the evidence for the second order nature of the magnetic quantum phase transition .",
    "the edmft studies of kondo lattice models with continuous spin symmetry [ @xmath35 or @xmath76 ] are mostly confined to the @xmath1-expansion studies .",

    "has recently been shown to be promising .",
    "@xcite    the microscopic approaches described here have shown that critical modes beyond the order parameter fluctuations exist , and the modes are associated with the destruction of kondo screening .",
    "these insights have a number of phenomenological consequences  not only in magnetic dynamics but also in the fermi surface properties and in thermodynamics  which have been supported by the existing and emerging experiments .",
    "the insights will also help the search for the field theory that describes quantum critical heavy fermions .",
