    "already from the advent of quantum mechanics it was known that the structure of quantum theory is very different from the structure of the earlier existing classical theories .",
    "this structural difference has been expressed and studied in different mathematical categories , and we mention here some of the most important ones : ( 1 ) if one considers the collection of properties ( experimental propositions ) of a physical entity , then it has the structure of a boolean lattice for the case of a classical entity , while it is non - boolean for the case of a quantum entity ( birkhoff and von neumann 1936 , jauch 1968 , piron 1976 ) , ( 2 ) for the probability model , it can be shown that for a classical entity it is kolmogorovian , while for a quantum entity it is not ( foulis and randall 1972 , randall and foulis 1979 , 1983 , gudder 1988 , accardi 1982 , pitovski 1989 ) , ( 3 ) if the collection of observables is considered , a classical entity gives rise to a commutative algebra , while a quantum entity does nt ( segal 1947 , emch 1984 ) .",
    "the presence of these deep structural differences between classical theories and quantum theory has contributed strongly to the already earlier existing belief that classical theories describe the ordinary understandable part of reality , while quantum theory confronts us with a part of reality ( the micro - world ) that is impossible to understand . therefore still now there is the strong paradigm that _ quantum mechanics can not be understood_. the example of our macroscopic machine with a quantum structure challenges this paradigm , because obviously the functioning of this machine can be understood .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the main part of the quantum structures can indeed be explained in this way and the reason why they appear in nature can be identified . in this paper",
    "we shall analyze this explanation , that we have named the hidden measurement approach , in the category of the probability models .",
    "we refer to ( aerts and van bogaert 1992 , aerts , durt and van bogaert 1993 , aerts , durt , grib , van bogaert and zapatrin 1993 , aerts 1994 , aerts and durt 1994a ) for an analysis of this explanation in other categories .",
    "the original development of probability theory was aiming at a formalization of the description of a probability that appears as the consequence of _ a lack of knowledge_. the probability structure appearing in situations of lack of knowledge was axiomatized by kolmogorov and such a probability model is now called kolmogorovian . since the quantum probability model is not kolmogorovian ,",
    "it has now generally been accepted that the quantum probabilities are _ not _ a description of a _ lack of knowledge_. sometimes this conclusion is formulated by stating that the quantum probabilities are _ ontological _ probabilities , as if they would be present in reality itself . in the hidden measurement approach we show that the quantum probabilities can be explained as being due to a _ lack of knowledge _ , and we prove that what distinguishes quantum probabilities from classical kolmogorovian probabilities is the _ nature of this lack of knowledge_. let us go back to the quantum machine to illustrate what we mean .    if we consider again our quantum machine ( fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 ) , and look for the origin of the probabilities as they appear in this example , we can remark that the probability is entirely due to a _ lack of knowledge _ about the measurement process .",
    "namely the lack of knowledge of where exactly the elastic breaks during a measurement .",
    "more specifically , we can identify two main aspects of the experiment @xmath9 as it appears in the quantum machine .    1 .",
    "the experiment @xmath9 effects a real change on the state @xmath7 of the entity @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the state @xmath7 changes into one of the states @xmath34 or @xmath35 by the experiment @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   the probabilities appearing are due to a _ lack of knowledge _ about a deeper reality of the individual measurement process itself , namely where the elastic breaks .    these two effects give rise to quantum - like structures .",
    "the lack of knowledge about a deeper reality of the individual measurement process we have referred to as the presence of hidden measurements that operate deterministically in this deeper reality ( aerts 1986 , 1987 , 1991 ) , and that is the origin of the name that we gave to this approach .",
    "a consequence of this explanation is that quantum structures shall turn out to be present in many other regions of reality where the two mentioned effects appear .",
    "we think of the many situations in the human sciences , where generally the measurement disturbs profoundly the entity under study , and where almost always a lack of knowledge about the deeper reality of what is going on during this measurement process exists .",
    "in the final part of this paper we give some examples of quantum structures appearing in such situations .",
    "if the quantum structure can be explained by the presence of a lack of knowledge on the measurement process , we can go a step further , and wonder what types of structure arise when we consider the original models , with a lack of knowledge on the measurement process , and introduce a variation of the magnitude of this lack of knowledge .",
    "we have studied the quantum machine under varying lack of knowledge , parameterizing this variation by a number @xmath36 $ ] , such that @xmath37 corresponds to the situation of maximal lack of knowledge , giving rise to a quantum structure , and @xmath38 corresponds to the situation of zero lack of knowledge , generating a classical structure , and other values of @xmath0 correspond to intermediate situations , giving rise to a structure that is neither quantum nor classical ( aerts , durt and van bogaert 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "it is this model that we have called the @xmath0-model , and we want to introduce it again in this paper .",
    "we start from the quantum machine , but introduce now different types of elastic .",
    "an @xmath39-elastic consists of three different parts : one lower part where it is unbreakable , a middle part where it breaks uniformly , and an upper part where it is again unbreakable . by means of the two parameters",
    "@xmath36 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] , we fix the sizes of the three parts in the following way .",
    "suppose that we have installed the @xmath39-elastic between the points @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the sphere .",
    "then the elastic is unbreakable in the lower part from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , it breaks uniformly in the part from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , and it is again unbreakable in the upper part from @xmath45 to @xmath11 ( see fig .",

    "this means that we can apply theorem 4 , and conclude that the collection of conditional probabilities corresponding to these questions @xmath11 , @xmath6 and @xmath199 can neither be fitted into a kolmogorovian probability model nor into a quantum probability model .",
    "we are developing now in brussels a statistics for such new situations , that we have called interactive statistics. by means of this statistics it should be possible to make models for situations where part of the properties to be tested are created during the process of testing .",
    "the further development of an intermediate ( between classical and quantum ) probability theory and an interactive statistics could be very fruitful as well for physics as for other sciences .",
    "we work now at the construction of a general theory , where also the intermediate structures can be incoorporated ( aerts 1986 , aerts 1987 , aerts , durt and van bogaert 1993 , aerts 1994 , aerts and durt 1994a , 1994b , coecke 1994a , 1994b , 1994c ) .",
    "this theory can probably be used to describe the region of reality between microscopic and macroscopic , often referred to as the mesoscopic region .",
    "actually , physicists use a very complicated heuristic mixture of quantum and classical theories to construct models for mesoscopic entities .",
    "there is however no consistent theory , and a general intermediate theory could perhaps fill this gap .",
    "we try to find examples of simple physical phenomena in the mesoscopic region that could eventually be modeled by an @xmath0-like model ( aerts and durt 1994 b ) .",
    "if we succeed in building this intermediate theory , we would not only have a new theory for the mesoscopic region , but the existence of such a theory would also shed light on old problems of quantum mechanics ( the quantum classical relation , the classical limit , the measurement problem , etc ... ) . in    till now we have only been developing the kinematics of this intermediate theory ( aerts 1994 and aerts and durt 1994 a ) , but , once the kinematics is fully developed , the way to construct a dynamics for the intermediate region is straightforward",
    ". we can study the imprimitivity system related to the galilei group and look for representations of this galilei group in the group of automorphisms of the kinematical structure of the intermediate theory .",
    "if we can derive an evolution equation in this way , it should continuously transform with varying @xmath0 from the schrdinger equation ( @xmath37 ) , to the hamilton equations ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "as we have shown in the last section of this paper , the development of an interactive statistics could be of great importance for the human sciences , where often non - predetermined outcome situations appear .",
    "it could lead to a new methodology for these sciences .",
    "actually one is aware of the problem of the interaction between subject and object , but it is generally thought that this problems can not be taken into account in the theory",
    ".    we also want to remark that the hidden measurement approach defines a new quantization procedure . starting from a classical mechanical entity , and adding lack of knowledge ( or fluctuations) on the measurement process",
    ", out of the classical entity appears a quantum - like entity .",
    "another problem that we are investigating at this moment is an attempt to describe quantum chaos by means of this new quantization procedure .",
    "it can be shown that the sensitive dependence on the initial conditions that can be found in the @xmath0-model for the classical situation in the set of unstable equilibrium states disappears when the fluctuations on the measurement process increase .",

    "<S> we introduce a parameter @xmath0 that measures the size of the lack of knowledge on the measurement process , and by varying this parameter , we describe a continuous evolution from a quantum structure ( maximal lack of knowledge ) to a classical structure ( zero lack of knowledge ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for intermediate values of @xmath0 we find a new type of structure , that is neither quantum nor classical . </S>",
