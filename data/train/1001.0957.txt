    "it seems to be well - established that central to high-@xmath0 superconductivity ( htsc ) is the layered two - dimensional ( 2d ) structure of copper oxides and that superconducting pairing occurs mainly on the @xmath1 planes .",
    "however , the precise nature of the pairing is still the subject of intense research .",
    "recent experiments based on angle - resolved photon emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) of underdoped cuprates suggest that bound fermion cooper pairs ( cps ) form already at and below temperatures higher than the critical transition temperature @xmath0 tanaka06,valla06,millis06,yang08 .",
    "furthermore , arpes studies of the electron spectral function of optimally doped bi2212 samples show that the magnitude of the isotope effect correlates with the superconducting gap gweon04 , thus suggesting a role of lattice phonons in the superconducting pairing .",
    "arpes data also suggest that the energy gap @xmath6 ( a measure of the energy needed to break a cp ) displays an unconventional @xmath7 orbital pairing symmetry , with a functional dependence @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the angle between the total or center - of - mass momentum ( cmm ) @xmath10 of paired electrons in the @xmath1 plane and the @xmath11- ( or @xmath12- ) axis while @xmath13 is the value of the superconducting gap at the antinode ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "this behavior is also apparent in studies based on electronic raman scattering @xcite and in determinations of the in - plane magnetic penetration depth @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "although the majority viewpoint in the high-@xmath0 community seems to argue for such non - s - wave pairing symmetry there are compelling dissenting views , particularly work within the past few years , by mller @xcite , harshman @xcite , klemm @xcite , and many others .",
    "in particular , mller concludes that ... recent experiments probing the surface and bulk of cuprate superconductors [ show that their ] character is @xmath16 on the surface and substantially @xmath17 in the bulk .",
    "this conclusion has been bolstered by muon - spin relaxation ( @xmath18sr ) experiments with ybco reported and interpreted in ref.@xcite .",
    "several authors @xcite have proposed that the doping process could modify the electron - phonon interaction and the fermi surface with a concomitant shift from @xmath16- to @xmath17-type coupling as doping increases .",
    "the strongest evidence for an s - wave order parameter in a cuprate is reviewed in ref.@xcite where several @xmath19-axis twist experiments on bscco along with earlier @xmath19-axis tunneling between bscco / pb junctions are surveyed .",
    "ref.@xcite summarizes many of the problems with the so - called phase - sensitive  tests @xcite in ybco .",
    "additionally , predictions made in ref.@xcite that a vortex in a @xmath16-wave superconductor would exhibit a measurable density of states in a four - fold pattern emanating from the core have not been observed klemm09privcomm  in either ybco or bscco . on the contrary ,",
    "the vortex cores appear consistent @xcite with isotropic @xmath17-waves .    replacing the characteristic phonon - exchange debye temperature @xmath20 of around @xmath21 ( with @xmath22",
    "the boltzmann constant and @xmath23 the debye frequency ) by a characteristic _ magnon_-exchange temperature of around @xmath24 can lead to a simple model interaction such as the bcs one but associated with spin - fluctuation - mediated pairing @xcite .",
    "the so - called uemura plot  uemura04 of data from @xmath18sr , neutron and raman scattering , and arpes measurements exhibit @xmath0 _ vs _ fermi temperatures @xmath25 where @xmath26 the fermi energy and @xmath22 the boltzmann constant .",
    "empirical @xmath0s  of many cuprates straddle a straight line _ parallel _ to the uemura - plot line associated with the simple bec formula @xmath27 corresponding to an ideal gas of bosons of mass @xmath28 and number density @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the effective mass and @xmath31 the number density of individual charge carriers .",
    "the parallel line is shifted down from @xmath32  by a factor @xmath33-@xmath34 .",
    "this has been judged uemura06  as a fundamental importance of the bec concept in cuprates .",
    "previous theoretical papers on the possible origin of htsc fujita02,dellano98,fg , dellano07 proposed that the phenomenon might be rooted in a 2d bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of cps pre - existing above @xmath35 and coupled through a bcs - like phonon mechanism @xcite , originally taken as @xmath17-wave .",
    "as apparently first reported by schrieffer @xcite , the cooper model interaction @xcite leads to an approximate _ linear _ energy - vs - cmm relation @xmath36 for excited cps propagating in the fermi sea in 3d .",
    "this kind of dispersion relation is not unique to the cooper model interaction .",
    "for example , an attractive interfermion delta potential @xcite in 2d ( imagined regularized @xcite to support a single bound state of binding energy @xmath37 ) leads @xcite ( for a review see ref.dellano07 ) to the general cp dispersion relation @xmath38 \\hbar ^{2}k^{2}/4m^{\\ast } + o(k^{3})$ ] , where @xmath39 precisely as with the cooper model interaction @xcite .",
    "hence , the leading - order linearity is not induced by the particular interfermion interaction binding the cps but is a consequence of the fermi sea with @xmath40  and in which a cp by definition propagates . only in the vacuum limit @xmath41",
    "does that general dispersion relation reduce by inspection to the expected quadratic form @xmath42 for a composite object of mass @xmath43 . for either interelectron interaction model ,",
    "the linear term is a consequence of the presence of the fermi sea .",
    "the formation of a bec of cps in 2d does not violate hohenberg s theorem @xcite as this holds only for quadratically - dispersive particles .",
    "the predicted 2d bec temperature is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the cp number per unit area .",
    "this leads to values of @xmath0 that are too high compared with empirical values .",
    "however , these schemes provide a correct description of other relevant physical properties of htscs such as a short coherence length , a type ii magnetic behavior , and the temperature dependence of the electronic heat capacity @xcite .",
    "they also lead to excellent fits of the condensate fraction curves for quasi-2d cuprates just below @xmath0 @xcite , as well as for 3d and even quasi-1d scs . to go beyond the simple @xmath17-wave interaction , an @xmath46-wave formulation of bcs theory",
    "was discussed by schrieffer @xcite himself and studied in considerable detail by anderson and morel @xcite in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "this has been successfully employed hirschfeld93,maki94 to describe thermodynamic and transport properties of high-@xmath0 cuprates .",

    "the pauli principle prevents background fermions in electron states just below ( above ) the fermi surface from participating in the interaction . in the absence of external forces",
    "each pair propagates freely within a layer of finite width @xmath52 along the @xmath53 direction and infinite extent on the @xmath54 plane so that its total momentum @xmath55 is a constant of motion . by neglecting spin - dependent interactions",
    "the total spin @xmath56 is conserved too and for a spin singlet @xmath57 configuration the pauli principle requires that the orbital wavefunction be of the form @xmath58 , where the relative coordinate @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the horizontal projection of the cm coordinate @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 integer ) .",
    "the @xmath53-dependence of the wavefunction ensures that the vertical flux of the electron ( hole ) pair across the layer boundary is null .",
    "since the relative - coordinate problem is isotropic then @xmath64 is an eigenfunction of angular momentum with quantum numbers @xmath65 .",
    "the total spin @xmath57 singlet eigenstates of the system satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath66where @xmath67 is the free hamiltonian @xmath49 the interaction potential and @xmath68 the energy eigenvalue . for a given cmm wavevector @xmath69",
    ", we may expand the wave function as@xmath70 in momentum space ( [ sch ] )  thus becomes @xmath71with @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
