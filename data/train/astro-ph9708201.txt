    "cygnus x3 is a unique and poorly understood x - ray source which may represent a very short - lived , transitional state of binary evolution .",
    "a study of its dynamics ( via the orbital ephemeris ) , and local environment ( via the light curve and spectrum ) may have broad implications for x - ray binaries in general .",
    "the period ( 4.8 hr , presumably orbital ) is characteristic of low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "however , there is evidence that the companion is actually a high - mass wolf - rayet star @xcite . the mass loss from the stellar wind of such a star could explain the large _ positive _ @xmath1 measured in cyg x3 , which is inconsistent with mass transfer via roche lobe overflow @xcite .",
    "the light curve , observed in ir and x - rays , is asymmetric with a non - zero eclipse , resulting , in most models , from interactions in a dense cocoon or wind around the system @xcite .",
    "if the asymmetry is instead caused by an elliptical orbit , the light curve shape is expected to change significantly over time due to apsidal motion @xcite which could also produce some or all of the apparent period increase @xcite .",
    "therefore , measurements of the light curve shape are directly related to the orbital dynamics .",
    "osse @xcite observed cyg x-3 for @xmath2 days in 7 intervals between 1991 may 30 and 1994 july 12 .",
    "we use the 2-min background - subtracted @xmath3  to 10  spectra produced by the standard osse spectral analysis routines for these 7 observations .",
    "there was no significant flux contribution from cyg x1 in any of the source or background pointings .",
    "some results of the earlier osse observations have been described elsewhere @xcite .    for the asm we used the background subtracted 210  cyg x-3 counting rates from the quick - look results provided by the asm / rxte team over the www .",
    "the data analyzed here cover 1996 feb 22  1997 apr 11 .",
    ".asm arrival times [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the asm arrival times were combined with those from earlier soft x - ray observations and fit with both quadratic and cubic ephemeris models ( figure [ res_plot ] ) .",
    "the resulting best - fit parameters are shown in table [ ephem ] .",
    "neither quadratic nor cubic models provide a statistically acceptable fit to all the data .",
    "possibly the errors in earlier data have been underestimated due to cycle - to - cycle variations or other systematic effects @xcite .",
    "no single data set drives the bad @xmath4 .",
    "the cubic term is still statistically significant , but the fitted magnitude has decreased with time : from @xmath5 @xcite to @xmath6 yr@xmath7 in this work .",
    "the wind model predicts essentially zero @xmath8 .",
    "future asm data should provide a definitive test of the reality of the non - zero @xmath8 .",
    "following the same procedure used for the asm data , arrival times were determined for the each of the 7 osse observations of cyg x3 from 1991 to 1994 using light curves of 2-min background - subtracted counting rates @xmath0130 .",
    "the arrival times for the 7 observations were compared with the values predicted using the soft x - ray ephemerides ( table [ ephem ] ) .",
    "the osse points fall systematically below the predicted curves on the residual plot .",
    "the osse phase minimum ( @xmath0130 ) is significantly ( 67@xmath9 ) earlier than the predicted soft x - ray ( 110 ) minimum for both quadratic and cubic ephemerides ( @xmath10 min , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the data are consistent with a constant offset over more than 3 years of observations .",
    "light curves ( figure [ lc ] ) were produced from the asm and osse data using the quadratic ephemeris in table [ ephem ] .",
    "the plotted errors in the asm data reflect only the reported statistical errors .",
    "the light curves were fit with the exosat soft x - ray template @xcite , varying phase , amplitude , and dc intensity to determine the phase of minimum and the consistency of the overall shape with the template .",
    "both the osse and asm light curves are statistically _ inconsistent _ with the canonical x - ray template @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , however , the template reasonably describes the asm data .",
    "the large @xmath12 is due to the fact that the actual observed variations in each bin are larger that the statistical errors due to underlying source fluctuations .",
    "the osse lc appears somewhat more symmetric than the template , with a faster rise , but this is difficult to constrain with current data .",
    "the differences in lc shape may contribute to the apparent phase shift with energy .",
