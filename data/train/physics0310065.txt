    "theoretical descriptions of photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs ) have traditionally been restricted to numerical evaluation of maxwell s equations . in the most general case , a plane wave expansion method with periodic boundary conditions",
    "is employed  @xcite while other methods , such as the multipole method @xcite , take advantage of the localized nature of the guided modes and to some extend the circular shape of the air - holes .",
    "the reason for the application of these methods is the relatively complex dielectric cross section of a pcf for which rotational symmetry is absent .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide a set of numerically based empirical expressions describing the basic properties such as cutoff and mode - field radius of a pcf based on the fundamental geometrical parameters only .",
    "we consider the fiber structure first studied by knight _",
    "_ @xcite and restrict our study to fibers that consist of pure silica with a refractive index of 1.444 .",
    "the air holes of diameter @xmath1 are arranged on a triangular grid with a pitch , @xmath2 . in the center",
    "an air hole is omitted creating a central high index defect serving as the fiber core .",
    "a schematic drawing of such a structure is shown in the inset of the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    depending on the dimensions , the structure comprises both single- and multi - mode fibers with large mode area as well as nonlinear fibers .",
    "the results presented here cover relative air hole sizes , @xmath3 , from 0.2 to 0.9 and normalized wavelengths , @xmath4 , from around 0.05 to 2 .",
    "the modeling is based on the plane - wave expansion method with periodic boundary conditions  @xcite . for the calculations of guided modes presented the size of the super cell was @xmath5 resolved by @xmath6 plane waves while for calculations on the cladding structure only , the super cell was reduced to a simple cell resolved by @xmath7 planes waves .",
    "when attempting to establish a simple formalism for the pcf it is natural to strive for a result similar to the @xmath0parameter known from standard fibers @xcite . however , a simple translation is not straight forward since no wavelength - independent core- or cladding index can be defined .",
    "recently , we instead proposed a formulation of the @xmath0parameter for a pcf given by  @xcite    @xmath8    although this expression has the same overall mathematical form as known from standard fibers , the unique nature of the pcf is taken into account . in eq .",
    "( [ vpcf ] ) , @xmath9 is the wavelength dependent effective index of the fundamental mode ( fm ) and @xmath10 is the corresponding effective index of the first cladding mode in the infinite periodic cladding structure often denoted the fundamental space filling mode ( fsm ) . for a more detailed discussion of this expression and its relation to previous work",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "we have recently argued that the higher - order mode cut - off can be associated with a value of @xmath11 @xcite and showed that this criterion is indeed identical to the single - mode boundary calculated from the multipole method @xcite .",
    "recently the cut off results have also been confirmed experimentally @xcite . further supporting the definition of @xmath12 is the recent observation @xcite that the relative equivalent mode field radius of the fundamental mode , @xmath13 as function of @xmath12 fold over a single curve independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the mode field radius @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 and corresponds to the @xmath16 width of a gaussian intensity distribution with the same effective area , @xmath17 , as the fundamental mode itself @xcite .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , calculated curves of @xmath12 as function of @xmath18 are shown for @xmath3 ranging from 0.20 to 0.70 in steps of 0.05 . in general , all curves are seen to approach constant levels dependent on @xmath3 .",
    "the horizontal dashed line indicates the single - mode boundary @xmath11 . in the right panel",
    ", @xmath13 is plotted as function of @xmath12 for each of the 9 curves in the left panel and as seen all curves fold over a single curve . an empirical expression for @xmath13 can be found in ref .",
    "the mode is seen to expand rapidly for small values of @xmath12 and the mode - field radius saturates toward a constant value when @xmath12 becomes large .",
    "in fact , it turns out that @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath11 . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , curves corresponding to constant values of @xmath12 are shown in a @xmath4 versus @xmath3 plot . in the right panel ,",
    "curves of constant @xmath13 is shown , also in a @xmath4 versus @xmath3 plot .",
    "since there is a unique relation between @xmath13 and @xmath12 @xcite the curves naturally have the same shape .    when designing a pcf any combination of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is in principle possible .",
    "however , in some cases the guiding will be weak causing the mode to expand beyond the core and into the cladding region  @xcite corresponding to a low value of @xmath12 . in the other extreme",
    ", the confinement will be too strong allowing for the guiding of higher - order modes @xcite .",
    "since both situations are governed by @xmath12 the design relevant region in a @xmath4 versus @xmath3 plot can be defined .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where the low limit is chosen to be @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "how large a mode that can be tolerated is of course not unambiguous .",
    "however , for @xmath24 leakage - loss typically becomes a potential problem in pcfs with a finite cladding structure . in non - linear pcfs",
    "it is for dispersion reasons often advantageous operating the pcf at @xmath25 and then a high number of air - hole rings is needed to achieve an acceptable level of leakage loss @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the practical operational regime is also limited from the low wavelength side . in ref .",
    "@xcite a low - loss criterion was formulated in terms of the coupling length @xmath26 $ ] between the fm and the fsm . in general scattering - loss due to longitudinal non - uniformities increases",
    "when @xmath27 increases and a pcf with a low @xmath27 will in general be more stable compared to one with a larger @xmath27 . using @xmath28 we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ vpcf ] ) as    @xmath29    from which it is seen that a high value of the @xmath0parameter is preferred over a smaller value . in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) it is thus preferable to stay close to the single - mode boundary ( @xmath30 ) but in general there is a practical lower limit to the value of @xmath4 which can be realized because when @xmath31 one generally has that @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath0parameter offers a simple way to design a pcf , a limiting factor for using eq .",
    "( [ vpcf ] ) is that a numerical method is still required for obtaining the effective indices . in analogy with expressions for standard fibers",
    "@xcite it would therefore be convenient to have an alternative expression only dependent on the wavelength , @xmath33 , and the structural parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show @xmath12 as function of @xmath4 ( data are shown by open circles ) for @xmath3 ranging from 0.20 to 0.80 in steps of 0.05 . each data set in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is fitted to a function of the form    [ vpcf_fit ] @xmath34 + 1}\\ ] ] and the result is indicated by the full red lines .",
    "( [ vpcf_fit_v ] ) is not based on considerations of the physics of the v - parameter but merely obtained by trial and error in order to obtain the best representation of calculated data with the lowest possible number of free parameters .",
    "prior to the fit , the data sets are truncated at @xmath35 since @xmath36 in this region ( see left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and the data is thus not practically relevant . in eq .",
    "( [ vpcf_fit_v ] ) the fitting parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 depend on @xmath3 only . in order to extract this dependency , suitable functions ( again obtained by trial and error )",
    "are fitted to the data sets for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "we find that the data are well described by the following expressions    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    the above set of expressions , eqs .",
    "( [ vpcf_fit ] ) , constitute our empirical expression for the @xmath0parameter in a pcf with @xmath4 and @xmath3 being the only input parameters . for @xmath43 and @xmath44 the expression gives values of @xmath12 which deviates less than @xmath45 from the correct values obtained from eq .",
    "( [ vpcf ] ) .",
    "the term endlessly single - mode ( esm ) refers to pcfs which regardless of wavelength only support the two degenerate polarization states of the fundamental mode @xcite . in the framework of the @xmath0parameter this corresponds to structures for which @xmath46 for any @xmath4 @xcite . as seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] this corresponds to sufficiently small air holes .",
    "however , from the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it is quite difficult to determine the exact @xmath3 value for which @xmath11 for @xmath33 approaching 0 . from eq .",
    "( [ vpcf_fit ] ) it is easily seen that the value may be obtained from    @xmath47    fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] illustrates this equation graphically where we have extrapolated the data in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] to @xmath48 . from the intersection of the full line with the dashed line we find that @xmath49 bounds the esm regime .",
    "solving eq .",
    "( [ d_esm ] ) we get @xmath50 and the deviation from the numerically obtained value is within the accuracy of the empirical expression .",
    "there are several issues to consider when designing a pcf . in this work",
    "we have addressed the single / multi - mode issue as well as those related to mode - field radius / field - confinement , and mode - spacing .",
    "we have shown how these properties can be quantified via the @xmath0parameter .",
    "based on extensive numerics we have established an empirical expression which facilitate an easy evaluation of the @xmath0-parameter with the normalized wavelength and hole - size as the only input parameters .",
    "we believe that this expression provides a major step away from the need of heavy numerical computations in design of solid core pcfs with triangular air - hole cladding .",
