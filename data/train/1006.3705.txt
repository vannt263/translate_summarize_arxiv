    "the problem of solitary - wave solutions of the one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation has been studied extensively , starting with the work of zakharov and shabat @xcite and of tsuzuki @xcite .",
    "in addition , lieb @xcite has examined the problem of a bose gas in strictly one dimension with periodic boundary conditions and a repulsive interaction , and he derived the excitation spectrum .",
    "as demonstrated in that study , the spectrum consists of the usual bogoliubov branch as well as a second branch .",
    "this branch was later identified as corresponding to solitary - wave excitation @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensed atoms interacting via a contact potential are described by a nonlinear schrdinger equation and thus offer a very suitable system for the study of solitary waves @xcite .",
    "solitary waves have been created in quasi - one - dimensional traps with a very weak harmonic potential in the long direction @xcite and in pancake traps @xcite .",
    "recently , it also became possible to confine atoms in toroidal traps @xcite in which persistent currents were observed @xcite .",
    "based on this experimental progress , it is natural to consider the possible creation of solitary waves in such toroidal traps .",
    "this is the subject of the present study . in the following ,",
    "we examine the properties of solitary waves , including their density , propagation velocity , and phase ( and thus the superfluid velocity ) , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we note that carr _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite have previously considered the special case of _ static _ periodic solitary - wave solutions for a fixed particle number and a length .    for simplicity",
    "we consider in the present study a very tight toroidal trap , neglecting the transverse degrees of freedom , and thus consider the purely one - dimensional motion of atoms on a ring .",
    "the main question to be considered here is the behavior of solitonic solutions as the length of the period @xmath0 is varied for fixed @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of particles .",
    "the relevant dimensionless parameter is the ratio of @xmath0 and the coherence length , @xmath3 , which we choose as that corresponding to the maximum density . according to the value of @xmath4 we distinguish between  large \" rings , where @xmath5 , and  small \" rings , where @xmath6 . in lieb",
    "s study @xcite , the limit @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath1 finite was considered .",
    "this corresponds to the limit of large rings in the present study .",
    "we note that the ratio @xmath9 also describes the ratio between the typical zero - point energy , @xmath10 , and the typical interaction energy , @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we restrict ourselves to the case of repulsive effective interatomic interactions .    as we will show below , in the limit of large rings , the wave is localized within a length scale determined by the coherence length , and the density is constant over the rest of the system , in agreement with known results for an infinite system . on the other hand , depending on the phase difference at the edges of the system ( which is either zero or some integer multiple of @xmath12 ) ,",
    "two different situations can arise . for zero phase difference ,",
    "the minimum possible value of the density is zero , and the velocity of propagation varies between a lowest nonzero value , which scales as @xmath13 and essentially corresponds to the superfluid  drift \" velocity , and a maximum velocity which is set by the speed of sound . in the case of a nonzero phase difference , the velocity of propagation can be zero , but the corresponding density can not vanish , scaling like @xmath9 . clearly , when @xmath7 and @xmath14 with @xmath1 finite , we find agreement with known results .    in the opposite limit of small rings ,",
    "the density becomes sinusoidal with a length scale given by @xmath0 itself .",
    "furthermore , the velocity of propagation saturates to a constant value , which scales like @xmath15 , and the minimum density can become zero .    in what follows we first formulate our problem in sec.ii . then , in sec.iii we give the general solution .",
    "section iv examines certain limiting cases , starting from the linearization of the problem and then turning to the limits of large and small rings . in sec.v",
    "we present a general result for the minimum value of the velocity of propagation of the wave , and finally we summarize our results and present our conclusions in sec.vi .",
    "assume that we have a ring of circumference @xmath0 which contains @xmath2 atoms of mass @xmath16 . within the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the order parameter @xmath17 satisfies the equation ( in the range @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , because of the repulsive interatomic interactions that we consider . assuming that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the chemical potential and @xmath24 , @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the velocity of propagation of the assumed traveling - wave solution . setting @xmath27 , the superfluid velocity @xmath28 is given by the continuity equation @xmath29 there is also an euler equation for the density , @xmath30 ^ 2 + \\mu n + \\frac { \\hbar^6 c_1 ^ 2 }   { 8 m^3 n } - \\frac { u_0 } 2 n^2 + \\frac m 2 u^2 n = c_2 , \\label{euler}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constants of integration .",
    "the desired solution has a vanishing derivative at the points @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",

    ", it is convenient to pick a value of @xmath53 and @xmath62 , and determine @xmath74 from eq.([ellint ] ) .",
    "it is clear from its definition that @xmath74 must be greater than or equal to zero for physically meaningful solutions .",
    "the value of @xmath62 can then be adjusted to satisfy the normalization condition on @xmath72 .",
    "equations ( [ solution ] ) , ( [ ellint ] ) , and ( [ velprof ] ) are consistent with bloch s theorem @xcite . because of",
    "the periodic boundary conditions imposed , the order parameter @xmath75 of the solitary wave corresponding to the branch with quantum number @xmath67 is given by that obtained for @xmath71 by exciting the center of mass motion , @xmath76 .",
    "these two solutions have the same density , but there is a difference in the velocity of propagation so that @xmath77/c = 2 \\sqrt 2 \\pi q \\xi / l$ ] , in agreement with eq.([velprof ] ) .",
    "similarly , the energy spectrum consists of a periodic part plus an envelope function which results from the energy of the center of mass motion .",
    "when @xmath78 , one can obtain equations for the force and for continuity by linearizing the problem in small deviations of the density and the phase from the homogeneous solution @xmath79 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 . when the two are combined , we obtain @xmath83 thus , @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 constants .",

    "these results agree with those of carr _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in that study only static solitary waves were considered , and ( as mentioned in ref.@xcite ) this is not possible for zero phase difference .",
    "their choice of @xmath142 leads to @xmath143 according to eq.([vellargeegenqm ] ) , which is in good agreement with the numerical results of fig.4 of this reference .",
    "it should also be noted that eq.([vellargeegenqm ] ) is valid for a single solitary - wave solution .",
    "for a two - solitary wave solution it is possible for them to be both static and dark ( i.e. , to have a node in the density ) .",

    "in other words , in the limit of small rings , the sinusoidal dependence of the density always gives rise to a phase difference of @xmath133 for any value of the ratio @xmath165 .",
    "since the periodic boundary conditions require that the total phase difference has to be @xmath166 , the additional phase accumulation must be @xmath167 .",
    "this fact gives a slope to the phase that is @xmath168 ( plus corrections of order @xmath150 , and therefore @xmath169 , in agreement with eq.([velsmalll ] ) .",

    "to summarize , solitary - wave solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation framework show interesting features if one imposes the periodic boundary conditions appropriate for the description of bose - einstein condensed atoms confined in tight toroidal traps .    in the limit of large rings , where the size of the wave is much smaller than the length of the ring",

    ". however , both can not be zero simultaneously .    in the limit of small rings ,",
    "the density is sinusoidal within a length scale given by the circumference of the ring itself .",
    "the velocity of propagation saturates to a constant value , which is independent of @xmath74 . for this reason",
