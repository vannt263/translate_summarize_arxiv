    "jan oort proposed @xcite and measured @xcite the now called oort constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 , over seven decades ago by assuming that stars in the galaxy moved on circular orbits . later on his analysis was generalized to the non - axisymmetric case ( e.g. , @xcite ) resulting in the definition of two more constants : @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the importance of the oort constants ( oc ) is in their simple relation ( at least in the case of vanishing random motions ) to the galactic potential .",
    "many investigations have been conducted in the attempt to measure the oc .",
    "however , not all the results are in agreement ( for a review see @xcite ) , which is mainly due to the absence of a complete proper motions catalog .",
    "recent studies have failed to improve measurements of the oc .",
    "another reason for the diversity among the values derived for the oc has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "the authors present an effect which arises from the longitudinal variations of the mean stellar parallax caused by intrinsic density inhomogeneities . together with the reflex of the solar motion these variations create contributions to the longitudinal proper motions which are indistinguishable from the oc at @xmath5 20% of their amplitude .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter o&d ) measured the oc using proper motions from act / tycho-2 catalog and corrected for the  mode mixing \" effect described above , using the latitudinal proper motions .",
    "they found that the oc vary approximately linearly with asymmetric drift ( or age ) from the young - stars values to those appropriate for old populations .",
    "this trend may result from perturbations induced by the galactic bar or spiral structure . in this paper",
    "we investigate the latter possibility .",
    "deviations from the axisymmetric values of the oc have not received a satisfactory interpretation although they are often assumed to arise from a non - axisymmetric galactic potential perturbation such as spiral structure or / and the galactic bar .",
    "given their preeminent importance , we feel that a better understanding of the effect of spiral perturbation on the measurements of the oc is necessary .",
    "spiral arms perturb the local velocity field corrupting local measurements of the oc .",
    "thus we look for the effect of spiral structure on the oc @xmath6 and @xmath3 and their deviation from the axisymmetric limit .",
    "we hope that this would give us some constraints on the spiral structure .",

    "there are two values of @xmath49 for which this frequency is the same as the epicyclic frequency and this is where the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) and the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) are located .",

    "corotation of each spiral pattern occurs at @xmath61 .      to investigate the effect of a spiral density wave on the local velocity field we need to simulate a large number of stars . in this paper",
    "we consider an initially cold or hot stellar disks as described in ",

    "this way of creating additional particles is justified by the fact that a steady state ( constant pitch angle and angular velocity ) spiral density wave does not change the kinematics of stars once it has been grown . as was demonstrated by @xcite test particles",

    "the density distribution is exponential , @xmath69 , with a scale length @xmath70 , consistent with the 2mass photometry study by @xcite .",
    "we would like to see how spiral structure changes the velocity field in the case of an initially cold or initially hot stellar disk . to simulate the cold disk we send stars on circular orbits with the same initial azimuthal velocity @xmath71 consistent with a flat rotation curve .",
    "for the hot disk we give an initial radial velocity dispersion in the form of a gaussian distribution .",

    "in fact , they may vary with the position in the galaxy @xmath107 .",
    "the reason for variations of the oc with galactic radius , if we assumed the galaxy were axisymmetric , is the fact that the number density and velocity dispersions are functions of @xmath49 . in the case of a non - axisymmetric galaxy , due to spiral arms , bar , etc . , we would expect a variation with @xmath44 as well .",

    "before we look at the non - axisymmetric case we wish to examine the effect of an initially hot stellar disc on the measurement of the oc .",
    "as described above we use a background axisymmetric potential consistent with a flat rotation curve . if stars moved on circular orbits and we assumed a solar radius of @xmath124 kpc and a circular velocity of 220 km / s we would measure @xmath125 km / s / kpc and @xmath126 .",

    "radial oscillations cause stars with home radii interior and exterior to @xmath9 to be observed at the lsr .",
    "because the surface density and radial velocity dispersion are exponentially decreasing functions of radius , on average , these stars have a lower azimuthal velocity than those with guiding radius of @xmath9 .",
    "this causes a tail in the distribution of @xmath21 weighted toward negative values and is quantified by the asymmetric drift , defined as the difference between the lsr and the mean rotation velocity : @xmath135 @xcite . obviously ,",

    "the asymmetric drift inferred from @xmath136 , given a radial velocity dispersion @xmath74 km / s , is 20 km / s @xmath145 . even though this is marginally consistent with our numerically calculated value @xmath146 km / s , here consistency is not to be expected since the constant @xmath48 was determined empirically for the sn and thus may reflect non - axisymmetric effects or incomplete mixing .",
    "[ eq : oc ] were derived only to first order in the taylor expansion of the velocities .",
    "higher order terms might become important for deep samples . in our simulations",
    "we calculate the oc from a sample of test particles centered at @xmath147 pc from the lsr and an annulus width of 200 pc .",
    "since our expressions for the oc are only valid in the limit of @xmath148 , we need to evaluate the oc in several distance bins and extrapolate to @xmath149 .",
    "we performed such an extrapolation for the hot axisymmetric disk discussed above and found that in the range @xmath150 kpc the variation in @xmath0 and @xmath1 was less than @xmath151 km / s / kpc .",
    "however , when spiral structure is included , the variations with sample depth could be significant , especially for the cold disk case . ",
    "[ sec : sample_depth ] is devoted to this problem .    the errors in @xmath0 and @xmath1 induced by the axisymmetric drift in the hot disk need to be kept in mind when considering the hot population simulations with included spiral structure perturbation , presented in the next section .",

    "<S> we show that systematic errors due to the presence of spiral structure are likely to affect the measurements of the oort constants . </S>",
    "<S> moderate strength spiral structure causes errors of order 5 km / s / kpc in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find variations of the fourier coefficients with velocity dispersion , pattern speed , and sample depth . for a sample at an average heliocentric distance of 0.8 kpc we can summarize our findings as follows : ( i ) if our location in the galaxy is near corotation then we expect a vanishing value for @xmath2 for all phase angles ; ( ii ) for a hot disk , spiral structure induced errors for all oort constants vanish at , and just inward of the corotation radius ; ( iii ) as one approaches the 4:1 lindblad resonances @xmath4 increases and so does its variation with galactic azimuth ; ( iv ) for all simulations @xmath4 , on average , is larger for lower stellar velocity dispersions , contrary to recent measurements . </S>"
