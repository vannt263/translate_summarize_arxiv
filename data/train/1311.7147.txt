    "radio emission from jetted extragalactic sources associated with agn is produced in two main distinct locations , i.e. , the relativistic jet and the at most mildly relativistic radio lobes ( including the hot spots ) , where jet material impacts on to the intergalactic and intracluster media , and its mechanical power is partly dissipated in a shock ( e.g. begelman et al .",
    "1984 , de young 2002 ) .",
    "radiation is strongly enhanced at viewing angles close to the jet axis by relativistic beaming , and it becomes very faint , until undetectable , for large viewing angles . on the contrary ,",
    "the slower expanding extended lobes emit almost isotropically .",
    "the lobes are usually detected in the radio band thanks to their optically thin synchrotron emission , which is characterized by a relatively steep energy spectral index , @xmath40.7 [ @xmath5 . the radio jet emission , instead , is modelled as the superposition of several ( partially ) self  absorbed synchrotron components , produced by more compact structures , giving rise to a flatter radio spectrum ( @xmath60.7 ) .",
    "the idea of unification of all radio  sources on the basis of our viewing angle dates back to blandford & rees ( 1978 ; see urry & padovani 1995 for a review ) .",
    "when our line of sight lies within an angle @xmath7 to the jet axis , where @xmath8 is the jet bulk lorentz factor , the beamed , flat radio flux dominates , and the source is classified as a blazar . for larger viewing angles isotropic emission from the extended regions takes over , and we do observe a steep spectrum radio source .",
    "the  @xmath9 \" beaming angle provides an approximated but convenient way to relate the number density of the observed blazars to that of the underlying parent population",
    ". indeed , as discussed in volonteri et al .",
    "( 2011 ; see also ghisellini et al .",
    "2013 ) , for each observed blazar there must exist a number @xmath10 of sources intrinsically similar , but pointing away from us .",
    "the spectrum of such population should be steep in the radio band , while at larger frequencies isotropic components ( e.g. , emission lines , accretion disk , host galaxy ) , usually  but not always  masked in blazars by the relativistically boosted jet emission , dominate .",
    "blazars are easily detectable up to high redshifts .",
    "although relatively rare , their large fluxes in almost all electromagnetic bands make them detected in large area flux limited surveys .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is characterized by two broad humps , usually interpreted as the synchrotron and the inverse compton emissions from a single distribution of highly relativistic electrons ( sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) . at increasing bolometric luminosities",
    ", the peak of the two humps shift to lower frequencies , and the high energy hump becomes comparatively stronger ( fossati et al . 1998 ; donato et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this phenomenology suggests that hard x  ray and @xmath11ray surveys are particularly efficient in finding powerful blazars at high redshifts .",
    "indeed , such expectations are confirmed by the all sky surveys carried out by the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard _ swift _ ( detecting blazars up to @xmath12 , see ajello et al .",
    "2009 ) , and by the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard _ fermi _ ( detecting blazars up to @xmath13 , see e.g. nolan et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in this work we will consider the subclass of powerful radio  sources , classified as fr ii radio galaxies ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) and steep spectrum radio  loud quasars , where the relativistic jet is misaligned , and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , whose jet points at us .",
    "these agns are the most powerful persistent sources we know of , their jets carrying a power , in magnetic fields and particles , that can exceed @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 ( celotti & ghisellini 2008 ; ghisellini 2010 ; fernandes et al .",
    "estimates of the energy associated to large scale extended structures yield to at least @xmath16@xmath17 erg , shared amongst relativistic emitting electrons , magnetic fields , and possibly protons of still unknown temperature ( e.g. blundell & rawlings 2000 ; croston et al . 2005 ; belsole et al . 2007 ; godfrey & shabala 2013 ) .    in powerful blazars , the synchrotron hump peaks at sub  mm frequencies , with a steep spectrum above .",
    "the rapidly declining non  thermal emission ( @xmath18 ) allows us to detect the accretion disc component .",
    "fits with a standard shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) disc emission model ( calderone et al .",
    "2013 ; castignani et al .",
    "2013 ) imply for all powerful blazars at @xmath19 in the bat and lat catalogs , black hole masses in excess of @xmath20 ( ghisellini et al . 2010a ; 2011 ) . this fact boosted interest in the search of powerful blazars at high@xmath0 , as an efficient way to count supermassive black holes at early epochs .",
    "in this context , blazars counts can be competitive with ( mainly optical ) searches for mostly radio  quiet quasars ( i.e. the sloan digital sky survey , sdss ; york et al",
    ". 2000 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , for each detected blazar , there must exist other @xmath21 misaligned sources with similar properties , including @xmath22 .",
    "typical values of @xmath8 are between 10 and 15 , so the very presence of a single blazar with a black hole mass @xmath23 already implies the existence of other @xmath24 sources with similar masses .",
    "should such sources have extended structures similar to those seen at lower redshifts , they could be easily detected  even at @xmath25  in radio surveys like the first ( faint images of the radio sky at 20 cm ; white et al .",
    "1997 ) , characterized by a flux limit of 1 mjy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "instead these sources appear to be at best under  represented in the combined sdss+first survey ( see volonteri et al .",
    "the chain of arguments leading to the claimed deficit was the following : first , we established that all bat blazars with @xmath19 and an x  ray luminosity ( in the 1555 kev band ) @xmath26 erg s@xmath15 have @xmath27 .",
    "then , we exploited the luminosity function of ajello et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to find out the expected density of blazars of high @xmath28 ( @xmath29 erg s@xmath15 , presumably hosting a black hole with @xmath30 ) in different redshift bins .",
    "to be conservative , we modified the ajello et al .",
    "( 2009 ) luminosity function above @xmath31 , introducing an exponential cut  off at larger redshifts .",
    "adopting @xmath32 as an average value ( estimated by fitting the sed of all the bat blazars with @xmath19 , ghisellini et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ) , we then computed the overall density of powerful radio  loud agns hosting a @xmath33 black hole , in different redshifts bins .",
    "finally we compared this expected number density with the detections in the sdss+first survey , finding agreement at @xmath34 , and a deficit of at least a factor of @xmath35 above .",
    "recently we showed that the source b2 1023 + 25 at @xmath36 is a blazar ( sbarrato et al . 2012 ; 2013 ) .",
    "this object , present in the sdss+first survey , was studied by shen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and is one of the only 4 sources detected in radio above @xmath37 in the shen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) catalog . for b2 1023 + 25",
    "we estimated @xmath38 , and a bulk lorentz factor @xmath39 .",
    "if its viewing angle is indeed @xmath40 , we expect other @xmath41340@xmath42 radio  sources in the sdss+first survey , while there are only 3 .",
    "given the importance of verifying the true number density of massive black holes in the early universe , we are urged to explain such a discrepancy .",
    "volonteri et al .",
    "( 2011 ) discussed this issue , suggesting three possible causes : i ) the radio lobes become for some ( yet unknown ) reason weaker than expected at @xmath43 , falling below the first detection threshold ; ii ) the average @xmath8 is typically(again for unknown reasons ) smaller than 1015 at high redshifts , so that the factor @xmath44 is much smaller than assumed ; iii ) powerful misaligned radio sources at high redshifts do not enter the sdss survey because of heavy obscuration in the optical , so that they lie below its detection threshold ; iv ) missing identifications of extended radio structures associated to lobes of an agn .    whatever the reason is , we face the intriguing fact that  something \" must change for sources at @xmath453 . this led us to assess the effects of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) on the radio properties of the extended structures of powerful sources , and here we present our findings .",
    "the idea of the cmb affecting the behaviour of radio loud agn dates back to the works by felten & rees ( 1967 ) and rees & setti ( 1968 ) , and it was followed by krolik & chen ( 1991 ) to explain the prevalence of sources with steep radio spectra at high redshifts .",
    "later celotti & fabian ( 2004 ) demonstrated that the extended structures of high@xmath0 powerful radio sources could contribute significantly to the diffuse x  ray background , via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering between radio emitting electrons and cmb photons , while more recently mocz , fabian & blundell ( 2011 ) studied the evolution of the extended structure of a radio source calculating synchrotron and adiabatic losses , as well as ic losses on cmb photons , whose radiation energy density is larger at larger redshifts .    here , we concentrate on the synchrotron emission from those relativistic electrons cooling mainly by scattering off cmb seed photons . since the energy density of the cmb scales as @xmath46",
    ", it may become larger than the typical magnetic energy density in radio lobes , enhancing the total radiative losses , and hence modifying the electron distribution function , especially at the largest energies .",
    "we will compute in detail how the cmb modifies the electron distribution in jets , hot spots and extended lobes , and how the radio emission from powerful radio  loud agns changes with redshift , allowing us to compare our results with observations .    in this work",
    ", we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath47 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 and @xmath48 .",
    "at all redshifts , the extended structure of a radio source is due to the energy deposited by the jet once it impacts onto the intergalactic medium . today",
    ", powerful radio  sources can easily reach @xmath411 mpc away from the central engine .",
    "these radio sources are often associated with poor clusters or groups , and 1 mpc is larger than the core radius @xmath49 mpc of a typical cluster , where the density is estimated to be about @xmath50 @xmath51 ( e.g. sarazin 2008 ) . out of the core radius",
    "the gas density approximatively follows an isothermal profile , @xmath52 $ ] , resulting in @xmath53 @xmath51 at @xmath54 mpc .",
    "such density is @xmath4130 times larger than the mean cosmic density of baryons today .",
    "we do not know the typical sizes , masses and gas densities of _ proto_clusters that can host powerful radio sources at @xmath55 .",
    "what we do know is that the large black holes ( @xmath56 ) required some time to accrete their masses . as an example , assuming a salpeter time of @xmath57 myr , the time needed by a @xmath58 black hole seed to reach @xmath20 is @xmath59 myr .",
    "if the seed mass is one hundred times larger , the time required is still @xmath60 myr .",
    "such timescales are long enough for an early agn to fully develop the extended radio lobes .",
    "in fact , the far end of the jet , assumed to be advancing at @xmath61 of the light speed , takes only 32 myr to reach a distance of @xmath411 mpc . as the proto",
    "cluster may have not completely formed yet at such high @xmath0 , it is likely that the density at 1 mpc from the center is similar to the average cosmic baryon density , i.e. @xmath62 ^ 3 $ ] @xmath51 .",
    "the above simple estimates show our point : at high redshifts the medium at @xmath63 mpc from a radio  loud agn ( where the jet dissipates its own energy ) has a density that , by chance , is similar to the density of the intracluster medium at @xmath54 mpc today . as a consequence ,",
    "radio lobes of similar power should have similar sizes .",
    "if the magnetic field is always around equipartition , it should have a similar value today and at @xmath64 .",
    "we can now study the physics of the interaction between the extended emission of a jet and the cmb in details .      as the energy density of the cosmic microwave background is @xmath65 where @xmath66 k is the cmb temperature today , the value of a magnetic field in equipartition with @xmath67 is @xmath68^{1/2 } \\",

    "relativistic electrons contained in a plasma where @xmath73 would preferentially cool down via ic , rather than synchrotron losses .",
    "consequently the radio emission is expected to be quenched , or severely weakened . in order to quantify the strength of such effect ,",
    "we need first to consistently determine the particle energy distribution .",
    "we will do this under the simplifying hypothesis of continuous injection of fresh particles , and we will account for radiative and adiabatic cooling .",
    "a further approximation is related to the fact that particles are likely injected ( i.e. , accelerated to relativistic energies ) by shocks in the hot spots , and from there they diffuse out to fill up the extended radio lobes .",
    "the particle energy distribution is therefore a function of the distance from the injection region . for simplicity , we evaluate instead an average distribution , adopting a spatially  averaged magnetic field .",
    "this can be thought as equivalent to observe the radio source with poor angular resolution .    with the above simplifying assumptions",
    ", the adiabatic and radiative cooling rates can be written as @xmath74 @xmath75 respectively , where @xmath76 is the expansion speed of the lobe , and @xmath77 is the energy density of synchrotron radiation as electrons cool also via the synchrotron self ",
    "compton ( ssc ) mechanism . for the conditions considered here these latter radiative losses",
    "are significantly smaller than synchrotron and ic ones off cmb photons , and can be thus safely neglected .    for a given extended region of length ",

    "this is strictly true in the case of steady continuous injection lasting a time @xmath105 .",
    "we must note however that even in this case the particle distribution may never reach a stationary state , since source expansion most likely decreases the average magnetic field ( see e.g. mocz , fabian & blundell 2011 ) . with such caveat in mind , we can now compute particle distributions and the relative emission spectra . to do so",

    "this means that at low radio frequencies the same source will have the same luminosity for any @xmath67 , i.e. , independent of redshift",
    ". it should be noted , however , that this could happen at electron energies corresponding to the self  absorbed part of the synchrotron spectrum , and therefore the effect could be difficult to observe , unless @xmath113 is significantly larger than the self  absorption energy .",

    "* if the hot spot is visible , but not the extended lobes , a classical double radio source can be misclassified as two different point  like radio sources at relatively large angular separation . as an example , a linear projected distance of 100 kpc is seen under an angle of 13 , 14.3 and 16 arcsec , at @xmath1533 , 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "therefore , when cross correlating sources in optical and radio catalogs , we could be missing some identifications just because a given optical source has no radio counterparts within a pre  assigned search radius .",
    "+ 0.2 cm + in conclusion , we have shown how enhanced inverse compton cooling of relativistic electron off cmb photons at high redshifts can potentially alter the radio and x  ray emissions of extended structures associated to radio  loud agns .",
    "this has important consequences for the statistics of distant radio sources .",
    "potentially , radio surveys could miss many high  redshift _ misaligned _ sources because of the reduced radio flux of their extended components .",
    "instead , in _ aligned _ sources ( i.e. in blazars ) , the observed flux comes predominantly from the relatively compact jet , whose radio emission is almost unaffected by the cmb .",
    "therefore blazars become the most powerful proxies to estimate the distribution and number density of the total ( i.e. parent ) population of radio sources , and to assess the number density of the associated heavy black holes .",
