    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be @xmath6-dimensional complete riemannian manifolds , and let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be two probability measures whose densities @xmath9 and @xmath10 are bounded away from zero and infinity .",
    "given a cost function @xmath11 , the optimal transport problem with cost @xmath12 consist in finding a transport map @xmath13 which sends @xmath14 onto @xmath15 and minimizes the transportation cost @xmath16 as shown by mccann @xcite extending the result of brenier @xcite on @xmath3 , if @xmath17 and @xmath18 then the optimal transport map ( or simply optimal map ) exists and is unique . more generally , the same result holds if the cost is semiconcave and satisfies the twist condition in assumption  [ a : twist ] , see @xcite .",
    "the optimal map @xmath19 is uniquely characterized by the relation @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a @xmath22-convex function ( called _ potential _ ) and @xmath23 denotes its @xmath22-subdifferential ( see section [ s : notation ] for the definitions ) .",

    "* lemma 3.1 ) . )",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the regularity issue of optimal maps when @xmath17 are multiple product of spheres , i.e. , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for some function @xmath29 , including the case @xmath30 of distance squared cost . for @xmath31 and @xmath30 ,",
    "smoothness of optimal maps has been proved by loeper @xcite . however",
    ", if @xmath32 the structure of the cut - locus ( the singular set of the cost function ) becomes more complicated , and due to the product structure , the manifold has both flat and positively curved directions , thus making the regularity issue much more delicate .",
    "especially , the powerful hlder regularity estimate of loeper @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as well as the a priori estimates of ma , trudinger and wang @xcite , which are successfully applied to positively curved manifolds as in @xcite , are not available any more in our setting .",
    "our main results ( theorem  [ t : stay - away ] and corollary  [ c : regularity ] ) give the first global regularity results which we are aware of concerning optimal maps on non - flat riemannian manifolds which allow vanishing sectional curvature . for completely flat manifolds",
    "( with @xmath33 ) the regularity of optimal maps is known as it reduces to the regularity theory of the classical monge - ampre equation @xcite .    to describe our result more precisely , first recall that in @xcite ma , trudinger and wang discovered condition * ( a3 ) * on the cost function , whose weaker variant * ( a3w ) * @xcite turned out to be both necessary @xcite and sufficient @xcite for regularity when the solution @xmath21 is known to be _ strictly _ @xmath22-convex and the cost function is smooth .",
    "when @xmath34 , the particular structure of the cut - locus ( for every point @xmath35 , its cut - locus @xmath36 consists of its antipodal point ) allowed delano and loeper @xcite to deduce that optimal maps _ stay away _ from cut - locus , namely , @xmath37 for all @xmath38 ; see @xcite for alternate approaches .",
    "loeper @xcite combined this observation with the fact that @xmath18 satisfies * ( a3 ) * to show regularity of optimal maps ; for a simpler approach to continuity , see @xcite .",
    "his result has been extended to variety of positively curved manifolds including the complex projective space @xcite and perturbation of the real projective space @xcite and of sphere @xcite , all of where * ( a3 ) * holds thus the strong hlder regularity estimate of @xcite as well as the a priori estimate of @xcite applies .",
    "note that * ( a3 ) * ( resp . * ( a3w ) * ) forces the sectional curvature to be positive ( resp .",
    "nonnegative ) @xcite , though the converse does not hold @xcite .",
    "on multiple products of spheres , taking @xmath18 leads to two main issues : first , only a degenerate strengthening of the weak ma - trudinger - wang condition holds ( the so - called _ non - negative cross - curvature _ condition in @xcite ) , which although stronger than * ( a3w ) * is not as useful as * ( a3 ) * for proving regularity due to lack of powerful estimates ; ( neither non - negative cross - curvature nor * ( a3 ) * implies the other , though either one separately implies * ( a3w ) * ) .",
    "moreover , the cut - locus now has a non - trivial structure , which makes it much more difficult to understand whether the stay - away property holds . in @xcite",
    "we showed strict @xmath22-convexity and @xmath39 regularity of @xmath21 , or equivalently , injectivity and continuity of @xmath19 , when the cost is smooth and non - negative cross - curvature holds .",
    "hence the only question left is whether @xmath40 avoids the cut - locus or not .    in this paper",
    "we answer this question positively : by taking advantage of the fact that the cut - locus is given by the union of certain sub - products of spheres we prove in theorem  [ t : stay - away ] the stay - away property that @xmath37 for all @xmath38 . by compactness",
    ", these two sets are separated by a uniform distance that is dependent on @xmath41 , but independent of the particular choice of @xmath21 and @xmath35 ; see corollary  [ c : uniform stay - away ] .",
    "once stay - away property is shown , one can localize the argument of @xcite to obtain injectivity and continuity of the optimal map ; then higher regularity ( @xmath42 ) of @xmath21 , thus @xmath43-regularity of @xmath19 , follows from @xcite when the densities are smooth ( @xmath44 ) ; see corollary  [ c : regularity ] .",
    "the multiple products of spheres is a model case for more general manifolds on which the cost @xmath22 satisfies the necessary conditions @xcite for regularity of optimal transport maps .",
    "the method we develop in this paper demonstrates one approach to handling complex singularities of the cost , especially the stay - away property of optimal maps .",
    "moreover , a general alexandrov type estimate ( lemma  [ l : left alex ] ) is obtained which has applications beyond the products of spheres .",
    "our regularity result has potential relevance to statistics and statistical mechanics .",
    "for instance , recently t. sei applied optimal transport theory for @xmath45 to directional statistics on the sphere . in his main result (",
    "* theorem 1 ) , he needed the optimal map not to touch the cut - locus .",
    "now , our stay - away property on multiple products of spheres @xmath4 ( theorem  [ t : stay - away ] ) states that all optimal maps , obtained by transporting densities bounded away from zero and infinity onto each other , satisfy this assumption .",
    "hence , this provides a large family of @xmath22-convex potentials that could be used to create log - concave likelihood functions as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 3.2 ) , extending his theory to multiple products of spheres .",
    "namely , as a direct consequence of @xcite , on multiple products of spheres a convex combination @xmath46 , @xmath47 , of @xmath22-convex functions @xmath48 is again @xmath22-convex , thus a crucial requirement in sei s theory is satisfied .",
    "if each @xmath48 is the @xmath22-potential of an optimal map between densities bounded away from zero and infinity , by theorem  [ t : stay - away ] one sees @xmath49 stay away from the cut - locus .",
    "one then can show that @xmath50 also avoids the cut - locus , thus applying ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) one obtains the log - concave jacobian inequality for this convex combination . to see this , for example , observe that in the product of spheres the domain of exponential map is convex and @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51})$ ] for @xmath38 ( see lemma  [ l : dasm for c - sub ] ) .",
    "since each @xmath49 stays away from the cut - locus , @xmath52 belongs to the domain of exponential map , so does @xmath53 , showing @xmath54 .",
    "concerning statistical mechanics , let us recall that the state of a spin system is classically modeled as a point in the phase space @xmath4 obtained by taking many products of spheres . in such contexts , optimal transport may provide a useful change of variables .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two smooth densities and @xmath19 denotes the optimal transport map from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , then @xmath55 for all bounded measurable functions @xmath56 .",
    "then , if @xmath14 is a `` nice '' measure for which many statistical quantities are easily computable , one may hope to exploit some qualitative / quantitative properties of @xmath19 in order to estimate the integral @xmath57 by studying @xmath58 .",
    "we expect that regularity of optimal maps may play a crucial role in this direction . for instance , in euclidean spaces this is already the case , as caffarelli @xcite used regularity of optimal maps to show that suitable monotonicity and log - concavity properties of the densities imply monotonicity and contraction properties for the optimal map , from which correlation and momentum inequalities may be deduced .",
    "+ * organization of the paper : * section  [ s : notation ] sets up the notation and assumptions used throughout the paper . in section  [ s : prelim ] , a few useful preliminary results regarding convex sets and @xmath22-convex functions are listed . section  [ s : left alex ] is devoted to an alexandrov type inequality which is one of the main tools in the proof of our main theorem . until section  [ s : left alex ] , we present the theory under rather general assumptions . however , from section  [ s : setting spheres ] we restrict to the multiple products of spheres . in section  [ s : setting spheres ] we state our main result about the stay - away property of optimal maps , and give a sketch of the proof .",
    "moreover we explain how one can deduce regularity of optimal maps combining this theorem with the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , the details of the proof of the stay - away property are given in section  [ s : proof ] .",

    "in this section and the next we recall notation and results which will be useful in the sequel .",
    "many of these results originated in or were inspired by the work of ma , trudinger , wang @xcite and loeper @xcite . though the present paper mainly concerns the riemannian distance squared cost @xmath18 on the product of round spheres , we will present our work in a rather general framework .",
    "it requires only a small additional effort and may prove useful for further development and applications of the theory .",
