    "<S> the fermi surface ( fs ) is usually given by two small hole pockets around the @xmath5 point and two electron pockets around the @xmath6 point in the 2-fe brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity of the competing spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state with @xmath7 suggests antiferromagnetic fluctuations as a mechanism for electron pairing . in this case , the natural order parameter for most of the fesc is the so - called @xmath2 state , described by an isotropic order parameter on each fs with the opposite signs for electronlike and holelike pockets . </S>",
    "<S> many experimental results , such as the nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate , the spin - resonance peak at the sdw wave vector @xmath8 in inelastic neutron scattering , and quasiparticle interference in tunneling experiments , are in good qualitative agrement with this scenario , although some materials are more anisotropic than others  @xcite .    since varying amounts of disorder are present in the materials , and </S>",
    "<S> because superconductivity is created in some cases by doping , it is important to understand the role of impurities . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that in an @xmath9 state , any nonmagnetic impurity which scatters _ solely _ between the bands with a different sign of the order parameter suppresses @xmath1 in the same way as a magnetic impurity in a single - band bcs superconductor  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the critical temperature @xmath1 should obey the abrikosov - gorkov ( ag ) formula @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the digamma function and @xmath12 is the critical temperature in the absence of impurities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the critical value of the scattering rate @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 within ag theory . </S>",
    "<S> however in several experiments on fesc , e.g. zn substitution or proton irradiation , it is found  @xcite that the @xmath1 suppression is much less than expected in the framework of ag theory . </S>",
    "<S> it has therefore been suggested that the @xmath9 state is not realized at all in these systems , and that a more conventional two - band order parameter without sign change ( @xmath3 ) is the more likely ground state  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the disorder problem in these systems is substantially more complicated than this simple argument suggests , however . even within the assumption of isotropic gaps on two different fermi pockets and nonmagnetic scattering , </S>",
    "<S> a much slower pair - breaking rate can be achieved by assuming that the scattering is primarily intraband rather than interband . in the pure intraband scattering limit </S>",
    "<S> , anderson s theorem applies , the system is insensitive to the sign of the order parameter , and no @xmath1 suppression occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of @xmath1 suppression therefore apparently depends on the interplay of both intraband and interband scattering rates , and drawing conclusions regarding the superconducting state based on systematic disorder studies is fundamentally more difficult than in one - band systems . </S>",
    "<S> one approach to this problem has been to try to determine the intraband and interband scattering potentials microscopically for each type of impurity and host  @xcite , but the quantitative applicability of band theory to such questions is unclear .    </S>",

    "<S> we find that the dependence of @xmath1 on impurity concentration is given by a universal form independent of impurity potentials , with respect to a generalized pair - breaking parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the form depends , however , on the ratio of interband to intraband pairing matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the average values of these matrix elements , we find there are two possible types of @xmath9 superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the one which has been largely discussed so far in the literature , for which @xmath16 is suppressed as disorder is increased , until it vanishes at a critical value of the scattering rate . </S>",
    "<S> there is however also a second type of @xmath9 state , one for which @xmath1 tends to a finite value as disorder increases ; at the same time the gap function acquires a uniform sign , i.e. , undergoes a transition from @xmath9 to @xmath3 .    _ model . </S>",
