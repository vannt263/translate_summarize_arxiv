    "there has been immense progress in the field of atomic and molecular scattering theory during the last two decades .",
    "computational methods such as r - matrix with pseudostates  @xcite , exterior complex scaling  @xcite , time - dependent close - coupling  @xcite , and convergent close - coupling ( ccc )  @xcite all set out to fully solve the underlying schrdinger equation without approximation",
    ". collisions involving electron , positron , or photon scattering on few - electron atoms and ions can now be routinely calculated accurately at any energy of interest .",
    "the ccc approach has also been recently extended to molecular targets  @xcite and heavy projectiles like antiprotons and protons@xcite .",
    "generally , further progress in the field comes from extending the capability to more complex collision systems .",
    "however , recently we found that a novel approach to the solution of the ccc equations yields greater utility when applied to ill - conditioned systems such as two - centre positron - atom scattering  @xcite .",
    "starting with the electron - hydrogen s - wave model , it was shown that the green s function in the ccc coupled lippmann - schwinger equations may be treated analytically , and thereby removing a somewhat problematic principal - value integral  @xcite . the full implementation  @xcite is applicable to electron or positron scattering on neutral targets . however , in the case of ionic targets there is considerable extra complexity due to the requirement for the inclusion of projectile bound states .",
    "extension to ionic targets is useful in its own right , and is also a requirement for the application of the ccc method to photon scattering  @xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence of the analytical approach is that the elimination of the singularity allows the application of the method at exact threshold energies . in the case of neutral targets",
    "this is useful when calculating the scattering length .",
    "however , for charged targets the excitation cross sections are non zero at threshold , and as we shall show , may be directly calculated .",
    "atomic units are used throughout unless specified otherwise .",
    "the general ideas behind the analytic treatment of the green s function in the lippmann - schinger equations have already been discussed earlier  @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on the extra complexity associated with charged targets . in such cases",
    "the projectile asymptotic hamiltonian contains the potential due to the asymptotic nuclear charge @xmath1 , leading to the projectile wave satisfying @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the projectile kinetic energy operator and @xmath4 is projectile momentum . in the case of electron scattering",
    "we have @xmath5 , and for the he@xmath0 target @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , the complete set in projectile space includes the countably infinite number of discrete states as well as the continuum .",
    "the resulting coupled lippmann - schwinger equations  @xcite take almost an identical form to the case of neutral targets except for the requirement to also include the bound states of the projectile of energy @xmath7 @xmath8 here @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the projectile final ( initial ) momentum , the notation @xmath11 is used to indicate the limit of @xmath12 as positive @xmath13 to ensure outgoing spherical wave boundary conditions , @xmath14 is the total spin of the system , @xmath15 are the interaction potentials and @xmath16 are the required transition amplitudes . for he@xmath0 the target wavefunctions @xmath17 of energy @xmath18 are obtained from the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "( [ cccorig ] ) is solved by first taking the complex part of the integral analytically to yield the equation for the @xmath3 matrix  @xcite @xmath19 where the required @xmath20 matrix is obtained from @xmath21 and where @xmath22 is the number of open states such that @xmath23 .",
    "the symbol @xmath24 indicates a principal value integral .",
    "a partial - wave expansion is utilised to solve eq .",
    "( [ cccorigk ] ) , with the numerical details for the original approach given in ref .",
    "briefly , the singularity in eq .",
    "( [ cccorigk ] ) , whenever @xmath23 , is treated using symmetric , about @xmath25 , quadratures .",
    "this is problematic near excitation thresholds ( @xmath26 ) , and whenever the system of equations is particularly ill - conditioned , such that the addition of large values either side of the singularity causes considerable precision loss .",
    "the latter circumstance is commonly the case for for positron scattering treated within the two - centre formalism  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach has been proposed , which treats the integral in the partial - wave expanded eq .",
    "( [ cccorigk ] ) analytically  @xcite . for neutral targets , following the introduction of several complete sets of states , the integral",

    "note that for closed channels @xmath31 , and @xmath25 is purely imaginary .",
    "the possibility of solving ( [ cccorig ] ) at zero incident energy , so as to obtain the scattering length ( via @xmath32 ) from a single calculation , was not considered previously , and we do so now . for @xmath33",
    "we only require @xmath34 for a non - zero cross section , and so eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) becomes @xmath35 there is no need to consider threshold excitation energies for neutral targets because the @xmath36 behaviour of @xmath37 for small @xmath38 ensures zero cross sections at threshold .    for charged targets",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated .",
    "now we utilise the result used in the coupled - channel optical approach  @xcite @xmath39 ,           \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 are the bound states , with energy @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the corresponding regular and irregular coulomb functions of energy @xmath44 ( negative for closed channels ) , respectively .",
    "coulomb waves for zero energy calculated using the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coul0 ] ) and the lhs with @xmath45 . the two results are almost indistinguishable over the full range of @xmath46 . ]    for charged targets the elastic cross section diverges as @xmath47 and so the scattering length is infinite .",
    "however , the cross sections at excitation thresholds corresponding to @xmath48 are finite for all @xmath49 , and may be calculated in the following way .",
    "we use @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the cylindrical bessel functions .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : c0 ] , and allows us to eliminate the division by @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ gc ] ) .",
    "a further problem is that the cross section is defined as @xmath53 , with @xmath54 at threshold .",
    "accordingly , we modify eq .",
    "( [ eq : kt ] ) by multiplying both sides by @xmath55 , which allows the removal of explicit multiplication by @xmath25 , leaving matrix elements of the form @xmath56 , which are non - zero for ions as @xmath57 .",
    "this leads to a non - zero cross section for @xmath54 and @xmath58 .",
    "having defined @xmath59 for all @xmath25 , we first define @xmath60 box - based states by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : proj ] ) for each @xmath49 with a specified box size @xmath61 . for @xmath62",
    "these will include as many bound states ( @xmath63 ) as @xmath61 allows .",
    "we then proceed as previously  @xcite , and define @xmath64 with the final equation to be solved being @xmath65 which has no singularities .",
    "convergence in the solution of eq .",
    "( [ cccnew ] ) is obtained with increasing @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "note that there are no substantially extra computational resources required in the evaluating eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) due to the near - separable nature of @xmath66 .",
    "we begin by considering the e - h scattering system to demonstrate that both the numerical ( ngf ) and analytical ( agf ) approaches to treating the green s function in eq .",
    "( [ cccorig ] ) yield the same results at all energies .",
    "furthermore , only the analytical approach may be applied at exactly zero projectile energy .",
    "the zeroth partial wave suffices for our purposes .",
    "the target states are taken to have @xmath67 and @xmath68 with laguerre exponential parameter @xmath69 .",
    "an energy range varying over six orders of magnitude is considered , though no attempt is made to make it sufficiently dense to map out any resonance structures .",
    "the e - h cross sections for elastic scattering and 2s , and 2p excitation are presented in fig .",
    "we see excellent agreement between the two approaches across all energies and for all transitions . for elastic scattering",
    "the arrows indicate the agf calculation performed at exactly zero energy .",
    "as required , it is consistent with those performed at very small energies , and yields a scattering lengths @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "note that the cross sections are plotted against energy above threshold , which emphasizes the near - threshold behaviour , where they start from zero .",
    "we next consider e - he@xmath0 scattering using the same parameters as for the e - h system , with the cross sections presented in fig .",
    "the elastic cross sections have been multiplied by the incident energy to check the expected divergence .",
    "it is clear that the original ngf approach struggles to yield the correct behaviour close to thresholds in all presented cases .",
    "while we can improve the given ngf results , this requires going out to very large radial coordinates so as to incorporate more bound states . in the original formulation the approach to summation over the bound states and integration over the continuum are entirely separate .",
    "however , in the agf approach increasing @xmath61 systematically affects both .",
    "furthermore , for excitation , the agf approach is clearly consistent with calculations exactly at the thresholds , as indicated by the arrows .",
    "it should be said that the presentation deliberately emphasises the near threshold energies .",
    "away from these regions the agreement between the ngf and agf calculations is excellent .",
    "though not presented , we have checked that the behaviour for higher partial waves is much the same as presented here for the zeroth partial wave .    ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the @xmath72 results when the projectile energy is set to zero , allowing for the determination of the scattering length @xmath73 via @xmath74 from a single calculation .",
    "the calculations have been performed at the specified points connected by straight lines to help guide the eye .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]     except for the he@xmath0 target .",
    "now the arrows indicate the ( non - zero ) cross sections when the projectile energy is set to the threshold of excitation .",
    "note that since the elastic cross section diverges as @xmath75 , it has been multiplied by the incident projectile energy @xmath76 .",
    "the analytic approach to treating the green s function in the coupled lippmann - schwinger equations of the ccc method has been implemented for charged targets , and at threshold energies . as a consequence it has the same utility as the original numerical approach for electron , positron or photon scattering .",
    "earlier we have found that the analytical approach yields less ill - conditined systems in the case of two - centre positron - atom scattering  @xcite .",
    "here we have demonstrated a more accurate treatment of the electron - ion collision system in the vicinity of thresholds .",
