    "one of classical problems in astronomy and physics is the three - body problem in newtonian gravity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational three - body problem is not integrable by analytical methods .",
    "as particular solutions , however , euler and lagrange found a collinear solution and an equilateral triangular one , respectively .",
    "the solutions to the restricted three - body problem , where one of the three bodies is a test particle , are known as lagrangian points @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "lagrange s equilateral triangular solution has also a practical importance , since @xmath2 and @xmath1 for the sun - jupiter system are stable and indeed the trojan asteroids are located there . even for the sun - earth system , asteroids were also found around @xmath2 by recent observations @xcite .",
    "recently , lagrangian points have attracted renewed interests for relativistic astrophysics @xcite , where they have discussed the post - newtonian ( pn ) corrections for lagrangian points @xcite , and the gravitational radiation reaction on @xmath2 and @xmath1 analytically @xcite and by numerical methods @xcite .",
    "it is currently important to reexamine lagrangian points in the framework of general relativity . as a pioneering work @xcite",
    ", nordtvedt has pointed out that the location of the triangular points is very sensitive to the ratio of the gravitational mass to the inertial one , though his analysis does not fully take account of the first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) terms .",
    "along this course , it might be important as a gravity experiment to discuss the three - body coupling terms in the pn force , because some of the terms are proportional to a product of three masses such as @xmath3 .",
    "such a triple product appears only for relativistic three ( or more ) body systems but it does not for relativistic compact binaries nor newtonian three - body systems .",
    "in addition , it has been pointed out that three - body interactions might play important roles for compact binary mergers in hierarchical triple systems @xcite .",
    "very recently , moreover , a first relativistic hierarchical triple system has been discovered by ransom and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "for three finite masses , in the 1pn approximation , the existence and uniqueness of a pn collinear solution corresponding to euler s one have been shown by yamada and asada @xcite . also , ichita et al .",
    ", including two of the present authors , have shown that an equilateral triangular solution is possible at the 1pn order , if and only if all the three masses are equal @xcite .",
    "generalizing this earlier work , yamada and asada have found a _",
    "pn triangular _ equilibrium solution for general masses with 1pn corrections to each side length @xcite .",
    "this pn triangular configuration for general masses is not always equilateral and it recovers the previous results by krefetz @xcite and maindl @xcite for the restricted three - body case .    in newtonian gravity , gascheau proved that lagrange s equilateral triangular configuration for circular motion is stable @xcite , if @xmath4 routh extended the result to a general law of gravitation @xmath5 , and found the condition for stability as @xcite @xmath6 for the restricted three - body limit as @xmath7 , douskos and perdios examined the stability of @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) in the 1pn approximation , and they obtained a region of stability as @xcite @xmath8 where we assume @xmath9 without loss of generality , the newtonian value @xmath10 , and we define @xmath11 for the total mass @xmath12 and each side length @xmath13 of the newtonian equilateral triangle . singh and",
    "bello also discussed the stability in the restricted three - body problem by taking account of not only the general relativistic effects but also radiation pressure and a small perturbation in the centrifugal force @xcite . for three finite masses , however , it is not clear whether the pn triangular configuration is stable . in this paper",
    ", we study this issue by _ fully _ taking account of all the 1pn terms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ solution ] , we briefly summarize the pn triangular equilibrium solution for three finite masses . in sec .",
    "[ stability ] , we consider the stability of the solution at the 1pn order . section [ conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "hereafter , we take the units of @xmath14 .",
    "we consider a pn triangular configuration with 1pn corrections to each side length of a newtonian equilateral triangle , so that the distances between the bodies are @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is dimensionless pn corrections ( see fig .",
    "[ c5fig : fig - pn - tri ] ) .",
    "because of the circular motion , @xmath13 and @xmath22 are constants .",
    "note that we neglect the terms of second ( and higher ) order in @xmath23 henceforth . here , if all the three corrections are equal ( i.e. @xmath24 ) , a pn configuration is still an equilateral triangle , though each side length is changed by a scale transformation as @xmath25 .",
    "namely , one of the degrees of freedom for the pn corrections corresponds to a scale transformation , and this is unimportant . in order to eliminate this degree of freedom ,",
    "we impose a constraint condition @xmath26 which means that the arithmetical mean of the three distances of the bodies is not changed by the pn corrections .",
    "namely , @xmath27 please see also ref .",
    "@xcite for imposing this constraint .",
    "the pn triangular configuration becomes an equilibrium solution in the circular motion if and only if the following conditions ( a ) and ( b ) simultaneously hold : ( a ) the term proportional to @xmath43 vanishes and ( b ) all the angular velocities are the same .    as a result",

    "next , we study the stability of the pn triangular solution by taking account of linear perturbations in the orbital plane .",
    "it is convenient to use the corotating coordinates with the origin as the center of mass even after adding perturbations .",
    "therefore , the number of the degrees of freedom for the perturbations decreases from six to four .",
