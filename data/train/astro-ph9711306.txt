    "the delay of high - energy photons relative to low - energy photons in the x - ray brightness variations of cygnus  x-1 has been known for some time .",
    "the significance of these lags is their possible use as a diagnostic of the source of compton upscattering of soft photons widely believed to be the origin of the hard spectral tail seen in cyg  x-1 and other black hole candidates ( bhcs ) ( miller 1995 ; nowak & vaughan 1996 ) , as a probe of the dynamics of the comptonization region itself ( miyamoto et al . 1988 ) , and as a second - order statistic supplementary to the power spectrum in the determination of parameters in shot - noise models ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "the lags have been investigated using cross spectral analyses of the time variations of the source in different energy channels ( van der klis et al .",
    "1995 ; see also lewin , van paradijs & van der klis 1988 ) .",
    "miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1989 , 1992 , 1993 ) have applied this technique to the bhcs cyg  x-1 , gx 339@xmath24 , gs 2023 + 338 , and gs 1124@xmath2338 with ginga data , using various combinations of energy channels from 237 kev and a maximum sampling frequency of 125 hz ( nyquist frequency , @xmath3 = 62.5 hz ) .",
    "their results showed that the lag spectra of these bhcs ( i.e. , lags as a function of fourier frequency ) were very similar , severally for the low state and the very high state which were covered in their observations .",
    "the amplitude of the lag in general increases with photon energy , @xmath4 , except , perhaps , for @xmath5 kev .",
    "this consistent picture led miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1992 ) to refer to this lag properties as ` canonical ' for bhc sources .",
    "the other type of x - ray binary for which the lag spectra have been well studied are the z sources .",
    "these contain accreting neutron stars ; they show different power spectral features , and have different lag properties ( van der klis et al .",
    "1987 ) .    in general , the results of miyamoto",
    "et al . ( 1993 ) show a phase lag that increases as a function of frequency up to approximately @xmath65 hz , then decreases toward @xmath3 . at the highest frequencies ,",
    "the uncertainties in the lag values become large enough to make the determination of any trend uncertain .",
    "the corresponding time lags decrease as the frequency increases towards @xmath3 where they are consistent with zero . at least in cyg",
    "x-1 , the phase lags depend on the average energies @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the energy bands used approximately as @xmath9 ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "we have used the approximately 2000 days of data from the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ to investigate x - ray lags in variations from cyg x-1 , in a higher energy range than previously possible .",
    "our data cover a large range in hard x - ray intensity and spectral slope ( see crary et al .",
    "1996 , and the x - ray light curves in paciesas et al .",
    "1997 ) ; our observations include time intervals in which an ultra - soft component is present ; during these intervals cyg x-1 was likely in the high or intermediate state ( see zhang et al .",
    "1997 ; belloni et al .",
    "a description of the data analysis is given in the next section . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we compare our results to those of miyamoto et al . , and present our conclusions .",
    "we calculated lags between the 2050 and 50100 kev energy bands of the @xmath10 s time resolution data obtained with the large - area detectors ( lads ) . fast",
    "fourier transforms were calculated in a way identical to that discussed in crary et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , with the addition of later observations .",
    "these transforms were created for 524.288 second intervals ( 512 time bins ) in two energy channels , for all detectors with an angle of less than @xmath11 to the direction of cyg  x-1 ( from one to four detectors view the source during a particular pointing period ) .",
    "the average number of uninterrupted 512 bin segments available with the source unocculted by the earth is approximately 40 per day .",
    "the complex cross amplitudes were created from the fourier amplitudes @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the number of time bins , @xmath14 is the detector count rate in bin @xmath15 and channel number @xmath16 , and @xmath17 corresponds to fourier frequencies @xmath18 .",
    "the cross spectra were normalized to the total detector count rates @xmath19 in channel @xmath20 , by analogy with the method of leahy et al .",
    "1983 ) , and are given by @xmath21 , where the brackets refer to daily averaging .",
    "errors on the averages of the real and imaginary parts of cross spectrum were calculated from their respective sample variances . for further averages of the cross spectrum",
    "these errors were propagated .",
    "the phase lag as a function of frequency is obtained from the cross spectrum as @xmath22}$ ] . with the above definitions , lags in the hard x - ray variations",
    "appear as positive angles . for these data ,",
    "deadtime induced cross - channel effects ( van der klis et al .",
    "1987 ) will affect only the real part of the cross spectrum , reducing it by less then 5% .",
    "because of the properties of the fourier amplitudes ( van der klis 1989 ; leahy et al . 1983 ) and the noise in the uncollimated batse detectors , the cross spectra for a large number of days must be averaged and converted to lag values to obtain sufficiently small errors . as shown by crary et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) the slope of the x - ray spectrum of cyg  x-1 and the amplitude of the variability are strongly correlated .",
    "this indicates also that within the low state the properties of cyg  x-1 are determined by a simple parameter , most likely the mass accretion rate .",
    "we have therefore used the squared fractional rms amplitude of the noise , integrated over the @xmath23 hz frequency range , as the relevant quantity with which to correlate the lag properties .",
    "figure 1b - d shows the data grouped into three parts , i.e.  those for which the daily averaged squared fractional rms values ( between 0.03 and 0.488 hz ) are greater than 0.03 and less that 0.05 , between 0.05 and 0.07 , and greater than 0.07 , respectively .",
    "the figure shows that to within the uncertainties , there is no obvious trend in the lag spectrum with source state .",
    "figure 1a presents results obtained by averaging the cross spectra over the set of data with fractional rms squared values greater than 0.03 .",
    "these data show that at the lowest frequencies , the frequency dependence of the phase lag is consistent with zero phase lag ; the phase lag rises to a peak value of 0.04 radians near 0.2 hz and decreases above this point to a value to near zero radians at the @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting time lags , @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the frequency in hz of the @xmath26th frequency bin ) , are shown in figure [ fig2 ] ( filled circles ) .",
    "these show a roughly power - law decrease above @xmath27 hz ( exponent @xmath28 ) with a break above 0.1 hz , beyond which they decrease much more quickly .",
    "the shape of the phase lag spectrum looks superficially like that found by miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for cyg  x-1 and by miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for gs  1124 - 68 and gx  339 - 4 . for the case of cyg",
    "x-1 , however , the turn over in their phase lag spectrum occurred at @xmath29 hz , and these lags decreased to near zero at their nyquist frequency ( 62.5 hz ) .",
    "the similarity in the shape of these spectra over the sampling time dependent frequency range suggests , by analogy with the finite - sampling effects in power spectral analyses ( van der klis 1989 ) , that at least part of this shape ( in particular the decrease toward the nyquist frequency ) is determined by binning and aliasing effects on the cross spectrum .",
    "the effect of finite sampling on cross spectrum and lags can be calculated in a way similar to the analogous problem in the determination of power spectra ( van der klis 1989 ; see also maejima et al .",
    "1984 ) .    the discrete form of the cross spectrum @xmath30 for the pair of binned",
    ", continuous random functions @xmath31 with zero mean ( with @xmath26 equals 1 or 2 ) in terms of the cross spectrum @xmath32 of @xmath33 and @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath13 is the number of bins in a data segment , @xmath37 is the bin width , and @xmath38 .",
    "the sum over k represents the aliasing in the frequency domain due to the uniform sampling in the time domain ( van der klis 1989 ) , and the @xmath39 terms represent the effect of the averaging of the data over the finite time bin width .    to investigate the effect of binning on the phase and time lags , it is necessary to model the cross spectrum at frequencies above @xmath3",
    "here we assume a cross spectrum of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , the modulus of the cross spectrum , is independent of the detailed structure of the time lag @xmath42 as a function of frequency , and the difference between the real and imaginary parts of the cross spectrum is determined by the complex exponential depending on @xmath43 .",
    "this phenomenological model has the simple interpretation that for @xmath42 independent of @xmath0 it represents a constant time lag .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the cross spectrum are plotted in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the shape of the real part of the cross spectrum is suggestive of the shape of a typical power spectrum , showing a ` flat top ' at low frequency and a break at @xmath44 hz to a power law form at higher frequencies ( belloni & hasinger 1991 ; crary et al .",
    "1996b ) . to test the validity of the simple model for the cross spectrum ,",
    "we have modeled @xmath41 with a lorentzian - type function @xmath45 , and assume that the time lag has a simple power - law form , @xmath46 from an inspection of the shape of the time lags in figure [ fig2 ] at a point well away from @xmath3 .",
    "these five parameters were then determined by a simultaneous fit of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath47 to the cross spectral data .",
    "the best fit parameters are found to be @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 for @xmath41 , and @xmath51 , @xmath52 for @xmath43 .",
    "using the binning correction to this cross spectrum model , the fit to the data is shown as the dashed line in figure [ fig3 ] . without binning ,",
    "the fit form is given by the dotted line in figure [ fig3 ] . because of the small values of @xmath42 which are observed , the fit values are insensitive to the exact functional from of @xmath43 , but the binning correction is a large effect .",
    "the effect of binning on the time lags calculated from this model is shown in figure [ fig2 ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "we find that the time lag , away from @xmath3 depends on frequency , @xmath0 , approximately as @xmath53 up to @xmath54hz . above this frequency , the lags downturn , most of which is an artifact due to the data binning .",
    "it should be stressed that these results are not meant to provide a definitive description of the cross spectra , but to illustrate the important effect of binning on the lag spectrum at frequencies above @xmath55 . in this model ,",
    "the calculation of the time lags is not sensitive to the the detailed shape of @xmath41 , but it is clearly not adequately described by a simple lorentzian - like function .",
    "other potential systematic effects on the cross spectrum , such as ` windowing ' in the time domain ( van der klis 1989 ) , have not been considered . however , the implications of this simple model are clear",
    ". at least part of the decrease in the time lags with frequency observed by miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1993 ) must be attributed to binning effects . to obtain a precise determination of the phase or time lag as a function of frequency ,",
    "these effects must be considered , or , since this effect dominates near the @xmath3 frequency , frequencies above @xmath56 should be ignored .",
    "since we find that the lags are independent of rms fractional x - ray flux variations , we have combined our time lag results with those obtained by miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for cyg x-1 .",
    "this allows us to study the photon energy dependence of the time lags over a much increased energy range .",
    "miyamoto et al . ( 1989 ) found that the time lags between energy bands with average energies @xmath8 and @xmath7 are proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "for power law photon indices between @xmath58 and @xmath59 we find that for the batse energy bands @xmath60 is in the range 0.802 and 0.833 . to avoid the binning effects",
    "we have taken the time lag at @xmath61  hz , for which we find @xmath62  s. then the proportionality constant between time lag and the logarithm of the energy ratio @xmath63 . at the same frequency",
    "we infer from figure 3 of miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1989 ) lags of 0.045 s , 0.030 s , and 0.088 s between the 1.24.7 kev and 4.79.3 kev bands , between the 4.79.3 kev and 9.314.0 kev bands , and between the 4.79.3 kev and 15.824.4 kev bands , respectively .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath64 are 0.045 , 0.060 and 0.080 , respectively ( estimated accuracy @xmath65 percent ) .",
    "this indicates that between the energy ranges below 10 kev and above 10 kev the ratio @xmath64 of the time lags to @xmath66 increases ; however , between @xmath65 and 100 kev @xmath64 does not change within the accuracy with which it has been determined .",
    "based on our analysis of nearly 2000 days of batse data we have studied the time lags between the x - ray flux variations of cyg x-1 in the 2050 kev and 50100 kev bands as a function of fourier frequency .",
    "we find that the time lag spectra do not depend on source state as measured by the rms fractional variations of the x - ray flux . over the range 0.010.2",
