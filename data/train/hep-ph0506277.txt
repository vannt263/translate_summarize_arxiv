    "exclusive reactions @xmath5 which may be accessed in @xmath6 collisions have been shown @xcite to have a partonic interpretation in the kinematical region of large virtuality of one photon and of small center of mass energy .",

    "@xcite raised the problem of @xmath1 enhancement with respect to @xmath0 at low energies .",
    "one of the solutions of this problem was based on the prediction @xcite and further exploration @xcite of the possible existence of isotensor state , whose interference with the isoscalar state is constructive for neutral mesons and destructive for charged ones .",
    "this option was also independently considered in @xcite .",
    "the crucial property of such an exotic state is the absence of @xmath12 wave function at any momentum resolution . in other words ,",
    "quark - antiquark component is absent both in its non - relativistic description and at the level of the light - cone distribution amplitude .",
    "this is by no means common : for instance , the @xmath13 state which is a quark - gluon hybrid at the non - relativistic level is described by a leading twist quark - antiquark distribution amplitude @xcite .",
    "contrary to that , an isotensor state on the light cone corresponds to the twist @xmath14 or higher and its contribution is thus power suppressed at large @xmath9 .",
    "this is supported by the mentioned l3 data , where the high @xmath9 ratio two of the cross sections of charged and neutral mesons production points out an isoscalar state .",
    "we studied both perturbative and non - perturbative ingredients of qcd factorization for the description of an isotensor state .",
    "namely , we calculated the twist @xmath14 coefficient function and extracted the non - perturbative matrix elements from l3 data . our analysis is compatible with the existence of an isotensor exotic meson with a mass around @xmath15 gev .",
    "the reaction which we study here is @xmath17 , where @xmath3 stands for the triplet @xmath3 mesons ; the initial electron @xmath18 radiates a hard virtual photon with momentum @xmath19 , with @xmath20 quite large .",
    "this means that the scattered electron @xmath21 is tagged . to describe the given reaction , it is useful to consider the sub - process @xmath22 . regarding the other photon momentum @xmath23",
    ", we assume that , firstly , its momentum is almost collinear to the electron momentum @xmath24 and , secondly , that @xmath25 is approximately equal to zero , which is a usual approximation when the second lepton is untagged .    in two @xmath3 meson production , we are interested in the channel where the resonance corresponds to the exotic isospin , _ i.e",
    "_ @xmath26 , and usual @xmath27 quantum numbers . the @xmath27 quantum numbers are not essential for our study .",
    "because the isospin @xmath2 has only a projection on the four quark correlators , the study of mesons with the isospin @xmath2 can help to throw light upon the four quark states .",
    "we thus , together with the mentioned reactions , study the following processes : @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where meson @xmath30 possesses isospin @xmath26 .",

    "the photon polarization vectors read @xmath37 for the real and virtual photons , respectively .",
    "the coefficient functions of twist @xmath2 operators to operator product expansion of currents product in ( [ amp01 ] ) were discussed in detail in @xcite , while the contributions of new twist @xmath14 operators are described by coefficient functions calculated long ago in @xcite when considering the problem of twist @xmath14 corrections to deep inelastic scattering .",

    "the four quark gda s @xmath51 can be defined in an analogous manner as the two quark gda s .",
    "hence , one can see that the amplitudes ( [ amp01 ] ) for @xmath1 and @xmath0 productions can be written in the form of the decomposition : @xmath52 where the subscripts @xmath2 and @xmath14 in the amplitudes imply that the given amplitudes are associated with the two and four quark correlators , respectively .",
    "the amplitudes corresponding to @xmath0 production are not independent and can be expressed through the corresponding amplitudes of @xmath1 production .",

    "the fitting of lep data based on the qcd factorization of the amplitude into a hard subprocess and a generalized distribution amplitude thus allows us to claim evidence of the existence of an isospin @xmath26 exotic meson @xcite with a mass in the vicinity of @xmath4 and a width around @xmath106 .",
    "the contributions of such an exotic meson in the two @xmath3 meson production cross sections ( see , ( [ xsec7 ] ) and ( [ xsec8 ] ) ) are directly associated with some twist @xmath14 terms that we have identified . at large @xmath9 , these twist @xmath14 contributions become negligible and the behaviours of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 cross sections are controlled by the leading twist @xmath2 contributions , see fig .",
    "[ rho0rho02 ] and [ rho+rho-2 ] . figs .",
    "[ rho0rho0 ] and [ rho+rho- ] show the increasing role of higher twist contributions when decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "namely , the interference between twist @xmath2 and @xmath14 amplitudes gives the dominant contributions to @xmath1 production in the lower @xmath9 interval , and is thus responsible of the @xmath79 dependence of the cross section in these kinematics . in particular ,",
    "in this interference term the main contribution arises from the interference between isoscalar and isotensor structures , see the long - dashed lines on fig .",
    "[ rho0rho0 ] and [ rho+rho- ] .",
    "@xmath100{fig55.eps}\\ ] ]    analysing the @xmath9 dependence , we can see that due to the presence of a twist @xmath14 amplitude and its interference with the leading twist @xmath2 component , the @xmath1 cross section at small @xmath9 is a few times higher than the @xmath0 cross section , see fig .",
    "[ rhorho1 ] . while for the region of large @xmath9 where any higher twist effects are negligible the @xmath1 cross section is less than the @xmath0 cross section by the factor @xmath2 , which is typical from an isosinglet channel ( see also ( [ xsec7 ] ) and ( [ xsec8 ] ) ) .    the reaction @xmath107 and its qcd analysis in the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite thus proves its efficiency to reveal facts on hadronic physics which would remain quite difficult to explain in a quantitative way otherwise .",
    "the leading twist dominance is seen to persist down to values of @xmath9 around @xmath105 .",
    "other aspects of qcd may be revealed in different kinematical regimes through the same reaction @xcite .",
    "its detailed experimental analysis at intense electron colliders within the babar and belle experiments is thus extremely promising .",
    "data at higher energies in a future linear collider should also be foreseen .",
    "note that the non - perturbative calculations of the relevant @xmath26 twist @xmath14 matrix elements also deserve special interest .",
    "in particular , one may follow the ideas developed for pion distribution @xcite which allowed to relate higher and lower twists in multicolour qcd .",
    "the generalization for the case of @xmath3 mesons , anticipated by the authors of @xcite , and use of crossing relations between various kinematical domains provided by radon transform technique @xcite may allow to apply these result in the case under consideration .    in conclusion ,",
    "let us stress that the l3 data allows to estimate the contribution of higher twist four quark light cone distribution to the production amplitude of vector meson pairs .",
    "our numerical analysis leads to a rather small width for the corresponding resonant state , which is nothing else as an exotic four - quark isotensor meson . at the same time , a more elaborate experimental , theoretical and numerical analysis is required to confirm , with better accuracy , the smallness of the width and the existence of an exotic meson .",
