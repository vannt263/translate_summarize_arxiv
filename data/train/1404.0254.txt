    "in the study of dissipative systems the case of strictly ohmic damping plays a prominent role because it implies memoryless damping .",
    "however , this model is the result of an idealization which assumes that the density of the environmental modes weighted by the coupling strength increases proportional to the frequency even for arbitrarily large frequencies . in realistic scenarios",
    ", this will not be the case and , on a more formal level , it can give rise to divergencies . therefore , one is usually obliged to introduce a high - frequency cutoff in the spectral density of the coupling . often one can assume that the cutoff represents the largest frequency scale in the problem and that the resulting memory time of the damping is shorter than any time scale of interest .    while the cutoff in the spectral density of the coupling usually only leads to quantitative changes of relatively little physical interest , occasionally the presence of a cutoff can make a qualitative difference . here , we will consider such a situation .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of a free damped particle at low temperatures depend significantly on an environment - induced renormalization of the particle s mass .",
    "in particular , there exists a regime , where the mass renormalization can be negative and thus reduces the mass of the particle . when the renormalized mass becomes negative , one observes anomalies like a negative specific heat @xcite .",
    "such anomalies in the specific heat and in the entropy are of interest in various contexts @xcite .",
    "the mass renormalization alluded to here is due to the suppression of the density of high - frequency environmental modes and thus is a direct consequence of the very existence of a cutoff in the spectral density of the coupling .",
    "we will consider in this paper the specific heat of a free brownian particle subject to a linear environment where the spectral density of the coupling at low frequencies follows a general power law . at high frequencies we allow either for an algebraic cutoff which in the simplest case will take the form of a drude cutoff or for a sharp cutoff where no environmental modes are assumed to be present above a certain cutoff frequency .",
    "it will become clear that these two cutoff functions can lead to quantitatively quite different results .",
    "in particular , we will find that for a sharp cutoff the appearance of a negative specific heat can not be inferred from the leading low - temperature behavior .    before embarking on our study , we need to say a few words about the meaning of a negative specific heat which usually should provoke worries about thermodynamic instability . however , here we are referring to the specific heat of a system degree of freedom coupled to an environment .",
    "it turns out that beyond weak coupling , the specific heat of a dissipative quantum system is not uniquely defined @xcite . here",
    ", we will base our considerations on the reduced partition function @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the partition function of the coupled ensemble of system and bath while @xmath2 refers to the partition function of the bath alone . in the absence of any coupling between system and bath",
    ", the reduced partition function clearly agrees with the partition function of the system alone .",
    "we can now employ standard relations of thermodynamics to obtain any thermodynamic quantity from the reduced partition function ( [ eq : reduced_partition_function ] ) .",
    "the resulting quantities have a clear physical significance as the difference between the quantity of system and bath and the same quantity determined for the bath alone . for the specific heat",
    ", we have @xcite @xmath3 while each of the terms , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , has to be positive , their difference can very well become negative and in fact it does under appropriate circumstances .",
    "the physical reason is the suppression of the bath density of states at low frequencies when the system degree of freedom is coupled to it @xcite .",
    "how strongly the bath density of states will be suppressed depends directly on the high - frequency cutoff of the spectral density of the coupling .",

    "the corresponding spectral damping functions will be deduced and their properties will be presented .",
    "the section closes with a discussion of the mass renormalization associated with the two models .",
    "this quantity will play an important role for the thermodynamic anomalies in the specific heat .",

    "all properties of the damped free particle can be expressed in terms of the causal velocity response function @xmath9 whose laplace transform can immediately be read off from ( [ eq : equation_of_motion ] ) as @xmath10 the two terms in the denominator are associated with the inertia term and the damping term , respectively .    although in principle it is sufficient to specify the spectral damping function @xmath8 , it is useful to consider an explicit model leading to ( [ eq : equation_of_motion ] ) .",

    "the relative mass renormalization @xmath84 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : massrenormalization ] as a function of the exponent @xmath22 both for an algebraic cutoff with @xmath93 ( solid line ) and a sharp cutoff ( dashed line ) . for @xmath89 ,",

    "the divergence lies at @xmath69 .",
    "in contrast , the mass renormalization for the sharp cutoff decreases monotonically as @xmath22 increases .",
    "we remark that although for @xmath93 the mass renormalization for an algebraic cutoff always exceeds the one for the sharp cutoff , this is generally not true for larger values of @xmath43 .     as a function of the exponent @xmath22 of the spectral density of the coupling @xmath95 .",
    "the solid curve depicts @xmath96 for an algebraic cutoff with @xmath93 according to ( [ eq : massrenorm1 ] ) while the dashed curve refers to the sharp cutoff , i.e. the expression ( [ eq : massrenorm2 ] ) .",

    "hence the interpretation just given for the relative mass contribution @xmath84 ceases to hold .",
    "nevertheless , the expressions ( [ eq : massrenorm1 ] ) , ( [ eq : massrenorm2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : massrenorm3 ] ) can be analytically continued to the regime @xmath101 . to show this , we write @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath88 , substitution of the expression ( [ eq : specdenspowerlaw ] ) for @xmath27 in ( [ eq : gammahatspectraldensity ] ) results in the first term appearing in the series expressions ( [ eq : gamseriesac ] ) and ( [ eq : gamseriessc ] ) . with the residual contribution of @xmath95 , the integral expression ( [ eq : gammahatspectraldensity ] ) is regular in linear order of @xmath58 and yields @xmath103 in this order .",

    "we see that indeed the critical damping strength for model ii is generally larger than for model i. for ohmic damping , the critical damping strength is typically of the order of the cutoff frequency and it is therefore not surprising , that the cutoff influences the thermodynamic quantities in a significant way .",
    "however , when the exponent @xmath22 approaches a value of 2 or , in the case of an algebraic cutoff , approaches zero , the critical damping strength can be much smaller than the cutoff frequency .     as a function of the exponent @xmath22 in the regime @xmath63 .",
    "the two solid curves show @xmath113 ( model i ) for @xmath93 ( upper curve ) and @xmath112 ( lower curve ) while the dashed line depicts @xmath114 ( model ii ) . ]",
    "we finally allude again that the notion of a critical damping strength @xmath97 becomes meaningless in the regime @xmath115 , since there the analytical continuation , inter alia of ( [ eq : gamma_cr_model1 ] ) or ( [ eq : gamma_cr_model2 ] ) , yields a negative value for @xmath97 .",
    "there are two different views about the specific heat of an open quantum system : ( i ) it can be viewed as specific heat of the system modified by the coupling to the heat bath .",
