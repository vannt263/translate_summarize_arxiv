    "classical mechanics of simple , low dimensional and integrable systems can be surprisingly rich , provided that non - linearity is present . these systems ,",
    "although less complex than the chaotic ones , hardly allow for full analytical treatments and may present behaviors like reverse rotations , excitability , transients and hysteresis , thus , constituting an important resource in basic physics .",
    "not less importantly , for obvious reasons , all sorts of machinery in industries work in non - chaotic regimes , however , displaying a variety of complex dynamical effects arising from non - linearities .",
    "one class of problems that has been often considered in the literature is that of rigid body dynamics on flat surfaces .",
    "farkas et al have explored the subtle connection between translational and spinning motions of a free disk ( of radius @xmath0 ) moving on a surface with coulombian friction @xcite .",
    "they showed , e. g. , that the terminal translational ( @xmath1 ) and rotational ( @xmath2 ) velocities , vanish simultaneously , and that the ratio @xmath3 always tends to @xmath4 in the imminence of stopping , no matter its initial value ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "complementarily , the motion of driven disks sliding on frictionless surfaces has been shown to be quite non - trivial regarding a dynamical behavior called reverse rotation @xcite .",
    "the position of a rigid body in two dimensions is completely characterized by the location of its center of mass ( c.m . ) and by the angle between some reference line marked on the body and an arbitrary coordinate axis .",
    "a reverse rotation develops when the c. m. follows a bounded trajectory in , say , the clockwise direction and , at the same time , the intrinsic angular degree of freedom evolves counterclockwise , or vice - versa .",
    "thus , a reverse rotation is characterized by antiparallel orbital and spin rotations .",
    "famous examples of such a phenomenon are the reverse , or retrograde , rotations of venus @xcite and uranus @xcite . behaviors belonging to the same class can be found in the dynamics of rolling cylinders immersed in viscous fluids @xcite and in the chaotic response of a damped pendulum parametrically excited @xcite .    from a more applied point of view",
    ", reverse rotations may appear , being potentially deleterious , in bearings of journal machinery @xcite .",
    "they also seem to be relevant in the problem of biological tissue production , where a commonly used method to generate tissue is the rotating vessel bioreactor .",
    "it consists of a cylindrical container rotating about its longitudinal axis with constant angular speed .",
    "a porous disk is seeded with cells to be cultured , placed within the bioreactor which , in turn , is filled with a nutrient - rich medium . the rotating fluid keeps the growing tissue construct suspended against gravity and leads to intricate dynamical regimes .",
    "various studies on the orbits described by the disk exist @xcite .",
    "although this system is not identical to the one we study here , it is clear that a better understanding of the regimes of intrinsic rotation , in the spirit of the present work , is needed .",
    "for example , the existence of a transient between two distinct spinning regimes , like the one we find here , would produce `` topological '' defects in the tissue .    in this work we consider both , driving and friction , simultaneously .",
    "our main goal is to understand how the presence of viscous friction affects the regimes of reverse rotation that have been shown to exist for circularly - driven disks in the non - dissipative case @xcite .",
    "hereafter we refer to the regime where both angular momenta are parallel as normal or prograde .",
    "our model system is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "it consists of a uniform disk of mass @xmath5 and radius @xmath0 , initially resting on a horizontal surface .",
    "the system is submitted to an external horizontal force , provided by a driving mechanism , through a thin rod attached to a fixed point ( @xmath6 ) on the disk , around which the whole body can rotate freely .",
    "the driving apparatus takes the disk from rest and makes the point @xmath6 follow a uniform circular trajectory of radius @xmath7 around a fixed origin ( @xmath8 ) with angular frequency @xmath9 [ see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( a ) ] . for definiteness",
    "we assume the rotation to be counterclockwise and , without loss of generality , we use a coordinate system for which the point @xmath6 lies in the positive @xmath10-axis at @xmath11 .    for later times",
    "we denote the position vector of @xmath6 by @xmath12 and the vector locating the c. m. by @xmath13 .",
    "since the disk is assumed to be perfectly rigid , @xmath6 is always a distance @xmath14 apart from c.m",
    ". the relative position of these two points is given by the vector @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( a ) .",
    "finally , the angle between the @xmath10-axis and the line connecting c.m . and @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the variables @xmath13 and @xmath16 completely specify the position of the disk , while @xmath9 reflects the strength of driving .    in a previous work",
    "the scenario of negligible friction was assumed @xcite .",
    "here we remove this restriction by considering that a thin layer of fluid exists between the disk and the horizontal surface , giving rise to wet friction .",
    "this amounts to viscous forces and torques that are proportional to the local relative velocity between the surfaces .",
    "the overall viscous force acting on the disk is given by the surface integral @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the drag constant and @xmath19 is the vector that locates the element of area @xmath20 [ see fig [ figure2](b ) ]",
    ". taking into account the constraints @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the result reduces to that of a rectilinear , irrotational , motion of the disk : @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , the forces on each element of area give rise to a torque : @xmath24 where @xmath16 is the angle between the vector @xmath15 and the x - axis , and @xmath25 is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of motion . plugging these expressions in newton s second law and eliminating the c. m. degrees of freedom",
    "we get @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the inertia moment relative to the pivotation point @xmath6 . by writing @xmath28",
    "the equation of motion considerably simplifies to @xmath29 where the parameter @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 $ ] , contains all the relevant information on the scale - free geometry of the system , and @xmath33 gives the relative strength of inertia and driving versus viscous forces on the disk .",
    "although in our calculations we will use eq .",
    "( [ eqii ] ) , it is possible to obtain a formally simpler equation by using the dimensionless time @xmath34 , with @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting two - parameter differential equation reads @xmath36 the cost is that @xmath37 is an involved mixture of geometry , inertia , driving and viscosity . from eq .",
    "( [ eqiii ] ) we see that our problem can be mapped into the dynamics of a pendulum immersed in a fluid and subjected to a constant torque @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that a number of quite distinct physical systems are , in some regimes , described by the very equation ( [ eqiii ] ) .",
    "examples are the dynamics of the phase difference between the collective wave functions through a josephson junction @xcite , the excitable behavior of microparticles under the action of an optical torque wrench @xcite , and alternate currents in electrical devices @xcite .",
    "it is , however , important to note two points .",
    "first , the physical quantity we are interested in , which defines reverse or normal rotations , is @xmath16 and not @xmath38 .",
    "second , to completely characterize the problem , we must provide physically valid initial conditions .",
    "in the present case it is natural to assume that , at first , the disk is resting on the horizontal surface , and at a certain instant , say @xmath11 , the driving apparatus is turned on .",
    "if the driving mechanism is robust enough , we can assume that this initial dynamics is impulsive , that is , the pivotation point is taken from rest to the final constant angular velocity in a time interval much shorter than any other time scale in the problem .",
    "under these conditions it has been shown in @xcite that , given the initial angle of the static disk , the angular velocity it acquires immediately after the driving apparatus is switched on is @xmath39 replacing this relation in the equation of motion we also find that @xmath40 . in the original derivation",
    "the friction was not taken into account .",
    "this , however , does not affect the above result due to the hypothesis of impulsivity .    to illustrate the restrictions imposed by the previous relation we remark that the system studied in @xcite",
    "presents the interesting behavior of excitability , namely , the existence of a dynamical regime with sharp spikes in @xmath41 .",
    "the authors observe this phenomenon for a condition that , in our notation , reads @xmath42 with initial condition @xmath43 , and arbitrary @xmath44 .",
    "replacing this condition in ( [ ic ] ) we get @xmath45 , which implies @xmath46 , leading to a negative argument in the square root .",
    "therefore , our system , does not present the excitability observed in @xcite due to the initial conditions we are concerned with .",
    "we start this subsection with a summary of the main conclusions obtained in the frictionless ( @xmath47 ) case @xcite .",
    "it was found that a regime of perennial reverse rotations is possible for an interval of initial angles @xmath48 centered at @xmath49 ( the subscript @xmath50 stands for  boundary \" ) , provided that the geometrical constraint @xmath51 is satisfied .",
    "in fact , it can be derived from eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 11 ) of @xcite that , fixed the angle @xmath52 , the critical value of @xmath53 below which reverse rotations occur can be determined by the solution of the transcendental equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the complete elliptic function of the first kind . for @xmath56 , the only angle leading to reverse dynamics is @xmath57 . in this case",
    "the above equation reduces to @xmath58 , whose non - trivial solution is @xmath59 . for all other situations , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 assumes smaller values . for @xmath62",
    "no initial condition may develop a reverse rotation .",
    "note that this necessary and sufficient condition does not depend on the driving frequency @xmath9 , on the mass @xmath5 and on the absolute values of the lengths @xmath7 , @xmath14 , and @xmath0 .",
    "initial conditions that do not satisfy the previous requirements , either lead to a permanent regime of normal rotations or , in the boundary between the two regimes , to an oscillatory motion with a vanishing average of @xmath16 as time goes by ( see figure 3 of @xcite ) .    in the opposite limit @xmath63 , eq .",
    "( [ eqii ] ) becomes @xmath64 whose fixed points are given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "let us summarize the three qualitatively distinct solutions of this equation @xcite .",
    "( i ) if @xmath67 we have two fixed points in the interval @xmath68 , the stable one having @xmath69 , and no oscillation .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath70 we have a saddle - node bifurcation with no oscillation for any finite time .",
    "( iii ) if @xmath71 there are no fixed points and the system oscillates with a period given by @xmath72 the important point is that , by inspecting eq .",
    "( [ changevar ] ) , we note that , in any case , @xmath73 is an increasing function of time , on average , thus , presenting normal rotations only .    therefore , we conclude that while in the frictionless case reverse rotations may occur , they are forbidden in the high viscosity limit .",
    "the question arises what happens in the midway ?",
    "although a closed analytical solution for our problem with arbitrary viscosity is not available , we can establish the stationary points and their stability properties before going into numerical solutions . by setting @xmath74 and @xmath75 in ( [ eqii ] )",
    "we obtain stable fixed points satisfying @xmath76 with @xmath77 the unstable stationary points are given by @xmath78 .",
    "our numerical investigation for intermediate values of the parameter @xmath79 begins with some typical trajectories in the plane @xmath80 .",
    "we employed the auxiliary variables directly because only in terms of them the equation of motion does not contain time explicitly . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show a phase - space diagram for three initial conditions @xmath81 ( @xmath57 ) for the triangle , @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) for the square , and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) for the circle , with the corresponding initial velocities given by relation ( [ ic ] ) , represented by the dashed line in the diagram .",
    "the other parameters are as follows , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "this leads to @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the horizontal dashed - dotted line represents the negative of the driving angular frequency @xmath9 . recall that , to have a reverse rotation ( @xmath91 over a time scale of @xmath92 )",
    ", we must get @xmath93 over a time scale of @xmath92 .",
    "we note that the first initial condition immediately leads to normal rotation , for the second condition a reverse behavior develops during a single cycle , while the thrid initial condition presents two cycles of reverse rotation before spiraling to the leftmost stable fixed point .",
    "going to the physical variable @xmath16 , the first important thing to note is as follows . for every initial condition that started to develop a reverse rotation , after some time",
    ", the spin invariably flips to a regime of prograde rotation for any @xmath94 .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the oscillations in @xmath73 eventually fade out , with @xmath95 for sufficiently long times , an effect observed in all investigated configurations . when this regime is reached",
    "the equation of motion becomes identical to eq .",
    "( [ blarge ] ) , for which reverse rotations have been shown to be absent . therefore , at some moment reverse dynamics is replaced by normal rotation , the smaller the drag the longer the flip time , @xmath96 , which is determined by the global minimum of @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show @xmath16 as a function of @xmath97 for @xmath98 rad s@xmath99 , and initial condition @xmath57 ( the most favorable to reverse rotations ) .",
    "the first curve ( a ) occurs for @xmath100 ( no reverse motion ) and @xmath101 s@xmath99 .",
    "the three other curves refer to @xmath102 with distinct values of the drag parameter : @xmath103 s@xmath99 ( b ) , @xmath101 s@xmath99 ( c ) , and @xmath104 s@xmath99 ( d ) .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that no steady reverse rotation is allowed for any finite value of @xmath79 .",

    "the life - time of reverse rotations must be null in the limit of high viscosity and has to diverge in the frictionless regime .",
    "dimensional analysis leads us to infer that , if this divergence is described by a power law , then we should have @xmath107 . in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] we record @xmath96 as a function of @xmath79 in a log - log plot .",
    "the discontinuities happen when the global minimum jumps between neighbor local minima .",
    "despite these jumps , a linear backbone is noticeable in a broad range of viscosity values , and a power - law divergence in the low viscosity limit is clear .",
    "the obtained relation is @xmath108 which we found to be asymptotically independent of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the variation of the drag parameter has a much less dramatic effect on the regime of normal rotations , the only difference being the rate at which the amplitude of the oscillations in @xmath73 goes to zero .    in spite of this",
    ", we verified that the initial conditions that lead to reverse rotations in the case of vanishing viscosity are the same that give rise to the reverse transient , the interval @xmath109 being insensitive to the value of @xmath18 .",
    "this is expected due to the impulsive nature of the initial energy input .",
    "in addition , due to relation ( [ powerlaw ] ) we suspected that the dependence of @xmath96 with @xmath110 might be universal with respect to the dimensionless time @xmath111 .",
    "this is indeed the case , as figure [ figure6 ] shows for different values of @xmath79 . in the inset we plot the uncollapsed curves of @xmath96 alone against @xmath110 .",
    "we used a high angular velocity , @xmath112 rad s@xmath99 , in order to suppress oscillations and make the plot clearer . for lower values of @xmath9",
    "the results are qualitatively the same and fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] would represent the envelope of the actual plots .",

    "although perennial reverse rotations are not present for @xmath94 , one may ask which values of @xmath53 allow for transient reverse behavior . in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] we display the maximum value of @xmath53 below which reverse dynamics can occur as a function of @xmath119 , with @xmath57 .",

    "when @xmath110 departs from @xmath49 , both , the values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 tend to decrease . for @xmath126 ,",
    "e.g. , we get @xmath127 and @xmath128 , while @xmath125 considerably drops to 0.40 .",
    "the values of @xmath125 quickly become very restrictive to reverse motion as , for example , @xmath129 , leading to @xmath130 . for @xmath131 , such a condition on @xmath53",
    "would be satisfied only for @xmath132 , hindering in practice the occurrence of reverse rotations .",
    "we , thus , see that increasing wet friction not only decreases the life time of reverse rotations , but also reduces the region in the space of parameters @xmath133 and @xmath134 for which they are possible .",
    "in this work we studied the influence of wet friction in the circularly driven motion of a disk .",
    "we found that the spinning dynamics of the disk is given by a combination ( competition ) between a uniform motion and a pendular motion ( associated with a pendulum immersed in a viscous fluid and acted upon by a constant torque ) , see eq .",
    "[ eqiii ] . while in the frictionless case reverse rotations may exist in steady regimes , for any finite value of viscous damping , this behavior becomes a transient , thus , having a finite life time .",
    "this transient have been completely characterized : ( i ) its life time follows a power law with @xmath135 ; ( ii ) the presence of viscosity reduces the possible geometric configurations that lead to rotations that are initially reverse due to the fall of @xmath61 , according to a q - exponential ; ( iii ) however , the interval of initial conditions @xmath110 that leads to retrograde behavior is insensitive to the value of @xmath18 .",
    "in fact the whole shape of the function @xmath136 is independent of the dragging .",
    "a natural extension of the present work is to consider the analogous situation with coulombian ( dry ) friction .",
    "this leads to a more complex equation of motion involving elliptic functions of intricate arguments and requires a full numerical treatment .    regarding the appearance of a q - exponential ( introduced in the context of statistical physics by tsallis @xcite ) describing the behavior of a critical parameter in a situation that does not explicitly involve statistics",
