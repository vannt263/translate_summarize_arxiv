    "measurements of @xmath4 in semileptonic decays , @xmath5 in @xmath0@xmath1 mixing , and @xmath6 from cp violation in @xmath2@xmath3 and @xmath0@xmath1 mixing have firmly established the existence of a cp - violating phase in the ckm matrix .",
    "the present situation , often referred to as the `` standard analysis '' of the unitarity triangle , is summarized in figure  [ fig : utfit ] .",
    "three comments are in order concerning this analysis :    1 .",
    "the measurements of cp asymmetries in kaon physics ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and @xmath0@xmath1 mixing ( @xmath9 ) probe the imaginary part of @xmath10 and so establish cp violation in the top sector of the ckm matrix .",
    "the standard model predicts that the imaginary part of @xmath10 is related , by three - generation unitarity , to the imaginary part of @xmath11 , and that those two elements are ( to an excellent approximation ) the only sources of cp violation in flavor - changing processes . in order to test this prediction",
    "one must explore the phase @xmath12 in the bottom sector of the ckm matrix .",
    "2 .   with the exception of the @xmath9 measurement the standard analysis",
    "is limited by large theoretical uncertainties , which dominate the widths of the various bands in the figure .",
    "these uncertainties enter via the calculation of hadronic matrix elements . below i will discuss some novel methods to constrain the unitarity triangle using charmless hadronic @xmath0 decays , which are afflicted by smaller hadronic uncertainties and hence provide powerful new tests of the standard model , which can complement the standard analysis .",
    "3 .   with the exception of the measurement of @xmath4 the standard constraints are sensitive to meson  antimeson mixing . mixing amplitudes are of second order in weak interactions and hence might be most susceptible to effects from physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the new constraints on @xmath13 discussed below allow a construction of the unitarity triangle that is over - constrained and independent of @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath2@xmath3 mixing .",
    "it is in this sense complementary to the standard analysis .",
    "the phase @xmath14 can be probed via tree ",
    "penguin interference in decays such as @xmath15 .",
    "experiment shows that amplitude interference is sizable in these decays .",
    "information about @xmath14 can be obtained from measurements of direct cp asymmetries ( @xmath16 ) , but also from the study of cp - averaged branching fractions ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the challenge is , of course , to gain theoretical control over the hadronic physics entering the tree - to - penguin ratios in the various decays .",
    "recently , much progress has been made toward achieving that goal .",
    "hadronic weak decays simplify greatly in the heavy - quark limit @xmath18 .",
    "the underlying physics is that a fast - moving light meson produced by a point - like source ( the effective weak hamiltonian ) decouples from soft qcd interactions @xcite .",
    "a systematic implementation of this color transparency argument is provided by the qcd factorization approach @xcite , which makes rigorous predictions for hadronic @xmath0-decay amplitudes in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "one can hardly overemphasize the importance of controlling nonleptonic decay amplitudes in the heavy - quark limit . while a few years ago reliable calculations of such amplitudes appeared to be out of reach , we are now in a situation where hadronic uncertainties enter only at the level of power corrections suppressed by the heavy @xmath19-quark mass .    in recent work , qcd factorization has been applied to the entire set of the 96 decays of @xmath0 and @xmath20 mesons into @xmath21 or @xmath22 final states ( @xmath23pseudoscalar meson , @xmath24vector meson ) @xcite . it has been demonstrated that the approach correctly reproduces the main features seen in the data , such as the magnitudes of the various tree and penguin amplitudes , and the fact that they have small relative strong - interaction phases . in the future , when more data become available , this will allow us to extract much useful information about the flavor sector of the standard model either from global fits or from analysis of certain classes of decay modes such as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "detailed comparison with the data may also reveal limitations of the heavy - quark expansion in certain modes , perhaps hinting at the significance of some power corrections in @xmath28 .",
    "despite of the success of qcd factorization in describing the data , there is an interest in analyzing ckm parameters using methods that rely as little as possible on an underlying theoretical framework . in this talk",
    "i discuss a method for constructing the unitarity triangle from @xmath0 physics using measurements whose theoretical interpretation is `` clean '' in the sense that it only relies on assumptions that can be tested using experimental data .",
    "i call this construction the cp-@xmath19 triangle , because it probes the existence of a cp - violating phase in the @xmath19 sector of the ckm matrix .",
    "the cp-@xmath19 triangle is over - determined and can be constructed using already existing data .",
    "most importantly , this construction is insensitive to potential new physics effects in @xmath0@xmath1 or @xmath2@xmath3 mixing .",
    "the present analysis is an update of @xcite using the most recent data as of summer 2003 .",
    "the first ingredient is the ratio @xmath29 extracted from semileptonic @xmath0 decays , whose current value is @xmath30 .",
    "several strategies have been proposed to determine @xmath4 with an accuracy of about 10% @xcite , which would be a significant improvement .",
    "the first plot in figure  [ fig : cpt ] shows the corresponding constraint in the @xmath13 plane . here and below the narrow",
    ", dark - colored band shows the theoretical uncertainty , while the lighter band gives the current experimental value .",
    "the second ingredient is a constraint derived from the ratio of the cp - averaged branching fractions for the decays @xmath31 and @xmath32 , using a generalization of the method suggested in @xcite .",
    "the experimental inputs to this analysis are a certain tree - to - penguin ratio @xmath33 and the ratio @xmath34 }     = 0.804\\pm 0.085\\ ] ] of two cp - averaged @xmath25 branching fractions @xcite . without any recourse to qcd factorization",
    "this method provides a bound on @xmath35 , which can be turned into a determination of @xmath35 ( for fixed value of @xmath36 ) when information on the relevant strong - interaction phase @xmath37 is available . the phase @xmath37 is bound by experimental data ( and very general theoretical arguments ) to be small , of order @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "( in the future , this phase can be determined directly from the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath32 decays . )",
    "it is thus conservative to assume that @xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath40 . with this assumption the corresponding allowed region in the @xmath13 plane",
    "was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the resulting constraint is shown in the second plot in figure  [ fig : cpt ] .",
    "the third constraint comes from a measurement of the time - dependent cp asymmetry @xmath41 in @xmath42 decays .",
    "the present experimental situation is still unclear , since the measurements by babar ( @xmath43 ) and belle ( @xmath44 ) are not in good agreement with each other @xcite .",
    "the naive average of these results gives @xmath45 .",
    "( inflating the error according to the pdg prescription would yield @xmath46 , but for some reason the experimenters usually use the naive error without rescaling , and i will follow their example . )",
    "the theoretical expression for the asymmetry is @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the cp - violating phase of the @xmath49@xmath50 mixing amplitude , which in the standard model equals @xmath51 .",
    "usually it is argued that for small @xmath52 ratio the quantity @xmath53 is approximately given by @xmath54 , and so apart from a `` penguin pollution '' the asymmetry @xmath55 . in order to become insensitive to possible new physics contributions to the mixing amplitude",
    "i adopt a different strategy @xcite .",
    "i use the measurement @xmath56 @xcite and write @xmath57 , with a sign ambiguity in the real part .",
    "( the plus sign is suggested by the standard fit of the unitarity triangle . ) a measurement of @xmath58 can then be translated into a constraint on @xmath14 ( or @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , which remains valid even if the @xmath61 measurement is affected by new physics .",
    "the result obtained with the current experimental values and assuming @xmath62 is shown in the third plot in figure  [ fig : cpt ] .",
    "the resulting bands for @xmath63 are obtained by a reflection about the @xmath59 axis .",
    "this follows because the expression for @xmath58 is invariant under the simultaneous replacements @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "each of the three constraints in figure  [ fig : cpt ] are , at present , limited by rather large experimental errors , while comparison with figure  [ fig : utfit ] shows that the theoretical limitations are smaller than for the standard analysis . yet , even at the present level of accuracy it is interesting to combine the three constraints and construct the resulting allowed regions for the apex of the unitarity triangle . the result is shown in the left - hand plot in figure  [ fig : summary ] .",
    "note that the lines corresponding to the new constraints intersect the circles representing the @xmath4 constraint at large angles , indicating that the three measurements used in the construction of the cp-@xmath19 triangle provide highly complementary information on @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "there are six ( partially overlapping ) allowed regions , three corresponding to @xmath62 ( dark shading ) and three to @xmath63 ( light shading ) .",
    "if we use the information that the measured value of @xmath7 requires a positive value of @xmath60 , then only the solutions in the upper half - plane remain .",
    "comparison with figure  [ fig : utfit ] shows that one of these regions ( corresponding to @xmath62 ) is in perfect agreement with the standard fit .",
    "this is highly nontrivial , since with the exception of @xmath4 none of the standard constraints are used in this construction .",
    "interestingly , there is a second allowed region ( corresponding to @xmath63 ) which would be consistent with the constraint from @xmath7 but inconsistent with the constraints derived from @xmath9 and @xmath66 .",
    "such a solution would require a significant new physics contribution to @xmath0@xmath1 mixing .",
