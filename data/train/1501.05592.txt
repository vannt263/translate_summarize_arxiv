    "recent discoveries have underlined a key role of astrophysics in the study of nature . in this paper",
    "we are presenting a potential instrument for measuring high energy photon polarization with a proven detector technique which should allow preparation of a reliable tool for the space - borne observatory .",
    "polarization of the photon has played an important role ( sometimes even before it was recognized ) in physics discoveries such as the famous young s interference experiment  @xcite , michelson - morley s test of the ether theory  @xcite , determination of the neutral pion parity  @xcite and many others , including more recently the spin structure of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) will likely be a crucial observable for the inflation theory ( see planck [ sci.esa.int/planck ] and bicep [ bicepkeck.org ] results ) .    during the last decade ,",
    "observations from the agile [ agile.rm.iasf.cnr.it ] and fermi - lat [ www-glast.stanford.edu ] pair production telescopes have enhanced our understanding of gamma ( @xmath0 ) ray astronomy . with the help of these telescopes numerous high energy @xmath0 ray sources have been observed .",
    "however , the current measurements are insufficient to fully understand the physics mechanism of such @xmath0 ray sources as gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , blazars , pulsars , and supernova remnants ( snrs ) . even though both telescopes cover a wide range of energy ( from 20  mev to more than 300  gev ) , neither of them is capable of polarization measurements .",
    "medium to high energy photon polarimeters for astrophysics were proposed by the nasa group  @xcite and recently by the saclay group  @xcite .",
    "both are considering ar(xe)-based gas - filled detectors : the time projection chamber with a micro - well or micromega section for amplification of ionization .",
    "in this paper we evaluate the features of an electron - positron pair polarimeter for the full energy range from 20  mev to 1000  mev and then propose a specific design for a polarimeter in the 100 to 300  mev energy range using silicon micro - strip detectors , msds , whose principal advantage with respect to the gas - based tpc is that the spatial and two - track resolution is about five to ten times better .    the paper is organized in the following way : in section  [ sec_moti ] we briefly discuss the motivation for cosmic @xmath0 ray polarimetry in the high energy region .",
    "section [ sec_pol ] is devoted to measurement techniques , polarimeters being built and current proposals . in section [ sec_flux ]",
    "we calculate the photon flux coming from the crab pulsar and crab nebula .",
    "the design of the new polarimeter and its performance are discussed in the last few sections .",
    "there are several recent reviews of photon polarimetry in astrophysics  @xcite which address many questions which we just briefly touch on in this section .",
    "photon polarimetry for energy below a few  mev is a very active field of astrophysical research , and some examples of the productive use of polarimetry at these energies include : detection of exoplanets , analysis of chemical composition of planetary atmosphere , and investigation of interstellar matter , quasar jets and solar flares .",
    "however , no polarization measurements are available in the medium and high energy regions because of the instrumental challenges .",
    "the primary motivation in proposing a polarimeter is our interest in understanding the emission and production mechanisms for polarized @xmath0 rays in pulsars , grbs , and agns by measuring polarization of cosmic @xmath0 rays in this under - explored energy region ( @xmath1  @xmath2  mev ) .",
    "additionally , the polarization observations from the rotation - powered and accretion - powered pulsar radiation mechanisms could help to confirm the identification of black hole candidates  @xcite .",
    "polarization measurements could reveal one of the possible effects induced by quantum gravity , the presence of small , but potentially detectable , lorentz or cpt violating terms in the effective field theory .",
    "these terms lead to a macroscopic birefringence effect of the vacuum ( see  @xcite for more information ) .",
    "up to now , the highest energy linear polarization measurement has been for grb 061122 in the 250 - 800  kev energy range  @xcite , and vacuum birefringence has not been observed in that region .",
    "therefore , extending polarization sensitivity to higher energies could lead to detection of vacuum birefringence , which would have an extraordinary impact on fundamental physics , or in the case of null detection we could significantly improve the present limits on the lorentz invariance violation parameter .",
    "further , according to the observations by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) [ heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cgro/egret ] , the synchrotron emission of the crab nebula is significant in the energy below @xmath3  200  mev  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the theoretical studies state that most of the @xmath0 rays coming from the crab nebula around 100  mev may come from its inner knot  @xcite , so the observations in the neighborhood of 100  mev will help to test this theoretical hypothesis and confirm the emission mechanism .",
    "furthermore , the observation of the @xmath0 rays from the crab pulsar provides strong evidence of the location of the @xmath0 ray emitting region as it lies in the center of the nebula .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that polarimetry could test the theories assuming existence of axions ( hypothetical particles introduced to solve the strong cp problem of qcd ) .",
    "it is interesting that the same axions or axion - like particles can serve as a foundation for a relevant mechanism of sun luminosity @xcite .",
    "a theoretical study  @xcite has shown that polarization observations from grbs can be used to constrain the axion - photon coupling : @xmath4 for the axion mass @xmath5  ev .",
    "the limit of the coupling scales is @xmath6 ; therefore , the polarimetry of grbs at higher energies would lead to tighter constraints .    in two of the following subsections",
    "we will briefly explain how polarization measurements are involved in confirming the emission mechanism and geometry of two above - mentioned sources .",
    "pulsars are a type of neutron star , yet they are highly magnetized and rotate at enormous speeds .",
    "the questions concerning the way magnetic and electric fields are oriented , how particles are accelerated and how the energy is converted into radio and @xmath0 rays in pulsars are still not fully answered .",
    "because of the extreme conditions in pulsars interiors , they can be used to understand poorly known properties of superdense , strongly magnetized , and superconducting matter  @xcite . moreover , by studying pulsars one can learn about the nuclear reactions and interactions between the elementary particles under these conditions , which can not be reproduced in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "particle acceleration in the polar region of the magnetic field results in gamma radiation , which is expected to have a high degree of polarization  @xcite .",
    "depending on the place where the radiation occurs , the pulsar emission can be explained in the framework of a polar cap model or an outer cap model . in both models ,",
    "the emission mechanism is similar , but polarization is expected to be dissimilar  @xcite ; hence , polarimetry could be used to understand the pulsar s emission mechanism .",
    "polarization measurements would also help to understand grbs .",
    "the grbs @xcite are short and extremely bright bursts of @xmath0 rays .",
    "usually , a short - time ( from @xmath5  s to about @xmath7  s ) peak of radiation is followed by a long lasting afterglow .",
    "the characteristics of the radiation emitted during the short - time peak and during the afterglow are different .",
    "the number of high - energy photons which may be detected during the short - time burst phase is expected to be small compared with the one for the long - lived emission .",
    "while only about 3% of the energy emitted during the short - time burst is carried by high - energy photons with @xmath8  mev , the high energy photons of the afterglow carry about half of the total emitted energy . therefore , there is a possibility of observing polarization of high energy photons during the afterglow .",
    "the emission mechanism of grbs , the magnetic composition , and the geometry and morphology of grb jets are still uncertain but can be at least partly revealed in this way .",
    "it is worth noting that several studies have discussed how the degree of polarization , @xmath9 , depends on the grb emission mechanisms . in one example , using monte carlo methods toma @xmath10  @xcite showed that the compton drag model is favored when the degree of polarization @xmath9@xmath11@xmath12 , and @xmath13-@xmath14 concerns the synchrotron radiation with the ordered magnetic fields model .",
    "moreover , studies by mundell @xmath10  @xcite and lyutikov @xmath10  @xcite have proven that polarimetry could assist in revealing the geometry of grb jets .",
    "several physical processes such as the photoelectric effect , thomson scattering , compton scattering , and electron - positron pair production can be used to measure photon linear polarization .",
    "polarimeters based on the photoelectric effect and thomson scattering are used at very low energies .",
    "compton polarimeters are commonly used for energies from 50  kev to a few mev  @xcite . ) above an energy range of a few mev . ]",
    "some of the major achievements in astrophysics that were obtained using polarimetry are : the discovery of synchrotron radiation from the crab nebula  @xcite ; the study of the surface composition of solar system objects  @xcite ; the measurement of the x - ray linear polarization of the crab nebula  @xcite , which is still one of the best measurements of linear polarization for astrophysical sources ; mapping of solar and stellar magnetic fields  @xcite ; detection of polarization in the cmb radiation  @xcite ; and analysis of large scale galactic magnetic fields  @xcite .    the measurement of polarization in this high energy @xmath0 ray regime can be done by detecting the electron - positron pairs produced by @xmath0 rays and analysis of a non - uniformaty of event distribution in the electron - positron pair plane angle , as discussed in ref .",
    "however , implementation of this technique should consider limitations due to multiple coulomb scatterings in the detector , and there are no successful polarization measurements for astrophysical sources in the energy regime of interest in our paper .    a number of missions have included cosmic @xmath0 ray observations , but only a few of them are capable of measuring polarization .",
    "the polarimetry measurements were mainly restricted to @xmath0 rays with low energies e @xmath15 10  mev . as an example",
    ", the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) [ hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3 ] , launched to image the sun at energies from 3  kev to 20  mev , was capable of polarimetry up to 2  mev , and the results were successfully used to study the polarization of numerous solar flares  @xcite .",
    "the spi detector international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) instrument [ sci.esa.int/integral ] has the capability of detecting polarization in the range of 3  kev to 8  mev  @xcite .",
    "it was used to measure the polarization of grb 041219a , and later a high degree of polarization of @xmath0 rays from that source  @xcite was confirmed .",
    "the tracking and imaging gamma ray experiment ( tigre ) compton telescope , which observes @xmath0 rays in the range of @xmath16 ",
    "@xmath17  mev , can measure polarization up to 2  mev .    recently ,",
    "morselli @xmath10 proposed gamma - light to detect @xmath0 rays in the energy range 10  mev  10  gev ,",
    "and they believe that it will provide solutions to all the current issues that could not be resolved by agile and fermi - lat in the energy range 10  200  mev .",
    "it can also determine the polarization for intense sources for the energies above a few hundred mev with high accuracy  @xcite .",
    "in spite of the limitations of the instruments capability , there are numerous polarimetry studies in @xmath0 ray astrophysics , and various proposals have been put forth regarding medium and high energy @xmath0 ray polarimeters .",
    "for example , bloser @xmath10  @xcite proposed the advanced pair telescope ( apt ) , also a polarimeter , in the @xmath3  50  mev  1  gev range . that proposal uses a gas - based time projection chamber ( tpc ) with micro - well amplification to track the @xmath18 , @xmath19 path .",
    "the polarization sensitivity was estimated by using geant4 monte carlo simulations .",
    "preliminary results indicated that it will be capable of detecting linearly polarized emissions from bright sources at 100  mev .",
    "as an updated version of the apt , hunter @xmath10",
    "@xcite suggested the advanced energetic pair telescope ( adept ) for @xmath0 ray polarimetry in the medium energy range ; further , they mentioned that it would also provide better photon angular resolution than fermi - lat in the range of @xmath3  5 to @xmath3  200  mev .",
    "harpo is a hermetic argon tpc detector proposed by bernard @xmath10  @xcite which would have high angular resolution and would be sensitive to polarization of @xmath0 rays with energies in the mev - gev range .",
    "a demonstrator for this tpc was built , and preliminary estimates of the spatial resolution are encouraging .",
    "currently , the harpo team is finalizing a demonstrator set up to characterize a beam of polarized @xmath0 rays in the energy range of 2  76  mev  @xcite .",
    "observations of the @xmath0 rays from the crab pulsar and crab nebula have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for eight months of survey data with fermi - lat .",
    "the pulsar dominates the phase - averaged photon flux , but there is an off - pulse window ( 35% of the total duration of the cycle ) when the pulsar flux is negligible and it is therefore possible to observe the nebular emission . according to the conducted analysis , the spectrum of the crab nebula in the @xmath17-@xmath20  mev range can be described by the following combined expression : @xmath21 where the quantity @xmath22 is measured in @xmath23 representing the number of photons reaching @xmath24  @xmath25 of the detector area per second , per @xmath24  mev of energy .",
    "the energy @xmath26 on the right hand side is measured in gev .",
    "the prefactors @xmath27 and @xmath28 are determined by 35% of the total duration of the cycle , while @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the first and second terms on the right hand side , as well as the indices `` sync '' and `` ic '' , correspond to the synchrotron and inverse compton components of the spectrum , respectively . as one can see , these terms have different dependence on the energy @xmath26 since they represent different contributions to the total spectrum . the first part ( the synchrotron radiation )",
    "comes from emission by high energy electrons in the nebular magnetic field while the second part is due to the inverse compton scattering of the primary accelerated electrons .    for convenience",
    "let us rewrite the expression for the spectrum of the crab nebula in the form @xmath31 where the energy @xmath26 on both sides is now measured in mev , so @xmath32 and @xmath33 . integrating @xmath22 , for the photon flux above @xmath17  mev coming from the crab nebula we obtain the number @xmath34 giving for the total cycle duration @xmath35 , or @xmath36 .",
    "at the same time the averaged spectrum of the crab pulsar is described in @xcite as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the cut - off energy @xmath40 .",
    "as before , the energy @xmath26 on both sides is measured in mev . integrating this expression , for the photon flux above @xmath17  mev coming from the crab pulsar we obtain the number @xmath41 , or @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the pulsar s photon flux is twice as intensive as the nebula s",
    ". a fast photometer could be insert in the polarimeter instrumentation to collect events and have a temporal tag and consequently distinguish between nebula and pulsar photons , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we will use the numbers above for an estimation of the polarimeter results at a 100  mev energy cut .",
    "for a 500  mev cut the statistics drops by a factor of five ( because @xmath43 is much higher the exponential factor does not play a role ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the estimates following from @xcite approximately agree with the corresponding estimates made in @xcite ( where the formulas ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) describe the synchrotron and inverse compton components of the crab nebula spectrum while the formula ( 3 ) describes the averaged crab pulsar spectrum ) .",
    "really , according to @xcite , the total crab nebula photon flux above @xmath17  mev is @xmath44 , while for the crab pulsar the value again reads @xmath45 .",
    "the photo production of an electron - positron pair in the field of nuclei is a well understood process which was calculated in qed with all details including the effect of photon linear polarization , see e.g. ref .",
    "the kinematics and variables of the reactions are shown in fig .",

    "was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the practical design and the test of the polarimeter for a beam of high energy photons were reported in ref .",
    "there we detected both particles of the pair and reconstructed the azimuthal angle of the pair plane @xmath51 ( see fig .",

    "the analyzing power , averaged over energy sharing between electron and positron and pair open angle of the experimental acceptance , has been found to be 0.116@xmath570.002 , comparable to a 0.14 value as shown in fig .",

    "when the pair components move through the converter , the azimuthal angle built on pair coordinates and pair vertex becomes blurred due to multiple scattering .",
    "it is useful to note that the purpose of development in ref .",
    "@xcite was a polarimeter for an intense photon beam .",
    "the thickness of the converter in the beam polarimeter was chosen to be very small to minimize systematics of the measurement of the photon polarization degree .",
    "however , the polarimeter could be calibrated by using the highly polarized photon beams produced in the laser - backscattering facilities . for the cosmic ray polarimeter",
    ", we propose a larger converter thickness and calibration of the device .",
    "such an approach is more productive for cosmic rays studies where a relative systematic error on the polarization degree at the level of 3 - 5% is acceptable .",
    "let us also note that for the photon beam polarimetry there are additional options such as a coherent pair production in an oriented crystal and a magnetic separation of the pair components used many years ago in nuclear physics experiments .",
    "for the space - borne photon investigation , those polarimeters are not applicable for the obvious reasons of the limited angle range for the coherent effects and the large weight and power consumption of the magnetic system .",
    "an active converter with a coordinate resolution of a few microns would allow us to construct a dream device , a very efficient polarimeter .",
    "a real world active - converter device , a gas - filled tpc , has a spatial resolution of 100  @xmath58 m and much larger two - track resolution of 1.5 - 2  mm ( for a few cm long drift distance ) .",
    "such a polarimeter will be a very productive instrument for the photon energy range below 50  mev .",
    "however , because of these resolutions , it would be hard to measure the degree of polarization of photons whose energy is bigger than 100  mev .",
    "a polarimeter with separation of the converter and pair detector functions could benefit from the high coordinate resolution of the silicon msd of 10 - 15  @xmath58 m , its two - track resolution of 0.2  mm , and flexibility for the distance between a converter and pair hits detector : between them would be a vacuum gap .",
    "the key parameters of the polarimeter are the efficiency , @xmath59 , and analyzing power , @xmath48 . here",
    "we outline the analysis of the figure - of - merit , @xmath60 .",
    "we will consider a polarimeter as a stack of individual flat cells , each of which is comprised of a converter with a two - dimensional coordinate readout and a coordinate detector for two - track events with no material between them .",
    "the thickness of the converter , where the photon produces the electron - positron pair , defines in the first approximation the polarimeter efficiency as follows : @xmath61 the efficiency of one cell is @xmath62 with @xmath63 is the thickness of the converter in units of radiation length .",

    "we used a geant3-based mc code to study the photon detection efficiency and electron - positron pair azimuthal distribution in a wide range of the converter thickness up to 10% of radiation length . because both the pair opening angle and multiple scattering are scaled with the photon energy , the distributions are almost energy independent .",
    "we present first the results for the 100  mev photon energy for different thicknesses of the converter at a fixed distance of 20  mm between the converter end and the detector .",
    "we used a standard geant3 pair production generator for the unpolarized photons and at the conversion point introduced a weighting factor for each event as @xmath77 to simulate a polarization effect on an event - by - event basis .",

    "<S> our study supported by a monte carlo simulation shows that with a one - year observation period the polarimeter will provide 6% accuracy of the polarization degree for a photon energy of 100  mev , which would be a significant advance relative to the currently explored energy range of a few mev . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed polarimeter design could easily be adjusted to the specific photon energy range to maximize efficiency if needed . </S>"
