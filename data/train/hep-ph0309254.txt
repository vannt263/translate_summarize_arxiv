    "the currently known fermions consist of quarks @xmath13 with charge @xmath14 , quarks @xmath15 with charge @xmath0 , leptons @xmath16 with charge @xmath17 , and neutrinos @xmath18 with charge @xmath19 . in the standard model ( sm ) , these fermions are arranged into structures that transform under the gauge group su(3)@xmath20su(2)@xmath21u(1)@xmath22 . however",
    ", a deeper understanding of the particle spectrum and its pattern of charge - changing weak transitions is still unknown .",
    "one may try to understand the fermion spectrum and couplings by embedding the standard model in a larger gauge group .",
    "for example , unified theories of the electroweak and strong interactions based on the group so(10 )  @xcite can accommodate precisely this set of fermions within three 16-dimensional spinor representations .",
    "larger unified groups , like e@xmath23  @xcite , not only contain the standard model fermions but also predict the existence of new particles .",
    "the discovery of new particles predicted by higher dimensional gauge theories would provide insight on the organization of matter into a fundamental theory .",
    "a unified theory based on the gauge group e@xmath23  is phenomenologically interesting because it includes an enlarged lepton sector containing both massive and sterile neutrinos , an enlarged quark sector containing charge @xmath0 isosinglet vector - like quarks ( isvlq ) , and additional gauge bosons ( e.g. z@xmath24 ) @xcite . for additional information on building low - energy models from the gauge group @xmath25 ,",

    ", we study weak isosinglet vector - like quarks with charge @xmath0 .",
    "pair production of isvlqs at high - energy hadron colliders is expected to be dominated by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and thus to be precisely calculable .",
    "the decays of these particles depend on their mixing with sm down - type quarks  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the prospects for producing and detecting these exotic quarks at the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "in particular , we consider both charged - current ( mediated by @xmath26 bosons ) and flavor - changing neutral - current ( mediated by @xmath27 and higgs bosons ) decays of the isosinglet vector - like quark .",
    "the sensitivity of these estimates to assumptions about mixing between exotic quarks and those of the standard model is explored .",
    "related earlier studies have appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we review relevant properties of the exotic quarks , and we introduce a model for their mixing with ordinary quarks . in section  [ sec : constraints ] , we briefly review constraints on the new mixing parameters . based on these constraints , we propose a phenomenological parametrization of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "signals at the fermilab tevatron and the cern lhc are treated in sections  [ sec : pandd ] and  [ sec : panddlhc ] , respectively , while section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "in a unified electroweak theory based on the e@xmath23  gauge group , the fundamental ( @xmath28-dimensional ) representation contains additional quarks with charge @xmath0 and additional charged and neutral leptons .",
    "the exotic matter content of a single e@xmath23  family is summarized in table  [ tab:27plet ] @xcite .",
    "we assume that there are three @xmath28-plets , corresponding to the three lepton - quark families .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for most of the signatures discussed in section  [ subsec : signatures ] , the sm background appears to be manageable when compared to the signal cross sections [ see table  [ tab : signal ] ] .",
    "the notable exceptions are the @xmath29 and the @xmath30 signatures .",
    "the large backgrounds for these signatures ( relative to the other signatures ) can be traced to top quark pair production . at the tevatron , @xmath31 production , like the @xmath32 production ,",
    "proceeds via quark / anti - quark annihilation and gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "once the @xmath31 are produced , each top quark decays to a @xmath33 and a @xmath34 .",
    "subsequent decay of the @xmath35 bosons results in the following three signatures : `` @xmath36 '' ( full - jets ) , `` @xmath37 '' ( semi - leptonic ) , and `` @xmath38 '' ( fully leptonic ) .",
    "we use the ` @xmath39 ' notation to indicate that the quantities enclosed in the parentheses have an invariant mass equal to the @xmath35 boson mass .",
    "if the dijet mass resolution at the tevatron were _ perfect",
    "_ , then a jet pair from a @xmath35 decay and a jet pair from a @xmath40 decay would always be distinguishable .",
    "however , the dijet mass resolution at the tevatron is _ not _ perfect ; therefore , a fraction of the @xmath31 events decaying to the full - jets mode will mimic the @xmath29 signature .",
    "we find that for a higgs mass of @xmath41 gev / c@xmath42 and an @xmath11 quark mass of @xmath43 gev / c@xmath42 , the background to the signature @xmath29 is @xmath44 fb . the purely qcd component of this background ( denoted `` 0 '' in table  [ tab : bkgrnd ] ) was not calculated .",
    "though one expects the invariant mass cuts to substantially reduce this background , it is unlikely that it will be negligible .",
    "thus we conclude that the @xmath29 signature is background limited and that other @xmath32 signatures will provide a better @xmath11 quark mass reach .",
    "however , if nature contains an @xmath11 quark with a mass less than @xmath45 gev / c@xmath42 , this signature will provide a channel to measure the mass of the @xmath11 quark ( @xmath11 quark mass peak ) .",
    "the @xmath30 signature also has a sizable @xmath31 background component .",
    "when a @xmath31 event decays to the fully leptonic mode , the invariant mass of the two charged leptons _ may _ be close to the mass of the @xmath46 boson .",
    "one concludes that , like the @xmath29 signature , the @xmath11 quark mass reach of the @xmath30 signature is diminished because of the background .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath48 signatures provide clean alternatives to the full jets signature . unlike the @xmath29 signature , the @xmath49 signature is not afflicted by a large @xmath31 background .",
    "the semi - leptonic decay of a @xmath31 event can duplicate the @xmath49 signature if the dijet mass is close to the @xmath46 mass and the charged lepton is undetected . in table",
    "[ tab : bkgrnd ] , we include this and other backgrounds to the @xmath49 signature in which a charged lepton from the decay of a @xmath35 is undetected . in order to determine the `` undetected lepton '' background , we assume that this background originates from events in which the charged lepton travels through an uninstrumented region of the detector  @xcite . the `` lost - lepton '' background is also included in the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 signatures .",
    "though other experimental issues , like jet energy mismeasurement of qcd jets , are likely to increase the background , we do not include these in our calculation .",
    "the @xmath47 signature also avoids large @xmath31 backgrounds",
    ". the semi - leptonic decay of a @xmath31 event can mimic this signature if the dijet mass is @xmath46-like and the detector spuriously identifies an additional lepton .",
    "the dilepton mass of the real and spurious charged leptons must be @xmath46-like .",
    "this component of the background is expected to be small ; therefore , we do not include it in the background estimate .    since the @xmath47 and the @xmath53 are clean signatures with small backgrounds , we expect these modes to provide the greatest reach at the tevatron . in ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) fb@xmath54 of data , the highest @xmath11 quark mass accessible by the @xmath55 and the @xmath56 signatures are ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) gev / c@xmath42 and ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) gev / c@xmath42 , respectively .",
    "while the @xmath59 mode is likely to provide the best reach for an @xmath11 quark search , the @xmath60 mode provides an opportunity to discover the higgs boson in conjunction with the @xmath11 quark . if nature favors a light higgs boson ( _ e.g. _ @xmath61 gev / c@xmath42 ) , the dominant branching ratio of the higgs boson is the @xmath62 mode , @xmath63% .",
    "however , if the mass of the higgs boson is larger than current electroweak best fits  @xcite , the @xmath64 mode is less powerful .",
    "for example , at a higgs mass of @xmath41 gev / c@xmath42 , the higgs branching ratio to @xmath62 is @xmath65% .",
    "unlike many of the @xmath59 signatures , the @xmath60 signatures do _ not _ suffer from the large @xmath31 background .",
    "the reduction in the @xmath31 background is primarily because of the @xmath62 signature from the higgs decay ( @xmath35 can not decay to a @xmath62 pair ) .",
    "though these signatures have low sm backgrounds , @xmath33-tagging efficiencies will reduce the expected signal cross section .",
    "standard model background to each of the three @xmath66 signatures is small [ see table  [ tab : bkgrnd ] ] . because of computational limitations ,",
    "the pure qcd component of the @xmath67 background ( denoted `` 0 '' in table  [ tab : bkgrnd ] ) was not calculated .",
    "as with the background for the @xmath68 signature , the qcd component of the @xmath67 signature will need to be measured from the data .",
    "it is unlikely that the background from these processes will be large . assuming a @xmath33-tagging efficiency of @xmath69% and requiring that three of the four @xmath33-jets is tagged , for a higgs mass of @xmath70 gev / c@xmath42 one expects the mass reach in the @xmath71 to be ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) gev / c@xmath42 in ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) fb@xmath54 of data .",
    "moreover , because the background to the @xmath72 signature is not expected to be large , we expect for a higgs mass of @xmath70 gev / c@xmath42 the @xmath11 mass reach of this mode to be @xmath73 ( @xmath74 , @xmath4 ) gev / c@xmath42 .",
    "at the cm energy of the cern lhc ( @xmath75 tev ) , @xmath32 pair production is dominated by the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess .",
    "contributions from subprocesses in which a valence quark from one proton and its anti - particle from the other proton ( sea quark ) annihilate via the strong interactions are important but sub - dominate to the gluon - gluon fusion .    for the lhc we consider the same primary decay channels of the @xmath32 pair as at the tevatron : @xmath76 , @xmath59 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath60 , and @xmath79 .",
    "we also impose the same set of loose cuts on the primary decay products of the @xmath11 quark [ see table  [ tab : tevcuts ] ] .",
    "this ensures that @xmath33 quarks produced from the primary decay of the @xmath32 pair conform to _ basic _ geometry and event selection requirements of the detectors .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath32 production and ( primary @xmath11 quark ) decay at the lhc are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : xseclhc ] . in this figure , the new mixing parameter , @xmath80 ,",
    "is set to @xmath7 , the higgs mass , @xmath81 , is set to @xmath41 gev / c@xmath42 , and the @xmath11 quark mass , @xmath82 , runs from @xmath3  @xmath83 gev / c@xmath42 .",
    "the cross sections for the @xmath32 primary decay modes at the lhc are roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding cross sections at the tevatron .",
    "below @xmath84 gev / c@xmath42 , the @xmath59 mode is once again the dominant primary decay mode of @xmath32 pair production . above an @xmath11 quark mass of @xmath84 gev / c@xmath42 ,",

    "the higgs mass is @xmath85 gev / c@xmath42 , the new mixing parameter @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . ]    at the lhc the cross sections for each of the three charged - current primary decay modes are significant , unlike those at the tevatron . for an @xmath11 quark mass of @xmath88 gev / c@xmath42 and a mixing parameter @xmath89",
    ", the lhc should produce @xmath90 @xmath32 events decaying to the @xmath76 mode in @xmath3 fb@xmath54 of data .",
    "the charged - current mode of @xmath32 decay is important because our parametrization of the @xmath91@xmath92(ckm ) matrix in the isvlq model predicts a relationship between the size of charged - current and neutral - current interactions . as discussed in section  [ subsec : backgrounds ] , the charged - current modes have final states that are more complicated than those encountered in fcnc decay modes .",
    "additional complications are attributed to the decay of the top quark resulting in an additional @xmath35 boson . with additional particles in the final state , dijet mass resolution and the calculation of signature backgrounds",
    "are extremely important components for an analysis . rather than address the charged - current modes in this paper",
    ", we defer this analysis to future research when the difficulties of the background calculation and details about dijet mass resolution and @xmath33-tagging can be better resolved .    in our analysis of @xmath32 production at the tevatron",
    "[ see section  [ subsec : panddtev ] ] , we found that signatures of the @xmath59 mode provide the highest @xmath11 quark mass reach .",
    "we conclude that in @xmath8 fb@xmath54 of data , @xmath32 pair production can be probed up to an @xmath11 quark mass of @xmath5 gev / c@xmath42 . at this @xmath11 quark mass and for a higgs mass of @xmath41 gev / c@xmath42 ,",
    "the cross section to the @xmath59 mode ( @xmath93 fb ) and the branching ratio to the `` optimal '' signatures combine to produce a handful of signal events with negligible background .",
    "based on our study of the @xmath94 mode at the tevatron , we infer a mass reach for this decay mode at the lhc .",
    "we assume that the branching ratios of the @xmath59 mode to _ final - state _ signatures and the detection of these signatures at the lhc are similar to the tevatron .",
    "therefore , at the lhc , the upper limit on the @xmath11 quark mass is encountered when approximately @xmath95 events are produced in the @xmath59 mode .",
    "the expected integrated luminosity at the lhc is @xmath3 fb@xmath54 ; thus one can probe the @xmath59 cross section down to @xmath96 fb .",
    "this corresponds to an @xmath11 quark mass reach of @xmath12 gev / c@xmath42 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : xseclhc ] ] .",
    "we have investigated an @xmath25-inspired extension of the standard model in which an exotic charge @xmath0 isosinglet vector - like quark ( denoted @xmath11 ) interacts predominantly with the third generation of quarks . in this model ,",
    "the ckm matrix is no longer unitary and it is replaced by a @xmath97 matrix containing new angles and phases .",
    "the loss of ckm unitarity is accompanied by the emergence of _ tree - level _ flavor - changing neutral currents mediated by both @xmath40 and @xmath98 bosons .",
    "flavor - changing neutral - current interactions between the @xmath11 quark and the @xmath33 quark produce signatures of @xmath32 production accessible for detection at hadron colliders .    at the fermilab tevatron , we find that @xmath11 quark discovery through pair production is accessible up to an @xmath11 quark mass of ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) gev / c@xmath42 in ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) fb@xmath54 of data .",
