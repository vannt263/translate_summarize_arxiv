    "we consider the problem of ising spin systems on a family of fractals with a zero temperature fixed point .",
    "more especially , we consider the case of a hierarchical lattice , the regular simplex ( regular fractals ) , and bidimensional percolation clusters at the percolation threshold .",
    "this problem has its origin in the pioner work of mandelbrot @xcite .",
    "the problem is also of an experimental interest because of the existence of random magnets with a fractal structure ( see for instance @xcite ) . as a byproduct , we derive a measure of the ramification order of percolating clusters .",
    "to do so , we compare to cross - over temperatures : 1 ) the glass cross - over temperature @xmath8 2 ) the magnetization distribution cross - over temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the dominant behavior of the glass cross - over temperature was discovered in the 80 s @xcite @xcite .",
    "this quantity is related to the correlation length of the magnet . below @xmath8 ,",
    "the correlation length is larger than the system size , leading to a linear regime of the logarithm of the relaxation time as a function of the inverse temperature . above @xmath8 ,",
    "the correlation length is smaller than the linear size of the cluster , leading to a parabolic behavior for the logarithm of the relaxation time as a function of the inverse temperature .",
    "this behavior is well established on a numerical basis @xcite .",
    "the second cross - over temperature @xmath4 was not much studied in the past .",
    "below @xmath4 [ which is inverse proportional to the logarithm of the number of sites ] , the magnetization distribution is non gaussian .",
    "these non gaussian magnetization distributions also accur on the ferromagnetic cayley tree @xcite , however with a different decay with the system size . more surprising",
    "is the appearance of similar magnetization distributions in magnetized spin glasses @xcite .",
    "however , in real spin glasses , this non gaussian magnetization distribution is not expected to vanish in the thermodynamic limit as it is the case on ferromagnetic systems .",
    "we first study the case of regular fractals ( a hierarchical lattice and the regular simplex ) .",
    "we use the swendsen algorithm to generate equilibrium states @xcite , and thus to calculate the magnetization distributions . in the case of the regular simplex , it is possible to determine the geometric origin of the different local maxima of the magnetization distribution at low temperatures . in section [ general ] ,",
    "we make a general argument to estimate the magnetization distribution cross - over scale , which is shown to be inverse proportional to the number of sites , and proportional to the ramification order @xmath9 . in the case of percolating clusters ,",
    "we calculate the magnetization distribution at low temperature . averaging over the geometry",
    ", we can see the existence of finite size effects : the spin system is more ferromagnetic if one lowers the number of generations .",
    "we also studied the correlation between different equilibrium states , which gives us an other way to estimate @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we calculate the ration @xmath10 , which yields an estimation of the ramification order of bidimensional percolation clusters .",
    "we end up with some concluding remarks .",
    "the interest of hierarchical lattices is that the thermodynamics of the ising model is exactly soluble on these structures .",
    "we consider the case of the hierarchical lattice built with the rules of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the coordination of every site is bounded above , which is not always the case for hierarchical lattices ( for instance for the hierarchical diamond , in which case the coordination diverges in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "the number of sites of the hierarchical lattice of figure [ fig1 ] is @xmath11 , whereas the end to end distance is @xmath12 , leading to the fractal dimension @xmath13 .",
    "an interesting aspect of hierarchical lattices is that their yang and lee zero can be calculated easily in the temperature plane .",
    "this was done in @xcite in the case of the hierarchical diamond .",
    "the yang and lee zeros set is a julia set . for comparison with the results of @xcite",
    ", we also calculate the yang and lee zeros of our hierarchical lattice .",
    "first , we need to derive recursion relations for the partition function .",
    "the technique ( standard for hierarchical lattices ) consists in carrying out the trace over the the spin variables at the smallest scales , and to derive the renormalization of the temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the partition function of the hierarchical lattice with one generation is @xmath14 where the spins are pictured on figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to @xmath15 the partition function @xmath16 can be rewritten under the form @xmath17 we have introduced here three parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for three distinct partition functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the partition function can thus be consistently be brought under the form ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the identification of ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) leads to @xmath24 in the case of a zero magnetic field , we obtain @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the renormalization equation ( [ eq3 ] ) has only one fixed point : @xmath28 , so that the spin system is always disordered at any finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we now calculate the yang and lee zeros in the temperature plane .",
    "this is not the main subject of this paper , but it is interesting to compare with existing results on the hierarchical diamond , where the yang and lee zero in the temperature plane form a julia set @xcite .",
    "we work in the plane of the variable @xmath29 and invert the relation ( [ eq3 ] ) , which leads to a polynomial of degree @xmath30 : @xmath31 if @xmath32 is a solution of ( [ eq4 ] ) , @xmath33 is a solution too , so that the set of zeros of the partition function is invariant under the inversion @xmath34 . in order to compute the set of zeros of the partition function , we use the methods of @xcite , that is we start from a given point in the complex plane , we calculate the zeros of ( [ eq3 ] ) , choose one solution among the six zeros at random , and reiterate . the zeros are computed using a laguerre s method @xcite .",
    "the resulting set is independent on the initial value of @xmath32 , as far as one eliminates the first zeros .",
    "the result is plotted on figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the set of zeros are concentrated on lines , which intersect the real axis in the vicinity of the point @xmath35 .",
    "a zoom in the vicinity of @xmath35 reveals that the density of zeros vanishes as one approaches the origin ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "contrary to the case of the hierarchical diamond , the lee and yang zeros are concentrated on lines in the @xmath29 plane , whereas the julia set of the hierarchical diamond is a fractal .",
    "the glass temperature cross - over @xmath8 is related to the decay of the correlation function from one end of the fractal to the other @xcite @xcite @xcite . since the ising model is soluble on the hierarchical lattice , it is easy to get the behavior of the correlation length between the extremal sites as a function of the number @xmath2 of iterations and the temperature .",
    "we call @xmath36 the dimensionless inverse temperature @xmath37 . in the low temperature regime , we get from equation ( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the value of @xmath36 after @xmath2 renormalization steps . in the low temperature regime , @xmath40 .",
    "the limit between the high and low temperature regimes corresponds to the minimum @xmath41 of @xmath42 .",
    "we find @xmath43 .",
    "the correlation between the two extremal sites is nothing but @xmath44 } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mu } z[\\mu = 0 ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 \\propto \\sum_{\\sigma,\\sigma ' } e^{\\beta j_n \\sigma \\sigma ' } e^{\\mu \\sigma \\sigma ' } , \\ ] ] so that the correlation is simply @xmath46 , which decreases from unity to zero as @xmath2 increases from 1 to @xmath47 .",
    "the cross - over temperature @xmath8 corresponds to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , leading to the dominant behavior of the glass cross - over temperature @xmath50      the magnetization distribution becomes non gaussian below a temperature @xmath4 .",
    "this is due to the existence of macroscopic domains that are weakly connected ot the rest of the structure .",
    "the temperature cross - over @xmath4 is evaluated in section [ general ] in a more general context , so that we do not reproduce the argument here in the case of the hierarchical lattice .",
    "the result in the case of the hierarchical lattice is @xmath51 where we have kept only the dominant behavior for large @xmath2 .",
    "the results for the magnetization distribution are plotted on figure [ fig4 ] for @xmath52 . using ( [ t*1 ] ) for @xmath52",
    ", we get @xmath53 , which is consistent with the data of figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "notice that , in this case , @xmath54 .",
    "the regular simplex recursion is plotted on figure [ fig5 ] . the number of sites if @xmath55 , and the corresponding distance is @xmath56 , so that the fractal dimension is @xmath57 .",
    "the partition function in a zero external field can be calculated recursively by calculating the trace over the spins at the deepest generation . with the notations of figure [ fig5 ] ,",
    "the partition function is @xmath58 we look for @xmath59 under the form @xmath60 the renormalized form of @xmath59 has two parameters ( @xmath61 and @xmath19 ) , for two distinct equations : one for @xmath62 , and the other for @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are simply given by @xmath65 carrying out the trace over the @xmath66 variables leads to @xmath67 in the high temperature regime , the coupling constant renormalization is @xmath68 and , in the low temperature regime , @xmath69 , where @xmath37 .",
    "the cross - over between the high and low temperature regime is @xmath70 , with @xmath41 the minimum of @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the correlation function is @xmath73 } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mu } z[\\mu=0 ] , \\ ] ] with @xmath45 \\propto \\sum_{\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2,\\sigma_3 } \\exp{\\left(x_n ( \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2+\\sigma_1",

    "again , we do not reproduce the calculation of the magnetization cross - over temperature @xmath4 since a general argument in developed in section [ general ] .",
    "the result for the dominant behavior of @xmath4 in the limit of large @xmath2 is @xmath75 in the case @xmath76 ( which corresponds to figure [ fig6 ] ) , we have @xmath77 , which is consistent with the data of figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "notice also that , in the low temperature regime , when the non gaussian structure of the magnetization distribution is fully developped , it is possible to identify the origin of the different local maxima of @xmath78 .",
    "to do so , we carry out a low temperature expansion of the magnetization distribution around the broken symmetry state @xmath79 , up to the order @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "the result is @xmath82 + o(\\mu^{3 } ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath83 is a normalization constant and the set @xmath84 is @xmath85 \\rangle , \\exists k , \\exists l , 0 \\le l < k , m=3^{k } \\pm 3^{l } \\ } .\\ ] ] we can recognize on figure [ fig6 ] the contributions from @xmath86 but also from @xmath87 .",
    "we first recall what happens on the cayley tree @xcite , where there exists also a glassy cross - over , with @xmath88 , where @xmath2 is the number of generations of the tree , and also a crossover in the magnetization distribution , with @xmath89 .",
    "it is possible to derive exact recursion relations for the average magnetization , to solve the recurence , and to obtain the temperature cross - over @xmath4 .",
    "the cross - over temperature is interpreted as follows : below @xmath4 , there exists less than one broken bound on a path connecting the center of the tree to the leaves , which leads to the criterium for the magnetization distribution cross - over temperature : @xmath90 taking the logarithm leads to @xmath89 .    in the case of fractals , there are not bifurcations , so that the criterium corresponding to ( [ tree ] ) is @xmath91 which means that , at the cross - over , there exists only @xmath9 broken bounds on the graph , where @xmath9 is the number of bounds that need to be cut to isolate a @xmath92 generations fractals in the bulk of a @xmath2 generations fractal .",
    "this is the ramification order .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath93 in order to check this equation , we come back to the case of the hierarchical lattice , where we obtained recursively the partition function in an external magnetic field .",
    "we impose a small magnetic field , and calculate the partition function in the presence of the small magnetic field , and deduce the average magnetization numerically as a function of the number of generations . for a given number of generation , we look for the temperature for which the magnetization is a given constant .",
    "we thus obtain the curve @xmath94 , which is expected to be a straight line from equation ( [ cross ] ) .",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown on figure [ supp ] , which validates the previous heuristic argument .",
    "percolation clusters at the percolation threshold were studied in the past as an exemple of critical dynamics , with a glassy - like dynamics below @xmath8 @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the glass cross - over temperature @xmath8 is evaluated in @xcite with the argument that below @xmath8 , the correlation length @xcite @xmath95 is inferior to the linear size of the cluster .",
    "one gets easily @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath61 is the number of sites of the percolation cluster .",
    "the magnetization distribution of a single cluster at low temperatures looks like the one of regular fractals , apart from the fact that the localization of the local minima depends on the geometry and is not easy to localize .",
    "for instance , we generated a percolation cluster at threshold in a bidimensional imbeding space ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the corresponding low temperature magnetization distribution is plotted on figure [ fig7 ] for various temperatures .",
    "we show on figure [ fig8 ] two configurations belonging to the local maximum with a normalized number of up spins @xmath98 .",
    "the interpretation of the magnetization distribution thus depends crucially on the geometry .",
    "it is therefore legitimate to ask whether the local maxima structure persists after averaging over the geometry .",
    "the answer is ` no ' : we plotted on figure [ fig9 ] the magnetization distribution averaged over the geometry for different temperature .",
    "we observe no local maxima .",
    "if the temperature increases , the weight of the ferromagnetic maximum decreases , whereas the tail of the distribution increases , which is consistent with the fact that the magnetization distribution is gaussian in the high temperature regime .    moreover , by averaging over the geometry , we can adress the question of finite size effects .",
    "we plotted on figure [ fig10 ] the distribution of magnetization for two different sizes at the same temperature .",
    "we see that the small clusters have a more pronounced ferromagnetic peak , which is in agreement with the fact that @xmath4 decreases with the system size .",
    "we wish to analyze the correlation between the different spin configuration at a given temperature .",
    "to do so , we introduce @xmath2 replica of the spin system .",
    "we call @xmath99 the value of the potts variables in the replica @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , and we consider the following correlation : @xmath102 for a given geometry with a given magnetization ( all the replica have the same magnetization )",
    ". the variable q is the average magnetization : @xmath103 the correlation @xmath104 in a sector of given magnetization is nothing but a kind of edwards - anderson order parameter in a subspace of given magnetization . in the high temperature regime , @xmath105 is @xmath106 with a probability @xmath107 and @xmath108 with a probability @xmath107 , so that the average of @xmath109 is @xmath110 , so that @xmath111 if @xmath112 .",
    "we are interested in the variations of @xmath113 for a given magnetization as a function of the temperature .",
    "these variations are plotted on figure [ fig11 ] for a given geometry .",
    "the magnetization is @xmath114 .",
    "the four different curves are plotted for neighboring magnetizations . as expected",
    ", @xmath113 tends to @xmath115 above @xmath4 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath4 from this technique is coherent with the estimation from the analysis of the magnetization distribution ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we know from two different methods that the cross - over temperature @xmath4 for @xmath116 sites is about @xmath117 . from this data , we can deduce the ramification order @xmath9 , which , in the case of regular fractals was interpreted as the number of links to be cut to isolate a @xmath92 generations fractal inside a @xmath2 generations fractal ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "we deduce from ( [ cross ] ) and ( [ tgperco ] ) that @xmath119 on the other hand , we know that @xmath120 in a bidimensional imbedding space @xcite , and that @xmath121 @xcite . with @xmath116 sites ,",
    "we evaluate @xmath122 from ( [ tgperco ] ) . using ( [ eqx ] )",
    ", we get @xmath123 .",
    "the incertainty comes from the incertainty in the location of the cross - over temperature @xmath4 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the fact that the order of ramification of percolating clusters is believed to be finite and superior to two ( percolating clusters are not quasi one dimensional ) @xcite .",
    "we have studied the magnetization distribution on fractals with a zero temperature transition .",
    "below a temperature inverse proportional to the logarithm of the number of sites , and proportional to the order of ramification , the magnetization is not trivial , with local maxima .",
    "this is due to the fact that is is possible to cut the graph into many large parts , by breaking only a small number of links .",
    "we have introduced a magnetization - dependent edwards - anderson order parameter , the variations of which are correlated with the magnetization distribution . it would be interesting to have an analytical proof of this fact .",
    "we have shown in that the cross - over temperature @xmath4 of percolating clusters is related to the order of ramification of the structure .",
    "we find @xmath123 for bidimensional percolation clusters .",
    "the cross - over temperature @xmath4 can be estimated in two different ways : 1 ) by calculating directly the probability distribution at different temperatures 2 ) by calculating the correlation between equilibrium states with a given magnetization .",
    "our result is in agreement with the fact that the percolation cluster at threshold is not quasi one dimensional ( which was known a long time ago ! ) .",
    "however , it is clear that our method to determine the order of ramification is not accurate , since one has to estimate a cross - over temperature , which is determined up to a certain incertainty",
    ". it would be interesting to generalize this study to magnetized spin glass phases .",
