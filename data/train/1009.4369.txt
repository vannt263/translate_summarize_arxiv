    "as a first step to reconcile gravity and quantum physics , or to understand the quantum nature of gravity , quantum corrections to general relativity(gr ) have been extensively studied .",
    "the works on induced gravity@xcite can be considered as an approach to matter loop corrections to newton s constant , whereas 1-loop corrections to the massless graviton propagator were obtained for various types of fields : scalars@xcite , gauge bosons@xcite , fermions@xcite , and even gravitons themselves@xcite .    on a different front of the gravitational research ,",
    "the theory of massive gravity has been an interesting topic for both theoretical and phenomenological reasons .",
    "on the theory side , it has been studied how to deal with the classical pathologies of massive gravity , the most famous one being the van dam - veltman - zakharov(vdvz ) discontinuity@xcite : adding a mass term to the linearized einstein - hilbert action seems to be a natural way of giving mass to a graviton .",
    "but doing so breaks the general coordinate invariance(gci ) of gr , so that a massive theory ends up with more degrees of freedom(dofs ) than the massless one .",
    "requiring that none of these extra dofs have any pathology , one is forced to choose pauli - fierz(pf ) theory@xcite .",
    "then the coupling of the extra scalar dof to the sources remains finite even in the limit of vanishing graviton mass .",
    "that is , no matter how small the graviton mass is , the massive theory is finitely different from the massless one .    to elucidate , let us look at the linearized massive gravity action with a generic mass term in a flat 4d background : [ eqn : genericmassiveaction ] s_m_g , a = ^4 x \\{&_h^ _ h^ _ - _ h _ ^h^ + _ h ^h - _ h^ _ h + & - ( h^ h _ - a h^2 ) } , with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding tree level propagator is [ eqn : genericmassiveprop ] _",
    "m_g , a^(0)=_h2 + _ h0_1 + _ h0_2 + , where the @xmath2 s are a complete set of tensor bases with 4 indicies , whose definitions will be given in  [ sec - gloop ] .",
    "the propagator has a gr - like helicity-2 pole(@xmath3 ) and two helicity-0 ones(@xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , while @xmath6 is terms that vanish upon contraction with conserved sources . in the @xmath7 limit , ( [ eqn : genericmassiveprop ] )",
    "becomes @xmath8 , which is the same as the massless graviton propagator of gr , and hence we do not have any discontinuity problem .",
    "but unfortunately ( [ eqn : genericmassiveaction ] ) has a ghost dof ; ( [ eqn : genericmassiveprop ] ) shows that @xmath5 has a negative coupling .",
    "in fact , it is this ghost that cancels the other scalar in the massless limit , allowing a smooth transition to the massless theory .    by choosing @xmath9",
    "the ghost mode decouples because its mass diverges , and we obtain pf theory : [ eqn : pfmassiveprop ] * p*_m_g^(0)= ( -+ ) + + .",
    "but then @xmath4 survives the @xmath7 limit , creating an untraversable gap between the massive and the massless theories .",
    "how or if we can remove this discontinuity has been an active subject of research@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the phenomenological reason to study massive gravity is a possibility of solving ( a part of ) the cosmological constant(@xmath10 ) problem by modifying gravity at large distances . among many proposed solutions to the @xmath10 problem , the infrared(ir ) modification of gravity",
    "is the idea that gravity behaves differently at large distance scales compared to short distances .",
    "let us assume that by some mechanism , , @xcite , we succeed in achieving vanishing @xmath10 .",
    "the next step is to reconcile our zero @xmath10 with the small but non - zero @xmath10 calculated from the observational data .",
    "the  observed \" @xmath10@xcite is obtained with the assumption that gr holds at all scales .",
    "then we can imagine that if the characteristic of the  real \" gravity is different from that of gr , interpreting the data with the right gravity may give an explanation to the accelerated expansion of the universe without @xmath10 .",
    "but this idea gets severely constrained by experiments and observations which confirm the validity of gr from @xmath11 to the solar system scale .",
    "therefore , the desired modification of gravity should be consistent with gr at short distances , while getting weaker than gr at large distances in order to mimic @xmath10 .",
    "pf theory meets our demands in the ir , but fails to satisfy the short distance criterion because of the vdvz discontinuity .    while interesting enough already at the classical level , not much attention has been paid to the quantum aspects of massive gravity theories . in this article",
    ", we will explore what the combination of  quantum effects \" and  massive gravity \" can offer , by investigating loop corrections to pf theory from the minimally coupled massive scalar([sec - sloop ] ) , the graviton with a generic cubic interaction([sec - gloop ] ) and the graviton with an arbitrary interaction([sec - resum ] ) .",
    "as a warm - up exercise , let us consider the loop contribution from a real massive scalar field minimally coupled to gravity : [ eqn : gsa ] s_= ^4x ( g^__+m^2 ^ 2 ) .    for @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the planck mass , we expand ( [ eqn : gsa ] ) in @xmath14 to get s_&= ^4x & (",

    ", we can immediately see that the tree level theory gets renormalized by @xmath52 , which is a progress over the 1-loop analysis where it was not clear which counterterm renormalized what .",

    "m_g&= & ( - + ) + + + & & + ( * i*_3 + * i*_4 + * i*_5 ) , with ^2 & = & , we notice that ( [ eqn : pfloopsumrw ] ) takes the same form as the tree level _",
    "non_-pf propagator , ( [ eqn : genericmassiveprop ] ) , implying that a generic interaction revives the ghost 6th mode .",
    "but ( [ eqn : pfloopsum ] ) shows how to avoid this pathology : the ghost pole can be removed if [ eqn : ngcon ] b_5k^4 + 2(2b_3+b_4)k^2+b_1 + 2b_2 = 0 .",
    "therefore , in order to be quantum - safe , 1pi from a desirable interaction should satisfy at least ( [ eqn : condiv ] ) and ( [ eqn : ngcon ] ) .",
    "through straightforward loop calculations and the analysis on the propagator , we showed that although loop corrections from a quantum interaction may spoil pf massive gravity by reviving the 6th mode ghost , we may still be able to have a healthy theory by requiring the allowed interactions to satisfy appropriate conditions .",
    "then the next task would be to find the right interactions . for this purpose ,",
    "understanding why the cubic interaction of  [ sec - gloop ] failed would be useful .",
    "in fact , the results of  [ sec - gloop ] should not be surprising , once we realize that in pf the elimination of the 6th mode is achieved by an onshell symmetry . to identify this symmetry ,",
    "we start with the action , ( [ eqn : genericmassiveaction ] ) , with a generic mass term .",
    "the equation of motion for the graviton , @xmath53 , with a source , @xmath54 , is t _ & = & ^2 h _ -_^2 h - _ _ h^_- _ _ h^_+ _ _ h + _ _ _ h^ + & & - m_g^2(h _ - a _ h ) . on the rhs , terms with derivatives come from the einstein tensor , and the bianchi identity guarantees that their contraction with @xmath55 vanishes .",
    "then for a conserved source , , @xmath56 , we get the following onshell constraint : [ eqn : osc ] 0 = ^h _ - a _ h .",
    "next we vary ( [ eqn : genericmassiveaction ] ) under the infinitesimal coordinate transformation , @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "again , terms with derivatives are @xmath59 and therefore invariant .",
    "a remainder of the variation of the mass term is s_m_g = m_g^2 ^4x ^(^h _ - a _ h ) . then a generic massive gravity seems to have gci if the constraint ( [ eqn : osc ] ) is imposed",
    "of course this is not true , because we have yet to take into account that the transformed field should also satisfy ( [ eqn : osc ] ) , , [ eqn : cstrntonxi ] 0 = ^h _ - a _ h = ( 1 - 2a)__^+ ^2_. decomposing @xmath60 into a transverse vector @xmath61 and a longitudinal scalar @xmath62 such that @xmath63 , ( [ eqn : cstrntonxi ] ) becomes [ eqn : cstrntoxi1 ] ^2^t_+ 2(1-a)_^2= 0 .",
    "thus we end up with @xmath64 and for @xmath65 @xmath62 should also vanish : non - pf action has no symmetry .",
    "but when @xmath9 , which is the case of pf theory , ( [ eqn : cstrntoxi1 ] ) can be satisfied with a nontrivial @xmath62 , and pf theory has a residual symmetry parametrized by @xmath66 .",
    "since this symmetry works under the _ onshell _ constraint ( [ eqn : osc ] ) , it may not be preserved when we go offshell in the loop calculations .",
    "therefore further efforts to find a quantum - safe theory of massive gravity can be directed in two different ways :    1 .",
    "we may try to construct a nonlinear completion of pf where the 6th mode is removed by a _ full _ symmetry .",
    "2 .   we can attempt to directly find a quantum interaction whose 1pi satisfies , ( [ eqn : condiv ] ) and ( [ eqn : ngcon ] ) .    with various versions@xcite of the completion of pf already at hand",
    ", it would be straightforward to pursue ( i ) , which in the end might lead us to the right interaction sought after in ( ii ) .",
