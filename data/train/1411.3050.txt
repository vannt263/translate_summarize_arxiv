    "for geometric frustrated magnetic materials it is impossible to choose one conguration with minimal energy by the individual minimization of the magnetic moments interactions .",
    "consequently , their ground states are degenerated .",
    "the most studied cases are systems with crystalline structures composed by triangles and tetrahedrons with nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction of their magnetic moments  @xcite . recently frustration has been observed in jarosites and pyrochlore oxides as a result of ferromagnetic interaction  @xcite . in these structures",
    "the spins are arranged in kagom and pyrochlore lattices and forced to point in towards the center of the triangles and tetrahedrons respectively .",
    "for this reason , there is only the two possible states , `` in '' or `` out '' , and therefore can be approximated through the classical ising model . since the angle between the spins the ferro - antiferromagnetic rule is changed so ferromagnetic systems can be mapped by the antiferromagnetic ising model and vice - versa  @xcite .",
    "these systems are called spin ice because of the similarity between their ground state conguration and the pauli model for the water ice . due to the simplicity of the ising model in comparison with heisenberg they became a model for the study of geometric frustration . in some cases it is even possible an analytic treatment in order to compare to experimental and computational results  @xcite .",
    "the recent artificial production of the first spin ices in the square and honeycomb lattices had attracted a lot of attention  @xcite .",
    "they are constructed with bi - dimensional sequences of nanoislands with ferromagnetic magnetic moments considered as effective ising spins .",
    "recently it was possible to produce artificial jarosite and volborthite crystals with practically no distortions or impurities , something not possible for natural materials found in nature  @xcite .",
    "another recent example of the ising model is the study of magnetic materials in the triangular kagom lattice , artificially produced , as an alternative for adiabatic demagnetization  @xcite .",
    "they consist of a kagom lattice with an inserted site between two nearest - neighbors .",
    "additionally it can be used in the study of the exchange coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "they are composed of sequences kagom lattices with weak interaction between the layers so they are considered bidimensional structures .",
    "in this paper it is presented an alternative to the conventional representation of the kagom  @xcite and pyrochlore  @xcite lattices for monte carlo study of spins systems .",
    "furthermore , the critical temperatures and exponents using the standard ferromagnetic ising model is shown . as suggested ,",
    "there are the studies of the xy and heisenberg models for these lattices or the addition of the dipolar term in the ising model  @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility of the study of critical quantities and phase diagram for diluted cases .",
    "the kagom lattice is a two - dimensional arrangement of sites with four nearest - neighbors as shown in figure  [ fig : kagome ] .",
    "the unitary cell in gray has three sites with bonds forming equilateral triangles , each site in an indenpendent rhombic sublattices labeled a , b and c. for a site with label @xmath0 and coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 its nearest - neighbors are defined using the two versors *  * and *  * as shown in table  [ tab : kag_neighbors ] ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a , b and c respectivelly ) .",
    "the sites are indexed by @xmath6 , the space between the sites are set to 1 and @xmath7 .",
