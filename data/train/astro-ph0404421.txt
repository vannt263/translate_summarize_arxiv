    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) come in a variety of shapes , irregular , bipolar , or spherical , and exhibit emission from forbidden lines such as [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] as well as from the h@xmath3 recombination line .",
    "in addition , numerous high - excitation pne exhibit most of the other balmer lines as well as , ] , and other forbidden lines such as [ ] , [ ] , [ ] .",
    "the typical radial extent is a few tenths of a parsec .",
    "only a few pne have radii exceeding 1.5  pc .",

    "we report the discovery of an emitting nebula around kpd  0005 + 5106 with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ that we identify as a high - ionization pn ( hipn ) around this white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "this would make kpd  0005 + 5106 only the third wd ( out of 162 wds listed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) known to have a pn . including kpd  0005 + 5106 , only eight of the fifteen stars listed with @xmath4  k @xcite have a known pn .",
    "the _ fuse _ instrument consists of four optical systems .",
    "two employ lif coatings and are sensitive to the wavelength range @xmath5   .",
    "the other two use sic coatings and are sensitive to wavelengths between 905 and 1100   .",
    "each spectrograph possesses three apertures that simultaneously observe different positions on the sky separated by a few arcminutes ( for a complete description of _ fuse _ , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the strong interstellar h@xmath6 features in its spectrum , the wd kpd  0005 + 5106 was selected as a wavelength - calibration target and has been observed repeatedly throughout the mission . when the _ fuse _ high- or medium - resolution aperture is centered on the star , the low - resolution ( lwrs )",
    "aperture samples a @xmath7 region 1.8 or 3.5 arcmin ( respectively ) away .",
    "changes in the spacecraft roll angle from one observation to another place the lwrs aperture at different position angles around the star .",
    "figure [ map ] shows the observed lwrs positions . in three additional background observations ,",
    "the lwrs aperture was 2.2 arcmin from the star .",
    "table [ obs ] lists the observational data for each pointing : observation i d , equatorial coordinates of the lwrs aperture , date of the observation , and the polar coordinates for the lwrs aperture relative to kpd  0005 + 5106 .",
    "angle @xmath8 is measured counterclockwise from the north celestial pole .",
    "a map key identifies the lwrs positions in figure [ map ] .",
    "all observations were performed in time - tag mode , in which the spectrograph records the position and arrival time of each photon .",
    "the individual exposures of each pointing were aligned using the measured positions of the airglow lines between 1027 and 1042   .",
    "the data were screened for pulse heights in the range @xmath9 , shifted to a heliocentric wavelength scale , and combined , and the region around the @xmath10 1032,1038 doublet was extracted .",
    "the spectra were binned by 16 pixels to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a more detailed description of the data reduction can be found in our emission survey paper ( otte , dixon , & sankrit 2004 , in preparation ) .    in most cases , we used night - only data to avoid possible contamination by an unidentified airglow feature near the @xmath11 line . for m1070208 , m1070223 , and m1070224 , we combined day and night data to obtain a more reliable measurement of the faint emission ; contamination by the airglow feature could be excluded in these cases ( by comparing the day - plus - night and night - only data ) .    due to their nearly identical positions ,",
    "the data of observations m1070211 and m1070214 were combined into one spectrum , as were the data of observations m1070212 and m1070215 .",
    "although the overlap of their positions is less than for the other two combined observations , we combined m1070209 and m1070221 to gain signal - to - noise at the expense of spatial resolution .",
    "all spectra were fit using the iraf routine specfit @xcite with emission - line models consisting of a convolution of a gaussian and a 106  km  s@xmath1 wide flat - top profile representing the lwrs aperture . the spectrum with the brightest @xmath01032 feature ( s4054403 , map key 3 ) is shown in figure [ spec ] .",
    "the intensities derived from our fits to the emission lines are listed in table [ meas ] . due to its low signal - to - noise ratio , possible blending with the @xmath12 @xmath01037 line , and vicinity to the @xmath01039 airglow line , the @xmath01038 emission line was difficult to fit in many cases .",
    "to date , the intensities of diffuse @xmath01032 emission detected with _ fuse _",
    "range from 1700 to 11,000  lu , with an average value of @xmath13  lu ( otte , dixon , & sankrit 2004 , in preparation ) times brighter is detected in supernova remnant shocks .",
    "these , however , are well identified nebulae and not considered part of the diffuse interstellar medium . ] . with a peak intensity of 25,000  lu ,",
    "the high - ionization nebula around kpd  0005 + 5106 is the brightest region of extended emission yet found .",
    "with a surface temperature @xmath14  k , kpd  0005 + 5106 is the hottest known do ( i.e. helium - rich ) wd . the stellar spectrum has been observed at x - ray , ultraviolet , and optical wavelengths .",
    "model fits yield stellar parameters of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and a distance of about 270  pc ( werner , heber , & fleming 1994 ; werner et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the star possesses a soft x - ray corona @xcite , and appears to undergo mass ejection @xcite .    in the @xmath17 diagram ,",
    "kpd  0005 + 5106 lies between the highest - gravity pg  1159 stars known to have pne and the two do wd pn candidates pg  0108 + 101 and pg  0109 + 111 .",
    "the discovery of a pn around the do wd pg  1034 + 001 @xcite extends the range of known pne in the @xmath17 plane along the evolutionary tracks toward lower temperatures and higher surface gravities ( @xmath18  k ; werner , dreizler , & wolff 1995 ) .",
    "kpd  0005 + 5106 lies well within this extended parameter space .",
    "however , previous searches for an optical pn around this wd have been unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "photoionized is expected from pn with hot central stars ( @xmath4  k ) and has been detected in a few such objects ( chu , gruendl , & guerrero 2004 ) .",
    "we used the photoionization code cloudy to determine whether photoionization of a putative pn around kpd0005 + 5106 could explain the detected emission . for the ionizing source",
    ", we used a synthetic spectrum of the star calculated with the program tlusty @xcite , using the observed stellar abundances and parameters @xcite .",
    "the stellar model was scaled to the flux observed with _",
    "fuse_. simple pn expansion models by @xcite yield densities of a few @xmath19 at the distances of the lwrs aperture positions for a @xmath20  yr old pn .",
    "we assumed solar abundances and a particle density of unity ( i.e. , @xmath21  @xmath19 ) in the absorbing cloud . with no other free parameters ,",
    "our model reproduces the observed flux to within a factor of a few .",
    "based on this agreement between model predictions and observations , we conclude that the nebula around kpd  0005 + 5106 is photoionized",
    ". it may be one of a new class of hipne that are faint in standard optical lines .",
    "our photoionization model predicts a [ ] @xmath03426 intensity seven times as bright as the emission , whereas shock models yield [ ] intensities @xmath22 times fainter than the emission .",
    "this discriminant has been used to argue that the nebula lmc  62 in the large magellanic cloud is photoionized @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath16 , @xmath23 , and extrapolating the extinction parameterization of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) to the lyman limit , we find that the [ ] emission should be about 20 times brighter than the observed @xmath01032 emission around this wd .",
    "the photoionization model predicts that the [ ] emission arises in a more extended zone than the emission . though the geometry of the emitting gas is unknown , [ ]",
    "imaging would allow us to confirm the existence of hipne around this and other hot wds .",
    "another prediction of a radiation - bounded hipn is the presence of a low surface brightness h@xmath3 and [ ] @xmath05007 nebula with a large angular diameter as has been observed around pg  1034 + 001 @xcite , because lower ionization states are only possible at larger distances from the hot star .",
    "the pn search around kpd  0005 + 5106 by @xcite likely had too small a field of view to detect such an extended pn .      as the central star of a pn contracts and its temperature rises , its radiation field becomes harder .",
    "meanwhile , the expansion of the nebula causes its density to fall .",
    "the combination of these effects raises the ionization parameter ( the ratio of photon density to particle density ) at the inner face of the nebula , and with it the ionization state of the gas .",
    "this scenario has two implications : first , that every pn with a central star massive enough to reach a temperature greater than @xmath24  k will eventually pass through a high - ionization phase ; second , that every hot white dwarf should exhibit a hipn .",
    "observations of hipne around hot wds may reveal important information about wd precursors and their evolution .",
    "one unresolved problem , for example , is the existence of helium - rich , hydrogen - deficient wds that account for about 20% of all known degenerate stars @xcite . with the precursors abundances imprinted in the diffuse gas",
    ", hipne could give clues to the evolutionary process that results in this bizarre type of wds .    the photoionization model with unit hydrogen density and solar abundances ,",
    "[ o / h]@xmath25 , predicts that the thickness of the emitting zone is approximately @xmath26  cm . in this region ,",
    "the fractional abundance o@xmath27/o is about 0.11 , which translates to a number density @xmath28  @xmath19 .",
    "the column density is thus about @xmath29  @xmath2 .",
    "depending on the distribution of hot wds in the galactic disk , hipne could contribute a significant fraction to the total column density in the plane .",
