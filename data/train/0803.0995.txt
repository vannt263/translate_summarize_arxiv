    "one particular implication of that good agreement between theory and experiment is that the quark condensate @xmath16 constitutes the leading order parameter @xcite of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( considering the two - flavor sector of qcd ) . as a consequence",
    ", one can assert that more than @xmath17 of the ( squared ) pion mass , @xmath18mev/@xmath19 , must stem from the term linear in the light quark mass multiplied with the quark condensate @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dirac experiment @xcite at cern has been proposed to determine the difference of the isospin - zero and isospin - two s - wave @xmath8-scattering lengths @xmath21 by measuring the life time ( @xmath22fs ) of pionium ( i.e. @xmath14 bound electromagnetically and decaying into @xmath23 ) . in the meantime",
    "the na48/2 collaboration @xcite at cern has accumulated very high statistics for the charged kaon decay modes @xmath24 , which allowed them to extract the value @xmath25 for the @xmath8-scattering length difference from the cusp effect in the @xmath23 mass spectrum at the @xmath14 threshold .",
    "this experimental result is again in very good agreement with the two - loop prediction @xmath26 of chiral perturbation theory @xcite . for a discussion of isospin breaking corrections which have to be included in a meaningful comparison between theory and experiment , see also ref.@xcite . clearly , these remarkable confirmations give confidence that chiral perturbation theory is the correct framework to calculate reliably and accurately the strong interaction dynamics of the pions at low energies .",
    "electromagnetic processes offer further possibilities to probe the internal structure of the pion .",
    "whereas the charge ( or vector ) form factor of the pion , @xmath27 , is largely dominated by the low - lying @xmath28-resonance , pion compton scattering @xmath1 allows one to extract the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the ( charged ) pion . in a classical picture",
    "these polarizabilities characterize the deformation response ( i.e. induced dipole moments ) of a composite system in external electric and magnetic fields . in the proper quantum field",
    "theoretical formulation the electric and magnetic polarizabilities , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are defined as expansion coefficients of the compton scattering amplitudes at threshold .",
    "since pion targets are not directly available , real pion compton scattering has been approached using different artifices , such as high - energy pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung @xmath31 @xcite , radiative pion production off the proton @xmath32 @xcite , and the crossed channel two - photon reaction @xmath33 as embedded in the @xmath34 process @xcite .",
    "the corresponding results for the electric and magnetic pion polarizabilities scatter substantially and they have also large uncertainties . on the other hand , chiral perturbation theory at two - loop order gives the firm prediction @xmath35@xmath36 @xcite for the polarizability difference .",
    "it is however in conflict with the existing experimental results from serpukhov @xmath37@xmath36 @xcite and mami @xmath38@xmath36 @xcite which amount to values more than twice as large .",
    "the result @xmath39@xmath36 @xcite extracted from the mark ii data @xcite is consistent with the chiral prediction , but the corresponding low - energy cross sections for @xmath40 are ( within their errorbars ) rather insensitive to even sizeable changes of the pion polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "we also note that radiative pion photoproduction @xmath32 has recently been considered in the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in ref.@xcite that additional contributions from @xmath41 vertices in the chiral lagrangian @xmath42 may have effects on the cross section which are comparable to those of the pion polarizabilities .",
    "in that situation , it is very promising that the ongoing compass experiment @xcite at cern aims at measuring the pion polarizabilities , @xmath29 and @xmath43 , with high statistics using the primakoff effect .",
    "the scattering of high - energy negative pions in the coulomb field of a heavy nucleus ( of charge @xmath44 ) gives access to cross sections for @xmath45 reactions through the equivalent photon method : @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the @xmath45 center - of - mass energy and @xmath48 the squared invariant momentum transfer between the initial and final state pion .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is to review the cross sections for various low - energy @xmath45 reactions in the framework of chiral perturbation theory .",

    "the expected accuracy of the compass experiment , and the knowledge that two - loop corrections @xcite are relatively small , this approximation should be sufficient .",
    "then , we consider ( at one - loop order ) the reaction @xmath54 which is also under study in the compass experiment .",
    "it serves as a test of the qcd chiral anomaly via measuring the @xmath4-coupling constant @xmath5 .",
    "as the pertinent one - loop amplitudes are available from the literature , we restrict here ourselves to a concise but explicit presentation of the relevant cross section formulas .",
    "actually new is our calculation of total cross sections for neutral and charged pion - pair production , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which interestingly are determined by the chiral @xmath8-interaction . with the larger data sample planned in future compass",

    "it should be stressed that the current - algebra relation @xmath83 constitutes a low - energy theorem @xcite which must hold ( to leading order ) in any chiral invariant theory . from this point of view , the parametrization of @xmath2 in terms of a phenomenological @xmath84-meson exchange , as chosen in ref.@xcite , is problematic since it ignores that profound theoretical constraint . moreover , as stressed in ref.@xcite the outcome @xmath85 of the chiral invariant linear @xmath84-model is completely ruled out by experiment , because it leads to an axialvector - to - vector form factor ratio @xmath86 of the wrong sign . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the actual physics behind the low - energy constant @xmath78 is the excitation of vector and axialvector meson resonances @xcite . in the same way the existing experimental determinations of @xmath87@xmath36 @xcite give reason to doubts since they violate the chiral low - energy theorem notably by a factor @xmath88 . in order to clarify the situation on the theoretical side ,",
    "a complete two - loop calculation of pion polarizabilities has been performed in ref.@xcite , grinding out the analytical result : @xmath89 expressed in terms of the chiral low - energy constants @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",

    "taking into account various theoretical uncertainties , the two - loop prediction amounts to : @xmath100@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "as this value is fully compatible with the current - algebra result , it is now assured that there are no significant corrections to the chiral low - energy theorem for the pion polarizability difference @xmath101 . for a more detailed discussion of these issues , see ref.@xcite .",
    "the non - vanishing two - loop prediction for the pion polarizability sum , @xmath102@xmath36 @xcite , is in fact consistent with results from dispersion sum rules @xcite but presumably too small to cause an observable effect in pion compton scattering .",

    "this finding is of course not entirely new @xcite .",
    "the angular dependence of the differential cross section @xmath109 is shown in fig.2 for three selected center - of - mass energies , @xmath110 .",
    "the full curves are calculated with ( assumed ) pion polarizabilities @xmath111@xmath36 and the dashed lines correspond to the case of a structureless pion : @xmath112   \\over s[s(1+z)+m_\\pi^2(1-z)]^2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath113 .",
    "one gets instructed that the effects of the pion s low - energy structure on observables are rather small . for @xmath114 , they amount to at most an @xmath115 percent reduction of the differential cross section in backward directions , @xmath116 .",
    "this gives some impression of the experimental challenge posed for measuring with good accuracy the pion polarizabilities .",
    "first , low - energy @xmath45 cross sections ( e.g. @xmath117 ) need to be extracted from the primakoff events in the coulomb peak . secondly , these must come with an accuracy such that the deviations from the point - like cross section become statistically significant .",
    "we also note that the ( quadratic ) pion - loop contribution @xmath118 in eq.(5 ) works against the ( linear ) polarizability term @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , leaving it out in an analysis of pion compton scattering data would lead to an underestimation of the pion polarizabilities @xmath120 . in the optimal case their fitted value",
    "should also be independent of the upper limit put on the center - of - mass energy @xmath121 .    in order to visualize more directly the effect of the pion polarizabilities , we show in fig.3 the ratio @xmath122 between the differential cross sections ( at one - loop order ) in backward direction , @xmath123 , evaluated with finite polarizabilities @xmath124@xmath36 , and with polarizabilities set equal to zero . at @xmath125",

    ", it would also be interesting to see how the ratio displayed in fig.3 gets affected by the two - loop corrections of ref.@xcite , in particular because of the presence of a branch point at @xmath127 .     between the differential cross sections in backward direction ( @xmath123 ) calculated with finite , @xmath128@xmath36 , and with zero pion polarizabilities .",
