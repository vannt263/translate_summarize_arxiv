    "the annual modulation anomaly from the dama experiment is an intriguing hint of the identity of dark matter @xcite .",
    "direct detection experiments such as dama measure the energy of nuclear recoils from incident dark matter particles",
    ". the signal experiences an annual modulation because of the variation of the earth s relative motion with respect to the dark matter in the halo . while the dama experiment has measured an @xmath0 modulation with the correct phase , its results are in conflict with those from cdms @xcite , xenon10 @xcite , cresst @xcite , zeplin - ii @xcite , and zeplin - iii @xcite , which measure the total , unmodulated scattering rate .",
    "all current direct detection experiments are optimized to look for elastic scattering , which has an exponentially falling recoil energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "a distinguishing feature of dama s measured modulation spectrum is that it is suppressed at energies below @xmath1 25 kevnr , where elastic events should dominate .",
    "dama s results , taken together with the null results from all other direct detection experiments , can be elegantly explained if the dark matter scatters inelastically off of nuclei to an adjacent state that is @xmath2 more massive than the ground state @xcite . in the case of inelastic dark matter ( idm ) , a minimum velocity is needed to upscatter and the recoil spectrum is suppressed below this kinematic threshold .",
    "inelastic dark matter has three features that lead to the consistency of all current experiments .",
    "first , idm has a much larger dependence on the earth s velocity than elastic dark matter and thus the annual modulation is often 25% or larger , in comparison to @xmath3 for elastic scattering .",
    "this decreases dama s unmodulated cross section by a factor of 10 or more and therefore reduces the expected signal by the same factor in all experiments looking for unmodulated scattering .",
    "second , idm dominantly scatters off heavier nuclei and lighter nuclei may not have enough kinetic energy to excite the transition . as a result",
    ", cdms sensitivity is strongly suppressed due to inelastic kinematics .",
    "lastly , inelastic scattering events have higher recoil energies than elastic events .",
    "recent experiments such as xenon10 and zeplin - iii have shrunk their recoil energy window to eliminate higher energy scattering events , reducing the acceptance for idm .",
    "however , xenon10 has recently reanalyzed their data over a larger signal window to be sensitive to idm and their latest results are used in this article @xcite .    a dynamical alternative to the inelastic hypothesis",
    "was recently discussed in @xcite ; in this scenario , the interaction between the dark matter and standard model ( sm ) is elastic , but is suppressed by a form factor @xmath4 if the first term in this expansion vanishes , the elastic scattering rate is multiplied by additional factors of @xmath5 and goes to zero as @xmath6 .",
    "form factor - suppressed scattering can arise from multipole , polarization , and charge - radius interactions between the dark sector and the standard model @xcite .",
    "the recoil spectrum for form factor elastic dark matter ( ffedm ) is suppressed at low energies and more closely resembles the spectrum for inelastic events rather than standard elastic events , which peaks at low energies .",
    "however , it is more challenging to reconcile dama and the null experiments using only ffedm because the form factor depends on the product @xmath7 and any suppression for light nuclei can be compensated by looking at larger energies .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a scenario where inelastic scattering is complemented by a form factor - suppressed elastic component .",
    "these scenarios arise , for example , in composite dark matter models @xcite and yield new challenges for direct detection phenomenology . as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : annmod ] , the modulation amplitude for inelastic scattering with subdominant charge - radius scattering ( dashed line ) resembles that for inelastic scattering ( solid line ) and is markedly different from the regular elastic spectrum .",
    "distinguishing the elastic and inelastic contributions is critical for understanding the underlying structure of the theory .",
    "this article addresses how directional detection experiments , which can measure the direction of the nuclear recoil in addition to its energy @xcite , can differentiate the contributions to the scattering rate . in the following section , we review the direct detection phenomenology . in sect .",

    "these assumptions are not consistent with recent n - body simulations of dark matter particles ; simulations such as via lactea @xcite show that the dark matter velocity dispersion is anisotropic and that the density falls off more steeply at larger radii than in the isothermal scenario .",

    "the parameter @xmath56 changes the shape of the profile near the escape velocity .",
    "inelastic scattering events are particularly sensitive to the high - velocity tail because their minimum velocity is larger in comparison to the elastic case @xcite .    to find the regions of parameter space consistent with current direct detection experiments , we perform a global chi - squared analysis and marginalize over the six unknown parameters : @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the cross section per nucleon .",

    "we show that additional information about the nuclear recoil direction is a critical component in understanding the dynamics of the dark sector .",
    "directional detection experiments take advantage of the daily modulation in the direction of the dark matter wind in the lab frame , which arises from the earth s rotation around the galactic center @xcite . in particular",

    "several directional detection experiments are currently running : dmtpc @xcite , newage @xcite , drift @xcite , and mimac @xcite . to get reasonable angular resolution , the track left by the recoiling nucleus must be sufficiently long ( @xmath90 mm ) .",

    "it was recently pointed out that directional detection experiments can serve as important tests of inelastic dark matter @xcite if much heavier atoms are used in the detectors . in this section ,",
    "we show that such experiments are the key to distinguishing the contributions from elastic and inelastic scattering components in the dark matter sector . to begin , we will briefly review how the rate equation derived in the previous section is generalized to include the angular dependence of the recoiling nucleus .",

    "this can also be seen explicitly from the rate equation , where the largest fraction of the parameter space is allowed when @xmath107 in the delta function , which makes sense because the rate is maximized when the earth is moving in the same direction as the dark matter wind .",
    "the second important feature arises from the theta function in @xmath108 . in particular",
    ", there is a maximum value of @xmath109 above which the rate is zero : @xmath110 this cutoff depends on the minimum velocity , which is larger for inelastic scattering than elastic scattering . as a result , the recoil spectrum for any inelastic scattering component will have a cut off _",

    ", width=336 ]    whether the elastic and inelastic scattering components can be distinguished depends on whether there are enough events that fall along the tail of the spectrum .",
    "[ fig : crossover ] shows the expected rate at the value of @xmath109 where the transition from inelastic to elastic scattering occurs .",
    "the spread arises from varying over the six unknowns of both the particle physics and halo profile models .",
    "even given the uncertainties of the halo profile distribution , one can obtain enough events on the @xmath113 tail for discovery with approximately 5 - 10 kg years - worth of data .",
    "this is well within reach of current experiments ; the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossover ] show the projected sensitivity of the dmtpc experiment , assuming a cf@xmath91 detector .",
    "if a heavier detector material is used , as would be needed to test for inelastic dark matter , then the sensitivity should be even larger .",
    "we have shown that directional detection experiments can distinguish mixed inelastic - elastic scattering scenarios that would otherwise be difficult to discover unambiguously , even with next - generation experiments such as lux and xenon100 . in particular , directional detection experiments can detect elastic wide angle scatters that are kinematically forbidden in inelastic transitions . to evade current null experiments ,",
    "a relatively large exposure of several @xmath114 is needed , but this is well within reach of current detectors . however , these experiments are currently optimized to look for spin - dependent elastic scattering and need to use heavier nuclei , such as iodine or xenon , to have sensitivity to inelastic recoils .",
    "distinguishing different scattering mechanisms is critical for understanding the underlying symmetry structure of dark matter theories .",
    "many types of inelastic models can give small elastic scattering contributions .",
    "for instance , nontrivial scattering mechanisms arise in models where the dark matter has a finite size , such as composite @xcite , atomic @xcite , mirror @xcite , and quirky @xcite dark matter .",
    "all these models have several scattering channels with a hierarchy of scales given by a series of higher dimensional operators .",
    "both elastic and inelastic operators may be allowed , and approximate discrete symmetries may cause the elastic scattering rate to be subdominant to the inelastic rate @xcite .",
    "another class of models that leads to form factor - suppressed elastic scattering is characterized by a pseudo - goldstone mediator between the dark sector and the sm @xcite . in this case",
    ", additional dimension six operators in the lagrangian may no longer be negligible in comparison to the standard spin - independent and spin - dependent operators .",
    "these higher dimension operators lead to momentum suppression in the scattering rate .",
    "there has been much interest recently in models with light mediators @xcite , given the results from pamela @xcite , fermi @xcite , atic @xcite , and hess @xcite .",
    "if the dark sector does indeed have non - minimal structure , it may give rise to several types of scattering mechanisms .",

    "<S> inelastic dark matter reconciles the dama anomaly with other null direct detection experiments and points to a non - minimal structure in the dark matter sector . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the dominant inelastic interaction , dark matter scattering may have a subdominant elastic component . </S>",
    "<S> if these elastic interactions are suppressed at low momentum transfer , they will have similar nuclear recoil spectra to inelastic scattering events . while upcoming direct detection experiments will see strong signals from such models </S>",
    "<S> , they may not be able to unambiguously determine the presence of the subdominant elastic scattering from the recoil spectra alone . </S>",
    "<S> we show that directional detection experiments can separate elastic and inelastic scattering events and discover the underlying dynamics of dark matter models . </S>"
