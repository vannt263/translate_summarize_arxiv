    "in recent years , it became possible to adsorb organic molecules via thiol groups to a metallic gold surface and , thus , to establish a stable contact between the molecule and the gold .",

    "experiments for such molecular conductance can be achieved in essentially two ways : one possible setup is an open break junction bridged by a molecule @xcite .",
    "there , the current measurement provides evidence for _ single _ molecule conductance because asymmetries in the current - voltage characteristics reflect asymmetries of the molecule @xcite .",

    "the treatment of these models can be distinguished according to the level at which interaction is taken into account . here",
    ", we are in particular interested in two cases in which the many - body problem can be traced back to the dynamics of single electrons on the wire : the first case premises non - interacting electrons for which the current can be computed from a landauer - like formula @xcite .",
    "the second case deals with the opposite limit in which coulomb repulsion is so strong that at most one excess electron can be located on the molecule .",
    "such theories have been developed in the context of conduction through coupled quantum dots @xcite and for the incoherent transport through molecular wires @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we derive a master equation approach for molecular conduction in the limit of strong coulomb repulsion which restricts the population of the molecular orbitals to zero or one excess electron .",
    "thereby , particular care will be taken in avoiding inconsistencies like spurious non - vanishing transport in equilibrium situations .",
    "we present in section  [ sec : model ] our working model and derive in section  [ sec : current ] a master equation which we evaluate for the two mentioned limits , namely non - interacting electrons and strong coulomb repulsion .",

    "for this situation , we follow the approach of ref .",
    "the second limit is the one of strong coulomb repulsion in which @xmath3 is much larger than any other energy scale of the problem .",
    "then , only the states with at most one excess electron on the wire are relevant .    in both cases , a diagonal representation of the first term on the right - hand side of the master equation",
    "is achieved by a decomposition into the eigenbasis of the single - particle wire hamiltonian . in this basis , the fermionic interaction picture operators read @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes an eigenstate with energy @xmath47 .",

    "for the sake of completeness , we remark that from the master equation   follows @xmath65 in the stationary state .",
    "it can be shown that if the wire consists of just one site , i.e.  for @xmath66 , both the master equation for @xmath44 and the one for @xmath67 provide identical expressions for the current .",
    "the reason for this is that already the pauli principle inhibits the occupation of the molecule by more than one electron .      for very weak wire ",
    "lead coupling , the coherent time - evolution dominates the dynamics of the wire electrons .",
    "this means that the largest time - scale of the coherent evolution , given by the smallest energy difference , and the dissipative time - scale , determined by the coupling rates @xmath68 , are well - separated , i.e. , @xmath69 for all @xmath36 and @xmath70 .",

    "within such a diagonal ansatz , it is possible to solve both master equations analytically and , moreover , to provide a closed expression for the respective stationary current .      in the interaction - free case ,",
    "the stationary state is found by inserting the rwa ansatz @xmath74 into equation ; after some algebra , we find @xmath75 thus , the populations are determined by an average over the fermi functions , where the weights @xmath76 are given by the overlap of the eigenstate @xmath46 with the site coupled to lead @xmath36 .",

    "then , the molecular orbitals are delocalised which provides ideal transport along the molecule . for a voltage which is sufficiently large such that all molecular orbitals lie within the voltage window ,",
    "the current is in the interaction - free case dominated by the total transmission . under the assumption that all overlaps between molecule eigenstates and sites @xmath7 are identical , we find @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , the rwa current formula becomes @xmath88 in particular , we find that the current is independent of the wire length which is characteristic for coherent transport of non - interacting electrons through an open conduction channel  @xcite .",

    "the bridge levels @xmath97 , @xmath98 , lie @xmath99 above the chemical potential .",
    "let us first discuss the eigenstates of the molecule which discern into two groups : one group of states is located on the bridge .",
    "it consists of @xmath100 levels with energies in the range @xmath101 $ ] . in the absence of the driving field ,",
    "these bridge states mediate the super - exchange between the donor and the acceptor .",

    "thereby , we have worked out the differences to the case of non - interacting electrons . a model for which all on - site energies are identical , represents a tight - binding version of an open conduction channel . there , we find a significant influence of coulomb repulsion : while in the absence of interaction , the current is length independent , it decreases due to coulomb repulsion proportional to the wire length .",
    "thus it resembles an ohmic conductor even though the transport is fully coherent .    for the bridged molecular wire model , only the first and the last site have energies close to the chemical potentials of the leads , whereas all the other sites merely mediate co - tunnelling .",
    "we have demonstrated that then the wire exhibits the behaviour of a two - level system with an effective tunnel matrix element . in particular",
    ", we found the surprising effect that coulomb blocking enhances the current by a factor two .    comparing the results for the open - channel model and the bridge model",
    ", we can conclude that the influence of coulomb repulsion depends sensitively on the level structure of the molecule : if many unoccupied molecular orbitals have energies close to the chemical potentials of the leads , electron - electron interaction reduces the current considerably .",
