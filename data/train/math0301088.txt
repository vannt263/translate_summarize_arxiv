    "resultants have a long history going back to bzout in the eighteenth century .",
    "this algebraic construction received a renewed interest in the last decade with many new contributions and extensions .",
    "generalized resultant is now a major tool in elimination theory , both for theoretical and practical purposes @xcite .    in the homogeneous case ,",
    "a generalized resultant is a closed formula which answer a problem of the following kind  : let @xmath1 be an irreducible projective variety in @xmath2 , @xmath3 be parameters , and @xmath4,  ,@xmath5 be @xmath6 homogeneous polynomials in @xmath7 .",
    "a resultant , if it exists , is a polynomial in @xmath8 , called @xmath9 , such that @xmath10 most of the works in the subject focus on the case @xmath11 .",
    "however the first author studied in its phd thesis @xcite ( see also @xcite ) _ determinantal _ resultants which can be used for some cases with @xmath12 .",
    "motivated by applications in cad ( computer aided design ) we now go further in this direction .",
    "indeed , a major problem in cad is the efficient computation of the intersection of two algebraic surface patches in @xmath13 given by parameterizations .",
    "a popular strategy is to first determine the implicit representation of one of the two surfaces , therefore implicitization techniques based on generalized resultants have been developed , including sparse resultants .",
    "unfortunately , they bring up to the difficult question of the description of the base points of the parameterization @xcite .    the second author proposed in @xcite to compute only a semi - implicit representation of a parameterized surface , which is much easier .",
    "the next step in this approach requires an algebraic closed formula condition for the intersection of two space curves , one given implicitly and the other one given by a parameterization .    in this paper",
    "we build resultant techniques to get original and quite complete answers to that question and to similar ones .",
    "we think that some of our results can lead to efficient and precise procedures of practical interest , other ones have only a theoretical interest .",
    "we tried to keep the paper understandable by a large audience of readers .",
    "however the general idea developed here is more easily expressed using homological algebra and algebraic geometry .",
    "we have explicited the computations in important special cases , and we provided bounds on size and degrees of the expressions .",
    "the paper is divided in four sections organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the application from which emerged our question . in section 3",
    "one recalls some basic definitions and the homological technique we will use for our developments .",
    "we present our main new tool the determinantal resultant in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we prove several propositions and theorems which provide an answer , for each case , to our computational question ; this last section ends with a simple example on which we illustrate our different algorithms .",
    "an important question in computer geometric aided design is to compute precisely and efficiently the intersection of two patches of algebraic surfaces given by rational parametrizations . in @xcite",
    ", we noted that it is much easier to represent one of the two patches by a family of implicitly defined curves than to compute an implicitization of the whole surface .",
    "this technique has for instance the advantage , among others , to avoid the difficulties coming from the base points when implicitizing . by generic flatness , except for few curves , this implicitization step can be done in an uniform way for all curves .",
    "we called that process semi - implicit representation of a parameterized surface . moreover in many cases of interest for the applications , these curves have extra algebraic properties such as being determinantal .",
    "so we are led to an apparently simpler question but in a relative setting ( i.e. on top of a product of one dimensional spaces ) : detect when two space curves intersect .",
    "the answer to this question defines a curve in a two dimensional space , so in theory it can be given by a generalized resultant .",
    "providing such a resultant is the target of this paper .",
    "the fact that we obtain this equation via a resultant is a guaranty of a good numerical stability of the output .",
    "moreover we can keep the result as a compact straight line program made by computation of some minors .",
    "once we have this equation , the work for solving the cagd problem can be finished by ( certified ) numerical computations .",
    "these numerical computations will lift the obtained real curve to a real curve in the four dimensional space where live the parameters of the input parametrized surfaces .",
    "this section is devoted to some known results about multigraded resultants .",
    "our aim is here to recall the ( co)homological techniques , that we will heavily use in section [ resultant ] ; they were introduced in @xcite to study these resultants via determinants of complexes .",
    "as particular cases we recover the well - known sylvester and dixon resultants .      given a finite complex of free @xmath14-modules , where @xmath14 is a factorial regular noetherian integral domain , which is generically exact ( that is exact after tensorization by the field of fractions of @xmath14 ) , we can associate to it a _ determinant _ ( also called macrae s invariant ) which measures the part of its homology supported in codimension 1 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite appendix a for the general definition and properties . in this paper",
    "we will only need to compute determinants of complexes in the simple case of four - term exact complexes of finite - dimensional vector spaces .",
    "we recall a known method , going back to cayley @xcite , to do this .",
    "suppose that we have a four - term exact complex of vector spaces @xmath15 since @xmath16 is surjective , @xmath17 decomposes into @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "now , since @xmath21 , @xmath22 decomposes into @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "finally since @xmath26 is injective and @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the determinant of the complex is then obtained as the quotient @xmath30 , and is independent of choices we made .",
    "note that if @xmath31 , we can make the same decomposition which shows that the determinant of is a quotient of the form @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , when moreover @xmath33 , we recover the standard notion of determinant since the determinant of is then the determinant of the map @xmath16 .",
    "we recall results about classical resultants in the context of multigraded homogeneous polynomials , that is to say polynomials which are homogeneous in sets of variables .",
    "let @xmath34 be positive integers , and let @xmath35 be @xmath36 sets of variables consisting respectively in @xmath37 variables @xmath38 , for all @xmath39 .",
    "we denote by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , the vector space of multi - homogeneous polynomials defined over the variety @xmath42 of multi - degree @xmath43 , that is to say polynomials in the ring @xmath44 $ ] which are homogeneous of degree @xmath45 in the set of variables @xmath46 for all @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath47 , and fix @xmath48 sequences @xmath49 , each consisting of @xmath36 strictly positive integers .",
    "there exists an irreducible polynomial in @xmath50 $ ] ( unique up to sign ) , called the _ multigraded resultant _ on @xmath1 of type @xmath51 and denoted by @xmath52 , such that , for all @xmath53uple @xmath54 , @xmath55 the existence of this polynomial follows from @xcite section 5 ( see also @xcite for a different presentation ) .",
    "it is known to be multi - homogeneous of degree @xmath56 in each vector space @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the integers @xmath56 are determined by the intersection formula @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the first chern class ( explicit formulas are given in @xcite ) .",
    "the technique used in @xcite to define and study this resultant is very powerful to derive explicit formulas , it can be summarized as follows .",
    "the vanishing of the multigraded resultant expresses a failure of a complex of sheaves to be exact .",
    "this allows to construct a class of complexes of finite - dimensional vector spaces whose determinants are the resultant . to every collection of polynomials",

    "[ det ] let @xmath69 be any invertible sheaf on @xmath1 .",
    "if for all @xmath66 and all integer @xmath71 the cohomology groups @xmath72 vanish , then @xmath73 equals the determinant of the complex of global sections of @xmath74 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath75 a sequence @xmath76 , and by @xmath77 the complex of global sections of @xmath78 .",
    "its first differential on the far right is naturally identified with the ( generically surjective ) map @xmath79  : @xmath80 as a consequence of being the determinant of @xmath77 , we have the corollary ( see @xcite theorem 34 )  :    [ gcd ] under the hypothesis of proposition [ det ] , the multigraded resultant @xmath73 equals the gcd of all the determinants of the square minors of size @xmath81 of the map .    in fact",
    "the hypothesis needed in proposition [ det ] ( and corollary [ gcd ] ) is purely combinatorial , for we know ( see for instance @xcite theorem iii.5.1 ) that for all @xmath82 , @xmath83 and any @xmath84 , the cohomology group @xmath85 this property gives a systematic way to deduce which integers @xmath70 are valid for a given multigraded resultant type .",
    "we illustrate this technique with the two following examples of the well - known sylvester and dixon resultants and refer to @xcite for a more systematic and detailed use of these tools to find formulas for general multigraded resultants .",

    "such a resultant was first studied by sylvester , it corresponds to the polynomial in @xmath93 $ ] we have denoted @xmath94 , and is called the sylvester resultant .",
