    "within the single - parameter scaling hypothesis @xcite the dimensionless conductance @xmath2 as a function of system size @xmath3 determines the transport properties of noninteracting electrons in a random potential ( for a review , see kramer and mackinnon @xcite ) . in one - dimensional disordered systems all states are localized @xcite and the conductance @xmath2 decreases exponentially @xcite with increasing sample size @xmath3 .",
    "the localization length @xmath0 can be derived from the asymptotic behavior of the conductance @xmath2 using the relation @xmath4 the localization length @xmath0 and the ljapunov exponent @xmath5 are self - averaging , i.e. non - random quantities @xcite whereas the distribution function of the conductance is approximately log normal @xcite . in the weak disorder limit characterized by a small fermi wavelength compared to the scattering length @xmath6 the localization length @xmath0 is given by the mean free path @xmath6 for backward scattering @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the localization of a composite particle with internal degrees of freedom . as a model we consider a single pair of two particles in a weak one - dimensional white noise potential .",
    "we restrict our considerations to the limit of two tightly bound constituents so that the pair does not decay during its motion through the disorder potential . considering the semiclassical limit the kinetic energy of the center of mass motion",
    "is assumed to be larger than the typical energy of the disorder potential .",
    "typical length scales of our model include the mean free paths @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the pair for backward and forward scattering , respectively .",
    "the scattering processes cause a transfer of kinetic energy of the center of mass motion to the relative motion within the pair and vice versa . therefore ,",
    "the scattering lengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 depend on the structure of the pair , i.e. on the interaction potential between the constituents .",
    "thus one expects that the pair localization length @xmath0 also depends on the shape of the attractive pair potential .    as another but different example for the interplay between interaction and disorder many recent papers study the coherent propagation of two interacting particles ( tip ) in a one - dimensional random potential ( see @xcite and the literature cited there ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the tip model considers the propagation of two repulsing or weakly attracting particles which form a pair due to the scattering by the disordered potential .",
    "the size of the pair is of the order of the one particle localization length @xmath6 . as shepelyansky @xcite and imry @xcite argued , attractive as well as repulsive interaction between the particles cause a localization length of the pair which is much larger than the single particle localization length . in the present work",
    ", we study two particles with strong interaction which form bound states and have a size that is much smaller than the one particle localization length .",
    "for that reason the tip model and the composite particle model studied in this work consider different limiting cases , which are not directly comparable .",
    "moreover , in the mentioned tip approach a lattice model of two particles interacting at one lattice site is considered .",
    "generally the coherent motion of the interacting pair is studied only in the middle of the band ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , we study a continuum model of two interacting particles in the semiclassical regime with a fermi wavelength much smaller than the scattering length ( @xmath10 ) .    a composite particle with @xmath1 bound states may be considered as an @xmath1-channel problem for the center of mass motion . on the other hand",
    "the motion of a single electron in a thick wire is also a multichannel problem since the transversal motion is quantized . in the thick wire",
    "the scattering processes between different channels are random and of the same strength .",
    "the localization length @xmath0 of the wire increases with the channel number @xmath1 as @xmath11 because effectively only one of these channels gives rise to coherent backward scattering and produces localization @xcite . in our composite particle model",
    "the scattering processes between different bound states are also random . however , in contrast to the model of a thick wire , the scattering probabilities depend strongly on the channel numbers .",
    "therefore it is interesting to investigate the localization length in the composite particle model and compare the results for @xmath0 of both different models .",
    "the model of two particles with strong attractive interaction might be relevant for the coulomb - correlated electron - hole pairs in disordered semiconductors .",
    "recent work @xcite has dealt with the dynamics of the electron - hole pair in a 1d model . another physical problem which can be related to",
    "the model we consider below is the superconductor - isolator transition . in order to study the effects of interaction and disorder , lages and shepelyansky @xcite",
    "investigated numerically the cooper problem of two quasiparticles with attractive interaction above a frozen fermi sea in the presence of disorder .",
    "the basic ideas of the model we consider were introduced by dorokhov @xcite .",
    "he studied a pair of particles bound by a harmonic oscillator potential in a weak random disorder potential . for this very special interaction he found a dominant forward scattering in the case of many relevant bound states @xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) employing the specific properties of the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions .",
    "moreover , the pair scattering length @xmath7 was shown to be on the order of the single particle mean free path @xmath6 and independent of the strength of the oscillator potential . using the fact that the forward scattering is the dominant process the pair localization length @xmath13 was calculated .",
    "our results show that dorokhov s conclusions are generic for any attractive interaction potential in the case of many bound states @xmath14 regardless of its shape .",
    "we extend the method @xcite from the harmonic oscillator potential to an arbitrary attractive interaction potential .",
    "this can be accomplished since the excited states of the relative motion within the pair can be described in the semiclassical approximation .",
    "we show that the specific properties of the harmonic oscillator wave functions ( in @xcite the result was obtained using the recurrence relations of the hermitian polynomials ) are of no importance in the multi - channel case . using wkb wave functions for the bound states of the pair we estimate the scattering matrix elements and the mean free paths @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the case @xmath14 .",
    "we find that @xmath15 for any interaction potential .",
    "we also show that @xmath7 is qualitatively independent of the interaction . for the localization length @xmath0",
    "we obtain @xmath16 which implies that @xmath0 is also independent of the interaction .",
    "in addition to the considerations for many bound states @xmath14 we also investigate the first nontrivial case of a small number of bound states , namely @xmath17 .",
    "for a single particle in a random white noise potential the mean free paths @xmath7 and @xmath8 are equal .",
    "we show that already for a pair with only two bound states , the forward scattering is enhanced relative to the backward scattering and that the ratio @xmath18 depends sensitively on the energy .",
    "finally we derive an exact expression for the localization length of the pair with two accessible bound states .",
    "in contrast to earlier treatments @xcite of this problem we do not have to impose any additional restrictions to the scattering matrix elements . therefore , our solution allows to study the influcence of the two particle interaction on the localization directly .",
    "the result indicates that no simple relation exists between @xmath0 and the mean free path of the pair @xmath7 as it was in the limit of many channels @xmath14 . as an application of our general result we present numerical calculations showing that the localization length @xmath0 depends sensitively on the interaction potential , the symmetry of the bound state wave functions and the total energy of the pair .",

    "the size of the box and a total energy shift for the harmonic oscillator potential were adjusted so that the energy levels @xmath188 entering ( [ l_c : n=2 ] ) are at the same position .",
    "this approach ensures that all direct energy dependencies of the localization length have the same structure for either interaction type . the energy window for the @xmath17 case",
    "is then given by @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) for the harmonic oscillator ( box - like potential ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : u_bereich ] .",
    "= 0.47    the next step is to evaluate the matrix elements @xmath161 and @xmath162 as given by ( [ w_nm : alpha , beta ] ) and ( [ w_nm ] ) . inserting these matrix elements in ( [ l_c : n=2 ] ) gives the result for the localization length @xmath191 which is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_c_symm ] .",
    "the interaction between the constituents of the composed particle clearly causes a delocalization compared to the single particle with no internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the reason is that the finite size of the pair effectively smoothes out the disorder .",
    "however , this delocalization effect sensitively depends on the total energy @xmath33 and the type of the two particle interaction .",
    "the resonance in the case of the box - like potential is clearly more pronounced .",
    "if the energy is close to this resonance , i.e. @xmath192 , the delocalization effect differs by a factor @xmath193 due to the different interaction potentials .",
    "= 0.47    furthermore , we have examined the ratio between forward and backward scattering @xmath194 as a function of the energy . as fig .",
    "[ fig : l_bf ] indicates , the forward scattering relative to the backward scattering is already for just two channels enhanced .",
    "although the ratio @xmath18 depends on the energy this effect holds true for the entire energy window accessible for the two channel case .",
    "the suppression of the backward scattering is because the finite size of the pair reduces scattering processes with large momentum transfer as can be concluded from eqs .",
    "( [ w_nm : alpha , beta ] , [ w_nm ] ) .",
    "this effect is even more pronounced if many channels are open , a fact that is of importance for the solution of the multi - channel case , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ multi - channel ] .",
    "= 0.47    using the sum rule ( [ avg.l_n ] ) we calculate the length scale @xmath195 of the transmission eigenvalue of the second internal channel .",
    "it is given by @xmath196 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : l_c1_symm ] .",
    "we find that the ratio @xmath197 is smaller than @xmath198 over the entire energy range for either interaction potential .",
    "this justifies the assumption that the transmission is mainly due to one internal channel if the system is large , i.e. @xmath199 , because of the exponential dependence of the transmission amplitudes on the system size .",
    "= 0.47    finally we compute the localization length for the situation where the two bound states are of odd parity .",
    "again , the parameters of the interaction potentials are fixed such that the energies of the two involved energy levels coincide for the different interaction potentials .",
    "the resulting localization length is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_c_anti ] .",
    "there is a significant difference between the localization lengths in the case of wave functions with even parity compared to odd parity . for the harmonic oscillator potential",
    "there is a sharp resonance near the lower limit @xmath200 of the energy window in the second case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : l_c_anti ] ) while the first case shows a smooth behavior with a weak resonance in the middle of the energy range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : l_c_symm ] ) . for the @xmath185 interaction the resonance position and height also changes significantly . since the energy levels are shifted to the same position for either case the differences result only from the different structure of the bound state wave functions .",
    "the largest delocalization effect occurs for @xmath185 for the states of odd parity and is about @xmath201 at the resonance .",
    "in this work we have studied the localization of a pair of two bound particles in a one - dimensional system with weak disorder .",
    "the interaction potential within this composite particle is fully taken into account within the semiclassical approximation .",
    "our results are based on a method introduced by dorokhov for two particles bound by a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "we have generalized the method from this special interaction potential to an arbitrary attractive interaction .",
    "this allows us to analyze the dependence of the pair localization on the interaction .",
    "we find an enhancement of the pair localization length @xmath0 in comparison to the single particle mean free path @xmath6 .",
    "this enhancement is independent of the form of the pair interaction potential in the limit of many bound states @xmath14 .",
    "it is given by @xmath202 as can be seen from the central result ( [ final_result : l_c ] ) in conjunction with ( [ wkb : l_b , result ] ) .",
    "furthermore we derived an exact solution for the two channel case @xmath17 . for a bound pair with @xmath203",
    "we observe a sensitive dependence of the localization length ( [ l_c : n=1 ] ) , ( [ l_c : n=2 ] ) on the shape of the interaction potential , the parity of the involved bound states and the kinetic energy of the pair .",
    "we expect that such a behavior is typical for bound pair with a small number of bound states .",
    "the approach described in this work is valid for two identical particles .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to extend the method without difficulties to a pair of different particles ( e.g. electron - hole pair ) . in this case",
    ", the expression for the matrix elements ( [ w_nm ] ) has to be modified taking into account that the random potential and the mass may be different for the two particles .",
    "however , the described method can not be extended to a repulsing interaction because the assumption that the pair size is smaller than the mean free path breaks down .",
