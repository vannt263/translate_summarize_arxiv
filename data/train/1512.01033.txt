    "the observed finite resolution is the result of a nonlinear behaviour of the device , a non - optimal cryogenic amplification stage and a small series ohmic resistance , caused by unexpectedly low - quality silver epoxy joints .",
    "surprisingly , in @xmath0he the resonance lineshape was nonlinear even for rather low velocities ( corresponding to small maximum displacements ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "nonlinearity makes the measurements tedious : complete frequency sweeps have to be measured for each excitation in order to prevent bistable switchings and truncated datasets .",
    "furthermore , because of the smallness of the displacement amplitudes , the detected signal is also rather small .",

    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "when the lineshape is nonlinear , the dissipation can not be inferred from a linewidth measurement . however , the simple relation between height @xmath21 and linewidth parameter @xmath8 still holds , and it is thus possible to infer the linear dissipation coefficient ( in units of hertz ) by measuring the maximum height of the resonance peak @xcite . but",
    "no convincing full fit of the raw data , fig .  [ fig4 ] , could be produced because the source of the nonlinearity is not yet clearly identified .",

    "we can only speculate about the source of the nonlinearity",
    ". it could be the signature of the inertial nonlinear component which should accompany the nonlinear damping of quasiparticles , or quasiparticle emission or turbulence nucleation .",
    "one would need a quantitative estimate of these effects to compare with fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , and explain its origin . at present , the simplest fit to fig .  [ fig5 ] that can be produced is obtained via a nonlinear duffing - like inertial term of the type @xmath34 replacing the mode mass @xmath35 .",

    "[ fig5 ] ( full line ) by the relation : @xmath38 .",
    "we extract for the nonlinear mass @xmath39kg/(ms@xmath2)@xmath40 .",
    "interestingly , rather different frequency - softening nonlinear features were reported at ultra - low temperatures on a conventional vibrating wire , and at the time were interpreted as the interplay between the wire and the @xmath0he - b texture@xcite .",
    "he - b ( see legend ) .",
    "the dashed vertical marks the pair - breaking velocity . below pair - breaking , the fit is a simple quadratic duffing law with @xmath41hz / m@xmath40 . above the pair - breaking limit ,",
    "the line is a guide to the eyes .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents the geometrical ( and positive ) quadratic duffing fit from fig .",
    "[ fig4bis ] . ]",
    "we have measured in superfluid @xmath0he at ultra - low temperatures the damping due to andreev reflection of quasiparticles on a mems goalpost - shaped vibrating - wire like structure .",
    "we demonstrate that the nonlinear damping follows the same model as for vibrating wires , with the same geometrical parameter @xmath42 and a larger @xmath43 .",
    "we thus show that this probe is more sensitive to thermal excitations than other structures immersed in superfluid @xmath0he . mentioning the versatility of microfabrication technologies and the very high vacuum mechanical @xmath9 factors reachable for these structures ( here , above 0.2 million ) , these new probes are to date the best technology for the lowest temperature measurements and highest resolution in bolometric particle detection in superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "however , the critical velocity is much lower than for other conventional structures and a nonlinear behaviour is observed at ultra - low temperature , which we interpret as a nonlinear inertial effect .",
    "further experiments are clearly needed to contrast the onset of extra damping at critical velocity and to understand the nature of non - linearities reported with mems and vibrating wires . in particular , measurements at different fluid densities ( pressures )",
    "should be performed to see how the observed properties scale with superfluid parameters . finally ,",
    "a natural development of this research for the future is to scale down these structures toward nems and see how the superfluid properties are modified when probed on a scale of order @xmath44 .",
