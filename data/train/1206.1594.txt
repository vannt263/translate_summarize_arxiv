    "the initial mass function ( hereafter imf ) is defined as the distribution of stellar masses in a single population at the time of birth .",
    "it has been usually considered a universal function , partly because of the complexities in obtaining proper observational constraints .",
    "the traditional approximation by a single power law @xcite has undergone numerous updates , with more complex functions that include a significant flattening of the slope towards low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "for a recent review on the imf and its possible variations , see @xcite .     with the spectral resolution of sdss , and continuum subtracted with a second order polynomial .",
    "we only show , for clarity , three out of the 18 stacks , spanning the full range of velocity dispersion .",
    "the shaded regions mark the positions of the red and blue sidebands , and the central bandpass .",
    "[ fig : stacks ] , width=283 ]    past analyses based on dynamical modelling favoured kroupa - like imfs in etgs @xcite .",
    "this result was also found with strong gravitational lensing on the bulge of a late - type galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , the imf was suspected to depend on galaxy mass , when extending the analysis to more massive systems , as in the dynamical modelling of @xcite , with galaxy morphology also playing a role @xcite .",
    "constraining the low - mass portion of the imf is a challenging task , as faint , low - mass stars do not contribute significantly to the integrated spectrum .",
    "the first observational attempts to constrain the low - mass end of the imf were made by @xcite and @xcite , towards the centers of m31 and m32 , measuring several spectral features sensitive to the relative contribution of m dwarves and m giants .",
    "later , @xcite extended the study to a sample of massive early - type galaxies , and found that nai was enhanced , especially in massive galaxies , with strong radial gradients ( being most enhanced in the central region ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite proposed a relation towards an excess of low - mass stars in massive galaxies , from a study of the caii triplet region at @xmath68500 .",
    "@xcite probed two features in the nir that are strongly dependent on the fraction of low - mass stars , to find a bottom - heavy imf in a sample of four virgo etgs .",
    "this result was recently extended to an additional set of 34 etgs from the sauron survey , with similar conclusions @xcite , favouring the interpretation of a non - universal imf .",
    "an alternative scenario to explain these data would invoke over / under abundances of individual elements ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "bottom - heavy imfs would imply that massive galaxies observed at high redshift are even more massive than the standard assumption of a kroupa - like imf , posing challenging constraints on the physics underlying the conversion of gas into stars during the first stages of galaxy formation .",
    "this issue is of special relevance to the standard paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation , whereby massive galaxies are supposed to grow mainly through the merging of smaller systems , with the growth rate limited by cosmology ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requiring alternative channels of massive galaxy formation , such as cold accretion ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "simple theories of star formation suggest a power law behaviour , with a truncation at the low - mass end , around 0.3m@xmath7@xcite , consistent with some of the most popular imfs used @xcite .",
    "however , due to the lack of strong observable tracers in the observed spectra arising from low mass stars , a robust constraint at the low - mass end of the imf has remained elusive for years .",
    "in addition to the work cited above , more recent evidence has been accumulating @xcite , towards the possibility of a non - universal imf .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by an independent study that made use of detailed dynamical modelling of nearby spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "strong gravitational lensing over galaxy scales also hint at bottom heavy imfs in massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "the implications of a change in the imf warrant further analysis of this problem .    with the spectral response of sdss .",
    "the error bars give the statistical error from the stacks , at the @xmath8 level .",
    "the shaded regions on the right correspond to model predictions for three choices of imf unimodal slope , as labelled , spanning a range of ages from @xmath9 to @xmath10gyr and metallicity from @xmath11 to @xmath12 [ fig : ews],width=283 ]",
    "the hypothesis of a systematic change in the initial stellar mass function with respect to global properties of galaxies , such as mass or luminosity , are optimally tested on samples of galaxies that harbour stellar populations as homogenous as possible , for a clean analysis of the spectra . the spider sample ( spheroids panchromatic investigation in different environmental regions , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is optimal for this purpose , as it comprises 39,993 nearby ( 0.05@xmath13z@xmath130.095 ) etgs , in a wide range of masses , from @xmath14 to @xmath15m@xmath7(dynamical mass , * ? ? ?",
    "spectra of these galaxies were retrieved from the sixth data release of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite ( sdss ) , de - redshifted to a common rest - frame ( with 1  binning ) and corrected for foreground galactic extinction ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . in order to test variations of the imf",
    ", we assemble 18 stacked spectra spanning over a wide range of central velocity dispersions ( @xmath16 ) between 100 and 320kms@xmath3  in steps of 10kms@xmath3 , except for the two bins for the highest values of @xmath16 , where  because of the smaller number of galaxies in the sample  we adopted the range [ 260,280 ] , and [ 280,320]kms@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we select the sample according to @xmath16 , because ( i ) the underlying stellar populations of etgs are known to correlate strongly with this observable @xcite , and ( ii ) the spectral analysis depends sensitively on velocity dispersion , as a higher @xmath16 introduces an effectively lower spectral resolution , an issue that we take into account for a consistent comparison ( see below ) .",
    "given the redshift range of the spider sample , the 3  arcsec diameter of the sdss fibers maps the central @xmath17kpc . for each bin , we perform median stacking of the available spectra , considering only pixels with no sdss flag raised . in order to avoid possible biases related to intrinsic dust and differences in signal to noise ratio ( @xmath18 ) within the bin ,",
    "we excluded spectra in the lowest quartile of the @xmath18 distribution , as well as those galaxies ( @xmath19 of the entire sample ) with @xmath20  mag . the colour excess is measured by fitting each sdss spectrum with a variety of stellar population models , assuming a  @xcite extinction law , as detailed in  @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectral range allows us to study several imf - sensitive spectral features , such as the nai doublet at @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "this feature is prominent in the atmospheres of low - mass dwarf stars .",
    "therefore , its strength in a stellar population depends quite sensitively on the shape of the imf at the low - mass end . over the imf - sensitive wavelength range ( 81838195 ) ,",
    "our stacked spectra feature a remarkably high @xmath18 , with an average of @xmath22 per  for the lowest and highest @xmath16 bins , reaching values as high as @xmath23 per   in the stack with velocity dispersion @xmath24kms@xmath3 .",
    "we use here a slightly modified version of the nai8200a index proposed by @xcite , defined as na8190 , where the blue passband is measured in the [ 8137,8147]  interval ( instead of [ 8164,8173] ) , where the miuscat models are found to give a better match to the data , within @xmath25 ( compared to @xmath26 at @xmath27 ) .",
    "the red and central bandpasses are the same as for the nai8200a index .",
    "we performed extensive tests to check for possible contamination of the na8190 feature from sky lines , by combining ( 1 ) all galaxies at each @xmath28 regardless of the sdss flag value ; ( 2 ) only flux values not affected by sky absorption ( i.e. 1  apart from any telluric line ) and sky emission ; and ( 3 ) only etgs at the lowest redshifts in the spider sample ( @xmath29 ) , where the nai doublet is observed in a region free from any significant sky contamination . for all @xmath16 bins , the variation of the average nai flux , using the above three stacking procedures , was found to be smaller than @xmath30 , i.e. negligible for our purposes .    in order to increase the robustness of the analysis against possible biases regarding an overabundance of [ na / fe ] in massive galaxies , we also consider two line strengths targeting tio , a further discriminant with respect to the presence of low - mass stars .",
    "we use the tio1 and tio2 definitions from the standard lick system ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the tio2 index has been recently used by @xcite to constrain the imf of a number of early - type gravitational lenses .",
    "[ fig : stacks ] shows three of our 18 stacks , in the regions of interest for this work .",
    "all seds have been smoothed to a common velocity dispersion of 300kms@xmath3  for a consistent comparison , and were continuum subtracted , using a second order polynomial .",
    "a significant trend is apparent from low- to high - velocity dispersion of all indices .",
    "this trend encodes a complex range of variations in the underlying stellar populations , most notably age , metallicity , abundance ratios , and imf .",
    "note in the na8190 region ( _ bottom _ ) , the centroid of the line shifts bluewards as @xmath16 increases .",
    "however , because of the asymmetry of the spectral region around the line , more flux would be expected to contribute from the red side of the line , therefore shifting the position of the centroid redwards .",
    "this shifting reveals that it is the absorption of na at 8190   and not other contaminating lines in the vicinity  that changes with respect to the velocity dispersion of the etg .",
    "the two most obvious interpretations of this effect involve either an overabundance of [ na / fe ] @xcite , or a change in the imf @xcite . in a forthcoming paper ( la barbera et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we explore in detail the effect of individual overabundances .",

    "the strengths are corrected to a common broadening of @xmath31300kms@xmath3(in addition to the wavelength - dependent sdss resolution ) .",
    "a strong correlation of these line strengths with velocity dispersion is evident .",
    "we checked that the fixed aperture of the fibres used by sdss to retrieve spectra did not introduce a bias with respect to size , by comparing the change in line strengths with respect to the angular extent of the effective radius .",
    "the variation of the indices , at fixed @xmath16 , is around an order of magnitude smaller than the trend shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ews ] .",
    "the shaded regions on the right of the figure motivate the methodology followed in this paper .",
    "each one gives the model predictions for a choice of unimodal imf slope ( labelled ) , over a range of ssp ages and metallicities .",
    "the values of all three indices at high velocity dispersion can only be reconciled with a bottom - heavy imf .",
    "our methodology  explained below  consists of removing the degeneracies from age and metallicity by combining line strength information with spectral fitting over the optical range .",
    "we make use of miuscat @xcite , the spectrally extended version of the stellar population synthesis models miles @xcite , in order to map the systematic trend of the tio1 , tio2 and na8190 line strengths with respect to imf slope .",
    "these models combine state - of - the art stellar libraries in the optical and nir windows , creating a set of spectra with a uniform resolution of 2.51  throughout the wavelength range 34659469  .",
    "our data are compared with grids of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) , assuming either a unimodal or a bimodal imf ( as defined in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , over a stellar mass range @xmath32m@xmath7 .",
    "for the unimodal case , we adopt the logarithmic slope @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the initial mass function , such that the @xcite imf corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "a bimodal imf replaces the @xmath36 interval by a flat portion and a spline to match the power law at the high mass end .",
    "it gives a closer representation of kroupa - like imfs for @xmath37 ( see , e.g. figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "we use miuscat ssps spanning a wide range of ages ( 113  gyr ) and metallicities ( @xmath38 ) , for different values of @xmath39 . in order to obtain an accurate estimate of @xmath16 for each stack",
    ", we perform spectral fitting with the software starlight @xcite , in the range 38008400 .",
    "starlight can be used to extract full star formation histories ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we are only interested here in assessing the robustness of the measured @xmath16 with respect to the basis ssps .",
    "we find no significant trend when choosing template ssps with different imfs , with a variation @xmath401kms@xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , for each stack , the @xmath16 determined by starlight is consistent , within @xmath41 , with the median @xmath16 of the stacked spectra from sdss .",
    "we parameterise a stellar population by an age , metallicity , and imf slope .",
    "more detailed models will be presented elsewhere ( la barbera et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we note that , according to @xcite , both tio1 and tio2 are rather insensitive to non - solar abundance ratios",
    ". furthermore , @xcite find an anticorrelation between [ @xmath4/fe ] and nai0.82 strength ( similar to our na8190 index ) .",
    "hence , we do not expect our results , regarding the non - universality of the imf , to be affected by the well - known overabundance of [ @xmath4/fe ] in massive galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to confirm this point , we studied two subsamples within the highest-@xmath16 bin , split with respect to the distribution of [ @xmath4/fe ] values , constructing low-(@xmath42 ) and high-(@xmath43 ) [ @xmath4/fe ] stacks .",
    "the measured tio1(mag)/tio2(mag)/na8190( ) strengths are @xmath44 / @xmath45 / @xmath46 , for the high [ @xmath4/fe ] subsample , @xmath47 / @xmath48 / @xmath49 , for the low [ @xmath4/fe ] subsample , which is fully consistent with the original stack , including all values of [ @xmath4/fe ] : @xmath50 / @xmath51 / @xmath52 .",
    "our analysis follows a hybrid method , whereby two independent probability distribution functions for age , metallicity and imf slope are obtained using spectral fitting and line strengths , respectively . for the former",
    ", we fit the region 39005400  , using ssps from miuscat , after convolving them from the original 2.51  resolution , to the fiducial velocity dispersion of 300kms@xmath3 , plus sdss spectral resolution . a grid of @xmath53 models in age , log z and @xmath54 is used to obtain a probability distribution function ( pdf ) , via the likelihood @xmath55 .",
    "for each line strength , we also define a second pdf in the same grid .",
    "the joint pdf is defined as the product of the corresponding ( independent ) pdfs .",
    "finally , we marginalize over all parameters but @xmath54 , to obtain the pdf of the imf slope . fig .",
    "[ fig : specfit ] illustrates the constraining power of the different observables , individually , on the age and metallicity of the model ssp .",

    "[ fig : ews ] motivates the need to invoke a non - universal imf when comparing galaxies over a range of velocity dispersions , with an increased contribution from low - mass stars in the most massive galaxies .",
    "[ fig : imf ] presents the best - fit slope of the imf , when marginalizing over age and metallicity , as a function of velocity dispersion , given by the probability weighted estimates using the joint pdf , for three cases , depending on whether tio1 ( filled circles ) , tio2 ( open squares ) , or na8190 ( crosses ) are used in the analysis .",
    "both unimodal ( _ top _ ) and bimodal ( _ bottom _ ) imfs are considered .",
    "we note that at low velocity dispersion , the constraint on imf slope becomes more challenging , as low - mass etgs feature complex star formation histories ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making the ssp approach used here not fully applicable . therefore , fig .",
    "[ fig : imf ] only shows the range 150300kms@xmath3 , where the approximation of a ssp is justified .",
    "the general trend towards a bottom - heavy imf is evident in all cases .",
    "the result for the joint pdf corresponding to all three indices plus spectral fitting is shown as a grey shaded region  extending over the 68% confidence level  with a black line giving a simple least squares fit to the data .",
    "we emphasize here that accurate values of the imf slope will require a detailed analysis of abundance ratios ( such as , e.g. , [ @xmath4/fe ] or [ na / fe ] ) .",
    "the predicted imf slopes for massive etgs do not pose a problem to optical - nir photometry , where the contribution from low - mass stars would be most important .",
    "as an example , the miuscat models for a 10gyr population at solar metallicity give @xmath56 for a ( bimodal ) imf slope @xmath57 , versus @xmath58 for @xmath59 ( a unimodal distribution will give an excess in @xmath60 of @xmath61mag over a similar range of @xmath54 ) .",
    "hence , a variation in the imf is compatible with the observed @xmath60 colours .",
    "furthermore , @xmath60 colours alone can not be used to constrain the imf , a well - known result , that explains why constraints on the imf have remained elusive .",
    "the @xmath60 colour of our sample ranges from @xmath62 at the lowest velocity dispersion bin , to @xmath63 at a velocity dispersion of 300kms@xmath3@xcite .",

    "[ fig : imf ] should serve as a warning to applications of these trends to infer stellar masses .",
    "the m / l in the sdss - r band is shown for a typical old , metal - rich population , such as those found in these galaxies .",
    "the difference between a unimodal ( _ top _ ) and a bimodal ( _ bottom _ ) imf is very significant for massive galaxies , whereas the fits for either choice of imf are equally acceptable .",
    "the correlation presented in this letter is consistent with studies based on different methods , involving strong gravitational lensing , or dynamical modelling ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . regarding the study of stellar populations , our work is consistent with the trend in @xcite , based on a spectroscopic analysis of the ca ii triplet region .",
    "in addition , the recent _ photometric _ analysis of ( * ? ? ? * see their figure  16 ) , is compatible with our analysis .",
    "our results are also in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that our analysis is based on a completely independent stellar library to their work .",
    "for instance , in the region around the na8190 feature , the miuscat models use stellar spectra from the indo - us library @xcite , whereas the models of @xcite use the irtf library @xcite . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will explore in detail different aspects related to the methodology , including the contribution from enhacements of individual elements , non - solar [ @xmath4/fe ] , or composite stellar populations .",
    "the large size of our sample  comprising nearly 40,000 etgs  allowed us to go beyond a simple test of non - universality of the imf , enabling us to obtain a trend between the imf slope and velocity dispersion in more detail than previously found .",
    "the existing correlation between @xmath54 and velocity dispersion in etgs suggests a significant transition in the properties of star forming regions as a function of galaxy mass , an issue with important implications on galaxy formation theories .    if would like to acknowledge the hospitality of inaf / oac and the iac .",
