    "as is well  known , the mapping class group of a compact surface is finitely generated , thus a metric space .",
    "the purpose of this note is to prove that , after fixing a certain set of generators , in a ball centered at the identity in the pure mapping class group of a four holed sphere ( which is a free group of rank two ) , almost all elements are pseudo  anosov .",
    "more precisely , in a ball with center at the identity , the ratio of the number of pseudo  anosov elements to the number of all elements tends to one as the radius of the ball tends to infinity .",
    "in fact , we prove more : we give the growth series of reducible and of pseudo  anosov elements with respect to a fixed set of generators .",
    "it turns out that the growth functions of these elements are rational .",
    "this gives a partial answer to question 3.13 and verifies conjecture 3.15 in  @xcite in a special case .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finitely generated group with a finite generating set @xmath1 , so that every element of @xmath0 can be written as a product of elements in @xmath2 .",
    "the _ length _ of an element @xmath3 ( with respect to @xmath1 ) is defined as @xmath4 the _ distance _ between two elements @xmath5 and @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 . the function @xmath8 is a metric on @xmath0 , called the _",
    "word metric_. of course , this metric depends heavily on the generating set .",
    "the choice of different generating sets give rise to equivalent metrics .",
    "we will always fix a finite generating set @xmath1 and drop @xmath1 from the notation .    for a subset @xmath9 of @xmath0 ,",
    "the _ growth series _ of @xmath9 relative to the generating set @xmath1 is the formal power series @xmath10 , where the coefficient @xmath11 of @xmath12 is the number of elements of length @xmath13 in @xmath9 .",
    "the _ growth function _ of @xmath9 is the function represented by the growth series . in the mapping class group , we may take @xmath9 to be periodic , reducible or pseudo  anosov elements .",

    "the elements of the group @xmath25 are classified by the traces of the corresponding matrices ; if @xmath20 is an element of @xmath25 , then it is periodic if @xmath27 , reducible if @xmath28 , and anosov if @xmath29 ( cf .",
    "see @xcite ) . in @xcite , takasawa computed the growth series of periodic , reducible and anosov elements of @xmath25 and found their growth functions .",
    "he proved that almost all elements of the mapping class group of the torus are anosov .",
    "that is , with respect to a certain generating set , the ratio of the number of anosov elements to the number of all elements in a ball centered at the identity tends to one as the radius of the ball tends to infinity .",
