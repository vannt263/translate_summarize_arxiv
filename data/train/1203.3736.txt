    "in the context of laser cooling , there has been a resurgence of interest in the strong interactions between rydberg atoms . a key development",
    "was the concept of the dipole blockade , where the strong interaction between rydberg atoms leads to the excitation of collective states with a single rydberg excitation shared between many atoms @xcite .",
    "applications of the dipole blockade include quantum information @xcite , where two - qubit gates have already been demonstrated @xcite , co - operative nonlinear optics @xcite and the physics of strongly correlated systems @xcite .",
    "other important areas of study in cold rydberg gases include the formation of long - range molecules @xcite , and the interplay between rydberg gases and ultracold plasmas @xcite .",
    "central to all of these applications is a detailed understanding of the long - range interactions between rydberg atoms . as most experiments so far have been carried out using the alkali metals ( rb , cs ) , theoretical work has concentrated on these elements @xcite .",
    "both perturbative calculations of the quadrupole - quadrupole and dipole - dipole interactions @xcite and detailed non - perturbative calculations of the dipole - dipole interactions @xcite have been performed .",
    "atoms with two valence electrons offer a new approach , as the inner valence electron provides an additional way to probe and manipulate rydberg atoms .",
    "recent experiments have shown that the inner electron can be used as a fast , state - selective probe of the interactions in a cold rydberg gas @xcite .",
    "the polarizability of the additional electron also enables tight , magic - wavelength traps for rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "rydberg states of sr and yb have also been proposed for high - precision measurements of the black - body shift in optical frequency standards @xcite .",
    "preliminary calculations of the interactions for strontium revealed interesting features that differ from the alkali metals , such as the possibility of an isotropic , attractive interaction potential @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to carry out a systematic study of the interactions between rydberg atoms in the most commonly laser - cooled two - electron systems , i.e. ca , sr and yb . in section [ methods ] we present the background theory for the calculations . the @xmath6 and @xmath7 coefficients governing the strength of the long - range interactions are expressed in terms of angular factors and radial matrix elements .",
    "the latter are evaluated using the coulomb approximation , which requires accurate knowledge of the rydberg energy levels .",
    "we therefore present a detailed review of the available experimental energy levels .",
    "the main results of this paper are @xmath6 and @xmath7 coefficients for all the rydberg series where experimental energy levels are available .",
    "tables of our complete results are provided in the supplementary data . in section [ results ]",
    "we present an overview of these tables , revealing significant differences between the species , and between different spin symmetries ( singlet or triplet ) .",
    "several frster resonances , namely accidental near - degeneracies in pair states of the two atoms causing a large value of the @xmath7 coefficient , are also identified .",
    "we consider two interacting divalent atoms , one in the state @xmath8 and the other in the a state @xmath9 , separated by a distance @xmath10 . specifically , we consider states with high enough principal quantum numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 that effects arising from configuration mixing can be neglected . such effects , e.g. , singlet - triplet mixing in the @xmath13 states of strontium @xcite , can be large in the vicinity of perturbers . however , in the species considered sharp deviations are only observed close to the perturber s energies . when far away from any perturber the rydberg series varies monotonically , thus the effect of a perturber can be incorporated into the quantum defect . for strontium",
    "the perturbers are found much lower in the rydberg series than the states considered here , however two of the rydberg series of calcium and ytterbium are considerably perturbed over a wide range of states .",
    "a single active electron treatment is questionable for the calculating the @xmath6 and @xmath7 coefficients affected by these perturbations .",
    "the effect of these configuration interactions will be considered in future work . here",
    ", we describe each atom by a simple model in which one of the two valence electrons is in an extended rydberg orbital while the other is in a compact inner orbital . denoting by @xmath14 and @xmath15 the position vectors of the valence electrons relative to the nucleus",
    ", we represent the state of each atom by the symmetrized wave function @xmath16 .",
    "\\label{symmetrized}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the subscripts i and o refer to the inner and outer orbitals , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are spinors describing the spin states of electrons @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the wave function of the inner electron , and @xmath22 the wave function of the outer electron .",
    "we assume that the inner orbital is of @xmath23-symmetry ; therefore @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hamiltonian of the pair of atoms at infinite separation and @xmath28 is the interaction energy between the two atoms . in terms of the position vectors of the valence electrons and",
    "the relative position @xmath29 of the two nuclei @xmath30 with the indexes 1 and 2 identifying the respective atoms , and @xmath31 .",
    "( atomic units are used throughout this section ) .",
    "we treat the interaction hamiltonian @xmath28 perturbatively . for long range rydberg - rydberg interactions ,",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath28 between the bound eigenstates of @xmath27 are dominated by the contribution of the two outer electrons .",
    "we can therefore reduce the calculation of the dispersion coefficients to a problem in which each atom has only one active electron and the interaction hamiltonian reduces to @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the position vectors of the two rydberg electrons respective to the corresponding nuclei .",
    "( although each atom has only one active electron , the quantum numbers of the system remain those pertaining to the original multi - electron problem . )",
    "this formulation neglects exchange interactions , which is valid as long as @xmath10 much exceeds the leroy radius @xcite , @xmath35 a similar single active electron treatment has been previously shown to yield accurate stark maps for two - electron rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "expanding @xmath36 in multipoles yields @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the unit vector along the internuclear axis . for infinite atomic separation , the eigenenergies of the hamiltonian @xmath39 coincide with those of @xmath27 , which are sums of energies of unperturbed atomic states .",
    "these asymptotic eigenenergies are thus degenerate in @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "( there is no degeneracy if @xmath42 since in this case the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath40 and @xmath41 can take only one value . )",
    "@xmath36 mixes states of different @xmath43 values and as a result splits the degenerate asymptotic energy levels into a number of sublevels .",
    "each of the latter differs from its @xmath44 limit by a sublevel - specific , @xmath10-dependent shift @xmath45 .",
    "treating @xmath46 perturbatively and making use of the multipolar expansion ( [ multipolarinteraction ] ) leads to an expression of these shifts in the form of a series of inverse powers of @xmath10 , @xmath47 for the systems we are concerned with , this expansion is dominated at large interatomic separations by the term in @xmath48 , when @xmath49 , which arises to first order in @xmath36 from the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction ( @xmath50 in the multipolar expansion of @xmath46 ) , and the term in @xmath51 , which arises to second order from the dipole - dipole interaction ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 coefficients are the eigenvalues of the @xmath53 by @xmath53 matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 formed by the @xmath43-dependent , @xmath38-dependent coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 in these two equations , @xmath58 denotes the sextuple of quantum numbers @xmath59 and @xmath60 the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 are defined in the appendix .",
    "moreover , in equation ( [ c6expression ] ) the sum runs over all the intermediate @xmath63 pair states dipole coupled both to the @xmath64 state and to the @xmath65 state , and @xmath66 denotes the frster defect ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ multipolarinteraction ] ) that @xmath46 only couples pair states of same value of @xmath68 , and that the ensuing energy shifts do not depend on the overall sign of @xmath68 , when the angle @xmath69 between the interatomic axis and the axis of quantization of the angular momenta ( which we take to be the @xmath70-axis ) is zero .",
    "the sublevels the asymptotic energy levels split into are thus characterized by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "( @xmath73 can be recognized as the magnetic quantum number associated with @xmath74 , the @xmath70-component of the total angular momentum operator @xmath75 . ) for other orientations of the interatomic axis , @xmath46 also couples pair states differing in @xmath73 .",
    "however , the choice of the quantization axis is arbitrary and thus the eigenenergies of the system do not depend on @xmath38 : changing the orientation of the interatomic axis changes the composition of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in terms of the unperturbed pair states but does not affect the energy shifts @xmath45",
    ". therefore the dispersion coefficients as defined by equation ( [ cncoeffs ] ) do not depend on @xmath38 and can be obtained by diagonalizing the matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 for any orientation of the interatomic axis .    due to the selection rule mentioned at the beginning of the last paragraph ,",
    "these two matrices are block diagonal when this axis is in the @xmath70-direction , each block being formed by pair states with the same value of @xmath73 .",
    "it follows from the relationships between @xmath73 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 that the linear size of each block , i.e. , the number of values of @xmath6 or @xmath7 associated with each value of @xmath73 , is @xmath79 . in particular , the diagonal blocks with @xmath80 contain only one element . for these values of @xmath73 , the dispersion coefficients are thus given directly by equations ( [ c5expression ] ) and ( [ c6expression ] ) as @xmath81 ( @xmath82 implies that each atom is in a stretched state with @xmath83 and @xmath84 . )    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     llcdddd atom & series & @xmath85 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath86 & fractional error + sr&@xmath87&0&3.2&-0.51&3.6&0.02 + & @xmath88&1&-2.387&1.211&-21.18&0.01 + & @xmath89&1&-1.24&0.0349&1.03&0.002 + & @xmath90&2&-1.65&0.365&-7.05&0.02 + ca&@xmath91&0&-1.793&0.3190&-1.338&0.0001 + yb&@xmath92&0&-9.84&0.0234&-0.421&0.003 + & @xmath93&1&-7.74&0.167&-2.73&0.0009 +      the relative strength of the first - order quadrupole - quadrupole interaction ( @xmath6 ) and the second - order dipole - dipole interaction ( @xmath7 ) is illustrated in figure [ nonpertcomparison ] . as is well known , the @xmath94 term dominates the energy shift at large separation @xmath10 ( for the symmetries for which @xmath95 ) , while the @xmath96 term is significant below a critical radius @xmath97 . how large @xmath98 is depends on the symmetry of the eigenstate and on @xmath99 , see figure [ energydistance ] ( @xmath98 is roughly proportional to @xmath100 ) . for most states , the @xmath96 term dominates the energy shift up to interatomic distances at which this shift is too small to be relevant for experiments .",
    "however for certain symmetries , such as the @xmath101 state represented in the figure , the second order dipole - dipole shift is unusually small due to a vanishing angular factor @xcite .",
    "in this case , the quadrupole interaction may be of significant importance when considering a dipole blockade .    given that the quadrupole interaction can normally be neglected at the atomic densities involved in cold rydberg gases experiments , we consider the @xmath6 coefficients only briefly in the following , before discussing the @xmath7 coefficients in greater detail .     at the critical radius @xmath98 where @xmath102 , for @xmath103 states of strontium .",

    "]      as they depend on the energy levels only through radial matrix elements , the @xmath6 coefficients exhibit less structure than the @xmath7 coefficients , which also depend on the inverse of the frster defect , @xmath108 .",
    "due to selection rules on the orbital angular momentum , the first order quadrupole interaction vanishes for many of the series .",
    "in particular , @xmath109 for @xmath110 .    in general , the @xmath6 coefficient scales with @xmath99 like @xmath111 @xcite .",

    "the corresponding values of @xmath6 tend to arrange themselves evenly about zero , without marked differences between strontium , calcium and ytterbium .    in general ,",
    "most triplet states were found to have weaker quadrupole interactions than the singlet states for the same value of @xmath99 , due to a smaller value of @xmath62 .",
    "first of all , we consider the rydberg series with orbital angular momentum @xmath118 . in alkali metals , the @xmath0 states are widely used in experiments as the interaction is repulsive , which reduces the effect of ionizing interactions , and is nearly independent of @xmath69 .",

    "otherwise , its composition in terms of eigenstates of @xmath135 varies with the angle @xmath69 between the two axes ( figure [ angularstatefraction ] ) .",
    "however , as seen from the figure , the average @xmath7 coefficient varies by less than 10% between @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "this means that there are two nearly - isotropic @xmath0 series in strontium with @xmath7 coefficients of opposite signs , and therefore that the interaction can be tailored to experimental requirements by modifying the excitation scheme for the same atom .",

    "<S> long - range dipole - dipole and quadrupole - quadrupole interactions between pairs of rydberg atoms are calculated perturbatively for calcium , strontium and ytterbium within the coulomb approximation . </S>",
    "<S> quantum defects , obtained by fitting existing laser spectroscopic data , are provided for all @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 series of strontium and for the @xmath4 series of calcium . </S>",
    "<S> the results show qualitative differences with the alkali metal atoms , including isotropically attractive interactions of the strontium @xmath5 states and a greater rarity of frster resonances . </S>",
    "<S> only two such resonances are identified , both in triplet series of strontium . </S>",
