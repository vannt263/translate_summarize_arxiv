    "monopoles are at the heart of various kinds of electric - magnetic duality in extended super yang - mills theory , which have led to an impressive body of quantitative results .",
    "the role of monopoles and other topological constructs in non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory is less clear .",
    "using such objects , particularly monopoles and vortices , models of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking have been advanced .",
    "a weakness of these models is that classical yang - mills does not possess monopole solutions , rather they have instanton solutions .",
    "however , in recent years it has become clear that _ periodic instantons have a substructure that can be identified with monopoles and other extended objects . in particular , charge one @xmath6 calorons ( finite temperature instantons ) can be viewed as bound states of @xmath7 monopole constituents @xcite . provided the ` size ' of the instanton is larger than the period ( or inverse temperature ) tubes of action density form .",
    "these can be identified with the worldlines of the constituent monopoles .",
    "it would be interesting to extend these results to higher charge sectors and higher tori , i.e. more than one period so that we are considering instantons on @xmath8 , @xmath9 . indeed , lattice based numerical studies indicate that doubly periodic instantons ( @xmath10 ) have remarkable properties including fractionally charged solutions , vortex - like objects and an exponentially decaying action density @xcite .",
    "none of these attributes are shared by the calorons .",
    "nevertheless , it would be desirable to have a unified description of calorons and multiply - periodic instantons and their constituents .",
    "_    the calorons are best understood within a formalism due to nahm @xcite .",
    "this is an extension of the adhm construction .",
    "nahm s approach was generalised to other four manifolds , notably the four - torus , @xmath11 @xcite . here",
    "it becomes a duality , mapping @xmath12 charge @xmath13 instantons on the four torus to @xmath14 charge @xmath7 instantons on the dual torus , @xmath15 ( defined by inverting the four periods ) .",
    "the caloron construction and even adhm can be understood as a limiting case of the four torus duality .",
    "one therefore expects that doubly periodic instantons can be treated in a similar fashion .",
    "jardim @xcite has used the nahm transform to discuss the charge one case . in @xcite doubly periodic charge one instantons with radial symmetry in the non - compact @xmath16 directions were considered . under the nahm transformation",
    "they are mapped to abelian potentials on the dual torus @xmath17 .",
    "starting with these rather simple nahm potentials the original instantons can be ` recovered ' via the inverse nahm transform .",
    "technically , this involves solving certain weyl - dirac equations ; for each @xmath18 one has a different weyl equation on @xmath17 .",
    "the weyl zero modes were determined explicitly for a two dimensional subspace ( corresponding to the origin of @xmath16 ) .    in a recent letter @xcite",
    "we used these zero modes to compute the action density , analytically and numerically , within the subspace .",
    "we found that there are points in @xmath19 where the solution of the weyl equations have softer singularities .",
    "these are obvious candidates for constituent locations .",
    "we interpreted these constituents as overlapping _",
    "instanton cores . for square tori",
    "our constituent picture correlates closely to the action density .",
    "some of the charge one solutions we considered can be cut in half yielding two copies of a charge @xmath20 instanton .",
    "this procedure is only consistent if the gauge potential has specific asymptotic boundary conditions which are analogous to a four torus twist .",
    "_    in this paper we obtain further information about doubly periodic instantons . in particular , action density plots for rectangular tori are presented .",
    "these clearly show how doubly periodic instantons interpolate between fractionally charged lumps characteristic of four torus solutions and monopole like tubes of actions density typical of calorons .",
    "furthermore , we present an analytical discussion of the exponential decay of the action density .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 the basics of the nahm transform",
    "are briefly reviewed , and its application to doubly periodic instantons is discussed .",
    "sections 3 to 5 deal with the nahm potentials , zero modes and constituents corresponding to charge one instantons with gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "section 6 describes some technical results regarding green s functions that crop up in field strength calculations .",
    "our numerical action density computations are detailed in section 7 .",
    "section 8 considers charge @xmath20 solutions and the asymptotics of the gauge field and field strength are discussed in section 9 .",
    "before we specialise to @xmath19 let us briefly recall how the nahm transform is formulated on the four torus @xcite ( for a string - theoretic approach see @xcite ) . start with a self - dual anti - hermitian @xmath6 potential , @xmath21 , on a euclidean four - torus with topological charge @xmath13 . a gauge field on @xmath11",
    "is understood to be an @xmath22 potential which is periodic ( modulo gauge transformations ) with respect to @xmath23 , the @xmath24 being the four periods of the torus .",
    "self - duality is the requirement that @xmath25 , and we have taken the convention @xmath26 . the next step is to turn the @xmath6 instanton into a @xmath12 instanton by adding a constant @xmath27 potential , @xmath28 , where the @xmath29 are real numbers .",
    "we can regard the @xmath29 as coordinates of the _ dual torus , @xmath15 , since the shifts @xmath30 can be effected via _",
    "periodic @xmath27 gauge transformations . _ _    now consider the @xmath12 weyl operator @xmath31 with @xmath32 where the @xmath33 are pauli matrices . provided certain mathematical technicalities are met @xmath34 has @xmath13 square - integrable zero modes @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the nahm potential is defined as @xmath37 here the zero modes are taken to be orthonormal .",
    "remarkably , @xmath38 is a @xmath14 instanton on the dual torus with topological charge @xmath7 .",
    "the associated field strength can be written as follows @xmath39.\\ ] ] the self duality of @xmath40 implies @xmath41 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath42 commutes with all @xmath43 , from which the self duality of @xmath44 follows .",
    "the ` original ' gauge potential , @xmath21 , can be recovered by nahm transforming @xmath45 @xmath46 where the @xmath47 , @xmath48 are an orthonormal set of zero modes of @xmath49 with @xmath50 . in other words",
    "the four torus nahm transform is involutive .",
    "formally , one can obtain the @xmath19 nahm transform by taking two of the periods , say @xmath51 and @xmath52 , to be infinite .",
    "given an @xmath6 instanton periodic with respect to @xmath53 , @xmath54 its nahm transform is @xmath55 where the @xmath35 with @xmath56 are orthonormal zero modes of @xmath57 .",
    "note that we may gauge @xmath58 and @xmath59 to zero . by assumption the zero modes @xmath35 are square integrable .",
    "this does not guarantee that the integrals in ( [ t2nahm ] ) exist .",
    "however , the integrals only diverge at special @xmath29 values where the zero modes do not decay exponentially .",
    "the number of these points turns out to be @xmath7 , i.e. it is determined by the gauge group of the instanton .",
    "to summarise , the nahm transform maps doubly periodic @xmath6 instantons with topological charge @xmath13 to self dual @xmath14 potentials on the dual torus , @xmath60 , with @xmath7 singularities .",
    "in the one - instanton case the nahm potential is abelian and the hitchin equations reduce to @xmath75 so that @xmath76 is anti - holomorphic in @xmath71 .",
    "as we shall see , @xmath77 can be taken as holomorphic .",
    "since @xmath77 is periodic it is an elliptic function .",
    "it is well known that they have at least two singularities .",
    "we expect the number of singularities to correspond to @xmath7 .",
    "let us stick to the simplest case @xmath78 .",
    "thus @xmath79 will have two simple poles .",
    "consider the ansatz @xmath80 which gives @xmath81 .",
    "it follows from that @xmath82 must be harmonic except at two singularities .",
    "a suitable @xmath82 satisfies @xmath83,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is a constant and @xmath85 are the positions of the two singularities ( we have used translational invariance to shift the ` centre of gravity ' of the singularities to the origin ) .",
    "the delta functions should be read as periodic ( with respect to @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "physically , the nahm potential describes two aharonov - bohm fluxes of strength @xmath84 and @xmath88 threading the dual torus .",
    "they must have equal and opposite strength to ensure a periodic @xmath89 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath84 lies between @xmath90 and @xmath91 since it is possible via a ( singular ) gauge transformation to shift @xmath84 by an integer amount ( under such a transformation the _ total flux through @xmath17 remains zero ) .",
    "one can write @xmath82 explicitly in terms of jacobi theta functions ( see for example  @xcite ) @xmath92 where @xmath71 and @xmath93 are the complex coordinates introduced in .",
    "the theta function is defined as @xmath94 and has the periodicity properties @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in each cell",
    "@xmath97 has a single zero located at the centre of the torus ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "we have chosen the constant term in ( [ phi ] ) so that the integral of @xmath82 over the dual torus is zero .",
    "this renders @xmath99 an odd function , @xmath100 .",
    "it is easy to see that inserting ( [ phi ] ) into ( [ ansatz ] ) yields a holomorphic @xmath77 with simple poles at the fluxes .",
    "_    what about the higgs field ? since we are aiming for an @xmath0 instanton it must , like @xmath38 , have two singularities .",
    "the singularities must be at the same two positions as in @xmath101 or else we have a total of four singularities which means we are considering a ( rather special ) @xmath102 instanton .",
    "the simplest way to arrange for @xmath101 and the higgs to have singularities at the same points is to choose them to be proportional @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a complex constant .",
    "not all possibilities are exhausted , since while the poles must coincide the zeroes need not .",
    "this remaining ambiguity corresponds to the freedom to add to @xmath76 a complex constant .",
    "however when we insert our nahm potential into the weyl equation such a shift is equivalent to a translation of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this nahm potential was derived in @xcite via the adhm construction . here",
    "the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath104 are related to the ` size ' , @xmath107 of an instanton centred at @xmath108 , @xmath109 although we do not directly use the adhm construction in the present paper this relation proves useful in interpreting our results .",
    "the nahm potential we have described has five parameters ; @xmath110 , @xmath111 fixing the flux separations , @xmath84 the flux strength and the complex parameter @xmath104 specifying the higgs field . then , with the four translations in @xmath112 , the corresponding doubly periodic instanton has a total of nine parameters .    to reconstruct the charge one @xmath0 instantons corresponding to our simple nahm potential",
    "we require the two zero modes of the weyl operator @xmath113 in addition to the complex coordinates @xmath71 , @xmath93 on @xmath17 we have introduced two sets of complex coordinates for @xmath19 ; in the ` parallel ' directions @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and in the ` transverse ' non - compact directions @xmath116 , @xmath117 . in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on the special case @xmath118 , i.e. zero higgs .",
    "this means that the corresponding instanton will be radially symmetric : the action density depends on @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 only .",
    "these radially symmetric solutions are a seven parameter subset of the doubly periodic @xmath0 one - instantons .",
    "from now on we stick to the zero higgs case ( i.e.  @xmath118 ) . even with this specialisation the weyl equations are still rather forbidding .",
    "however , there is one special case which is immediately tractable : when @xmath122 the weyl equation decouples and the two zero modes have a simple form @xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 are periodic green s functions satisfying @xmath125 here we have used both",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath71 coordinates in the same equation ; this possibly confusing usage will continue until the end of section  [ sec : soft ] .",
    "@xmath126 has a theta function representation @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "the corresponding result for @xmath129 can be obtained via @xmath130 .",
    "the zero modes have square - integrable singularities at both fluxes : near @xmath131 we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) @xmath135 has a single zero in @xmath60 at @xmath136 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath137 has a zero at @xmath138 .",
    "when @xmath139 the green s functions @xmath140 do not exist .",
    "this does not mean there are no zero modes , indeed one can see that @xmath141 are solutions of the @xmath139 weyl equation .",
    "@xmath142 has the expected square - integrable singularity at @xmath143 , but for @xmath144 , @xmath145 is zero . on",
    "the other hand @xmath146 diverges at @xmath144 but not at @xmath143 . by choosing @xmath139",
    "we have effectively moved the zeroes of the zero modes to flux locations .",
    "there is another way of doing this ; choosing @xmath147 brings the zero of @xmath142 to the other flux ( and similarly for @xmath148 ) .",
    "thus there are two @xmath149 values where each nahm zero mode diverges at only one flux .",
    "we wish to investigate whether these ` soft ' points can be interpreted as the locations of some kind of constituent .",
    "the singularity profiles of @xmath142 and @xmath148 are exchanged under the replacement @xmath150 suggesting that the constituents are exchanged under this mapping .",
    "that is , if there are indeed lumps at the two points , then @xmath150 swaps the two lumps .",
    "the following result formalises this idea @xmath151 where @xmath152 is some @xmath153 gauge transformation .",
    "the proof of goes as follows : make the change of variables @xmath154 in ( [ t2inverse ] ) . the zero mode @xmath155 satisfies the same weyl equation as @xmath47 except that the signs of @xmath84 and the @xmath156 are flipped .",
    "however , @xmath88 does not lie between @xmath90 and @xmath91 . under periodic gauge transformations @xmath157 and @xmath158",

    "this clearly satisfies the equation obtained by differentiating the weyl equation , @xmath175 , with respect to @xmath176 . multiplying from the left with @xmath177 and integrating over the dual torus yields",
    "@xmath178 which together with equations ( [ direct ] ) and ( [ modederivative ] ) give ( [ t4strength ] )",
    ".    our analysis of doubly periodic instantons has been based on the weyl equation and the inverse nahm transform ( [ t2inverse ] ) .",
    "these are the exact counterparts of four torus equations .",
    "therefore one might expect all the results quoted above to carry over directly to @xmath19 .",
    "there are , however , a number of important differences between the two cases . with regard to the @xmath19 construction , the green s function @xmath179 does not commute with the @xmath43 matrices . away from the @xmath7 singularities of @xmath38 , @xmath180 commutes with the @xmath43 . at the singularities it has source terms which are not proportional to @xmath181 . for the @xmath27 nahm potential considered in section 3 ( as usual we set @xmath118 ) @xmath182,\\ ] ] indicating that @xmath183 does not commute with @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "we will show that the naive @xmath19 limit of ( [ t4strength ] ) does not apply , so that @xmath183 not being proportional to @xmath181 does not signal a breakdown of the inverse nahm transform . starting with",
    "the inverse transform ( [ t2inverse ] ) , the field strength can be written in exactly the same way as in ( [ direct ] ) except that the integral is over @xmath60 rather than @xmath15 .",
    "the derivative formula ( [ modederivative ] ) also applies without modification to the @xmath17 zero modes .",

    "the field strength formula is similar to those one can derive for @xmath22 instantons and calorons via the adhm formalism .    to make these considerations more concrete",
    "we see how they apply to our simple @xmath27 nahm potential . in this case",
    "@xmath192 when @xmath193 this is invertible .",
    "the inverse has the form @xmath194 where the @xmath195 are finite for all @xmath70 and @xmath196 ( unless @xmath197 ) . because of the exponentials @xmath169 is singular if @xmath70 or @xmath196 equals @xmath85 . in the @xmath122 slice the @xmath198 have simple integral representations @xmath199 where @xmath140 are the green s functions defined in section 4 .",

    "the final result is very simple @xmath209 where @xmath210 note that @xmath211 is dimensionless , real and periodic ( with respect to @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , while @xmath212 is dimensionless , complex and periodic up to constant phases .",
    "can be checked component - wise ( see appendix  [ app : outline ] ) .",
    "we have given closed forms for the @xmath198 in the special case @xmath122 .",
    "an explicit construct valid beyond this two - dimensional slice would immediately provide the exact nahm zero modes and gauge potential .",

    "the two periods @xmath226 and @xmath227 can also be varied . however , the physically important quantity is the ratio of the lengths @xmath228 since scaling identically both lengths equates to a trivial scaling of the action density : @xmath229 in @xcite plots for different @xmath84 in the equal length case , @xmath230 , were presented .",

    "the instanton core and monopole constituent pictures are complementary . however , we have an example displaying features of both descriptions : +    ( 150,150)(-250,-270 ) ( -170,-280 ) ( -230,-180)@xmath255 ( -100,-265)@xmath243 ( 70,-230 ) @xmath256    above we plot the action density for @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "this configuration shows essentially no dependence on @xmath120 even though the lengths are equal .",
    "what seems to have occurred is that the two cores at @xmath139 and @xmath260 have merged into a _ single monopole . unlike in the previous examples the monopole worldline passes through the soft points .",
    "that there is only one worldline is not inconsistent with the constituent monopole picture since by virtue of @xmath259 the ` second ' monopole should be massless .",
    "the monopoles observed in figs .",
    "[ history ] and [ 3over8 ] have equal masses in accord with the symmetric value of @xmath111 . _",
    "when @xmath234 the two instanton cores are identical .",
    "this has an interesting consequence .",
    "if we choose the constituent locations so that they are separated by half periods the charge one instanton can be ` cut ' to yield two copies of a charge @xmath20 instanton ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this happens when @xmath261 is @xmath262 , @xmath263 or @xmath264 , see fig .",
    "[ constituents ] . after cutting we have a twist @xmath265 in the half torus . but to produce a half integer topological charge another ( non - orthogonal ) twist is required ; this is most simply achieved with @xmath266 .",
    "such a twist would have the novel feature of being associated with the non - compact @xmath105 and @xmath106 directions . far away from @xmath122",
    "the potential must be pure gauge @xmath267 where @xmath268 .",
    "the non - compact twist translates into a double valued gauge function , @xmath269 .",
    "( 100,250)(100,0 )    the examples considered in fig .  [ history ]",
    "are all ` doubled ' half instantons . here",
    "the cut tori are diamond shaped ( see fig .",
    "4 ) apart from the first @xmath270 plot , where it is square .",
    "this case has another interesting feature .",
    "compare the constituent locations with the half instanton obtained via @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 . on cutting both yield charge @xmath20 instantons on square tori with length @xmath275 .",
    "by analogy with the four torus case , for a given set of twists and periods , charge @xmath20 instantons are expected to be unique up to translations .",
    "yet these two cases have different values of @xmath236 , one has @xmath230 where the core picture should work while the other ( @xmath239 ) is expected to have some monopole characteristics . as can clearly be seen from the first plot in fig .  [ history ]",
    "the action density has maxima at the soft points .",
    "we have computed the @xmath239 case and found maxima _ not _ coincident with the soft points .",
    "the soft points correspond to saddle points of the action density . but allowing for translations the two half instantons are identical .",
    "what seems to be happening is that when @xmath239 the monopoles are still not developed , and in this intermediate state there are lumps of action density which while not at the soft points are identical to those at the soft points of the @xmath230 case . more precisely the two action densities satisfy @xmath276 the @xmath230 plot is obtained by a 45 degree rotation of the @xmath239 plot followed by a translation .",
    "this reflects the fact that the two nahm potentials are also related by a @xmath277 degree rotation .",
    "in this section we consider the large @xmath278 limit of the zero mode equations , and deduce the large @xmath278 behaviour of the gauge potential and field strength .",
    "this allows us to check that the charge @xmath20 instantons have the expected properties .",
    "in particular , we see that the gauge potential has asymptotic behaviour commensurate with a twist , @xmath266 .",
    "furthermore , the exponential decay of the action density is derived .",
    "in fact , all the @xmath234 solutions have both the twist and exponential decay even if they are not ` doubled ' @xmath20 instantons .    when @xmath278 is much larger than the two periods the zero modes of @xmath279 become strongly localised about the two flux singularities . in this regime",
    "we can approximate the zero modes with @xmath16 solutions .",
    "a single flux in @xmath16 corresponds to @xmath280 .",
    "the weyl operator is then @xmath281 when @xmath282 , @xmath283 has a normalisable zero mode . in the special cases",
    "@xmath284 the normalised modes take rather simple forms : @xmath285 where @xmath286 . for sufficiently large @xmath278",
    "we can take @xmath287 and extend the integration region from @xmath17 to @xmath16 .",
    "for this approximation to work it is important that the flux separation @xmath288 is less then both dual periods , @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "this is because we assume that the ` interference ' between the fluxes dominates the effect of the periodicity for large @xmath278 .",
    "note that @xmath291 inserting the zero modes ( [ approx ] ) into the inverse nahm transform ( [ t2inverse ] ) produces a @xmath153 potential ; we discard the pure gauge @xmath27 part .",
    "the remaining @xmath0 piece turns out to be in a different gauge to that implicit in section  [ greens ] .",
    "an explicit computation ( see appendix c ) shows that the @xmath0 potential has asymptotics corresponding to a twist and the action density has the exponential decay @xmath292 we can apply this to the charge @xmath20 case .",
    "consider such an instanton in a square box of length @xmath293 .",
    "this is a one instanton in the doubled box with @xmath294 , @xmath295 .",
    "here @xmath296 , @xmath259 , and so the @xmath20 instanton has the fall - off @xmath297 for a rectangular box simply replace @xmath293 with the longest length . in @xcite a decay exponent of @xmath298",
    "was reported for a unit box .",
    "this is within @xmath299 percent of the analytic value @xmath300 .",
    "the decay formula is reminiscent of similar results for bogomolnyi vortices in the abelian higgs model .",
    "there the decay exponent is straightforward to obtain while an analytic computation of the prefactor is still an open problem ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "one can repeat the analysis for @xmath301 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath16 zero modes are more complicated ; they can be written in terms of modified bessel functions . here",
    "the asymptotics of the gauge potential does not correspond to a four torus twist .",
    "more precisely , @xmath211 has the power decay @xmath302 where @xmath303 is a ( dimensionful ) constant .",
    "this translates into a twist only if @xmath234 .",
    "the question of the form of the decay was an important consideration in @xcite .",
    "there it was assumed that doubly periodic instantons have quadratically decaying field strength components .",
    "this translates into a quartic decay of the action density .",
    "yet the solutions we have discussed show a much more rapid exponential decay .",
    "this is not necessarily a contradiction since our discussion of the asymptotics was confined to the radial solutions whereas @xcite was concerned with the whole charge one sector .",
    "the more generic non - radial solutions may decay quartically .",
    "indeed the two monopole constituents are expected to be separated in the non - compact directions",
    ". this can give rise to an algebraic tail in the action density .",
    "we have developed an instanton core picture of the simplest doubly periodic instantons .",
    "numerical calculations of the action density correlate well with this picture for square tori .",
    "however , in rectangular tori the solutions become caloron - like when the ratio of the two periods is increased ; the cores merge with periodic copies of themselves in the short direction to form monopole - like tubes of action density .",
    "the basic properties of these monopoles , such as their mass ratios and spatial separation , follow the pattern of the charge one @xmath0 calorons",
    ". it would be interesting to develop this monopole constituent description in a more direct manner .",
    "one approach would be to exploit the fact that the radially symmetric solutions considered here fall into a class of axially - symmetric multi - calorons discussed recently @xcite if one allows for infinite topological charge .",
    "there are a number of obvious ways to extend the results in this paper .",
    "an explicit treatment of the @xmath282 zero mode equation is still lacking . in the non - radially symmetric case ( @xmath304 )",
    "the zero mode equations have not yielded solutions for any points in @xmath19 . even in the absence of explicit zero modes it might be possible to extract some information about possible instanton core or monopole constituents .",
    "a more straightforward extension would be to generalise the results regarding radially symmetric one instantons to @xmath6 .",
    "that these solutions decay exponentially indicates they can be compactified further to @xmath305 or even @xmath11 .",
    "the latter is only possible for the @xmath234 case where the asymptotics of the gauge field correspond to a twist .",

    "inserting the zero modes into the definition of @xmath204 ( [ fdef ] ) yields @xmath306 where @xmath307 it is not obvious that @xmath204 commutes with @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "this only holds if the coefficients of the projectors @xmath308 match , that is if @xmath309 a proof of ( [ nonquat ] ) for @xmath122 was given in @xcite .",
    "it is sufficient to show that the left and right hand sides of ( [ nonquat ] ) have the same asymptotics at the fluxes since when @xmath310 they satisfy the same differential equation .",
    "consider @xmath311 in the neighbourhood of @xmath144 .",
    "it follows immediately from ( [ gdef ] ) that @xmath312 whereas @xmath313 is non - zero",
    ". this does not contradict ( [ nonquat ] ) since @xmath314 diverges ( @xmath315 ) at @xmath144 .",
    "a short calculation gives @xmath316 this is compatible with ( [ nonquat ] ) if @xmath317 to check this , note that for @xmath318 both sides satisfy the same differential equation and then examine them in the neighbourhoods of @xmath319 . from this discussion of the asymptotics of @xmath320",
    "it should be clear that @xmath206 , unlike @xmath169 is always finite .",
    "indeed @xmath206 tends to zero as @xmath70 or @xmath196 approaches a flux point .",
    "here we outline the computation of @xmath321 ; the other components can be dealt with in much the same way .",
    "inserting the zero modes into the inverse nahm transform yields @xmath322 using @xmath323 and the representation ( 33 ) of @xmath324 @xmath325 as required .",
    "for @xmath326 we proceed similarly @xmath327 the key step is to use ( [ key ] ) @xmath328 now use ( [ gdef ] ) to write @xmath329 in terms of @xmath330 and the formula @xmath331 to get the result @xmath332 .",
