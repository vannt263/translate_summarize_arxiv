    "this paper aims at developing a systems theory approach to the modeling of criminality phenomena in a territory .",
    "this objective is pursued bearing in mind the idea that all living systems in general , and social systems in particular , are complex @xcite .",
    "this feature , as observed in @xcite , as well as in the collection of articles @xcite , is related to the fact that individuals have the ability to develop specific strategies , which depend also on those expressed by the other individuals .",
    "these strategies are heterogeneously distributed .",
    "moreover , individuals in socio - economic systems are able to learn from their experience .",
    "this implies that the expression of the strategy evolves in time , and consequently that interaction dynamics undergo modifications .",
    "the main feature of these systems is that their collective overall behavior is determined by the dynamics of their interactions , while the modeling of individual dynamics does not lead in a straightforward way to a mathematical description of collective emerging behaviors .",
    "therefore , the challenging objective of the modeling consists in transferring the dynamics at the scale of individual entities into collective emerging behaviors .",
    "the contents are mainly motivated by two well defined hints .",
    "the first one is related to the idea that the dynamical processes in economics and social sciences are highly affected by individual ( rational or irrational ) behaviors , reactions , and interactions .",
    "these concepts have begun to impose themselves to the traditional assumption of rational socio - economic behavior , starting from the concept of bounded rationality @xcite .",
    "therefore , the contribution of mathematics to a deeper understanding of the relationships between individual behaviors and collective outcomes may be fundamental @xcite .",
    "this new methodological approach looks at economics , and social sciences in general , as evolving complex systems , where interactions among heterogeneous individuals can even produce unpredictable emerging outcomes @xcite . in this context ,",
    "mathematical tools are required to capture the evolving features of socio - economic systems and incorporate some of their main complexity features .",
    "possibly up to the ability to predict the so - called _ black swan _ , which is defined to be a rare event , showing up as an irrational collective trend generated by possibly rational individual behaviors @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on criminality being motivated by an increasing interest in the public safety and security in cities .",
    "an important contribution is that of felson @xcite who gives -from a criminologist s point of view- some basic hints for mathematicians concerning the modeling of crime .",
    "he introduces the presence of three fundamental elements that participate in the phenomena , namely offenders , targets and guardians .",
    "additional phenomenological interpretations are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "many of the existing models refer to the spatially homogeneous case , while some others introduce the geographic or spatially dependent component in kinetic theory @xcite and statistical @xcite methods .",
    "tools of games theory @xcite have been successfully used to model criminality , starting from the so - called prisoner s dilemma and moving towards more sophisticated games . in @xcite , a game involving @xmath0 players",
    "is considered , where each of them may express four different strategies : paladin , apathetic , informant or villain , while in @xcite a network study is considered by taking into account subgroups of players through sacred value networks @xcite .",
    "methodologically different approaches can be based on deterministic dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the second hint is offered by recent developments of methods of kinetic theory and statistical mechanics in fields far from the classical one of molecular fluid dynamics .",
    "methods of the generalized kinetic theory have been first applied to model the social dynamics of insects @xcite , followed by a blow up in a rapidly growing literature covering a variety of applications . among them and without claim of completeness , modeling of social systems",
    "@xcite , opinion formation with dynamics over networks @xcite , migration phenomena @xcite , selective mutations in epidemiology @xcite and darwinian mutation and selection on cancer phenomena contrasted by immune cells @xcite .",
    "the mathematical approach developed in the previously cited papers belongs to the so - called kinetic theory for active particles , for short ktap approach , which refers to large population of living entities interacting with rules modeled by theoretical tools of game theory .",
    "the collection of surveys @xcite witnesses the beginning of a systematic use of methods of the kinetic theory in a variety of applications , which have been subsequently developed in the last decades by several authors , among others @xcite .",
    "focusing on the contents of the paper , let us consider a population of individuals distributed in a certain territory , they can be subdivided into citizens , criminals and detectives .",
    "each aggregation of individuals expresses with a certain intensity its own function - strategy .",
    "for instance citizens operate to improve their own wealth , criminals to subtract it to them and to hide themselves from the chase of detectives , who operate to contrast criminality .",
    "the modeling approach aims at studying the interplay between individuals of different aggregations and their growth or decay , which can include transition from one population to the other .",
    "various concomitant causes can , in general , play a role in the development or depletion of criminality , for instance migration phenomena and welfare policy .",
    "an interesting objective consists in looking for extreme events , namely the so - called black swan @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized through five more sections . in detail ,",
    "section 2 presents a phenomenological description of the complex system treated in this paper , subsequently a modeling strategy is proposed .",
    "section 3 introduces , starting from the description of interactions at the scale of individuals , the mathematical structures suitable to provide the basis for the derivation of specific models . a mathematical model",
    "is derived in section 4 based on the said general framework for a society with wealth distribution constant in time .",
    "some simulations are presented in section 5 in order to test the predictive ability of the model . finally , section 6 focuses on the development of a general systems theory approach to sociology .",
    "let us consider a large population of individuals with a spatially homogeneous distribution over certain territory , say a town or a region .",
    "the specific features of the population are heterogeneously distributed among individuals , who can , however , be subdivided into different groups such as citizens owning a certain amount of wealth , small or large , criminals of different levels of villainy , and detectives who are in charge of chasing criminals .",
    "moreover , migration phenomena can be possibly taken into account considering that large towns can attract people from surrounding areas .",
    "let us briefly summarize the approach , proposed in @xcite , to model complex systems by the ktap approach .    *",
    "individuals are viewed as _ active particles _ , that have the ability to express a specific strategy , called _ activity _ , which defines their micro - state , namely the state at the microscopic scale . *",
    "active particles are subdivided into _ functional subsystems _ , such that they express a specific activity for each subsystem . *",
    "the activity variable is heterogeneously distributed over the particles , while the overall _ state _ of the population of active particles is delivered , for each subsystem , by a distribution function over the micro - state .",
    "* interactions between particles are modeled by theoretical tools of game theory , while the equations describing the dynamics of particles are obtained by a balance in the elementary volume in the space of the micro - states . the inflow and outflow of particles , into and from the said volume ,",
    "is determined by interactions . *",
    "the solution of mathematical problems , typically initial and initial - boundary value problems , provides the time evolution of the aforesaid distribution function and hence of the macroscopic description obtained by weighted averaged quantities .",
    "emerging behaviors can be depicted by both distribution function and macro - quantities .",
    "an approach , according to the specific features of the class of systems under consideration , can be proposed as described by the following sequential steps :    1 .",
    "subdivision of the overall system into functional subsystems , each of them with the ability of expressing a different activity ( strategy ) ; 2 .",
    "modeling interactions at the micro - scale , namely between active particles of the same or different functional subsystems ; including learning dynamics , which might generate transition from one subsystem to the other ; 3 .",
    "derivation of a mathematical structure suitable to describe the evolution in time of the distribution function over the micro - state of particles of each subsystem ; 4 .",
    "derivation of mathematical models related to the structures introduced in the previous item ; 5 .   analysis and validation of models .    this approach will be formalized , in the next sections , being aware that it is limited to a simple picture of the complex variety of social and economic dynamics that effectively occur in our society .",
    "nevertheless , we claim that it has to be regarded as a first step towards a more general systems theory approach to sociology .",
    "this preliminary step will be followed by the study of more complex case studies outlined in the last section , which looks ahead to research perspectives .",
    "this section shows how the strategy presented in section 2 can be transferred into the derivation of a mathematical structure that can offer the framework suitable to model the collective dynamics involving different categories of citizens interacting in a territory .",
    "the contents are presented through the next three subsections corresponding to the first sequential steps of the aforesaid strategy , where the last paragraph also proposes a critical analysis in view of the modeling approach .",
    "the approach is based on the assumption that the total number of citizens and the wealth distribution are constant in time .",
    "let us consider a population homogeneously distributed in a territory .",
    "individuals in the population are regarded as _ active particles _ subdivided into a small number of groups according to the specific functions they express in the competition treated in this paper .",
    "the present approach aims at studying how the size of these groups evolves in time , how crime arises and can be controlled in a society , and how the distribution of the level of different expressions evolves in time .",
    "therefore , in consonance with the phenomenological description given in the preceding section , the following subdivision into _ functional subsystems _ is proposed :    @xmath1 normal citizens , whose microscopic state is identified by their wealth , which constitutes the attraction for the eventual perpetration of criminal acts .",
    "@xmath2 criminals , whose microscopic state is given by their criminal ability , namely their ability to succeed in the perpetration of illegal acts .",
    "@xmath3 detectives who chase criminals according to their individual ability .",
    "the microscopic variables are assumed to be , for each functional subsystem , a real variable @xmath4 taking values in the subsets @xmath5 , respectively . assuming that a maximal activity value can be identified in each functional subsystem , these three sets are taken , for the sake of simplicity , to be the interval @xmath6 $ ] , although it is important to keep in mind that the meaning of the variable differs from one functional subsystem to another . however , worse conditions correspond to lower values of the activity variable , while increasing values of @xmath4 correspond to higher abilities to express the strategy .",
    "the following table specifies the activity , micro - scale , variable within each functional subsystem :    [ table ]    .microscopic variable for each functional subsystem . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the different emerging behaviors , corresponding to the aforementioned computational study , are presented and summarized in table 5 . although the computational study can not be considered exhaustive , still some useful indications are delivered",
    ". the most important one is , according to the authors bias , the need of a detailed analysis of the interplay of different dynamics . in this specific case , the welfare policy and that of the fight against crime .",
    "previous studies , namely @xcite - focused on the dynamics of support and opposition to regimes - and @xcite - focused on the growth or decay of global wealth - have shown that the interaction of two dynamics can lead to non - expected outputs , in some cases even to non - predictable events .",
    "presumably , the investigation is worth to be developed even in this specific social problem studied in this paper .",
    "the contents of this paper suggest various perspectives for further research activity in the field focusing on simulations and model validation , analytic problems , and understanding the role of space dynamics . some of topics is presented at an introductory level in the next subsections according to a selection based on the authors bias . for each of them some hints for future research activity",
    "will be given .",
    "the survival of functional subsystems might , in some cases , depend on their size .",
    "if the size of a functional subsystem falls below a critical value @xmath7 , then interactions reduce to transfer individuals from the original one towards an aggregation to another one or the dynamics is modified .",
    "for instance , for detectives , their action is negligible if the critical size goes below a certain level needed for an efficient action .",
    "interactions depend also on the domain of the activity variable , within which each particle has the ability to perceive a sufficient amount of signals and develop consequently a strategy @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", interactions occur in a domain @xmath8 , while sufficient information is achieved if a number @xmath9 of field particles is involved .",
    "integration of @xmath10 over the activity variable in a domain @xmath11 , u + s_m[f;n_c]]$ ] , which can be called the topological domain of interaction , can lead to compute @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "however , the solution is unique only in some special cases .",
    "for instance , when @xmath4 is a scalar defined over the whole real axis , and the sensitivity is symmetric with respect to @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath4 is defined in a bounded domain or the sensitivity is not symmetric , additional assumptions are required .",
    "the set @xmath15 is a part of the effective interaction domain , which is the intersection of the theoretical maximum domain of activity of an individual with the support of @xmath16 .",
    "the topological domain is concerned with the possible activities of individuals , defined by their effective domain .",
    "the choice of the topological domain depends in this way on the neighborhood of the activity but also on more preferred activities of the individuals , although not necessarily measured in the euclidean distance .",
    "this issue is also related to the previous subsection [ 7.2 ] .",
    "let us first define the concept of sub - domains we will deal with and assume that each functional population has the same global interests .",
    "one can imagine a scenario in which any population is subdivided in different groups that may develop different or complementary strategies among them or to cooperate or have a consensus with individuals or groups of other populations .",
    "for example , consider that the criminal population is divided into two factions with common interests , although they can compete ( or collaborate ) with resources based on different strategies in connection with some other individuals or groups ( police or ordinary citizens ) that may have confluent strategy towards a common benefit , at least temporarily .",
    "these relationships can bring this subgroup into more social positions or just to castle on criminal ones .",
    "each of these subgroups defines a sub - domain of the population of criminals , that shares the main features of the whole population but has some specific rules in relation with the other group .",
    "emergent processes are also a consequence of the interactions of these sub - domains of the different populations .    on the other hand , the dynamics of each sub - domain might be defined in terms of the characteristic curves associated with the activity variable .",
    "the flux across these curves must be characterized through the potential generated by the activity , that involves the sub - domains of the different populations .",
    "this is a challenging issue that needs more precise and detailed definitions which will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the model presented in the section 4 does not include an analysis of the role of external actions , which can be applied to reduce criminality either by repressive ( or persuasion ) actions , or by improving the expertise of detectives . in principle , also an educative action can be addressed to citizens to improve their ability to protect their goods .",
    "a simple model consists in assuming that a macro - scale action , say @xmath17 depending on time and activity variables is applied to the functional subsystems corresponding to the second and third functional subsystem .",
    "the modeling of this action is achieved by inserting it in the transport term , which is linear if the action depends only on @xmath18 and @xmath4 , while it is nonlinear when it depends also on the distribution functions , @xmath19(t , u)$ ] .",
    "of course these actions have a cost , which have to be related to the benefit of the criminality reduction .",
    "classically , if this aspect is introduced a control and optimization problem can be developed .",
    "models and simulations proposed in the paper refer to a population homogeneously distributed in space .",
    "a variety of real world applications suggests to extend the study to populations distributed in networks @xcite , where interaction between nodes can , in some cases , play an important role in the overall dynamics , for instance inducing migration phenomena @xcite . also the distribution over space is of practical interest to understand the real localization of criminality and their level of danger in specific areas of the territory .",
    "the classical problem consists in deriving macroscopic pdes models from the underlying description at the microscopic scale .",
    "the pioneer ideas of paper @xcite , developed in @xcite for hyperbolic scaling for multicellular systems with internal structures , need additional nontrivial studies to take into account the heterogeneous features of the territory .",
    "consider the banach space @xmath20 , where @xmath21,\\boldsymbol{x})\\quad\\mbox { and } \\quad\\|{\\mathbf{f}}\\|_\\infty=\\max_{t\\in[0,t_1]}\\|{\\mathbf{f}}(t,\\cdot)\\|\\ ] ] and @xmath22 will be specified later . put @xmath23 and @xmath24 clearly , @xmath25 is a non - empty , closed subset of the banach space @xmath26 .",
    "the local existence and uniqueness of the solution follows from an application of the banach fixed point theorem .",
    "indeed , it is easy to check that if @xmath40 is a solution of in @xmath41\\times[0,1]$ ] then @xmath40 is a fixed point of @xmath42 and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , @xmath43 , since for all @xmath44 it results that @xmath45 , @xmath46 for @xmath31 , and for all @xmath47 $ ] @xmath48ds\\bigg\\}\\le e^{-ct}+3a(1-e^{-ct})\\\\ \\le & 1 + 3a(1-e^{-ct_1})\\le a,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where is taken into account .",
    "now , proceeding as in the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) , we obtain , for all @xmath49 , the following inequality : @xmath50}\\sum_{i=1}^3\\int_0 ^ 1|\\mathscr s{\\mathbf{f}}(t , u)-\\mathscr s\\boldsymbol{g}(t , u)|du\\le k\\|{\\mathbf{f}}-\\boldsymbol{g}\\|_\\infty,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , by .    therefore , the operator @xmath52 is a contraction , and by the banach fixed point theorem there exists a unique solution @xmath40 of defined in @xmath41\\times[0,1]$ ] . by  , @xmath53 , then , by iterating the reasoning as in the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
