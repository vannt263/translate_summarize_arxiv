    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) has relevance for the gauge hierarchy problem , fine - tuning considerations  @xcite suggest that supersymmetric particles typically have mass on order of or below the tev scale .",
    "the discovery of some supersymmetric particles is therefore eagerly anticipated at present and future colliders .",
    "in particular , the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite at cern is likely to discover squarks and gluinos up to masses of @xmath1  @xcite , and proposed linear @xmath2 colliders  @xcite , with @xmath3 , will be able to discover pair - produced superpartners with masses close to the kinematic limit  @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , that some number of the superpartners of the standard model ( sm ) particles are heavy and beyond the discovery reach of planned future colliders .",
    "in fact , as will be described in more detail below , a wide variety of models predict superparticle spectra leading to such scenarios .",
    "if this possibility is actually realized in nature , we must then rely solely on indirect methods to probe the masses and properties of these heavy superparticles , at least until colliders at even higher energies become available . in most experimentally accessible processes ,",
    "heavy supersymmetric states decouple , and their effects are not measurable for the large masses we are considering .",
    "however , the larger these masses are , the more they break susy , and so their effects may appear at detectable levels in processes involving light superpartners as violations of hard supersymmetric relations , _",
    "i.e. _ , supersymmetric relations between dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "for example , consider the gauge couplings @xmath4 , where the subscript @xmath5 refers to the u(1 ) , su(2 ) , or su(3 ) gauge group , and their susy counterparts , the gaugino - fermion - sfermion couplings , which we denote by @xmath6 . in the limit of unbroken supersymmetry ,",
    "@xmath7    however , the large susy breaking masses of heavy superpartners lead to deviations from these susy relations in the low energy effective theory where the heavy superpartners are decoupled .",
    "these deviations are non - decoupling and grow logarithmically with the heavy superpartner masses .",
    "in addition , eq .  ( [ equivalence ] ) is model - independent and valid to all orders in the limit of unbroken susy .",
    "deviations from the relations of eq .",
    "( [ equivalence ] ) are therefore unambiguous signals of susy breaking mass splittings .",
    "thus , the masses of kinematically inaccessible sparticles may be measured by precise determinations of such deviations from processes involving the accessible sparticles .    the corrections to eq .",
    "( [ equivalence ] ) from split supermultiplets are very similar to the oblique corrections  @xcite from split su(2 ) multiplets in the standard model .",
    "this analogy has been described in detail in a previous paper  @xcite and was noted in ref .",
    "ignoring yukawa couplings , these corrections are dominantly from differences in the wavefunction renormalizations of gauge bosons and gauginos , which result from inequivalent loops after the decoupling of heavy superpartners .",
    "such corrections are therefore most similar to those described by the @xmath8 parameter of the oblique corrections  @xcite , which is a measure of the difference between the wavefunction renormalizations of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 gauge bosons arising from custodial isospin breaking masses in su(2 ) multiplets . for this reason , in ref .  @xcite we called the corresponding susy corrections `` super - oblique corrections '' and defined a set of `` super - oblique parameters , '' @xmath11 , one for each gauge group , which measure deviations from eq .",
    "( [ equivalence ] ) .",
    "these parameters are given by  @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the heavy ( light ) superpartner scale , and @xmath14 is the one - loop @xmath15-function coefficient for the gauge ( gaugino ) coupling in the effective theory between the heavy and light mass scales .",
    "note that @xmath16 , and so the super - oblique parameters are always positive ( at the leading logarithm level )  @xcite .",
    "we also defined two - index parameters measuring the relative deviations of two gauge groups ,    @xmath17    the parameters @xmath18 are simple linear combinations of the @xmath11 , but are physically relevant , as they are quantities that may be probed in branching ratio measurements , as we will see in an example below .",
    "these super - oblique parameters parametrize universal effects that enter all processes involving gaugino - fermion - sfermion interactions , and their simple form allows us to study such non - decoupling effects in a model - independent fashion .",
    "other flavor - dependent non - decoupling corrections , for example , those induced by yukawa couplings , and additional super - oblique corrections @xmath19 were also described in ref .",
    "@xcite ; we refer interested readers to that study for discussion of these and other issues .    depending on which superpartners are heavy , the models that contain heavy superparticles may be roughly divided into two categories  @xcite : `` heavy qcd models '' and `` 21 models . '' in heavy qcd models , all strongly - interacting superpartners , _",
    "i.e. _ , the gluino and all squarks , are in the heavy sector .",
    "their large susy breaking masses may arise from either the proportionality of soft masses to standard model gauge coupling constants or the renormalization group evolution effects of a large gluino mass .",
    "examples of such models include the no - scale limit of minimal supergravity  @xcite , models of gauge - mediated susy breaking  @xcite , and models with non - universal gaugino masses and a heavy gluino  @xcite .",
    "the super - oblique corrections in these models have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the results are    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is typically @xmath22 in heavy qcd models .    in 21 models , the scalars of the first two generations are heavy and the third generation scalars are at the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "these models are motivated by attempts to solve the susy flavor problem with heavy first two generation scalars while avoiding extreme fine - tuning problems by keeping the third generation scalars , which couple strongly to the higgs sector , at the weak scale .",
    "assuming all gauginos to be in the light sector , the super - oblique corrections in 21 models were found in ref .",
    "@xcite to be    @xmath23    in 21 models , values of @xmath24 in the range @xmath25 may be taken as typical .",
    "although the values of expected super - oblique parameters vary from model to model , they are always proportional to the square of their corresponding standard model gauge couplings , as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "thus , we typically expect the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 to be the largest , and , for example , a 1% measurement of @xmath29 is more powerful than a 1% measurement of @xmath30 for the purposes of bounding new physics scales . finally , note that extra vector - like fields with both susy preserving and susy breaking masses , such as the messengers in gauge mediation models , may also contribute to the super - oblique parameters .",
    "such contributions were also calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and were found to be typically small , with significant contributions only for very highly split supermultiplets .",
    "the possibility of measuring the supersymmetric couplings @xmath6 and testing the relations @xmath31 has been discussed previously . in the original proposal",
    "@xcite , the possibility of testing the su(2 ) relation through chargino production at the next linear collider ( nlc ) was explored . here",
    "the focus was on establishing the identity of new particles as superpartners through the verification of susy relations .",
    "a test of the u(1 ) relation through @xmath32 was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this study , both the possibilities of verifying susy relations and of being sensitive to deviations arising from heavy sparticle thresholds were considered .",
    "corrections to hard supersymmetry relations were previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where deviations in squark widths were calculated .",
    "however , the possibility of experimentally verifying such deviations was not addressed .    in this paper",
    ", we will systematically classify the many experimental observables that depend on the couplings @xmath6 and are therefore formally candidates for measuring super - oblique parameters .",
    "we then consider three representative examples of observables that may be sufficiently sensitive to such parameters to yield interesting results . even after including many experimental errors and the theoretical uncertainties arising from the plethora of unknown susy parameters , we find some promising prospects for very high precision measurements .",
    "the results have implications for collider design , as certain options , particularly the @xmath0 mode and adjustable beam energies , will be seen to be particularly useful .",
    "it is important to note that a complete study will require detailed experimental simulations appropriate to the particular scenario realized in nature , and the case studies we consider typically require measurements beyond the first stage of experimental study . however , given that the measurements discussed here may be the only experimental window on physics beyond the tev scale for the foreseeable future , such issues are well worth investigation .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : observables ] by identifying the many experimental observables that may possibly be used to detect variations in the hard susy relations .",
    "of course , not all of these observables may be measured precisely enough to provide significant bounds on heavy superpartner masses . in sec .",
    "[ sec : uncertainties ] we discuss the many uncertainties , both experimental and theoretical , that appear in any measurement , and we describe our treatment of these errors . in secs .",
    "[ sec : charginos][sec : squarks ] , detailed discussions of the precisions achievable are given for three representative examples , one for each coupling constant relation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : charginos ] , we will find that chargino production at the nlc gives bounds on the heavy mass scale comparable to those achieved from @xmath33 in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : selectrons ] , we improve upon both of these results by considering selectron production in the @xmath34 mode , where a number of beautiful properties may be exploited to reach very high precision . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : squarks ] , we find that significant constraints on the su(3 ) super - oblique parameter may also be possible from squark branching ratios in particular regions of parameter space .",
    "these examples are by no means exhaustive .",
    "however , they make use of three different sets of sparticles , and are presented to emphasize the variety of precise probes that may be used to provide interesting bounds .",
    "the numerous implications of such measurements are collected in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as seen in the previous section , heavy superpartners may induce significant corrections to all three coupling constant relations @xmath35 .",
    "we now discuss what observables at colliders have dependences on the couplings @xmath6 and are therefore candidates for testing these relations and determining the super - oblique parameters . in this section",
    ", we will concentrate on measuring the couplings @xmath6 at the light superparticle mass scale @xmath36 .",
    "such measurements allow one to measure the heavy sparticle mass scale @xmath37 .",
    "of course , measurements of @xmath6 at higher momentum transfers @xmath38 may also be extremely useful , and would allow one to verify the convergence of @xmath39 as @xmath40 . here",
    ", however , we will focus on the classification and measurement of observables at @xmath41 , leaving the latter for future studies .",
    "we begin with observables at @xmath2 ( and @xmath34 ) colliders , where the ability to make precise model - independent measurements of a wide variety of susy parameters is most promising .",
    "the @xmath2 observables all have analogues at hadron colliders , and we then turn to hadron colliders and discuss briefly which of these appear most promising in that experimental environment .",
    "analogous observables may also be found at a @xmath42 collider , with appropriate and obvious replacements of selectrons by smuons in the case of electroweak observables .",
    "each kinematically accessible superpartner brings with it a set of observables .",
    "we consider each superpartner in turn , grouping together those that are similar for this analysis .",
    "if charginos are kinematically accessible , their production cross sections are possible probes .",
    "this applies formally to all reactions , ranging from chargino pair production to more unusual processes where charginos are produced in association with other particles , such as in @xmath44 production . in the most obvious and useful example , charginos are pair - produced in @xmath2 collisions through @xmath45-channel @xmath46 and @xmath10 diagrams and @xmath47-channel sneutrino exchange .",
    "the latter diagram depends on the coupling @xmath48 , and so chargino pair production cross sections may be used to measure the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , this will serve as our first example in sec .  [",
    "sec : charginos ] .",
    "if charginos have two or more open decay modes , their branching fractions may be also be used .. in special circumstances , such as when the decays are extremely suppressed and the decay lengths are macroscopic , the widths themselves may be measurable . in general , however , individual decay widths are very difficult to measure , and we will therefore concentrate on their ratios in the following . ] for example , if decays @xmath49 and @xmath50 are both open , the ratio of these branching fractions is dependent on @xmath51 ( if the chargino is pure wino ) and may serve as a probe as well .    for neutralinos ,",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "neutralino pair production cross sections depend on @xmath52 and @xmath48 through diagrams with @xmath47-channel @xmath53 exchange .",
    "their branching fractions are also accessible probes when two or more decay modes are competitive .",
    "an interesting effect of the super - oblique corrections for charginos and neutralinos is the modification of their mass matrices .",
    "for example ,",
    "the conventional chargino mass terms are @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and    @xmath56    here @xmath57 is the su(2 ) gaugino mass , @xmath58 is the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values , and @xmath59 is the higgsino mass parameter .",
    "the off - diagonal entries of the mass matrix result from the interactions @xmath60 . in the presence of super - oblique corrections , these entries must be modified by @xmath61 .",
    "similar comments apply to the neutralino mixing matrix .",
    "thus , precise measurements of the chargino and neutralino masses and mixings may also yield bounds on the super - oblique parameters .",
    "such precision measurements were in fact studied for charginos in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the mixed region , where there is large gaugino - higgsino mixing ,",
    "interesting bounds may be obtained , although measurements of the super - oblique parameters at the percent level appear difficult . however , in the regions of parameter space in which charginos and neutralinos are nearly pure gauginos or higgsinos , the dependence on the off - diagonal terms is small , and the effects of super - oblique parameters through the mass matrices are negligible .    before considering other sparticles ,",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "first , it is clear that no tests are applicable in all regions of parameter space . for the observables above to be sensitive to the super - oblique parameters , for example",
    ", it is necessary not only that charginos and neutralinos be produced , but also that they have either large gaugino components or substantial gaugino - higgsino mixing .",
    "second , all observables depend on many additional susy parameters , including , for example , the masses and compositions of the charginos and neutralinos , and the masses of the sfermions entering the process .",
    "thus , a determination of @xmath6 requires a simultaneous determination of many other parameters .",
    "this is one of the essential difficulties in these analyses , and will be addressed in detail in the case studies of the following sections .      for measurements of super - oblique parameters , selectrons @xmath62 and electron sneutrinos @xmath63 afford special opportunities .",
    "for example , selectron pair - production cross sections receive contributions from @xmath47-channel neutralino exchange , and so the @xmath64 and @xmath65 cross sections depend on @xmath52 , while the @xmath66 cross section depends on both @xmath52 and @xmath48 .",
    "this dependence was exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite to measure @xmath52 at @xmath2 colliders .",
    "note , however , that selectrons , unlike gauginos , may also be produced in pairs in @xmath34 collisions .",
    "such reactions may lead to particularly precise measurements and will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : selectrons ] .",
    "selectron branching fractions may also be useful when two decay modes are open .",
    "for example , the ratio @xmath67 depends on @xmath68 , and may therefore be used to probe @xmath69 .",
    "electron sneutrinos may also be produced in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "their production cross sections receive contributions from @xmath47-channel chargino exchange , and so are sensitive to @xmath48 .",
    "their branching ratios may also be used .",
    "if gluinos and the other scalars ( squarks , higgs bosons , and second or third generation sleptons ) are accessible , they may also provide useful information .",
    "cross sections for production in association with gauginos , for example , @xmath70 , depend on @xmath6 couplings .",
    "in addition , as with the other particles , their branching ratios are also possible probes . we will consider the case of squark branching ratios in sec .",
    "[ sec : squarks ] .",
    "all of the observables mentioned above have analogues at hadron colliders .",
    "a promising aspect of hadron colliders is that strongly interacting sparticles may be produced in great numbers , allowing probes of the qcd relations , where the greatest deviations are expected",
    ". the production cross sections of gluinos and squarks are dependent on the couplings @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , cross section measurements at hadron colliders are open to systematic uncertainties that , at the level of precision we require for this study , make such measurements rather difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "branching ratios may be well measured .",
    "for example , if squarks may decay to both gluinos and electroweak gauginos , the relative rates may be a sensitive probe of the super - oblique corrections .",
    "similar comments apply to sleptons and electroweak gauginos when more than one decay path is open .",
    "the extent to which these branching ratios may be measured depends strongly on the efficiency for extracting these signals from background , and is dependent on many susy parameters . in this study",
    ", we will concentrate on @xmath2 probes , although , given the exciting prospects for discovering susy at the lhc , probes there certainly merit attention , especially if portions of the sparticle spectrum are not observed or branching ratios deviate from expectations .",
    "so far we have concentrated on observables involving gaugino interactions as probes of the super - oblique corrections .",
    "in fact , however , heavy superpartner sectors may also induce non - decoupling effects in interactions that do not involve gauginos .",
    "in particular , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath71-term quartic scalar couplings also receive corrections .",
    "such corrections appear in a wide variety of observables .    nevertheless , they are generically highly challenging to probe experimentally . to begin with , the couplings of four physical scalars are extremely difficult to measure .",
    "however , @xmath71-term couplings also result in cubic scalar couplings when one field is a higgs .",
    "these appear in more accessible observables , including , for example , the widths of heavy higgs boson decays to sfermions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "( note that the @xmath71-term trilinear terms discussed here involve same - chirality sfermions and are not suppressed by yukawa couplings ; they may thereby be distinguished from yukawa - suppressed trilinear terms that originate from @xmath74-terms or from soft susy breaking trilinear interactions . )",
    "unfortunately , in the models we are considering , heavy higgs bosons may be very heavy , since their mass is governed by @xmath59 , which , given the constraint of the @xmath10 boson mass , is typically at the third generation squark mass scale .",
    "in addition , heavy higgs bosons are difficult to study at hadron colliders , and their interactions depend on a number of other parameters , such as @xmath58 and the @xmath75-even higgs mixing angle @xmath76 .",
    "finally , @xmath71-terms contribute to su(2 ) doublet mass splittings , such as the splitting between @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    ". however , these contributions are only small fractional deviations in already small mass splittings . in summary",
    ", the @xmath71-term non - decoupling effects may be relevant in certain scenarios , for example , if a heavy higgs is accessible at an @xmath2 collider .",
    "however , they do not generally appear promising as probes of heavy sector physics . in the following sections , we will therefore concentrate on measurements of the super - oblique corrections through the observables described above , that is , in processes involving gauginos .",
    "having now identified a large list of possible observables that depend on the susy couplings @xmath6 , we must determine if some of these may be measured precisely enough to be significant probes of the heavy sparticle sector . in the sections that follow , we will consider such quantitative issues in three examples that are representative in the sense that there is one example for each coupling constant relation , and one example for each of the three groups of particles given in sec .",
    "[ subsec : epem ] . here , however , we give a general description of the various errors that enter such analyses and our treatment of these errors .",
    "the uncertainties may be grouped into categories .",
    "first , there are uncertainties arising from the many unknown susy parameters that enter any given analysis .",
    "these we will call theoretical systematic uncertainties . if , for example , a measurement of super - oblique parameters is to be obtained from a cross section that depends on @xmath6 , the other parameters entering the cross section must be carefully controlled .",
    "these parameters include the masses of the particles involved , as well as the field content of these particles , for example , the gaugino content of relevant charginos and neutralinos .",
    "we will carefully study these errors , and will find that , by appealing to other measurements and exploiting various collider features , such uncertainties may be reduced to promisingly low levels .",
    "there are also uncertainties from finite experimental statistics and backgrounds .",
    "these will also be included , and we will present results for specific integrated luminosities .",
    "we assume that the backgrounds are well - understood and so may be subtracted up to statistical uncertainties .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for standard model backgrounds .",
    "of course , for certain regions of parameter space , susy backgrounds may enter .",
    "these depend on _ a priori _ unknown susy parameters , and the uncertainties associated with these are then part of the first category discussed above .    in our analyses",
    ", we have not included radiative corrections in our calculations of cross sections and branching ratios .",
    "the large logarithm radiative corrections are absorbed in the super - oblique parameters we are hoping to probe . there",
    "remain , however , radiative corrections from standard model particles , as well as the accessible superpartners . at the level of precision we will be considering",
    ", these effects may be important . however , these corrections are in principle well - known once the calculations appropriate to the scenario actually realized in nature are completed and a consistent one - loop regularization scheme is established for all relevant observables .",
    "radiative corrections dependent on the light superparticles will be subject to theoretical systematic uncertainties , but these are small relative to the theoretical systematic uncertainties entering at tree level , which were described above and will be included in our analyses .",
    "the final group of uncertainties are experimental systematic errors .",
    "these include , for example , uncertainties in luminosity , detector acceptances , initial state radiation effects , and , in some of the measurements considered below , beam polarization and @xmath79-tagging efficiency",
    ". a complete analysis would require detailed experimental simulations incorporating all of these experimental systematic uncertainties .",
    "such an analysis is beyond the scope of this work , especially since the sizes of some of these uncertainties at the nlc are unknown and are currently under investigation .",
    "we will see , however , that in some cases the experimental systematic uncertainties are likely to be negligible relative to the errors described above ; where this is not the case , we will note which experimental systematic errors appear to be most important . by estimating the sizes of the errors from the sources described in the paragraphs above , we will find interesting implications for what collider specifications are required and what features are particularly promising for the study of non - decoupling susy breaking effects .",
    "in this section , we consider a probe of the su(2 ) relation @xmath80 . recall from sec .  [",
    "sec : introduction ] that the size of deviations from this equivalence may be parametrized by the super - oblique parameter @xmath29 , which , in the two scenarios we considered , is    @xmath81    for a light sector scale @xmath82 , we see that measurements of @xmath29 to accuracies of 34% are required to be sensitive to deviations from a heavy scale @xmath83 , while determination of the heavy scale to within a factor of 3 requires measurements at the 0.80.9% level .",
    "of course , larger deviations from greater @xmath37 or additional exotic supermultiplets are possible , but we will take these figures as useful reference points .    as a test of the su(2 ) coupling relation , we turn to the first group of sparticles given in sec .  [ sec : observables ] , charginos and neutralinos , and consider chargino pair production at the nlc .",
    "this process is promising , as charginos are typically among the lighter sparticles , and they are produced with large cross section when kinematically accessible .",
    "in addition , in our scenarios , the constraint of the @xmath10 mass implies that the higgsino mass parameter @xmath84 is usually of order the third generation squark masses .",
    "this often implies that the lighter chargino and neutralinos are gaugino - like , and is exactly the region of parameter space where we have some hope of measuring @xmath48 accurately with charginos , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : observables ] .",
    "the measurement of @xmath48 from chargino production was previously considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we therefore begin with a review of those results .",

    "should induce an error in @xmath93 less than 1% .",
    "of course , if there are several comparable uncertainties , they are required to be even smaller so that their combined error is at the 1% level .",
    "the possible sources of uncertainties in measuring @xmath93 include :    \\1 .",
    "statistical fluctuation : fig .",

    "typically only a small fraction of the selectrons are produced along the beam direction ( @xmath169 for @xmath170 ) , so most of the events will survive the cuts and be detected .",

    "note , however , that if beam polarization is a dominant source of uncertainty , one may use unpolarized beams instead and run below the @xmath151 pair production threshold for a longer time to compensate the loss in cross section .",
    "the resulting increase in background is acceptable if well - understood . to compare the theoretical cross section and the total number of events , detailed monte carlo simulations incorporating effects ranging from initial state radiation and beamstrahlung to detector acceptances",

    "however , these corrections are calculable , and we expect the uncertainty to be small after the one - loop radiative corrections are included .",
    "we have not included such corrections in our calculations .",
    "lepton flavor violation : until now we have assumed that lepton flavor is conserved , as is approximately true in a wide variety of models .",
    "however , if the slepton mass matrices are not diagonalized in the same basis as the lepton mass matrix , the lepton flavor mixing matrix elements will appear at the gaugino vertices .",
    "such mixing may reduce the @xmath34 selectron pair signal and cause some uncertainties in determining @xmath52 .",

    "the fractional deviation in the @xmath34 cross section is at most @xmath178 , and so the induced uncertainty in deviation in @xmath30 is @xmath179 .",
    "if no lepton flavor violation is found , the mixing angles are therefore too small to induce significant uncertainties in @xmath30 .",
    "on the other hand , if lepton flavor violating events are discovered , the total three generation slepton production cross section may be used instead .",
    "the backgrounds will then include all 3 generations of leptons from @xmath180 decay and will be somewhat larger , but from the discussion above , we know that they are small enough at an @xmath34 collider and can be calculated anyway .",

    "as we will see , the uncertainties in @xmath163 and @xmath162 are positively - correlated and form a narrow ellipse - like region in the @xmath164 plane . at the same time , the @xmath47-channel mass insertion implies that , while the total cross section @xmath93 increases as @xmath163 decreases , it also increases as @xmath162 increases , and so the constant @xmath93 contours are approximately parallel to the major axis of the ellipse",

    "uncertainties in the measurement of @xmath257 arise from statistical fluctuations , backgrounds , and experimental systematic errors , while the extraction of @xmath250 from @xmath257 is subject to theoretical systematic uncertainties from imprecisely known susy parameters .",

    "the major theoretical systematic uncertainties are the uncertainties in @xmath258 and @xmath259 . for all measurement methods ,",

    "( [ eq : masterformula ] ) .",
    "in addition , depending on the method used to measure @xmath257 , a dependence on @xmath258 may also enter through this quantity .",
    "this is the case , for example , if @xmath257 is determined by comparing the number of events in a particular channel to the total @xmath260 cross section , and this total cross section is determined theoretically by its dependence on @xmath258 .",
    "however , the uncertainties entering from the dependence of @xmath257 on @xmath258 , in addition to being method - dependent , are typically negligible relative to other errors . for example",

    "however , these masses are expected to be much smaller than @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "the phase space factors are therefore larger for @xmath228 decays into these particles and are less sensitive to their masses .",
    "in addition , these masses will probably be known more precisely than @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "we therefore expect the uncertainties coming from these other masses to be much smaller than those from @xmath258 and @xmath259 .    in the above discussion",

    "the gluino decay is fairly phase space - suppressed , yielding roughly an equal number of gluino and wino decays .",
    "the number of events in the different channels @xmath277 is then highly sensitive to variations in @xmath28 .",
    "however , for large or very small mass splittings , either the gluino or the wino decay dominates , in which case sensitivity to @xmath28 is weak .",
    "the total error receives contributions from all three of the sources shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : msbottom][fig : blstat ] .",
    "we see that if @xmath228 squarks are produced significantly above threshold , the @xmath228 and gluino masses are measured to a few gev , and the squark - gluino mass splittings are moderate , in the range @xmath300 , the combined uncertainty is below the @xmath221 level . for nearly ideal mass splittings , the uncertainties can be much below this level , possibly yielding a precise measurement of the heavy sector scale .",
    "note , however , that possibly large experimental systematic errors have not been included .",
    "for this study , a particular source of concern is the @xmath79 tagging efficiency for multi-@xmath79 events , which must be well - understood for an accurate measurement to be possible .    before concluding , we consider briefly the possibility of measuring the super - oblique parameters through @xmath301 branching ratios . in this case , the wino decays are closed , and so only the gluino and bino modes compete .",
    "we find that the strongest bounds on @xmath27 come from the observation of squark pair events in which both squarks decay directly to binos .",
    "such decays yield clean events with only two acoplanar @xmath79 jets , and may be isolated from standard model backgrounds with simple cuts  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such cuts were found to yield efficiencies of 6080% for squark pair events . by",
    "measuring the number of double direct bino decays , and again determining the total cross section by measuring @xmath302 kinematically , bounds on @xmath27 may be found . in fig .",
    "[ fig : brstat ] , the statistical uncertainties from such a determination are given .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that in this case , a large phase space suppression of the gluino mode is required to enhance the number of double bino decay events .",
    "a statistical uncertainty at the level of @xmath221 is achievable only for @xmath303 .",
    "of course , one may also include data from multi-@xmath79 events as in the previous case , but such considerations do not improve the results noticeably .",
    "if some of the superpartners of the standard model particles are heavy and beyond the reach of planned future colliders , we must rely on indirect methods to study them before their discovery .",
    "such heavy superpartners decouple from most experimentally accessible processes . however , heavy superpartner masses break supersymmetry , and so violate the susy relations @xmath304 between gauge boson and gaugino couplings at scales below the heavy superpartner mass scale @xmath37 .",
    "deviations from these relations are most conveniently parametrized in terms of the super - oblique parameters @xmath305 @xcite and increase logarithmically with @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , precision measurements of the gaugino couplings @xmath6 in processes involving the light superpartners will provide important ( and possibly the only ) probes of the heavy superpartner sector for the foreseeable future .",
    "there are many low energy processes and observables involving the light superpartners and gauginos that depend on the gaugino couplings @xmath6 and therefore may serve as probes of the super - oblique parameters .",
    "these were systematically classified in sec .",
    "[ sec : observables ] .",
    "however , in practice , these observables are subject to many systematic and statistical uncertainties , and not all of them can be measured to the required precision to provide significant bounds on the heavy sector . in this paper , we studied three promising examples at proposed linear @xmath306 colliders , one for each of the three coupling constant relations using three different superparticles processes .",
    "we exploited the versatility of planned linear colliders , such as their highly polarized beams , tunable beam energy , and the @xmath307 option , to improve the precision of the measurements .    in the first example , chargino pair production in @xmath308 collisions was used to study the su(2 ) gaugino coupling @xmath48 . from the total cross section , the truncated forward - backward asymmetry , and a precisely measured sneutrino mass @xmath309 , measurements of the super - oblique parameter @xmath29 at the level of @xmath310 are possible .",
    "we demonstrated the importance of being able to choose an optimal beam energy so that the experimental observables are most sensitive to @xmath29 .",
    "note that , since we expect greater deviations in the su(2 ) relation than the u(1 ) relation , such results provide bounds on the heavy scale @xmath37 that are roughly equivalent to those previously achieved with @xmath149 pair production at @xmath2 colliders  @xcite .    in the second example",
    ", we considered a measurement of @xmath52 from @xmath311 production at an @xmath307 collider .",
    "such colliders allow measurements that are extremely clean both experimentally and theoretically , and therefore provide an excellent environment for precision studies .",
    "such measurements also suffer less from uncertainties in the relevant susy parameters .",
    "if the experimental systematic uncertainties are under control , @xmath312 may be measured to @xmath313 for a wide range of the parameter space .",
    "such a high precision measurement may provide a determination of the heavy scale within a factor of 3 , which is a striking improvement over the @xmath2 results described above .",
    "the last observables we considered were branching ratios of bottom squarks decay into gluinos and other gauginos .",
    "these decays can be used to measure the ratios of gaugino couplings @xmath232 and @xmath233 . although larger uncertainties are usually associated with strongly - interacting particles , the deviation from the susy relation @xmath314 is also expected to be larger .",
    "we find that , for squark production significantly above threshold and small to moderate squark - gluino mass splittings , it is possible to obtain a measurement of @xmath28 which is sensitive to deviations from the susy relation .",
    "these examples imply that the prospects for precision measurements of gaugino couplings in different scenarios are indeed promising . we have studied various possible uncertainties in these measurements and find that most of them may be controlled ( at least in some region of the parameter space ) , though a complete understanding of all uncertainties would require detailed experimental simulations that are beyond the scope of this study . for this study , it is crucial that collider parameters be well understood and precisely measured .",
    "further experimental studies on these issues are strongly encouraged .",
    "the implications of measurements of the super - oblique parameters depend strongly on what scenario is realized in nature .",
    "if some number of superpartners are not yet discovered , bounds on the super - oblique parameters may lead to bounds on the mass scale of the heavy particles .",
    "in addition , if measurements of more than one super - oblique parameter may be made , some understanding of the relative splittings in the heavy sector may be gained .",
    "inconsistencies among the measured values of the different super - oblique parameters could also point to additional inaccessible exotic particles with highly split multiplets that are not in complete representations of a grand - unified group .",
    "in addition , negative values of the parameters will imply new strong yukawa interactions involving the sm fields  @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , all superpartners of the standard model particles are found , the consistency of all super - oblique parameters with zero will be an important check of the supersymmetric model with minimal field content .",
    "if instead deviations of the super - oblique parameters from zero are found , such measurements will provide exciting evidence for new exotic sectors with highly split multiplets not far from the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "these insights could also play an important role in evaluating future proposals for colliders with even higher energies , such as the muon collider or higher energy hadron machines .",
    "in summary , if supersymmetry is discovered , the super - oblique parameters may allow powerful constraints from precision measurements on otherwise inaccessible physics .",
    "their measurement may also have wide implications for theories beyond the minimal supersymmetric standard model , just as the oblique corrections of the standard model provide strong constraints on technicolor models and other extensions of the standard model .",
