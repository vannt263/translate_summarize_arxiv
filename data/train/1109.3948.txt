    "thus , reaching consensus in the degroot model is determined by the asymptotic properties of the powers of  @xmath1 and the initial opinions .",
    "if @xmath1 is not regular , then the opinions do not generally tend to agreement .",
    "yet , consensus can be achieved if the vector of initial opinions belongs to a certain subspace .",
    "below we characterize this subspace and consider the _ method of projection _ which ensures that consensus is achieved even if the vector of initial opinions does not belong to the above - mentioned subspace .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the resulting matrix of the orthogonal projection procedure can be treated as a regularized power limit of the initial stochastic matrix .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after introducing the terminology ( section[s_notat ] ) and listing a number of well - known results used in the analysis of network dynamics ( section[s_prelim ] ) , in section[s_deso ]",

    "these sections also give the structure of the projection and the properties of the proposed method . in section[s_neorto ] , we consider some non - orthogonal projections onto the subspace of convergence to consensus . in section[s_nebaz ] , we demonstrate that in the orthogonal projection procedure ( as well as in the degroot algorithm ) , the nonbasic agents do not affect the final result . in sections[s_disj ]",
    "and[s_neba ] , the case of the absence of nonbasic agents is studied and the main result is extended to the general case .",

    "thus , arcs in @xmath17 are oriented _ in the direction of influence _ ; the weight of an arc is the power of influence .    the _ kirchhoff matrix _ ( see @xcite ) @xmath22 of digraph @xmath17 is defined as follows : if @xmath23 then @xmath24 whenever @xmath17 has the @xmath19 arc and @xmath25 otherwise ; @xmath26 @xmath27 .",

    "consequently , the kirchhoff matrices and laplacian matrices of digraphs form the same class .    by virtue of the above definitions , for the digraph @xmath17 associated with @xmath1 we have [ e_l : i - p]l()=i - p , where @xmath29 is the identity matrix .",
    "any maximal by inclusion strong ( i.e. , with mutually reachable vertices ) subgraph of a digraph is called a _ strong component _ ( or a _ bicomponent _ ) of this digraph .",
    "basic bicomponent _ is a bicomponent such that the digraph has no arcs coming into this bicomponent from outside .",

    "_ transitions occur not in the direction of the arcs of influence , but rather in the direction of agents that influence . thereby , `` all roads lead to '' the basic bicomponents , and the union of final classes is exactly the set of essential states of the corresponding markov chain . ]",
