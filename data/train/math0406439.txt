    "much attention has been given in recent years to sub - riemannian geometry ; it is a rich subject with many applications . in this paper",
    "we introduce the notion of _ sub - finsler geometry _ , a natural generalization of sub - riemannian geometry .",
    "the motivation for this generalization comes from optimal control theory .",
    "a control system is usually presented in local coordinates as an underdetermined system of ordinary differential equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the _ state _ of the system and @xmath2 represents the _ controls _ ,",
    "i.e. , variables which may be specified freely in order to  steer \" the system in a desired direction .",
    "more generally , @xmath3 and @xmath4 may take values in an @xmath5-dimensional manifold @xmath6 and an @xmath7-dimensional manifold @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "typically there are constraints on how the system may be  steered \" from one state to another , so that @xmath9 .",
    "the systems of greatest interest are _ controllable _ , i.e. , given any two states @xmath10 , there exists a solution curve of connecting @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "consider the large class of systems which are linear ( but not affine linear ) in the control variables @xmath4 and depend smoothly on the state variables @xmath3 , i.e. , systems of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a matrix whose entries are arbitrary smooth functions of @xmath3 .",
    "this class is by no means all - inclusive , but it does contain many systems of interest ; an example is given below .",
    "for such a system , _ admissible _ paths in the state space are those for which the tangent vector to the path at each point @xmath15 is contained in the subspace @xmath16 determined by the image of the @xmath17 matrix @xmath14 .",
    "often this matrix is smooth and has constant rank @xmath7 , in which case @xmath18 is a rank @xmath7 distribution on @xmath6 .",
    "( in this case the variables @xmath19 may be regarded as local coordinates on the distribution @xmath20 . )",
    "thus the admissible paths in the state space are precisely the _ horizontal curves _ of the distribution @xmath18 , i.e. , curves whose tangent vectors at each point are contained in @xmath18 . by a theorem of chow @xcite , the system is controllable if and only if the distribution @xmath18 on @xmath6 is _ bracket - generating _ ,",
    "i.e. , if the iterated brackets of vector fields contained in @xmath18 span the entire tangent space at each point @xmath15 .    given a distribution @xmath20 representing a system of the form , we next consider the problem of _ optimal control _ : what is the most efficient path between two given points in @xmath6 ? in order to answer this question , we must have some measure of the cost required to move in the state space .",
    "this measure is typically specified by a first - order lagrangian functional @xmath21 defined on the horizontal curves of @xmath18 : given a horizontal curve @xmath22 \\to { { \\euscript x}}$ ] , the _ action _",
    "@xmath23 is defined to be @xmath24 where , since @xmath25 is a solution curve of , we define @xmath26 .",
    "often the lagrangian has the form @xmath27 ( summation on repeated indices being understood ) , and in this case it defines a _ sub - riemannian metric _",
    "@xmath28 on @xmath18 ( i.e. , a riemannian metric on each subspace @xmath29 ) in the obvious way .",
    "horizontal paths which minimize the action functional are precisely the geodesics of the sub - riemannian metric .",
    "[ planewheel ] consider a wheel rolling without slipping on the euclidean plane @xmath30 .",
    "the wheel s configuration can be represented by the vector @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the wheel s point of contact with the plane , @xmath33 is the angle of rotation of a marked point on the wheel from the vertical , and @xmath34 is the wheel s heading angle , i.e. , the angle made by the tangent line to the curve traced by the wheel on the plane with the @xmath3-axis . thus the state space has dimension four and is naturally isomorphic to @xmath35 .",
    "the condition that the wheel rolls without slipping is equivalent to the statement that its path @xmath36 in the state space satisfies the differential equation @xmath37 for some control functions @xmath38 .",
    "thus the velocity vector @xmath39 of any solution curve must lie in the distribution @xmath18 spanned by the vector fields @xmath40 a natural sub - riemannian metric on @xmath18 is obtained by declaring the vector fields @xmath41 to be orthonormal , i.e. , by setting @xmath42 the integral of this quadratic form measures the work done in rotating the heading angle @xmath34 at the rate @xmath43 and propelling the wheel forward at the rate @xmath44 .",
    "but what if the natural measure on horizontal curves is not the square root of a quadratic form ?",
    "for instance , suppose we modified example [ planewheel ] by rolling the wheel on an _ inclined _ plane ? ( assume that the wheel has sufficient friction to remain motionless if no energy is put into the system . ) we would expect more energy to be required to move the wheel uphill than downhill , so the natural lagrangian would not even be symmetric in @xmath4 ( i.e. , it would not satisfy the condition @xmath45 ) , let alone be the square root of a quadratic form in @xmath4 .",
    "it is not difficult to imagine examples where the dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath4 becomes quite complicated as @xmath4 changes direction .",
    "this leads us to generalize the notion of a sub - riemannian metric on @xmath20 by replacing the riemannian metric on each subspace @xmath16 with a finsler metric .",
    "recall that a _ finsler metric _ on a manifold @xmath47 is a function @xmath48 with the following properties :    1 .",
    "regularity : @xmath49 is @xmath50 on the slit tangent bundle @xmath51 .",
    "positive homogeneity : @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",
    "( here @xmath3 is any system of local coordinates on @xmath47 and @xmath32 is the corresponding canonical coordinate system on @xmath54 . )",
    "strong convexity : the @xmath55 hessian matrix @xmath56\\ ] ] is positive definite at every point of @xmath51.[strongcon ]    ( for details , see @xcite . ) in other words ,",
    "a finsler metric on a manifold @xmath47 is a smoothly varying minkowski norm on each tangent space @xmath57 .",
    "condition [ strongcon ] implies that the  unit sphere \" in each tangent space @xmath57 ( also known as the _ indicatrix _ for the finsler metric on @xmath57 ) is a smooth , strictly convex hypersurface enclosing the origin @xmath58 .",
    "the converse is almost  but not quite  true : there exist strictly convex hypersurfaces for which the corresponding hessian matrix is only positive semi - definite along a closed subset ; see @xcite for examples .",
    "we will say that a hypersurface @xmath59 which encloses the origin is _ strongly convex _ if it is the indicatrix for a minkowski norm on @xmath57 ; thus strong convexity implies strict convexity , but not vice - versa .    in the riemannian case",
    ", the indicatrix must be an ellipsoid centered at @xmath60 , but in the finsler case it may be much more general .",
    "in particular , it need not be symmetric about the origin .",
    "we are now ready to define our primary object of study .",
    "a _ sub - finsler metric _ on a smooth distribution @xmath18 of rank @xmath7 on an @xmath5-dimensional manifold @xmath6 is a smoothly varying finsler metric on each subspace @xmath16 .",
    "a _ sub - finsler manifold _ , denoted by the triple @xmath61 , is a smooth @xmath5-dimensional manifold @xmath6 equipped with a sub - finsler metric @xmath49 on a bracket - generating distribution @xmath18 of rank @xmath62 .",
    "the _ length _ of a horizontal curve @xmath63 \\to { { \\euscript x}}$ ] is @xmath64    replacing the riemannian metric on @xmath18 by a finsler metric allows more general action functionals to be considered .",
    "the rather stringent requirement that the lagrangian be the square root of a quadratic form is replaced by the more natural requirement that it be positive - homogeneous in @xmath4 ( which is necessary if the length of an oriented curve is to be independent of parametrization ) , and that it be strongly convex ( which is necessary if there are to exist locally minimizing paths in every direction ) .",
    "the problem of finding minimizing paths satisfying is equivalent to finding geodesics of the sub - finsler manifold @xmath65 .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate sub - finsler manifolds in the simplest nontrivial case : a three - dimensional manifold @xmath6 with a rank two contact distribution @xmath18 .",
    "we will work locally , and thus we will not generally concern ourselves with the issue of local vs. global existence of objects such as coordinates , vector fields , and differential forms .    in the next two sections we will review some results of hughen @xcite concerning sub - riemannian geometry in dimension three and some results of cartan @xcite concerning the geometry of finsler surfaces .",
    "we will then combine these techniques to construct a complete set of local invariants for sub - finsler manifolds in dimension three via lie cartan s method of equivalence .",
    "( see @xcite for an exposition of this method .",
    "the reader should be aware that where gardner uses left group actions , we use right group actions for greater ease of computation . )",
    "additionally , we will derive the geodesic equations , compute the jacobi operator for the second variation problem , and investigate homogeneous examples .",
    "the material in this section is taken from keener hughen s ph.d .",

    "unfortunately this thesis was never published , but some of the results are summarized in @xcite .",
