    "in the past few years , the _ _ q__bounce collaboration has developed a new quantum - technique based on ultra - cold neutrons .",
    "due to their quantum nature , neutrons can be manipulated in novel ways for gravity research . for that purpose a gravitational resonance spectroscopy ( grs ) technique",
    "has been implemented to measure the discrete energy eigenstates of ultra - cold neutrons in the gravity potential of the earth , see fig.[fig : qboun ] .",
    "the energy levels are probed , using neutrons bouncing off a horizontal mirror with increasing accuracy . in 2011  @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated that such a resonance spectroscopy can be realized by a coupling to an external resonator , i.e. , a vibrating mirror . in 2014 , the first precision measurements of gravitational quantum states with this method were presented .",
    "the energy differences between eigenstates shown in fig.[fig : qboun ] are probed with an energy resolution of 10@xmath0 ev . at this level of precision , we are able to provide constraints on any possible gravity - like interaction",
    ". then , we determined experimental limits , first , for a prominent quintessence theory ( chameleon fields ) and , second , for axions at short distances  @xcite .",
    "detailed information on an experimental realization of the quantum bouncing ball by measuring the neutron density distribution given by the wave function can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the demonstration of the neutron s quantum states in the gravity potential of the earth has been published in  @xcite .",
    "[ ]     to @xmath1 and airy - function solutions of the schrdinger equation for bound ultra - cold neutrons in the linear gravity potential of the earth .",
    "the energy eigenstates are used for gravity resonance spectroscopy and the observed transitions between energy eigenstates are indicated by black arrows.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : qboun ]    it is planned to extend the sensitivity of this method to an energy resolution of 10@xmath2ev , and in the long run to 10@xmath3ev .",
    "the resonance spectroscopy method will therefore be extended to a ramsey - like spectroscopy technique  @xcite .",
    "at this level of sensitivity , the experiment addresses some important problems of particle , nuclear and astrophysics : three of the most important current theoretical and experimental problems of cosmology and particle physics are i ) the current phase ( late  time ) acceleration of the expansion of the universe @xcite , ii ) the nature of dark energy , which accounts for about @xmath4 of the density in the universe , i.e. @xmath5 @xcite , and iii ) the possible existence and nature of torsion , providing a basis for e.g. einstein  cartan gravity @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest explanations for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe and dark energy is the introduction of the cosmological constant @xcite , which was introduced for the first time in 1917 by einstein in his paper `` _ cosmological considerations in the general theory of relativity _ ''",
    "original motivation , outdated by hubble s discovery of the expansion of the universe soon afterwards , was to obtain a static solution for the universe .",
    "however , modern quantum field theories naturally connect the cosmological constant with the vacuum  energy of quantum fields . to account for the experimentally observed expansion of the universe consistent with theories of the history of the universe , the so - called chameleon scalar fields have been introduced . to avoid any conflict with observations at terrestrial and solar system scales , the properties of these new chameleon fields have to depend on the environmental density .",
    "especially , the effective mass of the chameleon field , and therefore the effective range of its interactions , depend on the density of the environment @xcite .",
    "the chameleon field is a specific realization of _ quintessence _",
    "the chameleon field as a source of dark energy has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "in 1922 - 1925 cartan proposed a theory @xcite , which is an important generalization of einstein s general theory of relativity @xcite .",
    "in contrast to general relativity , einstein ",
    "cartan theory allows space  time to have torsion in addition to curvature , which may in principle couple to a particle spin . for a long time",
    "cartan theory was unfamiliar to physicists and did not attract any attention",
    ". in the beginning of the 60s of the last century the theory of gravitation with torsion and spin was rediscovered by kibble @xcite and sciama @xcite . from the 1970s on , einstein ",
    "cartan theory has been intensively investigated @xcite . recently",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that in the non ",
    "relativistic approximation of the dirac equation in the effective gravitational potential of the earth , a torsion ",
    "matter interaction naturally appears after taking into account also chameleon fields .",
    "such a result demonstrates that chameleon fields can also serve as an origin of space  time torsion .",
    "gravity with torsion , caused by a scalar field , was discussed in detail by hammond in the review paper @xcite .    in einstein ",
    "cartan gravity torsion appears as the antisymmetric part of the affine connection @xcite .",
    "thus , torsion is an additional natural geometrical quantity characterizing space  time geometry through spin ",
    "matter interactions @xcite@xcite .",
    "it allows to probe the rotational degrees of freedom of space  time in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "torsion may be described by a third rank tensor @xmath6 , which is antisymmetric with respect to last two indices @xmath7 .",
    "it can be represented in the following general form @xcite : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the metric and the levi  civita tensor , respectively .",
    "it possesses 24 independent degrees of freedom , which are related to a 4vector @xmath11 , a 4axial  vector @xmath12 and a 16tensor @xmath13 .",
    "the tensor degrees of freedom @xmath14 obey the constraints @xmath15 .",
    "a minimal inclusion of torsion in terms of the affine connection leads to torsion ",
    "matter interactions , caused by the 4axial degrees of freedom only . as it has been shown in @xcite the effects of the torsion axial  vector degrees of freedom are extremely small .",
    "an upper bound of @xmath16 has been obtained from the null results on measurements of lorentz invariance violation .",
    "recent measurements of neutron spin rotation in liquid @xmath17 , carried out by lehnert _",
    "@xcite , have lead to the upper bound @xmath18 on a parity violating linear combination of the time ",
    "components of the vector @xmath11 and the axial  vector @xmath12 . since the order of the time  component of the torsion axial ",
    "vector is about @xmath19 @xcite , an enhancement of the torsion ",
    "spin  neutron parity violating interaction can be attributed to a contribution of the time ",
    "component of the torsion vector @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , interactions of both the torsion vector @xmath11 and the torsion tensor @xmath13 degrees of freedom can be introduced only phenomenologically in a non  minimal way @xcite .",
    "this diminishes a little bit the predicting power of the experimental data @xcite , since the experimental quantity @xmath20 depends on some set of phenomenological parameters multiplied by the time ",
    "components of the torsion vector @xmath21 , and axial  vector , @xmath22 . nevertheless , the experimental upper bound by lehnert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite can be accepted as a hint on a possible dominance of the torsion vector degrees of freedom @xmath11 over the torsion axial ",
    "vector ones @xmath12 .",
    "concerning chameleon fields , the corresponding solutions of the non - linear equations of motion confined between two mirrors have been obtained in  @xcite and used in  @xcite in the extraction of the contribution to the transition frequencies of quantum gravitational states of ultra - cold neutrons ( ucns ) .    furthermore , the development of a version of einstein  cartan gravity with the torsion vector @xmath11 degrees of freedom introduced in a minimal way becomes meaningful and challenging .",
    "clearly , such an extension of general relativity must not contradict well  known data on the late  time acceleration of the expansion of the universe and dark energy dynamics .",
    "a possible route is using our results @xcite and taking the torsion vector components @xmath11 as the gradient of the chameleon field .",
    "such a version of a torsion gravity theory allows to retain all properties of the chameleon field , which are necessary for the explanation of the late  time acceleration of the universe expansion , dark energy dynamics and the equivalence principle @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and to extend them by chameleon  photon and chameleon  electroweak boson interactions , introduced in a minimal way .    .",
    "right : upon resonance at 280 hz , the transmission decreases with the oscillation amplitude in contrast to the detuned 160 hz . because of the damping , no revival occurs .",
    "a detailed description of the experiment can be found in  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "right : upon resonance at 280 hz , the transmission decreases with the oscillation amplitude in contrast to the detuned 160 hz . because of the damping , no revival occurs .",
    "a detailed description of the experiment can be found in  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for the experimental analysis of these chameleon induced torsion - matter interactions very sensitive experiments are needed , which need to overcome the barrier of extremely small magnitudes of the torsion degrees of freedom . as has been pointed out in @xcite and proved experimentally in @xcite , ucns , bouncing in the gravitational field of the earth above a mirror and between two mirrors can be a good laboratory for testing chameleon  matter field interactions .",
    "the quantum energy scale of ucns is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the neutron mass , the newtonian gravitational acceleration @xcite and the quantum spatial scale of ucns such as @xmath27 @xcite . in fig.[fig : qbounce ] we plot the transmission curves of the transitions between the quantum states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qboun ] .      the extraction of the upper bound of @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath33 , has been performed within chameleon field theory using the ratra  peebles potential for the chameleon self ",
    "interaction @xcite .",
    "the profiles of the chameleon field , confined between two mirrors and separated by a distance @xmath29 have been calculated in @xcite and are shown in fig.[fig : profile ] .",
    "a precision analysis of the chameleon  matter coupling constant @xmath31 can be performed by neutron interferometry as proposed by brax _",
    "_ @xcite and has been realized by lemmel _",
    "best limits on @xmath31 have been achieved by atom interferometry in  @xcite    as it is well known , the ratra ",
    "peebles potential is just one possible potential for the self  interaction of scalar fields @xmath34 .",
    "the potential can also be taken in the higgs  like form @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and in the symmetric form @xcite , respectively .",
    "the scalar field with a self  interaction potential , which is symmetric with respect to a transformation @xmath35 , is called _ symmetron_. as it has been shown in @xcite , the _",
    "_ q__bounce experiments with ucns are able to distinguish the shape of the self  interaction potential of the scalar field . in fig.[fig : shape ] we show the dependence of the shape of the self  interaction potential of the scalar field on the sensitivity of the experimental data of the _ _ q__bounce experiments .",
    "one may see that the region of accuracies @xmath36 is sensitive to the ratra ",
    "peebles potential only . in turn , the regions of accuracies @xmath37 and @xmath38 are sensitive to the scalar field theories with the higgs  like potential and the symmetron , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity of about @xmath39 is feasible in the _ _ q__bounce experiments @xcite . hence , _",
    "_ q__bounce experiments can be a good tool for measurements of the effective low  energy torsion  spin  matter ( neutron ) interactions , which can be derived from those obtained in @xcite .",
    "the use of the _ _ q__bounce experiments for measurements of torsion  spin  matter ( neutron ) interactions should be helpful to overcome the barrier of extremely small magnitudes of torsion .",
    "the new method profits from small systematic effects in such systems , mainly due to the fact that in contrast to atoms , the electric polarisability of the neutron is extremely low .",
    "neutrons are also not disturbed by short range electric forces such as van der waals or coulomb forces and other polarisability effects such as the casimir ",
    "polder interaction of ucns with reflecting mirrors .",
    "together with the neutron neutrality , this provides the key to a sensitivity of several orders of magnitude below the strength of electromagnetism .",
    "a search for a non - vanishing charge of the neutron is also possible .    hence , experimental measurements of the transition frequencies of quantum gravitational states of ucns in the _ _ q__bounce experiments @xcite and the quantum free fall of ucns together with the experimental investigations of the phase shifts of the wave functions of slow neutrons in neutron interferometry @xcite are very important tools for probing dark energy and theories of torsion gravity  @xcite",
