    "the problem of the quantum fermions scattered from schwarzschild black holes was studied either in particular cases @xcite or by using combined analytical and numerical methods @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently we performed an analytic study of this process proposing a version of partial wave analysis that allowed us to write down closed formulas for the scattering amplitudes and cross sections @xcite .",
    "the analytic approach improves our understanding of the quantum mechanisms that governs the fermion scattering by black holes .    in the present letter we would like to extend this analytic study to the problem of the dirac fermions scattered from reissner - nordstr \" om charged black holes since it seems that this problem was neglected so far .",
    "the studies performed in the existing literature have been concentrating manly on scalar field @xcite and electromagnetic scattering @xcite on charged black holes . for these reasons we concentrate in studding the problem of fermion scattering on a reissner - nordstr \" om charged black hole by using analytically and graphically methods .",
    "this phenomenon could be interesting since along side with the gravitational interaction we can study the effect of the interaction between the charges of the black hole and the fermion charge upon the scattering process .",
    "in addition the results related to the fermion absorbtion by the schwarzschild black hole will be modified depending on the electric atraction / repulsion between the black hole charges and the fermion charge .",
    "we deduce the asymptotic form of the dirac spinors in the reissner - nordstr \" om geometry deriving the phase shifts and the partial amplitudes of elastic scattering as well as the absorption cross section .",
    "we present the principal analytic results without extended examples or comments that exceed the space of this short paper .",

    "we have shown @xcite that in the gauge we consider here the spherical variables of the dirac equation can be separated just as in the case of the central problems in minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "consequently , the particle - like energy eigenspinors of energy @xmath30 , @xmath31\\,,\\label{(u)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are expressed in terms of radial wave functions , @xmath32 , and usual four - component angular spinors @xmath33 @xcite .",

    "@xcite @xmath38 is of opposite sign ) .",
    "we note that the antiparticle - like energy eigenspinors can be obtained directly using the charge conjugation as in the flat case @xcite .",
    "thus the problem of the angular motion is completely solved remaining with a pair of radial wave functions , @xmath39 , ( denoted from now on without indices ) which satisfy two radial equations that can be written in compact form as the eigenvalue problem @xmath40 of the radial hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath41 in the space of two - component vectors , @xmath42 , equipped with the radial scalar product @xcite @xmath43    the resulting radial problem can not be solved analytically as it stays such that we are forced to resort to the same method of approximation as in ref .",

    "coordinate corresponding to the event horizon of radius @xmath44 defined as @xmath45 then , by changing the variable , multiplying with @xmath46 and introducing the notations @xmath47 we rewrite the exact radial problem in the form @xmath48 where the new matrix operator ( [ rrr ] ) @xmath49 is suitable for further approximations .    for very large values of @xmath50 , we can use the taylor expansion of these equations with respect to @xmath51 neglecting the terms of the order @xmath52 .",

    "the scattering of dirac fermions on a charged black hole is described by the energy eigenspinor @xmath70 whose asymptotic form , @xmath71 for @xmath72 ( where the gravitational and coulomb fields vanish ) is given by the plane wave spinor of momentum @xmath73 and the free spherical spinors of the flat case behaving as @xmath74 since in the asymptotic zone the fermion energy is that of special relativity , @xmath75 . here",

    "the absorption is present in the partial waves for which we have @xmath112 here we meet a branch point in @xmath113 and two solutions @xmath114 , among them we must chose @xmath115 since only in this manner we select the physical case of @xmath116 . more specific , by substituting @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) we obtain the simple closed form @xmath117 since @xmath118 for any @xmath119 obeying the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we can verify that in the limit of the large momentum ( or energy ) the absorption tends to become maximal since @xmath120 regardless of the fermion mass .",

    "hereby we understand that the absorption arises in the partial wave @xmath36 for the values of @xmath106 ( or @xmath30 ) satisfying the condition @xmath125 .",
    "this means that for any fixed value of @xmath36 there is a threshold , @xmath126 , defined as the positive solution of the equation @xmath127 was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for absorbtion on a dilaton black hole .",
    "this indicates that the fermions with @xmath128 can be absorbed by black hole only if @xmath129 .",
    "the existence of these thresholds is important since these keep under control the effect of the singularities in @xmath94 .",
    "finally , we observe that in the high - energy limit all these absorption cross sections tend to the event horizon ( apparent ) area , indifferent on the fermion mass @xmath130 , as it results from eq .",
    "( [ lims ] ) that yields @xmath131 since @xmath132 .",
    "let us now discuss some physical consequences of our results encapsulated by the formulas presented in the previous sections . for a better understanding of the analytical results we perform a graphical analysis of the differential cross section in terms of scattering angle @xmath77 .",
    "all the plots are obtained using the methods described in ref.@xcite where we used a technique proposed some time ago by yennie et al.@xcite . in what follows we focus our analysis on scattering from small or micro black holes ( with @xmath133 kg ) since in this case the wave length of the fermion ( @xmath134 ) and the schwarszchild radius ( @xmath135 ) have the same order of magnitude such that we can observe the presence of glory and orbiting scattering .    comparing the scattering cross section of a reissner - nordstr \" om black hole with that of a schwarzschild black hole ( see fig . [ fig.1 ] ) one can observe several things . first is that in the case of scattering by the reissner - nordstr \" om black hole the differential cross section will increase if the charge of the black hole and the incoming fermions charge have both the same sign ( the point and dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "thus we can say that the electric repulsion increases the scattering cross section as expected , according to ( [ condx ] ) , comparatively with the scattering on schwarzschild black hole ( the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) . in the opposite case ,",
    "when the black hole charge and the incoming fermions charge have opposite signs then the electric attraction between the two charges will make more fermions to be absorbed by the black hole lowering thus the scattering cross section comparatively with the scattering on schwarzschild black hole ( as can be seen from the doted line in fig.[fig.1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig.1 ] also revel us the fact that the width of the glory peak becomes more pronounced when the sign of the total black hole charge is the same with the charge of the fermion , respectively the glory peak s width decreases if the black hole and the fermions have opposite signs .",
    "we can conclude that when the charge of the black hole and fermions charge have the same sign , the glory scattering will be a phenomenon which becomes important comparatively with the schwarzschild case .     and @xmath136 .",
    "]     and different negative values of @xmath137 . in all plots",
    "@xmath138 represents the fine structure constant . ]    in figs .",
    "[ fig.2]-[fig.3 ] we present the differential cross section in terms of scattering angle for the reissner - nordstr \" om black hole .",
    "the effects of electric interaction ( between the black hole and fermion charges ) on the glory and orbiting scattering can be also observed .",
    "we have found that if the black hole has opposite charge than the incoming fermion then , as we increase the charge on the black hole , the glory ( i.e. backward scattering at angles close to @xmath139 ) starts to decrees up to a point when it will disappear completely ( see fig.[fig.2 ] ) .",
    "the same is true for the orbiting scattering ( i.e. scattering for @xmath140 ) for which we observe a decrees in oscillations as the black hole charge increases .",
    "this should not come as a surprise since in this case the opposite signs of the charges will increase the absorption in the black hole . on the contrary",
    "if the black hole and fermion s charges have the same sign ( see fig.[fig.3 ] ) then the glory will increase as the black hole becomes more charged .",
    "the same is true for the orbiting scattering for which the oscillatory behaviour becomes more pronounced as we add more charge on the black hole . regarding the forward scattering , we have found it to be divergent for @xmath141 as can be seen from fig . [ fig.2 ]",
    "this is in fact an effect of the long range nature of the gravitational and electric potentials , which both behave as @xmath142 .",
    "and different positive values of @xmath137 . ]     and @xmath143 .",
    "]    regarding the effects of the black hole s charge on the induced polarisation after the scattering of an initially unpolarised beam we can say according to fig . [ fig.4 ] the followings : ( i ) compared with the schwarzschild polarisation ( dotted line ) the reissner - nordstr \" om polarisation is a less oscillating function if the black hole has opposite charge that the incoming fermions ( dashed line ) , respectively the oscillations become more fervent if the black hole charge has the same sign as the incoming fermions ( solid line ) ; ( ii ) the oscillations appearing in the polarisation can be seen as resulting from the oscillatory behavior of glory / orbiting scattering as well as from the forward / backward one .     for the reissner - nordstr \" om black hole with @xmath144 and @xmath145 , for given values of angular momentum @xmath146 . ]",
    "the dependence of the absorbtion cross section in terms of energy ( @xmath147 ) , is given in fig.([fig.5 ] ) , where the plots were obtained for @xmath146 .",
    "we observe that the modes with small angular momenta have the most important contribution to the absorbtion , because as we increase @xmath36 the maxima observed in fig.([fig.5 ] ) becomes smaller .",
    "also we observe that the maxima are shifted to the right as we increase the value of @xmath36 .",
    "our graphical result for the absorbtion cross section is similar to those obtained in @xcite , where the absorbtion of scalar particles on dilaton black hole was studied .",
    "this is the basic framework of the relativistic partial wave analysis of the dirac fermions scattered by charged black holes in which we consider exclusively the contribution of the scattering modes .",
    "our results are in accordance with the newtonian limit since in the large-@xmath36 limits and for very small momentum we can take @xmath148 and @xmath149 such that our phase shifts ( [ final ] ) becomes just the newtonian ones @xcite .    the above results encapsulate a new interesting particular case namely , the dirac - coulomb scattering in the presence of the gravitational field of the charged target that gives rise to a schwarzschild gravitational field instead of a reissner - nordstr \" om one . in this situation",
    "we must take @xmath150 everywhere apart from the coulomb term such that @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
