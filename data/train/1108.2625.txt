    "the relation between the measure theoretic and topological properties of canter set and generalized cantor sets are always surprising in their own right . in addition , the real valued functions on these sets have many applications in counterexamples .",
    "for example see @xcite for interesting applications of cantor sets and the related notions .",
    "the purpose of this note is to construct a continuous function @xmath0 \\to \\bbb r$ ] which cuts the real axis uncountable times and it is not absolutely continuous . note that we say a continuous function @xmath0 \\to \\bbb r$ ] cuts the real axis at @xmath1 if @xmath2 and for each open interval of @xmath1 , there exist some points @xmath3 and @xmath4 such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "recall that a function @xmath7 \\to \\bbb r$ ] is said to be _ * absolutely continuous * _ if for each @xmath8 there exists @xmath9 such that @xmath10 whenever @xmath11 are pairwise disjoint open subintervals of @xmath12 $ ] for which @xmath13 .",
    "we construct a sequence of continuous functions on @xmath14 $ ] such that whose uniform limit is the desired function .",
    "first , divide the interval @xmath14 $ ] to three equal segments .",
    "define @xmath15 on @xmath16 $ ] as follows : @xmath17 it is easy to see that @xmath18 is continuous and it s graph is an isosceles triangle with the height @xmath19 .",
    "draw this triangle on the intervals @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] every other one , symmetrically .",
    "let @xmath22 be the function on @xmath14 $ ] whose graph is as above .",
    "from now on , our aim from upper(lower ) triangle in each step is those triangles that their corresponding function s values are positive(negative ) , respectively",
    ".    for construction of @xmath23 , fix the lower triangle drawn on the interval @xmath24 $ ] in the graph of @xmath22 and divide both intervals @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] to three equal segments .",
    "now , define the function @xmath27 on the interval @xmath28 $ ] as follows : @xmath29 it is not difficult to verify that @xmath30 is continuous and it s graph is an isosceles triangle with the height @xmath31 .",
    "now , draw this triangle on the intervals @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] every other one , symmetrically . then , copy the obtained graph on the interval @xmath34 $ ] , on the interval @xmath35 $ ] exactly and suppose that the obtained graph on the interval @xmath14 $ ] is @xmath23",
    ".    for the step 3 , fix two lower triangles drawn on the intervals @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] and accomplish the same processes in the previous steps on the intervals @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] , respectively .",
    "now , for the step @xmath42 , define @xmath43 on the interval @xmath44 $ ] as follows : @xmath45 one can verify that @xmath43 is continuous and it s graph is an isosceles triangle with the height @xmath46 and then do the same procedure in the previous steps .",
    "in fact , in this step we have @xmath47 upper isosceles triangles with the height @xmath46 and @xmath48 lower isosceles triangles which @xmath49 of them have the height @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath50 be arbitrary .",
    "then @xmath51 , for sufficiently large @xmath52 .",
    "now , using the cauchy test for uniform convergence ( see [ 1 ] ) , @xmath53 converges uniformly to a continuous functions @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , @xmath54 is a limit function which is constructed according to the construction of cantor set and thus it is identically to zero on the whole of cantor set and by the process of the construction , f cuts the real axis uncountable times .",
    "now , we show that f is not absolutely continuous .",
    "let @xmath9 be arbitrary .",
    "there exists @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .",
    "put @xmath57 and consider the sequence @xmath58 . from @xmath59 lower triangles constructed in the step @xmath60 with the height @xmath61 ,",
    "choose one of them and consider a neighborhood from the initial of the base of the triangle to the it s middle on the real line .",
    "we have @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 be arbitrary .",
    "then , @xmath64 , in which @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the points of the initial and the middle of the base of the chosen lower triangle in the step @xmath67 , respectively ; we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
