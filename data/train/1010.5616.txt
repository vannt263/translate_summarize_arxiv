    "two weak decay modes of @xmath8 hypernuclei are known , mesonic and non - mesonic ( nm ) .",
    "the latter gives a unique tool to study the baryon - baryon weak interactions .",
    "relatively little information about nm decays can be inferred by alternative processes , such as nucleon scattering experiments or parity violating nuclear transitions .",
    "the nm decay mode , in which two or more nucleons are emitted after a @xmath8-@xmath9 multibaryon weak interaction in a nuclear medium , is dominant for medium - heavy nuclei .",
    "it is characterized by a large momentum transfer ; in fact , the emitted nucleons have a momentum in the range 400600 mev/@xmath10 and can escape the nucleus . in light",
    "hypernuclei the nm decay can also lead to final states composed by two bodies only : @xmath11 some of these reactions can be interpreted as two - nucleon induced decays .",
    "finuda recently determined the two - nucleon induced nm decay to be about 1/4 of the total nm , for @xmath12-shell hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "in addition , a suppressed branching ratio for the two - body nm channels is expected because of the large momentum transfer and of the possible two - step mechanisms involved .",
    "theoretical predictions are scarce due to the very limited available data set .",
    "the only existing calculation for the two body @xmath0 decay rates was performed in 1966 by rayet @xcite , and was based on a phenomenological non - relativistic matrix elements evaluation for the @xmath13 interaction .",
    "branching ratios of 0.015 for ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and of 0.03 for ( 3 ) were predicted , with a spread within a 1.5 factor due to the dependence of the model on the nuclear density and on the @xmath8 compression effect .",
    "these evaluations are in rough agreement with the existing experimental observations , which are scarce and dated .",
    "they all belong to bubble chamber and emulsion experiments @xcite .",
    "the full present database consists of a few @xmath14 events @xcite , whose rate is 814% of all the @xmath0 nm decays , and one @xmath15 event @xcite .",
    "no @xmath16 decays were observed .",

    "was ever observed @xcite , and just one theoretical evaluation for the expected decay rates of @xmath1 exists @xcite .    in this letter",
    "the rates of the decay modes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for @xmath18 hyperfragments and ( 4 ) for @xmath19 are presented .",
    "the data were collected by the finuda spectrometer operating at the da@xmath20ne @xmath21-factory , laboratori nazionali di frascati ( lnf ) , italy .",
    "finuda is a magnetic spectrometer designed for the study of hypernuclei production and decay being induced by stopped negative kaons on targets of different composition .",
    "the apparatus features a large geometrical acceptance ( @xmath22 sr ) and an outstanding particle identification capability for charged hadrons ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 for protons and deuterons , respectively , integrated over the full momentum range for their detection : ( 180800 ) mev/@xmath10 for protons , ( 300800 ) mev/@xmath10 for deuterons ) .",
    "also thanks to the apparatus transparency an excellent momentum resolution is achieved , up to @xmath25 @xmath26 for the negative pions , of about 270 mev/@xmath10 , used in meson spectroscopy studies .",
    "finuda can not give any information about reaction ( 3 ) , since 507 mev/@xmath10 @xmath27he nuclei can not be detected by the apparatus .",
    "the ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) two - body nm decays of hyperhelium isotopes present a clear back - to - back topology for the reconstructed tracks .",
    "such a feature , along with the pid information provided by the apparatus , makes the full reconstruction of the hypernuclear decay products feasible .",
    "the signature of two - body @xmath0 decays is particularly clean . for reaction ( 1 ) , it consists of two 571.8 mev/@xmath10 monochromatic back - to - back deuterons , for reaction ( 2 ) , the two hadrons @xmath28 are back - to - back emitted with a momentum of 508 mev/@xmath10 .",

    "the unstable hypernuclei decay strongly to @xmath31 according to the reactions @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in these reactions ,",
    "the proton and the deuteron momentum is below 100 mev/@xmath10 , and their detection is not possible .",
    "however , the formation pions have a momentum in a well defined range which allows for a clear @xmath1 tagging .",
    "conversely , the @xmath34 reaction can not be studied in finuda , since a liquid helium target could not be hosted in the experimental set - up .",
    "@xmath0 hyperfragments can nevertheless be produced also in the @xmath35 interaction in nuclei with @xmath36 . in solid targets",
    "the @xmath0 hyperfragment , however , can not escape the target volume and thus be tracked , as was done in emulsion experiments @xcite . in these experiments , the measured yield of hyperfragment production in @xmath37 absorption at rest ranged from @xmath38 @xcite to the more recent values @xmath39 @xcite and @xmath40 @xcite .",

    "four of them are also used for particle identification through energy loss measurements .",

    "the systematic errors take into account the spread of the values measured in different targets of the same composition and the effect of 1@xmath81 variations in the selection criteria .",

    "an overall average yield can be deduced .",
    "the resulting value is @xmath87 , where the overall uncertainty accounts for statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature . assuming a hyperfragment production rate of about @xmath88 , roughly valid up to @xmath89 @xcite , and under the simple hypothesis that @xmath0 s are the most abundantly produced hyperfragments , this yield corresponds to an upper limit for the @xmath15 branching ratio of about @xmath90 .",
    "concerning the @xmath16 decay channel , tritons in finuda can be detected only for momenta larger than 550 mev/@xmath10 , which exceeds the momentum value expected for the two body @xmath16 decay at rest , 508 mev/@xmath10 .",

    "for this reason , a selection on the measured deuteron momentum is preferred requiring , target by target , the missing mass of the @xmath110 at rest decay to be in the range @xmath111 mev/@xmath78 : the selected events are shown in the black histogram in fig .",

    "finuda has been able to measure several features of the two - body decay channels @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath6 , thus conveying new results useful to complete the meager existing database on two - body non - mesonic decay modes of light hypernuclei . despite the limited statistics , finuda has observed signatures of decay events with a reduced background in some of the studied channels .",
    "the particle identification capabilities of the magnetic spectrometer together with its high resolution allow for the detection of a few rare events never observed before .    for @xmath15 in different targets the decay yields are of the order of a few @xmath147 , while for the @xmath3 decay channel they are some units larger .",
    "the @xmath6 decay yield of @xmath1 hypernuclei is @xmath148 .",
    "the b.r . for this decay channel has been determined for the first time to be @xmath7 .",
    "this is in rough agreement with the theoretical prediction @xcite of two orders of magnitude less as compared to the one - nucleon induced nm decay branching ratio @xcite .",
