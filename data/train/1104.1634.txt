    "this field may be identified with the quintessence field @xcite introduced to account for cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "in fact , the flatness required of the quintessence potential is naturally accommodated if quintessence is a pngb field @xcite .",
    "however , the scalar field may have nothing to do with quintessence  any pngb field is expected to have such a coupling @xcite .",
    "there may also be dark - matter mechanisms for cb @xcite .",
    "cosmological birefringence has been sought with polarized cosmological radio sources @xcite , but here we focus on cosmic - microwave - background ( cmb ) probes of cb @xcite .",
    "if the cb - rotation angle @xmath1 is uniform across the sky , as may result from the homogeneous evolution of quintessence , then there are parity - violating eb and tb correlations between the cmb temperature ( t ) and the curl - free ( e ) and curl ( b ) components of the cmb polarization @xcite .",
    "such a rotation has been sought for several years @xcite , and the tightest current limits on the rotation angle , @xmath2 ( 95%c.l . ) , come from a combined analysis of the wmap @xcite , bicep @xcite , and quad @xcite experiments @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting , in the context of the current constraints , that the uniform rotation angle is generally nonzero in quintessence models for cb , while the massless - scalar - field models have no homogeneous time evolution and thus predict no uniform rotation .",
    "it has been pointed out that @xcite , more generally , the cb - rotation might be anisotropic , giving rise to @xmath3 as a function of direction @xmath4 in the sky . refs .",
    "@xcite showed how measurement of the characteristic non - gaussianities in the cmb polarization induced by a spatially - varying cb can be used to reconstruct @xmath3 from the cmb .",
    "the current best constraint to the root - variance of @xmath1 , @xmath5 , comes from observations of active galactic nuclei @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility that cb may be correlated with primordial density perturbations and thus also with temperature fluctuations in the cmb .",
    "such correlations are to be expected , for example , if the cb - inducing field is a quintessence field with adiabatic primordial perturbations seeded during inflation . on the other hand , correlations between the cb angle and primordial perturbations may be absent",
    "if , for example , the cb - inducing field is a massless scalar  @xcite .",
    "we first work out the predictions for spatially - varying @xmath3 for a massless - scalar - field model in which there is no uniform rotation . in this case , the rotation - angle pattern @xmath3 is completely uncorrelated with the cmb - temperature pattern @xmath6 , and so we calculate only the cb - angle autocorrelation power spectrum @xmath7 .",
    "we then move on to quintessence models in which the @xmath1 t cross - correlation exists and calculate this cross - correlation power spectrum @xmath8 .",
    "we derive the minimum - variance estimators for the @xmath9 cross - correlation and estimate the detectability of cb - angle fluctuations and cb - angle  temperature correlations with current and forthcoming cmb experiments .",
    "we find that the cross - correlation can help improve the sensitivity of experiments to a signal in some cases where the signal would otherwise be only marginally detectable .",
    "we show that experiments like spider @xcite and planck @xcite may be able to detect a cross - correlation if the cb signal is near its current upper bounds , while the cross - correlation may be detectable with a future experiment , like cmbpol / epic @xcite , even if the cb power spectrum is several orders of magnitude smaller than the current upper limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : models ] we introduce the two anisotropic - cb scenarios and their parameters and calculate the corresponding @xmath10 and @xmath9 power spectra . in section  [ sec : constraints ] we discuss how @xmath1 can be reconstructed from a cmb temperature / polarization map , and then how the cross - correlations can be measured . here , we present the expressions for the minimum - variance estimators of the auto - correlation and cross - correlation power spectra , and expressions for their variances .",
    "we then evaluate those variances for spider , planck , and cmbpol / epic and estimate detectability thresholds for these three experiments . a summary and concluding remarks are presented in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "such a parity - violating term in the lagrangian introduces a modification of maxwell s equations that results in different dispersion relations for left- and right - circularly polarized photons .",
    "consequently , linearly - polarized electromagnetic waves that propagate over cosmological distances undergo cb , a frequency - independent rotation of the plane of polarization by an angle @xmath1 , where @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the change in @xmath16 over the photon trajectory , and @xmath20 is the conformal time . for the cmb ,",
