    "although the standard model ( sm ) is in spectacular agreement with the results of most terrestrial experiments , it is certainly fundamentally incomplete .",
    "the observation of neutrino oscillations has revealed that neutrinos have non - zero masses and lepton flavors are mixed@xcite .",
    "this is a conclusive evidence of new physics beyond the sm . besides",
    ", precisely cosmological observations have confirmed the existence of non - baryonic cold dark matter : @xmath3@xcite . together with the cosmic baryon asymmetry",
    ", these important discoveries can not be accommodated in the minimal sm without introducing new ingredients .    in order to generate tiny neutrino masses ,",
    "one may extend the sm by introducing three right - handed neutrinos having large majorana masses . through yukawa interactions of the right - handed neutrinos with the sm",
    "lepton doublets , three active neutrinos then acquire tiny majorana masses as given by the type - i seesaw formula : @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 is the mass matrix of light neutrinos , @xmath6 is the neutrino dirac mass matrix linking the left - handed active neutrinos with the right - handed neutrinos , @xmath7 is the mass matrix of right - handed neutrinos . actually , there are three types of tree level seesaw scenarios@xcite as well as three radiative seesaw scenarios@xcite which may generate majorana masses for active neutrinos with the help of dimension-5 weinberg operator .    compared with the tree level seesaw models , in which super - heavy seesaw particles have to be introduced , radiative seesaw models have the following two merits : ( i ) the radiative seesaw models , in which the seesaw particles are usually of the tev scale and may have large yukawa interactions with the sm particles , can be tested by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ,",
    "while the seesaw particles from the canonical tree level seesaw models are usually too heavy to be accessible with the lhc ; ( ii ) the neutral component of seesaw particles in the radiative seesaw models can be stable due to a @xmath1 discrete flavor symmetry and thus can be the cold dark matter candidate .",
    "this builds a novel connection between the dark matter and the neutrino physics .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a typical radiative seesaw model@xcite , which extends the sm with at least two @xmath8 fermion triplets @xmath0 , one inert higgs doublet @xmath9 , as well as a @xmath1 discrete flavor symmetry . assuming only @xmath0 and @xmath9 are odd under the @xmath1 symmetry and @xmath10",
    ", the @xmath11 can be the cold dark matter candidate . further assuming the gauge interactions instead of the yukawa interactions of the @xmath0",
    "dominate its annihilation and co - annihilation in the early universe .",
    "then the mass of @xmath0 as well as its scattering cross section with the nucleon can be solely determined by the dark matter relic density , as that in the minimal dark matter model@xcite . we further study constraints on the parameter space of the model through the lepton - flavor - violating processes and neutrino transition magnetic moments .",
    "our results show that the free parameters of the model can be precisely constrained by these processes .",

    "there are no dirac masses linking @xmath19 with @xmath0 due to the @xmath1 symmetry . in other words , even though @xmath0 have heavy majorana masses , the canonical seesaw mechanism is not operable",
    ". therefore the active neutrino masses can only be generated at the one - loop level with the exchange of @xmath11 and @xmath20 .",

    "by assuming @xmath10 , @xmath11 is stable and thus can be the cold dark matter candidate .",
    "since the dark matter arises as the thermal relic in the early universe , we may compute its abundance as a function of its mass .",

    "the final dark matter abundance can be well approximated as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the freeze out temperature , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at the freeze - out temperature , and @xmath28 is the total entropy .",
