    "besides the expansion of the universe and the ubiquitous presence of the fossil cosmological radiation , the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is one pilar of modern cosmology .",
    "it allows , in principle , the derivation of the baryonic density of the universe ( see for reviews schramm and turner 1998 , sarkar 1996 , 1999 and olive et al 2000 ) .",
    "the determination of light element abundances has improved dramatically in the recent past and the planned observations of @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 should allow a precise determination ( 10% is a reachable goal ) of the universal baryonic density , provided the precision of the model is made compatible with this objective .",
    "taking advantage of the release of a new compilation of thermonuclear reation rates , called nacre ( nuclear astrophysics compilation of reaction rates ) ( angulo et al 1999 ) , we have updated the standard bbn model developed at the institut dastrophysique de paris , including the analysis of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 production in the big bang .    on the other hand ,",
    "observations of light isotopes have florished : i ) @xmath21 has been observed in absorbing clouds on the sightline of remote quasars , ii ) refined observations of @xmath22 have been performed in extragalactic very metal poor hii regions and in the small magellanic cloud ( peimbert and peimbert 2000 ) , iii ) the @xmath23 abundance has been determined in two halo stars , iv ) high quality @xmath18 observations in the halo stars have been accumulated . a review of the present data can be found in olive et al ( 2000 ) and tytler et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "thus , it is timely to reassess the determination of the baryonic density of the universe in the light of advances in nuclear physics and astronomical observations .    in section",
    "ii , we present the new compilation of the reaction rates and compare it with the classical caughlan - fowler ( 1988 ) ones ; we evaluate the sensitivity of the different light element abundances to the change of each relevant reaction rate ; bbn calculations are performed using i ) recommended values of the reaction rates and ii ) extreme values obtained from the low and high rate limits . in section iii , we discuss the astrophysical status of each isotope , both observationally and theoretically in order to confront it to the bbn calculation ; we deduce the baryonic density of the universe .",
    "finally , we draw conclusion in section iv and stress the importance of precise measurements of a few key nuclear cross sections and refined abundance determinations of @xmath3 and @xmath23 .",
    "the new compilation of angulo et al ( 1999 ) of thermonuclear reaction rates for astrophysics , includes 86 charged - particle induced reactions corresponding to the proton capture reactions involved in the cold pp - chain , cno cycle , nena and mgal chains .",
    "the bbn network is constituted by about 60 reactions which participate to primordial nucleosynthesis up to @xmath24 .",
    "22 of these reactions are covered by the nacre compilation .",
    "the main innovative features of nacre with respect to the former compilation caughlan and fowler ( 1988 ) are the following : ( 1 ) detailed references are provided to the source of original data ; ( 2 ) uncertainties are analyzed in detail , realistic lower and upper bounds of the rates are provided ; ( 3 ) the rates are given in tabular form , available also electronically on the world  wide  web .",
    "for these reasons , we can adopt the nacre recommended rates for the calculation of the yields and use the upper and lower limits of the rates to test the sensitivity of the abundances to the nuclear uncertainties . as the origins for these uncertainties are documented in angulo",
    "et al ( 1999 ) , we do not discuss them here unless they show a significant effect on yields .",
    "we calculated the isotopic abundances as a function of @xmath25 between 1 and 10 , changing one single reaction at a time . for each reaction we made a calculation with the high and low nacre limits while the remaining reaction rates were set to their recommended nacre value .",
    "then we calculated , the maximum of the quantity @xmath26 within the range of @xmath25 variations for each of the 8 isotopes .",
    "positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) values correspond to higher ( resp .",
    "lower ) isotope production when the high rate is used instead of the low one .",
    "note however that following the @xmath27 definition , the positive values are not bound while the negative values are bound by -1 .",
    "hence , for instance ( see table 1 ) , @xmath28 ( resp .",
    "-0.78 ) means that the isotope yield is 11 times higher ( resp .",
    "4.5 times lower ) with the high rate than with the low one .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in table 1 .",
    ".influencial reactions and their sensitivity to nuclear uncertainties [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath29 n.s . :",
    "not significant ( @xmath30 ) q@xmath31 : no tabulated reverse rates available for endoenergic reactions .    for three of these reactions",
    ", the test has not been made because the nacre compilation does not provide high and low limits for the reverse rate of endoenergic reactions ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "the reverse recommended rate can be calculated from the formulas .",
    "however , the low and high rates are only tabulated and limited down to temperatures chosen in order that the reaction rate remains above the lower limit of @xmath35 @xmath36 mol@xmath37 s@xmath37 . for @xmath38 reactions ,",
    "the reverse rate is higher than the direct tabulated one but limited by @xmath35 @xmath36 mol@xmath37 s@xmath37 times the _ reverse ratio_.    in the analysis of yield uncertainties , one should keep in mind that the guidelines for the nacre compilation favoured conservative upper and lower limits for the rates in order that the actual rate be within these limits with a high degree of confidence . for instance , when incompatible data set were present , and if the differences could not be resolved by analysing the publications alone the high and low limits were set in order to incorporate all data sets . in some case",
    "( e.g. @xmath39 ) the incompatibility is between experimental data and theoretical results making very problematic the interpretation of the rate uncertainty in term of gaussian distributions .",
    "when only an upper limit is available experimentally , as in previous compilations , its contribution is weighted by a 0 . , 0.1 and 1 .",
    "factor respectively .",
    "this again makes difficult the probabilistic interpretation of rate uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless , few nacre reaction rates are at the origin of a significant uncertainty ( table 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath40 nacre reaction rate is responsible for a 2030% uncertainty on most isotopes .",
    "it comes from the dispersion of experimental results .",
    "note that the incompatibility of the two data set at low energy reported in angulo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) has been removed after a correction factor ( schmidt et al .",
    "1996 ) has been applied to schmidt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) data to account for an unsuspected experimental bias . to check the effect of this rate update , we reiterate the nacre calculation by fitting the experimental data points up to 2  mev but with the corrected schmidt et al .",
    "( 1995,1996 ) data .",
    "since it affects only the lowest energies , it has a negligible effect in the domain of bbn ( see fig .",
    "the most dramatic effect comes from the @xmath39 reaction which induces uncertainties of a factor 22 and 11 on the @xmath41 and @xmath42b yields .",
    "this rate uncertainty originates from the discrepancy between theoretical low energy dependance of the s  factor and experimental data ( kiener et al .",
    "1991 ) obtained with the coulomb break  up technique ( see kharbach and descouvemont ( 1998 ) for a recent comparison between theories and experiment ) .",
    "this reaction clearly deserves further experimental effort .",
    "the reactions @xmath43 and @xmath44 induce a significant ( 2540% each ) uncertainty on @xmath45 production . for these reactions ,",
    "the rate uncertainties comes from the dispersion ( systematic errors ) of non resonant experimental data at low energy .",
    "uncertainties on @xmath46 isotope yields remain negligible when compared with the gap between calculated values and observational limitations . at maximum ,",
    "a factor of @xmath47 uncertainty on @xmath24 at low @xmath1 arises from the influence of the @xmath48 reaction .",
    "however , the nacre compilation covers only 22 of the 60 reactions involved in big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 yield uncertainties are most likely dominated by uncertainties in reaction rates not included in the nacre compilation .    in front of the large systematic uncertainties on the observational abundance data ( section 3.1 ) ,",
    "it seems premature to elaborate complex statistical procedures to get very precise theoretical uncertainties on the primordial abundances .",
    "indeed , extensive studies have used monte - carlo techniques to estimate the theoretical uncertainties studies have used monte - carlo techniques ( krauss et al 1990 , smith et al 1993 , fiorentini et al 1998 , olive et al 2000 , nollet and burles 2000 ) .",
    "these powerfull methods have proven their efficiency in various domains ( e.g. simulations of high energy physics experiment ) provided that the probability distribution involved are known .",
    "concerning our approach , since the values given by the nacre compilation do not represent statistical confidence level , but upper and lower limits , they are not directly appropriate to monte - carlo calculations , but they include both statistical and systematic errors ( see above ) .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties performing to global calculations , one with all the reaction rates set to their lower limits , and the second one with all the reaction rates set to their higher limits ( dashed lines in figures 4 and 5 ) .",
    "this method could lead to compensation ( according to the signs of individual uncertainties displayed in table 1 ) between production and destruction and therefore to underestimate the global uncertainties in some cases .",
    "the advantage of this technique is simplicity and transparency .",
    "but the disadvantage is that it does not allow to derive a confidence level , in the statistical sense .",
    "the primordial abundances of the light elements @xmath3 , @xmath49 and @xmath18 are governed by the expansion rate of the universe and the cooling it induces . under the classical assumptions , ( homogeneity and the isotropy of the universe and standard particle physics : three light neutrino species , neutron lifetime equal to 887 seconds ) the abundances depend only on the baryon to photon ratio @xmath1 , related to the baryonic parameter by @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( see e.g. for details olive et al 2000 ) .",
    "we do not include the small corrections on the @xmath22 mass fraction due to coulomb , radiative and finite temperature effects , finite nucleon mass effects and differential neutrino heating ( sarkar 1999 , lopez and turner 1999 ) since these corrections lead to effects much less than the uncertainties on the observational data .",
    "the network extends up to @xmath52 ( decaying into @xmath24 ) , the leakage is taken into account through the reaction @xmath53 .    in figures 2 and 3 , we compare the results obtained with i ) the nacre recommended reaction rates ( solid lines ) and ii ) the cf88 ones ( dashed lines ) .",
    "there is no significant difference except for @xmath18 at high @xmath1 . in this range",
    ", @xmath0 comes from @xmath54 followed by electron capture .",
    "so changes in the first rate result directly in changes of the final @xmath0 yield .",
    "@xmath55 presents the largest difference due to the @xmath56 destruction reaction rate .",
    "the nacre rate is several orders of magnitude higher due to the inclusion ( rauscher and raimann 1997 ) of a 10  kev , 5/2@xmath57 resonance .",
    "however , there is no astrophysical and cosmological consequences since @xmath55 is essentially of spallative origin ( vangioni - flam et al 2000 ) .",
    "figures 4 and 5 present the updated theoretical primordial abundances from @xmath3 to @xmath24 using the nacre compilation ( mean values and extreme ones ) .",
    "d and @xmath49 are almost not affected . due to the uncertainty of the @xmath58 , the @xmath18 abundance at @xmath59",
    "is affected by a significant error ( about 30% to be compared to the 42% one mentionned by olive et al 2000 deduced from the smith et al 1993 analysis ) . at @xmath60 ,",
    "the @xmath18 uncertainty is reduced due to improvements in the derivation of the s factor of the @xmath12 reaction ( angulo et al 1999 ) .",
    "this is the result of the high precision data provided by brune et al ( 1994 ) and spanning the entire energy range of interest to bbn nucleosynthesis . considering only the precise brune et al .",
    "( 1994 ) data would even reduce the rate uncertainty .",
    "however , in this specific case , with our method , error compensation occurs between the @xmath61 and @xmath62 reaction rates as shown in table 1 . from the same table",
    ", one sees that the maximized uncertainties are @xmath6325% .",
    "consequently on figure 4 , the uncertainty is somewhat underestimated which does not affect significantly the general conclusions . on the contrary , for @xmath59 region ,",
    "the errors on the reaction rates @xmath58 , @xmath64 add up and therefore the uncertainties are not underestimated .",
    "@xmath23 has a particularly large error bar due to the poor knowledge of @xmath65 .",
    "the maximum value of the primordial @xmath66 ( at low @xmath1 ) which is of the order of 5 . may not be out of reach of future measurements in halo stars ; it represents a factor 10 below the 6/7 value measured at present in old stars ( [ fe / h ] = -2.3 ) .",
    "the results presented here are in fair agreement with previous calculations ( thomas et al 1993 , schramm 1993 , delbourgo - salvador and vangioni - flam 1993 , vangioni - flam et al 1999 ) .",
    "we confirm that primordial abundances of @xmath46 are negligible even in the most favorable case , and spallation remains the main mechanism to produce them in the course of the galactic evolution .",
    "in the following , we decline the astrophysical observational and theoretical status of each isotope of interest and their possible evolution since the big bang in order to define reasonable error boxes to prepare the confrontation to the theoretical calculations .",
    "@xmath3 is particularly sensitive to the baryon / photon ratio , @xmath1 , and has been considered up to now as the best baryometer ( e.g. reeves 1994 ) .",
    "however , due to a certain confusion on @xmath21 abundance evaluations , both at high redshifts and in the local galaxy , some care has to be taken in the cosmological use of deuterium .",
    "let us present a brief overview of the observations .",
    "@xmath3 is measured in three astrophysical and/or cosmological sites i ) the local interstellar medium , ism ( @xmath67 ) , ii ) the protosolar nebula ( @xmath68 ) , iii ) the cosmological clouds ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "these three values serve as signposts to follow the evolution of @xmath3 in the universe and in the galaxy .",
    "deuterium , due to its fragility is completely burnt in stars .",
    "thus , if no production mechanism is at work , we must have @xmath70 .",
    "the local @xmath3 abundance , inferred from uv observations of the nearby ism , estimated to @xmath71 ( linsky et al 1995 ) , is probably not unique , ranging from 5 . to about 2 .",
    "( vidal - madjar et al 1998 , lemoine et al 1999 , vidal - madjar 2000 ) .",
    "these variations are lacking explanations .",
    "thus , there is an ambiguity on the true local @xmath21 value which , by the way , serves as a normalisation for the chemical evolutionary models .",
    "these discrepancies weaken the predictive ability of the evolutionary models to derive the primordial @xmath3 abundance .",
    "@xmath21 ratios are measured in the solar system ( jupiter , saturn , uranus , neptun , comets ) .",
    "this allows to derive a precise protosolar value of @xmath72 ( drouart et al 1999 ) , somewhat higher than the estimate of geiss and gloeckler ( 1998 ) @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath21 has also been determined in absorbing clouds on the sightlines of quasars .",
    "on one side , tytler et al ( 2000 ) ( and reference therein ) have found three absorption systems in which @xmath21 are i ) @xmath74 , ii ) @xmath75 , iii ) @xmath76 . as a fair representation of these data",
    ", we adopt the following range : 3 . to 4 .. this estimate , if identified with the primordial one , is unconfortably close to the protosolar one , since it implies a very small @xmath3 destruction all along the galactic evolution corresponding to a small variation of the star formation rate from the birth of the galaxy up to now , in contradiction with the general trend indicated by the strong increase of the cosmic star formation rate vs redshift ( @xmath77 ) ( blain et al 2000 , madau 2000 ) . on the other side , high values of @xmath21",
    "have been reported concerning the quasar qso 1718 + 4807 ( @xmath78 = 0.701 ) namely , @xmath79 according to webb et al ( 1997 ) and 8.@xmath805.7 according to tytler et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "note that the analysis of levshakov et al ( 1999 ) allowing non gaussian velocity distributions leads to lower values .",
    "consequently , we adopt a second data box bounded by 8.@xmath81 3 ..      this isotope is produced in comparable amount to that of deuterium , but at the opposite , its stellar and galactic story is not simple .",
    "its production and destruction are model dependent ( vassiliadis and woods 1993 , charbonnel 2000 ) . in spite of great effort directed to its abundance determination in hii regions and planetary nebula ( balser et al 1999 , bania and rood 2000 ) @xmath82",
    "can not be used , at the moment , as a reliable cosmic baryometer ( olive et al 1995 , galli et al 1997 ) since it is very difficult to extrapolate its abundance back to its primordial value .",
    "the primordial abundance of @xmath22 by mass , @xmath83 , is measured in low metallicity extragalactic hii regions ( for a review see kunth and ostlin 2000 ) .",
    "in addition to the primordial component , @xmath22 is also produced in stars together with oxygen and nitrogen through global stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "therefore , in order to extract the primordial component from the observational data , it is necessary to extrapolate back the observed @xmath22 value down to zero metallicity .",
    "olive , skillman and steigman ( 1997 ) selected 62 blue compact galaxies and obtained @xmath83 @xmath84 0.234 .",
    "izotov and thuan ( 1998 ) pointed out that the effect of the hei stellar absorption has more importance that previously thought and they reported @xmath85 .",
    "recently , fields and olive ( 1998 ) reanalyzed the observational data and reported @xmath86 stat , @xmath87 syst where the errors are 1 @xmath88 values . the new determination @xmath89 by peimbert and peimbert ( 2000 ) on the basis of observations of hii regions in the small magellanic cloud points towards the lowest helium value proposed by fields and olive ( 1998 ) . in this context ,",
    "two data boxes emerge : i ) @xmath90 and ii ) @xmath91 .",
    "recent advances on the determination of @xmath16 in halo stars ( spite et al 1996 , bonifacio and molaro 1997 , molaro 1999 , smith et al 1998 , ryan et al 1999a ) indicate that the spite plateau is exceptionally thin ( @xmath13 0.05 dex ) .",
    "this small dispersion , together with the presence of @xmath23 in two halo stars ( smith et al 1993 , 1998 , hobbs and thorburn 1994 , 1997 , cayrel et al 1999 ) indicate that the stellar destruction of @xmath0 if any , is very limited ( less than @xmath84 0.1 dex , see ryan et al 1999a ) .",
    "@xmath23 is however of cosmological interest since , being more fragile than @xmath18 , its mere presence in the atmosphere of halo stars confirms that @xmath0 is essentially intact in these stars ( vangioni - flam et al 1999 , fields and olive 1999 ) .",
    "this , combined with the very small dispersion around the average of the spite plateau add confidence in interpreting it as indicative of the primordial @xmath16 abundance ( especially at the lowest metallicities , where the contamination by spallation is expected to be negligible ( ryan et al 1999b ) .",
    "stellar modelisation should adapt to this constraint .",
    "indeed , simple models of lithium evolution predict little or no depletion ( deliyannis et al 1990 ) , thus conforting the primordial nature of lithium in metal poor halo stars .",
    "however , three different mechanisms of alteration of lithium in halo stars have been suggested i ) diffusion / gravitational settling ( michaud 2000 and references therein ) , ii ) rotational mixing ( chaboyer 1998 , pinsonneault et al 1999 ) and iii ) stellar winds ( vauclair and charbonnel 1995 ) .",
    "some combinations of these three mechanisms have to be envisioned .",
    "there is a paradox between the absence of dispersion and the number of the processes which could produce a potential dispersion .",
    "this implies either a curious statistical compensation or more radically , that these physical mechanisms are intrinsically irrelevant .",
    "however , metallicity independent depletion mechanisms for instance ( mixing induced by gravity waves ) can not be totally excluded ( cayrel , private communication ) .",
    "consequently , we take the observed value of the spite plateau including the observational dispersion ( @xmath92 ) to which we add 0.1 dex to account the maximum @xmath16 stellar depletion .",
    "this corresponds for the primordial lithium to the following range 1.4@xmath932.2 .",
    "this evaluation is in fair agreement with that of olive et al ( 2000 ) but it is narrower than that of tytler et al ( 2000 ) who have enlarged the limit of depletion to allow agreement with their low @xmath21 measurement .    in the following , due to the high observational quality and the large sample analyzed ( more than 70 objects ) ,",
    "@xmath18 is used as a baryometer , keeping in mind that this isotope has the pecularity to allow to possible solutions depending on the side of the lithium valley .",
    "abundance observations of elemental @xmath19 and @xmath20 in very metal poor stars in the halo have made great progresses in the recent years ( gilmore et al 1992 , duncan et al 1992 , boesgaard and king 1993 , ryan et al 1994 , duncan et al 1997 , garcia - lopez et al 1998 , primas et al 1999 , primas 2000 ) .",
    "these observations concern indeed galactic evolution ; the lowest observed values ( of the order of @xmath94 ) are much higher than the bbn calculated abundances . we confirm that bbn calculated abundances of @xmath95 , @xmath55 and @xmath24 are negligible with respect the measured ones in the more metal poor stars .",
    "the origin of these elements can be explained in term of spallation of fast carbon and oxygen in the early galaxy ( vangioni - flam et al 2000 ) .",
    "once the different error boxes corresponding to the observed isotopes abundances corrected for evolutionary effects are established , we can compare them to the predictions of the bbn calculations .",
    "as different @xmath3 and @xmath22 measurements are dichotomic , contrary to @xmath18 , we put emphasis on this last isotope to determine a possible range of baryonic densities .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , considering @xmath18 alone , two possible ranges emerge : i ) @xmath96 , ii ) @xmath97 . for h = 0.65",
    ", we get i ) @xmath98 and ii ) @xmath99 .",
    "the first range is in good concordance with the error boxes related to high @xmath3 and low @xmath22 .",
    "however , the largest measured value of @xmath21 seems excluded ( @xmath100 3 . ) .",
    "the second one , on the right side of the diagram , is in fair agreement with a lower @xmath21 ( except the lowest measured value , @xmath21 = 3 . ) and a higher @xmath22 ( except also the highest value 0.25 ) . at this stage of the analysis",
    ", we have to admit that two ranges of baryonic density have to be into account , only future observations will help to remove the ambiguity .",
    "it is worth comparing the baryonic density to that of the luminous matter ( @xmath101 ) in the universe to infer the amount of the baryonic dark matter .",
    "recent estimates of @xmath101 ranges between 0.002 and 0.004 ( salucci and persic 1999 ) , which is lower than both @xmath102 obtained .",
    "the difference makes necessary baryonic dark matter . focusing on spiral galaxies the amount of luminous matter is estimated to @xmath103 = @xmath104 ( sallucci and persic 1999 ) .",
    "considering that the dynamical mass of the halo of spiral galaxies is about ten times higher than that of the disk , the corresponding @xmath105 is about 0.015 . in both cases ( @xmath1060.015 or @xmath1060.04 )",
    "all the dark matter in the halo of our galaxy could in principle be baryonic .",
    "note that since eight years of searches for microlensing events by the macho and eros collaborations toward the magellanic clouds have revealed only a few events .",
    "the fraction of the halo in the form of dark massive compact objects , using a typical model , is estimated to only 20% by alcock et al ( 1999 ) in agreement with the limits given by lasserre et al ( 2000 ) . on the other hand , the observations of the lyman alpha forest clouds between the redshifts 0 and 5 , lead to a corresponding @xmath107 of about 0.03 ( @xmath108 ) , taking into account the uncertainty related to ionised hydrogen ( riediger , petitjean and mucket 1998 ) .",
    "this value is thought to reflect the bulk of the baryons at large scale .",
    "it is more consistent with our high @xmath107 range .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis has been studied since a long time , but it deserves permanent care since it gives access to the baryon density which is a key cosmological parameter .",
    "this work has been aimed at integrating the last development in both fields of nuclear physics and observational abundance determination of light elements .",
    "the update of the reaction rates of the bbn using the nacre compilation does not lead to crucial modifications of the general conclusions concerning the baryonic content of the universe .",
    "the average values of the abundances of isotopes of cosmological interest are in general similar to that calculated on the basis of the caughlan - fowler ( 1988 ) compilation .",
    "however , the modification of the @xmath58 reaction rate leads to a @xmath18 abundance slightly lower at @xmath59 . but",
    "the uncertainty on this reaction rate remains high ( @xmath6330% ) . at @xmath109 ,",
    "the revision of the @xmath12 reaction rate leads to a very neat reduction of the uncertainty of the calculated @xmath18 abundance .",
    "however this reaction , together with the @xmath110 , remain the main sources of the @xmath18 uncertainty at low @xmath1 .        \\5 . owing to the high observational reliability of the @xmath18 abundance data with respect to the @xmath3 data avalaible both rare and debated , we choose it as the leading baryometer , since it appears that the primitive @xmath18 is almost intact in halo stars .",
    "due to the competition between @xmath12 and @xmath112 ( e @xmath113 ) @xmath18 , the curve of @xmath18 vs @xmath1 presents a valley shape .",
    "consequently , the observational error box of @xmath18 leads to two ranges of @xmath1 : @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( corresponding to @xmath116 and @xmath117 for h=0.65 ) . in both cases ,",
    "all the dark matter in the halo of our galaxy could be baryonic .",
    "however , only a fraction of 20% is detected through microlensing events in the direction of the magellanic clouds .",
    "these two @xmath1 ranges are confronted to the other available cosmologically relevant isotopes , namely @xmath3 and @xmath22 .",
    "the first @xmath1 range agrees with a high @xmath3 and low @xmath22 values , the second range is in concordance with a low @xmath3 and high @xmath22 values . at present , none of these solutions can be excluded .",
    "\\7 . in the future , on the nuclear physics front , it would be important to ( re-)measure the @xmath65 reaction to reduce the uncertainty on the calculated @xmath23 abundance .",
    "high precision measurements over the full energy range of interest to bbn of the @xmath40 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 reactions would also reduce the uncertainty on @xmath45 abundance calculations . on the astronomical front , more data on @xmath3 in absorbing",
    "clouds on the sightlines of quasars at different redshifts are mandatory to remove the ambiguity . however , if the large scale @xmath3 dichotomy remains , it will be time to invoke specific mechanisms of @xmath3 production and destruction like photodisintegration of @xmath3 and @xmath22 by @xmath118 ray quasars ( blazars ) ( cass and vangioni - flam 1997 ) and/or nuclear spallation",
    ". the observations of @xmath23 in two halo stars has been a great progress and a determination of its abundance in very metal poor stars should be pursued .",
    "it will help to constrain even more stringently the possible lithium depletion in these stars and confort definitively the primordial status of the spite plateau .",
    "together with nuclear improvements , refined @xmath23 measurements in very metal poor stars ( possibly via the vlt ) could perhaps lead us towards the primordial @xmath23 abundance .",

    "<S> we update the big bang nucleosynthesis calculations on the basis of the recent nacre compilation of reaction rates . </S>",
    "<S> the average values of the calculated abundances of light nuclei do not differ significantly from those obtained using the previous fowler s compilation . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath0 is slightly depressed at high baryon to photon ratio @xmath1 . concerning @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> its abundance is significantly lower than the one calculated with the caughlan and fowler ( 1988 ) rates as anticipated by rauscher and raimann ( 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the uncertainties related to the nuclear reaction rates on the abundances of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath2 and @xmath8 of cosmological and astrophysical interest . </S>",
    "<S> the main uncertainty concerns the @xmath9 reaction rate affecting the synthesis of @xmath0 at rather high baryonic density and also the @xmath10 and @xmath11 reactions . on the left part of the lithium valley </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty is reduced due to the improvement of the measurement of the @xmath12 reaction rate . </S>",
    "<S> the observed abundances of the nuclei of interest are compared to the predictions of the bbn model , taking into account both observational and theoretical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the @xmath0 abundance observed in halo stars ( spite plateau ) is now determined with high precision since the thickness of this plateau appears , in the light of recent observations , exceptionnaly small ( @xmath13 0.05 dex ) . </S>",
    "<S> the potential destruction / dilution of @xmath0 in the outer layers of halo stars which could mask the true value of the primordial abundance is in full debate , but the present trend is towards a drastic reduction of the depletion factor ( about 0.10 dex ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is why we use this isotope as a preferred baryometer . </S>",
    "<S> even though much efforts have been devoted to the determination of deuterium in absorbing clouds in the line of sight of remote quasars , the statistics is very poor compared to the long series of lithium measurements . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account these lithium constraints , two possible baryonic density ranges emerge , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the first case , @xmath16 is in concordance with @xmath3 from webb et al ( 1997 ) and @xmath5 from fields and olive ( 1998 ) and peimbert and peimbert ( 2000 ) . in the second case , </S>",
    "<S> agreement is achieved with @xmath3 from tytler et al ( 2000 ) and @xmath5 from izotov and thuan ( 1998 ) .    concerning the less abundant light isotopes , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical bbn abundance of @xmath6 is affected by a large uncertainty due to the poor knowledge of the @xmath17 reaction rate . </S>",
    "<S> however , at high @xmath1 , its abundance is so low that there is little chance to determine observationally the true bbn @xmath6 abundance . </S>",
    "<S> but , at low @xmath1 , its abundance being one thousandth of that of primordial @xmath0 , 6/7 ratio measurements at very low metallicity are not totally hopeless in the future . nevertheless , in the present situation </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath6 is cosmologically relevant , though indirectly , since its mere presence in a few halo stars , corroborates the fact that it is essentially intact in these stars together with @xmath18 and thus the spite plateau can be used as such to infer the primordial @xmath0 abundance . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19 and @xmath20 abundances produced in the big bang are orders of magnitudes lower , and spallation of fast carbon and oxygen is probably their unique source , in the early galaxy . </S>"
