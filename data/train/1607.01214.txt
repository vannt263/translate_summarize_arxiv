    "orbital magnetism together with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is essential for exotic quantum states such as topological insulators and topological superconductors  @xcite . for charge neutral ultracold atoms ,",

    "<S> we propose a scheme to dynamically generate optical flux lattices with nontrivial band topology using amplitude modulated raman lasers and radio - frequency ( rf ) magnetic fields . by tuning the strength of raman and rf fields , </S>",

    "<S> these three phases are respectively corresponding to : normal insulator , topological chern insulator , and semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> nearly nondispersive bands are found to appear in the topological phase , which promises opportunities for investigating strongly correlated quantum states within a simple cold atom setup . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of our proposal is confirmed by comparing the floquet quasienergies from the evolution operator with the spectrum of the effective hamiltonian . </S>"
