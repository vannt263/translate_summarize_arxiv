    "consistent unified field theories which include gravity appear to indicate that the universe has more than four spacetime dimensions .",
    "an obvious problem which follows is how to interpret these unseen extra dimensions ?",
    "one approach that has been followed is to postulate that only four of these are observable , the extra dimensions have managed to become compact and are unobservably small .",
    "recently however there has been a tremendous amount of interest in the effective five dimensional cosmologies associated with branes , in which the fifth dimension can be macroscopic in size , yet remain unobservable at low energies . in general , these compactified spaces are assumed as part of the initial metric ansatz , and the cosmology of such metrics is then determined .",
    "although this is a natural approach to take , it does not address the issue of whether such an initial condition is to be expected in string or m -theory , for example .",
    "is there any way in which we can calculate the probability of the universe possessing such compact internal dimensions as an initial condition ?",
    "it would be of great interest if it could be shown that quantum cosmology predicts a manifold with compact extra dimensions as the most likely initial configuration .",
    "symmetry arguments usually provide a very powerful tool for determining which instanton solutions should provide the dominant contribution ( i.e. those with lowest euclidean action ) to the hartle hawking path integral @xcite , hence providing the most likely background spacetime .",
    "an example is the hawking - moss instanton , involving a scalar field @xmath0 with potential @xmath1)@xcite . assuming the potential had a stationary point at some non - zero value they obtained in four spacetime dimensions an o(5 ) symmetric instanton solution where @xmath0 is constant and the euclidean manifold is a four sphere .",
    "however , coleman and de lucia @xcite obtained an instanton solution of lower action with o(4 ) symmetry which was non - singular and corresponded to the nucleation of a bubble of true vacuum in a sea of false vacuum desitter space .",
    "it was used in the earliest versions of open inflation @xcite , because the interior of such a bubble is in fact an open universe .",
    "hawking and turok @xcite took these solutions one step further , dropping the requirement for non - singular instanton configurations ; they obtained solutions where the scalar field potential increased monotonically from a single minimum .",
    "these solutions also allowed for a natural continuation to an open universe which was inflating .",
    "moreover , although the instanton solutions themselves were singular their action was finite .",
    "indeed they demonstrated a family of solutions which had lower action than the more symmetric o(5 ) solution !",
    "the notion that the o(4 ) symmetry of the hawking - turok instanton was responsible for the low action was tested in @xcite . treating the instanton as a foliation",
    "of squashed rather than round three spheres , it was found that the o(4 ) instanton was the lowest action solution within this family . in an interesting paper garriga",
    "@xcite proposed a resolution to the problem of having a singularity in the solution ; singular instantons can arise from compactifications of regular higher dimensional instantons when viewed as lower dimensional objects .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the nature of instanton solutions for the largest range of cosmologically relevant higher dimensional metrics that have been studied to date .",
    "our results will be of relevance for the study of any higher dimensional model which involves compactifications on einstein metrics , i.e. models of string cosmology involving compactifications on tori , supergravity compactifications on spheres and string theories where the compactified dimensions are calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "in particular we will be investigating instanton solutions arising from the metric ansatz ,",
    "@xmath2 the only restriction on the @xmath3 s is that they are einstein metrics on compact manifolds ; the ricci tensor is proportional to the metric . of the many solutions that exist ,",
    "we will see how a class of these instantons may be continued to a four dimensional inflating universe , with a number of static extra dimensions .    in general",
    ", because of the non - linear nature of the equations , the solutions for the scale factors @xmath4 are obtained numerically , and from these we can study the action of the ( generically singular ) instantons .",
    "the most important result we obtain is that the family of singular instantons of this type can provide a local minima of the action for non trivial extra dimensions .",
    "however , it turns out that in all the cases we examined the action of these local minima remains _ higher _ than that of the corresponding higher dimensional hawking - turok instanton .",
    "the implication of such a result is important .",
    "the symmetry properties associated with the hawking - turok instanton appear to determine the most likely instanton configuration , at least for the cases involving einstein metrics .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows : in section ii we derive the field equations and action associated with our metric .",
    "section iii contains the results of our numerical and analytical analysis and presents the nature of the local minima of the action .",
    "it also contains the comparison of these instantons with the equivalent higher dimensional hawking - turok case and shows how the latter always lead to a lower euclidean action .",
    "section iv presents exact solutions for the case of a cosmological constant replacing the scalar field potential .",
    "we also mention the analytical continuation of our solutions to a space - time with a lorentzian signature and demonstrate the existence of solutions where the internal dimensions remain static while the four dimensional spacetime is inflating .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section v.",
    "our starting point is a manifold @xmath5 which has a metric structure imposed on it , and a scalar field @xmath0 living on it with potential @xmath6 . by using the usual torsion free , metric connection on @xmath5 we can describe the equations of motion for the metric and for @xmath0 which follow from the einstein - hilbert action .",

    "@xmath9 is the volume form and @xmath10 is the ricci scalar of the connection .    as mentioned",
    "earlier we consider the manifold @xmath5 as a foliation in euclidean time of a product of boundary - less manifolds . at any given time @xmath11 we",
    "can then write @xmath12 as a cartesian product of @xmath13 , @xmath14 each with dimension @xmath15 , where for convenience we define . to endow @xmath5 with a metric structure we start by putting a metric on each of the @xmath13 , denoted @xmath16 .",
    "the metric structure we impose on @xmath5 then follows by introducing a @xmath11 dependent scale factor , @xmath17 , for each @xmath13 ; providing information about the relative size of the @xmath13 at any given @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting metric is then given by eq .",
    "( [ m_metric ] ) .",
    "this form for the metric is very general .",
    "it includes a wide class of metrics commonly considered in cosmology , such as those leading to the coleman - de lucia instanton @xcite , kantowski - sachs instantons @xcite , hawking - turok instanton @xcite , most of the models of string cosmology arising out of compactifications on tori ( for a review see @xcite ) , compactifications of string theory on calabi - yau spaces ( for a review see @xcite ) , and some compactifications of supergravity theories on spheres ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "for example in @xcite@xcite @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a three sphere with its standard round metric .",
    "a more exotic kantowski - sachs metric was considered in @xcite , there @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the equations of motion for the scale factors are derived using the einstein - hilbert action , for which we need to calculate the components of the riemann tensor .",
    "this is made simpler by using methods from differential geometry @xcite , so we start by defining an orthonormal basis of one forms on @xmath5 .",

    "the notation for the orthonormal basis of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is such that , .",
    "so because we find",
    ". this should be unambiguous ( although it might not seem so at first glance ! ) as a barred index always appears on a quantity with a subscript @xmath27 saying which @xmath13 it lives on .",
    "the connection one forms on the @xmath13 ( @xmath28 ) are taken to be torsion free metric connections , @xmath29 the connection forms on @xmath5 satisfy similar relations @xmath30 to evaluate the connection one forms we use ( [ orth_basis ] ) to find @xmath31 where we have introduced and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath11 . taking the definition of @xmath32 in ( [ m_connection ] ) and using ( [ mi_connection ] ) for the individual @xmath13 we find @xmath33    so , if the indices on @xmath32 correspond to different @xmath13 then that connection form vanishes .",
    "we must also take care to note that @xmath34 is defined using the basis on @xmath13 ( @xmath24 ) whereas @xmath35 uses that on @xmath5 ( @xmath36 ) .",

    "as we are using an orthonormal basis , this is precisely the statement that the metrics @xmath47 are einstein metrics .",

    "we shall call the term in the curly braces of ( [ eff_action ] ) the _ reduced action_.    the preceding calculation shows that for metric ( [ m_metric ] ) to be consistent then the metrics on the @xmath13 must be einstein .",
    "given this , the evolution equations for the scale factors @xmath42 depend only on the value of the ` cosmological constants ' @xmath58 and not on the detailed topology or geometry of the manifold .",
    "this is potentially very significant , for any statements we can make about the evolution of the scale factors cover a very large class of manifolds , all those admitting an einstein metric .",

    "the main solutions of interest here are the cases where the south pole is regular and there is a curvature singularity at the north pole @xcite .",
    "other cases where both the north and south poles are singular have been studied @xcite .",
    "we shall not concentrate on these cases here as the interesting features we wish to discuss are found in the case where only the north pole is singular .    as we want the south pole to be a smooth endpoint this places conditions on the scale factors . in order to avoid a conical curvature singularity",
    "then only one scale factor may vanish there , with all others approaching a constant .",
    "we order the @xmath13 such that @xmath68 vanishes at @xmath57 , according to @xmath69 we see then that we must have @xmath70 for everything to be well defined and for the solution to be non - trivial .    before we proceed we need to know what effect the singularity is going to have on the action ; in particular , does it remain finite ? to decide this we make the assumption that at the singularity the potential is not important , although there are exceptions when exponential potentials are used @xcite .",

    "then the dominant behaviour on the left hand side of ( [ ab_constraint ] ) is @xmath74 , giving @xmath75 .",
    "the volume factor , @xmath76 ( [ eff_action ] ) , then goes linearly to zero at @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath77 is diverging as @xmath78 , @xmath0 diverges logarithmically which is slow enough that the linear volume factor renders the singularity integrable for our potential .",
    "we include some representative results below for the case of two einstein metrics of dimensions @xmath79 and @xmath80 . to be specific we have chosen to take the value of , which is the appropriate value for the round metric on s@xmath81 .",
    "we shall explain the reason for this shortly .",
    "+    [ reduced_detail ] +    the second of the plots above is a magnification of some structure on the first , showing a minima with negative reduced action .",
    "so , just as the hawking - turok instanton had a minima in the action so does this new solution which has non - trivial ` spatial ' topology .",
    "the issue we need to address now is which has a lower action and is therefore more likely as initial conditions . for this",
    "we need to know the full euclidean action rather than the reduced action , this means that the volume prefactors in ( [ eff_action ] ) must be found .",
    "naively it may seem that the total action may be made arbitrarily large and negative by choosing the einstein metrics such that the volume of the manifolds is arbitrarily large .",
    "however , a result from riemannian geometry , bishop s theorem @xcite implies that for positive @xmath82 the metric which maximises the volume of the manifold is the round sphere .",
    "so by looking at the volumes appropriate for the round metric we are looking at the lowest possible action for _ all _ instantons . the volume of s@xmath83 with the round metric is @xmath84 so for our example of @xmath79 , @xmath80 the total action is , where the reduced action of -0.048 follows from the minima of fig .",
    "2 . we now need to see how this compares to the hawking - turok solution in higher dimensions .",
    "the starting point is the metric ansatz .",
    "this corresponds to ( [ m_metric ] ) with @xmath18 and @xmath85 the round metric on s@xmath83 , which gives the equations @xmath86 the action is : @xmath87    we may get an approximate solution to these equations by following the process laid out in @xcite .",
    "to start we integrate ( [ htphi ] ) to find @xmath88 then we make the approximation that at @xmath56 the constraint equation ( [ ab_constraint ] ) yields , @xmath89 the action is then found from ( [ htact1 ] ) by taking the scalar field to be the constant , @xmath90 the next approximation is that , where .",

    "3 , where the reduced action is found for a range of dimensions .",
    "the behaviour is well explained by the approximation scheme , which describes the positions of the minima increasing as @xmath97 increases , along with the value of the reduced action which also increases with n.    [ htplot ] +    we are now in a position to compare the total action we found for the product ansatz , -11.9 , and this more symmetric case .",
    "the example we found before , fig .",
    "2 , was for a six dimensional manifold .",
    "the total action of the hawking - turok solution in six dimensions is seen from fig . 3 as @xmath98 , which is lower .",
    "we have checked this for a number of dimensions , using , and found that although a minima existed it had a higher action than the corresponding hawking - turok instanton .",
    "although this is not a proof that the lowest action will not be of the product form , we see no reason to suspect otherwise .",
    "now let us proceed to investigate analytically the behaviour of the action for a more general class of our instantons to see if we can understand why a minima appears at all .",
    "consider eqn ( [ ab_constraint ] ) .",
    "if we take p and q of ( [ alimits ] ) to both be less than one then , using our knowledge of the asymptotic behaviour of the field and scale factors , we find that near a singular pole this equation becomes ,    @xmath99    let us consider the case @xmath100 . then if we multiply eqn .",
    "( [ approx1 ] ) through by @xmath101 we find that the left hand side becomes approximately equal to the boundary term in the action squared .",
    "using this observation we can once more follow through the analysis of hawking and turok but this time the analysis will apply to the case of 2 submanifolds .",
    "the analysis here is the same as that which lead to ( [ htact1b ] ) , except that we must take in the constraint equation to find @xmath102 the next step is to make the approximation that and .",
    "the end result is that the action is approximated by the value obtained in ( [ htact2 ] ) multiplied by @xmath103 and an extra submanifold volume factor .",
    "this then explains why a valley is found in fig .",
    "2 which is parallel to the @xmath104 axis , getting deeper as @xmath104 increases . clearly the valley can not keep getting arbitrarily deep , so at some point these approximations break down .",
    "we find that the weak link in our chain of reasoning is the assumption that we make about the behaviour of the scale factors as they approach the north pole . for small @xmath104",
    "then we find that @xmath61 decreases to zero at @xmath56 , and our approximation works .",
    "when @xmath104 is larger than some critical value then instead of decreasing to zero , @xmath61 increases and diverges at @xmath56 and the approximation of treating it as a sine breaks down .",
    "the important point to take away from all this is that some of our types of instanton with a ` warp product space ' topology have local minima of action in parameter space , but the corresponding hawking turok instanton ( with appropriate dimensionality ) will still dominate over them in the semi - classical approximation to the hartle hawking wavefunction .",
    "we have seen that the metric associated with the scale factor which vanishes at @xmath55 must have , ( [ lambda_constraint ] ) .",
    "the same constraint does not apply to the other manifolds .",
    "if we were to allow then bishop s theorem does not put a limit on the total volume of the @xmath105 ; so if the reduced action had a minima with a negative value then ( [ eff_action ] ) could be made arbitrarily negative by increasing @xmath106 .",
    "we would therefore expect that _ negative values of the reduced action occur only if _ @xmath107 _ for all _ @xmath108 .",
    "we have checked this for the case of two submanifolds of various dimensions , always confirming this conjecture .",
    "the equations are simplified considerably if we actually drop the scalar field @xmath0 , and replace its potential with a cosmological constant @xmath82 .",
    "we then obtain the following analytical solutions @xcite .",
    "the first is given by ,    @xmath109    @xmath110    and for @xmath111 , @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "there is a similar solution when @xmath114 .",
    "it is also possible that @xmath115 may be taken as imaginary , in which case the trigonometric function become hyperbolic , rendering the instanton non - compact .",
    "one can still create finite size instantons in this case by introducing domain walls at some value @xmath116 .",
    "this creates a discontinuity in the gradient of @xmath68 causing the scale factor to decrease , if the wall tension is large enough .",
    "we can see that the limiting behaviour is consistent with ( [ lambda_constraint ] ) for , meaning that the metric is regular at the end points .",
    "equation ( [ const_scal ] ) also shows that if we have @xmath115 real then , and for imaginary @xmath115 .",
    "ricci flat submanifolds would mean a vanishing scale factor for that manifold , so in effect they are not present .",
    "the second analytical solution is ,    @xmath117    @xmath118    @xmath119    and for @xmath120 , @xmath121 where @xmath113 and @xmath122 although there is a similar solution when they both are equal to one .",
    "as before , if @xmath115 is imaginary we require a domain wall to make the instanton compact .",
    "this solution also requires @xmath123 and @xmath124 if the instanton is to close off in a regular manner at the ` north ' and ` south ' poles .",
    "although the majority of the instantons considered in this paper do not analytically continue to lorentzian space times where some of the dimensions are compactified we can use these analytical solutions to demonstrate that there are some that do .",
    "one subset of the solutions given above is the product of s@xmath125 with s@xmath83 .",
    "this can be analytically continued to a four dimensional desitter space with a static s@xmath83 as the internal manifold .",
    "it should be noted that the static nature of this internal manifold is not stable to perturbations .",
    "this is of course the manifestation in this context of the problem of stabilising moduli fields in cosmology .",
    "we do not attempt to resolve this difficulty here .",
    "some recent mechanisms for stabilising moduli fields in cosmology can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have derived the equations of motion for a specific warp product of general einstein metrics .",
    "the main conclusion we can draw is that instantons which continue to spaces with compact ` extra ' dimensions of the form considered here do not have lower action than the corresponding higher - dimensional hawking - turok instanton .",
    "however , non trivial minima of the action do occur if the einstein metrics _ all _ have positive @xmath126 .",
    "these results are significant : first , they seem to indicate that the symmetry arguments used by hawking and turok in their letter can be applied to higher dimensional cases . secondly , our analysis applies to a wide range of metrics and cosmological scenarios .",
    "our particular comparison of the instantons involved n - dimensional spheres as our internal compact dimensions .",
    "bishop s theorem then implies that these will provide the lowest possible action for such spacetimes with compact internal dimensions , hence our results apply to any einstein metric  they will always be beaten by the corresponding hawking - turok instantons .",
    "this result strongly suggests to us that if the initial quantum state of the universe were to be described by the ` hartle hawking proposal ' then it would be difficult to explain the presence of extra compact dimensions .",

    "<S> the metric ansatz we use is composed of a particular warp product of general einstein metrics , such as those found in a number of cosmological settings , including string cosmology , supergravity compactifications and general kaluza klein reductions . using the hartle - hawking prescription the instantons we obtain determine whether metrics involving extra compact dimensions of this type are favoured as initial conditions for the universe . specifically , we find that these product metric instantons , viewed as constrained instantons , do have a local minima in the action . </S>",
    "<S> these minima are then compared with the higher dimensional version of the hawking - turok instantons , and we argue that the latter always have lower action than those associated with these product metrics . </S>"
