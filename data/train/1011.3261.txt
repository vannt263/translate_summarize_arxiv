    "then @xmath717 since @xmath718 clearly @xmath719    let @xmath720 be the natural inclusion map from @xmath3 into the elements of @xmath721 which are zero except in the @xmath138th coordinate and @xmath722 be the projection from @xmath723 onto @xmath30 given by choosing the @xmath138th coordinate .",

    "then we have @xmath748    by lemma [ c0sum ] with @xmath749 and @xmath750 in place of @xmath3 and @xmath30 , we see that @xmath751 therefore by peczyski decomposition method @xcite and [ bpiso ] we infer @xmath752    [ iso ] @xmath753 is isomorphic to @xmath754 for @xmath755    let @xmath756 @xmath757 and @xmath758 in the previous result . recall that @xmath759 is isomorphic to @xmath760 .",
