    "we will examine the physical properties of pair - density - wave ( pdw ) sc states , sc states whose order parameters have finite momentum , which generically are non - uniform .",
    "pdw sc states have been proposed@xcite to explain many experimental features of a family of cuprate high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , notably near doping @xmath3 and the observed dynamical layer decoupling of transport properties@xcite ( both at zero and with finite magnetic fields ) , and the materials in the underdoped regime at large enough magnetic fields.@xcite evidence for pdw - type sc states has also been found in the heavy - fermion material cerhin@xmath4 at high magnetic fields.@xcite pdw states are phases in which charge ( and/or spin ) and superconductivity are intertwined with each other@xcite stripe - ordered . charge and spin stripe phases , both static or `` fluctuating '' , have been observed experimentally in htsc materials for quite some time,@xcite including the more recently observed charge - density - waves ( cdw ) in @xcite , in , @xcite , and in hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite whether pdw type phases arise in htsc other than the lanthanum materials is presently not known .",
    "however , the recent observation of a modulation of the superfluid density deep in the @xmath7-wave sc phase of by scanned josephson tunneling microscopy @xcite supports that possibility .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to establish theoretically spectroscopic properties of pdw phases that ( hopefully ) will help to identify these states .",
    "non - uniform sc states have a position - dependent complex spin - singlet order parameter field @xmath8 of the form : @xmath9 for simplicity , here we consider only states with unidirectional order with ordering wave vector @xmath10 . the generalization to more complex types of ordered patterns",
    "is straightforward .",
    "sc states with an order parameter of the form of eq . were first considered long ago by fulde and ferrell @xcite ( ff ) and larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite ( lo ) .",
    "these authors showed that in a bcs model with a zeeman coupling to an uniform external magnetic field it is possible to have a sc state with cooper pairs condensing with a finite center of mass momentum .    here",
    "we will focus on sc states with a finite ordering wave vector @xmath11 of the form of eq .",
    ", arising _ in the absence _ of an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , although the form of the order parameters is the same as in the ff and lo states , the symmetry of the system is different since time reversal invariance is not explicitly broken . in eq .",
    "we denoted by @xmath12 the order parameter for an uniform sc , and @xmath13 are the components close to the ordering wave vector @xmath14 .",
    "a multi - component order parameter of the form of eq . can describe the following phases : a ) a uniform sc state if @xmath15 and @xmath16 , b ) an ff - type state if @xmath17 but @xmath18 , c ) a pdw sc state if @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and d ) a striped sc phase if @xmath15 and @xmath21 . the pdw sc is a time - reversal invariant lo state ( with wave vector @xmath11 ) , and the ff state is a sc ( with wave vector @xmath11 ) with a spontaneously broken time - reversal invariance .",
    "the pdw state has two complex order parameters , @xmath22 , whereas the ff state has one complex order parameter field @xmath23 .",
    "the recent interest in the pdw state was motivated as a symmetry - based explanation@xcite of the dramatic layer decoupling effect discovered first in @xcite and shortly thereafter in underdoped la - based cuprate sc in magnetic fields.@xcite since then there has been an extensive effort on exploring the phenomenological consequences of this state and of its possible microscopic origins .",
    "a landau - ginzburg theory of the pdw state gives a compelling description of the observed phenomenology of , @xcite and of in magnetic fields as a consequence of the symmetry of this sc state in a material with an ltt crystal structure .",
    "one important feature of the pdw state is that it is naturally intertwined with a charge ordered state with wave vector @xmath24 ( the same relation that is seen between the cdw order and the sdw order in lbco ) .",
    "several important predictions follow from the structure of the landau - ginzburg theory.@xcite one of them is the existence of three types of topological excitations : 1 ) sc vortices , 2 ) half - vortices bound to single dislocations of the charge order , and 3 ) double dislocations of the charge order .",
    "an extension of the kosterlitz - thouless theory to a system with these topological excitations leads to the prediction of a complex phase diagram which embodies the notion of intertwined orders resulting from the proliferation of the topological defects.@xcite an interesting result is the prediction of a possible charge @xmath25 sc state in the phase diagram and a @xmath26 flux quantization in the pdw state .",
    "an extension of the landau - ginzburg theory with finite magnetic fields has shown that pdw states may arise in the vortex cores of the mixed phase,@xcite as suggested by the observation of the layer - decoupling effect@xcite in the same regime where earlier neutron scattering experiments found a magnetic - field induced sdw order.@xcite    on the other hand , in spite of some significant recent progress , the microscopic origin of pdw - type states remains a challenging problem . at the root of these problems",
    "is the fact that sc states that condense at finite wave vector can not arise as weak - coupling instabilities of a fermi liquid and , hence , can not be reliably described by mean - field bcs theory .",
    "thus , although mean - field theory does allow for pdw states to occur,@xcite the required critical couplings are typically larger than the bandwidth . hence",
    ", these sc states can arise more naturally in regimes of strong correlation .",
    "indeed , an infinite projected entangled paired states ( ipeps ) simulation of the 2d @xmath27 model finds that the uniform @xmath7-wave sc is essentially degenerate with a pdw state and with a striped sc over a wide range of dopings and of the ratio @xmath28,@xcite ( and in variational monte - carlo simulations.@xcite ) this result suggests that strongly correlated systems have a strong tendency to exhibit intertwined orders and that the pdw state may occur more broadly than was previously anticipated.@xcite however , a more recent density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) simulation of a ( frustrated ) @xmath27 model has not found evidence for such ground state degeneracy.@xcite pdw states have been proposed to be the ground state of models of strongly correlated systems , based on the concept of amperean pairing,@xcite as an explain the pseudo - gap features found in angle - resolved photoemission experiments,@xcite pdw states have been shown to arise as instabilities of spin - triplet nematic fermi fluids.@xcite pdw sc states have been shown to be the ground state of 1d systems such as the kondo - heisenberg chain@xcite and extended hubbard - heisenberg models of 2-leg ladders for certain electronic densities,@xcite and in a quasi-1d model of coupled 2-leg ladders.@xcite using a different approach , using the spin - fermion model wang and collaborators @xcite provided evidence for the coexistence of cdw and pdw orders in underdoped cuprates .    in this paper",
    "we return the problem of finding additional experimentally testable tell - tale predictions that may unambiguously identify the pdw sc state .",
    "although the recent detection of a real - space modulation of the superfluid density in deep in the @xmath7-wave sc state by scanned josephson tunneling microscopy @xcite is an encouraging development , there is so far no direct experimental evidence of the pdw state .",
    "an observation of a half - vortex ( or of the predicted anomalous flux quantization ) would certainly give strong indication of the observation of this state .",
    "here we will propose a different way to detect the pdw state .",
    "one possibility is to study the signatures of the pdw in raman spectroscopy , in momentum - resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy , and in resonant inelastic x - ray scattering . for conventional superconductors , at low temperatures the sc amplitude mode ( also referred as higgs mode in similarity to the higgs boson in high - energy physics ) can be present.@xcite for conventional superconductors ( such as nbse@xmath5 ) where the sc order parameter is uniform , the experimental signatures agree with the theoretical results.@xcite    in this paper we study the amplitude ( higgs modes ) fluctuations of the pdw order parameter . since the pdw state has two complex order parameters we expect to see two higgs modes .",
    "in addition , in a phase in which the uniform @xmath7-wave state and the pdw phase coexist ( a  striped sc \" ) a new higgs mode should appear .",
    "thus , the pattern of observed higgs modes is a signature of these sc states .",
    "in addition , in contrast to the usual uniform sc state , the fs in a pdw state is not completely gapped and instead presents fermi pockets of bogoliubov quasiparticles . on the other hand , since the fs surface in the pdw state remains largely gapless , expecting more decay channels for the higgs modes one would naively expect that the damping of the higgs modes will be stronger than in the case of the uniform sc state .",
    "however , we show below that this is not the case .",
    "as will be discussed in the following sections , the predicted damping is expected to have a comparable threshold for the pdw sc as for an uniform sc state .",
    "since the pdw states can not be studied within a weak coupling theory , here will use instead the following approach .",
    "we will postulate the existence of a pdw sc state ( the same with the other states ) described by a quantum order parameter field @xmath29 .",
    "we will assume that the quantum dynamics of this order parameter has an effective lagrangian ( without damping ) with dynamic critical exponent @xmath30 .",
    "this quantum fluctuating field will be coupled to fermion bilinears for cooper pairs with the requisite center - of - mass momentum . to simplify matters",
    "we will assume that the fermi surface of the fermions is circular ( although it is straightforward to generalize to other more physically - motivated cases ) .",
    "in particular , no assumptions on nesting will be made .",
    "theories of this type are commonly used in studies of quantum criticality in metals ( see , e.g. ref . [ ] ) .",
    "theories of this type have several parameters that describe the normal and the condensed phases , as well as a stiffness and a yukawa coupling between the fermions and the order parameter field .",
    "these details , and others , will be specified in the subsequent sections .    within this framework",
    ", we study the energies and damping of the higgs modes for a pdw state . to gain some intuition of the problem",
    ", we first analyze the case of an ff state ( i.e. , with only one ordering momentum @xmath10 ) , and extended our approach to the pdw state .",
    "our key findings are as follows .",
    "the energies of the two higgs modes are split from @xmath31 , i.e. , twice of value of the mean - field gap .",
    "the magnitude of the splitting is given by the bi - quadratic coupling of @xmath32 , and we found is generally comparable to @xmath33 .",
    "these two modes can decay via scattering into bosonic collective goldstone modes or fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "however , by gauge invariance the former process can only occur via a gradient coupling interaction , and hence is weak .",
    "the major contribution to the decay comes from scattering into fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "we found that this process has a threshold at approximately @xmath31 , and , as a result , only one of the two higgs modes are significantly damped , and the other remains sharp . since in cuprate systems , their always exist a uniform ( @xmath7-wave ) sc components at sufficiently low temperature , we also discussed the properties of the pdw higgs modes in the presence of a uniform sc order .",
    "we particularly computed their energies and damping in two limiting cases when the mixing between pdw higgs modes and uniform sc higgs mode is weak , and we found that in both limits , it remains true that only one of the two pdw higgs mode is significantly damped .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions and final remarks .",
    "the details of some calculations are presented in the appendix .",
    "as a warm - up , we first study the energy and damping of the higgs mode in a fulde - ferrel ( ff ) state , which was theoretically proposed as a superconducting state stabilized in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "such a state is characterized by a single sc order parameter @xmath35 that carries a finite momentum @xmath11 .",
    "an ff state is very similar to the pdw state , and the only difference for the pdw state is that it has sc order parameters with both @xmath36 , and hence time - reversal is preserved .",
    "the analysis of the higgs mode in an ff state serves as a good starting point for that in a pdw state . to our knowledge ,",
    "the higgs mode for an ff state has not be analyzed before .",
    "the order parameter couples with fermions via a bilinear term @xmath37 where , for simplicity , we have kept an implicit spin structure on the fermions ( which forms a singlet ) .",
    "unlike the usual superconducting order parameter , an ff order parameter does not gap the full fs , but rather renormalizes the original fs into pockets . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectralff ] , we show the simulation of the spectral function @xmath38 for a circular fs and an ff order parameter with @xmath39 . on a pocket , the nature of the quasiparticle excitations continuously vary from electron - like to hole - like . in such a state , there are two collective modes : one goldstone mode corresponding to the fluctuation of the phase of @xmath35 ( which gets  eaten \" by the electromagnetic field , and another higgs mode corresponding to the fluctuation of the magnitude of @xmath35 .",
    "the two modes are decoupled , as protected by gauge invariance , and we only focus on the higgs mode .    . ]",
    "we begin with a generic form of lagrangian for the ff state , @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the imaginary time ( for convenience with signs ) and the @xmath43 term captures the slow - varying component of the ff order parameter .",
    "minimizing eq . , we have @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "the higgs mode corresponds to the longitudinal fluctuation ( i.e. , with @xmath45 fixed ) of @xmath35 around this value . expanding the lagrangian in terms of @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a matsubara frequency and @xmath49 is the momentum deviation from the mean - field value @xmath10 .",
    "we find that the dispersion relation of the higgs mode is given by @xmath50 for optical probes such as raman scattering , we are primarily concerned with @xmath51 , and in this case @xmath52 .",
    "[ panel ( a ) ] and @xmath53 [ panel ( b ) ] . ]    furthermore , if we assume that the ff state comes from a fermi surface instability , the coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath53 can be computed via diagrams ( see fig .  [ diag1 ] ) by integrating out fermions .",
    "note that this procedure is controlled only at weak coupling as it neglects fluctuations in all other channels . however , an ff state ( and a pdw state we shall consider in the next section ) usually does not emerge as a weak coupling instability . with this important caveat in mind",

    "note that , in spirit of the ginzburg - landau expansion , we use the normal state green s functions and order parameters appear as vertices .",
    "after taking the derivative and integrating by parts in the expression for @xmath54 , we find that @xmath57 for _ any _ band structure @xmath58",
    ". the value of @xmath53 can be estimated by noticing that eq .",
    "does not contain any ir divergence because of the double poles . as a result , by dimensional analysis @xmath59 in 2d .",
    "thus , we find in this case that @xmath60 the same result can be obtained from solving the self - consistent equations ( which technically speaking is also only controlled in weak coupling ) for the higgs and goldstone modes in the ff state , which we detail in appendix [ app : ff ] .",
    "next we discuss the damping ( decay ) of the higgs mode . for a neutral superfluid , the higgs mode can weakly [ via a gradient coupling , required by gauge invariance ( see ,",
    "e.g. , refs .  ) ] decay into two massless goldstone modes , and the scattering process is associated with the masses of the higgs mode and the goldstone mode by a ward identity . however , in a superconductor , as we said , the goldstone mode is absent , since it gets absorbed ( `` eaten '' ) by the electromagnetic field , making the latter gapped at plasmon frequency via the anderson - higgs mechanism . in this case , we will only consider the damping of the higgs mode via decaying into two fermionic quasiparticles .",

    "this is a result of the frequency integral we performed in the second line , which requires the poles in @xmath67 to be located in opposite half complex planes .    to compute the damping of the modes , we need to evaluate the imaginary part of eq . .",

    "we can see from eq . and eq . that the higgs mode in the ff state is right at the threshold energy , and",
    "therefore is not damped .",
    "this may sound trivial , since it is the same as the damping of the higgs mode for a uniform sc state .",

    "surprisingly , we have found that the existence of the gapless fermionic quasiparticles can not act as a decay channel for the higgs mode .",

    "in which the goldstone mode is absent , in a pdw state a gapless goldstone mode does exist due to its coupling to the electromagnetic field .",

    "the mixing of pdw higgs modes with the sc one is negligible and we can focus on the pdw sector .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to treat sc and pdw higgs modes together and consider their mixings , which is again conceptually straightforward but technically tedious .",
    "the generic lagrangian for the coexistence of the uniform sc and the pdw has been given in ref .  .",
    "for our purposes , we focus on the pdw sector and simply replace the sc order parameter with its mean - field value @xmath137 .",

    "that the presence of a uniform sc @xmath142 further mixes and splits the two higgs modes . indeed , following a similar procedure to minimize the free energy and solve for the higgs frequencies we find , @xmath143 the coefficient @xmath144 is given by the diagram in fig .",

    "we see that the existence of a uniform sc order parameter shifts the lower higgs frequency up while keeping the other one unchanged . however , as we said , the above approach treating the pdw higgs modes separately from the sc higgs mode is only valid when their energies are not close , i.e. , either @xmath149 or @xmath150 .    as for the damping of the higgs modes , when @xmath149 , the quasiparticle spectrum is dominated by pdw order parameter , and the damping threshold remains approximately @xmath151 .",
    "as long as the shift in higgs energy caused by @xmath137 is small , only one higgs mode of the two is damped , just like in the pure pdw state . in the opposite limit @xmath150",

    "we discussed the energy and damping of the higgs modes , both from a phenomenological lagrangian for the order parameters and from a self - interacting fermionic theory .",
    "we found that , even though the fs remains largely gapless ( and reorganizes as pockets ) , the damping of higgs mode requires exceeding a threshold frequency , which is twice the gap ( @xmath31 ) due to kinematics .",
    "for the pdw state , we found that there exist two higgs modes , and due to their mixing , the energies are split from @xmath156 . as a result ,",
    "only one of the two higgs modes is damped by the coupling to the fermionic excitations .",
    "motivated by the putative pdw order in the cuprate superconductors , we also discussed the fate of the pdw higgs modes in the presence of a uniform sc order .",
    "we focused on two limiting cases where the mixing between the pdw higgs and the uniform sc higgs can be neglected , and analyzed the properties of the pdw higgs modes .",
    "we found that in the coexistence phase with uniform sc , it remains that only one of the two higgs modes is significantly damped , at least in the limit where the mixing between the pdw higgs modes and sc higgs mode can be neglected .",
    "the pdw order parameters , being in the particle - particle channel , do not directly couple to the fermion density . just like the higgs mode for the uniform superconductor nbse@xmath5",
    ", the pdw higgs modes can be detected via coupling to a cdw collective mode .",
    "since pdw orders with momentum @xmath11 break translational symmetry , a cdw order ( with ordering wave vector @xmath157 ) is naturally induced in the pdw state.@xcite we propose that these higgs modes can be observed in raman spectroscopy , in momentum resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy , and in resonant inelastic x - ray scattering , which would provide evidence for the pdw order in the cuprates .    note : after this work was completed we became aware of the recent paper by boyack , wu , anderson and levin@xcite who studied the collective mode contributions to the superfluid density in ff superconductors with a finite pairing momentum @xmath158 .",
