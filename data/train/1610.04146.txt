    "physically the vanishing real part is due to the interband transitions being pauli blocked at zero temperature .",

    "the absorbance we obtain in the structure is rather large on resonance with the plasmon , up to @xmath63 , and in contrast to the local rpa result the zero temperature absorbance is non - zero .",
    "the appearance of non - zero absorbance can be understood by considering the @xmath1 dependence of the nonlocal rpa conductivity . due to the grating structure , any given frequency couples to many @xmath1-vectors , allowing the plasmon ( also at zero temperature ) to couple to the electron - hole continuum which gives rise to a non - zero real part of the conductivity . in our model",
    "this is encoded in the fourier series expansion of the conductivity , which , for any frequency , samples many @xmath1 vectors , many of them outside the white triangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : disptemp ] .",
    "this effect does not appear in the local rpa , because the conductivity in that approximation is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence in the rpa is also responsible for the overall lowering of the reflectance peaks and transmittance dips in the rpa results compared to the local rpa results .",
    "+ we wish to once again point out that we have neglected impurities and phonons in our model and we have instead focused on the momentum dependence and the temperature effects .",
    "of course , since the temperature effect depends on the ratio @xmath34 , an obvious way to reduce the temperature effect is to go towards larger doping levels .",

    "the local rpa predicts that the reflectance peak becomes smaller for larger temperatures  this is in agreement with the behavior we observed in section [ sec : resonancepeaks ] . also , the transmittance dip becomes smaller as the temperature increases and we see that , for any temperature , there is a particular grating period for which the absorbance is @xmath63 . at a temperature of @xmath66 only gratings with small @xmath33 ( large grating distance @xmath44 ) will show scattering signatures from the plasmon resonances . + the bottom row in fig .",

    "this is in stark contrast to the smooth behavior at zero temperature in the local rpa results .",
    "the sharp features can be understood by again considering the @xmath1-dependence of the conductivity , similar to the way we understood the non - zero absorbance at zero temperature in section [ sec : resonancepeaks ] . for a given frequency",

    "this is the case for both the local rpa and the nonlocal rpa results .",

    "in conclusion , we have theoretically investigated the scattering properties of monolayer graphene on a subwavelength dielectric grating and we find that such a structure , if properly tuned , can exhibit very large reflectance and transmittance signatures when the external light is on resonance with the graphene plasmon . we have compared intrinsic plasmon properties as well as scattering results obtained by using the local rpa conductivity @xmath4 with results obtained by using the nonlocal rpa conductivity @xmath3 .",

    "the graphene is here considered as an infinitely thin conducting sheet underneath the subwavelength dielectric grating and appears as a modified boundary condition when matching the waves between the thin air film and the semi - infinite half space .",
    "+ the scattering matrix method is based on fourier decomposing the electric and magnetic fields and by matching the boundary conditions we relate the fourier amplitudes between the different regions .",
    "the periodicity is set by the grating region , here we take the dielectric function to be a periodic step function between the values @xmath105 and @xmath41 in the @xmath43 direction , with total periodicity set by the distance @xmath44 .",
    "putting the dielectric step of width @xmath42 in the middle the fourier series expansion of the dielectric function is @xmath106 we restrict our treatment to normal incidence with the incident electric field in the @xmath43 direction and the incident magnetic field in the @xmath107 direction . in our setup",

    "we get the expression for the fields in free space as @xmath142 where @xmath143 we point out that the electric field in equations and is the component along the @xmath43 axis and the magnetic field is the field along the @xmath107 axis .",
    "+                  from which we can solve @xmath148 also , since the graphene scattering problem has inversion symmetry around @xmath149 the reflection and transmission amplitudes from the other side are identical .",

    "we can now write the solution for @xmath180 as @xmath181 and according to eq .   the proper electric field is @xmath182 and according to eq .",

    "then we make sure to remove the numerically unstable behavior from the resulting equation by multiplying so that we only have @xmath192 ( and not @xmath193 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath194 and defining new variables we write this as @xmath195 where @xmath196",
    "finally we now seek the total s - matrix of both the grating structure and the graphene interface , i.e the s - matrix obtained by combining equations and . writing @xmath200 and remembering how they are defined , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gratingsetup ] , we can write down the relationships @xmath201 and the s - matrix we seek is the total s - matrix that relates @xmath202 which means we must eliminate @xmath203 . eliminating both",
    "we obtain the total s - matrix as @xmath204 with @xmath205 equations [ eq : stot]-[eq : stotfinal ] represent the final answer in our scattering matrix method .",
    "the answer is a block matrix where each block is @xmath206 , @xmath207 being the number of fourier modes used in the expansion of the fields and the grating dielectric function .",
    "since the s - matrix relates incoming fields with outgoing fields it is now simple to multiply the s - matrix with the incoming field amplitudes and read out the reflected and transmitted fields .",
    "we point out that in this paper we work in a regime such that there is only one propagating mode in the reflected field and one propagating mode in the transmitted field .",
    "all other modes are evanescent and as such they do not carry any energy away from the structure . to investigate the power flow in the direction perpendicular to the graphene , the @xmath115 direction , it is thus only necessary to determine one field component amplitude for the reflected field and one for the transmitted field .",
    "this is the reflection amplitude @xmath51 and the transmission amplitude @xmath52 used in the paper to calculate the reflectance , transmittance and absorbance .",
