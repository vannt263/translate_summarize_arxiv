    "<S> this negative contribution is also apparent in the normal state and comes from the increasing relative effect of finite frequency excitations on the real part of the low - frequency dielectric function ( e.g. the system polarizability ) and departures from the drude form due to the localizing tendencies of the normal electrons .    in the conventional mb theory , </S>",
    "<S> the real part of the superconducting state conductivity is expressed as a ratio to the normal state conductivity to normalize out the transition matrix elements between the single electron states . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the usual theory it is expected that this normal state real conductivity is flat in frequency and its imaginary part is zero as is typical for a highly disordered metal with a large scattering rate . </S>",

    "<S> it is also observed that for the most disordered samples the normalized conductivity approaches the normal state faster than the bcs prediction .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of possibilities beyond mb theory exist to explain this anomalous absorption . </S>",
    "<S> in principle , both collective modes and quasiparticle excitations may contribute . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out that , in systems with a spatial modulation of the superfluid density , one may find absorptions far below 2@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cea et al . give a similar scenario where the spectral weight may be exhibited at finite frequency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in all cases these are low - energy phase - like modes that are rendered optically active at @xmath24 by the breaking of translational symmetry in the strongly disordered system . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> we do not believe phase modes are the obvious choice to explain most of the additional absorption because it is appears to be associated with gap edge excitations , which is not necessarily a relevant energy for phase degrees of freedom . </S>",

    "<S> k ) do not have clean gap within our measured @xmath12 range .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , it was recently claimed in the study of the optical response of disordered thin films that the in - gap optical conductivity exhibited a sharp threshold that was consistent with an excitation of the amplitude of the order parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this amplitude mode , if it exists , is an analog to the famous higgs boson from particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> however , amplitude modes as such are not generically guaranteed in condensates @xcite , and in a bcs - style superconductor , amplitude modes are over damped as they are degenerate with the quasiparticle absorption edge at @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation in ref . </S>",
    "<S> was made on the basis of a specific particle - hole symmetric @xmath27 relativistic field theory@xcite where the quasiparticle energy scale is set to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear how the physics of this @xmath27 field theory connects to the bcs limit , which is obvious in our data for @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in all known circumstances in which the amplitude mode threshold can be pushed below the quasiparticle absorption edge and rendered optically active , e.g. in the limit of strong disorder or strong - coupling , particle - hole symmetry is broken which forces amplitude and phase modes to mix and a clean distinction between the excitations in different sectors is obviated . as pointed out in ref . </S>",
    "<S> there are even internal consistency issues with the possibility to see an amplitude mode optically . </S>",
    "<S> because the scalar amplitude mode only becomes optically active by being excited in conjunction with a phase mode , a coupling between sectors is necessary for an amplitude mode s observation - yet this very coupling renders the amplitude and phase modes indistinct . </S>",
    "<S> note that none of our data shows either the sharp onset or the particularly low - energy scale of the single displayed high disorder curve in ref . .    </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of the above considerations , it is clear that , with substantial tunneling conductance below @xmath0 , it is inadequate to model the optics with an mb functional that relies on a clean gap . </S>",
    "<S> tunneling measurements are an important point of comparison to optical conductivity by virtue of the fact that they probe quasiparticle effects directly and only indirectly probe collective modes through their coupling to quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the low threshold ( as compared to t@xmath3 ) of 2@xmath29 that we see in optics derives from the same sub - gap states seen below the coherence peak @xmath0 in tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite natural to expect a modification of the quasiparticle excitations of the system at high disorder . </S>",
    "<S> larkin and ovchinnikov showed that that disorder in the form of a spatially varying bcs coupling constant will give an effective pair breaking effect @xcite that maps to the abrikosov - gorkov pair breaking model caused by magnetic impurities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar mechanism may be applicable to superconductors with mesoscopic fluctuations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can model both quasiparticle properties of the optical and tunneling data in a self - consistent fashion by the model of larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the prediction was that the density of states would be homogeneously broadened from the bcs expectation with an energy gap renormalized to @xmath30 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is the average value of order parameter ( very approximately indicated in the tunneling by the energy of the coherence peaks ) and @xmath31 is a parameter that sets the strength of the effective depairing @xcite . by using @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> extracted from tunneling and @xmath29 from optics , we estimate @xmath31 for each sample we studied and plot them on the right side of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . as @xmath32 decreases , @xmath31 increases . </S>",
    "<S> although this method can qualitatively explain the lower threshold , the values of @xmath31 are systematically larger than what is predicted from theory at these @xmath32 values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this regard , the mesoscopic fluctuations may be regarded as the minimal model of disorder and other types of microscopic inhomogeneity may push @xmath31 higher . </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of this , we can compare these @xmath31 s with those extracted from direct fits of the lo model to the tunneling conductance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that although the values of @xmath31 extracted by the two methods are close , optics gives a value systematically higher . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with both recent experiments that compared the @xmath31 determined from the superfluid density with that of tunneling @xcite and recent theory @xcite that predicted ( for the 2d case , which is not necessarily applicable in our thick films ) that the @xmath31 from optics should be generally larger in this disorder range by factor of 6/ln(6@xmath33 ) ( with @xmath34 the dimensionless conductance ) due to the role of vertex corrections in transport .    to more precisely compare the lo model to the data we solved the usadel equation @xmath35 numerically with @xmath0 taken from tunneling and @xmath31 </S>",
