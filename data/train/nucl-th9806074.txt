    "a better approximation requires more real and/or complex poles . like the expansion of the r - matrix",
    ", the expansion of @xmath109 converges only very slowly , and the existence of complex poles introduces further complications .",
    "moreover , only the real poles are uniquely defined , in the sense that the energy of the complex poles and their residues depend on the choice of @xmath142 and @xmath118 . in particular , the density of complex poles near the real axis increases when a larger @xmath122 is chosen .    in the domain",

    "many of these poles have very small complex residues and their contributions to the @xmath109-matrix are negligible .    in a @xmath109-matrix fit to the data , when an additional background term is needed ,",
    "it can not be a real pole in the energy range of the data , since @xmath147 only at @xmath148 . but",
    "a real background pole at negative energy can not be excluded a priori .",
    "in fact , the energy dependence of the @xmath109-matrix background plotted in fig . 2 of @xcite shows a decreasing positive background with a concave curvature .",
    "since the energy dependence of an echo pole below threshold has also a concave curvature at positive energies , introducing such a pole into the parametrization seems to be the simplest way to get a good fit below 18 mev . with the @xmath130 and @xmath124 poles and a 3-parameter background composed of a constant and an echo pole at @xmath1430.327 mev , barker @xcite easily obtained a very good fit to the data .",
    "we checked that the @xmath109 matrix for the potential model has no such pole at negative energies and we must conclude that the three parameters of the background are only _ ad hoc _ parameters without physical meaning .    to further confirm this conjecture",
    ", we made another best fit to the data up to 40 mev using the three real poles and a pair of complex conjugate poles . with @xmath149 and @xmath150 ,",

    "the results are in table 4 and fig .",
    "they confirm that in a @xmath109 matrix fit to data with a minimal number of parameters , the background parameters are unlikely to correspond to the complex poles computed for a phase - equivalent potential model .",
    "the main advantage of an r - matrix parametrization is that @xmath153 can be expanded in terms of real pole terms because @xmath153 is an @xmath153-function in the sense of wigner .",
    "the parameters introduced in an r - matrix fit are the eigenenergies @xmath40 and the formal reduced widths @xmath42",
    ". however , this is a parametrization of @xmath95 rather than of @xmath154 .",
    "one sees in fig .",
    "3 that at @xmath155 mev @xmath95 is steadily increasing with @xmath56 and one can obtain the energies , at which @xmath156 defining the so - called observed r - matrix resonance energies .",
    "the corresponding observed reduced widths @xmath64 and the observed widths @xmath157 are obtained from eqs .",
    "( 16 ) and ( 17 ) , or , if a 1-pole approximation does not apply , from eqs .",
    "( 22 ) and ( 25 ) .",
    "do all these so - called resonance energies @xmath61 really correspond to physical resonances ?",
    "how are they compared to the resonances defined by the usual conditions @xmath158 let us first evaluate the time delay in the scattering process , which is @xmath159 @xcite , where @xmath160 ( @xmath161 being the reduced mass ) and @xmath162 - \\frac{d}{dk } \\phi ( a , e ) \\ \\ .\\ ] ] with the potential model , at @xmath71 , the two terms on the right hand side of eq .",

    "thus , @xmath166 is negative and this corresponds to a time advance , excluding a physical resonance .",
    "a similar argument holds also at @xmath167 when @xmath168 , but in ref .",
    "@xcite , the third pole at 32.9 mev was already considered as a background term .",
    "let us now see how the @xmath83 r - matrix pole appears as a complex pole of the @xmath169-matrix . designating that pole by @xmath170 , we obtained @xmath171 where @xmath172 mev is far off the real axis . with @xmath173 and @xmath174 ,",
    "one finds that @xmath170 does not add a resonant contribution to @xmath175 .    under such conditions",
    ", we must conclude that , in the best fit , @xmath176 and @xmath177 are both background poles , despite the fact that @xmath178 and @xmath90 ( like @xmath179 ) are positive .",
    "this has been confusing @xcite and , like the strong dependence of the @xmath61 on the channel radius , it is a weak point of the r - matrix parametrization .",
    "this does not concern the good quality of fits one can obtain with this method , but the physical interpretation of the parameters of the pole terms .    in a @xmath109 matrix parametrization , the approximate energies at which there are real poles of @xmath109",
    "are directly suggested by the data , since they are the energies at which @xmath180 .",
    "this is the main advantage of a @xmath109-matrix parametrization .",
    "these energies are either resonances or echo pole energies according to whether the phase shift data are increasing or decreasing at the energies concerned . in the present case ,",
    "the echo poles at 2.8 mev and 31.8 mev are only a part of the background terms of @xmath109 .",
    "at least one more background term is needed to obtain a good fit to the data .",
    "it can be a constant , a real echo pole below threshold or at higher energies than the data , or a pair of conjugate complex energy poles .",
    "the parameters of these poles , energies and residues , are no more than _ ad hoc _ parameters .",
    "they are not expected to be poles of the modified @xmath109-matrix corresponding to a potential model .",
    "this is the weak point of a @xmath109-matrix parametrization .",
    "we can summarize as follows the lessons we have learned from the present analysis of the @xmath7 scattering using the r - matrix and @xmath181-matrix methods for pratical fit procedures . in order to obtain a good fit to data , one should use as flexible parametrizations as possible , without worrying about the relation of certain parameters ( e.g. echo poles below threshold in the @xmath109-matrix or r - matrix eigenenergies and residues ) to physical quantities ( e.g. resonance parameters ) . in certain cases such",
    "a connection can not be made and some of the fit parameters are purely _ ad hoc_. nevertheless , one of the main purposes of r - matrix and @xmath109-matrix fits is to give a reasonable and physically motivated basis to extrapolate data . if both methods are used carefully , they can be expected to give similarly good parametrizations , as in the case of @xmath1c(@xmath2)@xmath3o .",
