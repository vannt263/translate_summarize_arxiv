    "two fundamental and intertwined cosmological questions are how galaxies form and come to have their present structure . the current approach to answering these questions",
    "involves comparing numerical and semi - analytical structure - formation models to a suite of critical observations of low and high redshift galaxies ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1996 , 1997 ; van den bosch 2000 ) . for nearby disk galaxies one of the salient observations which tests and constrains structure - formation models is a measurement of halo shape .",
    "an increasing number of cosmological simulations show that dark matter halos are naturally triaxial ( davis 1985 ; frenk 1988 ; dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; jing 1995 ; jing & suto 2002 ) , but other physical processes , such as the dissipative infall of gas during formation , may transform the halo into an oblate spheroid ( dubinski 1994 ) . if dark matter halos are non - spherical , then this should have an observational impact on the luminous matter in disks .",
    "theory predicts a number of observational consequences including effects on ( i ) the orbits in lopsided galaxies ( levine & sparke 1998 ; jog 1999 ; noordermeer , sparke , levine 2001 ; jog 2002 ) ; ( ii ) the formation and structure of bars and oval distortions ( athanassoula 2003 ) ; and ( iii ) non - circular motions in dark matter dominated low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( hayashi 2004 ) .",
    "triaxial halos also should beget elliptical disks ( franx & de zeeuw 1992 , jog 2000 ) . because disk asymmetries may be linked to the shape of the halo",
    ", it is interesting to measure deviations from axisymmetry . indeed , many galaxies appear to have lopsided light distributions ( e.g. , zaritsky & rix 1997 ; kornreich , haynes , lovelace 1998 ; conselice , bershady , jangren 2000 ; bournaud et al . 2005 ) ,  distributions ( e.g. baldwin , lynden - bell , sancisi 1980 ) , integrated  line - profiles ( richter & sancisi 1994 ) , or kinematic features ( e.g. , richter & sancisi 1994 ; swaters 1999 ; kornreich 2000 , chemin 2006 ) , especially in lsb galaxies ( swaters 2003 ; simon 2003 ) .",
    "however , a direct measurement of disk ellipticity is challenging because it is difficult to disentangle the intrinsic shape of galaxy disks from both projection effects and spiral structure ( e.g. rix & zaritsky 1995 ; schoenmakers 1997 , schoenmakers 1999 ; andersen 2001 ; barnes & sellwood 2003 ) .",
    "if better estimates of ellipticity existed , tighter limits could be placed on halo triaxiality .",
    "this paper describes our disk structure survey . with this survey , we attempt to constrain the halo shapes of field galaxies by measuring disk lopsidedness and ellipticity using a combination of bi - dimensional spectroscopy and imaging , complementing other work such as the fabry - perot kinematic survey of virgo cluster disk galaxies ( chemin 2006 ) . beyond the implications",
    "such asymmetry measurements have for cosmological simulations of galaxy halos , both quantities also should be sources of scatter in the tf scaling relation ( franx & de zeeuw 1992 ; zaritsky & rix 1997 ; andersen & bershady 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , a measurement of ellipticity , and possibly lopsidedness , places limits on other astrophysical sources of tf scatter , including disk mass - to - light ratios .",
    "if limits are placed on the variation of disk mass - to - light ratios , a new constraint will be placed on mass decomposition models .    in this paper",
    "we present the h@xmath0 and  kinematic data for our survey .",
    "h@xmath0 echelle observations were made with the integral field unit ( ifu ) densepak ( barden , sawyer & honeycutt 1998 ) on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope for 39 nearly face - on disk galaxies .",
    "observations for 23 of the sample come from the nanay radio telescope .",
    "the optical data forms the primary kinematic data for this survey .",
    "the purpose of the   line - profiles is to establish that the optical integral - field data amply samples the potential . while  and h@xmath0 have similar flux - weighted radial extents in many cases ( verheijen & sancisi 2001 ) , there will still exist different and varying spatial distributions and `` turbulent '' motions of ionized and neutral gas which could lead to significant differences between   and h@xmath0 integrated line - widths",
    "however , our expectations are that turbulent motions are small ; the differences between ionized and neutral turbulent motions smaller still ; and the differences in spatial distribution are mitigated by the typically flat , and steeply rising rotation curves of this sample . verifying these expectations is important for our ultimate goal of measuring halo shapes , and also allows us to address the suitability of optical line - widths as dynamical tracers of total mass .",
    "the application has relevance to studies of both nearby and distant galaxies .",
    "the combination of optical and radio data also is pertinent to understanding the origin of line - profile asymmetries .    in future papers in this series",
    "we analyze the h@xmath0 and   line - profiles , the h@xmath0 velocity fields , and the photometric properties of the survey galaxies .",
    "these studies explore the photometric and kinematic asymmetries of the galaxy sample , and their correlations .",
    "the studies build a physical picture of why asymmetries arise ; how they contribute to scatter in the tully - fisher relation ; and how well total dynamical mass can be measured in nearly face - on systems .",
    "together , they allows us to study the ellipticity distribution of our sample in a tertiary analysis .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we provide the selection algorithm in  2 .",
    "we present the densepak and nanay observations in  3 .",
    "the basic processing of the data is detailed in  4 .",
    "line - widths are also presented in  4 . in  5",
    "we describe how we combine integral - field observations to obtain h@xmath0 integrated line - widths , present measurements of turbulent motions , discuss integrated line - profiles of individual galaxies , and contrast optical and radio line - profiles .",
    "we conclude with a summary in  6 .",
    "the selection of the sample for this survey is driven by our desire to measure disk ellipticity .",
    "a 10% disk ellipticity will create differences in observable quantities which are smaller than typical measurement errors for inclined galaxies ( barnes & sellwood 2003 ; andersen , bershady , sparke 2005 ) , thereby necessitating that our sample include only nearly face  on galaxies . to illustrate this ,",
    "figure 1 shows how measurement errors on observable quantities translate into intrinsic ellipticity errors as a function of inclination .",
    "we have assumed that intrinsic ellipticity is measured via a comparison of observed photometric and kinematic position angles , photometric axis ratios , and kinematic inclinations .",
    "a description of the method is found in andersen ( 2001 ) .",
    "given the expected errors on these quantities and that the mean intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies is expected to be below 10% , galaxies with inclinations @xmath3 30@xmath4are optimum choices for intrinsic ellipticity measurements .",
    "to 3.3 in    ' '' ''    two methods exist for making a selection of nearly face  on disks : galaxies can be chosen with photometric axis ratios close to unity , or chosen with narrow  line - widths ( or other kinematic measures of rotation ) .",
    "the tully - fisher relationship can be inverted ; line widths and absolute magnitudes can used to solve for inclination ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ) .",
    "because the scatter in the tully - fisher relation is small for normal spirals , these so - called `` inverse tully - fisher '' inclinations could be used to select galaxies with inclinations less than 30@xmath4 .    choosing galaxies with existing  line - widths may bias a sample .",
    "many galaxies are selected for  observations on the basis of having photometric inclinations greater than 45@xmath4 for inclusion in tully - fisher studies . those galaxies with narrow",
    "line - widths may indeed be nearly face  on , but in this case are necessarily highly elliptic .",
    "hence surveys built upon the availability of  line - widths as a selection criterion may preferentially include spiral galaxies with elliptical disks .",
    "we therefore choose galaxies for this study based on photometric axis ratios .",
    "however , disks with the greatest ellipticities will appear nearly face  on only if the intrinsic minor axis lies near the inclination axis .",
    "this potential bias is a second - order effect which can be accounted for when modeling the distribution in ellipticities for the general population of spiral galaxies ( ryden 2004 ) .",
    "we therefore chose galaxies with axis ratios near unity .    the densepak integral field unit on",
    "the wiyn telescope spans 30 arcsec @xmath5 45 arcsec , so targets were limited to diameters ( @xmath6 ) between 45 and 75 arcseconds so they could be well sampled in a few pointings . given this relatively small size ,",
    "chosen galaxies will typically be some of the faintest and most distant galaxies in the catalogs of nearby galaxies .    to maximize the number of galaxies available for study , we chose our sample from the leda database which contains all galaxies in common catalogs ( e.g. ngc , ugc , ic ) , plus additional galaxies only defined in the principal galaxy catalog ( pgc ; paturel 1997 ) .",
    "while the pgc is inclusive of many other galaxy catalogs , galaxies with diameters less than @xmath21 arcminute still fall below the completeness threshold ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we required sample galaxies from leda to have : ( 1 ) axis ratio @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the uncertainty in the measured axial ratio @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the corresponding uncertainty in inclination as tabulated in leda .",
    "] , ( 2 ) apparent disk size @xmath11 , ( 3 ) galactic absorption @xmath12 ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) , ( 4 ) declinations visible from wiyn , @xmath13 , ( 5 ) observed @xmath14-band magnitudes , ( 6 ) observed recession velocities , and ( 7 ) _",
    "t_-types ranging from sab to sd ( _ t_-types between 1.58.5 ) .",
    "we elected not to observe sa galaxies because these galaxies have less h@xmath0 emission than later types ( kennicutt , edgar & hodge 1989 ) .",
    "of the 1300 targets which met these raw selection criteria , 753 were observable during our longest wiyn densepak runs ( january and december 1999 ; @xmath15 ) .    to 5.2 in    ' '' ''    we obtained second generation digitized sky survey ( dss2 ) images to further refine our sample selection .",
    "after visual inspection , we eliminated from our sample galaxies with bars , rings , interacting companions , or foreground stars that contaminated the inner isophotes .",
    "this step removed 60% of the sample from consideration .",
    "we measured scale lengths , position angles and axis ratios from the dss2 images using the _ iraf _ _ ellipse _ routine , and we further required ( 1 ) a relatively constant position angle in the outer portions of the disk , therein removing most warped galaxies , and ( 2 ) our measurements of @xmath16 on dss2 images at three scale lengths . between @xmath17",
    "only 70 targets remained .",
    "as a test of the completeness of our selection criteria , we examined the dss2 images of every pgc galaxy in a 1 hour slice of right ascension and ascertained that our selection criteria successfully yielded every galaxy with a photometric inclination less than 30@xmath4 in this slice of right ascension .",
    "through the course of our observations , we observed 32 of these 70 targets , plus 7 other galaxies chosen from the same parent sample of 1300 targets , but which lie between @xmath18 .",
    "the 39 observed galaxies are not representative of the parent sample , rather we attempted to span a large range of morphological types and luminosity ( table 1 and figure 3 ) .",

    "galaxies with dss2 scale lengths less than six arcseconds only required one densepak position to cover several scale lengths .",
    "however , to improve fits to the velocity field we required that two spatial resolution elements ( fibers ) be used to sample one disk scale length . for galaxies with scale lengths less than six arcseconds , two overlapping densepak positions offset by a half - fiber diameter were used . for scale lengths between 6 `` and 9 '' ,",
    "we used two densepak positions offset to cover a 45``@xmath545 '' area , and for scale lengths between 9 `` and 12 '' , we used three densepak positions .",

    "after field flattening , this low throughput was translated into greater values for the continuum noise in these fibers .",
    "we believe this poor performance may be due to : ( 1 ) fibers 1 - 8 undergo the tightest bend near the slit end of densepak of all the fibers .",
    "bershady ( 2004 ) present evidence that this tight bend radius increases the focal ratio degradation of fibers for a similar integral field unit , sparsepak , thereby leading to greater losses in the spectrograph ; ( 2 ) fibers 1 - 8 are at the top end of the densepak slit .",
    "if the slit is not centered within the baffles at the spectrograph entrance , these fibers could suffer from further vignetting ; ( 3 ) alternatively , these fibers may be otherwise over - stressed , e.g. because these fibers are on an outer face of the array ( see bershady 2004 ) .",

    "this is preferable to removing cosmic rays after spectral extraction which averages cosmic rays falling in pixels that are part of extracted apertures with good data from other pixels in same spectral channel .",
    "following cosmic - ray cleaning , basic spectral extraction , flattening , wavelength calibration and sky subtraction were done using _ iraf _",
    "_ dohydra_. extracted one - dimensional spectra were field - flattened with dome flats and wavelength - calibrated using thar emission spectra . finally , the four sky spectra were averaged and the mean sky spectrum was subtracted from the other 86 spectra .",

    "our algorithm measured gaussian fluxes , widths , centers and centroid errors for lines in a given spectral interval .",
    "most emission - lines in our data were symmetric and were well - fit by a single gaussian .",
    "some h@xmath0 profiles sampled by fibers within a fiber radius of the galaxy center were skewed or even bimodal as would be expected when the fiber diameter is larger than the local dynamical scale .",
    "since the fraction of such lines was small , we flagged these lines during visual inspection after running our automated line fitting algorithm and do not cite the fit results later . while beauvais & bothun ( 1999 ) found the best fits to a variety of different simulated line - profiles were obtained with vogt profiles ( a combination of gaussian and lorentzian profiles ) , they noted that gaussian fits yielded comparable results for signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios greater than 20 .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by courteau ( 1997 ) who measured intensity - weighted centroids .",
    "our typical h@xmath0 lines had high s / n , and a visual inspection of the fits made it clear that gaussian profiles were sufficient to describe most emission lines .    since the s / n of each channel in the spectra is important for accurate profile fitting , we iteratively established measurement errors for each channel . we begin by calculating an iterative clipped mean and standard deviation within a 30   window containing the emission line .",
    "we used a very tight clipping criterion : all channels with counts greater than the standard deviation were rejected , repeating until the number of channels did not decrease further .",
    "this procedure removed almost all effects of emission - lines , imperfectly subtracted sky lines , and residual cosmic rays from the continuum mean and standard deviation .",
    "we normalized the standard deviation of the iteratively clipped data by the standard deviation of a gaussian distribution which also had been truncated at 1@xmath31 . with the continuum standard deviation , @xmath32 , established , we assumed remaining errors on channel counts were based on poisson counting errors .",
    "therefore the error on each channel , @xmath33 , was calculated as follows : @xmath34 where all counts were calculated in @xmath35/pixel , @xmath36 was the counts for channel @xmath37 , and @xmath38 was the iterative mean calculated in the 200   window .    once electron counts and the initial estimates of the standard deviations had been calculated for every channel , we used the marquardt  levinson algorithm to fit a gaussian profile plus a linearly varying background to the line within the selected region .",
    "we then subtracted this best fit spectrum within the window and recalculated the standard deviation following the same procedure described above .",
    "then we refit the data and extract the gaussian amplitude , center ( @xmath39 ) and width ( @xmath40 ) from the fit .",
    "the area beneath the curve yields the flux ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the error on the centroid ( @xmath42 ) was obtained from the covariance matrix .",

    "we found that features which had gaussian fits that did not reach the s / n threshold @xmath43 were also not identified as emission - lines by visual inspection .",
    "we also required the width of the line must be equal to or greater than the resolution element .",
    "finally , as already noted , we discarded lines that , based on visual inspection , were skewed , required multiple gaussian profiles , or formally met the s / n and width requirements but none - the - less did not look plausible .",

    "in addition to the low filling factor , h@xmath0 may exist at radii beyond the three scale lengths typically covered by the densepak observations .",
    "further , since the sample is nearly face - on , the `` turbulent '' component of the spatially - integrated line - width is critical to understand .",

    "the reasons for this gross similarity of the near - constancy with radius of different phases of the ism is outside the scope of this paper , but we do note that some radial dependence in the neutral gas is observed in some galaxies ( shostak & van der kruit 1984 ; kamphuis & sancisi 1993 ) , and variations are also seen in the ionized gas in some cases in our sample , albeit over different radial ranges .",
    "our distribution median , out of 6000 fiber samples with emission lines well characterized by a single gaussian across 39 galaxies in our sample is @xmath50@xmath51 km s@xmath1 , where the two sets of `` errors '' include 50% and 80% of the distribution .",

    "they are consistent in value and distribution for what has been observed in two other , nearby spirals ngc 3938 and ngc 5668 ( jimnez - vicente 1999 , 2000 ) , and are roughly two to three times the dispersion measured in either neutral ( van der kruit & shostak 1982 , 1984 ) or molecular gas ( combes & becquaert 1987 ) for relatively small samples of galaxies .",
    "the tightness of our sample distribution is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the largest values which skew the distribution slightly are seen primarily at the center of galaxies with steep inner rotation curves . while beam smearing appears to affect these values , the effect is small , correctable , and does not adversely influence our results here .    to 3.3 in    ' '' ''      after taking the steps as described in  4.1 of extracting the spectra and fitting gaussian line - profiles , we generated `` spatially integrated '' line - widths ",

    "we did not include spectra from fiber 1 , as they suffered from extremely low signal to noise .      to test whether the h@xmath0 linewidth profiles derived from densepak observations were valid representations of the matter and velocity distribution of the ionized gas",
    ", we constructed a linewidth profile from the narrow - band h@xmath0 image of one galaxy in our sample , pgc 38268 , for comparison .",
    "pgc 38268 was observed in narrow - band filters using the spicam camera at the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5 m telescope on april 11 , 2002 .",

    "the recession velocity of pgc 38268 shifted the h@xmath0 emission into the 6629  narrow - band filter .",
    "the h@xmath0 and 6629  filters make an ideal pair of filters for narrow - band imaging because the filters transmission curves are virtually the same in width and shape .",
    "since the night was not photometric , no attempt was made to collect flux standards .",

    "once individual data frames were fully processed , the sky background was calculated using an iteratively clipped mean and subtracted from all frames . on and",
    "off - band images were registered using 5 field stars .",
    "since the ratio of fluxes in on versus off - band for these stars were in agreement with the predicted ratio based on the filter transmission curves , we used the ratio expected from the transmission curves to scale the images and subtract frames .",
    "the h@xmath0 narrow band image of pgc 38268 with the overlay of densepak fibers in which h@xmath0 was detected is shown in the first panel of figure 7 .",
    "while densepak does not detect all the h@xmath0 flux because the the two clumps of h@xmath0 to the sw and the faint clumps to the n were not covered by the densepak array , densepak is able to detect very faint levels of h@xmath0 emission which are not visible in the image .    to 3.1 in    ' '' ''      we use this h@xmath0 narrow - band image of pgc 38268 to produce a linewidth profile . to do this , we assign a velocity to each position in the image .",
    "following the fitting procedure outlined in andersen ( 2001 ) , a best fit velocity field was determined from the densepak data .",
    "the second panel of figure 7 shows the observed velocity field from the densepak data overlaid on the narrow - band image of pgc 38268 . the best fit analytic model to this observed velocity field",
    "was then used to assign a velocity to each pixel of the narrow - band image . the resultant profile ( dashed line of figure 7 )",
    "was then smoothed by a 20 km s@xmath1 width gaussian profile ( solid line of figure 7 ) .",
    "this smoothing corresponds to the median measured h@xmath0 line - width in spectra of individual densepak fibers .",
    "when the linewidth derived from the densepak data if overlaid on this image ( dotted line of figure 7 ) , good agreement is observed between the smoothed profile and the densepak profile .",
    "w@xmath47 , the velocity width measured at 20% of the peak velocity , when measured from the profile derived from the h@xmath0 image is 152 km s@xmath1 and when measured from the profile created directly from the densepak spectra is 162 km s@xmath1 . a difference of 5 km s@xmath1 in the width of the smoothing gaussian used to smooth the line profile can account for this difference .",
    "the more striking discrepancy is between the peak flux levels in the two halves of the profile .",
    "the ratio of fluxes from the densepak data is 0.6 while the ratio is 0.5 when measured from the h@xmath0 image .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the relative positions of h@xmath0 emission and the densepak footprint : more h@xmath0 flux falls between fibers in the receding ( northern ) half of the velocity field .",
    "finally , the difference in velocity between the two peaks is slightly greater in the data from the h@xmath0 imaging .",
    "this is consistent with the non - detection of h@xmath0 at large radii and velocities in the densepak data .",
    "overall , however , we conclude the densepak - derived integrated line - width is likely an excellent approximation .",
    "we present these synthetic line - profiles for both the raw data and the summed , best - fit gaussian profiles in figure 8 , along with an overlay of the densepak observations on the @xmath24-band images .",
    "as can be seen by direct visual inspection , the line profile width and shape is very similar for the raw and gaussian summations .",
    "the smoothing of the data with the gaussion summation does not quantitatively alter low - order moments of the integrated line - profiles .",
    "for example , we find the variation of the skew , or lopsidedness , of the line profile between raw and gaussion summations is less than the observational error , and are identical in the mean .    a comparison between the   and h@xmath0 profiles are also presented in figure 8 , where the data are available . in general",
    "there is very good agreement between the widths of the  and h@xmath0 profiles .",
    "using the gaussian fits to the individual h@xmath0 spectra , we constructed a width by finding the maximum difference in centroid velocities .",
    "we compared this width to the 31  w@xmath47 measures and found a constant offset between the relations .",
    "the  line widths are 23@xmath57 km / s broader than the h@xmath0 velocity `` widths '' as defined above , roughly comparable to the @xmath218 km / s spatially - resolved line - widths of the h@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "only two of these galaxies , pgc 56010 and pgc 70962 , showed significantly larger differences in velocity widths .",
    "as noted below , only half the disk of pgc 56010 is covered with densepak pointings .",
    "similarly , we only cover the inner starbursting region of pgc 70962 , but we suspect the width of the  profile may be dominated by the especially broad emission lines observed in the h@xmath0 spectra and may not reflect the kinematics of the galaxy .",
    "further comparisons of   and h@xmath0 line - widths are in a forthcoming paper .      for galaxies with both densepak h@xmath0 and nanay  line - profiles shown in figure 8",

    ", we found that the 2.8@xmath20 densepak fibers and 3@xmath5 longer exposures enabled us to detect discrete line - emission over a much larger filling factor than apparent in the narrow - band images . despite the different detection thresholds",
    ", we used the pgc 38268 narrow - band image convolved with a model of the velocity field obtained from the densepak data to construct a spatially - integrated , h@xmath0 line - profile which accounts for all h@xmath0 gas in the galaxy .",
    "a line profile constructed using only the densepak data , despite not accounting for all the ionized gas , still was able to produce a comparable , integrated line - width .",
    "qualitatively , the two h@xmath0 emission - line - profiles exhibited the same width _ and _ asymmetry .",
    "having demonstrated that densepak observations can be used to produce a realistic line profile for pgc 38268 , we generated spatially integrated h@xmath0 line - widths for all galaxies in our sample .",
    "we have also measured the spatially - resolved velocity dispersion for ionized gas in our sample .",
    "for the 6000 ifu spectra which were well - fit by a single gaussian ( and therefore less sensitive to beam smearing ) , we remark that under the assumption that the thermal line - width for ionized gas at 10@xmath62 @xmath63 is @xmath64 km s@xmath1 ( osterbrock 1989 ) , and the intrinsic line - width is @xmath65 km s@xmath1 , then following the quadrature formalism of jimnez - vicente ( 1999 ) , the turbulent motions for  in our sample ranges from 7.7 to 24.2 km s@xmath1 ( 80% ) .",
    "this range may seem large , but is in keeping with the amplitude and range seen in fabry - perot studies of much smaller samples of galaxies ( cf .",
    "jimnez - vicente et al . 1999 ) .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , significant variations and similar amplitudes are seen in the molecular and neutral gas  albeit in small samples .",
    "for instance , combes & becquaert ( 1997 ) find 6 and 8.5 km s@xmath1 dispersions for co in ngc 628 and ngc 3938 , respectively .",
    "while van der kruit & shostak ( 1982 , 1984 ) have remarked on the constancy of  velocity dispersions in disks ranging from 7 to 10 km s@xmath1 , this is based on radio - synthesis observations of three galaxies .",
    "one of these galaxies , ngc 1058 , was re - observed by dickey ( 1990 ) at higher spectral resolution .",
    "they found a lower  velocity dispersion of 5.7 km s@xmath1 .",
    "both shostak & van der kruit ( 1984 ) and kamphuis & sancisi ( 1993 ) have also noted  velocity dispersions in two late - type , nearly face - on disk decrease from 10 - 13 km / s in the inner disk ( what kamphuis & sancisi call the `` turbulent regions of the optical disks '' ) to 6 - 8 km / s in the outer disk . while the physical mechanisms driving the velocity dispersions of the different ism phases may indeed be different ( cf . mckee & ostriker 1977 , and jog & ostriker 1988 ) , our primary points here is the variation of turbulent motions from galaxy to galaxy and within galaxies in all phases may be more significant than previously supposed .",
    "we will return to this issue in the context of the ionized gas in latter papers in this series .",
    "we gathered available , spatially - integrated  line - profiles from the literature and augmented them with new 21-cm observations from the nanay radio telescope .",
    "we have presented new  line - profiles for 23 galaxies , along with measures of their line - widths and  fluxes .",
    "these data allow us to compare line - profiles of ionized and neutral hydrogen . for galaxies with sufficient s /",
    "n in their  profiles , we found excellent agreement between the width of the profiles indicating that we are sampling the flat portion of the velocity fields in h@xmath0 for most of this sample .",
    "however , the sample of  and h@xmath0 line - profiles showed significantly different profile shapes indicating that we are observing different distributions in the ionized versus neutral gas .",
    "we have shown that integral field spectroscopy does an admirable job of obtaining integrated line - widths .",
    "line - profiles from nanay have s / n ratios far less than the s / n ratios for line - profiles constructed from densepak data . yet the nanay radio telescope has a collecting area more than 800 times greater than wiyn , and we used an average on - source integration two times longer per galaxy in   than for h@xmath0 . even if we ignore the different signal - to - noise ratios of the lines , and account for the fact that radio telescopes are roughly 100 times less expensive per m@xmath66 than optical telescopes ( of comparable steerability ; van belle 2004 ) , and that   observations can be carried out during daylight hours , the enhanced cost - effectiveness of densepak - to - nanay observations is greater than a factor of 5 . since our data was taken , nanay has undergone an extensive upgrade which has increased the sensitivity by a factor of @xmath67 , which brings the cost effectiveness roughly to unity . high signal - to - noise ratio  line profile observations using the green bank 43 m and arecibo 305 m radio telescopes have comparable cost effectiveness to our densepak observations ( e.g. haynes 1998 ; haynes 1999 ) . yet",
    "the true forte of h@xmath0 integral field spectroscopy is the high spatial resolution of resolved velocity fields and the simultaneous observations of multiple atomic species .",
    "typical radio - synthesis  maps require 10 to 20 hours of integration on westerbork or the vla , with most radio observations using beam sizes of 15 arcsec or greater .",
    "this is characteristically five times longer integrations at 5 times lower resolution than densepak .  and h@xmath0 observations probe different ions and physical scales , and so remain complementary",
    ". however , with the relatively recent advent of bi - dimensional optical spectroscopy with densepak and related ifus , it appears that efficient kinematic studies within the inner ( optically bright ) regions of galaxies are now squarely in the optical regime .",
