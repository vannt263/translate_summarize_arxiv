    "in the last few decades intense research into shock - capturing schemes has resulted in several numerical methods for solving partial differential equations ( pdes ) that admit discontinuous weak solutions in the form of shock - waves .",
    "examples of such schemes include weno ( weighted essentially non - oscillatory ) @xcite , central @xcite , muscl ( monotone upstream - centered schemes for conservation laws ) @xcite , and wave propagation schemes @xcite .",
    "one difficulty with these methods is that in general they do not trivially extend to problems in complex geometries . in order to handle application problems where complex geometry is of great importance",
    ", three broad classes of strategies have been considered : ( 1 ) cartesian cut - cell methods @xcite , ( 2 ) overlapping meshes @xcite , and ( 3 ) unstructured grid methods .",
    "we will focus in this work on the last approach , thus eliminating the problem of cut - cells ( 1st approach ) and interpolation between different grid patches ( 2nd approach ) , but requiring some efficient grid generation tool .    on unstructured grids ,",
    "the two main classes of methods that have been developed are discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) @xcite and residual distribution ( rd ) @xcite schemes .",
    "the discontinuous galerkin approach is based on defining a piecewise polynomial approximation that is continuous inside element interiors , but discontinuous across element boundaries .",
    "local 1d riemann problems are solved across element boundaries to construct the necessary numerical fluxes .",
    "residual distribution schemes can be viewed as a finite volume method where the finite volumes are defined by a grid that is dual to the original triangulation .",
    "although dg schemes have their own particular advantages , the focus of this work will be on rd schemes and , in particular , the aspect of rd schemes that separates them from all other methods : rd schemes are based on solving genuinely multi - dimensional riemann problems .",
    "this aspect allows one to obtain methods that are positivity preserving for scalar conservation laws and essentially non - oscillatory for systems .",
    "this same feature , however , presents a challenge : how can these multi - dimensional riemann problems be solved efficiently ?",
    "the standard answer to this question is the so - called systems n - scheme @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which is a generalization of roe s approximate riemann solver for 1d systems @xcite .",
    "one goal of this work is to develop an alternative to this approach .",
    "leveque and pelanti @xcite showed how several of the standard approximate riemann solvers can be interpreted as exact riemann solvers for a perturbed system of hyperbolic equations known as _",
    "relaxation systems_. their work was motivated by jin and xin s earlier paper @xcite on a class of numerical methods known as _",
    "relaxation schemes_. what leveque and pelanti essentially showed is that jin and xin s `` new '' class of methods could actually be thought of as a reinterpretation of various pre - existing approximate riemann solvers ; these results are reviewed in section [ sec : review_1d ] . after reviewing rd schemes in section [ sec : rd_schemes ] ,",
    "we focus in this work on the continuation of leveque and pelanti s reasoning and show how the n - scheme can be also be derived from a relaxation system . furthermore , using this interpretation we derive a novel genuinely multi - dimensional riemann solver that can be viewed as a multidimensional extension of the 1d local lax - friedrichs scheme @xcite . both of these results are presented in section [ sec : multid ] . finally , we compare the numerical accuracy of the n - scheme and the newly derived scheme on several examples in section [ sec : num_examples ] .",
    "what we find is that when the appropriate limiters are applied , the novel scheme has comparable accuracy to the n - scheme , although it tends to be slightly more diffusive  this result is of course consistent with well - known 1d results comparing local lax - friedrichs versus roe - type approximate riemann solvers . on the other hand , this loss of accuracy is compensated by the fact that the new scheme is less computational expensive .",
    "this gain in computational efficiency will become significant for problems involving complicated equations such as the relativistic euler or mhd equations .",
    "we briefly review in this section the results of leveque and pelanti @xcite for the case of 1d conservation laws . for simplicity",
    "we consider for the moment a scalar conservation laws of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spatial coordinate , @xmath4 is the time coordinate , @xmath5 is the conserved variable , and @xmath6 is the flux function .",
    "we assume that this conservation law is hyperbolic , meaning that @xmath7 for all @xmath8 in the solution domain .",
    "using the idea of relaxation , we will construct in this section numerical methods for approximating ( [ eqn : conslaw1d ] ) .",
    "all of these methods are in the general class of finite volume methods @xcite , which we briefly recall in this subsection .",

    "are obtained by first assuming that the approximate solution has a constant value , @xmath33 , in each grid cell , and then solving at each grid interface , @xmath34 , the initial value problem for ( [ eqn : conslaw1d ] ) with the piecewise constant initial data : @xmath35 this initial value problem is referred to as the _ riemann problem_. one of the pieces of information that can be obtained from solving the riemann problem is how much of the initial flux difference , @xmath36 , is carried to the left and how much to the right .",
    "it is precisely this information that is stored in the fluctuations , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the relaxation schemes introduced by jin and xin @xcite are based on the idea of approximating the quasilinear equation ( [ eqn : conslaw1d ] ) by a linear system with a cleverly chosen source term .",
    "the role of this source term is to force the linear system to _ relax _ in the limit as @xmath39 towards the original equation . by `` hiding '' the nonlinearity in the source term",
    ", relatively complicated quasilinear riemann problems can be replaced by simpler linear riemann problems .",

    ", leveque and pelanti @xcite showed that various classical approximate riemann solvers could be derived .",

    "380390 of leveque @xcite for a review ) , system ( [ eqn : relax_scalar_1d ] ) is first rewritten as two sub - problems : @xmath54 using this interpretation , leveque and pelanti s @xcite procedure for obtaining different approximate riemann solvers can be summarized as follows :    1 .",

    "2 .   exactly solve the riemann problem for the homogeneous linear system ( [ eqn : relax_scalar_1d_a ] ) .",
    "3 .   approximate the effect of equation ( [ eqn : relax_scalar_1d_b ] ) on the solution calculated in step ( 2 ) by directly setting @xmath55 . in other words , instantaneously relax the solution from step ( 2 ) to the @xmath43 limit",

    "note that we are allowed to take @xmath55 in the initial conditions at any arbitrary time step , since in the previous time - step we set @xmath55 in step ( 3 ) of the relaxation procedure .",

    "although this seems like an over - determined system for @xmath78 , there exists a unique solution : @xmath79 .",
    "this results in the following fluctuations : @xmath80      finally , we briefly explain how these three interpretations can be applied to a system of conservation laws of the form ( [ eqn : conslaw1d ] ) , now with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we again assume hyperbolicity , which implies that the @xmath0 matrix , @xmath53 , has @xmath1 real eigenvalues and @xmath1 linearly independent eigenvectors for all @xmath8 in the solution domain .",

    "we will describe in this section the basic residual distribution method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws in multidimensions . for further details",
    "we refer the reader to articles by abgrall @xcite and abgrall and mezine @xcite .",
    "we consider a conservation law of the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 are the spatial coordinates , @xmath106 is the time coordinate , @xmath107 is the vector of conserved variable , and @xmath108 is the flux function .",
    "we will assume that this equation is hyperbolic , meaning that the @xmath0 flux jacobian matrix , @xmath109 is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues for all @xmath110 such that @xmath111 and for all @xmath8 in the solution domain .",
    "the first step in approximately solving ( [ eqn : multid_conslaw ] ) in some domain @xmath112 is to mesh the domain with a finite number of triangles .",
    "we will refer to this triangulation as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 refers to a representative triangle radius , which in this work we just take to be the square root of the triangle area : @xmath115 .",
    "associated with this triangulation is a _ dual grid _ , which is constructed by connecting triangle centers to edge centers .",
    "a an example triangulation along with its dual grid is shown in figure [ fig : grid_dual_grid ] .    unlike the discontinuous galerkin approach @xcite , approximate solutions are centered on triangle nodes ( i.e. , centers of the dual grid ) rather than triangle centers . in order to obtain an update for these node centered values , we integrate ( [ eqn : multid_conslaw ] ) over the median dual cell @xmath116 and from @xmath20 to @xmath23 :",
    "@xmath117 next we define the median dual cell average and the time - averaged fluctuations through @xmath118 : @xmath119 using these definitions , the update formula for a generic residual distribution scheme can be written as follows : @xmath120 in the remainder of this work , we will approximate the exact solution , @xmath121 , with a piecewise constant representation , @xmath122 , that is constant on each median dual cell .",
    "we note that this view of rd schemes is slightly different than the standard view ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where the approximate solution is usually viewed to be piecewise linear on each triangle @xmath123 .",
    "although these descriptions seem contradictory , in the case for first - order accuracy in time , both interpretations yield the same numerical schemes .",
    "the advantage of viewing the solution as being piecewise constant on each medial dual cell is that this naturally sets up a series of multidimensional riemann problems in each triangle ( see figure [ fig : multid_riemann ] ) , which can be solved to construct the fluctuations @xmath124 . in this way",
    ", we can then view approximate constructions of @xmath124 as approximate riemann solvers .",
    "computing the fluctuations @xmath124 is generally done using the following framework ( again , the two interpretations , piecewise constant on each dual cell vs. piecewise linear on each primal cell , make use of the exactly the same framework ) :    1 .   on each triangle @xmath123 construct a total residual : @xmath125 where @xmath126 denotes an interpolant that passes through the three nodal values @xmath127 for example if we simply use linear interpolation , the total residual can be written as @xmath128 here @xmath129 represents the inward pointing normal vectors to the three edges of the triangle @xmath123 .",
    "the length of @xmath129 is equal to the length of the edge to which it is perpendicular .",
    "if the three nodes of triangle @xmath123 are given by @xmath130 for @xmath131 , then the three scaled normals can be written as @xmath132 2 .",
    "once this total residual has been calculated , it is then distributed to each of the nodes of the triangle : @xmath133 the detailed strategy for how this distribution is accomplished yields a specific numerical method .",
    "we first focus on design principles for scalar equations ; in a subsequent subsection we explain how to extend this to the systems case . in order to obtain a numerical update that produces a stable and accurate approximation to ( [ eqn : multid_conslaw ] )",
    ", we will need the distribution strategy to satisfy certain properties :    1 .",
    "* numerical conservation : * since the interpolation of the numerical solution is continuous across triangle edges , conservation simply reduces to the following constraint : @xmath134 in other words , in a given triangle , the sum of the distributed residuals must equal the total residual .",
    "2 .   * monotonicity preserving : * this condition makes sure that the numerical update satisfies a local maximum principle , which is needed to guarantee that the update does not generate any new spurious maxima or minima .",
    "if we write @xmath135 then the monotonicity requirement can be written as ( see @xcite ) : @xmath136 3",
    ".   * linear preserving * : the order of accuracy of update ( [ eqn : forwardeuler ] ) in the steady - state depends , among other things , on how accurately the total residual ( [ eqn : tot_res ] ) is calculated on each triangle @xcite . if we use formula ( [ eqn : tot_res_linear ] ) , then @xmath137 in the steady state , which is the correct order of accuracy if want an approximate solution , @xmath138 , that is @xmath139 accurate in the steady state .",
    "what we actually need in order to get an @xmath139 accurate steady state solution is that not only that @xmath137 , but that each distributed residual also satisfies @xmath140 .",
    "the distributed residuals can be written as @xmath141 where @xmath142 measures the fraction of the total residual that is distributed to node @xmath13 . to ensure that the distributed residuals are of the same order as the total residual , we need to make sure that the @xmath142 s remain bounded as @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath139 accuracy condition , or more commonly referred to as the linear preserving condition , can be writtten as follows ( see @xcite ) : @xmath144      modern finite volume methods for hyperbolic pdes are typically based on solving , either exactly or approximately , a riemann problem between neighboring states . for multidimensional problems , a standard approach is to solve local 1d riemann problems and then use the information from the riemann solutions to construct numerical fluxes or fluctuations ( see chapters 19 - 21 of leveque @xcite ) .    in the rd framework , however , a multidimensional riemann problem is solved . in an arbitrary triangle @xmath123",
    ", we consider the riemann problem between three constant states : @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 ( see figure [ fig : multid_riemann ] for a depiction ) .",
    "exact solutions to multidimensional riemann problems are at best expensive to evaluate , and in general not well - understood for many hyperbolic systems such as the euler equations from gas dynamics @xcite .",
    "therefore , in practice an approximate method such as the n - scheme ( the `` n '' stands for narrow ) @xcite is utilized ; this approach can be viewed as a multidimensional generalization of roe s approximate riemann solver @xcite .    just as in the 1d case",
