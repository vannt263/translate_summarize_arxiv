    "one of the most pressing issues in the study of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is the nature of the nuclear activity in seyfert  2 galaxies , which are defined by the absence of the broad permitted optical emission lines that characterize seyfert  1 galaxies and quasars .",
    "initially , the spectroscopic differences between type  1 and type  2 seyferts were thought to arise simply from differences in the location of the permitted line - emitting gas in their nuclei ( weedman 1977 ) .",
    "however , the obscuring torus model of antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) , which is based primarily on observations of the prototype seyfert  2 galaxy ngc  1068 , has provided a more sophisticated physical picture of seyfert galaxies . to account for their spectropolarimetry data , which revealed a broad - line component in the polarized flux ,",
    "antonucci & miller suggested that ngc  1068 contains a hidden seyfert  1 nucleus whose continuum source and broad - line clouds are completely blocked from view by a thick molecular torus .",
    "only a fraction of the radiation leaving the central source is thomson - scattered into our line of sight by a gas of warm electrons above the torus . by now ,",
    "about 15 seyfert  2 galaxies have had their hidden broad - line regions ( blrs ) revealed in polarized light ( miller & goodrich 1990 ; tran , miller , & kay 1992 ; kay et al .",
    "1992 ; tran 1995a , b ; young et al . 1996 ; heisler , lumsden , & bailey 1997 ) , indicating that they are really seyfert  1 galaxies for which we are located in an unfavorable viewing direction .",
    "for these objects , the orientation of the nucleus to our line of sight is principally responsible for their spectroscopic properties .",
    "the unification of the two types of seyfert galaxies in these cases is straightforward and elegant ; for this reason , it is frequently assumed to apply to _ all _ seyferts .",
    "the extrapolation of the obscuring torus model to all seyferts has been challenged on a number of occasions .",
    "for example , recent studies have indicated that the galaxian environments ( de  robertis , yee , & hayhoe 1998 ) and dust properties ( malkan , gorjian , & tam 1998 ) of seyfert  1 and seyfert  2 galaxies may differ ; if so , these are circumstances which can not be explained in terms of geometrical effects on parsec scales . similarly , moran et al .",
    "( 1992 ) reported that all known hidden seyfert  1s have nuclear radio powers at the high end of the seyfert 20  cm radio luminosity function .",
    "evidence for a hidden blr should not correlate with radio power if the orientation of the nucleus to our line of sight is the only parameter responsible for the spectroscopic classification of seyfert galaxies . using this reasoning , moran et al . suggested that there may be two types of seyfert  2 galaxies , hidden type  1 objects and `` true '' seyfert  2s , which do not emit broad emission lines .",
    "but since the known hidden seyfert  1s were not drawn from the sample of seyfert galaxies used to construct the radio luminosity function , the connection between radio luminosity and the presence of polarized broad emission lines needs to be re - investigated .",
    "even if the correlation between radio power and evidence for a hidden blr is verified , it may not provide a definitive test of the universality of the unified seyfert model . compared to the general population of seyfert  2s ,",
    "hidden seyfert  1s discovered by spectropolarimetry tend to have a lower fraction of unpolarized host galaxy starlight in their optical spectra ( kay 1994a ) , suggesting that they are more luminous objects relative to their host galaxies .",
    "if they are also more luminous seyfert nuclei in absolute terms , an apparent correlation between radio power and the existence of a hidden blr could arise from the fact that ( 1 ) the more luminous seyferts at optical wavelengths are also the brighter objects in the radio ( e.g. , edelson 1987 ; whittle 1992 ) and ( 2 ) spectropolarimetry is more effective at uncovering polarized broad emission lines in objects with lower galaxy - light fractions ( kay 1994a , b ) .    in order to address these issues in an objective manner ,",
    "we have initiated a spectropolarimetric survey of a large distance - limited sample of seyfert  2 galaxies for which complete radio information is available .",
    "observations of about half of the sample have been carried out to date . in this _ research note",
    "_ we report the discovery of a hidden broad - line region in the seyfert  2 galaxy ngc  788 , which is noteworthy because of the low radio power and the starlight - dominated optical continuum this object possesses .",
    "observations of ngc  788 ( @xmath1 ) were obtained under clear skies on 1997 september 2930 using the 3 m shane reflector at lick observatory with the lick spectropolarimeter and the red beam of the kast spectrograph .",
    "the 600  l  mm@xmath2 grating and @xmath3 reticon ccd provided a dispersion of 2.35   / pixel and a resolution of 67    ( fwhm ) over the 46007400    range .",
    "ngc  788 was observed for a total of two hours .",
    "each one - hour set consisted of four exposures with the halfwaveplate rotated to 0 , 22.5 , 45 , and 67.5 .",
    "data reduction and analysis were performed using the _ vista _ software package , and additional routines ( miller , robinson , & goodrich 1988 ) .",
    "all data were summed in the stokes parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , from which average values for polarization @xmath6 , postion angle @xmath7 , and polarized flux @xmath8 were computed .",
    "the total flux , polarization , polarization position angle , and the corresponding polarized flux of ngc  788 are displayed as a function of wavelength in figure  1 .",
    "the measured polarization has not been corrected for interstellar polarization or dilution by galaxy starlight . even though the average measured polarization @xmath6 is low0.6% at position angle 124it clearly increases across the  line to a value of 1.2% while displaying little change in position angle .",
    "most interesting , though , is the presence of a broad  component in the _ polarized _ flux spectrum .",
    "the broad  line peaks at the same wavelength as the narrow component of  in the direct - light spectrum and has an estimated velocity width of 4800 km  s@xmath2 ( fwhm ) .",
    "broad  is probably present as well , but it is difficult to see in the low @xmath9 ratio polarized flux spectrum .",
    "the narrow lines of , , and  are also visible in polarized flux , suggesting that some of the measured polarization results from transmission through a dust screen in either the milky way or the host galaxy .",
    "the nuclear radio source in ngc  788 is unresolved at @xmath10  @xmath11 resolution ( ulvestad & wilson 1989 ) , so we can not compare the polarization and radio source position angles .",
    "it is instructive to compare the radio and optical continuum properties of ngc  788 to those of the other hidden seyfert  1s discovered to date . to do so",
    ", we draw upon the survey of kay ( 1994a ) , which contains a magnitude - limited sample of 50 seyfert  2s , including ngc  788 and the ten hidden seyfert  1s studied by tran ( 1995a ) . for most of the galaxies ,",
    "kay ( 1994a ) estimated the contribution of starlight to the optical spectrum .",
    "meaurements of their core ( arcsecond scale ) nuclear radio luminosities have been culled from the literature by kay et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    the blue spectrum of ngc  788 ( kay 1990 ) and that of the dwarf elliptical galaxy m32 are displayed in figure  2 . as evidenced by the strength of various stellar absorption features , such as ca  ii  @xmath123968 , the g  band ( @xmath124302 ) , mg  i  @xmath13  @xmath125176 , and the na  i  d lines ( @xmath145890,5896 ) , it is clear that the seyfert spectrum contains a great deal of starlight and just a small amount of featureless continuum . near a wavelength of 4400   , the fraction of the continuum arising from galaxy starlight @xmath15 is @xmath10  80% ( kay 1994a ) .",
    "this fraction is rather typical for type  2 seyferts in general ( @xmath16 = 0.70 ) , but is much higher than the average value of 0.30 found for objects known to have polarized broad emission lines ( kay 1994a ) .",
    "reported for a given galaxy in different studies vary because of a number of factors , such as the amount of galaxy light falling on the spectrograph slit , the wavelength range considered in the analysis , and how closely the type and reddening of the template galaxy match those of the program object ( kay 1994a ) .",
    "although recent authors report finding higher values of @xmath15 for their small samples of seyfert  2s , ( tran 1995a ; cid  fernandes et al .",
    "1998 ) , we use measurements reported by kay ( 1994a ) since they were determined for a large number of objects ( both blr and non - blr seyfert  2s ) using a _ consistent _ procedure . ] in figure  3 we have plotted the distribution of @xmath15 for 47 seyfert  2s in the kay ( 1994a ) sample ; the ten seyfert  2s with hidden blrs studied by kay ( 1994a ) and tran ( 1995a ) ( i.e. , mrk  3 , mrk  348 , mrk  463e , mrk  477 , mrk  1210 , ngc  513 , ngc  1068 , ngc  7212 , ngc  7674 , and was  49 ) are shaded . with the exception of ngc  513",
    ", ngc  788 has a higher starlight fraction than the other hidden seyfert  1s on the plot .",
    "ngc  513 actually has a prominent broad  component in its total - flux spectrum ( tran 1995b ) , and is not , strictly speaking , a type  2 seyfert .",
    "the radio luminosity of ngc  788 would appear to distinguish it from other hidden seyfert  1 nuclei as well . with a core 20  cm radio power of @xmath17 w  hz@xmath2",
    ", ngc  788 falls at the faint end of the radio luminosity function for nearby seyferts ( ulvestad & wilson 1989 ) . as illustrated in figure  4 ( taken from kay et al .",
    "1998 ) , the other seyfert  2s known to have polarized broad emission lines are at least 30 times more luminous than ngc  788 .",
    "several authors have suggested that the infrared colors of seyfert  2s may be related to the presence of a polarized hidden blr in their nuclei ( hutchings & neff 1991 ; heisler et al .",
    "for example , heisler et al.(1997 ) have claimed that seyfert  2s with polarization evidence for a hidden blr are more likely to have `` warm '' infrared colors ( i.e. , low @xmath18 ratios ) .",
    "unfortunately , the _ iras _ satellite obtained only an upper limit for the 25  @xmath19 m flux density of ngc  788 , which does not provide a useful constraint on its infrared color .",
    "thus , we are unable to compare the infrared properties of ngc  788 to those of other seyfert  2s .",
    "ngc  788 is a weak seyfert  2 galaxy : its radio power is below average compared to other classical seyfert galaxies , and the amount of starlight in its optical continuum is above average .",
    "the detection of a polarized broad  emission line in this galaxy demonstrates that hidden seyfert  1 nuclei can be uncovered in such unremarkable objects , which provides some interesting perspective on the debate about the connection between core radio power and the presence of of a hidden blr",
    ". clearly , polarized broad emission lines are not exclusive to the most powerful seyfert  2s , contrary to the suggestion by moran et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it appears that spectropolarimetry does not necessarily bias against the detection of hidden blrs in objects with starlight - dominated continua .",
    "we can not draw more specific conclusions from just a single example ; however , we are confident that the results of our full survey , which will examine the degree to which evidence for a hidden blr correlates with isotropic properties of seyfert  2 galaxies , will provide important new insight into issue of seyfert unification .",
