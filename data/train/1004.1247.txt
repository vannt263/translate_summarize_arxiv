    "due to their proximity the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) offer an excellent opportunity to study their spatially resolved star formation ( sf ) histories . sf can be triggered by several mechanisms such as , e.g. , the self - induced gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud , tidal shocking , a turbulent interstellar medium , or cloud - cloud collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mcs and the milky way ( mw ) are interacting with each other .",
    "the formation of star clusters younger than @xmath31  gyr in the mcs was probably triggered by interactions of the galaxies with each other and with the mw ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we compared the reddenings found by isochrone fitting to the reddenings adopted from pu99 .",
    "the standard deviation is of the order of @xmath24=0.03 .    in section  [ sec : metunddistmod ] , the uncertainty in the present - day metallicity of the smc is mentioned .",
    "consequently , for some clusters , the applied isochrone metallicity of z=0.004 might not be the best choice .",
    "however , the attempt to fit the clusters with a different metallicity ( e.g. , z=0.008 ) provided fits of lower quality ( age difference of @xmath5log(age)=0.2 ) .",
    "therefore , the uncertainties of the age determinations are partly a function of interstellar extinction , partly a function of the age itself in the sense that older clusters are more difficult to identify , and partly a function of the cluster density .    an uncertainty that can not be handled with our data occurs when the clusters are all inside large groups of associations having small separations along the line of sight or when they are very sparse .",
    "sparse objects usually do not have a well - defined main sequence turn - off . on one hand , supergiants with their short lifetimes ( typically @xmath520  myr ) are well - suited as age tracers if they show a concentration toward the cluster center .",
    "we therefore require our `` best '' isochrones to reproduce the location to the supergiants in the cmds and use that as a primary criterion for age determinations . the reddenings , on the other hand , are based on the perceived locus of the blue envelope of the main sequence .",
    "the determination of cluster membership for individual stars is a difficult matter ( based on only photometric information ) and further investigation with e.g. , the hubble space telescope or studies based on spectroscopy are necessary .",

    "this phase is driven by 2-body relaxation and the morphology of the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , the disruption time of a cluster is dependent on the internal cluster conditions , such as the initial mass , density , and velocity dispersion , as well as on external conditions , such as the orbit in the galaxy and tidal heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : dissolution ] shows the age - radius relation of the combined smc and lmc cluster sample with ages between @xmath55  myr and 1  gyr .",
    "smc and lmc cluster ages are plotted against their apparent overall radii ( eq .  1 ) from the combined samples derived in this study and in c06 ( smc ) and pu00 ( lmc ) .",
    "the youngest objects in the smc have radii up to @xmath54  arcmin , but these objects are clusters adopted from c06 and are mostly classified as associations .",
    "moreover , until an age of @xmath540  myr star clusters in the mcs can still undergo infant mortality @xcite and therefore we have to treat this subsample with caution . the radii decrease until an age of @xmath525  myr and then remain relatively constant until 1  gyr .",
    "because the youngest objects in the lmc were not age - dated no extended objects can be seen at the young age end of the distribution .",
    "the cluster radii in the lmc show the same behavior as the smc clusters and are constant with time during the analyzed period .",
    "the cluster disruption time for the smc and the lmc derived in the literature is of the order of @xmath56  myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have shown @xcite that clusters with ages older than 1  gyr have a trend for larger core radii with increasing age .",
    "this trend was first found by @xcite and is also visible for lmc , fornax , and sagittarius clusters @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the radii in fig .",
    "[ fig : dissolution ] are _ apparent overall _ radii ( see section  [ sec : youngies_ages ] ) so that we can not draw any firm conclusions on possible dissolution effects based on the observed sizes alone .",
    "rz05 published luminosities of 204 smc star clusters measuring integrated colors from the mcps .",
    "b96 published integrated photometry of 624 lmc star clusters that was based on observations carried out at the ctio in chile and at the casleo in argentina . for the age - dated clusters in our samples",
    ", we computed luminosities by summing the flux of each star within the individual cluster radii ( eq .  1 ) . to correct for field stars ,",
    "the luminosity of a concentric annulus between 2 and 1  arcmin was calculated for each cluster , area corrected , and subtracted from the cluster luminosity .",
    "112 clusters of our sample are in common with rz05 s sample and 217 clusters are in common with b96 s sample .",
    "the comparison between the v band luminosity derived in our study with rz05 and b96 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vrafmevergl ] ) shows that the v band magnitudes are overall in good agreement .",
    "the lmc v band magnitudes @xmath012  mag published by b96 are systematically fainter by a small amount than the ones computed in this study . on the other hand , at the faint end the v band magnitudes ( v@xmath413.50  mag ) by b96 appear to be slightly brighter .",
    "the dispersion about the 1:1 relation ( red solid lines ) for all clusters in common is @xmath57 = 0.28 ( smc ) and 0.22 ( lmc ) .",
    "the younger the star clusters the brighter they are because young clusters still contain very massive hot stars ( e.g , supergiants ) , which contribute most of the light .",
    "the older a cluster gets the more of these massive stars are in their end stage of evolution and no longer contribute to the cluster light .",
    "therefore , clusters become fainter and redder with increasing age .",
    "this effect can be seen in the upper panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : smcraf_vager ] ( smc ) and  [ fig : lmcraf_vager ] ( lmc ) , in which cluster age is plotted versus luminosity .",
    "the red dots represent the mean of the age distribution in magnitude bins of 0.3  mag .",
    "we overplotted three galev models @xcite for the total cluster masses of @xmath58 ( blue dash - dotted line ) , @xmath59 ( blue dotted line ) , and @xmath60 ( blue solid line ) using a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "galev is a model for computing the spectral evolution of single stellar populations and galaxies .",
    "the galev models give an overview of the cluster mass range .",
    "the lower plots of figs .",
    "[ fig : smcraf_vager ] and  [ fig : lmcraf_vager ] show that star clusters of the smc and lmc become brighter with increasing radius , which is expected assuming a larger number of stars within the cluster radius , contributing to the total cluster luminosity .",
    "we have presented ages and luminosities of 324 and 1193 populous smc and lmc star clusters , respectively .",
    "an age range of @xmath59  myr to 1  gyr was covered based on isochrone fitting to resolved color - magnitude diagrams in both galaxies .",
    "using only cluster ages derived in this study , we find two maxima of enhanced cluster formation for both galaxies which appear to be correlated . in the smc ,",
    "the peaks are found at @xmath5160  myr and @xmath5630  myr , and in the lmc at @xmath5125  myr and @xmath5800  myr .",
    "model calculations predict that the last close encounter between lmc and smc occurred around 100 - 200  myr ago . during a close encounter",
    ", the star formation is expected to be enhanced .",
    "therefore , the first peaks in the cluster age distributions could have been triggered by this tidal interaction .",
    "extending our samples with cluster ages derived by c06 we find a third pronounced period of enhanced cluster formation in the smc at around 8  myr .",
    "we find the same in the lmc combining our sample with the one of pu00 .",
    "these peaks are only visible if we extend our sample with objects classified as associations , objects which did not or could not reach higher ages because they dissolve too quickly .    the youngest objects in both galaxies are associated with super giant shells , giant shells , the inter - shell region , and with hii regions . their formation is probably related to shell expansion and shell interaction . in the spatial distribution of the clusters",
    "younger than @xmath516  myr the two smc shells are clearly visible .",
    "the older objects are widely spread across the entire smc main body , but show a concentration in the western part of the galaxy . in the lmc , the youngest objects are concentrated in 30 doradus , sgs 11 ( lmc  4 ) , and in the giant shells located in the western part and in the bar region .",
    "the older lmc clusters are mostly distributed along the bar and along the rim .",
    "one can see nicely how star cluster formation propagated along the lmc bar .",
    "we find no indication for propagating star cluster formation in the sgss in either lmc or smc .",
    "most of the lmc star clusters are older than the dynamical ages of the sgss and therefore may have formed in shells , which already have dissolved and can not be detected at the present day .",
    "no obvious dissolution effects were found for mcs star clusters younger than @xmath51  gyr .",
    "it is quite difficult to ascertain a real absence of cluster dissolution using this study .",
    "two biases may play a major role : 1 .",
    "infant mortality can not be accounted for , because very young star clusters and ob - associations are not included in our sample ; and 2 .",
    "cluster dissolution processes for clusters older than @xmath51  gyr , because we did not age - date clusters in this age range . within the time period considered here - 10  myr to 1",
    "gyr - we do not find evidence for cluster dissolution .    in both galaxies ,",
    "the clusters become fainter with increasing age .",
    "the very massive hot stars , which are still present in the young star clusters and contribute most of the light , become fainter and redder with increasing age and so do the star clusters . this trend can be seen in both the lmc and the smc . the total cluster luminosity increases with increasing radius due to a larger number of stars within the cluster radius .",
