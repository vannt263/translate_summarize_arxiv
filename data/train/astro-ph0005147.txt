    "the disentangling of the starburst and agn component in extragalactic objects and determination of the properties of the interstellar medium and star formation in the host galaxies of quasars and qsos is are key problems in the investigation of evolutionary sequences and environments of agns ( e.g. genzel et al .",
    "1998 , sanders & mirabel 1996 , norman and scoville 1988 , sanders et al .",
    "1988 , rieke , lebofsky , and walker 1988 ) . at a redshift of z = 0.0611 ( condon , hutchings , gower 1985 )",
    "i  zw  1 is the closest qso for which detailed studies of the host galaxy ism are possible .",
    "all evolutionary sequences involve star formation and an abundant supply of material to fuel the starburst and the agn . in order to test these sequences",
    "it is therefore imperative to investigate the physical properties of the molecular gas phase in these objects .",
    "for a detailed study of the cold molecular interstellar medium , the fluxes and ratios of the isotopic co j=2 - 1 and j=1 - 0 lines are of interest .",
    "+   + * general properties of i  zw  1 : * the optical nucleus of i  zw  1 is bright with respect to the disk ( m@xmath2=@xmath323.45 ; schmidt and green 1983 ) .",
    "this source displays a number of properties found in high redshift qsos ( e.g. buson and ulrich 1990 , phillips 1978 ) .",
    "i  zw  1 is interacting with a nearby companion east of the nuclear bulge ( fig.[fig1 ] ) and at the edge of its optical disk .",
    "the object to the north is most likely a foreground star ( sargent 1970 ; stockton et al .",
    "1982 ; eckart et al .",
    "i  zw  1 has a 60@xmath4m/100@xmath4 m flux density ratio of 0.9 , which is indicative of an even more intense heating source of uv - visible flux than is found in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 ( young and sanders 1986 ) .",
    "our * nir imaging spectroscopy * shows that the nuclear @xmath5 band spectrum is dominated by pa@xmath6 and br@xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 band spectrum clearly shows the @xmath1co(6 - 3 ) band head at 1.619@xmath4 m indicating that about 20% of the @xmath8 band continuum is stellar . applying a starburst model shows that about 5% of the dereddened br@xmath7 line flux is stellar as well , and that the stellar nucleus of the qso i  zw  1 shows evidence of a strong decaying starburst . + * @xmath1co line emission : * combining the stellar mass derived from the starburst model , the dynamical mass from the co - rotation curve and the estimated molecular mass from the co intensity we find that within a factor of two the i@xmath9/n@xmath10 conversion factor equals the standard value of 2@xmath1110@xmath12 @xmath13k@xmath14km@xmath14s .",
    "the dynamical mass and total molecular gas mass are 3.1@xmath1110@xmath15 m@xmath16 and 5.5@xmath1110@xmath17 m@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "+ as is typical for spiral galaxies , i  zw  1 exhibits a prominent `` double horned '' @xmath1co and hi line profile ( barvainis , alloin and antonucci 1989 , condon , hutchings & gower 1985 ) .",
    "using recent observations of the @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) line from the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) schinnerer , eckart & tacconi ( 1998 ; set98 ) were able to detect molecular gas in the spiral arms of a qso host galaxy for the first time .",
    "the 5  resolution co - map ( fig.[fig1 ] ) contains the entire single dish @xmath1co line flux . at 2 `` resolution",
    "these interferometric data allowed us to resolved and separate the 3 '' to 4 \" diameter nuclear molecular gas component from the molecular disk .",
    "the nucleus contains about 2/3 of the total @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) line emission .",
    "+ set98 have calculated model position versus velocity diagrams to improve our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the nucleus and the disk of i  zw  1 .",
    "the model projects a given galaxy flux geometry onto a sky grid taking account of inclination and tilt . to this flux geometry",
    ", a rotation curve is applied . the beam size and velocity resolution of the observation",
    "are then used to calculate the model p - v diagram . to model the molecular gas emission in i  zw  1",
    "set98 assumed a two component gaussian flux distribution .",
    "one gaussian has a fwhm of 10  centered at a radius of 4  and the other a fwhm of 1.65  centered at a radius of 0.8  .",
    "the ratio between the two gaussian flux peaks is 50 , with the inner one being brighter .",
    "this model flux distribution is plotted in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the azimuthally symmetric modeled p - v diagrams match the measured ones very well .",
    "the most recent observations of the @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) line emission of i  zw  1 using the pdbi in its b / c configuration have reached subarcsecond angular resolution ( 0.9  fwhm ; schinnerer , eckart , tacconi in prep . ) . in fig.[fig3 ] we compare the @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) line emission p - v diagrams of the nucleus .",
    "the lack of j=1 - 0 line emission towards the centre reflects the ring - like distribution of the molecular gas shown in fig.[fig2 ] . compared to the j=1 - 0 line , the j=2 - 1 emission is more centrally peaked",
    "this is consistent with the finding of eckart et al .",
    "( 1994 ) that the molecular gas in the disk of i  zw  1 is cold or sub - thermally excited ( low line ratio i[@xmath1co(2 - 1)]/i[@xmath1co(1 - 0)]@xmath00.5 ) , whereas the emission from the nucleus is due to warm optically thick molecular gas ( larger line ratio i[@xmath1co(2 - 1)]/i[@xmath1co(1 - 0)]@xmath01.0 ) heated by the nuclear star formation activity .",
    "the increase of the @xmath1co(2 - 1 ) line intensity due to molecular excitation , compensates the contrast that is required to get a sharper view of the ring - like structure seen in the @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) line emission .",
    "subarcsecond interferometric @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) data taken with bima are currently being analyzed to resolve this question ( staguhn , schinnerer , eckart in prep . ) .",
