    "a major cornerstone for extragalactic astronomy is the advent of adaptive optics ( ao ) assisted imaging and spectroscopy on large ground - based telescopes like the very large telescope ( vlt ) , offering a combination of ( near ) diffraction - limited resolving power and large light - collecting area of 8 - 10 m class telescopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition 3d spectroscopy allows to study both , the morphology and the chemical composition , as well as the dynamics of extragalactic objects at the same time , at an unprecedented depth .      despite the finding of an apparent coevolution of super massive black holes in the centers of galaxies and their galaxy bulges ( hosts ) ( e.g. *",
    "* ) the detailed nature of this interconnection remains mysterious .",
    "is star formation triggered by the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) due to radiation pressure and winds from the accretion disk , which disturb the interstellar medium ( as discussed by @xcite for 3c  285 ) ? or can a nuclear starburst component initiate the accretion process onto the black hole @xcite ? recently , in their classification study of iras selected rosat sources , @xcite discovered a class of starburst / seyfert composite galaxies .",
    "they show optical spectra which are dominated by features of starburst galaxies , using the line diagnostics of @xcite .",
    "their x - ray luminosity , however , is typical for seyfert 2 galaxies",
    ". a closer look at the spectra reveals some seyfert - like features , e.g. [ oiii]@xmath3 is significantly broader than all the narrow emission lines in the optical spectrum and in some cases there is a weak broad h@xmath4 component",
    ". there appears a resemblance with narrow - line x - ray galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which also show spectra of composite nature .",
    "it is still not clear how their strong x - ray emission can be reconciled with the weak / absent optical seyfert characteristics .",
    "the faintness of these objects in the x - ray as well as the optical domain did not allow to study them in detail so far .",
    "near infrared ( nir ) studies , especially integral field spectroscopy , provide powerful means to investigate the ( circum- ) nuclear properties of the above described agn .",
    "besides the much lower dust extinction there are a number of nir diagnostic lines ( in emission as well as in absorption ) to probe the excitation mechanisms and stellar populations in these objects . among these are hydrogen recombination lines , rotational / vibrational transitions of h@xmath5 , stellar features like the co(2 - 0 ) and co(6 - 3 ) absorption band heads and forbidden lines like [ feii ] and [ sivi ] @xcite .",
    "multi wavelength sky surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) are very comprehensive databases to search in for targets suitable for very sensitive and high - resolution ao - assisted observations in the nir .    in particular , a cross - correlation between the first data release of the sdss @xcite and the rass @xcite resulted in a sample of about 70 x - ray luminous agn ( @xmath6  erg  s@xmath7 ) at redshifts between @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "most optical counterparts of the x - ray sources turn out to be agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , these x - ray luminous sources can not be studied locally because of their small number density in the local universe @xcite .",
    "they are therefore ideal targets for adaptive optics observations . a subset of this sample is comprised of the composite galaxies described in section [ sect : composite ] .",
    "our sample allows to study their optical / near - infrared properties in the above described framework . in the following",

    "fig : mrk609_hst ] ) as one of the closest and brightest ( ao self referencing ) objects for one of the science verification phase observations of the new ao - assisted integral field spectrometer sinfoni at the very large telescope @xcite .",
    "the observations presented in this contribution were taken in ao - mode with a 100  mas pixel scale and a field of view of 3@xmath103 arcsec@xmath11 .",
    "the 2-dimensional image was sliced by small mirrors into 32 slitlets which then were reimaged onto one long pseudoslit and dispersed onto a 2k@xmath102k detector . using the filters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , a spectral resolution of @xmath14",
    "was achieved .",

    "the shape of the contours , which appear to be elongated towards the root points of the spiral arms ( fig .",

    "reddening towards the nucleus due to the presence of dust is typically found in agn @xcite .",

    "* stellar absorption features like the nai  @xmath20 doublet , cai  @xmath21 , co(6 - 3 ) , and co(2 - 0 ) are visible , helping to estimate the stellar content .",
    "the great advantage of integral field spectroscopy is the simultaneous availability of spatial and spectral information .",

    "the morphology roughly follows the continuum contours of fig .",
    "[ fig : hk_median ] .",
    "thus , we could be dealing with a starburst ring embedded in a nuclear bar .",
    "there is a plentiful number of examples of starburst rings in galaxies with and without nuclear activity ( cf .",

    "high energetic nuclear emission is primarily able to penetrate deeply into the interstellar medium and produce regions which are partly ionized and where such transitions can be excited .",
    "the [ feii ] emission is slightly extended , indicating also a connection with supernovae excited emission in the starburst ring .",
    "rotational / vibrational transitions of h@xmath5 can be used to study the dominant excitation mechanisms in the circum - nuclear environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the emission lines originate in surfaces of molecular clouds exposed to stellar or nuclear radiation .",
    "three major processes are considered : ( 1 ) excitation by x - ray or cosmic rays coming from the agn ; ( 2 ) shock excitation either from supernova winds or streaming motion ; or ( 3 ) uv fluorescence from young stars .",
    "the first two processes are of thermal nature , whereas the third is non thermal . 1 - 0s(1 ) and the other detectable emission lines are also concentrated on the nucleus .",
    "line ratios are used to estimate the level populations of h@xmath5 in mrk  609 , indicating a thermal origin of the emission with a temperature of about 1900  k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h2_temp ] , zuther et al . in prep . ) . at the current stage of analysis ,",
    "excitation due to x - rays also seems to be unimportant , because a number of other h@xmath5 transitions which would be expected in the case of x - ray excitation @xcite , are not detected .",
    "this was already suggested by previous studies of a number of infrared galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "level population diagram.,width=340 ]    line ratios of hydrogen recombination lines ( e.g. pa@xmath4 and br@xmath22 ) can be used to estimate the amount extinction . assuming case - b recombination we find no significant extinction in the ring like structure .",
    "the nuclear ratios also give no significant extinction . at the nucleus",
    ", however , this value can be influenced by not - perfect separation of the narrow and broad component of the pa@xmath4 line .",
    "one can further use parts of the spectrum without prominent emission / absorption lines to generate a reddening map .",
    "[ fig : reddening ] shows the circum - nuclear reddening using parts of the continuum in the @xmath23- and the @xmath24-band .",
    "the largest values of reddening are found close to / at the nucleus and at the local pa@xmath4 peaks at the tips of the bar within the putative starburst ring .",
