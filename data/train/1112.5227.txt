    "the investigation of the semileptonic @xmath7 processes is an important source for the determination of the parameters of the standard model , such as cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath8 .",
    "they also provide valuable insight in quark dynamics in the nonperturbative domain of qcd .",
    "so a considerable amount of work has been carried out in the semileptonic decays of ground - state @xmath9 and @xmath1 mesons both experimentally and theoretically during the last two decades @xcite . with the running energies of the colliders enhanced and the precision of the detectors improved , more and more excited @xmath10 mesons",
    "have been observed . in 2008 , two orbitally excited narrow @xmath10 mesons , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , were observed by the cdf and d0 collaborations@xcite .",
    "this has inspired a lot of interest in their various decay modes@xcite , among which the semileptonic decay modes are under our consideration .",
    "the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite has been proved to be an useful theoretical tool to describe the spectroscopy and matrix elements of mesons containing a heavy quark . in the heavy quark @xmath11 limit , the spin and parity of the heavy quark decouple from those of the light part .",
    "so the heavy - light mesons can be categorized according to the total angular momentum of the light degree of freedom @xmath12 . combining @xmath12 with the spin of the heavy quark yields a doublet of heavy - light meson states @xmath13 . for @xmath14-wave ground states with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , two states of negative parity form the @xmath17 doublet @xmath18 . for @xmath0-wave excited states with @xmath15 or @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , four states of positive parity form the @xmath14 doublet @xmath21 and the @xmath22 doublet @xmath23 .",
    "the four @xmath0-wave states of @xmath10 system are usually denoted as @xmath2 and the newly observed @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons are considered as members of the @xmath22 doublet .",
    "the qcd sum rule method @xcite has been proved to be a successful nonperturbative approach which was widely used to investigate the properties of various types of hadrons @xcite . in our previous papers , we have employed it to investigate the semileptonic decays of ground - state @xmath9 mesons into some highly excited charmed meson doublets in the framework of hqet @xcite , and then extended the discussion to the case of the semileptonic decays of @xmath14 and @xmath22 doublets of @xmath10 system into @xmath17 and @xmath14 doublets of the @xmath24 system @xcite .",
    "we find that the semileptonic decay widths of a doublet of @xmath10 system into the same doublet in the @xmath24 system are significantly enhanced rather than those of its transitions into a different doublet .",
    "so it is reasonable to expect that the semileptonic decay widths of ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) into ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) should be comparable with the previous decay modes . in order to verify this point",
    ", we investigate these semileptonic processes in this paper . as a byproduct",
    ", we also investigate the semileptonic decays of the other @xmath2 doublet into the same final states .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "the decay rates and branching ratios are also estimated in the final section .",
    "the semileptonic decay rate of a @xmath1 meson transition into a @xmath25 meson is determined by the corresponding matrix elements of the weak vector and axial - vector currents ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) between them .",
    "these hadronic matrix elements can be parametrized in terms of form factors . in hqet ,",
    "the classification of these form factors has been simplified greatly .",
    "for the transitions between the @xmath14 doublet of the @xmath10 mesons and the @xmath22 doublet of @xmath24 mesons , the weak matrix elements can be parametrized in terms of one isgur - wise function at the leading order of the heavy quark expansion .",
    "but for the transitions between ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , we need two isgur - wise functions to parameterize the corresponding hadronic matrix elements at the leading order of the heavy quark expansion .",

    "in fact , the two - body strong decay widths of @xmath123 and @xmath124 are computed to be @xmath148 and @xmath149 in ref .",
    "the masses of @xmath125 and @xmath126 are considered to lie below the thresholds of @xmath150 and @xmath151 , so their main decay modes are isospin violating decays and radiative decays and are supposed to have width of about @xmath152 kev @xcite . using these widths",
    ", we estimate the orders of the branching ratios of the semileptonic decays ( see table [ table2 ] ) . note that the semileptonic decay branching ratios of @xmath125 and @xmath126 should be 3 orders of magnitude lower if their masses lie above the thresholds of @xmath150 and @xmath151 . as we can see from table [ table2 ] , the semileptonic decay widths of ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) into ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) are significantly larger than those of ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) into ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) , as was expected . the present precision of the experimental measurement of the branching ratio of the @xmath1 mesons has reached up to @xmath153 @xcite",
    ". therefore , all the branching ratios of these processes are so small that it is difficult to find them in experiments .",
    "however , we can still expect that with the precision of the detector improved , the decays @xmath154 might be seen in the lhcb experiment .    in summary",
    ", we have performed a study of the semileptonic decays of the orbitally @xmath0-wave excited @xmath1 meson states @xmath2 , including the newly observed @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons into the @xmath22 doublet of @xmath155 mesons , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , within the framework of hqet .",
    "we employ qcd sum rules to estimate the leading - order universal form factors describing these weak transitions .",
    "different from the semileptonic processes of lower heavy - light meson states , two universal isgur - wise functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are need to parameterize the hadronic matrix elements in the weak transitions @xmath156 at the leading order of the heavy quark expansion .",
    "the predicted branching ratios of these processes are prohibitively tiny , so it is difficult to find them in experiments .",
    "the decay widths of @xmath154 are comparatively large so that we expect they might be seen in the future lhcb experiment .",
    "it is worth noting that the isgur - wise functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 which parameterize the hadronic matrix elements of the weak currents between the states in the @xmath22 doublet of @xmath10 system and those in the same doublet of @xmath24 system approximately satisfy the normalization condition , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , which is implied by the heavy quark flavor symmetry at the leading order of the heavy quark expansion .",
