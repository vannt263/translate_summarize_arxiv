    "the kondo effect is an antiferromagnetic screening of a localized magnetic moment by the host metallic electrons below a characteristic kondo temperature @xmath1 , which results in the appearance of an additional peak in the system s density of states pinned to the fermi energy .",
    "being first observed during studies of transport properties of bulk diluted magnetic alloys @xcite , the kondo effect was later on shown to affect the conductance of single quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite , arrays of qds @xcite and possibly quantum point contacts @xcite . in the emerging field of spintronics @xcite",
    ", the coupling of a single qd to ferromagnetic leads can shed more light on fundamental aspects of the kondo physics and provide a basis for a design of novel spintronic composants @xcite .",
    "the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) is widely used for investigation of the kondo effect at surfaces of normal metals with adsorbed magnetic impurities ( kondo adatoms ) @xcite .",
    "the possible examples are individual co atoms at au(111 ) , cu(100 ) or cu(111 ) surfaces @xcite , and cobalt carbonyl co(co)@xmath2 complexes or manganese phthalocyanine ( mnpc ) molecules on top of pb islands @xcite .    in the present work we focus on the kondo regime for a system containing a ferromagnetic stm tip and a single kondo adatom on a metallic surface ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . in this system",
    "the conductance becomes spin dependent , due to the ferromagnetic ( fm ) tip , which leads to a zeeman splitting in the kondo adatom density of states ( dos ) .",
    "particular attention is payed to the interplay between kondo effect , quantum interference of two possible tunneling paths ( tip - adatom - host and tip - host ) and the ferromagnetism of the tip .",
    "our study differs from previous work in the same field @xcite mainly in the three aspects described below .    _",
    "first_. we present new results for the tunneling conductance as a function of the bias for different lateral tip - adatom separations r in the kondo regime .",
    "this is an actual task indeed , as in experiments with unpolarized systems , r was shown to strongly affect the conductance @xcite .",
    "for ferromagnetic tips , however , correspondent results are lacking .    _",
    "second_. we discuss the small , large and intermediate cases for the fano parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we show that the three cases above give different conductance patterns .",
    "experimentally , the large and small @xmath0 limits are relevant and have been realized for unpolarized conduction bands .",
    "for example , in reference @xcite it was shown that @xmath0 alternates from intermediate ( @xmath3 ) to small ( @xmath4 ) values by changing the cu crystal surface ( cu(100 ) and cu(111 ) ) , in which a co adatom is deposited . the conductance profile for small @xmath0 limit can also be experimentally observed in quantum corrals @xcite .",
    "alternatively , manipulating the molecular structure of the magnetic impurity on the cu(100 ) surface , it is possible to switch between the intermediate and large @xmath0 limits @xcite .    _",
    "third_. instead of using a lorentzian approximation for the kondo peak , we apply the well established doniach - sunjic formula @xcite , whose validity is supported by numerical calculations based on both numerical renormalization group @xcite , quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite and by the recent success in fitting experimental data @xcite .",
    "our results show that for a tip situated right above the kondo adatom ( _ r=0 _ ) an asymmetric zero - bias anomalies appear , which are revealed as resonances and anti - resonances in the conductance in the limits of large and small @xmath0 , respectively . for @xmath5",
    ", the conductance demonstrates a pronounced plateau in the region of small biases ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath7 leads to a suppression of the tip - induced adatom s zeeman splitting , thus resulting in a conductance pattern that resembles experimental data for unpolarized systems @xcite .",
    "finally , we verify that the kondo peak splitting strongly depends on the asymmetry between the tip - adatom and adatom - host tunnelings .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section 1",
    "we present the model adopted to describe the system under study . in section 2",
    "we derive an expression for the spin - resolved conductance based on a perturbative expansion for the tunneling hamiltonian . in section 3",
    "we discuss the numerical results .",
    "conclusions are present in section 4 .",
    "the description of the metallic host and its interaction with the adatom is performed within the framework of the single impurity anderson model @xcite with a half - filled noninteracting conduction band ,    @xmath8    where all energies are measured from the fermi level coinciding with the center of the band @xmath9 and extend from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the operator @xmath12 corresponds to a surface conduction state of the host metal with an energy - independent density of states per spin @xmath13 .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) describes a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) on the surface of a host metal .",
    "the second and the third correspond to the adatom , which is characterized by a single particle orbital energy @xmath14 and coulomb repulsion @xmath15 .",
    "the last term , proportional to @xmath16 describes the coupling between the adatom and the host metal conduction states , thus introducing the broadenings of the adatom s resonances at the energies @xmath14 and @xmath17 in the kondo regime ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , ( @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath1 the kondo temperature ) @xcite appears exactly at the fermi level .",

    "the fano factor monitors the competition between the tunneling channels in the system .",
    "it vanishes with the increase of the tip - adatom lateral distance @xmath7 , which can be modeled by an exponentially decaying function @xcite    @xmath35    the decay of the fano parameter with the increasing of the lateral tip - adatom distance was already experimentally explored in a system with a co adatom on a cu surface @xcite .    in the present work we consider a ferromagnetic tip with a spin - dependent density of states given by @xmath36,\\label{eq:8d}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 or @xmath38 for spins @xmath39 or @xmath40 , respectively , @xmath41 is a polarization degree of the tip .",
    "the inequality between spin - up and spin - down populations in the tip @xmath42 introduces an asymmetry in the splitting of the zero - bias anomaly as we will see in sec .",
    "the density of states for the unpolarized tip @xmath43 is assumed to be equal to the density of states of the host metal for simplicity .",
    "we calculate the tunneling conductance of the system treating the coupling between tip and host metal @xmath44 as a perturbation . within a second order perturbation scheme",

    "looking at equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) , one sees that the ldos depends on non - orthonormal fermionic operators @xmath50 where the spatial function @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the 0-th order bessel function .",

    "we use the expression @xmath78\\exp\\left(-2k_{f}r\\right),\\ ] ] to account for both spin and spatial dependencies of the tip - adatom coupling .",
    "for numerical analysis we adopt the following set of model parameters : @xmath79ev , @xmath80ev , @xmath81ev , @xmath82ev , @xmath83k and @xmath84@xmath85 @xcite .",
    "we consider the cases of large , small and intermediate fano ratio values .",
    "for each of these cases we analyze the dependence of the conductance on tip - adatom lateral distance @xmath7 . additionally , for large @xmath0 limit we consider how the conductance depends on the asymmetry between tip - adatom and adatom - host couplings .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit has been achieved in experiments with stm tip by employing magnetic molecules as kondo adatoms @xcite . in this limit the host metal conduction electrons tunnel towards the tip preferably via the localized magnetic adatom state . for the tip",
    "situated right above the adatom @xmath87 , the conductance reveals an asymmetric splitting of the zero bias anomaly ( figure ( [ fig2 ] ) ) , characterized by a pair of peaks at @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "such asymmetry occurs due to the spin polarization of the tip ( equation ( [ eq:8d ] ) ) , the higher peak corresponding to the majority spin up states , while the lower one to the minority spin down states .",
    "a similar asymmetric splitting of the kondo peak was recently observed in a quantum dot system coupled to two ferromagnetic ni electrodes @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit in the system we consider resembles the standard case of a single dot in between leads without lead - to - lead direct coupling ( embedded geometry ) .",
    "a wealth of theoretical works predict the spin splitting of the kondo peak in a quantum dot system coupled to two ferromagnetic leads @xcite . in those works",
    "this splitting was tuned via the relative angle between the left and the right lead magnetization @xcite , the leads polarization @xcite and an external magnetic field @xcite . here",
    "we show one alternative / additional way to tune the spin splitting , by changing the tip - adatom separation ( laterally or vertically ) @xcite .    increasing the tip - adatom lateral distance",
    ", the fano ratio decays according to equation ( [ eq:8.c ] ) and the zeeman splitting of the kondo peak quenches ( see equation ( [ eq:20.b.0 ] ) ) .",
    "these effects can be seen at figure ( [ fig2 ] ) , where the conductance is plotted for three different values of the tip - adatom lateral distance . about @xmath90 ,",
    "the two resonances merge into a single peak , thus resulting in the standard kondo resonance profile .",
    "not only the lateral tip - adatom separation can change the spin splitting , but also the vertical tip - adatom distance . to mimic this effect we change the ratio @xmath91 , thus introducing an asymmetry between the tip - adatom ( @xmath92 ) and adatom - host ( @xmath93 ) tunneling rates . when the tip becomes vertically closer to the adatom",
    ", we expect the increase of the coupling parameter @xmath92 .",
    "consequently , the splitting between the peaks becomes more apparent ( see figure ( [ fig3 ] ) ) which can be understood as consequence of the enhancement of the local tip magnetic field on the adatom due to the tip proximity .      in the small coupling limit the conductance curves ( figure ( [ fig4 ] ) ) display dips instead of peaks observed in the large coupling limit ( figures ( [ fig2])-([fig3 ] ) ) .",
    "the appearance of the dips at @xmath95 is a consequence of a destructive quantum interference between the channels tip - host and tip - adatom - host .",
    "this can be easily seen from equations ( [ eq:19])-([eq:19b ] ) for @xmath96 and @xmath97 that the ldos behaves as @xmath98 which is opposite to the case @xmath99 , where @xmath100    as in the case of large coupling , the increase of the tip - adatom distance leads to a quenching of the anti - resonance splitting as it can be seen comparing the curves corresponding to different values of @xmath7 at figure ( [ fig4 ] ) . at @xmath101 ,",
    "the asymmetric zero - bias anomaly for the dips disappears and only the standard single anti - resonance profile is recovered .",
    "a single dip structure in the conductance for small @xmath0 is verified for a system composed of co on cu(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "it is valid to note that while the large @xmath0 limit resembles the embedded geometry , the small @xmath0 limit gives similar results to the t - shaped quantum dot ( side - coupled geometry ) @xcite .",
    "the intermediate case for a normal tip is characterized by the well known fano - kondo line shape @xcite .",
    "however , the introduction of a ferromagnetic tip results in distinct fano - kondo profiles for each spin component .",
    "the spin up profile is shifted toward negative bias with an enhanced amplitude , while the spin down case moves in the opposite direction being reduced in amplitude .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset of figure ( [ fig5 ] ) , where we show @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the superposition of the spin - dependent fano - kondo profiles gives rise to the appearance of a plateau around the fermi level ( @xmath105 ) in the total conductance ( @xmath106 ) for @xmath97 ( see figure ( [ fig5 ] ) ) .",
    "for large @xmath7 ( @xmath90 ) , this plateau vanishes due to the suppression of the adatom s zeeman splitting and standard fano - kondo results for the conductance with nonmagnetic tips are recovered @xcite .",
    "we derived a spin resolved tunneling conductance for a system of a spin polarized stm tip with a single kondo adatom on the surface of a normal metallic host .",
    "the conductance dependence on the tip bias was investigated for different tip - adatom lateral distances in a wide range of the fano parameter @xmath0 , relevant for various experimental configurations .",
    "we demonstrated that the fano parameter drastically affects the conductance pattern of the system . for large values of @xmath0",
    ", we observe an asymmetric splitting of the kondo resonance which is suppressed with an increase of the tip - adatom lateral distance . for small q ,",
    "the behavior of the conductance is opposite to those observed in the large @xmath0 regime- instead of a splitted kondo peak , one observes an asymmetrically splitted kondo dip . for the intermediate case",
    "we have shown that due to the splitting of the spin resolved conductances ( @xmath107 ) , the total conductance exhibits a plateau in the region of small biases , which disappears for large enough values of a tip - adatom lateral distance .",
