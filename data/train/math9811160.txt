    "presented here is a study of stability of infinite - dimensional linear control systems which is based on the relatively recent development of the theory of evolution semigroups .",
    "these semigroups have been used in the study of exponential dichotomy of time - varying differential equations and more general hyperbolic dynamical systems ; see @xcite and the bibliographies therein .",
    "the intent of this paper is to show how the theory of evolution semigroups can be used to provide a clarifying perspective , and prove new results , on the uniform exponential stability for general linear control systems , @xmath0 ,  @xmath1 ,  @xmath2 . the operators @xmath3 are generally unbounded operators on a banach space , @xmath4 , while the operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 may act on banach spaces , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . in addressing the general settings ,",
    "difficulties arise both from the time - varying aspect and from a loss of hilbert - space properties .",
    "this presentation , however , provides some relatively simple operator - theoretic arguments for properties that extend classical theorems of autonomous systems in finite dimensions .",
    "the topics covered here include characterizing internal stability of the nominal system in terms of appropriate input - state - output operators and , subsequently , using these properties to obtain new explicit formulas for bounds on the stability radius .",
    "nonautonomous systems are generally considered , but some results apply only to autonomous ones , such as the upper bound for the stability radius ( section  3.3 ) , the formula for the norm of the input - output operator in banach spaces ( section  3.4 ) and a characterization of stability that is related to this formula ( section  4.2 ) .",
    "although practical considerations usually dictate that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are hilbert spaces ( indeed , finite dimensional ) , the banach - space setting addressed here may be motivated by the problem of determining optimal sensor ( or actuator ) location . for this",
    ", it may be natural to consider @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) @xcite ; if the natural state space @xmath4 is a banach space then , as will be shown in this paper , hilbert - space characterizations of internal stability or its robustness do not apply .",
    "we also show that even in the case of hilbert spaces @xmath7 and @xmath8 , known formulas for the stability radius involving the spaces @xmath13 and @xmath14 do not apply if the @xmath15 norm is replaced by , say , the @xmath16 norm  see the examples in subsection  [ counterex ] below .",
    "in addition to the general setting of nonautonomous systems on banach spaces , autonomous and hilbert - space systems are considered .",
    "for the autonomous case , the primary observation we make about general banach - space settings versus the classical @xmath15 and hilbert - space setting can be explained using the notion of @xmath17fourier multipliers . for this , let @xmath18 , @xmath19 , denote the transfer function and @xmath20 denote the fourier transform .",
    "the transfer function @xmath21 is said to be an _",
    "@xmath17fourier multiplier _ if the operator @xmath22 can be extended from the schwartz class of rapidly decaying @xmath7valued functions to a bounded operator from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ; see , e.g. , @xcite for the definitions . as shown in theorem [ lnormthm ] below",
    ", the norm of this operator is equal to the norm of the input - output operator .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are hilbert spaces and @xmath25 , then @xmath21 is an @xmath15fourier multiplier if and only if @xmath26 is bounded on @xmath27 ; see formula . for banach spaces and/or @xmath28",
    "this latter condition is necessary , but _ not sufficient _ for @xmath21 to be an @xmath17fourier multiplier . as a result",
    ", our formula for the norm of the input - output operator is more involved .    to motivate the methods , recall lyapunov s stability theorem which says that if @xmath29 is a bounded linear operator on @xmath4 and if the spectrum of @xmath29 is contained in the open left half of the complex plane , then the solution of the autonomous differential equation @xmath30 on @xmath4 is uniformly exponentially stable",
    "; equivalently , the spectrum @xmath31 is contained in the open unit disk @xmath32 , for @xmath33 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that when @xmath29 is a bounded operator , then the spectral mapping theorem holds : @xmath34 difficulties with lyapunov s theorem arise when the operators , @xmath29 , are allowed to be unbounded .",
    "in particular , it is well known that there exist strongly continuous semigroups @xmath35 that are _ not _ uniformly exponentially stable even though @xmath36 for all @xmath37 ; see , e.g. , @xcite . for nonautonomous equations",
    "the situation is worse .",
    "indeed , even for finite - dimensional @xmath4 it is possible for the spectra of @xmath3 to be the same for all @xmath33 _ and _ contained in the open left half - plane yet the corresponding solutions to @xmath38 are not uniformly exponentially stable ( see ( * ? ? ? *",
    "exm.7.1 ) for a classical example ) . in the development that follows we plan to show how these difficulties can be overcome by the construction of an  evolution semigroup . \"",
    "this is a family of operators defined on a superspace of functions from @xmath39 into @xmath4 , such as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , or @xmath42 .",
    "section  1 sets up the notation and provides background information . section  2 presents the basic properties of the evolution semigroups . included here is the property that the spectral mapping theorem always holds for these semigroups when they are defined on @xmath4-valued functions on the _ half - line _ , such as @xmath43 .",
    "a consequence of this is a characterization of exponential stability for nonautonomous systems in terms of the invertibility of the generator @xmath44 of the evolution semigroup .",
    "this operator , and its role in determining exponential stability , is the basis for many of the subsequent developments . in particular",
    ", the semigroup @xmath35 _ is _ uniformly exponentially stable provided @xmath45 for all @xmath46 .",
    "section  3 addresses the topic of the ( complex ) stability radius ; that is , the size of the smallest disturbance , @xmath47 , under which the perturbation , @xmath48 , of an exponentially stable system , @xmath49 , looses exponential stability .",
    "results address structured and unstructured perturbations of autonomous and nonautonomous systems in both banach and hilbert space settings .",
    "examples are given which highlight some important differences between these settings .",
    "also included in this section is a discussion about the transfer function for infinite - dimensional _ time - varying _ systems .",
    "this concept arises naturally in the context of evolution semigroups .    in section  4 the explicit relationship between internal and external stability",
    "is studied for general linear systems .",
    "this material expands on the ideas begun in @xcite .",
    "a classical result for autonomous systems in hilbert space is the fact that exponential stability of the nominal system ( internal stability ) is , under the hypotheses of stabilizability and detectability , equivalent to the boundedness of the transfer function in the right half - plane ( external stability ) .",
    "such a result does not apply to nonautonomous systems and a counterexample shows that this property fails to hold for banach space systems .",
    "properties from section  2 provide a natural banach - space extension of this result : the role of transfer function is replaced by the input - output operator .",
    "moreover , for autonomous systems we provide an explicit formula relating the norm of this input - output operator to that of the transfer function . finally , we prove two theorems  one for nonautonomous and one for autonomous systems  which characterize internal stability in terms of the various input - state - output operators .",
    "this introduction concludes with a brief synopsis of the main results .",
    "the characterization of uniform exponential stability in terms of an evolution semigroup and its generator is given in theorem [ expstabthm+ ] , theorem [ tvvann ] , and corollary [ vanncor ] .",
    "although these results are essentially known , the proofs are approached in a new way .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ tvvann ] identifies the operator @xmath50 used to determine stability throughout the paper .",
    "theorem   [ l0boundthm ] records the main observation that the input - output operator , @xmath51 , for a general nonautonomous system is related to the inverse of the generator of the evolution semigroup . a very short proof of the known fact that the stability radius for such a system is bounded from below by @xmath52 is also provided here .",
    "the upper bound for the stability radius , being given in terms of the transfer function , applies only to autonomous systems and is proven in subsection  3.3 .",
    "the upper bound , as identified here for banach spaces , seems to be new although our proof is based on the idea of the hilbert - space result of ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.5 ) . in subsection  3.3",
    "we also introduce the pointwise stability radius and dichotomy radius .",
    "estimates for the former are provided by theorems [ lms - gearhart+bdeltac ] and [ ptwisebounds ] while the latter is addressed in lemma  [ dichrad ] .",
    "examples [ rstabineqex ] and [ stephenex ] show that , for autonomous banach space systems , both inequalities for the upper and lower bounds on the stability radius ( see theorem  [ autin ] ) can be strict . in view of the possibility of the strict inequality @xmath53 , theorem [ lnormthm ]",
    "provides a new banach space formula for @xmath54 in terms of @xmath29 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . in section  4 this expression for @xmath57",
    "is used to relate state - space versus frequency - domain stability ",
    "concepts which are _ not _ equivalent for banach - space systems .",
    "a special case of this expression gives a new formula for the growth bound of a semigroup on a banach space ; see theorem  [ autonstab ] and the subsequent paragraph .",
    "finally , theorem  [ bigiostab ] extends a classical characterization of stability for stabilizable and detectable control systems as it applies to nonautonomous banach - space settings .",
    "throughout the paper , @xmath58 will denote the set of bounded linear operators between complex banach spaces @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath29 is a linear operator on @xmath4 , @xmath59 will denote the spectrum of @xmath29 , @xmath60 the resolvent set of @xmath29 relative to @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath29 is invertible in @xmath63 , @xmath64 . also , let @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath29 generates a strongly continuous ( or @xmath66 ) semigroup @xmath35 on a banach space @xmath4 the following notation will be used : @xmath67 denotes the spectral bound ; @xmath68 is the abscissa of uniform boundedness of the resolvent ; and @xmath69 denotes the growth bound of the semigroup . in general , @xmath70 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) with _ strict _ inequalities possible ; see @xcite for examples .",
    "however , when @xmath4 is a hilbert space , the following spectral mapping theorem of l.  gearhart holds ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) :    [ gearth ] if @xmath29 generates a strongly continuous semigroup @xmath71 on a hilbert space , then @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , @xmath73 if and only if @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "in particular , this result shows that on a hilbert space @xmath4 the semigroup @xmath35 is uniformly exponentially stable if and only if @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "now consider operators @xmath3 , @xmath2 , with domain @xmath77 in a banach space @xmath4 .",
    "if the abstract cauchy problem @xmath78 is well - posed in the sense that there exists an evolution ( solving ) family of operators @xmath79 on @xmath4 which gives a differentiable solution , then @xmath80 , @xmath81 in @xmath39 , is differentiable , @xmath82 is in @xmath77 for @xmath2 , and holds .",
    "the precise meaning of the term evolution family used here is as follows .",
    "defevolfam a family of bounded operators @xmath83 on @xmath4 is called an _ evolution family _ if    1 .",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 for all @xmath86 ; 2 .   for each @xmath87",

    "evolution families appear as solutions for abstract cauchy problems .",

    "3 .   in the autonomous case where @xmath97 is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup @xmath35 on @xmath4 then @xmath98 , for @xmath89",

    "the existence of a _",
    "differentiable _ solution to plays little role in this paper , so the starting point will usually not be the equation , but rather the existence of an exponentially bounded evolution family .    in the next section",

    "this is made explicit by the following corollary of remarks  [ autsmt ] : the spectral bound @xmath122 and the growth bound @xmath123 for the evolution semigroup coincide and are equal to the growth bound of @xmath71 : @xmath124    one of the difficulties related to nonautonomous problems is that their associated evolution families are two - parameter families of operators . from this point of view",
    ", it would be of interest to define a _",

    "for such a semigroup to be useful , its properties should be closely connected to the asymptotic behavior of the original nonautonomous problem .",
