    "the decay of @xmath6 charmonium states , like @xmath2 and @xmath3 , to @xmath7 is a cp violating process . however , since cp violations in both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems have been well established  @xcite , it is of interest to search for them in other possible processes .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown  @xcite that the @xmath7 system can be used to test the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox versus quantum theory .",
    "the space - like , separated coherent quantum system may yield some @xmath0 decays if epr s locality is correct while quantum theory forbids this process .",
    "mark - iii searched for decays of @xmath0 with 2.7  million @xmath2 events  @xcite .",
    "no signal was observed , and the upper limit on the decay branching ratio was determined to be @xmath10 at the 90% confidence level ( c. l. ) .",
    "the same search for @xmath3 decays has not been performed before .    in this letter , we report on a search for @xmath0 using a sample with 20 times more statistics than before , and on the first search for @xmath1 .",
    "the data samples used for the analyses are taken with the beijing spectrometer ( besii ) detector at the beijing spectrometer ( bepc ) storage ring at a center - of - mass energies corresponding to @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the data samples contain @xmath13 @xmath2 events and @xmath14 @xmath3 events , as determined from inclusive hadronic decays  @xcite .",
    "bes is a conventional solenoidal magnet detector that is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ; besii is the upgraded version of the detector  @xcite . a 12-layer vertex chamber ( vc ) surrounding the beam pipe",
    "provides trigger information .",
    "a forty - layer main drift chamber ( mdc ) , located radially outside the vc , provides trajectory and energy loss ( @xmath15 ) information for charged tracks over @xmath16 of the total solid angle .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 in @xmath19 ) , and the @xmath15 resolution for hadron tracks is @xmath20 .",
    "an array of 48 scintillation counters surrounding the mdc measures the time - of - flight ( tof ) of charged tracks with a resolution of @xmath21 ps for hadrons .",
    "radially outside the tof system is a 12 radiation length , lead - gas barrel shower counter ( bsc ) .",
    "this measures the energies of electrons and photons over @xmath22 of the total solid angle with an energy resolution of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 in gev ) .",
    "outside of the solenoidal coil , which provides a 0.4  tesla magnetic field over the tracking volume , is an iron flux return that is instrumented with three double layers of counters that identify muons of momentum greater than 0.5  gev/@xmath25 .",
    "a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation is used for the determination of mass resolutions and detection efficiencies . for the signal channels , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the angular distribution of one @xmath26 is generated with the same distribution as for the cp allowed channels @xmath27 and @xmath28 , namely as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the polar angle of the @xmath26 in the laboratory system .",
    "only @xmath31 is generated , and the @xmath26 is allowed to decay in the detector according to its lifetime . the simulation of the detector response is done using a geant3 based program with detailed consideration of the detector performance ( such as dead electronic channels ) .",
    "reasonable agreement between data and monte carlo simulation has been observed in various channels tested , including @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36 . for this study ,",
    "10,000 events for each signal channel are produced .",
    "for the decay channels of interest , the candidate events are required to satisfy the following selection criteria :    1 .",
    "the number of charged tracks is required to be four with net charge zero .",
    "each track should satisfy @xmath37 , where @xmath30 is the polar angle in the mdc , and should have a good helix fit so that the error matrix of the track fitting is available for secondary vertex finding .",
    "the tracks are assumed to be either @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "the higher momentum positive track and the lower momentum negative track are assumed to come from one of the @xmath26 decays , and the remaining two tracks are assumed to come from the other @xmath26 decay .",
    "the intersection of the track - pairs near the interaction point are determined and are regarded as the @xmath26 vertices .",
    "3 .   each @xmath26 candidate is required to have a decay length in the transverse plane ( @xmath40 ) greater than 3  mm and an invariant mass within twice the mass resolution as estimated from monte carlo simulations ( the mass resolution in @xmath2 decays is 7.1  mev/@xmath41 and in @xmath3 decays 7.9  mev/@xmath41 ) .    for @xmath3 decays , backgrounds from @xmath42 with @xmath2 decaying into two charged tracks",
    "are removed by further requiring the mass recoiling against the lower momentum positive and negative tracks , @xmath43 , to be less than 3.0  gev/@xmath41 .",
    "the comparison of the recoil mass distributions of signal and background events from monte carlo simulation is shown in figure  [ mrec ] .",
    "it can be seen that this requirement is very efficient in removing background , and the loss of efficiency is small ( @xmath44 4% ) .    another possible background is from @xmath45 @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "figure  [ pmiss ] shows @xmath7 missing momentum distributions for the signal and background channels , all simulated by monte carlo .",
    "we make an additional requirement @xmath48  gev/@xmath25 for @xmath3 selection .",
    "this removes 94% of @xmath49 background and almost all the @xmath50 background , while the efficiency for @xmath1 is about 92% according to monte carlo simulation . for @xmath2",
    "decays , since @xmath51 is forbidden by parity conservation , no requirement is applied .",
    "the momenta of the two @xmath26 tracks for events passing the above selection are plotted in figures  [ pkspksj ] and [ pkspks ] , for @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays , respectively , together with the regions predicted for signal events by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the two circles correspond to @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the momenta of the two @xmath26 candidates in the event ; @xmath55 is the @xmath26 momentum resolution , which is 28  mev/@xmath25 in @xmath2 decays and 34  mev/@xmath25 in @xmath3 decays , as determined from monte carlo simulations ; and @xmath56 is the expected @xmath26 momentum in @xmath2 ( 1.466  gev ) or @xmath3 ( 1.775  gev ) two - body decays .",
    "the inner circles correspond to @xmath57 , and the outer circles are for @xmath58 .",
    "it can be seen that there are no candidate events in either @xmath2 or @xmath3 decays within the one @xmath55 circle , and there is only one candidate in each case lying between the one and two @xmath55 circles . using the 2@xmath55 circle for our event selection",
    ", one event is obtained each for @xmath0 and for @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding efficiencies , @xmath59 , are 20.74% and 19.18% for @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays , respectively , as estimated from monte carlo samples .",
    "the backgrounds remaining in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays after the @xmath26 requirement are studied with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the main background channel in @xmath2 decays is from @xmath60 is estimated to be @xmath61 events , which is obtained using a monte carlo sample six times as large as the @xmath2 sample .",
    "the main backgrounds channels in @xmath3 decays are @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . a monte carlo simulation estimates the total background to be @xmath65 events , with about 80% due to @xmath63 .",
    "the errors on the estimated backgrounds are from the uncertainties of the branching ratios used and the limited statistics of the monte carlo samples .",
    "the two candidate events are investigated further , and it is found that the @xmath0 candidate is most likely a @xmath60 , with @xmath66 misidentified as @xmath31 because no particle identification is used in the event selection , while the @xmath1 candidate looks like a @xmath62 , @xmath63 event with an isolated photon with bsc energy of 126  mev .",
    "due to the long decay length of the high momentum @xmath26 and the requirement of hits in the vc , the trigger efficiency of @xmath7 events is lower than for normal hadronic events .",
    "since the trigger system is not included in the monte carlo simulation , the trigger efficiency is measured with data by comparing events within and beyond the outer radius of the vc using @xmath67 events , which yields trigger efficiencies of @xmath68 and @xmath69 for a single @xmath26 in @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays , respectively . for @xmath7 events ,",
    "the trigger efficiency , @xmath70 , is calculated to be @xmath71% in @xmath2 decays and @xmath72% in @xmath3 decays .",
    "the secondary vertex finding algorithm is checked using @xmath73 events .",
    "it is found that the monte carlo simulates data fairly well , and extrapolating the difference between data and monte carlo simulation to the @xmath26 momentum range under study and correcting by the polar angle dependence of the efficiency , correction factors of @xmath74 and @xmath75 are obtained for a single @xmath26 in @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays , respectively . for @xmath7 decays , the correction factors and errors to the monte carlo efficiencies , @xmath76 , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the total systematic error on the branching ratio measurement comes from all sources listed in table .",
    "the simulation of the tracking efficiency agrees with data within 1 - 2% for each charged track as measured using channels like @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and 8% is taken conservatively as the systematic error for the channel of interest .",
