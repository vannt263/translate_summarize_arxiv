    "the phenomenology of heavy flavour production has been so far a mixed success .",
    "although the order of magnitude of the total cross sections , and the shape of differential distribution is reasonably predicted , large discrepancy are present , especially for @xmath0 production .",
    "the theoretical framework for the description of heavy flavour production is the qcd improved parton model . besides the well - established nlo corrections to the inclusive production of heavy quark in hadron - hadron @xcite , hadron - photon @xcite , and photon - photon collisions",
    "@xcite , much theoretical work has been done in the resummation of contributions enhanced in certain regions of phase space : the sudakov region , the large transverse momentum region and the small-@xmath2 region .",
    "the theoretical effort involved is justified by the large variety of applications that heavy quark production physics has , in top , bottom and charm production . besides the need of modeling these processes",
    ", heavy quark production is an important benchmark for testing qcd and parton model ideas , due to the relative complexity of the production process , the large range of masses available , and the existence of different production environments , like @xmath1 annihilation , hadron , photon - hadron and photon - photon collisions .",
    "top production @xcite has been a most remarkable success of the theoretical model .",
    "the measured cross section has been found in good agreement with theoretical calculations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ topxsec ] .",
    "resummation of soft gluon effects @xcite reduces the theoretical uncertainty in the cross section , pushing it toward the high side of the theoretical band .",
    "it remains , however , inside the theoretical band of the fixed order calculation , thus showing consistency with the estimated error .",
    "recently , the hera - b experiment has measured the @xmath3 total cross section @xcite .",
    "this experiment is sensitive to the moderate transverse momentum region , where the bulk of the total cross section is concentrated . since the production is ( in a certain sense ) close to threshold , resummation of sudakov effects is useful also in this case .",
    "a comparison of the hera - b measurement with a theoretical calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ bxsec ] .",
    "the hera - b result is compatible with the central value prediction , with the @xmath0 pole mass around @xmath4 gev .",
    "higher precision may constrain further the @xmath0 quark mass .",
    "cdf has a longstanding disagreement with qcd in @xmath0 production .",
    "a very recent publication of the @xmath5 differential cross section @xcite has quantified the disagreement as a factor of @xmath6 in the ratio of the measured cross section over the theoretical prediction .",
    "this discrepancy has been present since a long time , and it has been observed both in cdf and d0 .",
    "some authors @xcite have argued that the discrepancy could be interpreted as a signal for supersimmetry .    because of the large theoretical uncertainties , this discrepancy has been often downplayed .",
    "in fact , several effects may conspire to raise the @xmath0 cross section to an appropriate value .",
    "it was early recognized that small-@xmath2 effects may be important in @xmath0 production at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "resummation of these effects @xcite leads to an increase of the cross section of the order of 30% .",
    "threshold effects are small in this case @xcite , being below 15% , but they are nevertheless positive .",
    "resummation of large @xmath7 yields an increase in the @xmath8 spectrum of the order of 20%  in the intermediate @xmath8 region @xcite .",
    "the presence of many possible enhancements should not lead , however , to excessive optimism .",
    "first of all , it is not clear whether these effect can be added up without overcounting .",
    "furthermore , they are all higher order effects , and thus should not push the cross section too far out of the theoretical band , which includes estimates of unknown higher order effects .",
    "it has been observed since some time that an improper understanding of fragmentation effects may be one of the causes of the tevatron discrepancy .",
    "this possibility stems from the fact that @xmath0 quark cross sections are in reasonable agreement with the tevatron measurements of the @xmath9 meson spectrum , while the cross section obtained by applying a standard fragmentation function of the peterson form @xcite with @xmath10 to the quark cross section yields too soft a spectrum , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ bbdiff ] .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested to study @xmath0 quark jets rather than @xmath9 meson s distributions .",
    "in fact , the jet momentum should be less sensitive to fragmentation effects than the hadron momentum .",
    "a d0 study @xcite has demonstrated that by considering @xmath0 jets instead of @xmath9 hadrons the agreement between theory and data improves considerably ( see fig .  [ bjets ] ) .",
    "if fragmentation effects are so important , they should be assessed very carefully before claiming a discrepancy with data .",
    "non - perturbative fragmentation is usually introduced by writing the hadron - level cross section for @xmath9 mesons as @xmath11 where @xmath8 is the hadron , and @xmath12 is the quark transverse momentum .",
    "traditionally , @xmath13 is given by the peterson form @xcite @xmath14 strictly speaking , this procedure is justifiable only in the limit of large transverse momenta ( i.e. @xmath15 ) .",
    "it can however be consider a rough model of the effect of fragmentation at moderate and small transverse momenta , as long as the variable @xmath16 is referred to the momentum or the kinetic energy , rather than the energy or the @xmath17 component , of the quark momentum .",
    "( [ eq : peterson ] ) is often used with @xmath10 for bottom and @xmath18 for charm , in conjunction with shower montecarlo programs .",
    "these values of @xmath19 were obtained from fits to inclusive heavy flavour production distributions in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the shower montecarlo accounts for hard fragmentation effects ( i.e. hard gluon radiation ) , where hard means from the typical transverse momentum of the process down to some cutoff , of the order of the hadron mass .",
    "this accounts for scaling violation in the inclusive cross section for the production heavy quarks collisions is sometimes also called fragmentation function , which is often a source of confusion ] .    it has become common practice to adopt the value @xmath10 also in conjunction with nlo calculations of @xmath0 production cross sections .",
    "this practice is not totally justified , since the procedure used to obtain this value of @xmath19 does not match the accuracy of the nlo calculation .",
    "a better approach is possible ; one can use nll resummation of transverse momentum logarithms in the context of @xmath1 data in order to extract an appropriate non - perturbative fragmentation function , and supplement nlo heavy flavour production calculations with nll resummation , in order to correctly account for scaling violation .",
    "the theoretical tools to do this are in fact available in the literature :    * single inclusive particle production in hadronic collisions @xcite .",
    "single hadron production are described in term of nlo single parton cross section convoluted with a nll fragmentation function ; * heavy quark fragmentation function @xcite ; a method for the computation of the heavy quark fragmentation function at all orders in perturbation theory is developed , and applied at nll .",
    "several applications in @xmath1 physics have appeared @xcite . * single inclusive heavy quark production at large @xmath20 @xcite ; item 1 and 2",
    "are combined to give a nll resummation of transverse momentum logarithms in heavy quark production ; * fonll calculation of single inclusive heavy quark production ; item 3 is merged without overcounting with standard nlo calculations . this procedure has been implemented both in hadroproduction @xcite and in photoproduction @xcite .",
    "when using these ingredients , it was found that the cdf discrepancy is considerably reduced @xcite .",
    "it can be quantified as a factor of @xmath21 .",
    "reduction in the discrepancy is due to four basic points :    * fonll calculation brings about a 20% increase in the intermediate @xmath20 region . *",
    "the fragmentation step for going from a `` perturbative '' @xmath0 quark to a @xmath9 hadron seems to be too strong at small @xmath20 in the cdf implementation .",
    "we get a 20% increase in the small @xmath20 region . *",
    "a peterson fragmentation function with @xmath22 is too soft ( present @xmath1 data favour values around @xmath23 ) ; this is a 20%  effect . * a more accurate use of @xmath1 input data on the fragmentation function , described in the following section , brings about another 20% effect .",
    "the net effect is @xmath24 and @xmath25 , so that the 2.9 cdf discrepancy becomes our @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath13 is extracted from fits to @xmath1 data .",
    "one has @xmath27 from the above equation it is easy to show that @xmath28 where @xmath29 it turns out that for the computation of the hadronic cross sections , only the first few moments of the fragmentation function are important .",
    "this follows from the fact that the heavy quark hadroproduction cross section is a steeply falling function of the transverse momentum , following roughly a power law . assuming the form @xmath30 one finds @xmath31 this simple fact was noticed long ago @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath32 ranges from 3 to 5 in hadronic collisions . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that eq .",
    "( [ sigapprox ] ) is also an excellent approximation to the exact convolution .",
    "when fitting the non - perturbative fragmentation function from @xmath1 data , the low moments relevant for hadroproduction are not well fitted .",
    "the peterson form with @xmath33 gives a good fit to the shape of the inclusive cross section , but not to the moments .",
    "for the purpose of predicting hadronic cross section it is instead better to make sure that the first few moments are accurately fitted . in fig .",
    "[ cfrkart ] , it is shown that a fit to the second moment alone with the simple form @xmath34 , yields a good fit to all moments in the interesting region ( i.e. between 3 and 5 ) .",
    "we also notice that the second moment fit ( @xmath35 fit from now on ) , the @xmath33 and the @xmath10 fits differ by 20% around the @xmath36 moment .",
    "the reason why @xmath2 fits do not yield good fits to moments is easy to explain .",
    "the large @xmath2 region in the inclusive production of heavy flavoured hadrons in @xmath1 annihilation is a very difficult region to model .",
    "it is in fact affected by large perturbative ( i.e. sudakov ) and non - perturbative effects .",
    "it is unlikely that the simple forms used commonly for the non - perturbative fragmentation function can accurately model these complex effects .",
    "thus , the large @xmath2 region is usually excluded from the fits . on the other hand",
    ", this region is the most important one for moments .    from fig .",
    "[ cfrkart ] , another important fact becomes apparent . when using nll calculations for the perturbative part of the fragmentation function , the importance of the non - perturbative effects on moments is greatly reduced .",
    "this can be taken as an indication of the fact that the heavy quark fragmentation function is , to a considerable extent , perturbatively calculable .",
    "the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite may affect other @xmath0 production data at hadron colliders . here",
    "i consider , as an example , the inclusive muon cross section in the central and forward region , where the muons come from the semileptonic decays of the @xmath0 flavoured hadrons .",
    "these distributions were measured by the d0@xcite experiment , and found to be higher than theoretical prediction by up to a factor of 4 in the forward region .",
    "the result of the calculation performed with the method of ref .",
    "@xcite is reported in fig .",
    "[ d0-fmu ] .",
    "as one can see , the agreement with data is now quite remarkable .",
    "the theory of heavy flavour production seems to give a good qualitative description of the available data . in the case of top production ,",
    "the comparison between theory and experiment is satisfactory also at a quantitative level .",
    "recent progress has taken place in the field of @xmath0 hadroproduction .",
    "the hera - b experiment has provided a cross section for @xmath0 production at relatively low cm energy .",
