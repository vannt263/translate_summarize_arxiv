    "an effective average action has been built @xcite , and such a nongaussian ultraviolet fixed point has been found in the case of the einstein  hilbert and higher - derivative truncations @xcite .",

    "for example , in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) it has been argued that the resulting scale dependence of the newton parameter at large distances might mimic the presence of dark matter at galactic and cosmological scales . on the other hand , in early work by some of us @xcite ,",
    "we had tried to build an action functional where the running of the newton parameter is ruled by suitable euler  lagrange or hamilton equations , while being compatible with the renormalization - group flow in the neighbourhood of an ultraviolet fixed point . for this purpose ,",

    "@xcite focused on cosmological models with friedmann  lemaitre  robertson  walker symmetry , but of course other symmetries are also relevant in the investigation of the early universe . in particular , we are here concerned with the requirement of spherical symmetry , for which a thorough hamiltonian analysis in general relativity was performed , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that case , the starting point is of course the schwarzschild line element written in the curvature coordinates @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 where , in @xmath8 units , @xmath9 .",

    "in other words , it is possible to generalize the standard adm lagrangian and regard @xmath0 as a dynamical field obeying and euler  lagrange equation , the underlying idea being that all fields occurring in the lagrangian @xmath19 should be ruled by @xmath19 in the first place .",

    "non - vanishing values of @xmath18 in ( 2.1 ) ( cf @xcite ) ensure that no primary constraint of vanishing conjugate momentum to @xmath0 arises .",
    "its preservation in time ( which is necessary because @xmath0 is here a dynamical variable , on the same ground of the space - time metric ) would lead , following the dirac method @xcite , to further constraints with considerable technical complications .",
    "such an action is sufficient for the purposes of an adm analysis , which is what we do hereafter , but its generalization to a form invariant under diffeomorphisms in @xmath21 space - time dimensions remains an open problem .",
    "we should also stress that ( 2.1 ) is not just a brans  dicke action in the jordan frame @xcite , subject to the identification of @xmath22 with a scalar field @xmath23 , because ( 2.1 ) , as we said above , results from the definition @xcite @xmath24 \\sqrt{-g}d^{4}x + { 1\\over 8\\pi}\\int_{m}{1\\over \\sqrt{-g}g }   \\bigr[(k \\sqrt{h})_{,0 } -f_{\\ ; , i}^{i}\\bigr]\\sqrt{-g}d^{4}x , \\label{(2.2)}\\ ] ] where @xcite @xmath25 in the formula ( 2.2 ) , the last two terms in the integrand are not total derivatives since @xmath0 is variable , and hence the euler  lagrange equations resulting from ( 2.2 ) differ from the brans  dicke field equations .    on relying upon the work in ref .",

    "this is clearly proved in the hamiltonian framework advocated in our paper .",
    "suppose in fact that @xmath1 were an independent dynamical variable .",
    "the primary constraint of vanishing momentum conjugate to @xmath1 would then be preserved in time , from ( 2.1 ) , provided that either the lapse function or the determinant of the induced three - metric vanishes , leading therefore to a complete ` collapse ' of the adm geometry .",
    "we now also assume that the departure from general relativity is not so severe , so that the @xmath20 function keeps its functional dependence on @xmath100 , at least approximately .",
    "more precisely , since @xmath20 should reduce to ( 2.40 ) in the case of constant @xmath0 , it can only differ from ( 2.40 ) by terms involving explicitly the gradient of @xmath0 .",
    "a good ` a posteriori ' check of any approximate solution for @xmath0 is therefore whether it has a gradient with negligible effects .",
    "we thus insert into eq .",
    "( 2.44 ) the form ( 2.40 ) of the @xmath101 function , with @xmath0 taken to depend on @xmath2 only , and we obtain eventually the nonlinear differential equation @xmath102 where ( hereafter , @xmath103 is the newton parameter on solar system scale ) @xmath104 @xmath105 and we have restored the physical units , since we want to make estimates on real situations . the statement @xmath106 is true only for @xmath107 and @xmath2 sufficienly large , which is surely true for normal astrophysical objects , like sun and galaxies .",
    "the case of the immediate neighbourhood of a black hole horizon is more involved and goes beyond the aims of the present paper ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore see that eq .",
    "( [ ( 3.1 ) ] ) admits always two distinct positive values for @xmath108 .",
    "this means that in any case @xmath100 is monotonically increasing with @xmath2 .",
    "we shall see in a moment that this can be reconciled with the requirement that the metric should be of minkowski type at infinity .",
    "another problem is posed by the two disjoint solutions .",
    "we assume however that @xmath18 is sufficiently small to get the first term of eq .",
    "( [ ( 3.1 ) ] ) negligible in our case .",
    "we have thus to treat a much simpler equation ( a more accurate treatment and justification of this assumption is given in the next section ) , i.e. @xmath109 which leads to the growth of the newton parameter according to @xmath110 where we have set the integration constant , in order to obtain a correction to newton s law , as desired .    at large @xmath2 ,",
    "the newton parameter obeys therefore the approximately linear relation @xmath111 therefore , reverting to eq .",
    "( [ ( 2.37 ) ] ) , we see that the function @xmath112 tends asymptotically to the constant @xmath113 so that , by rescaling appropriately distance and time , we may obtain flat space .",
    "a very interesting feature of eq . ( [ ( 3.6 ) ] ) is that it gives just the correction necessary to obtain perfectly flat rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "let us indeed rewrite it as @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the galaxy mass , @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the distance rescaled according with a typical galaxy length @xmath118 .",
    "we see that the correction is effective at say @xmath119 , if we take @xmath120 . at the solar system scale",
    "we get ( @xmath121 ) @xmath122 and the correction is absolutely irrelevant .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , at large @xmath2 , we get for the radial velocities of galaxies the relation @xmath123 where the proportionality constant is equal to @xmath124 .",
    "now , the usual theoretical expression for the tully  fisher relation is @xmath125 , and is computed with the usual keplerian law for velocities . on the other hand , we have the observational relation @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the absolute magnitude , @xmath128 is the visual angle of the galaxy and @xmath129 is a number which depends on the optical band @xcite . the first coefficient , which is the only relevant one for our purpose , has small dependence on the band . if we consider also the theoretical definition of magnitude , i.e. @xmath130 where @xmath19 is the absolute luminosity , assumed proportional to the mass , and @xmath131 is again dependent on the band , but irrelevant , we obtain eventually @xmath132 so that we obtain a striking agreement with our eq .",
    "( 3.10 ) , unlike the work in @xcite , where no agreement with the empirical tully ",
    "fisher relation is found ( see comments in the last paragraph of section 4 therein ) .",
    "the reason for this improvement lies in the fact that , in our case , the correction ( 3.5 ) to the newtonian @xmath0 is not parametrized only by universal constants , but by the mass of the gravitating source of the field .",
    "what is instead depending only on universal constants is the proportionality coefficient @xmath133 in ( 3.10 ) .",
    "let us now consider again eq .",
    "( [ ( 3.1 ) ] ) and show that indeed its replacement with the much simpler eq .",
    "( [ ( 3.4 ) ] ) is justified .",
    "first , let us point out that , for any astrophysical object different from a black hole we may write safely @xmath134    then eq . ( [ ( 3.1 ) ] ) may be rewritten , in @xmath8 units , as @xmath135 where @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 is the schwarzschild radius of the object .",
    "we are considering only one of the two equations generated by eq .",
    "( [ ( 3.1 ) ] ) , the study of the other being made along the same lines .",
    "we see that we may reduce the number of relevant parameters to only two .",
    "this equation can be exactly solved in the cases @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the first corresponds to the solution examined in the previous section , which we rewrite here as @xmath141 where @xmath142 is an integration constant .",
    "the second case is possibly even more interesting , since it corresponds to chosing @xmath143 , which is closer to the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "there is then a trivial solution @xmath144 , as well as @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the integration constant .",
    "we see that this solution also tends asymptotically to a constant , and hence satisfies the consistency check stated at the beginnin of section 3 .",
    "if this regime is reached sufficiently late , an emulation of dark matter might be obtained again on taking a linearized approximation of ( 4.4 ) ( cf .",
    "comments in section 5 ) .",
    "everything depends on the values of the parameters and confrontation with observations .",
    "let us now show that the first solution dominates at large @xmath2 .",
    "for this purpose , let us consider the ratio of the first to the last term in eq .",
    "( [ ( 3.1 ) ] ) , i.e. @xmath147 it is clear that our approximate treatment will be good as long as @xmath148 .",
    "we substitute in @xmath149 the approximate solution and obtain @xmath150 the behaviour of this function is independent of @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it tends asymptotically to zero and has a maximum at @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , provided we start the integration at @xmath154 , if the approximation is valid there , it will be increasingly accurate as @xmath2 gets larger .    on the other hand , let us suppose that at @xmath155 the opposite occurs , and @xmath156 .",
    "we may thus substitute the other solution , finding @xmath157 we see that again the behaviour of @xmath158 is independent of @xmath159 and @xmath160 , but ( which is most important ) we always have that @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , even if at the beginning @xmath162 , as @xmath2 increases the condition is reversed and we may say ( approximately ) that , when @xmath163 , we may switch off this solution and revert to the first one , which prevails asymptotically .",
    "the intermediate situation is of course somewhat delicate , but a numerical analysis , made on the full equation , with suitable choice of the parameters involved , confirms these statements .",
    "in the first part of our paper , we have extended the hamiltonian analysis of spherically symmetric gravity @xcite to the case of variable newton parameter and variable cosmological term , obtaining eventually the non - linear differential equation ( 3.1 ) for @xmath100 , under the non - trivial assumption that eq .",
    "( 2.40 ) can be taken to hold .",
    "we have then shown that _ the treatment of @xmath164 and @xmath0 as dynamical variables , together with the fixed - point condition , gives encouraging chances of emulating the presence of dark matter in long - range gravitational interactions _",
    ", at least at galactic scale .",
    "several open problems should be now studied , i.e. 0.3 cm ( i ) the legitimacy of the fixed - point assumption . 0.3 cm ( ii ) the validity of eq .",
    "( 2.40 ) when @xmath0 depends on @xmath2 .",
    "0.3 cm ( iii ) the detailed numerical proof that also our solution ( 4.4 ) with vanishing cosmological constant can fit the flat rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "0.3 cm ( iv ) can our hamiltonian approach make it possible to study weak - lensing observations , that are recently found to provide a direct empirical proof of the existence of dark matter ?",
    "0.3 cm ( v ) how to perform the hamiltonian analysis with variable @xmath0 in the small-@xmath2 region which is relevant for black - hole physics ?",
    "the main source of future developments is the confrontation of our theoretical results with observational data .",
    "this is not a simple task , because a galaxy is not a pointlike source .",
    "therefore a separate paper is in order on this topic as well as the other open problems listed above . anyway , since the free parameters of our theory , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , depend on @xmath165 and @xmath97 , which are completely undetermined at the moment , we hope to be able to obtain reliable numerical solutions ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) , appropriate for comparison with observations .",
