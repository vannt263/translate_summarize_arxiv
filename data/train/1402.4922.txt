    "the concept of air shower universality dating back to pioneering works  @xcite is subjected to the remarkable rise of interest during the last decade  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in a broad sense",
    ", the so - called universality is expressed in the similarity of the spectra of low - energy particles in air showers at the same development stage .",
    "phenomenology , possible generalisations , deeper understanding of the origin and limitations of such properties are obviously important to unveil their potential in the achievement of the unambiguous physical interpretation of the results of comparisons between air shower observables and the appropriate theoretical calculations .",
    "various parameterizations of the correlations between different air showers characteristics have been obtained on the basis of universality ; attempts have been made to work out new experimental data processing techniques that could , for example , suppress or separate the influence of the hadronic interaction model and improve the reliability of the results .    in this paper",
    "we investigate perspectives of model - independent scaling approach for lateral distribution of electrons in nuclei- and photon - initiated air showers and also the universal dependence between shower age and root mean square radius of electron component for the improved analysis of the experimental data , particulary to extract information about the variations in elemental composition of cosmic rays in almost a model - independent way .",
    "according to the theoretically motivated scaling approach  @xcite , the electron lateral distribution function in both electromagnetic cascade showers ( emc ) initiated by high - energy photons and hadron - induced extensive air showers ( eas ) can be described with high accuracy by the scale - invariant form @xmath1 here @xmath2   local particle density at radial distance @xmath3 from the core in shower of primary energy @xmath4 observing at depth @xmath5 in the atmosphere , @xmath6   total number of particles at observation level ( shower size ) , @xmath7   radial scale factor , which , in contrast to commonly used ldf representations , depends on primary particle type and mass , shower age and ( in case of extensive air showers ) properties of hadronic interactions . using the results of extensive series of calculations we found  @xcite the following overall fit for scale - invariant part of lateral distribution : @xmath8 for electron ldf in emc and eas parameters of function  ( [ sfnew ] )",
    "are determined as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and scale factor @xmath7 in both cases is equal to the root mean sqare radius of electron component @xmath14 , defined in a standard way as : @xmath15 the validity of scaling function was confirmed by simulations for @xmath16  ev , @xmath17  g/@xmath18 , @xmath19 . the last condition corresponds to the radial distance range from @xmath20  m to @xmath21  km depending on the shower age .",
    "it was also found  @xcite that for average extensive air shower of particular energy , developing in real atmosphere , there is a one - to - one mapping between @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is air density at the observation depth , and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the depth of maximum of an average cascade curve .",
    "this allows us to propose the following parameterisation , which does not depend on energy , observation depth and also primary nuclear mass : @xmath26~{\\rm m},\\label{rms_app}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "equation  ( [ rms_app ] ) obviously represents the universal dependence between average shower width and age .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the described approach is that scaling property  ( [ scaling1 ] ) , scaling function  ( [ sfnew ] ) and parameterisation  ( [ rms_app ] ) are almost insensitive to hadronic interactions model implemented in calculations  @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 scatter plot for 500 simulated vertical extensive air showers initiated by protons and iron nuclei with @xmath31  ev at three observation depths ( @xmath32 ) . ]",
    "@xmath30 scatter plot for 500 simulated vertical extensive air showers initiated by protons and iron nuclei with @xmath31  ev at three observation depths ( @xmath32 ) . ]    in figure  [ rms(e ) ] energy dependences of root mean square radius of electron component are shown for vertical eas initiated by protons and iron nuclei at observation depth @xmath33 .",
    "the data were obtained from relation  ( [ rms_app ] ) using depths of maximum calculated with hadronic interactions models retuned on the basis of recent accelerator data as reported in  @xcite . the uncertainty in @xmath25 predictions is currently reduced to @xmath34 obviously improving the accuracy of conclusions based on comparisons between simulated and measured depths of maximum .",
    "as it is seen from figure  [ rms(e ) ] , considering radial scale factors of electron ldf estimated from the experimental data gives us another important source of information on primary composition .",
    "we also show in figure  [ rms(e ) ] the mean square radii of pure electromagnetic cascades initiated by primary gammas examining the influence of ultra - high energy effects   landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect and interaction of uhe photons and electrons with the geomagnetic field ( gmf ) .",
    "these data were obtained  @xcite on the basis of the numerical solution of adjoint cascade equations .",
    "the gmf intensity profile corresponds to conditions of auger observatory in argentina .",
    "one can see that for uhe primary gammas @xmath35 , keeping much smaller values comparing to eas , increases considerably with energy from @xmath36 to @xmath37 after interaction with geomagnetic field begins to affect shower development .",
    "this should be taken into account when @xmath35 is used for testing gamma - ray fraction in uhe cosmic rays flux .",
    "on the other hand , our calculations show that scaling formalism  ( [ scaling1])-([sfnew ] ) remains valid when lpm- and gmf - effects in emc are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "since for electron ldf in uhe extensive air showers only lpm - effect in partial electromagnetic cascades contributes to @xmath35 we expect that , barring dramatic changes in nuclear interactions , both scaling formalism  ( [ scaling1])-([sfnew ] ) and universality in form  ( [ rms_app ] ) will be kept up to @xmath38  ev .",
    "in our recent works  @xcite the experimental data of kascade , kascade - grande and msu eas arrays were analyzed with respect to the radial scale factors of electron lateral distribution in the framework of generalized scaling formalism taking into account the appropriate shower classification procedure .",
    "it was shown that uncertainty in the explicit form of lateral distribution function chosen for data fitting and bias of different nature in estimating the mean square radius of the eas electron component do not impede the extraction of information about mean primary mass change with energy .",
    "the variations of @xmath7 with energy obtained using different model ldfs from the experimental data of the above mentioned arrays give a consistent evidence of weighting of primary composition above the knee . according to the kascade - grande data it is followed by a rather sharp decrease of mean primary mass at @xmath39  @xcite , indicative in favor of a",
    " heavy knee \" in primary spectrum .    considering the applicability of such an analysis at very high energies for the experimental lateral distributions measured by largest air shower arrays it is important in what extent",
    "the universality property is affected by fluctuations in individual showers . in figure  [ xmaxrms ]",
    "the @xmath30 scatter plot is presented for 500 simulated vertical extensive air showers initiated by protons and iron nuclei with @xmath31  ev at three observation depths ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "observation depths are chosen in such a way as to analyze @xmath41 correlations in individual showers of different age .",
    "it is clear that for the majority of individual eas of particular energy @xmath42 level is located higher than depth of maximum , while sea level is considerably deeper than @xmath25 . at the same time",
    "@xmath43 roughly corresponds to the depth where fluctuations in shower size are minimal .",
    "dependence on the observation level could also be used to infer the dependence on the shower zenith angle .",
    "it is seen from figure  [ xmaxrms ] that strong correlation between root mean square radius and depth of maximum in individual extensive air showers is observed for showers of different ages and for both light and heavy primary nuclei , which , in addition , are separated quite well from each other on scatter plot .",
    "this fact suggests that implementation of radial scale factors into multicomponent analysis procedures , e.g. the principal component analysis , could be more efficient comparing with utilizing of other observables sensitive to primary particle type such as electron and muon shower sizes and local densities far from shower core position .",
    "of course , additional studies devoted to the reliable estimation of radial scale factors of electron ldf from the experimental data of largest ground - based air shower arrays taking into account realistic measurement uncertainties , detectors response and other experimental conditions are needed .",
    "this is essential especially for hybrid arrays measuring longitudinal and lateral profiles of the shower independently .",
    "the universality in extensive air shower development expressed by means of scale - invariant lateral distribution of electrons and the relation between root mean square radius and depth of shower maximum is evidently retaining in a common form in extremely wide primary energy range ( from @xmath44 to @xmath38  ev ) neglecting possible exotic hadronic phenomena",
    ". this formalism could be useful in development of new effective techniques for reanalysis , cross - checking and validation of the results of different experiments together with decreasing of the influence of hadronic model uncertainties allowing to raise confidence in the results coming from the comparisons between air showers observables and theoretical calculations ."
