    "it is well - known that the conventional description of brownian motion in terms of equations such as ( [ vbm ] ) , that of a heavy particle interacting with light scatterers , ignores the presence of hydrodynamic fluctuations . a more complete description would allow us not only to test the validity of the brownian motion model for the vortex but also to compute corrections to it and , possibly , to find new physical effects .",
    "our analytic approach rests on the use of a singular perturbation expansion around a rigid vortex utilizing a low - temperature or weak - noise expansion .",
    "we are able to derive a fokker - planck equation for the single vortex distribution function which corresponds to that of a passive scalar advected to a background flow [ not just a simple diffusion equation as would be predicted by eqs .",

    "vortices , however , interact logarithmically , so one can not confirm the exponential tails in @xmath69 directly by studying motion of a large aggregate of vortices in a sample . instead , one must study the motion of a single vortex , and measure the statistics of vortex flights .",
