    "this paper concerns the dynamics of a particle in certain two - dimensional systems which are infinitely extended in one dimension .",
    "more precisely , we will study dynamical systems in which a point particle moves in a strip ( or similar set ) @xmath0 , which contains a countable number of convex scatterers , see the example in fig .",
    "[ imgquadrati1 ] .",
    "the motion of the particle is free until it collides with either the boundary of @xmath1 or a scatterer , both of which are thought to have infinite mass .",
    "the collisions are totally elastic , so they obey the usual fresnel law : the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence .        [ imgquadrati1 ]    in the taxonomy of dynamical systems , these models belong to the class of semidispersing planar billiards . in particular , they are extended semidispersing billiards , which very much resemble a lorentz gas .",
    "we thus call them _ effectively one - dimensional lorentz gases _ or , more concisely , _ lorentz tubes ( lts)_.    systems like these ( especially their three - dimensional counterparts , cf .  last paragraph of this section ) find application in the sciences as models for the dynamics of particles ( e.g. , gas molecules ) in narrow tubes ( e.g. , carbon nanotubes )",
    ". a very minimal list of references , from the more experimental to the more mathematical , includes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( see further references in those papers . )",
    "an interesting fact is that both experimentalists and theoreticians seem to have a primary interest  sometimes for different reasons  in the same question , namely the diffusion properties of these gases .",
    "as we discuss below , this is our case as well , although the results we present in this note must be considered preliminary in this respect .    from a mathematical viewpoint , lts are interesting because they are among the very few extended dynamical systems , with a certain degree of realism , that mathematicians can prove something about . by the ill - defined expression _",
    "extended dynamical system _ we generally mean a dynamical system  on a non - compact phase space whose physically relevant ( invariant ) measure  is infinite . for such systems , the very fundamentals of ordinary ergodictheory do not work @xcite : for example , the poincar recurrence theorem fails to hold and one does not know whether the system  is totally recurrent ( almost every point returns arbitrarily close to its initial condition ) , totally transient ( almost every point escapes to infinity ) , or mixed .    in fact , as it turns out , recurrence is not just the most basic property one wants to establish in order to even consider studying the chaotic features of an extended dynamical system  ( it is sometimes said that , if ergodicity is the first of a whole hierarchy of stochastic properties that a dynamical system  can possess , recurrence is the _",
    "zeroeth property _ ) ; for a lorentz gas at least , a number of stronger ergodic  properties follow from recurrence : for example , ergodicity of the extended dynamical system , @xmath2-mixing of the first - return map to a given scatterer , etc .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us briefly explain our model .",
    "we consider the connected set @xmath0 tessellated by the repetition , under the action of @xmath3 , of a given _ fundamental domain _",
    "@xmath4 , which we assume to be a polygon .",
    "in each copy of @xmath4 , henceforth referred to as _ cell _ , we place a random configuration of convex _ scatterers _ , according to some rule that we specify later . given a global configuration of scatterers , we consider the billiard  dynamics in the complement ( to @xmath1 ) of the union of all the scatterers .",
    "so , each model just described does not correspond to one dynamical system , but to an _ ensemble _ of dynamical systems .",
    "in other words , we have a _ quenched random dynamical system _ , in the sense that first a system  is picked from a random family and then its ( deterministic ) dynamics is observed .",
    "this contrasts with random dynamical systems , such as the random billiard  channels of @xcite , @xcite , in which a new random map is applied at every iteration of the dynamics",
    ".    quenched random lts are a bit more realistic and understandably harder to study than random lts , which are in turn harder than _ periodic _ lts ( when the configuration of scatterers is the same in every cell ) .",
    "the same can be said of lorentz gases which are infinitely extended in both dimensions @xcite .",
    "in fact , while recurrence , the central limit theorem ( clt ) and several strong stochastic properties are known for periodic lorentz gases  at least under the so - called _ finite horizon _ condition  very little is known for random or quenched random lorentz gases ( although results were established for toy versions : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    as it turns out , when the effective dimension @xmath5 equals 2 , recurrence and the clt go hand in hand , as a remarkable theorem by schmidt ( theorem [ thm - co - rec ] below ) shows @xcite .",
    "this provides another strong motivation for the study of the diffusive properties of these gases , cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "we state the paper s main result in plain english , leaving a more rigorous description to the remainder of the article , in particular section [ sec - povp ] .",
    "this paper s main result is the _ almost sure _ recurrence of our quenched random lts , under very mild geometrical conditions which include the finite - horizon condition .",
    "almost sure recurrence means that almost every lt in the ensemble is poincar recurrent . to our knowledge , this is the first time that recurrence is proved for the typical element of a fairly general class of lorentz gases ( albeit effectively one - dimensional ) .",
    "the main ingredient of the proof is the above - mentioned theorem by schmidt , which is particularly powerful for @xmath6 .",
    "the exposition is organized as follows : in section [ sec - pre ] we give a precise definition of our lts and state some of their properties .",
    "then in section [ sec - rec ] we introduce the tools that we use to prove almost sure recurrence , namely schmidt s theorem and an ergodic  dynamical system  endowed with a suitable one - dimensonal cocycle .",
    "the latter objects are presented in detail in section [ sec - povp ] , where the main proof of the article is also given .",
    "finally , in sections [ sec - ext ] , we discuss some generalizations of our result .    due to its technicality and lesser strength , the very important generalization to the higher dimensional case will be presented elsewhere .",

    "( notice that in this hamiltonian system  the conservation of energy corresponds to the conservation of speed , which is thus conventionally fixed to 1 . )",
    "evidently , the above definition is a bit ambiguous since @xmath35 is discontinuous and there is a set of initial conditions for which it is not even well defined .",
    "we thus declare that @xmath36 is right - continuous ( i.e. , if @xmath31 is a collision time , @xmath37 is the _",

    "it follows that a finite segment of a _",
    "non_-singular trajectory depends continuously on its initial condition .",
    "also notice that , by ( a2 ) , the set of all singular trajectories is a countable union of smooth curves in @xmath56 and thus has measure  zero .",

    "@xmath25 and all @xmath57 , there is a non - singular trajectory entering @xmath7 through @xmath58 and leaving it through @xmath59 .    a convenient way to represent",
    "a continuous - time dynamical system  is to select a suitable poincar section and consider the first - return map there . for billiards ,",
    "the section is customarily taken to be the set of all pairs @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a post - collisional unit vector at @xmath45 ( hence an inner vector relative to @xmath62 ) .",
    "here we slightly modify this choice .",
    "for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , denote by @xmath65 the side of @xmath14 corresponding to @xmath59 in @xmath7 ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 may be called the _ gates _ of @xmath14 , whence the notation ) .",

    "we only consider those times at which the particle crosses one of the gates . in the lingo of billiards , cross sections like these are sometimes called `` transparent walls '' .",
    "the liouville measure  for the flow induces on a transparent wall an invariant measure  given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the normal to the section at @xmath45 , directed towards the outgoing side of @xmath76 @xcite ( in our case , @xmath77 whenever @xmath78 ) .",
    "so we end up with the dynamical system  @xmath79 , whose invariant measureis infinite and @xmath80-finite .",
    "notice that , by design , the only object that depends on the random configuration is the map @xmath81 .    in order to discuss the hyperbolic  properties of this system ,",
    "we need to introduce its local stable and unstable manifolds ( lsums ) . since our exposition does not require a rigorous definition of these objects , we shall refrain from providing one , and point the interested reader to the existing literature , e.g. , @xcite . here",
    "we just mention that , in our system , a local stable manifold ( lsm ) @xmath82 is a smooth curve containing @xmath44 and whose main property is that , for all @xmath83 , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the natural riemannian distance in @xmath86 ( with the convention that , if @xmath44 and @xmath87 belong to different connected components of @xmath86 , @xmath88 ) . a local unstable manifold ( lum ) @xmath89 has the analogous property for the limit @xmath90 .",

    "the next theorem is the core technical result for all the proofs that follow .",
    "it is not by chance that , in the field of hyperbolic  billiards , this is called the _ fundamental theorem_.    [ thm - connect ] given @xmath63 , @xmath96 and a full - measure  @xmath97 , there exists a full - measure  @xmath98 such that all pairs @xmath99 are connected via a polyline of alternating lsums whose vertices lie in @xmath100 .",

    "the above theorems are proved in @xcite for lorentz gases that are effectively two - dimensional and whose scatterers are smooth , i.e. , @xmath108 in ( a2 ) .",
    "the first of the two differences is absolutely inconsequential .",
    "the second affects the _ singularity set _ of @xmath109 , that is , the set of all @xmath92 whose trajectory , up to the next crossing of a transparent wall , is singular .",
    "it is a well - known and easily derivable fact that , in each component @xmath110 of the cross section , the singularity set is a union of smooth curves , each of which is associated to a specific source of singularity within the cell @xmath14 ( a tangential scattering , a vertex , the endpoint of a gate ) and an _ itinerary _ of visited scatterers before that .",
    "since both the number of scatterers in each cell and the number of vertices per scatterer are bounded , there can only be a finite number of _ singularity lines _ in each @xmath110 . with this provision , the proofs of @xcite work in this case as well .",
    "( in truth , the actual proofs are found in @xcite , where the existence of a hyperbolic  structure and the fundamental theorem are shown for the standard billiard  cross section . in @xcite",
    "these are extended to the transparent cross section .",

    ", the ergodicity of the point of view of the particle implies the recurrence of our cocycle , because the cocycle is one - dimensional .",
    "thus , as long as we deal with systems in which the position of the particle can be described , in a discrete sense , by a one - dimensional cocycle , the foregoing arguments can be used to prove the almost sure recurrence of a more general class of lts .",
    "there is no reason why all the cells @xmath14 should be the same polygon .",
    "one can easily consider random cells @xmath14 in which the border too depends on the random parameter @xmath221 .",
    "this can be devised by putting extra flat scatterers in a sufficiently large cell in order to produce any desired shape ; see fig .",
    "[ imgcella ] .",
    "as long as each cell has two opposite congruent gates and ( a1)-(a5 ) are verified , all the previous results continue to hold .",
    "in fact , one can allow for the distance between the gates to vary with @xmath221 as well ( in ( [ eq - def - r ] ) simply replace @xmath222 with the cell - dependent local translation @xmath223 ) .",
    "an example of this type of lt is shown in fig .",
    "[ imgtubodiverso ] .",
    "one can also define @xmath59 to be the union of a finite number of sides @xmath224 , with @xmath225 varying in some index set @xmath199 , provided that there is a translation @xmath11 such that @xmath226 ; see fig .",
    "[ imgesagoni2 ] .",
    "however , in order for steps 2 and 3 of the proof of theorem [ thm - povp - erg ] to hold , ( a5 ) needs to be replaced by              another hypothesis that is not crucial is that @xmath9 is mapped onto @xmath10 via a translation .",
    "one can imagine that @xmath3 acts upon the lorentz tube via a general isometry , for example a roto - translation , as in fig .",
    "[ imgtuboarrotolato1 ] .",
    "the only problem , in this case , is that , quite generally , the resulting tube will have self - intersections .",
    "one can simply do away with it by disregarding the self - intersections , e.g. , by declaring that any two portions of the tube that intersect in the plane actually belong to different sheets of a riemann surface .",
    "assume that the fundamental domain is a polygon @xmath4 such that @xmath230 of its sides ( @xmath231 ) are congruent .",
    "in this case it is possible to randomize the choice of the gates too .",
    "that is , one can let the random parameter @xmath221 decide which of the @xmath230 congruent sides of @xmath14 will play the role of the `` left '' and `` right '' gates .",
    "moreover , @xmath221 can also prescribe how the right gate of @xmath14 attaches to the left gate of @xmath232 ; see fig .",
    "[ imgtubonuovo ] .        in order to implement this idea ,",
    "we need to slightly change our previous notation .",
    "let @xmath233 be a fixed ordering of the @xmath230 congruent sides of @xmath4 mentioned above .",
    "for any such @xmath234 , let @xmath146 denote the transparent , incoming , cross section relative to @xmath59 , as in ( [ def - nnj ] ) .",
    "then set @xmath235 .      in lieu of @xmath159 , cf .",
    "( [ eq - def - r ] ) , we use the more general map @xmath242 defined as follows . for @xmath243 , let @xmath59 be the first side of its kind that the forward flow - trajectory of @xmath44 hits within @xmath4 , and denote by @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively , the hitting point in @xmath59 and the precollisional velocity there ( see fig .  [ imgromega ] ) .    * if @xmath244 then @xmath245 . here",
    "@xmath246 is the transformation that rigidly maps the outer pairs @xmath247 based in @xmath59 onto the inner pairs based in @xmath248 ( it is a rototranslation in the @xmath45 variable ) ; and @xmath249 , depending on the usual random parameter @xmath239 , is either the identity or the transformation that flips all the segments @xmath250 and changes the @xmath61 variable accordingly .",
    "so , through @xmath251 , @xmath221 decides whether @xmath14 and @xmath232 have the same or opposite orientations ( cf .",
    "[ imgtubonuovo ] ) . in this case , the exit function  is set to the value @xmath252 . *",
    "if @xmath253 then , in accordance with the previous case , @xmath254 ( notice that @xmath255 ) . in this case , @xmath256 .",
    "* for all the other @xmath234 , @xmath257 , where @xmath258 is the postcollisional velocity corresponding to a billiard  bounce against @xmath59 with incoming velocity @xmath154 ( @xmath68 denoted the inner normal to @xmath59 ) .",
