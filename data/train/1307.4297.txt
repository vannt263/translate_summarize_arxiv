    "the surprising discovery that half of the satellites of the andromeda galaxy lie in a thin plane with ordered motion @xcite introduces a new challenge to theories of galaxy formation . in a canada - france - hawaii telescope survey of 400 sq .",
    "deg around m31 , called pandas , the number of known m31 satellite galaxies was increased to 34 , of which 27 are dsph .",
    "fifteen of these satellites were found to lie in a thin plane @xmath1 kpc thick that stretches up to 600 kpc along the plane @xcite .",
    "sharing the plane are m31 and , beyond the pandas footprint , lgs3 , ic1613 @xcite , and our own milky way ( mw ) .",
    "martin et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have found yet another satellite in the plane from imaging with pan - starrs .",
    "the plane is seen nearly edge on to us , so there is little doubt about its validity .",
    "galaxies to the galactic north of m31 are redshifted with respect to m31 and on the south side they are blueshifted .",
    "the distribution of the dwarfs has a front to back asymmetry with the majority in front of m31 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that all the m31 satellites at higher galactic longitude than the pandas plane , including the spiral galaxy m33 , lie in a second plane slightly tilted from the first .",
    "as it turns out , this plane has a roughly similar width and extent as the first plane .",
    "he also noted that almost all galaxies in the adjacent centaurus group lie in two parallel planes .",
    "it has long been known that most dwarf galaxies near the mw are aligned on a great circle in the sky that passes close to the galactic pole @xcite .",
    "altogether then , we now find that 43 of the 50 local group ( lg ) satellites within 1.1 mpc , lie within the 4 planar structures : the plane reported by ibata et al .",
    ", the adjacent plane noted by tully , and two milky way satellite planes that we delineate here .",
    "these discoveries stress the standard theory of hierarchical clustering by cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "it was already appreciated that cdm theory predicts that there should be more satellite galaxies than observed @xcite .",
    "attempts to reconcile this include assuming that gas was lost from low mass halos due to supernovae driven winds , or that collapse of gas into low mass halos was suppressed by reionization heating , rendering most of them invisible .",
    "now it appears , that the few visible dwarf galaxies lie in distinctive structures so thin that their formation may have required dissipational processes .",
    "it has been suggested that the thinness of the plane of andromeda satellites could be explained by a tidal tail from a merger with m31 ( hammer et al 2013 ) . in this scenario , a medium sized galaxy merged with m31 about 9 gyr ago . the gas and dust from one of the tidal tails dissipated into a thin disk , and then fragmented into dsph galaxies .",
    "however if this is a common means of forming dsphs it is difficult to understand the typically elevated velocity dispersions in dsphs which have been taken to indicate high mass - to - light ratios and thus significant amounts of dark matter .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the dark matter in a galaxy is too high to remain bound to a small lopped off piece of it .",
    "yet another difficulty with the idea of dsph originating in tidal tails is explaining why the luminosity - metallicity relation continues into the dsphs luminosity range ( cheng et al .",
    "if they are remnants of larger galaxies , then their metallicities should be more akin to those of more luminous galaxies .",
    "however , cold dark matter simulations have not been totally stumped by highly anisotropic distributions of dwarf galaxies in groups . to understand the odd planar distribution near the mw @xcite conducted constrained n - body simulations that formed , at high resolution , a group of galaxies with properties matching the local group . at lower resolution ,",
    "the simulation extended 64 @xmath2 mpc and included external structures like the virgo cluster and coma cluster .",
    "for each of the mw and m31 analogues , there was a stream of matter out to 5 virial radii falling toward the galaxy and the direction of emanation was close to the virgo cluster .",
    "this matches the observed mw anisotropy of dwarf galaxies because the direction to the virgo cluster happens to be only @xmath3 from the galactic pole .",
    "more generally , simulations including both dark matter particles and gaseous hydrodynamics @xcite have found that it is typical for 70% of the material influx into @xmath4 haloes at z = 0 to come in along 3 dominant streams .",
    "these streams are embedded in sheets which bring another 20% of the influx .",
    "unlike the larger scale filaments , these filaments are not necessarily at the intersections of sheets ; they are just within the sheets .",
    "@xcite find that when there are 3 or more sheets , two are likely to be at small angles from each other forming a plane extending on both sides of the halo .",
    "thus , simulations predict that most of the material falling into giant galaxies follow along thin streams and sheets , and anisotropic distributions of satellites are now expected within the standard dark matter scenario .",
    "but questions remains as to how galaxies that have fallen through the potential of the giant galaxy , some repeatedly , remain in these coherent planes .",
    "if it is even slightly out of the plane , a dwarf passing a giant galaxy would typically be thrown well out of the plane .",
    "unless all of the dwarf galaxies in planes are falling in for the first time , there remains an issue of maintaining them in thin planes .",
    "even more puzzling , the second plane near m31 is 100 kpc offset from the m31 and the timescale for buckling in toward m31 would only by a few @xmath5 100 myr .",
    "it is hard to see how this plane can be interpreted as one of the persistent filaments of dark matter formed in n - body simulations .",
    "these discoveries come upon us as we are immersed in a program to study the orbits of local group galaxies using numerical action methods ( nam ) .",
    "the nam technique solves for the orbits of many bodies under mutual gravitational attraction in a cosmological context and makes use of mixed boundary value constraints .",
    "it combines present day positions with early time constraints on the peculiar velocities to attain the necessary number of phase space constraints .",
    "mutual trajectories are sought that have peculiar velocities consistent with linear perturbation theory at a chosen early epoch ( see the appendix for more details ) .",
    "the nam technique , also know as least action , has been used to calculate the orbits of : the local group @xcite , galaxies out to 2,000 @xmath6  @xcite , and galaxies out to 3,000 @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown to reconstruct the orbits of halos in n - body simulations in reliability tests @xcite , although it is noted that on scales of a group , a confusion from multiple solutions can arise that may require additional constraints like proper motions to resolve .",
    "we focus here on the part of the model that includes the milky way and other galaxies within about 1.5 mpc .",
    "the arrangement of galaxies into planar structures however means that there must be similarities in proper motions among members of a plane and that could provide the additional constraints needed to eliminate many of the possible solutions .",
    "the existence of planes implies commonalities in velocity directions , giving essential clues for reconstructing the formation history of the local group .",
    "if we discover how to make use of these convoluted constraints , we could reconstruct the development of the planes and the present configuration of the lg .",
    "if the effort fails , it could point to the need for additional physics that has been left out of the standard cosmological picture .    despite the daunting complexity of the task",
    ", we pushed forth in search of simple dynamical orbits that fit the excellent new data and were consistent with a natural explanation for these thin planes .",
    "since there were many parameters that could potentially be varied to get a fit ( distances could vary by 5% , masses could vary by large factors , and redshifts could vary by several @xmath6  to allow for sloshing between the dark matter and the baryons ) , we were worried that a good fit might result because of clever adjustments . therefore we chose to vary essentially nothing in this first attempt .",
    "some freedom comes from the selection of one orbit from the handful of acceptable solutions .",
    "our motivation , after all , is not necessarily to get excellent fits , but to get ideas on what physics could have played a role in developing these thin planes and to provide guidelines for initial density distributions for future constrained n - body simulations of the lg .    on the observational side , there are now good constraints from accurate distances , velocities , and now some relevant proper motions ( m31 , m33 , ic10 , and leoi ) for the local group .",
    "the dwarfs carina , fornax , sculptor , leoii and ursa minor also have proper motion measurements , but their uncertainties at this time are too large to usefully constrain the multiple orbits .",
    "the lmc and smc also have proper motion measurements , and we briefly discuss our skepticism about finding definitive trajectories for them .    with our orbit reconstruction effort ,",
    "it isl important that we incorporate the tidal influences of structures at larger scales .",
    "in addition to the familiar components like nearby large galaxies , the virgo cluster @xcite , and the distant but massive great attractor region @xcite , there is the _ absence _ of pull from the local void @xcite .",
    "these large scale components , although not directly the topic of this article , turn out to be necessary support players in the development of the planes , therefore the models at larger scales are briefly presented .    in  [ sec : data ] we briefly discuss the data on lg galaxies that we took both from the literature and from our own large projects to obtain high precision distances . in  [ sec : methodology ] we present our new hybrid numerical methodology which combines nam for giant galaxies with a new `` backtracking '' technique for dwarf galaxies that iterates backwards in time from the present positions . in  [ sec : results ] we show solutions for the mw / m31/m33 orbits extracted from our large scale solution that includes about 180 galaxies / groups / clusters out to @xmath7 50 mpc .",
    "then , we use backtracking to add the orbits of the lg dwarfs by finding which directions of the their present day velocities are consistent with linear perturbation theory and with residing in its plane , if it is in a plane . after selecting the one ` best ' velocity direction for each galaxy ,",
    "we look for properties of the z=4 distribution that contributed to the formation of the observed planes . ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] provides an overview of the different planes and describes what possible physical processes were involved in the plane formations . ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] reviews the results and discusses future tests .",
    "the appendix presents mathematical details of the current implementation of nam and the backtracking routine .",
    "to begin dynamical analyses of the lg , we need good distance and redshift measurements to constrain the present position - velocity vectors . we also use total luminosities to infer masses , but accuracy in luminosity is needed only for the three most massive galaxies because they dominate the gravitational potential so completely . since the local group contains the closest galaxies to us , there is a wealth of excellent data on most of its members that includes multiple , highly reliable distance determinations and redshifts based on well resolved stars . the newly discovered dwarf galaxies near m31 are the worst cases in that they each only have one tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) measurement with distance errors in the range of 5% @xcite .",
    "in table[table : input ] , we present the input data for each galaxy in the local group .",
    "this includes distance , k - band luminosity , position , and recessional velocity .",
    "it also provides which of 4 lg planes it resides in , numbered 1 - 4 , and 0 means it is not in one of the planes .",
    "k - band luminosities are from the 2mass all - sky extended source catalog @xcite or 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite , or in the case of dwarfs , from b to ks color transfers as given by @xcite .",
    "distances are collected from a multitude of authors .",
    "the methods include the cepheid period - luminosity relation @xcite , the related rr lyrae relation @xcite , the horizontal branch luminosity @xcite , eclipsing binaries @xcite , and the standard candle of the trgb @xcite .",
    "the large number of new dwarfs near m31 have homogeneously derived trgb distances based on a bayesian statistical analysis of the color - magnitude diagram @xcite .",
    "other distances are computed from a trgb maximum likelihood technique @xcite .",
    "measurement of proper motions of nearby galaxies has recently seen its dawn and is a great boon to dynamical analyses . in @xcite , the proper motion of two h@xmath80 masers of m33 provided the distance and proper motion of the galaxy .",
    "the error in proper motion with a baseline of just 3 years was 7.3 @xmath9 .",
    "m33 appears to be moving upward in supergalactic latitude , sgb , toward m31 .",
    "very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) measurements of an h@xmath80 maser have also provided a proper motion of ic10 @xcite with errors of @xmath10 in each component or a total error of 42 @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting total velocity is upward in sgz and away from m31 . a hubble space telescope ( hst ) measurement of the proper motion of m31 @xcite is based on observations of 3 regions within the galaxy with @xmath73 year baselines .",
    "resultant errors are 12 @xmath9 in each orthogonal component . the transverse velocity of m31 is found to be 33 @xmath11 34 @xmath6 , assuming the orbital velocity of the local standard of rest is 240 @xmath6 , and indicates motion almost directly toward the mw .",

    "there are two approaches to an understanding of the dynamics that led the local group to its present configuration : 1 ) run sufficient n - body simulations , with adaptive mesh refinement for precision on small scales , until one finds in one of them a group that closely resembles the local group , or 2 ) use a celestial mechanics like technique that solves for possible orbits constrained by the known position , velocity , and masses going backwards in time .",
    "the former has the disadvantages that incorrect assumptions in the initial perturbation spectrum at small scales and other errors in the very early stages of small scale structure could lead to problems in developing the lg planes . in this work ,",
    "we use the latter method to ensure solutions are fully compatible with the observed distribution .",
    "however , by going this route , we miss out on a quantitative measure of the probability of occurrence for the lg planes .",
    "the numerical action methodology assumes that galaxies assembled at high redshift , and that the subsequent assembly of groups of galaxies is a consequence of the motions induced in galaxies by other galaxies in the vicinity . at early times the deviations from hubble flow were small and follow linear perturbation theory .",
    "the orbits are parameterized by their positions at a discrete set of times and represent the center of mass motions of all of the matter that is present today in a galaxy .",
    "the nam derivation @xcite does not refer to mass excesses but rather depends on total masses associated today with the bound systems and therefore masses are held constant .",
    "an orbit should therefore faithfully reproduce the true center of mass motion as long as the majority of the associated matter was relatively nearby at the first time step which we have chosen to be z=4 ( a = 0.2 ) . for this work",
    ", we used the original version of nam in which positions are fixed and redshifts are free .",
    "an alternate version has been devised in which redshift is fixed and distances are free @xcite .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are assumed .",
    "separate mass - to - light constants are taken for ellipticals and spirals .",
    "mass distributions are taken to grow linearly with distance from the centers until outermost radii which are set to be proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "each trial of the nam procedure begins with random walk paths for every galaxy as initial guesses .",
    "each path is ` relaxed ' to a physically plausible path by making an adjustment to positions at each timestep that decrease the derivatives of the action until the path is at an extremum of the action ( see appendix ) .",
    "an iterative procedure takes turns relaxing each galaxy and moving on to the galaxy furthest from relaxed as determined by the sum of the squares of the derivatives .",
    "the derivatives are multiplied by the mass of the object to give priority to the higher mass systems which need to be settled before the lower mass systems can be correctly relaxed .",
    "after many iterations one arrives at extrema of the action .",
    "since the problem is inherently multi - valued , this entire procedure , starting from random walk paths , is repeated many times until one is confident that all solutions have been found .",
    "early on , when modeling regions larger than 10 mpc , the matter density that provided the best fit on small scales caused general outflow in the outer parts of the model and fell well short of providing the wmap value for @xmath16 therefore , we introduced a smooth density component @xmath17 to supplement the density in observable structures .",
    "there are physical reasons to justify this addition to the model .",
    "n - body simulations show that there is a 25 - 35% component of dark matter particles that is not in galaxies , groups , or clusters .",
    "much of this matter remains along filaments or sheets .",
    "in addition , much dark matter escapes entirely from its parent structure formations as a result of tidal forces during encounters and mergers .",
    "this makes sense if one considers that much of the dark matter in galaxies is less bound than any of the baryonic matter , and some of the baryonic material becomes unbound in tidal interactions .",
    "the overall fitting improves considerably with the addition of this parameter .",
    "there were several weaknesses with the nam procedure which needed to be addressed before tackling the more complex orbits that we would face at spatial scales @xmath18 1 mpc .",
    "first , there was no guaranty that , within a reasonable number of trials , any single trial would have all galaxies with the correctly chosen trajectories of all of the multiple solutions there is no known relation between the reality of a trajectory and how often it is realized in nam .",
    "the procedure is to continue to make runs until no new solutions arise after a  large number \" of additional runs . while this sounds reasonable",
    ", it presumes that there are no real trajectories that have vanishing low probability of being reached when starting with random initial paths .",
    "however , an actual trajectory that passed through deep inside the potential of a giant galaxy would be realized rarely by relaxing from random initial guesses because if , in the calculation , it passed through the giant galaxy at a slightly different path , then it could have a very different position at the first time step from the real one . at this remote location ,",
    "the local gradients are highly unlikely to lead toward the correct initial position .",
    "another problem is that it is difficult to make use of proper motions since this is an output parameter and one may need to make many trials to get a match for just one proper motion",
    ". if it is a giant galaxy , then inevitably all of the orbits of nearby galaxies are also wrong until the match is found",
    ". it would be preferable if one could constrain trial orbits by the known proper motions to begin with .",
    "lastly , the nam procedure has no way to accept solutions that are ` good enough ' as it always searches for solutions in which each galaxy reaches its extrema with essentially machine accuracy . at late times",
    "this is a reasonable criterion , but at the first time step it seems reasonable to believe that the potential field from nam is never exactly right because its source is only a small number of discrete points .",
    "therefore , the initial velocity need not be exactly what perturbation theory requires based on this potential .",
    "it is nice to have complete self - consistency , but inflexibility in the initial velocity could result in throwing out solutions that are actually fairly close to reality",
    ".    there is a way to address these issues for the dwarf galaxies .",
    "once the general potential is solved based solely on a nam procedure with the giant galaxies , a dwarf galaxy s path can be calculated by time reversed integration of the equations of motion , starting from its present position and velocity .",
    "the fact that we only know redshifts for these galaxies , and thus only radial velocities , translates into a problem of finding the best direction for each galaxy s velocity , a 2 dimensional problem with parameters , @xmath19 , the supergalactic l and b directions of the velocity in the mw frame of rest .",
    "as long as the dwarf galaxy did not interact with another dwarf galaxy , altering its orbit probably has no significant affects on other galaxies or the time dependent potential of the nam solution",

    "we ran some experiments in the most complicated cases with 400 time steps and found that the results were not significantly different .",
    "since most of the mass of the hydra / centaurus / norma supercluster was put into norma and therefore into the external tidal field tensor , the flow pattern of the model does not generate much motion in that direction . within the local group only mw , m31 , and m33",
    "were included .",
    "the masses were set by multiplying the luminosity by a mass - to - light ratio and were held constant .",
    "as mentioned , a recent measurement of m31 s proper motion by @xcite indicates a fairly radial motion into the mw ( transverse velocity @xmath32 assuming the sun s lsr is @xmath33 ) .",

    "+      +     when backtracking galaxies near a giant galaxy , each would have a dozen or so solutions with acceptable initial velocities , but most of these had the galaxy falling in close to a giant galaxy and then executing many very tight orbits . since , we expect that orbital plunging from frictional dissipation and tidal field disruption would occur in such cases , we considered these not to be acceptable solutions .    typically , there would be 1 to 5 less complex orbits to choose from if we allowed for @xmath34 @xmath6  errors in initial velocities .",
    "to select from among these simple solutions , we chose the one that had present motion consistent with how the plane developed . for * planes1 and 2 * , this means having motion parallel to the plane in the m31 reference frame , and for * planes3 and 4 * , this means having motion parallel to its plane in the mw reference frame . in rare cases where there were two solutions with motion in the plane ,",
    "then the one with the lowest error at the first time step was selected . to keep this report at a reasonable length ,",
    "we only describe here our final choice paths .",
    "after all , the point here is not to be certain about the particular path of any given galaxy , but rather to look for physical processes that could explain the existence of thin planar galaxy structures so late in the development of a group . besides and12 , no galaxy needed to have its distance adjusted , and small velocity changes of 1 or 2 @xmath6  arose from inaccuracies in the procedure , not from attempts to improve the fits .",

    "the blueshifted subset of the * plane1 * galaxies , shown in figure  [ fig : plane1blue ] , started in the plane with a very narrow range in sgz and most went out between 800 and 1000 kpc from m31 in the @xmath0sgy direction .",
    "some have already been around m31 and gone back to the original side while others remained on the original side , but they are now moving together headed toward encounters with m31 . on the top of figure  [ fig : plane1blue ] , we show the paths in the m31 frame of reference and comoving coordinates . on the bottom , proper coordinates are used . in the upper right of the bottom set , we show the sgy - sgz plane after rotating by @xmath35 around sgy to orient * plane1 * edge - on .",
    "most of the motion has been restricted to the plane .",
    "one can also see in the sgx - sgy projection , the effects of the strengthening tidal field from the mw on the orbits of and12 and and14 , the most extreme blue - shifted satellites , whose orbits deviated far from ellipses after they flew by m31 . on the second half of their first orbit ,",
    "the orbits begin to align with the mw@xmath0m31 line , and on their second descent they become very well aimed at both m31 and mw .",
    "this occurs , we surmise , because of the rapidly growing tidal field of the mw near m31 .",
    "the tidal field provides more time and distance for their velocities and paths to come into alignment .",
    "however all of the motion has been taking place within * plane1 * , hence this phenomenon was not needed , in this case , to bring these galaxies into a single plane , although it helped to further blueshift their velocities .",
    "currently all are located at lower sgy than m31 and have fairly high sgy velocities , which account for most of their blueshift with respect to m31 , even though , in sgx , most are moving away from us .",
    "and1 , lgs3 and ic1613 are still on their first approaches to m31 .    m31 line parallel to the x - axis , and the normal to * plane1 * in projection is parallel to the z - axis . _ _ ]    the redshifted set is shown in figure  [ fig : plane1red ] and can be seen together with the blueshifted set in figure   [ fig : plane1 ] . in the @xmath35 rotated plot , one sees that only two , and13 and and17 , in the redshifted set have spent the entire hubble time in the present plane .",
    "they have looped around in various ways to positive sgy and are now falling away from us in sgy , but they remained in the plane .",
    "most of the redshifted set came from higher sgz than the blueshifted ones and began outside of * plane1*. ngc185 , and25 , and and30 run a fancy pattern that lets them drop in sgz .",
    "they pass under m31 and then shoot up in sgz . after they reach their apocentric points ,",
    "the rest of their paths resemble those of and12 and and14 of the blueshifted set .",
    "they precess into a loop executed just below the mw - m31 line but , having been pulled away from m31 , they have the time and path length to become well aimed along the mw - m31 line . but these galaxies end up moving away from us in sgy and that gives them a positive velocity with respect to m31 .    *",
    "lg plane2 * is obvious in an sgy - sgz projection as a line of ten galaxies , including m33 , running below m31 in sgz .",
    "four of its members , and2 , and 5 , and10 , and and16 , were in a line at greater sgx than the * plane1 * galaxies at z=4 ( figure  [ fig : plane2 ] ) .",
    "and22 has been bound to m33 from the beginning and the pair seem to have taken a unique route to the plane . and24 and and23 dropped down from higher sgz than other * plane2 * galaxies .",
    "+     the * plane2 * galaxies executed either a single or double passby of m31 .",
    "those that have executed a double pass reached peri - galactic points on the @xmath0sgz side of m31 , which sent them to high sgz .",
    "they then passed m31 headed back to the negative sgz side .",
    "those executing a single pass , go over the top of m31 in sgz , which pulls them simply towards the negative sgz side .",
    "their distribution has been focused by m31 s gravity to under 100 kpc distances from m31 .",
    "they are all close to their turnaround in their sgz component .",
    "this results in them gathering at the sgz location of the plane and to spread out in the other components , much like the top of a water spout that has reached its maximum height .",
    "in other words , * plane2 * may be a density cusp that occurs at turnaround points when objects fall into a potential from similar heights .",
    "* plane2 * and * plane1 * intersect at the leading sides of both , forming a v. consequently , and16 and and9 , near the vertex , could be considered to be in * plane1 * as well .",
    "the gap of the v appears to be due to the fact that galaxies spend little time in that region since they pass through there immediately after getting a downward boost as they pass m31 .    * the m31-m33 hi bridge *",
    "may be comprised of debris scattered from interactions of m31 with and2 and perhaps and 15 .",
    "we plot the paths of these galaxies on the plane of the sky overlaid on a pandas image of andromeda with hi contours , taken from @xcite in figure  [ fig : bridge ] .",
    "and15 and and2 have passed through the disk of m31 in the past 0.7 gyr .",
    "tidal tails plus ram pressure driven gas from either of them and m31 may have created the hi bridge and the giant stellar stream @xcite of m31 .",
    "the warped outer gas disk of m31 has been given as evidence of an m31@xmath0m33 encounter .",
    "however , and22 is bound to m33 and their interactions could explain the highly distorted outer hi contours of m33 .        *",
    "leo a * ( see fig  [ fig : eachc ] ) has gone out far ( 700 kpc ) in sgy and has recently passed the mw@xmath0m31 plane and is far enough away that it has been primarily attracted to the center of mass of the local group rather than either of the giants .",
    "it thus has substantial tangential motion to us and perpendicular to * plane3 * , so it will eventually cross it . its present location happens to mark the point of convergence of the m31 and the mw in the lsc frame .    * and27 * and the more distant galaxy ngc6789 have too highly blueshifted velocities to be explained without invoking some interaction outside of the local group . both , it turns out , are in the direction of ngc6946 , and we have found solutions that involve the former two in tight interactions with it ( figure  [ fig : and27 ] ) .",
    "and27 was considered a * plane1 * member by @xcite , but we conclude that , like ic10 , it is just passing through and have removed it from * plane1 * membership . however , the redshift measurement for and27 is not of high signal - to - noise and may be flawed .",
    "the galaxies around the mw divide up into two thin planes .",
    "the outer dwarfs ( leoi , cetus dwarf spheroidal , wlm , leot , ngc6822 , ddo210 , and sagdig ) are in a plane with rms width of 34 kpc and 1.2 mpc in its longest extent",
    ". we will refer to this structure as * lg plane3*. the set of inner dwarf galaxies , * lg plane4 * , out to leoii , at 220 kpc , plus phoenix , at 410 kpc has an rms in the distances from the best fit plane of only 11.3 kpc .",
    "planes with slightly different sets of satellite galaxies , have been discussed previously @xcite , except that we do not include the lmc or smc , for reasons discussed below .",
    "these two mw planes were presented in figure  [ fig : presentplanes ] .",
    "our best model orbits for * plane3 * are presented in figure  [ fig : plane3 ] , and for * plane4 * , in figure  [ fig : plane4 ] .",
    "motions in comoving coordinates and the lsc frame for both * plane3 * and 4 are shown in figure  [ fig : plane3d ] .",
    "the view is edge - on to * plane3 * and nearly normal to * plane4*. the location of the starting points , at z=4 , for most of the galaxies in the two planes was the tilted initial plane shown in figure  [ fig : initial ] .",
    "+             an intriguing question is , why are these planes nearly perpendicular to the m31@xmath0mw line , when m31 is presently the dominant tidal stressor ?",
    "the mw , in the lsc frame of reference has been mostly moving toward the virgo cluster at sgx , y , z=(@xmath03.7,16.3,@xmath00.7 ) and partly moving to lower sgz .",
    "interestingly , * plane3 * galaxies tight - roped in between m31 and the mw .",
    "they were either between m31 or arriving from large distances and therefore attracted to the lg center of mass rather than either one of the giants .",
    "only recently did they begin to clearly fall toward the mw .",
    "most are still behind , never having had a close flyby of the mw .",
    "the angle between the plane and the mw motion is simply due to a change in gravitational dominance from the center of mass at earlier times to the mw more recently .    for * plane4 * , most started at about the same sgz level as the mw and so have been interacting closely with it .",
    "again , one sees that the direction of greatest elongation of * plane4 * s distribution is aligned with the mw large scale motion .",
    "the particular orientation of the best fitting plane , and the high axial ratio for * plane4 * depends a great deal on phoenix .",
    "but , phoenix is an intermediate to * plane3 * in that it started fairly far from the mw and still has not had a near interaction with the mw , although it has always been on the far side of the mw from m31 .",
    "in addition , both of the mw planes are oriented close to the neutral points in the tidal field of m31 , where there is a balance between inward forces along the perpendicular and outward forces along the line to the source of the tide . perhaps , avoiding either inward or outward forces was helpful for the survival of these galaxies .",
    "natural selection may be very important to understanding these structures in that satellites that did not evade the m31 tidal field might more readily have been destroyed . in figure",
    "[ fig : plane3 ] , one notes that the z=4 distribution simply began quite narrow perpendicular to the plane and already wide in sgy .",
    "the small range in initial sgx for * plane3 * and 4 galaxies could be attributed to the fact that the mw sits between m31 and the cena group . assuming the ratio of masses for m31 and the mw is similar to the luminous ratio",
    ", then m31 would have pulled in galaxies quite close to the mw on its side .",
    "centaurusa , now at 3.6 mpc , was only 1.6 mpc away as recently as z = 1 ( t@xmath76 gyr ) . at this time",
    ", m31 was just reaching its maximum separation from the mw of @xmath71 mpc .",
    "the roche limit radii at the mw of m31 and cena were , therefore , comparable at z @xmath39 1 .",
    "* lmc and smc * have been examined but do not have any definitive solution that we can find . all allowed solutions , given the mw mass being used in this model of @xmath40 , result in these two satellites remaining tightly bound satellites . for an assumed v@xmath41 of 240 @xmath6 ,",
    "the tangential velocity is 313 @xmath6   and the radial motion is 54.7 @xmath6 , for a ratio of 0.17 .",
    "thus , the ratio of the energies is 3% .",
    "this is unique among the satellite galaxies and is probably an indication that the lmc has undergone circularization from dynamical friction .",
    "the smc has less total energy than the lmc and simply does not have the energy that would be expected if it fell from a substantial distance from the mw .",
    "it too must have undergone substantial orbital dissipation .    as a check",
    "that there has been enough time for dynamical friction to have played an important role in the magellanic clouds we use equations 3 and 5 in @xcite , which together give for the dynamical friction time for angular momentum loss of a massive object inside a host halo as : @xmath42 where m is the satellite mass , @xmath43 is the density of the host at the position of the satellite , @xmath44 is circular velocity in the rotation curve of host at this point , @xmath45 is the dimensionless coulomb logarithm , and @xmath46 is the velocity of the satellite divided by @xmath44 .    assuming the host is an isothermal spherical galaxy , we can substitute @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the mass interior to r of the host and @xmath50 is orbital period around the center of the host at r , to find the convenient formula for dynamical time : @xmath51    as a concrete example , take a satellite orbiting the mw with velocity 1.5 times the local circular velocity and @xmath52 .",
    "if we set @xmath53 = 10 gyr , then we find @xmath54 at 50 kpc .",
    "since @xmath50 and @xmath49 grow linearly with r , this mass limit scales as @xmath55 . if a mw satellites has mass below this estimate , it probably has not yet lost much orbital energy from dynamical friction .",
    "but for galaxies with masses near or above this mass limit , one needs to consider how much time has been spent at small galactic radii . at 50 kpc and with tangential velocities",
    "much greater than radial velocities , a reasonable case can be made that both the lmc , with stellar mass of @xmath56 , and the smc , with total mass of @xmath57 @xcite , have undergone significant circularization of their orbits .",
    "on the other hand , all of the other satellites in this study appear to be safely below this red line in mass , provided that a majority of initial mass has not been lost .",
    "the ngc3109 association , including antlia , sextansa , and sextansb , has always been a bit of a puzzle .",
    "it is @xmath71.3 mpc from the mw , near to the lg turn around radius , yet the redshifts of these four galaxies in the mw frame are between 120 and 160 @xmath6  or effective hubble constant of @xmath58 km / s / mpc rather than an expectation of nearly zero .",
    "until now it was thought that the explanation required that the mw has a substantial velocity away from their direction .",
    "but , if the proper motion measurement of m31 is correct , then the motion of the mw is nearly perpendicular to their direction .",
    "the group simply has to come through or around the lg at very high velocities . our solutions from backtracking ( figure  [ fig : n3109 ] )",
    "have these galaxies beginning very close to the mw s line of motion and interacting with the mw to gain their high velocities through gravitational assists .",
    "it appears that the underlying cause of the gravity assist is the tidal fields from m31 and cena and the entire local sheet . at early times ,",
    "m31 and cena provided a large tidal field that accelerated the association inward toward the mw , but by the time the galaxies passed the mw , the gravity fields from m31 and cena had subsided considerably .",
    "the time dependent asymmetry provided the extra energy they needed to get away from the mw with some excess velocity . for antlia , sextans a and sextans b , a single pass from trailing to leading the mw @xmath7 7 gyr ago at @xmath7 25 kpc from the galactic center generated the needed impulse . for ngc3109 , there were two passes by the mw separated by 1.5 gyr and getting as close as 24 kpc .",
    "+     this discussion settles an issue over whether these dwarf galaxies form a separate group .",
    "they should be considered local group galaxies since one needs to consider them when doing the dynamics of the local group .",
    "ngc 3109 , sextansa , and sextansb are probably dominated by dark matter halos @xcite with dark matter to baryon ratios out to the last measured points of between 4 and 9 .",
    "therefore , these are probably not tidal remnants from a merger or disruptive encounter with the mw , and they made these close flybys without losing their dark matter .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this work is only a first cut at solving orbits for these planes of galaxies in that none of the relevant parameters that would normally be adjusted to create a better looking model were adjusted .",
    "specifically , we chose not to make use of the @xmath75% distance uncertainties , the nearly completely unconstrained mass - to - light ratio for individual galaxies , or a possible several @xmath6   disparity between measured baryonic motion at the center of a galaxy and the center of mass motion of a galaxy s dark matter .",
    "only one galaxy needed its distance altered to find a solution consistent with the potential from the early time distribution of galaxies out to large distance .",
    "a single mass - to - light ratio for all spiral galaxies and a slightly higher value for all elliptical galaxies in the entire sample were used . by not taking liberties with the free parameters ,",
    "we hopefully have explored a larger set of possible islands in phase - space that could create these planes .",
    "it could be that for each plane only one of these islands was actually populated and the other trajectories are spurious , but it is not too unreasonable that galaxies originating from two nearby initial islands happen to form a single plane .",
    "in particular , the redshifted and blueshifted * plane1 * galaxies do suggest two slightly different starting locations and different histories . this may have been theoretically predicted . in a statistical analysis of numerical simulations of cold flows",
    ", @xcite find that when there are 4 or more cold flows into a halo , the odds become favorable for two of them to share a common plane to within a few degrees .",
    "the picture here is somewhat different from the n - body+hydro code models that form several cold thin sheets in a group @xcite .",
    "we are finding that by z=4 nearly all of the lg dwarf galaxies were in a plane of filaments slighly tilted to the m31@xmath0mw line and this was all part of the wall to the local void .",
    "in fact , the overall appearance of the lg dwarf galaxies distribution at z=4 is that of a single closed filament or ring . then , in the process of falling into and orbiting the nearby giant galaxies , the ring broke up and assempled into four separate but related planes",
    ". a useful , but not necessary , ingredient to forming a very thin sheet is having a giant galaxy in the plane .",
    "the solution here for * plane2 * shows that some planes could be temporary turnaround cusps from an initial filamentary set of galaxies . in the end ,",
    "the thinness of these planes reminds us of the thinness of the larger scale local sheet and other walls around voids which also typically have high axial ratios .",
    "given that the standard lcdm model is essentially scaleless , it should not be too surprising to find structures on group scales as thin as those on a higher scale .",
    "it is encouraging , to see nam type calculations succeeding in producing early time filaments and sheets with such high axial ratios .",
    "most of the satellites in the local group appear to have been just 100 - 200 kpc higher in sgz at z=4 than the mw and m31 but still within the young local sheet .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the center of mass of the mw and m31 defined the center of the sheet and absorbed structures from both above and below them in nearly equal amounts .",
    "this would imply that nearly all of the satellites that were at or below the two giant galaxies have been consumed , and the existing satellites are the rare ones that managed to avoid that fate , so far .",
    "these last surviving satellite galaxies had special histories that allowed them to avoid the destruction that met hundreds of extinguished dwarf galaxies .",
    "one survival mechanism found in these solutions is to start at the far edges of the lg s portion of the local sheet , at the divide between the lg and other groups , where gravitational balancing slowed progress inward .",
    "it also appears that the tidal fields of the virgo cluster and the mw played roles in keeping many * plane1 * and * plane2 * galaxies at bay from m31 until recently . in our calculations , the early time lg distribution consisted of just 2 or 3 filaments , but there may have been others , at smaller radii from the giant galaxies , that were cannibalized .",
    "a video of the motions of the lg galaxies is available at our data site ( http://www.astro.umd.edu/@xmath7eshaya/lg .",
    "the degree of complexity is high and it takes time to understand all of the dynamical processes at play in the development of the planes .",
    "one notes , when watching the video , that the final structures developed rapidly in the last gyr or so .",
    "however , at each epoch there were other  great planes \" of satellites in other parts of the lg .",
    "we are led to the impression that it is not that a few planes of galaxies persisted throughout time , but rather that sets of galaxies went in and out of phase with each other at various places and times .",
    "some galaxies in * plane1 * did just move within a single plane , but a few executed strongly precessing orbital loops in which their semi - major axes dropped strongly and their motions came into alignment only in their last orbit .",
    "perhaps the ` missing satellite problem ' and the ` excess planar structure problem ' , the absence of planes reported in n - body simulations , are highly related .",
    "if the galaxies are constrained to very thin planes that preferentially go near the centers of giant galaxies , then satellites will be queued up , in lines of order 10 kpc thickness , to be very efficiently swallowed by their host galaxies .",
    "the lcdm n - body simulations could well be correct about the number of subhalos created , but highly underestimating the rate at which they are destroyed by their hosts .",
    "we have found orbits for 57 galaxies in the local group , including the galaxies of the ngc3109 subgroup , consistent with the time dependent gravitational forces from the mw , m31 , m33 plus galaxies , groups and clusters on scales out to 50 mpc .",
    "concordant proper motions are found for those with precision observed proper motions : m31 , m33 , ic10 , and leoi . from these trajectories ,",
    "possible non - dissipational explanations are beginning to emerge for four large planar structures of local group dwarf galaxies .",
    "near m31 there are two planes of galaxies , both with rms thicknesses of about 13 kpc .",
    "the first plane , described by @xcite , includes m31 and 14 dwarf galaxies .",
    "it extends 600 kpc between the two most separated galaxies .",
    "it would also include the mw , if extended that far .",
    "* plane 2 * includes 9 members and is offset by 100 kpc from m31 .",
    "its maximum extent is 460 kpc . for the mw",
    ", we again see two thin planes , an inner one goes out to about 0.4 mpc ( * plane 4 * ) and * plane3 * goes out to @xmath71 mpc .",
    "both include the mw , within the errors .",
    "* plane3 * has 7 members and is a bit wider than the other planes , 34 kpc , but it is also longer with maximum extent of 1.42 mpc .",
    "* plane4 * has 8 members , is about 12 kpc thick and there are 600 kpc between the two most separated galaxies . the normals to the mw planes differ in sgl value by about @xmath59 , but the sgb values differ by @xmath60 , so the smallest axes are not at all parallel , nevertheless the longest axes of the two distributions are nearly parallel to each other and to the lsc motion of the mw .    in our delineation of the four planes , 41 of the 50 galaxies within 1.1 mpc , including the three major ones , are in these planes and can reasonably be assumed to have been physically related to them since early epochs . of the nine not in planes , ic10 and , at larger distance , and27 are located in * plane1 * , but the proper motion of the former and the redshift of the latter indicate , in the context of our modeling , that they are not physically related to * plane1*.    we found two trajectories for m33 with concordant proper motions and chose one of these for the analysis presented here . after settling on the motions for m31 , m33 and the mw , we used orbit integrations from the present back to z = 4 for the much lighter remaining lg galaxies .",
    "solutions with many tight orbits around a giant galaxy were passed over in favor of simpler ones .",
    "the fact that the satellites lie in planes today provided sufficient guidance to select between multiple solutions in most cases . by looking for commonality in the proper motions of galaxies within a plane , such as motion within the plane in the appropriate frame of rest ,",
    "a best choice out of the few simple solutions was nearly always clear .",
    "nearly all of the dwarf galaxies began , relative to the mw and m31 , in the upper ( + sgz ) part of the sheet of material that forms the wall of the local void .",
    "the dwarf galaxy region was roughly 1 mpc x 400 kpc x 80 kpc in physical coordinates at z=4 , stretching up to 300 kpc trailing m31 and the mw center of masses in its lsc motion .",
    "this may indicate that a lower sgz section of the wall was completely absorbed by m31 and the mw and all remaining dwarfs came from the upper edge of an earlier wall .    for * plane1 *",
    "galaxies , the blueshifted ones and some of the redshifted ones have spent a hubble time in the plane . as they fell toward m31 ,",
    "their distribution was gravitationally compressed and their motions were focused into the direction of motion of m31 which , in the lg frame , is falling directly into the mw .",
    "as m31 is accelerated toward the mw , dwarf galaxies fall toward where it used to be and constantly realign toward where it is ; thus they line up with the same direction of motion as m31 .",
    "other galaxies shifted by about 100 - 200 kpc in the sgz direction by making 1.5 or 2.5 orbits that were compressed into the m31-mw line by the tidal field of the mw and , to a lesser extent , the entire local supercluster .",
    "the * plane2 * galaxies began at about 300 kpc from m31 in the sgx - sgz projection .",
    "we have solutions in which some executed one pass by m31 and some made two .",
    "but , all have , in the last gyr , made a last pass which sent them to negative sgz through points quite near to m31 .",
    "they are all close to their turnaround in their sgz component and this results in a gathering at the sgz location of the plane and a spreading in the other components .",
    "the tidal field of the mw accentuates the spreading in the sgx direction .    the mw s companion galaxy distribution is partly explained by the fact that the z=4 distribution was quite narrow in sgx .",
    "this may have been because the mw sits between m31 and the cena group , and cena was nearly as close as m31 at z @xmath39 1 .",
    "also , the distributions could have resulted from the tidal field : particularly the elongation in sgy could be due to the influence of the virgo cluster , which must have been quite strong at high z.    the procedure used here is guaranteed to produce the present day structures correctly and so one may well ask what was proven . we can not , by our methods , show that such structures are common or expected .",
    "rather , we have shown that there exists solutions within the standard model that have reasonable initial conditions , i.e. a sheet of material coming out of a void that broke up into filaments and then formed the interesting structures of the local group .",
