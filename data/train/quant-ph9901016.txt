    "the experimental value of the energy difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 states for hydrogen atom reads ( in unit of microwave frequency )    @xmath5    while the absolute ls for @xmath6 state is @xcite    @xmath7    @xmath8    the ls only accounts for the order of @xmath9 or @xmath10 of that of the binding energy for electron , i.e. , that of rydberg energy    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the reduced mass of electron and @xmath13 .",
    "( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the theoretical investigation over 50 years reveals that :    \\(a ) the main contribution of ls comes from the difference of radiative correction ( i.e. , the perturbative energy stemming from emitting a virtual photon and then absorbing it ) in different states of electron .",
    "\\(b ) the difference between the wave functions of @xmath15 states and @xmath16 states is important .",
    "the electron in @xmath15 states has more probability to move into the vicinity of nucleus . in other words",
    ", it has more high momentum components in the momentum representation of wave function for @xmath15 states .    in some literature , in the integration of momentum @xmath17 of virtual photon",
    ", the range of @xmath17 was often divided into two regions . for low @xmath17 from @xmath18 to , say , @xmath19 ,",
    "the binding effect of electron is taken into account in noncovariant theory , whereas for high @xmath17 up from @xmath20 the covariant theory of qed is applied .",
    "this kind of treatment seems to us is difficult to avoid the double counting in virtual electron states conceptually .",
    "moreover , the so - called long wave ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) approximation was used in the noncovariant theory at low @xmath17 region as @xmath22 . but @xmath23 ( @xmath24 being the bohr radius ) is also doubtful to be a good approximation .",
    "we wish to restudy the problem in noncovariant scheme .",
    "first of all , the mystery of ls is not only related to the small scale of energy shift shown at eqs.([h2s2p])-([d1s ] ) but also to the high accuracy of the noncovariant calculation based on the stationary schrdinger equation ( sse ) :",
    "@xmath25    with @xmath26 and @xmath27    according to the theory of special relativity ( sr ) , the energy of free electron reads @xmath28 the magnitude ratio of the third term to the second one is approximately @xmath29 in a hydrogenlike atom .",
    "so at first sight , the relativistic modification to @xmath30 would be expected to account for an energy decrease of @xmath31 to order of @xmath32 however , in fact , the ls shows an energy increase of s states to order of @xmath33 only .",
    "this is a mystery we should consider first before the ls could be understood in the noncovariant formalism of qed .",
    "in refs.@xcite-@xcite , it was argued that the sse , eq.([sse ] ) , is essentially relativistic as long as the eigenvalue @xmath34 is related to the binding energy @xmath35 as follows :    @xmath36   \\label{binding}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is the total mass of hydrogenlike atom with @xmath38 being the mass of nucleus .",
    "obviously , when @xmath39 , @xmath40 as expected .",
    "eqs.([sse])-([e ] ) together with eq.([binding ] ) was derived from the time - dependent schrdinger equation of two - body ( say electron - proton ) system in combination with a basic symmetry @xmath41    the explanation is as follows .",
    "the electron and proton are all not pure .",
    "they not only have a particle state @xmath42 , but also have a hiding antiparticle state @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are coupled together according to the symmetry ( [ transition ] ) . for one body system , this symmetry leads to klein - gordon equation ( without spin ) or dirac equation ( with spin ) ( refs.@xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the symmetry that `` the space - time inversion is equivalent to particle - antiparticle transformation '' shown as ( [ transition ] ) is the essence of sr .",
    "the various strange effects of sr are nothing but the reflections of antimatter which is in a subordinate status ( @xmath46 and is just displaying its presence tenaciously@xcite .",
    "therefore , at the level of quantum mechanics , the hamiltonian @xmath30 in sse eq.([sse ] ) is enough in the form of eq.([h0 ] ) .",
    "no @xmath47 term like that in eq.([e ] ) is needed for relativistic correction .",
    "the latter is brought into consideration implicitly at the final stage @xmath48 as shown by eq.([binding ] ) .",
    "based on sse , we consider that in an effective hamiltonian a term @xmath49 will be induced at qed level by radiative correction",
    ". it will lead to an energy shift of hydrogenlike atomic level as :    @xmath50\\frac{b_2z^4}{n^4a^4 } \\hspace{0.5 in } ( a=\\frac 1{\\alpha \\mu } )   \\label{empirical}\\ ] ]    the coefficient @xmath51 can be fixed from experiment by the ls between @xmath2 states in hydrogen :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the small correction stemming from the finite nucleus radius .    to calculate the absolute ls of @xmath54 state , eq.([h1s ] ) , we should add three extra contributions :    \\(a ) the vacuum polarization in qed induces a decrease in charge of electron : @xcite , @xcite @xmath55 which leads to an increase of energy @xmath56 for hydrogen 1s state , it reads @xmath57    \\(b ) the relativistic correction from eq.([binding ] ) reads @xmath58 which yields a decrease in energy : @xmath59    \\(c ) the correction from finite nucleus radius ( @xmath60 ) reads    @xmath61    which contributes a small increase of energy @xmath62 altogether , we obtain theoretically @xmath63 the deviation between ( [ htheory ] ) and the experimental value , eq.([h1s ] ) is only 0.1% .",
    "we are now in a position to derive the value of coefficient @xmath51 from the first principle of qed in noncovariant form .",
    "consider an electron with charge @xmath64 is moving with ( three dimensional ) momentum @xmath65 in the center of mass system of hydrogenlike atom and is coupled to the electromagnetic field via two kinds of interactions ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath66 @xmath67    according to the perturbation theory in quantum mechanics , the energy shift due to ( [ h1 ] ) from original @xmath68 will be @xmath69 where the stationary state @xmath70 is normalized in a volume @xmath71 .",
    "the intermediate ( virtual ) state @xmath72 is composed of a plane wave eigenstate of sse ( eq.([sse ] ) ) @xmath73 and a virtual photon with continuous momentum @xmath74 , see fig .",
    "so the @xmath75 in the denominator of ( [ energyshift1 ] ) reads @xmath76 , ( @xmath77 . the quantized potential @xmath78 of electromagnetic field reads as usual : @xmath79    after the integration of matrix element of @xmath80 with respect to space , we substitute one @xmath81 function @xmath82 by @xmath83 and then perform the integration with respect to @xmath84 , yielding @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "as in the calculation of qed in covariant form , we also encounter the divergent integral @xmath89 , eq.([integration1 ] ) , here in the integration of three dimensional momentum @xmath17 of virtual photon . to treat the divergence , we will follow the spirit of a simple but effective method used in covariant quantum field theory , which evolved from the so - called differential renormalization in the literature @xcite-@xcite , then was proposed by ji - feng yang @xcite and applied extensively in refs.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) . here",
    "the trick is as follows .",
    "take the derivative of integral with respect to the parameter @xmath90 having a mass dimension :    @xmath91    which is convergent now . then we reintegrate eq.([di ] ) with respect to @xmath92 for returning back to @xmath89    @xmath93    where an arbitrary constant @xmath94 appears . substituting ( [ i reintegrate ] ) into ( [ energyshift1integrate ] ) , one obtains @xmath95   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & b_1^{(1)}p^2+b_2^{(1)}p^4+\\cdots   \\label{energyshift1 of p } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath96 @xmath97    note that , however , the term @xmath98 will be combined into the kinetic energy term in original @xmath30 .",
    "they are indistinguishable . the appearance of arbitrary constant @xmath94 precisely reflects the fact that we can not calculate the reduced mass of an electron via the perturbation calculation of @xmath99 .",
    "so the value of @xmath94 is chosen such that @xmath100 , implying that the value of reduced mass @xmath12 ( yet not @xmath101 , see below ) is reconfirmed as an observed mass which can only be fixed by the experiment ( not by theory ) .",
    "next turn to @xmath102 , which induces the spin flip process between @xmath103 and @xmath104 states , yielding @xmath105 @xmath106    for this divergent integral , derivative of third order is needed to render it convergent : @xmath107    so after reintegrating with respect to @xmath108 , we have :    @xmath109    @xmath110-\\frac { 22}{9}(\\frac p\\mu ) ^2-\\frac { 4}{3 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 4\\left ( \\ln2+\\ln\\mu \\right ) -4c_2-\\frac{2c_3}\\mu",

    ". first look at the @xmath117 term which should be combined with the term @xmath118 with @xmath12 already fixed .",
    "any modification on @xmath12 must be finite and fixed .",
    "so the only possible choice of @xmath114 is to cancel the ambiguous term  @xmath119 in @xmath120 , leaving @xmath121    the constants @xmath115 and @xmath116 must be chosen such that @xmath122 which means that we reconfirm the sse as our starting point .",
    "there is always no rest energy term in sse .",
    "hence , the nonzero contribution of @xmath117 does bring a finite and fixed modification on @xmath12 so that @xmath123 where @xmath101 is the reduced mass eventually observed in experiment .",
    "however , as discussed in eq.([e ] ) , there is no term like @xmath124 in sse .",
    "the relativistic correction is left to the modification of @xmath34 to @xmath35 at the final stage .",
    "so an unobservable term is also modified , the difference @xmath125 should be treated also as an unobservable background of modification in @xmath47 term , which should be subtracted off from the observable one . hence while @xmath126 , but instead of @xmath127 , we should have a renormalized @xmath128 as @xmath129",
    "let us use eq.([b2r ] ) to evaluate the ls of h atom : @xmath130 adding the contributions from eqs.([hvp ] ) , ( [ hrel ] ) and ( [ hnu ] ) , we get @xmath131 which is smaller than the experimental value eq.([h1s ] ) up to 0.28% .    for the ls between @xmath3 and @xmath4 states , @xmath132",
    "after adding a small contribution due to the finite nucleus radius , we have @xmath133 which is also smaller than the experimental value eq.([h2s2p ] ) up to 0.40% .    for further improvement , we keep all @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) terms .",
    "so we manage to evaluate the renormalized radiation correction as follows @xmath136 with @xmath137 and @xmath138 as we wish to keep the explicit dependence on @xmath139 throughout eq .",
    "( [ radiativeenergyrenormalizied ] ) being of order @xmath140 .",
    "then we calculate the expectation value of @xmath141 for a fixed state numerically , yielding @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 after adding the other three corrections eqs.([vp])-([nu ] ) , we are pleased to see the results @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 coinciding with the experimental data to a high accuracy ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "\\(a ) we propose a simple but effective method for calculating the ls in a noncovariant form .",
    "two crucial observations are as follows :    \\(i ) the sse is essentially relativistic as long as its eigenvalue @xmath34 is related to the binding energy @xmath35 by eq.([binding ] ) .",
    "( ii)the main contribution to ls is coming from the different mean values of operator @xmath0 in @xmath15 and @xmath16 states as shown in the semiempirical calculation .",
    "the analysis convinced ourselves that the use of three dimensional momentum @xmath65 is much suitable than that of four dimensional one .",
    "actually , a simple one - loop calculation in covariant form of qed gave us the value of ls for h atom with accuracy only 5% for @xmath2 states and even worse ( @xmath151 for @xmath152 state @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) the subtlety of sse can be seen further by the following comparison . at free moving condition , the relativistic effect is contained in the definition @xmath153 with rest ( reduced ) mass being a constant containing all the radiative correction . on the other hand , when the electron is bound in a hydrogenlike atom , its hamilton @xmath30 contains no rest mass and no explicit ( negative ) @xmath0 term either . the relativistic effect is contained in the definition @xmath154 ( with @xmath155 and @xmath156 being the total energy and mass of the system ) and eq.([binding ] ) implicitly",
    "however , the radiative correction does induce a small ( positive ) term of @xmath0 at the level of qed .",
    "\\(c ) the definition of @xmath31 and eq.([binding ] ) also indicate that there is no any negative energy eigenstate in sse . the hiding antiparticle state ( which is the essence of special relativity )",
    "is already taken into account in deriving sse with eq.([binding ] ) .",
    "in other words , no further explicit virtual positron state should be considered in our calculation .",
    "actually , we had struggled for years before eventually realizing that only the simple formulas ( [ energyshift1 ] ) and ( [ energyshift2 ] ) with fig.1 are needed in the perturbative calculation of second order .",
    "\\(d ) the effective hamiltonian of hydrogenlike atom for evaluating the ls can be summarized as @xmath157 while the third term @xmath158 is the qed modification to the first term , the fourth term could be seen as that to the second term ( see eqs.([alpha ] ) , ( [ vp ] ) ) .",
    "eq.([effhamilton ] ) is applicable to @xmath159 states .",
    "the @xmath160 state is pushed up by extra spin - orbit coupling to form the fine structure . for hydrogen ,",
    "@xmath161 about @xmath162 times of ls .",
    "furthermore , the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) in hydrogen , stemming from the interaction between the magnetic moments of electron and proton , is smaller than the ls .",
    "the energy splitting of @xmath6 states is well known as @xmath163 .",
    "as we do nt take the magnetic moment of nuclei into account , the hfs is not considered in this paper .    in deriving the @xmath164 ,",
    "the pauli interaction term @xmath102 between electron spin and the external magnetic field has to be added to the rsse so that the spin - orbital coupling ( hyperfine structure ) and ls can be calculated quantitatively .",
    "this is the price we must pay for the use of rsse . on the other hand , though the dirac equation in external field can predict the electron spin with @xmath165 , it fails to take the difference of reduced mass of electron into account because it is a one - body equation .",
    "furthermore , it predicts a too low ground state ( @xmath54 ) and a too large splitting of @xmath166 and @xmath4 states .",
    "the weakness of dirac equation seems to us is due to its overestimation of the antiparticle ingredient in the electron as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "actually , only after long time study on dirac equation with its difficulty in calculating ls , especially the absolute ls of @xmath54 states , could we believe in the advantage of using rsse as the starting point .",
    "\\(e ) the reasonable result in this paper again shows the correctness and effectiveness of the renormalization method used in refs.@xcite-@xcite . for treating the divergence , which warns us of the lack of our knowledge about the parameters ( mass , charge , etc . ) , the renormalization is a procedure to reconfirm the parameters step by step rigorously .",
    "here it is interesting to see an example of finite and fixed renormalization .",
    "note that , however , we must consider the contribution of @xmath80 first to define the parameter @xmath12 before to consider that of @xmath102 for bringing @xmath12 to @xmath167 .",
    "this is the only reasonable logic . the inverse logic , i.e. , to consider @xmath102 first and then @xmath80 next , would lead to inconsistent and wrong result .",
