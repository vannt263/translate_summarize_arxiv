    "before the discovery of the first extra - solar planet ( mayor & queloz @xcite ) , the constraints on the planetary formation models were confined to the solar system example .",
    "today more than 40 extra - solar planetary systems are known .",
    "these discoveries immediately opened new horizons to this field , but also brought a bunch of new questions and problems .",
    "in fact , the extra - solar planets found to date do nt have much in common with our own solar system .",
    "their physical characteristics were completely unexpected .",
    "some of them , like the extreme proximity of some of the new planets to their `` mother '' stars are surprising and still defy current formation models .",
    "a review of the subject can be found in marcy , cochran & mayor ( @xcite ) .",
    "one particular fact became evident soon after the first extra - solar planets were discovered .",
    "the metallicity of the stars with planets proved to be distinctively different from the one found in field single dwarfs , being very metal - rich ( gonzalez @xcite , @xcite ) . as the number of extra - solar planets is increasing , this fact is becoming more and more sharp .",
    "recent work showed that the high metallicity of the stars with giant planets can not be the result of stellar population effects ( gonzalez @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , gonzalez & laws ( @xcite ) add more evidence for chemical anomalies in stars with planetary companions .",
    "their study suggests that the anomalies not only involve the [ fe / h ] index , but possibly also the ratios [ li / h ] , [ c / h ] and [ n / h ] .",
    "the observed correlations between the presence of planets and the existence of chemical anomalies represent the only known physical connection between their presence and a stellar photospheric parameter , and their study is thus of major importance .",
    "in addition to the discovery of a planet around ( naef et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the geneva extra - solar planet search group recently announced the discovery of 8 new low - mass companions to solar type stars ( all with masses below @xmath115@xmath2 ) .",
    "these new planets and brown - dwarfs are included in a volume - limited sample of dwarfs ( udry et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we present and discuss the abundance analysis of the elements c , o , s , ca , ti , fe , and si in the new candidates , , , , , , and .",
    "planets have also been discovered during the coralie survey around ( queloz et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ( udry et al .",
    "@xcite ) . we also present a spectroscopic analysis of these two stars , already studied by flynn & morell ( @xcite ) , and gonzalez & laws ( @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the other three recently announced candidates ( , and ) will be the subject of a future publication .",
    "the spectra were obtained during three separate runs , between january and april 2000 , using the new 1.2-m euler swiss telescope at la silla ( eso ) , chile , equipped with the coralie echelle spectrograph .",
    "the resolving power ( @xmath3 ) of the spectrograph is about 50000 , and the spectra cover the visible spectrum between 3800 and 6800  without gaps .",
    "the spectra have s / n ratios between about 150 and 350 ( for the faintest objects we doubled the exposures ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present two sample spectra of and .    the reduction of the spectra was carried out using standard tasks in the echelle package of iraf .",
    "the wavelength calibration was done using the spectrum of a thorium - argon lamp that was taken in the beginning of the night .",
    "after wavelength calibrated , the spectra were corrected for the radial - velocity doppler shift using the velocity computed in the context of the planet search programme , and normalized using the continuum task in iraf . in this step",
    "we divided the spectra into 350  wide intervals , that were normalized separately using 3rd order spline functions , and added together at the end .",
    "a visual inspection of the resulting spectra showed that the results were quite satisfactory .",
    "abundance determination was done using a standard local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) analysis with a revised version of the line abundance code moog ( sneden @xcite ) , and a grid of kurucz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) atlas9 atmospheres .",
    "atomic data for iron lines was taken from the list of gonzalez & laws ( @xcite ) .",
    "this choice was done so that our results would be in the same scale with theirs .",
    "since we could not obtain a solar spectrum , we also used the gf - values listed by these authors .",
    "the line - lists for other elements were compiled from different authors , and semi - empirical gf - values were computed using equivalent widths obtained in the high resolution solar atlas ( kurucz et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and a solar model with @xmath4  =  5777k , @xmath5  =  4.438 and @xmath6  =  1kms@xmath7 .",
    "we decided to adopt a value of @xmath8  =  7.47 ( the same used by gonzalez & laws @xcite ) .",
    "for other elements , the values were taken from anders & grevesse ( @xcite ) .",
    "measured equivalent widths for the lines in the observed stars were determined by gaussian fitting using the splot task in iraf . in tables",

    "@xcite ; saar et al .",
    "@xcite ; santos et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and thus more difficult targets for high - precision radial - velocity searches for planets . also , given their masses , a random sample of f dwarfs must be in general younger and thus more metal - rich than an equivalent sample of g dwarfs .",
    "this may explain the fact that stars in this region are slightly above the mean [ fe / h ] in the plot .",
    "given these biases , we will concentrate on the right side of the diagram , plotted in more detail in fig  [ fig5 ] .",
    "this plot gives the impression that some trend exists in the sense of an anti - correlation .",
    "this is due to the presence of a very few stars in the lower - right corner of the diagram .",
    "however , a linear fit to the points shows no significant correlation ( we obtain a spearman correlation coefficient of @xmath130.3 ) .",
    "it is important at this point to discuss the sources of uncertainties in the diagram .",
    "first of all , the mass of the convection zone changes very fast with age in those evolutionary ages . for a 1m@xmath33 star ,",
    "if instead of 10@xmath31 we take 310@xmath31yr , the difference in the mass of the convection zone increases by about 0.3m@xmath33 .",
    "it is possible that disk contamination can happen in slightly different time scales for different stars , and thus the final result would be completely different . furthermore , the contamination scenario itself is not simple . if instead of disk contamination we imagine that one or more planets fell into the star ( by dynamical interactions in a multiple system ) , this would not necessarily take place at the same time in a star s life .",
    "and of course , why should one expect that all stars would be `` polluted '' by the same amount of material ?",
    "these facts may probably explain , or at least contribute , to the observed dispersion .",
    "adding to these errors , the precision of eqn .",
    "[ eqn1 ] is difficult to establish , but errors of the order of 0.2 to 0.3 dex are expected .",
    "the errors in the age are also not measurable , but might amount to some gyr . to these",
    "we must add the uncertainties in the stellar models .",
    "on the other hand , the analysis of the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] poses another problem : how can we explain that `` contamination '' effects may have increased the [ fe / h ] by more than 0.6  dex in stars with convection envelopes having masses around 0.35  @xmath35 ?",
    "for example , the fall of 10 earth masses of iron into a star with a convective envelope having solar metallicity and a mass of 0.3  @xmath35 would increase the [ fe / h ] by an insignificant amount . if the abundances are really due to some enrichment process , then they must probably have taken place much after 10@xmath31  yr . if the disk time - scales are correct , this would imply that the process did not involve the fall of disk material , but the addition of formed planets .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we have thus made a plot of the same variables , but this time @xmath26 was computed for an age of 10@xmath32 yr .",
    "still no correlation is evident .",
    "although the size of the convection envelope has dropped , it seems unlikely that the high values observed for the [ fe / h ] excess can be explained in an enrichment scenario ( due to the fall of one or multiple planets ) .",
    "the convective outer envelope of the sun at an age of 10@xmath32  yr represents about 3% of the total mass , and the fall of the same quantity of iron would change the abundance by about @xmath10.15  dex",
    ". this value would drop if we take a giant gaseous planet , containing a certain amount of h and he . to have an excess of [ fe / h ] of the order of 0.6  dex we have to imagine that a star like the sun had to swallow about 30 earth masses of iron . considering the composition of c1 chondrites",
    ", this would mean @xmath15 times more in silicate material , a value that seems excessively high . unless multiple silicate - rich giant planets fell into the star",
    ", this result clearly supports the idea that the cause of the excess of iron is probably `` primordial '' .",
    "since the high [ fe / h ] vs. existence of planet relation is not in cause , these arguments favor a scenario where the formation of giant planets is dependent on the metallicity of the parent cloud .",
    "we have presented an abundance analysis of 7 stars known to harbor giant planets and one with a brown dwarf candidate .",
    "the results obtained further support the idea that stars with planets are metal rich when compared with field dwarfs .",
    "we discuss two possible scenarios that could explain the observed anomalies .",
    "the results are still not conclusive , but support the idea that a star needs to be formed out of a metal - rich cloud to form giant planets .",
    "one other important conclusion comes out of the present work : to be able to search and study hypothetical chemical anomalies in elements other than iron one must lower the errors in the abundance determination to at least 0.1  dex .",
    "this should be possible in the context of a high resolution and s / n spectroscopic study , using for all objects the same spectral lines , atmosphere models , and if possible making use of a comparison set of stars without planetary companions and with similar atmospheric parameters .",
