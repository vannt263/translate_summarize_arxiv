    "several arguments based on present metallicity of the interstellar medium , rate of supernovae and on properties of the observed radio pulsar population indicate that of the order of 10@xmath5 to 10@xmath6 old isolated neutron star ( ins ) should exist in the galaxy .",
    "ostriker , rees & silk ( @xcite ) were the first to propose that a sizeable fraction of these old and radio - quiet neutron stars could be heated by accretion from interstellar medium and be again detectable by their far - uv and soft x - ray emission .",
    "early modelling of this population by treves & colpi ( @xcite ) and madau & blaes ( @xcite ) led to the conclusion that re - heated old neutron stars should indeed appear in large numbers in soft and uv all - sky surveys with a possible concentration in the directions of highest interstellar medium densities , namely the galactic plane in general and more specifically molecular clouds",
    ".    boosted by these predictions several optical identification campaigns of rosat x - ray and uv sources were initiated and it readily became clear that the number of possible isolated neutron star candidates was substantially below average model predictions ( e.g. , manning et al .",
    "@xcite , motch et al .",
    "@xcite , danner @xcite ) .",
    "however , four good isolated neutron star candidates were discovered so far in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "these candidates share as common properties a soft x - ray spectrum with black body temperatures below 100ev , no radio emission detected and very high f@xmath7/f@xmath8ratio in excess of 10@xmath9 .",
    "the x - ray brightest of these candidates are which was optically identified with a v=25.6 blue object ( walter et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the pulsating source  ( haberl et al .",
    "@xcite ) which has no counterpart brighter than b=26.1 ( motch & haberl @xcite , kulkarni & van kerkwijk @xcite ) .",
    "other good cases are rxj0806.44123 ( haberl et al .",
    "@xcite ) and 1rxs j130848.6 + 212708 ( schwope et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the mean time",
    ", the possibility that a fraction of these candidates could rather be young neutron stars has gained considerable credit .",
    "the lack of detectable radio emission from these sources could be explained by a b , p@xmath10 position behind the radio pulsar death line or more simply by beaming effects which are stronger at long spin periods ( wang et al .",
    "finally , rxte observations have demonstrated that soft @xmath11-ray repeaters are newly born neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "@xcite ) and belong to the population of magnetars proposed by duncan & thomson ( @xcite ) . as radio emission can be quenched by the strong magnetic field , these objects may remain undetected by classical radio means and their birth rate could amount to 10% of that of ordinary pulsars ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "since the primary store of energy in a magnetar is that in the magnetic field , b decay could constitute a significant source of heat , allowing magnetars to remain detectable in x - rays over longer times than ordinary pulsars ( heyl & kulkarni @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , several of the ins found so far could be young neutron stars , perhaps descendant of soft @xmath11-ray repeaters , rather than old accreting ins as originally thought .",
    "detailed study of the few known ins and determination of their x - ray powering mechanism is therefore of high importance .    in this paper , we report on x - ray and optical observations of one of the x - ray brightest isolated neutron star candidates .",
    "the source , also known as rbs 1556 ( schwope et al .",
    "@xcite ) , was extracted from the rosat all - sky survey on the basis of its soft spectrum and lack of bright optical and radio counterpart .",
    "thanks to its soft sensitivity well suited to the detection of sources with @xmath12= 20 - 100 ev , as expected from young cooling neutron stars or from old ones re - heated by accretion , the rosat all - sky survey offers a highly valuable database for detecting these elusive objects . in order to find candidates , we selected rosat all - sky survey sources displaying hr1 and hr2 hardness ratios compatible with intrinsically soft spectra slightly modified by a reasonable amount of interstellar absorption .",
    "hardness ratios 1 and 2 are defined as @xmath13 @xmath14 where ( a - b ) is the raw background corrected source count rate in the a@xmath15b energy range expressed in kev . based on simulations of black body energy distributions folded with the rosat pspc response we decided to extract all - sky survey sources having hardness ratios",
    "compatible ( i.e. within one standard error value ) with hr1 @xmath16 -0.25 and hr2 @xmath16 -0.5 .",
    "this parameter space corresponds to @xmath12  @xmath16 100 ev and n@xmath1  @xmath16 4@xmath210@xmath17 to 3@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 for @xmath12  = 40ev and @xmath12  = 100ev respectively .",
    "our observational strategy was then to identify all sources in large sky areas down to the faintest x - ray flux level possible in order to find new candidates and also efficiently constrain the space density of these objects . results from this global study will be presented in a later paper .",
    "the possible ins nature of  =  was discovered while identifying the northern sample .",

    "the first observation was carried out during the 1998 pspc revival period from 1998 february 18 till 22 for a total exposure time of 4413s .",
    "the second observation was performed with the hri from 1998 march 2 to 4 and lasted 19307s .",
    "the source was detected on both occasions .      the time averaged pspc spectrum is well represented by a blackbody energy distribution with best fit parameters of @xmath12  = 92ev and n@xmath1  = 1.1 10@xmath3@xmath4 ( @xmath18 = 50.9 ) . at the 95% confidence level , the allowed range is @xmath12  = 86 - 98ev and n@xmath1  = 0.6 - 1.5 10@xmath3@xmath4 .",

    "object c is the only one detected in the small attitude corrected hri error circle , special attention was given to its analysis .",
    "being about 0.7 mag fainter than star b the spectral features of c are obviously less recognizable .",

    "[ cm ] the flux calibrated spectrum of c together with that of a template m0v star extracted from the spectral atlas of jacobi hunter and christian ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nad line and the broad tio molecular bands visible in the smoothed m0v spectrum can be also seen in object c. the similarity of the energy distributions is also striking and the r - i and b - r colour indexes of c are also consistent with a @xmath26 m2v star .",
    "all these evidences support the conclusion that c is a rather early m type star .    finally , based on ca break , h@xmath27  and nad line positions , the spectrum of object d ( fig . [ ad ] ) suggests an identification with a galaxy at @xmath28 @xmath26 0.3 .",
    "the position of object c in the attitude corrected hri error circle is somewhat puzzling but may not be fully significant . at @xmath29",
    "= 53 , @xmath30 = 48 , the surface density of stars brighter than r = 23.5 is 12,300deg@xmath31 ( robin & crz @xcite ) .",
    "there is therefore more than 1% probability that a star falls by chance in the 2radius error circle .",
    "the photometric distance to the m2v star is @xmath26 7kpc .",
    "if the x - ray source were physically associated with the star , its radius would be @xmath24 @xmath26 80 km , i.e. too large for a neutron star and too small for a white dwarf",
    ". the emitting area could be compatible with a polar cap heated by accretion as seen in am her systems in which case , our optical observations could have been obtained during a low state .",
    "this explanation can not be strictly ruled out , as the white dwarf could be cool enough in the low state ( @xmath32@xmath16 20,000k ) to remain undetected at b = 25.85 which is the b magnitude of object c. we also do not have enough spectral resolution to detect the emission lines which could reveal heating of the late m star by the white dwarf .",
    "however , the absence of x - ray and optical variability and the unusually hot temperature of compared to those of black body components in polars make this possibility rather unlikely .",
    "a hot white dwarf would have to be located at unrealisticly large distances ( @xmath21 @xmath26 270kpc ) , although this distance may be overestimated by the black body fit .",
    "the black body temperature is also hot compared to that observed from the hottest known pg 1159 stars ( e.g. werner et al .",
    "@xcite ) . finally ,",
    "if the high temperature of the white dwarf were due to nuclear burning at its surface , we would detect the heated accretion disc and mass donor star or the surrounding nebula such as in smc n67 .    in general ,",
    "all classes of soft emitters else than neutron stars are difficult to reconcile with the observational picture . taking the expected v magnitude of the m2v star ( v = 24.24 ) as an upper limit to the optical emission from the rosat source implies f@xmath7/f@xmath8  @xmath33 10@xmath9 . comparing with the f@xmath7/f@xmath8  distribution of bright rosat all - sky survey sources identified in simbad ( e.g. motch et al .",
    "@xcite ) shows that all galactic or extragalactic classes of sources other than isolated neutron stars are probably ruled out ( see also fig . 3 in schwope et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the source is optically too faint to be identified with even extreme cases of cataclysmic variables or agn .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the hri attitude correction since none of the other optical candidates studied in the large rosat survey error circle is a likely counterpart of the x - ray source .",
    "in particular , the extragalactic objects lack the broad emission lines usually seen in soft agn ( e.g. greiner et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    assuming a neutron star radius of 10 km implies a source distance of 900pc for full surface emission .",
    "however , this distance estimate is very sensitive to the actual energy distribution in the rosat band .",
    "for instance , rajagopal and romani ( @xcite ) have shown that blackbody fits to neutron star model atmospheres folded through the rosat pspc tend to overestimate the effective temperature by a factor of up to 3 depending on chemical composition . applying the maximum correction could bring the source to much closer distances ( @xmath21 @xmath26 100pc ) .",
    "the total galactic n@xmath1  in the direction of  is 2.47 10@xmath3@xmath4 ( dickey , j. & lockman , @xcite ) about twice that derived from the blackbody fits to pspc data ( see fig .",
    "[ bbgrid ] )",
    ". however , this difference may not be significant since similar to the effective temperature , the estimated photelectric absorption sensitively depends upon the assumed soft x - ray energy distribution .    we conclude that  exhibits all the features , soft thermal - like spectrum , high f@xmath7/f@xmath8 , expected from an isolated neutron star .",
    "as for , the average particle density available for accretion in the vicinity of the neutron star is probably small .",
    "iras maps do not reveal any particular density enhancement in the direction of . using the mean particle density versus scale height law of dickey & lockman ( @xcite )",
    "yields average densities of only 0.3@xmath34 at 100pc and 0.06@xmath34 at 300pc . in order to explain the x - ray luminosity of the source by bondi hoyle accretion ,",
    "very low values of the total relative plus sound speed velocities must be achieved , 12 km s@xmath23  and 3.5 km s@xmath23  for @xmath21 = 100 and 300pc respectively . in particular ,",
    "large distances of the order of 900pc as suggested by pspc spectral fitting seem incompatible with the accretion model .",
    "however , this major difficulty could be bypassed assuming the presence of a local overdensity or if the blackbody modelling strongly overestimates the total accretion luminosity .",
    "so far , three isolated neutron star candidates have been detected in the galactic plane ( @xmath35  ( haberl et al .",
    "@xcite ) and only two  and 1rxs j130848.6 + 212708 ( schwope et al .",
    "@xcite ) above the plane .  is the x - ray brightest high galactic latitude candidate .",
    "the steep decrease of particle density with distance for  could allow to sensitively test the mechanism leading to x - ray emission in this newly discovered class of objects .",
    "the strongest argument in favour of a young cooling neutron star is probably the stability of x - ray emission over long time scales .",
    "this property of is also shared by  and .",
    "neutron stars accreting in binaries always exhibit some kind of variability on a large range of time scales from seconds to months .",
    "although the accretion conditions prevailing in binaries are usually far from those assumed for accretion from interstellar medium , it is still puzzling that none of the members of this new class so far studied in details shows convincing evidences for variability .    for normal pulsars",
    ", the blackbody temperature of 1.1 10@xmath36k implies cooling ages in the range of 2@xmath2 10@xmath9 to 10@xmath37yr depending on the presence of accreted material at the surface of the neutron star ( chabrier et al .",
    "@xcite ) . considering the probable overestimation of @xmath32  by the blackbody fit ,",
    "ages of up to 10@xmath36yr are still possible .",
    "and its cousins  and  have in common two properties which are never encountered together in other classes of neutron stars , i ) absence of strong radio emission and ii ) absence of luminous hard x - ray tail above the thermal spectrum .",
    "these features could be used to define the new class of objects .",
    "simultaneous absence of radio and hard x - ray emission is understandable in the framework of old accreting neutron stars .",
    "the low magnetic field or the long spin period necessary for accretion to take place are likely to put the pulsar beyond the death line , in the graveyard , and the emitted x - ray spectrum is expected to resemble that of a soft black body for a large range of parameters ( zampieri et al .",
    "we envisage below the implications of such properties for young cooling ins .",
    "the most simple explanation for the absence of radio emission is that the radio beam does not cross the earth .",
    "the beaming fraction which is the proportion of the sky swept by the radio beam decreases with increasing spin period ( biggs @xcite ) and is of the order of 0.2 for the overall pulsar population ( e.g. lyne et al .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore",
    ", radio detection means may miss a large fraction of the pulsar population among which a part may be hot enough to be detected in soft x - rays .",
    "as noted by kulkarni & van kerkwijk ( @xcite ) , this explanation can not hold for the pulsating source  because the time needed to brake the neutron star to the long spin period of 8.39s ( assuming a magnetic field of 10@xmath38 g ) is much larger than the cooling time .",
    "for the same reason , the absence of radio emission from  is unlikely to be due to a position beyond the death line as this would also imply rather long spin periods incompatible with the hot emission .",
    "another possibility is that  is a magnetar with a dipolar surface field b larger than about 4@xmath210@xmath39 g in which case radio emission may be quenched ( heyl & kulkarni @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the x - ray spectrum is to the accuracy of the measurements thermal - like suggests a much reduced magnetospheric activity compared to other known neutron stars .    among the 27 pulsars detected in x - rays and listed in becker & trmper ( @xcite ) , only three middle aged pulsars ( geminga ,",
    "psr b0656 + 14 and psr b1055 - 52 ) have in addition to a power law a recognizable black body component in their soft x - ray energy distribution .",
    "an interesting case is psr b0656 + 14 , a radio emitting pulsar about @xmath26 10@xmath37yr old with a magnetic field of 4.7@xmath210@xmath38 g and located at a distance of 760pc .",
    "psr b0656 + 14 exhibits a rosat pspc spectrum ( @xmath12  = 80 - 90 ev ; possenti et al .",
    "@xcite ) strikingly similar to that of .",
    "the additional faint hard component needed to fit the spectrum of psr b0656 + 14 would not have been detected in  because of the lower statistics .",
    "neutron stars born with magnetic field b @xmath33 10@xmath40 g , the magnetars , are thought to be powerful soft x - ray emitters because magnetic field decay provides an additional source of heat ( thompson & duncan @xcite , heyl & kulkarni @xcite ) .",
    "the young magnetars associated with soft @xmath11-ray repeaters such as sgr 1806 - 20 or sgr 1900 + 14 exhibit powerlaw - like quiescent x - ray spectra without evidences for black body components .",
    "these non - thermal energy distributions could be the signature of a compact synchrotron nebula ( marsden et al .",
    "it has been proposed that the class of anomalous braking x - ray pulsars could be related to magnetars ( e.g. thompson & duncan @xcite ) and could constitute a later , less active soft @xmath11-ray repeater phase . in general ,",
    "anomalous x - ray pulsars have again powerlaw - like spectra with in two cases possible blackbody components ( see thompson & duncan @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "pulsating sources like  could represent an even later stage of magnetar evolution with remaining very high magnetic field ( b @xmath26 10@xmath40 g , heyl & hernquist @xcite ) and perhaps still the possibility to emit powerful @xmath11-ray bursts on occasion . because of the additional energy source a magnetar could reach the temperature of 1.1 10@xmath36k after 10@xmath36yr ( heyl & hernquist @xcite ) .",
    "it is however unclear whether the absence of a strong non - thermal component in the x - ray spectrum is compatible with the remaining high magnetic field .",
    "taking into account the unfortunate possibility of a chance alignement between the neutron star and object c implies a b magnitude fainter than @xmath26 26 for .",
    "because of the relatively high temperature , the extrapolation of the black body seen in soft x - rays to the optical regime would imply extremely faint optical magnitudes close to v = 30 .",
    "however , all neutron stars observed so far display optical continuum above the rayleigh - jeans tail of the soft x - ray thermal component .",
    "this is not unexpected since black body fits tend to overestimate @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , a non thermal optical component has been detected in at least two cases , geminga and psr b0656 + 14 . scaling the optical flux with the pspc count rate of  and  and neglecting any temperature effects",
    "yields v@xmath2627.2 for . on the other hand ,",
    "if  is similar to geminga or psr b0656 + 14 its b magnitude could be as bright as our limit of 26 .",
    "therefore the source may well be bright enough to be optically identified with current means and optical imaging could allow the detection of proper motion which is a crucial test for determining the x - ray powering mechanism .",
    "the only optical object detected in the small hri error circle is a late m star most probably unrelated to the x - ray source .",
    "altogether , x - ray and optical observations of  strongly suggest that the soft x - ray source is due to thermal emission from a nearby isolated neutron star . however , based on the presently available data , it is not possible to distinguish between accretion from the interstellar medium or cooling as the main x - ray emitting mechanism .    the constancy of the x - ray flux on various time scales and the difficulties encountered by the accretion model as a result of the small mean ambient densities are arguments , although not fully compelling , for a cooling neutron star .",
    "the undetermined neutron star spin period and the lack of sensitive measurement of a hard x - ray component prevent us from drawing any firm conclusion on the nature of the source .",
    "one possibility is that  is a twin of psr b0656 + 14 but that the radio beam does not intercept the earth . alternatively ,  could be a magnetar , maybe similar to .",
