    "in recent years the field of galaxy cluster surveys has been re - energised by the realisation that a well - measured cluster population places strong independent constraints on cosmological models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the largest known bound objects , clusters can be used to simultaneously probe the cosmic expansion rate and the gravitational mechanisms responsible for the growth of structure in the universe .",
    "the evolution of the galaxy cluster mass function across cosmological times and the distribution of clusters within the tridimensional large - scale structure are two key observables , since they are readily predicted by theoretical models and simulations .",
    "galaxy cluster cosmology studies start with constructing cluster samples .",
    "fortunately for observers , the hot baryonic gas trapped in galaxy clusters emits large amounts of x - ray photons , in great part due to bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "extended x - ray objects are thus the signpost of deep potential wells , and their x - ray luminosity directly relates to the mass of the dark matter halo in which they reside .",
    "therefore , large surveys of the sky at the high - energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum ( i.e.  x - ray ) permit a complete census of clusters covering a wide range of masses and redshifts , and survey data themselves can provide estimates of the mass of these objects .",
    "this is why large surveys in the x - ray wavelengths aimed at constraining cosmology with galaxy clusters have been developed since the early years of x - ray astronomy @xcite , with a notable step - change brought about by the rosat all - sky survey @xcite and rosat serendipitous surveys @xcite and the support of chandra and xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "the next major advance in the field will be offered by _ erosita _ ( extended roentgen survey with an imaging telescope array , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which will survey the entire sky in the 0.3 - 10  kev energy range at depths 10 to 30 times deeper than rosat .",
    "the combination of erosita s field of view , angular resolution and sensitivity will lead to the detection of @xmath8 galaxy clusters down to @xmath9 $ ]  kev fluxes of @xmath10  ergss@xmath11 @xmath12 and up to redshifts of unity and beyond ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , x - ray observations alone , in general , are not sufficient to fully assess the nature of the emitting sources and , most importantly , to determine their redshifts .",
    "therefore , optical observations play a critical role in complementing surveys of galaxy clusters in x - rays . whilst multi - filter optical imaging proves efficient at detecting and characterizing galaxy clusters  notably through their ubiquitous red sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  , ultimate confirmation of a galaxy cluster is achieved by optical spectroscopy .",
    "spectroscopic observations of cluster members can be used to disentangle projection effects and substructures from real concentrations , and they also provide the precise redshift of the halo , and therefore lead to precise luminosities and masses once they are combined with x - ray measurements . obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for galaxy cluster members is recognized as a major bottleneck in x - ray cluster surveys , because of the double need for deep imaging data to select targets , and the deep spectroscopic exposures necessary for redshift determination .",
    "the spiders ( spectroscopic identification of _ erosita _ sources ) cluster program is specifically designed to overcome this bottleneck .",
    "it relies on the boss spectrograph mounted on the sdss-2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory @xcite to follow - up galaxies detected in the large area of extragalactic sky imaged in @xmath13 filters by the same telescope .",
    "the sdss / boss instrumentation and infrastructure are used in combination with most recent techniques in finding x - ray galaxy clusters and their photometric members , in order to perform an unprecedentedly wide spectroscopic survey of x - ray galaxy clusters .",
    "advanced techniques used in this work include the wavelet filtering of x - ray maps , and the use of a series of matched filters to look for red - sequence galaxies in a multi - variate optical parameter space ( colour , position and magnitude ) .",
    "this paper ( one of a series of sdss - iv technical papers ) , describes the targeting and analysis steps leading to the construction of a large , spectroscopically validated sample of x - ray selected galaxy clusters within spiders . in the preparation phase for _ erosita _ , these samples are drawn from rosat and xmm data . throughout this paper",
    "we use a small pilot survey dubbed sequels ( sloan extended quasar , elg , and lrg survey , a precursor to the main spiders / eboss / tdss program ) to illustrate the efficacy of our targeting and analysis approach .",
    "we present the first scientific results from the spiders cluster program .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sect : spiders ] is devoted to the general presentation of the spiders cluster survey and the samples of x - ray clusters it is based upon .",

    "spiders is an observational program , part of the sdss - iv project @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of spiders is to obtain homogeneous and complete spectroscopic follow - up of extragalactic sources , both point - like and extended , using data from x - ray satellites and over the sdss imaging footprint . given the nature of these sources , spiders naturally splits into two main components , i.e.  an agn program and a cluster program .",

    "is presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper describes the targeting of x - ray extended sources identified as galaxy cluster candidates .",
    "the driving goals of the program are the confirmation of those candidates and the assignment of a precise redshift .",
    "this in turn leads to the determination of precise absolute cluster parameters ( including x - ray luminosity and mass ) .",
    "a number of important secondary goals include the estimation of cluster dynamical masses ( via line - of - sight velocity dispersion measurements ) , the study of the physical interplay between massive dark matter halos , the hot baryonic gas they host , and the galaxies that live therein . from a technical point of view",
    ", the spiders cluster program represents a novel approach to galaxy cluster spectroscopic follow - up : the large data volume involved ( several thousands of galaxy clusters ) demands innovative targeting and analysis strategies . considering that the ultimate goal envisaged by the program is precision cosmology using galaxy clusters as tracers of the large - scale structure",
    ", we require that all the procedures involved must undergo careful control and validation .",
    "spiders will follow - up x - ray extended sources detected in _ erosita _",

    "prior to _ erosita _",
    "s launch , galaxy clusters identified in the shallower rass and sparser xmm - newton data will constitute the bulk of the spiders program .",
    "there will be an incremental increase in x - ray sensitivity brought about by each of _ erosita _ s sky surveys , which will start to be be accumulated after the start of sdss - iv .",
    "therefore , spiders is planned in three tiers .",
    "tier  0 , the shallowest tier , relies mainly on rosat data . when successive _ erosita _ catalogues become available ( following the cadence of one deeper x - ray catalogue every six months , going from erass:1 to erass:8 ) , sources in the north galactic cap within the german _ erosita _ sky ( @xmath22 ) will be added to the pool of targets .",
    "the planned launch date of _ erosita _ means that tier  1 and tier  2 will most likely correspond to erass depths 2 and 4 respectively .",
    "[ fig : layout ]  shows the layout of the surveys in equatorial coordinates .",
    "the area covered in tier  0 corresponds to the entire eboss footprint not covered in tiers  1 and 2 , i.e.  @xmath23 , while tier  1 and 2 will lie to the south of the erosita - de boundary ( the black dashed curve in this figure ) , with exact footprints dependent on the launch date .",

    "[ fig : rass_sensitivity ] ) are created as by - products and help in assessing the completeness of the sample .",
    "on average , the 90% completeness level is achieved for a source delivering 8 x - ray counts , while the 10% completeness level is reached for sources delivering 4 counts . given these sensitivity estimates , the number of spurious sources is estimated between 500 and 1000 across the entire codex area and the number of x - ray agn amounts to around 20000 . the redmapper algorithm @xcite looks in sdss imaging data ( data release 8) for galaxies with similar colours around each faint rass source ,",
    "i.e.  for a red - sequence formed by passive galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "this provides in turn an estimate for the photometric redshift of the cluster ( based on the colours of the galaxies ) and an optimized richness estimator .",
    "the counterpart having the highest richness is listed for each rass x - ray source .",
