    "the single - flavour quark condensate @xmath10is a fundamental parameter of @xmath9 , determining the relative size of mass and momentum terms in the expansion .",
    "since it can not be predicted theoretically , its value must be determined experimentally , e.g.  by measuring the @xmath6scattering lengths , whose values are predicted very precisely within the framework of @xmath9 , assuming a big quark condensate @xcite , or of generalised @xmath9 , where the quark condensate is a free parameter @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1decay is a very clean environment for the measurement of @xmath6scattering lengths , since the two pions are the only hadrons and they are produced close to threshold .",
    "the only theoretical uncertainty enters through the constraint @xcite between the scattering lengths @xmath8and @xmath7 . in the @xmath4decay a cusp - like structure",
    "can be observed at @xmath11 , due to re - scattering from @xmath12 .",
    "the scattering lengths can be extracted from a fit of the @xmath5distribution around the discontinuity .",
    "simultaneous @xmath13 and @xmath14 beams were produced by 400 gev energy protons from the cern sps , impinging on a beryllium target .",
    "the kaons were deflected in a front - end achromat in order to select the momentum band of @xmath15 gev/@xmath16 and focused at the beginning of the detector , about 200 m downstream .",
    "for the measurements presented here , the most important detector components are the magnet spectrometer , consisting of two drift chambers before and two after a dipole magnet and the quasi - homogeneous liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the momentum of the charged particles and the energy of the photons are measured with a relative uncertainty of 1% at 20 gev .",
    "a detailed description of the na48/2 detector can be found in ref .",
    "analysing part of the 2003 data , @xmath17 @xmath1events were selected with a background contamination of 0.5% .",
    "the background level was estimated from data , using the so - called `` wrong sign '' events , i.e.  with the signature @xmath18 , that , at the present statistical level , can only be background , since the corresponding kaon decay violates the @xmath19 rule and is therefore strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "the main background contributions are due to @xmath12events with @xmath20 or a pion mis - identified as an electron .",
    "the background estimate from data was cross - checked using monte carlo simulation ( mc ) .",
    "the form factors of the @xmath1decay are parametrised as a function of five kinematic variables @xcite ( see fig .",

    "the following parametrisation was used to determine the form factors from the experimental data @xcite : @xmath32 in a first step , ten independent five - parameter fits were performed for each bin in @xmath21 , comparing data and mc in four - dimensional histograms in @xmath22 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath25 , with 1500 equal population bins each .",

    "the following preliminary result was obtained :    @xmath36    where the systematic uncertainty was determined by comparing two independent analyses and taking into account the effect of reconstruction method , acceptance , fit method , uncertainty on background estimate , electron - id efficiency , radiative corrections and bias due to the neglected @xmath22 dependence .",
    "the form factors are measured relative to @xmath37 , which is related to the decay rate .",
    "the obtained value for @xmath7is compatible with the @xmath9 prediction @xmath38 @xcite and with previous measurements @xcite .",
    "about 10,000 @xmath3events were selected from the 2003 data and about 30,000 from the 2004 data with a background contamination of 3% and 2% , respectively .",
    "the background level was estimated from data by reversing some of the selection criteria and was found to be mainly due to @xmath4events with a pion mis - identified as an electron ( see fig .",
