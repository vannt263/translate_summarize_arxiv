    "realistic potentials which describe quantum mechanical systems , are not usually exactly solvable in the schrdinger picture , except for a few occasions such as harmonic oscillator , coulomb potential , etc .",
    "therefore , finding exact analytical solution of schrdinger equation for a given potential corresponding to a physical system of interest , constitutes one of the major challenges in quantum mechanics .",
    "this is a common problem , and often encountered in almost every branches , such as atomic , molecular , solid - state , nuclear , particle and plasma physics , etc .",
    "a large number of attractive promising approximate formalisms have been developed ever since the inception of theory , which can provide highly accurate or _ near - exact _ results in some cases .",
    "however , the same for a _ general _ potential for _ any _ allowed values of quantum numbers , for _ arbitrary _ values of potential parameters ( if present in the system ) still remains elusive , and thus always has been an active area of research .",
    "here we are concerned with the accurate bound states of two central singular potentials , namely ( i ) the generalized exponential cosine screened coulomb potential , given by , @xmath4 and ( ii ) a much less frequently studied , general exponential screened coulomb ( gesc ) potential of the form , @xmath5.\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath6 represents the coupling strength constant while @xmath7 are two screening parameters .",
    "this potential reduces to the familiar yukawa potential for @xmath8 , which has wide applications in nuclear , solid - state and plasma physics . for @xmath9 ,",
    "this is termed as the exponential cosine screened coulomb ( ecsc ) potential , and it is in this form that this potential has been studied maximum",
    ". one distinctive feature of this oscillating potential ( in contrast to the coulomb potential ) is the _",
    "finite _ number of bound states , i.e. , such states exist only for certain values of the screening parameter below a threshold limit ( the so - called critical @xmath10 ) .",
    "in other words , the total number of different energy levels is finite for a given value of @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the two potential parameters @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) signify coupling strength and screening parameters respectively . throughout the whole article ,",
    "@xmath13 is fixed at unity .",
    "these two potentials can be used to represent the effective interaction in many - electron atoms ; also they have important applications in solid - state , nuclear and plasma physics as well as in field theory @xcite . lately",
    ", the effect of screening on atomic photoionization in h and he@xmath14 has been studied by means of yukawa and ecsc potential @xcite . also , the ground and excited resonances in two - electron systems such as he , molecular h@xmath15 in ecsc as well as generalized screened potential",
    "have been investigated @xcite .",
    "none of these potentials admits exact analytical result .",
    "therefore , over five decades , a considerably large number of attempts have been made to calculate their eigen spectra accurately .",
    "here we mention a few of them .",
    "perturbation and variational methods were used @xcite to produce eigenvalues with reasonable accuracy , as well as the number of bound states for a given value of @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 states were reported @xcite via the representation of ecsc potential by a hulthn potential with an energy - dependent strength parameter , through the use of an ecker - weizel approximation .",
    "the @xmath18 states have been calculated by means of a hyper - virial pad approximation @xcite , dynamical group approach @xcite , hyper - virial equation with hellman - feynman theorem @xcite , etc . using a numerical method @xcite , all the 36 states below @xmath1 , as well as",
    "the critical screening parameters were obtained within an accuracy of eight to six significant figures .",
    "analytical expressions for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of ground and first excited states , up to 14 terms , were presented by a large-@xmath19 expansion method @xcite .",
    "eigenvalues of @xmath20 to @xmath21 states have been reported by means of a shifted @xmath22 expansion technique @xcite .",
    "an iterative solution for eigenvalues belonging to arbitrary @xmath23 quantum numbers has been put forth by employing an asymptotic iteration method @xcite . a novel perturbation method",
    "@xcite has also been proposed for this potential where the radial schrdinger equation is decomposed into two parts , one of them being exactly solvable while the other part leading to closed analytical solution or an approximate treatment depending on the potential in question . lately , a j - matrix approach @xcite with a gaussian quadrature scheme has offered high - quality results for bound and continuum states . a ritz variation method with hydrogenic wave function as the trial function @xcite has also produced promising results for such potential .",
    "recently , an analytical scheme @xcite inspired by the j - matrix method , has been quite successful for such potentials .",
    "the @xmath10 values have been estimated by numerical @xcite , as well as analytical methods @xcite .",
    "the gesc potential , on the other hand , has not received much attention .",
    "i am aware of only two studies .",
    "energy eigenvalues of ground and first excited states were presented up to 14 terms using a large-@xmath19 expansion method @xcite . in another attempt @xcite ,",
    "the perturbative method of @xcite was used to obtain the @xmath24 states of this potential with decent accuracy .    in this work ,",
    "we study the eigenspectra of both these potentials in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) using a generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) method , which has been quite successful for a variety of systems such as the spiked harmonic oscillator , hulthn and yukawa potentials , power - law and logarithmic potentials , ground and excited states ( low- and high - lying rydberg states ) of atoms as well as other singular systems @xcite .",
    "potential parameters are scanned over a large domain . in few occasions , for some of the methodologies mentioned above for ecsc potential , it so happens that , eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are quite difficult to calculate for high - lying states and also at certain region of the potential parameter , especially near the @xmath10 .",
    "here we pay special attention to both these issues for a better understanding of their spectra and also to judge the validity and efficacy of the method . to this end ,",
    "accurate energies and wave functions are presented for all the 55 levels belonging to @xmath25 states of ecsc potential to extend the domain of applicability of the gps procedure .",
    "variation of the same with respect to @xmath16 are also monitored . for the gesc potential ,",
    "only some low - lying @xmath26 states have been considered so far in the literature ; no results are available for @xmath3 states .",
    "so here , we report all the states up to @xmath27 for a wide range of parameters in the potential for the first time , and some higher states as well .",
    "a detailed comparison with the available results in the literature has been made , wherever possible .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "an outline of the theory and method of calculation is presented in section ii .",
    "a discussion of the results is given in section iii , while a few concluding remarks are made in section iv .",
    "the section gives the essential steps of gps approach , as implemented here for the solution of single - particle schrdinger equation for a non - relativistic hamiltonian containing an exponentially screened potential term .",
    "the key advantage of the approach is that it offers a _",
    "non - uniform , optimal _ spatial discretization .",
    "that means one can use a finer grid at small @xmath28 and coarser grid at large @xmath28 , maintaining high - accuracy at both these regions .",
    "this also implies only a small number of spatial points suffices to achieve convergence .",
    "thus compared to standard finite difference / finite element methods , the gps scheme is both accurate and efficient .",
    "other details could be found in the references @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise mentioned , atomic unit is used throughout the article .",
    "the radial schrdinger equation can be written in the following working form , @xmath29 r_{n,\\ell}(r ) = e_{n,\\ell}\\ r_{n,\\ell}(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is as given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) or ( 2 ) , whereas @xmath31 , @xmath32 signify the usual radial and angular momentum quantum numbers respectively .    as a key step ,",
    "a function @xmath33 , defined in the interval @xmath34 $ ] , is approximated by the n - th order polynomial , @xmath35 , through a cardinal function @xmath36 , as follows : @xmath37 this guarantees that the approximation is _ exact _ at the _ collocation points _",
    "@xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 , and requires that the cardinal function satisfies @xmath40 .",
    "here we use the legendre pseudospectral method , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and the @xmath43 are obtained from roots of first derivatives of the legendre polynomial , @xmath44 with respect to @xmath45 , as @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath36 are given by , @xmath47 now , the semi - infinite domain @xmath48 $ ] is mapped onto a finite domain @xmath34 $ ] via the transformation @xmath49 .",
    "at this stage , one could introduce an algebraic nonlinear mapping of the form , @xmath50 with l and @xmath51 as two mapping parameters , to obtain a transformed differential equation as : @xmath52 .",
    "now , one applies the legendre pseudospectral method to this equation and finally a symmetrization procedure to yield the following _ symmetric _ eigenvalue problem , @xmath53 \\chi_j = \\epsilon_{nl } \\chi_i .\\ ] ] this is readily solved by standard available routines such as that in nag fortran library , giving highly accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "after some straightforward algebra , one finds that , @xmath54 with @xmath55 , while @xmath56 denotes the symmetrized second derivative of cardinal function , given as follows , @xmath57 a series of calculation was performed for various potential parameters with respect to the grid mapping parameters to ascertain the accuracy and reliability of the current method . in this way",
    ", a  stable \" grid was found , which appears to be sufficient for all the converged results presented in this article . unless otherwise mentioned ,",
    "all the reported results correspond to this consistent set of parameters , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "there are some instances , where this set is not adequate , and appropriate variations are allowed ; these are mentioned appropriately in the text .",
    "current results are reported only up to the precision that maintained stability .",
    "eigenvalues are _ truncated _ rather than _ rounded - off _ , and hence may be considered as correct up to all the decimal places they are reported .    at this stage , a few remarks may be made regarding the gps method . typically in direct numerical methods ,",
    "one truncates the semi - infinite domain into a finite domain @xmath60 $ ] to deal with the problems of singularity at @xmath61 , and infinite domain . in order for this ,",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 need to be chosen sufficiently small and large respectively .",
    "this consequently results in a rather large number of grid points and also , in general , introduces some truncation error . to overcome this problem",
    ", one can map the semi - infinite domain @xmath64 $ ] exactly into the finite domain [ @xmath651,1 ] using the mapping @xmath66 ( eq .",
    "6 ) so that the legendre pseudopotential technique can be applied .",
    "this introduces an additional undesirable feature ; namely it leads to an unsymmetric or generalized eigenvalue problem , which in turn , is bypassed via the symmetrization procedure mentioned above .",
    "the method has been successfully applied to resonance states as well . for these and",
    "many other features of the method , the interested reader is referred to the references @xcite and those therein .",
    ".[tab : table1]calculated negative eigenvalues e ( in a.u . ) of some selected @xmath17 states of the ecsc potential for various @xmath16 along with the literature data .",
