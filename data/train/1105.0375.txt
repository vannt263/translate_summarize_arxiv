    "until recently , information about the inter- and intra- molecular forces involved in the stability of the double stranded dna ( dsdna ) was obtained _ in vitro _ through indirect physical and thermodynamic measurements like nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , light scattering , crystallography , differential scanning calorimetry etc . @xcite .",
    "such information is needed to understand two key biological processes , _",
    "i.e. _ , replication and transcription , where a dsdna is required to separate ( fully or partially ) into two single stranded dna ( ssdna ) @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the stability of dsdna is the result of hydrogen bonding between bases , backbone conformational constraints , electrostatic interactions and the coordination of water molecules @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "single molecule force spectroscopy ( smfs ) experiments using optical tweezers , atomic force microscope etc . , have directly measured these forces and provided unprecedented insight into the mechanism involved in the process of dna separation and its stability @xcite .",
    "so far , there does not exist any model that accurately describes the force - induced melting behavior of dsdna as a function of nucleotide sequence .",
    "simple models , e.g , poland scheraga ( ps ) model @xcite or peyrard - bishop - dauxious ( pbd ) model @xcite have described some of the essential macroscopic features of the meting profile of dsdna quite effectively and predicted that the force - induced melting transition is a first order transition @xcite . however , semi - microscopic information about the opening such as whether a dsdna opens from the end or interior of the chain , distribution of partially opened regions in the form of bubbles in the chain @xcite , are some of the intriguing issues in these studies . moreover , in all smfs experiments",
    ", the experimental setup puts an extra constraint on the ends of the chain , which makes force - induced melting different from the thermal melting .",
    "these constraints do not matter in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , all smfs experiments involve a finite length of the strand and hence these constraints may affect the melting profile of the chain @xcite .",
    "considered the self - avoiding walk @xcite model of dsdna @xcite of homosequence and obtained the force - temperature diagram for a small chain length .",
    "it was shown that constraining the end , affects the melting profile significantly .",
    "the aim of this manuscript is to study the effects of these constraints on the melting profile of heterosequence of finite length single molecule experiments and provide semi microscopic information about the formation of bubbles in the form of partially opened regions during the opening of a dsdna .",
    "more precisely , by employing the probability analysis of opening of individual bases , we delineate the mechanism involved in the separation of a dsdna .",
    "for this , we adopt the pbd model , @xcite which has been discussed in section ii . in this section ,",
    "we also introduce the method to calculate the melting profile and probability analysis to monitor the opening of individual base pairs ( bps ) .",
    "melting profiles of two different sequences @xcite , whose end(s ) is(are ) constrained by the experimental setups are discussed in section iii .",
    "the method developed in section ii , has been extended to study the force induced melting of dsdna in section iv .",
    "the paper ends with a brief discussion in section v.",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the basic features of the pbd model , which considers the stretching between corresponding bases only .",
    "unlike the ps model @xcite which is based on the two state model ( bound segment or unbound segment ) , the pbd model @xcite includes intermediate state because the stretching is a continuously varying variable . here",
    ", we ignore the helecoidal structure @xcite of dsdna and properties associated with it and focus only on the stretching of hydrogen bonds , which are represented by continuous variables @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the length of the chain ) .",
    "the sequence dependence in the model hamiltonian can be introduced through the potential energy term appearing in the hamiltonian . the nonlinear term which corresponds to the stacking energy between consecutive base pairs along the strand ,",
    "mimics the long range effects along the dsdna strand .",
    "the model hamiltonian is @xcite , @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4y@xmath5 , represents the momentum part of the hamiltonian and @xmath6 is the reduced mass of a base pair ( taken to be the same for both a - t and g - c base pairs here ) .",
    "the hydrogen bond interaction between two bases in the @xmath7 pair is represented by , the morse potential , @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the potential depth , roughly equal to the bond energy and @xmath10 represents the inverse of the width of the potential well .",
    "the stacking interaction between two consecutive base pairs along the chain is represented by , @xmath11\\ ] ] in the hamiltonian , where @xmath12 represents the single strand elasticity , @xmath13 represents the anharmonicity in the strand elasticity and @xmath14 represents its range .",
    "the canonical partition function of the system can be written as @xmath15\\right\\ } = z_pz_c\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the momentum part and configurational part of the partition function respectively .",
    "since the momentum part is decoupled in the integration , it can be integrated out as a simple gaussian integral , which contributes a factor @xmath18 to the partition function @xcite .",
    "the configurational part of the partition function , @xmath17 , is @xmath19.\\ ] ] for the homo sequence , one can evaluate the partition function by the transfer integral ( ti ) method with periodic boundary condition . in case of heterosequence the integration in the configurational partition function",
    "can be carried out numerically with the help of matrix multiplication method @xcite .",
    "once the limits of integration have been chosen , the task is to discretized the space so that the integral can be evaluated numerically . here",
    ", we fix the lower and upper limits of the integration to be @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the space is discretized using the gaussian quadrature formula @xcite with a certain number of grid points . in our previous study @xcite ,",
    "it was shown that to get precise value of the melting temperature ( @xmath21 ) , one has to choose large number of grid points . in this study , 900 grid points are found to be sufficient to obtain the melting profile of the chain .",
    "since all the matrices in eq.(3 ) are identical , the multiplication is straight forward .",
    "the free energy per base pair is obtained from the following relation , @xmath22 the thermodynamic quantities of interest _",
    "e.g. _ the number of intact base pairs ( @xmath23 ) @xcite and the specific heat ( @xmath24 ) of the system may be evaluated by using the following relations , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the heaviside step function .",
    "we set the limit , @xmath27 equal to 1@xmath28 , above which a base pair is considered to be in the open state .",
    "the emphasis of present work is to evaluate the probability of opening of particular base pairs at a given external condition .",
    "the probability of opening of the @xmath29 pair in the sequence is defined as @xcite , @xmath30z_j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31\\prod_{i = 1}^{n }    dy_i   \\exp[-\\beta h(y_i , y_{i+1 } ) ]   \\exp\\left[-\\beta \\frac{v(y_n)}{2}\\right]\\ ] ] is the partition function of the chain for the open boundary condition and @xmath32\\ ] ]",
    "[ fig2 ]   is scaled by peak value of @xmath24 , title=\"fig : \" ]    we first investigate the thermal melting of dsdna in the absence of end constraints and applied force .",
    "the values of the relevant model parameters are chosen in such a way that the melting temperature of long homogeneous sequences , is reproduced @xcite .",
    "the values @xmath33 , @xcite are used in the partition function to obtain the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "after fixing the parameters , we consider the two sequences @xcite , as shown in fig . 1 , to study the probability distribution of bubbles and the location of their initiation .",
    "it may be noted here that the two sequences are almost the same except that in the sequence i , half of the base pairs are of gc type ( we call it as gc rich end ) while sequence ii has at rich end ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    [ fig3 ]",
    "first we consider a situation , where both ends of the given sequences are free ( fig.1a ) .",
    "this has been well studied in the context of thermal melting . for short sequences ,",
    "the transition is well understood by the two state theory and the chain opens from the end .",
    "( [ eqn2]-7 ) , we obtained the melting profiles , which is shown in fig . 2 and calculated the melting temperature @xmath21 , where half of the total base pairs of a given sequence are open .",
    "it is to be noted that the peak in the specific heat coincides with the melting temperature and is consistent with earlier value obtained through path integration technique @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a phase transition where the system goes from the bound state to the open state .",
    "interestingly , the sequence which has gc rich end exhibits the higher melting temperature , shows that sequence i is more stable than the sequence ii .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in order to have a better understanding of the role of the sequence on the opening mechanism of dsdna , we have also studied the opening of sequence ii . when the chain is constrained from either of the ends ,",
    "the resistance from the stronger segment which span about 20 base pairs ( 31 - 49 ) is clearly visible . for the case",
    "when chain is constrained from 5 -end , chain has the two weaker segments one at the 3-end and the another close to 5-end .",
    "in addition to the resistance from the stonger segment , a small patch of about 5 gc base pairs puts an extra constraint , which restricts the opening from the 5-end . as a result",
    ", the probability of opening of 3-end is found to be larger , indicating that the chain opens from the 3-end .",
    "the melting temperature of this chain is lower than the sequence i. for rest of the conformations , as observed for sequence i , such kind of striking difference has not been observed .",
    "this sequence has more end point entropy in comparison to sequence i. thus , constraining either of the ends simply means that the contribution to melting from the end is being restricted ( fig 1 b & c ) .",
    "it may be noted the sequence ii has a segment of 52 base pairs of at at 3 -end while about 28 base pairs of at at 5 -end . in the case",
    "when both ends are constrained , the chain opens from its weaker segments .",
    "we now investigate how the opening mechanism of the sequences changes when the chain is subjected to an external force at either ends .",
    "the modified hamiltonian of the system under the applied force can be written as @xmath34 we have included a term @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) , which shows that force is applied on the end pair . here",
    ", our emphasis is not to calculate the critical force @xcite , but to focus on the way the chain opens by calculating the probability of opening of base pairs as a function of the applied force .",
    "[ force ]    [ fig6 ]    the plots which show the influence of applied force at one end while the other end is fixed , are shown in fig . 6 in the form of probability profiles for sequences",
    "i and ii . these plots clearly demonstrate that the opening of the chains under mechanical stress is significantly different from thermal melting . when a force is applied on the @xmath36 pair ( 5-end ) , keeping the @xmath37 pair ( 3-end ) constrained , sequence i ( fig 6a ) , opens from the weaker segment and the transition from the zipped state to unzipped state is quite smooth .",
    "in contrast , for sequence ii , although there is a force on the @xmath36 pair , there is an entropic contribution because of the formation of a bubble ( about 60 base pairs ) at the other end ( fig 6c ) .",
    "the critical forces for the two sequences are found to differ by 10 pn , as sequence ii is weaker than the sequence i. this is because at 300 k , the segments containing at pairs have a large probability of opening , and thus the chain opens from both ends and critical force reduces .",
    "for sequence i , when the force is applied at the 3-end , keeping the 5-end constrained ( fig 6b ) , one requires a bit larger force to open the stronger segment of the chain .",
    "one can see from the plot that the probability of opening of the 30 base pairs near the 5-end is around 0.25 , even though the chain is constrained at that end .",
    "we find that the transition is quite sharp and the chain opens abruptly as the gc segment opens up . for sequence",
    "ii , we do not observe similar behaviour as there are stronger segments of about 20 base pairs in between the two weaker segments of at base pairs . as a result",
    ", the chain opens from the 3-end , but the loop containing at base pairs reduces the unzipping force .",
    "however , the opening mechanism does not change because of it .",
    "this suggests that the unzipping force depends on the sequence of the chain as well as the on the end which has been constrained .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the thermal melting and the force induced unzipping of two sequences having gc rich end and at rich end , respectively .",
    "the melting temperature of these sequences only give information about half of the base pairs , which are open . using pbd model ,",
    "we have calculated the probability of opening of the entire sequence to see how the chain opens .",
    "motivated by recent smfs experiments , we constrained one end of the chain and showed that the mechanism of opening of dsdna not only depends on the sequence of base pairs , but also on which end has been constrained by the experimental setup .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat some of these experiments by interchanging the constrained ends .",
    "it is also surprising to note that in the study of the force induced unzipping using pbd model , the bubbles do not play a significant role .",
    "this could be due to fact that in this model , opening of a bead is restricted to move in one dimension only and thus entropy of the loop has been underestimated .",
    "it would be nice to repeat these experiments by attaching different tags at the weaker junction and to see how the chain opens during thermal melting and force induced unzipping .",
