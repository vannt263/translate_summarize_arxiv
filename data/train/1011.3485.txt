    "most ordered phases of condensed matter can be classified using the concept of symmetry breaking , which leads to a theoretical description in terms of landau - ginzburg field theories .",
    "such theories have had remarkable successes , such as the quantitative explanation of critical phenomena .",
    "topological phases such as the quantum hall effect require a different type of description in terms of `` topological field theories '' .",
    "these theories have the remarkable property that they are independent of the spacetime metric .",
    "the most famous example is the description of quantum hall phases by chern - simons theory , which we review in a moment .",
    "as shown by wen , that theory leads to detailed predictions about edge tunneling experiments on fractional quantum hall samples , which to some degree have been verified at least qualitatively .",
    "recently new topological phases of electrons with time - reversal symmetry have been discovered .",
    "these `` topological insulators ''  @xcite result from spin - orbit coupling and exist both in two   and three   dimensions , unlike the quantum hall effect , which is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "these phases are insulating in bulk but support conducting edge or surface states .",
    "hence one picture of a topological insulator is as a bulk insulator that necessarily has conducting edge or surface states ; more recently there has been considerable interest in the electromagnetic response  @xcite when a weak time - reversal - breaking perturbation gaps the surface state of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulator .",
    "our goal in this work is to find an effective field theory description of topological insulator phases in the same spirit as the chern - simons effective theory of the quantum hall effect .    in order to understand why we do not consider the electromagnetic response in the 3d topological insulator to be a topological field theory in the sense of chern - simons theory ,",
    "it is useful to review the quantum hall case . in the quantum hall effect",
    ", the chern - simons theory appears in two forms .",
    "we assume for now a single - component theory , such as describes the laughlin states at @xmath3 . in terms of an internal gauge field @xmath4 and an integer @xmath5 , the chern - simons lagrangian density is l_cs = ^a__a_. [ csl ] upon coupling this term to electromagnetic fields @xmath6 by adding the term l_c = - j^a _ , j^= 1 2 ^ _",
    "a_integrating out the internal gauge field @xmath4 generates a term for the electromagnetic gauge field @xmath6 that has the _ same _ chern - simons form as the internal gauge theory , but with coefficient @xmath7 rather than @xmath8 .",
    "( note that @xmath6 does not include the background magnetic field generating the quantum hall state . )",
    "so for the quantum hall effect , both the internal theory and the electromagnetic term have the same chern - simons form . the chern - simons theory on a closed two - dimensional manifold has a set of @xmath9 zero - energy states , where @xmath10 is the genus of the manifold , and an infinite gap to other states .",
    "the quantum hall response is generated by the ground state s response to electromagnetic perturbations in similar fashion to the superflow in a superconductor . on a manifold with boundary ,",
    "the bulk chern - simons theory alone is not gauge - invariant , because under a gauge transformation , ( [ csl ] ) changes by a total derivative .",
    "this total derivative leads to the topological part of the gapless edge theory ; combining it with non - universal interactions from the edge gives the chiral luttinger liquid description of edge states .    our general goal is to carry through a similar program for topological insulators .",
    "we note that many features of three - dimensional topological insulators with gapped surfaces have been understood in terms of a total - derivative term for electromagnetic fields known as `` axion electrodynamics ''  @xcite : _ em = = ^ f _ f_. [ axioncoupling ] this is analogous to the electromagnetic chern - simons term for @xmath11 in the quantum hall effect .",
    "it is `` topological '' in two senses : it is a total derivative of the electromagnetic chern - simons term , indicating that the surfaces where @xmath12 changes support a half - integer quantum hall effect .",
    "its microscopic origin in a crystal is definitely topological as it involves the chern - simons form of the berry connection of the bloch electrons  @xcite .",
    "we will argue that the natural description of the internal gauge theory takes a different form , which is one important difference between the quantum hall and topological insulator cases .",
    "note that one difference between the axion coupling and the chern - simons term is that the axion term is gauge - invariant , while the chern - simons term is only gauge - invariant up to a boundary term .",
    "so any theory based purely on the axion coupling for an internal gauge field can not generate a dynamical boundary from the requirement of gauge invariance in the way that the chern - simons theory does .",
    "our approach leads to a version of @xmath0 topological field theory in two and three dimensions as the effective description of topological insulators .",
    "this theory , which we introduce starting with the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case in the following section , preserves time - reversal and parity symmetries , unlike the chern - simons theory ; in particular it also can exist in three dimensions ( 3d ) , again unlike the chern - simons theory . in two dimensions",
    ", it is well known that the relevant @xmath0 theory can be recast as two copies of chern - simons theory  @xcite , but we will argue that the @xmath0 picture captures better the important properties of the 2d topological insulator , in particular its intrinsic time - reversal invariance .",
    "we obtain the 2d @xmath0 theory heuristically in the following section starting from the distinctive response of a 2d topological insulator to an electromagnetic @xmath1 flux ( i.e. , insertion of a solenoid with flux @xmath13 )  . in 3d ,",
    "the @xmath0 theory involves one vector gauge field @xmath4 and one rank - two tensor field @xmath14 .",
    "these fields are associated with the distinctive response of a 3d topological insulator to a flux _ line _",
    "@xcite , which is closely related to the response of the `` weak '' topological insulator to a dislocation  @xcite .",
    "so in both 2d and 3d we can understand @xmath0 theory from the attachment of nontrivial responses to electromagnetic flux .",
    "section iii introduces some general features of @xmath0 theories of relevance to topological insulators , and section iv provides more details for the 2d case .",
    "section v contains most of the main results of this paper on the 3d case .",
    "one type of electromagnetic coupling is present even with time - reversal symmetry , while breaking time - reversal symmetry at the boundary is shown to lead to the @xmath15 term after integrating out the internal fields of @xmath0 theory .",
    "the electromagnetic current contains both `` charge '' and `` polarization '' contributions , and we obtain the `` wormhole effect ''  @xcite along flux lines with gapped surfaces as a consequence of the coupling .",
    "the existence of the dirac fermion at surfaces when time - reversal - symmetry is present , which is the last result in section v , becomes more understandable on noting that the combination of scalar and vector bosons that the bulk @xmath0 theory implies at the surface are precisely those required to represent a dirac fermion via the explicit `` tomographic '' mapping in 2 + 1d  @xcite .",
    "some generalizations and future directions are reviewed in section vi ; one is that the @xmath0 theory description allows for fractional statistics not just in 2d but in 3d  @xcite .",
    "this does not contradict the classic argument that pointlike objects do not have fractional statistics in 3d  @xcite because the fractional statistics are between one pointlike and one stringlike object .",
    "as yet there is no microscopic realization of a `` fractional '' topological insulator ( we discuss some issues in closing ) , but the @xmath0 approach can at least formally describe such states . rather than try to give an overview of the other features of @xmath0 theory at the outset",
    ", it seems desirable to proceed with deriving it from the @xmath1 flux response in the simplest case , then explain how other features of topological insulators arise in the @xmath0 theory .",
    "in topological insulators , an electromagnetic @xmath1 flux has special roles both in 2d and 3d .",
    "when @xmath1 flux is threaded , there are always some excitations which are stable to any local @xmath16- symmetric perturbation . in 2d tis ,",
    "@xmath1 flux can induce spin - charge separation with semionic statistics . in 3d tis , @xmath1 flux creates helical 1d metals .",
    "since this property is topological , @xmath1 flux response can be used to distinguish tis from trivial phases without referring to edge states . however , @xmath1 flux is a strong perturbation from the point of view of an electron because the electron wavefunction gains a @xmath17 phase factor when it is rotated around the flux .",
    "if our goal is to depict the ti as a condensed phase , as in the early work on the chern - simons description of the quantum hall effect , then for the condensate to consist of charge @xmath18 objects , the phase factor must be somehow compensated if the @xmath1 flux is to be a finite - energy excitation .",
    "so there must be another global effect that compensates the @xmath17 phase factor for electrons when @xmath1 flux is threaded .",
    "we will show that this is the origin of a bf - type action .",
    "let s consider a vortex threaded into a 2d condensate of charge @xmath20 objects ( electrons ) .",
    "consider the condensate wave function @xmath21 and a @xmath22 electromagnetic gauge field @xmath23 in a vortex configuration .",
    "the lagrangian density for the single vortex follows @xmath24 : @xmath25 the minimum energy configuration for @xmath21 is easy to obtain : @xmath26 where @xmath12 is the angle with respect to @xmath27-axis in 2d .",
    "this distribution of @xmath21 has two key features .",
    "first , it minimizes the vortex potential @xmath28 .",
    "second , @xmath21 is single - valued because of the angle dependence   @xmath29 . and",
    "if we substitute this distribution of @xmath21 into equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , we obtain just @xmath30 the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) fixes the field configuration of @xmath23 to make the system have finite energy : @xmath31 should be reduced into @xmath32 as @xmath33 . otherwise , the energy of the vortex is simply infinite which is not physically acceptable . due to this constraint ,",
    "the flux trapped in the vortex configuration is quantized by @xmath19 : @xmath34 in general , the single - valuedness requires @xmath35 which corresponds to an @xmath36-vortex configuration .",
    "then this gives the total flux @xmath37 threaded in the 2d condensate .",
    "hence , we directly see that @xmath1 flux is not allowed for the vortex configuration with finite energy .",
    "thus , we need another component in the theory to deal with @xmath1 flux vortex .      as explained in the previous section , a finite - energy vortex configuration with @xmath1 flux is seemingly excluded for a charge-@xmath18 condensate .",
    "this result can be traced back to the phase factor @xmath17 for electrons rotating around @xmath1 flux .",
    "thus , if there is a way to create another phase factor @xmath17 for electrons , then @xmath38 would allow @xmath1 flux in the vortex configuration with finite energy .",
    "this is done by introducing a @xmath22 statistical gauge field @xmath4 that couples to electrons .",
    "this is depicted in the figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "now the lagrangian ( [ eq1 ] ) is replaced by the following equation .",
    "@xmath39 both gauge fields @xmath23 and @xmath40 carry flux @xmath1 for the simplest case",
    ". however , @xmath40 can carry @xmath41 flux ( or equivalently , @xmath1 flux of @xmath40 induces phase factor @xmath42 ) because the single - valuedness of the wave function only requires the total phase change to be @xmath37 in rotating around vortex .",
    "for the purpose of deriving the bf - type action , @xmath43 is enough , and we will stick to @xmath43 in this section , but the generalization to @xmath44 is trivial , and the importance for @xmath44 will be pointed out later when we discuss the statistics of@xmath0theory and the @xmath45-ness of tis . with the same ansatz @xmath26 as before , we get the lagrangian density for the gauge fields @xmath40 and @xmath23 : @xmath46 we can use the standard dual representation for the vortex by introducing an auxiliary @xmath22 field @xmath47 . then the lagrangian density ( [ eq4 ] ) can be written as the following : @xmath48 now the key step of the dual representation follows : writing @xmath49 .",
    "the integration ( or gauging away ) of @xmath50 gives the constraint @xmath51 .",
    "this can be solved by introducing another @xmath22 gauge field @xmath52 such that @xmath53 , and this transformation is enough to show there should be a bf - type term in the lagrangian to deal with @xmath1 flux vortex . after using the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the field strength of @xmath52 .",
    "finally , we identify the vortex current as @xmath57 , and write the lagrangian in a slightly different form : @xmath58 now we note that the first two terms in the equation ( [ eq5 ] ) are induced by the vortex configuration , and argue that the effective theory for the background ti should be the third term including two gauge fields @xmath40 and @xmath52 with non - dynamical external gauge field @xmath23 .",
    "another way to motivate discarding the first term is that , when we deal with long - range and low - energy physics , we can ignore this maxwell - like term for the same reason that pure chern - simons theory is the effective theory for quantum hall systems : the third term in equation [ eq5 ] includes only one derivative , whereas the maxwell - like term carries two derivatives and is relatively small at long length scales . with slightly different normalization , we obtain the effective theory for the 2d topological insulator : @xmath59 the first term in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) is current - gauge coupling where the current is mediated by the gauge field @xmath52 .",
    "the second term is called the @xmath0 term ( because it includes the gauge field @xmath52 and the field strength of the @xmath40 field ) , and it contains the coupling between @xmath40 and @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 term is topological , i.e it does not carry dynamics ; rather it carries the information of statistics between sources of @xmath40 and @xmath52 .",
    "note that the first term is actually a @xmath0 term as well , coupling the internal field @xmath52 and the external field @xmath23 .",
    "this type of mixed @xmath0 term has previously been obtained for the 2d topological insulator by goryo et al .",
    "the meaning of the coefficients and the @xmath0 term will be clarified in the next section , and in this section we focus on consequences of ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "there is an interesting property for the equation ( [ eq6 ] ) : if we integrate out @xmath40 and @xmath52 , then the resulting action is @xmath60 , i.e. , the bulk effective action for @xmath23 is @xmath60 .",
    "so if we want to have an electromagnetic response due to the external gauge field @xmath23 , we need another term coupled to @xmath40 , as in the @xmath16-breaking chern - simons term for the quantum hall effect .",
    "another difference is that the @xmath0 theory with @xmath23 above preserves @xmath61- and @xmath16- symmetry which will be clear in the next section .",
    "looking ahead , a key feature of this @xmath0 theory is that it has a direct 3d generalization ; for 3d , we will similarly derive the existence of a two - form gauge field @xmath52 coupled to @xmath40 and @xmath23 , @xmath62 then the equation ( [ eq7 ] ) inherits the properties of 2d @xmath0 theory ( [ eq6 ] ) : it is topological , the effective action of @xmath23 is zero , and it is @xmath61- and @xmath16- symmetric .",
    "our goal in this paper is to argue that @xmath0 theory is the effective theory for tis in a way similar to cs theory for the quantum hall effect . before continuing with that argument ,",
    "let us review a few more properties of @xmath0 theory .",
    "@xmath0 theory is a generalization of cs theory , and both are topological  @xcite ; in fact , the relationship between @xmath0 and cs theory is fairly simple in ( 2 + 1)d .",
    "this relationship is essentially the same as the microscopic relationship between ( two copies of ) the integer quantum hall effect and the 2d ti .",
    "but there are important differences between @xmath0 and cs theory , such as symmetry ; some similarities and differences between cs and @xmath0 theory in two and three spatial dimensions will be reviewed in the following .",
    "versions of @xmath0 theory have been applied in condensed matter physics previously to study superconductors and topological spin liquids  @xcite , but not topological insulators as far as we are aware .",
    "henceforth we follow the condensed matter convention and refer to systems by their spatial dimension , e.g. , 2d means ( 2 + 1)d .      the most general form of @xmath0 theory in 2d",
    "is composed of two @xmath22 gauge fields @xmath40 , @xmath52 and corresponding sources @xmath63 , @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "the full @xmath0 action is @xmath65 the first term in equation is topological and describes braiding statistics with parameter @xmath5 : when the quasiparticle type @xmath63 is rotated around the quasiparticle type @xmath64 , the total wave function obtains @xmath66 .",
    "this term has the same role as the term @xmath67 in cs theory , and the equations of motion are also simply obtained : @xmath68 the symmetries of the gauge fields @xmath40 and @xmath52 are different : under @xmath16 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "so the @xmath0 term in the equation ( [ eq7 ] ) is @xmath16 - invariant .",
    "armed with these , we reconsider the effective theory ( [ eq6 ] ) : @xmath71 two comments about this theory are in order .",
    "first , because @xmath72 under @xmath16- transformation ( the same symmetries as the @xmath40 gauge field , which is why it is natural to describe the @xmath1 vortex by combining @xmath23 and @xmath40 ) , we see that the theory is @xmath16- invariant , i.e. , the minimal coupling between @xmath23 and @xmath52 is @xmath16- symmetric .",
    "@xmath23 acts as a source of @xmath52 field .",
    "secondly , our theory for topological insulators is described by @xmath73 , and this makes sense because @xmath1 flux of @xmath40 field should give the phase factor @xmath17 to the total wave function as we discussed @xmath1 flux vortex theory(in fact , @xmath73 corresponds to the semionic statistics for @xmath40 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "however , this is not the only coefficient giving phase factor @xmath17 between @xmath40 and @xmath52 . in general , @xmath74 should be equally good because @xmath42 .",
    "so the most general theory with @xmath1 flux having the proper statistical effect has the form : @xmath75    for any value of @xmath36 , the effective action for @xmath23 is still @xmath60 , so there is no ( bulk ) response to the external field @xmath23 . before getting into the details of the system s response",
    ", it should be noted that the action of 2d @xmath0 theory is just doubled cs theory with opposite chirality ; while it is known that the 2d ti can be realized as the double copy of quantum hall layers with opposite chirality , the above theory is saying that this is true for some properties , such as the existence of edge modes , even when there is no conserved component of spin .",
    "the equation can be equally well derived if we start from doubled cs theory and pick appropriate combinations of the two cs fields ( `` charge '' and `` spin '' ) .",
    "however , it is well known that tis can be described only by doubled cs theories describing odd - integer quantum hall effects , and we wish to emphasize here that this is really coming from the @xmath1 flux response , which is a defining property of tis , and not from the assumption of decoupled spin - up and spin - down layers .",
    "the most general form of 3d @xmath0 theory includes a one - form gauge field @xmath76 , an antisymmetric two - form gauge field @xmath77 , and corresponding sources @xmath78 , @xmath79  @xcite . here",
    ", the source @xmath80 is an antisymmetric rank 2 tensor , so physically the source @xmath80 represents the density of line - like objects that can be pictured as field lines for electric and magnetic parts of the tensor .",
    "we will later connect the magnetic and electric components of @xmath80 through the equations of motion .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 theory should contain information about braiding of vortices and quasiparticles .",
    "interestingly , 3d @xmath0 theory can be used to describe fractional statistics in 3d systems . the standard argument that pointlike particles can not have fractional statistics in 3d as they do in 2d",
    "@xcite is that all ways of looping one particle around another to detect their mutual statistics are topologically equivalent in 3d but not in 2d ; as a result , 3d statistics are described by the permutation group , and 2d statistics are described by the much richer braid group ",
    "one consequence is that in 2d , there are `` anyonic '' particles that are neither fermionic nor bosonic . in 3d , vortices and quasiparticles can braid noncontractibly like particles in 2d , allowing for statistics other than fermionic and bosonic .",
    "hence it is possible to impose nontrivial statistics between vortices and quasiparticles , and we will argue that this is what happens in 3d tis .",
    "the starting @xmath0 theory is the following : @xmath81 as in the 2d case , the first term carries the statistics : when quasiparticle @xmath63 is rotated around the vortex density @xmath80 , the total wave function obtains a phase factor @xmath66 .",
    "the equation of motion can be obtained by varying with respect to @xmath40 and @xmath52 : @xmath82 and as in 2d , @xmath73 ( or more generally , @xmath74 ) will describe a ti for which threading with @xmath1 flux yields the correct phase factor @xmath17 .",
    "the external field @xmath23 acts as a source for the two - form field @xmath52 if we look into the equation [ 7 ] . finally , this @xmath0 theory is @xmath16- symmetric because @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 .",
    "thus the minimal coupling between @xmath23 and @xmath52 is still @xmath16- symmetric , and the candidate theory for 3d tis with integer @xmath36 is following : @xmath88 as noted in 2d @xmath0 theory , we need a term coupled to @xmath40 to have a total bulk response of external gauge field @xmath23 , which will be obtained later .",
    "the physics of 2d tis is relatively easy to understand compared to that of 3d tis because a 2d ti can be realized as a bilayer integer quantum hall system with opposite @xmath16- symmetry , although this picture implicitly assumes a @xmath22 spin rotation symmetry and fails to capture the @xmath89 nature of the topological invariant .",
    "the role of the magnetic field in ordinary quantum hall systems is replaced by the spin - orbit interaction , whose symmetries require opposite integer quantum hall states of up and down spins along the @xmath22 axis . when there is no @xmath22 remnant of spin - rotation symmetry , we are forced to interpret @xmath90 as so - called time - reversal gauge field , and @xmath64 as the time - reversal - pair current .",
    "in fact , the above lagrangian for 2d tis is very similar to that of quantum hall systems , and many aspects of physics in 2d tis resemble those from quantum hall states .",
    "we quickly review the topological field theory description of quantum hall systems .",
    "let us consider a @xmath91 fractional quantum hall system , i.e. , the lowest landau level is 1/3 full .",
    "the system has elementary excitations with fractional charges : fractionalized quasiholes(@xmath92 ) and quasielectrons(@xmath93 ) .",
    "these excitations can be made in the system if we thread magnetic flux , and the braiding statistics of those quasiparticles are fractional .",
    "remarkably , these seemingly complicated properties can be simply formulated in cs theory : @xmath94 here @xmath5 parametrizes the braiding of quasiparticles and filling factor @xmath91 is described @xmath95 .",
    "the requirement of gauge invariance for the total action on a manifold with boundary , with @xmath96 as bulk action , leads to an edge chiral boson field which is indeed present in quantum hall systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if we integrate out the internal gauge field @xmath40 , we obtain the correct effective electromagnetic lagrangian for a state with hall effect @xmath97 : @xmath98 thus we can argue that cs theory is a valid effective theory for quantum hall systems due to its correct description of statistics of quasiparticles , correct effective theory for @xmath23 , and edge theory . in the next and subsequent sections",
    ", we will argue @xmath0 theory also captures statistics of quasiparticles , correct effective theory for @xmath23 and @xmath90 , and edge theory of 2d tis , i.e. , @xmath0 theory should be the correct effective theory for tis .",
    "topological insulators are gapped topologically ordered systems like quantum hall states , and thus it is natural that they could be described by a topological field theory . however , @xmath0 theory , unlike the simplest form of cs theory , involves two entities in the theory @xmath40 and @xmath52 with different symmetries . if we want to follow the philosophy of cs theory , then @xmath40 and @xmath52 should couple to currents of elementary excitations in the system . so it would be good to think of possible excitations in tis before moving into detailed mathematics .    to construct an analogy between cs theory and @xmath0 theory",
    ", we will stick to 2d tis in this section . in a quantum hall system",
    ", we can collect the elementary excitation by threading the magnetic flux .",
    "similarly , we can thread a flux of the external electromagnetic gauge field into a 2d ti , and it is known that we can have two types of excitations in the presence of a @xmath1 flux  @xcite . in 2d tis , the excitations are a charge - neutral kramers doublet ( charge @xmath60 and , if one component of spin is a good quantum number , spin@xmath99 ) and holon(charge@xmath100 and spin zero ) .",
    "so @xmath40 and @xmath52 should couple to the sources of external gauge fields which are currents of `` spinons '' and `` holons '' ; of course the external gauge field coupling to the kramers - doublet is not physical , and the other gauge field is ordinary @xmath22 electromagnetism .",
    "note that even if no @xmath22 component of spin rotation symmetry like @xmath101 is conserved microscopically , there are still two @xmath22 currents macroscopically , not just the @xmath22 charge current .",
    "this is reflected in the existence of two dissipationless edge modes that are asymptotically decoupled at low energy , and the generic existence of a dissipationless `` spin hall effect '' carried by edge states in an applied electric field even if the direction and magnitude of this spin hall effect are not quantized . in the @xmath0 description ,",
    "there are two @xmath22 currents of which one couples directly to the external electromagnetic field ; the quantized particle source of the `` spin '' gauge field can be visualized as one of the charge - neutral excitations created by insertion of a @xmath1 flux .",
    "we recall the previous @xmath0 theory written for 2d tis : @xmath71 from the above equation , we see that @xmath52 couples to @xmath23 and thus represents the field for holons",
    ". naturally , @xmath40 should represent spinons .",
    "more precisely , the current for @xmath40 couples to a fictitious time - reversal gauge field @xmath90 ; the term for the coupling between spinons and external time - reversal gauge fields was absent in the the previous discussions because we only dealt with the physical em field . to make the duality between @xmath40 and @xmath52 in 2d explicit ,",
    "we now add @xmath102 to our lagrangian density .",
    "then the full lagrangian for our system is obtained : @xmath103 the equations of motion for @xmath40 and @xmath52 can be obtained if we vary @xmath52 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath104 from the above equations , some important features can be directly read off .",
    "first , unit spinon and holon are localized at the @xmath1 flux of @xmath23 and @xmath90 from the equation of motion .",
    "second , this spinon and holon obey semionic statistics .",
    "thus , the above @xmath0 theory correctly describes the elementary excitations in 2d tis .",
    "now , consider the effective lagrangian for the external fields @xmath23 and @xmath90 obtained by integrating out @xmath40 and @xmath52 . by completing squares for @xmath40 and @xmath52 and integrating out them ,",
    "we obtain the following effective lagrangian : @xmath105 note that there is no bulk electromagnetic action for @xmath23 alone , consistent with the absence of a charge hall effect ; the effective action for @xmath23 and @xmath90 in bulk describes a `` quantum spin hall effect '' ( a spin current flows in response to a charge field and vice versa ) if there is a conserved current of spin in some direction . since we can trivially rewrite the bulk @xmath0 theory as a doubling of cs theory in 2d , it contains two chiral bosons at the edge , consistent with 2d tis .",
    "we will review the derivation of this edge theory later in section v as preparation for the surface theory of the 3d ti .    before finishing this section ,",
    "it is worth mentioning briefly how the @xmath0 theory can capture the physics of the `` @xmath106 odd '' property of 2d tis .",
    "consider an @xmath107-flavored @xmath0 theory to describe @xmath107 copies of 2d ti @xmath108 this edge of this lagrangian can be studied from the @xmath109-matrix of the system .",

    "then we are led to the simplified lagrangian @xmath115 this theory has a @xmath113-times amplified spin hall effect .",

    "3d topological insulators are described by four @xmath89 topological invariants , one `` strong '' and three `` weak '' .",
    "topological insulators with only nontrivial weak invariants can be adiabatically connected to layering of 2d topological insulators and are unstable to disorder . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong topological insulator is an intrinsically 3d system and does not have a two - dimensional limit .",
    "moreover , the essence of the 2d topological insulator can be understood relatively easily by considering `` quantum spin hall '' systems where a @xmath22 subgroup of spin rotation symmetry is preserved . however ,",
    "if we try to preserve a @xmath22 spin rotation in 3d topological insulators , we end up with only weak topological insulators rather than the strong topological insulator .",
    "this makes it difficult to understand the strong topological insulator because we need information about spins in the system but we can not identify states by a remaining spin quantum number .",
    "bf theory supplies a route around this difficulty . roughly speaking , the @xmath52 and @xmath40 fields in @xmath0 theory carry information about spin and charge and couple to the external electromagnetic gauge field @xmath23 . in this section , we will figure out what @xmath40 and @xmath52 should be on physical grounds and justify that our version of @xmath0 theory is a correct effective description of 3d strong topological insulators : it captures the quantized magnetoelectric effect  @xcite and the braiding of excitations in the system when the surfaces are gapped , and as mentioned in the introduction it also allows the possibility of gapless fermionic surfaces .",
    "as we did above for the 2d ti and @xmath0 theory , we need to identify the coupling for the internal gauge field @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath40 field is still a one - form even in ( 3 + 1)d @xmath0 theory , and the external gauge field @xmath23 is also a one - form .",
    "so the simplest coupling would be @xmath120 , but this breaks @xmath16- symmetry of the system as @xmath16 takes @xmath121 .",
    "however , note that the term is a total derivative and hence can be sourced from a surface where its coefficient changes , i.e @xmath122 .",
    "thus , we are led to conclude that our theory describes ti with broken @xmath16- invariance only on the surface .",

    ", we might expect @xmath157 to appear only on the edge as the hall current when we solve the equation of motion for @xmath52 , and it turns out to be so .",

    "one part is @xmath158 which is particle - like response , and the second part is @xmath165 which is like string or polarization response . with these in mind , we can cast our @xmath0 theory into the physically straightforward form @xmath173 the second term is the usual coupling of the em field and charge current .",
    "the third term is the coupling allowed by symmetry between ( magnetic and electric ) polarizations and the em field .",
    "the term shows up only in the nontrivial topological insulator .",
    "finally , the first term gives nontrivial braiding between particle and polarizations .",
    "this description will give in the next section the axion electrodynamics form of em responses of topological insulators with gapped surfaces that break @xmath16-symmetry once we integrate out the @xmath40 and @xmath52 fields .",
    "if on the other hand we did not break @xmath16- symmetry on the surfaces , then we will obtain a different description as seen below .    before finishing this section , we present the equations of motion for the fields @xmath40 and @xmath52 for future use .",

    "effectively , @xmath23 is the source for @xmath40 and @xmath52 .",
    "the most studied example for 3d ti is an em flux tube threading the bulk and its surface .",
    "the gauge configuration for @xmath40 is easy to capture as it describes another vortex tied to em vortex with the same magnitude . on the other hand , we need to be careful for @xmath52 as @xmath52 has more gauge degrees of freedom . for convenience ,",
    "we think of a ti with @xmath175 and the magnetic flux threading the surface at the origin .",

    "generically the surface is gapped for @xmath16- symmetry - breaking perturbations present on the surface .",
    "the gapped surface should not change the bulk properties much for weak perturbations , and we expect the edge theory to reflect some properties of the bulk theory .",

    "the edge 2d @xmath0 theory inherits topological properties from 3d bulk @xmath0 theory . in this section ,",
    "we derive the gapped edge theory of 3d ti in the same way as cs theory predicts a gapless edge theory of quantum hall states , and we explore the properties of the theory including the effects of an infinitely thin flux tube threading a 3d tis .      in this section ,",
    "we briefly review the derivation of the edge theory for cs theory in 2d .",

    "hence we introduce a scalar field @xmath185 living on the edge and gauge transform @xmath186 when @xmath183 .",
    "now gauge invariance forces us to write the action for our system as @xmath187 .",
    "however , the hamiltonian related to @xmath188 is zero .",
    "so we need an extra term to get the usual chiral edge theory ; this term reflects physics localized near the edge , while the zero - energy hamiltonian reflects a topological kinetic energy part coming from the bulk .    to introduce the edge term",

    "this surface dependence is manifest in that the coefficient for this term in the edge chiral theory depends on the material ; it determines the propagation velocity of the edge excitations .",
    "now we use similar arguments to derive the edge theory of 3d @xmath0 theory .      in this section",
    ", we derive the edge theory  @xcite of 3d @xmath0 theory by requiring the total theory with surface to have the same gauge invariance as the interior of the 3d sample . while doing so , another important feature of the bulk @xmath0 term shows up ; the bulk @xmath0 theory is not gauge invariant , just as above for cs theory .",
    "the surplus gauge degree of freedom goes to the edge and establishes the edge theory .",
    "we will initially study the case when the surface is gapped by a time - reversal - breaking perturbation , then return in the last part of this chapter to the question of how massless fermions appear when time - reversal symmetry is present . as before ,",
    "we ignore the numerical coefficients at first but will restore the coefficients later as the coefficients determine the statistics and hall effect on the edge .",
    "we start with the edge theory without external em gauge field @xmath23 .",
    "the answer for this system can be written simply by introducing a new scalar field @xmath193 whose values only are significant on the boundary and writing @xmath194 : @xmath195 this combined action is explicitly gauge - invariant if we define @xmath193 to transform @xmath196 when @xmath197 .",
    "( note : @xmath193 describes degrees of freedom only on the edge since in the bulk term @xmath198 ) .",
    "it is elementary to check the gauge invariance when @xmath199 .",
    "( we do not allow the variation with respect to @xmath52 on the edge ; rather we vary @xmath40 and @xmath193 independently . )",
    "when we vary the nondynamical field @xmath193 to obtain a constraint , we have @xmath200 , i.e. , @xmath52 is pure gauge on the edge . thus @xmath201 at least locally for the 2d edge by poincare s lemma and the edge action becomes simply 2d @xmath0 theory @xmath202 .",
    "when we include the coupling to an external gauge field @xmath23 , still the same idea applies and thus we can derive the edge theory . if we add @xmath203 and @xmath204 to the bulk action , then the term @xmath203 requires a term @xmath205 on the edge .",
    "however , @xmath204 is itself gauge invariant , so we do not need any additional term in the edge action and we can move the term @xmath206 freely to the edge for the case @xmath207 in the bulk , or vice versa .",
    "so we write the action for @xmath208 as @xmath209 we can move the term @xmath204 into the edge by gauss s law : @xmath210 the two actions ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) are physically equivalent .",
    "if we integrate out @xmath40 and @xmath52 in equation , then we obtain @xmath211 . on the other hand , if we integrate out @xmath40 and @xmath52 in equation , we obtain @xmath212 , identical to the case of equation .",
    "this illustrates that we can move every physical response to the em gauge field to the edge by moving the term @xmath204 .",
    "the effect of pushing this term to the edge is not only a surface hall effect but also statistical , and we will discuss this effect again later . for later use",
    "we restore the important coefficients for the action now .",
    "we take the edge to lie in the @xmath213 plane and assume that @xmath52 is a the pure gauge @xmath214 on the edge .",
    "then @xmath215 some comments are worthwhile here .",
    "first , the gauge invariance of the theory is guaranteed by @xmath216 when @xmath217 , and the gauge transformation of @xmath40 leaves the theory invariant as @xmath40 appears only as @xmath218 .",
    "secondly , when we move the term @xmath204 into the edge as @xmath219 , @xmath12 term appearing in the edge action should be interpreted as @xmath220 , and @xmath12 itself is not well - defined on the edge so the term proportional to @xmath221 is breaking @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "lastly , the sources of @xmath52 in bulk and @xmath222 on the surface are the same .",
    "if there is a source @xmath223 of @xmath222 on the surface that enters as @xmath224 , then @xmath223 should be a part of @xmath225 threading the surface ( explicitly , @xmath226 where @xmath162 is the normal vector to the surface ) .",
    "thus , there is no local excitation at the surface for @xmath52 or @xmath222 fields . with the full machinery ,",
    "we take the edge action of the 3d bulk action as the following : @xmath227 for the bulk action of equation , we have @xmath228 which is trivial for the @xmath23 field when @xmath40 and @xmath52 are integrated out : in this form the entire electromagnetic response comes from the surface .      in this section",
    ", we calculate the charge bound to a flux tube by using the gapped edge action we derived in the previous section .",
    "this provides some intuition for the meaning of the fields in the effective theory .",
    "we thread a @xmath1 flux tube through the 3d ti adiabatically .",
    "the flux tube is inserted into a thin cylinder in 3d tis , and the surface of the cylinder is itself an edge of the 3d ti .",
    "while doing so , we will use the gapped edge action because the cylinder is also part of the edge and thus gapped ( i.e. , we assume the same @xmath16-breaking perturbation continues along the cylinder ) .",
    "unfortunately , we can not get the gapless edge theory discussed in the next section from the gapped edge action by naively plugging in a @xmath1 flux configuration of @xmath23 field , but we can glimpse the effects of degrees of freedom living in the @xmath1 flux tube of 3d tis .    from the action for edge , there can be at most two degrees of freedom carried by @xmath222 and @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we can guess there are possibly two chiral modes to the gapless cylinder surface because of time reversal properties(or no localized mode ) ; indeed there are two gapless chiral modes at the infinitely thin cylinder with @xmath1 flux as expected .",
    "now , we calculate the charge bound to the @xmath1 flux at the end of the flux tube . for simplicity , we imagine an infinite bulk with the cylindrical hole at the center and assume that the flux remains spatially separated from the surface of the cylinder .",
    "we take the @xmath27-axis along the cylinder axis and the @xmath229-axis around the cylinder on the surface(we compactify @xmath229 direction ) .",
    "thus , the flux @xmath193 threaded in the cylinder is given by the integral of @xmath230 along the @xmath229 direction .",
    "@xmath231 given this external field @xmath23 , we have equations of motion for @xmath222 and @xmath40 . before deriving the equations of motion",
    ", we first identify the em current due to external em gauge field by @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the action for the edge : @xmath234 where we plugged @xmath163 .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath222 and @xmath40 are easily derived by varying with respect to @xmath40 and @xmath222 .",
    "@xmath235 thus , we have the following equation for the total current flowed along the cylinder .",
    "@xmath236 because the total flux at the end of threading process is @xmath1 , we obtain charge @xmath237 localized at the one side end of the flux tube and @xmath238 on the other side end of the flux .",
    "we wish to emphasize that this localized charge is exactly what is expected from the surface hall effect .",
    "when the surface of the ti is gapped , the surface hosts @xmath239(half the conductance quantum ; @xmath240 ) hall conductance , and thus we have charge @xmath237 when @xmath1 flux is threaded .",
    "one more comment is in order : as the surface explicitly breaks @xmath16- invariance , we can deduce that the system distinguishes @xmath1 from @xmath241 as far as the flux threads the surface .",
    "a consequence is that the charge localized at the tip of @xmath1 flux is different from that of the @xmath241 flux .",
    "however , if the flux totally lies in the bulk by making it a torus , then the system never distinguishes @xmath1 flux from @xmath241 flux .",
    "this can be easily seen from the bulk lagrangian .",
    "@xmath242 from this lagrangian , we see that @xmath1 flux is one unit of vorticity of the @xmath52 gauge field . upon encircling a unit source of @xmath40 around the @xmath1 flux ,",
    "the wave function obtains a phase factor @xmath243 which is equivalent to @xmath244 where @xmath241 flux is in place of @xmath1 flux .",
    "having reproduced the expected properties for gapped surfaces , we now turn to the emergence of dirac fermions at the surface of @xmath0 theory when time reversal is unbroken .      rather than a problem , it is a useful feature of 3d @xmath0 theory that the bulk theory by itself is not invariant under gauge transformations on a manifold with boundary .",
    "the gauge fields forced to live at the edge cancel out the surplus gauge freedom of the bulk theory . here",
    "we will study the gapless surface of 3d @xmath0 theory and will find explicit expressions for a surface dirac fermion field , constructed from the bosonic fields topologically required to exist at the surface of a 3d topological insulator .",
    "combined with the ability to reproduce the expected electromagnetic coupling for gapped surfaces , this fermionic boundary suggests strongly that 3d @xmath0 theory is the proper topological field theory for the 3d strong topological insulator .",
    "the basic idea is that 3d @xmath0 theory contains two bosonic fields at the edge  @xcite , one arising from @xmath76 and the other from @xmath77 .",
    "from these two bosonic fields , it is not obvious at first sight how to construct a fermion . fortunately , there are bosonized theories for ( 2 + 1)d fermions ( and other higher dimensions as well  @xcite ) which were originally constructed to generalize the well - known bosonization of ( 1 + 1)d fermionic systems .",
    "the key idea of these constructions , which can be made precise in terms of the `` topographic '' representation  @xcite , lies in describing the higher - dimensional system as an infinite number of ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional rays. the complicated part is in maintaining the fermi statistics of particles belonging to different rays .",
    "we will find that the dirac fermion constructed out of the two bosons predicted by @xmath0 theory shows the special property of the surface of 3d topological insulators that the momentum and the spin of electrons are locked to each other .    in this section ,",
    "we first start with the edges of 2d @xmath0 theory to clarify the structure of the surface edges of 3d @xmath0 theory , and move into the surface of 3d @xmath0 to obtain a dirac fermion .",
    "while we are dealing with the surface of 3d @xmath0 theory , we show that there are two gapless bosonic fields on the surface of 3d @xmath0 theory and proceed to the `` tomographic '' transformation of introducing rays .",
    "we can then compare the result to the bosonization of a single dirac fermion .    in order to emphasize the similarities between the 2d and 3d tis in the @xmath0 description , we review the edge of the 2d @xmath0 theory first and see how the surface theory of 3d @xmath0 can be thought of as an infinite number of `` rays '' described by the edge theory of 2d @xmath0 theory . to get the edge theory of 2d @xmath0 theory , we start by solving the bulk equations of motion of the 2d bulk @xmath0 theory , i.e @xmath245 , and @xmath246 with coulomb gauge @xmath247 . up to a constant , @xmath248 where @xmath161 is 2d bulk , and the dynamics on its edge @xmath181 is described by the fluctuations of @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "we see that there is a first - order edge lagrangian from the bulk : the hamiltonian is zero until we add additional non - universal terms generated by the boundary .    the physics becomes more transparent if we take symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of @xmath249 and @xmath250 . substituting @xmath251 and @xmath252 into the equation ( [ t1 ] ) ,",

    "the equations of motions for @xmath23 and @xmath233 are now understood as the continuity equations for the fluids , @xmath259 thus , there are two chiral bosonic modes flowing in opposite directions .",
    "moreover , we can see that the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ t2 ] ) is @xmath260 after quantization where @xmath261 is the magnitude of the one - dimensional momentum , and time - reversal symmetry forces @xmath262 .",
    "these bosonic modes can be viewed as the density excitations of a one - dimensional fermionic system via standard 1 + 1-dimensional bosonization .",

    "is then shown to be a bosonized version of a 2 + 1-dimensional free dirac fermion satisfying the expected conditions for a ti surface . starting with the @xmath0 theory with no @xmath16-breaking surface term and solving the bulk equations of motions for @xmath40 and @xmath52 with coulomb gauge ( @xmath263 , and @xmath264 ) , we obtain ( up to an overall constant ) @xmath265",
    "hence the surface theory contains a scalar field @xmath249 and a vector field @xmath222 , from which we need to construct fermions .",
    "the same surface theory for 3d @xmath0 theory has been obtained previously  @xcite ; we are not aware that the following connection between @xmath0 theory and surface dirac fermions or topological insulators has been made before .",
    "the topological part of the surface action for @xmath0 theories more generally is discussed in appendix b of ref .  .",
    "we assume that the effect of non - universal surface physics is to generate the potential terms @xmath266 analogous to the potential terms at the quantum hall edge .",
    "the constants @xmath267 and @xmath268 are non - universal and will ultimately determine the velocities of excitations , which we assume to be isotropic ; henceforth we set @xmath269 so that the velocities of propagation are unity and we can connect to some previous field theory literature .",
    "the surface equation of motion from varying @xmath249 is _",
    "t ^ij_i_j - ^2 = 0 which is the total derivative of _",
    "t ^ij _ j - _ i = 0 .",
    "[ eqm1 ] the equation of motion from varying @xmath270 is similarly the total derivative of _ t - _ i ^ij _ j = 0 .",
    "[ eqm2 ] but ( [ eqm1 ] ) and ( [ eqm2 ] ) are precisely the `` bose structure '' on one scalar and one vector boson that are required to construct massless fermionic fields via the tomographic representation ; the key equation ( 21 ) of ref .   is just the above with @xmath271 , @xmath272 , and we switch to that paper s notation in the following . for self - containedness and to make this result less mysterious , we reproduce the key steps from that work and the explicit expression for the dirac spinors . note that the first - order kinetic energy term obtained from @xmath0 theory is not what would be obtained from , e.g. , fluctuations of an elastic surface ; a bosonization approach to the ti surface seemingly inequivalent to ours has recently been proposed by vildanov  @xcite starting from a modified hydrodynamics of an incompressible fluid .",
    "we now proceed to the tomographic representation for the scalar @xmath23 and vector @xmath90 . , and we will quantize them to obtain two bosonic fields describing two incompressible fluids . the tomographic representation uses the following generalized delta function : @xmath273 this function is used to transform the usual cartesian representations of fields into the tomographic representation . for example , the tomographic transformation of a scalar field @xmath274 is defined as @xmath275 physically , @xmath276 represents the projected distance of @xmath277 from the origin along the direction @xmath278 . from now on ,",
    "we write @xmath12 for the direction of @xmath278 , i.e @xmath279 .",
    "scalar , spinor , and vector fields in the tomographic coordinates are denoted with an extra tilde .    from this definition , the following two useful relations can be obtained : @xmath280 @xmath281 note that the second equation manifests the connection between @xmath282 and @xmath283 that appears below in the identification of the surface theory as a single dirac fermion in condensed matter language .",
    "these are the standard tools for the tomographic representations of bosonization theory  @xcite .    with the radiation gauge for @xmath23 ( @xmath284 ) ,",
    "after tomographic transformation of @xmath23 and @xmath90 one obtains  @xcite _ 0 b(y , n ) & = & _ y^t a(y , n ) _ y b(y , n ) & = & _ 0^t a(y , n ) , and the longitudinal part of @xmath285 is constant and can be ignored .",
    "these describe bosons propagating with nonzero velocity along each ray direction @xmath286 .",
    "a spinor field in tomographic coordinates can be constructed for each ray as a normal - ordered version of ( y , n ) = c ( i , where @xmath150 is a normalization constant .",
    "the last step is to add a 2d `` klein factor '' that ensures the canonical anticommutation relations of fermions are satisfied not just on one ray but between different rays ; the end result is that @xmath287 is multiplied by an operator  @xcite o_n = ( i 2 _ 0^d^ ) where the charges @xmath288 and @xmath289 are ( n ) & = & _ -^_0 a(y , n )",
    "( n ) & = & _ -^_0 b(y , n ) .",
    "this fermion propagates with unit velocity in the @xmath290 direction and is the tomographic transform of a 2d massless dirac fermion .",
    "a subtle point is that there is another fermion field  @xcite @xmath291 propagating in the @xmath292 direction , but we note that the hermitian conjugate of @xmath293 is equivalent to @xmath294 up to a phase factor and conclude that the above indeed describes just one fermion propagating in each direction ; note that the surface - dependent chemical potential needs to be specified to determine the relative excitation energies of `` electron '' and `` hole '' propagating in a given direction .    hence the physical picture of the gapless edge of @xmath0 theory is as follows .",
    "the scalar and vector boson fields have a kinetic term from the bulk theory and a potential term from the surface theory , as in the chern - simons case .",
    "these combine to allow the faithful representation of fermi fields .",
    "the details of the surface determine both the velocities on each ray and the filling of the fermi states , i.e. , the chemical potential .",
    "it is well understood  @xcite that the remarkable power of bosonization for interacting systems in one dimension does not carry through straightforwardly to higher dimensions , essentially because the ray decomposition of the hilbert space ( a `` superselection rule '' ) is less useful for normal interactions .",
    "the @xmath0 theory of topological insulators predicts that interactions in the bulk still lead to massless dirac fermions via the bulk - edge connection derived in this section , and additional interactions occurring at the surface can be more naturally treated in the emergent fermionic variables than the bosonic ones .",
    "a future direction that we comment on briefly below is to consider the surfaces of fractional topological insulators in three dimensions .    , which is depicted as the red object .",

    "we have argued that a topological field theory of @xmath0 type is the effective theory of 2d and 3d topological insulators . for the 2d topological insulator ,",
    "this can be understood easily when one direction of spin is conserved and the system separates precisely into two copies of the quantum hall effect .",
    "the @xmath0 description of the 3d topological insulator is our main result ; perhaps the most surprising property is the emergence of surface dirac fermions from the particular kinetic term of scalar and vector bosonic fields that are forced to exist by the incomplete gauge invariance of @xmath0 theory .",
    "there are several obvious generalizations and future directions that can be pursued .",
    "considerable recent interest has gone into classifying topological insulators and superconductors with other symmetries than time - reversal , including their responses with gapped surfaces  @xcite , which are the analogues of the @xmath295 response in the conventional topological insulator .",
    "such systems may also be described by topological field theories , and it would be interesting to find the appropriate theories for those systems and the field - theory description of their defects and interfaces .",
    "we will focus in closing on one particular direction where we believe @xmath0 theory holds considerable promise .",
    "consider the chern - simons effective theory of the integer quantum hall effect . multiplying the coefficient of the chern - simons term by 3",
    "immediately gives the essential features of the _ fractional _ quantum hall effect state previously described microscopically by laughlin , including the braiding statistics and modified scaling dimension of the electron operator at the edge , which can be probed in tunneling experiments .    in the same way",
    ", we can obtain an effective theory for potential fractional 3d topological insulators by modifying the coefficient of the @xmath0 term .",
    "it should be stated from the outset that there is not yet a microscopic parent hamiltonian for a 3d fractional topological insulator .",
    "recent constructions of effective descriptions of 3d fractional topological insulators have been based on `` parton '' ideas : the electron fractionalizes into a combination of other particles , one of which ( a neutral spinon  @xcite or a fractionally charged object  @xcite ) then forms a topological insulator state .",
    "the @xmath0 theory presented here leads to a picture of 3d fractional topological insulators that appears somewhat different .",
    "changing the coefficient of the braiding term to another of the set of possible values  @xcite leads to fractional statistics between point - like and line - like objects . for a single pair of fields @xmath296 , gapped surfaces will have surface quantum hall layers of hall conductance @xmath297 , where the first is the `` integer '' topological insulator studied in this paper and all surface hall conductances are ambiguous by an integer .",
    "the most interesting aspect of such a fractional topological insulator might be its gapless surface theory .",
    "each 1d ray in the tomographic representation is now a pair of chiral luttinger liquids with renormalized scaling dimension of the electron operator , i.e. , essentially the effective theory discussed previously  @xcite for the edge of a 2d fractional topological insulator .",
    "the 2d surface state formed from the collection of such rays would be an unusual non - fermi - liquid state worthy of future study . leaving this fractional case aside",
    ", we can conclude from the results in this paper that @xmath0 theory can describe the universal physics of the currently extant topological insulators just as chern - simons theory captures the universal physics of quantum hall states ."
