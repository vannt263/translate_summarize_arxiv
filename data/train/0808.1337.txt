    "formation and evolution of galaxies and its dependence on the environment , e.g. , the formation of large - scale structure , are fundamental problems of the modern cosmology . studying the evolution of the clustering of galaxies is useful to understand the evolution of galaxies and that of large - scale structures .",

    "galaxies selected from optical observations are considered to trace the distribution of underlying dark matter halos ( verde et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , the strength of the clustering depends on properties of galaxy populations : e.g. , luminosity ( zehavi et al . 2005 ) , color or spectral type ( zehavi et al . 2002 ) , and stellar mass ( li et al .",

    "the relative bias at the low - luminosity end is smaller than the tegmark s relation in zehavi et al .",
    "therefore the relative bias of low - luminosity galaxies is still controversial .",
    "recently , the dependence of clustering on the luminosity is studied up to @xmath13 from the vimos - vlt deep survey ( marinoni et al .",

    "brighter galaxies are more strongly clustered than low luminosity galaxies and the dependence of relative bias on the luminosity at @xmath14 is in agreement with that in the local universe ( marinoni et al .",
    "the observed decreasing of the clustering strength is consistent with simple gravitational growth picture ( meneux et al .",

    "this fact implies that the h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath2 exist in the same environment where the h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath1 exist . if we assume the gravitational growth of dark matter halos to @xmath128 , the correlation length of this kind of galaxies evolve to @xmath129 mpc .",
