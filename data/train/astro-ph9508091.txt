    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) continue to confound astrophysicists nearly a quarter century after their discovery @xcite . before the launch of cgro , most scientists thought that grbs came from magnetic neutron stars residing in a thick disk ( having a scale height of up to @xmath4 2 kpc ) in the milky way @xcite .",
    "the data gathered by batse showed the existence of a rollover in the cumulative brightness distribution of grbs and that the sky distribution of even faint grbs is consistent with isotropy @xcite .",
    "this rules out a thick galactic disk source population .",
    "consequently , the primary impact of the batse results has been to intensify debate about whether the bursts are galactic or cosmological in origin .",
    "galactic models attribute the bursts primarily to high - velocity neutron stars in an extended galactic halo , which must reach one fourth or more of the distance to m31 ( @xmath5 kpc ) in order to avoid any discernible anisotropy @xcite .",
    "cosmological models place the grb sources at distances @xmath6 gpc , corresponding to redshifts @xmath7 .",
    "a source population at such large distances naturally produces an isotropic distribution of bursts on the sky , and the expansion of the universe or source evolution can reproduce the observed rollover in the cumulative brightness distribution @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite have revolutionized our understanding of the birth velocities of radio pulsars .",
    "they show that a substantial fraction of neutron stars have velocities that are high enough to produce an extended halo around the milky way like that required by galactic halo models of grbs @xcite .",
    "podsiadlowski , rees , and ruderman @xcite have carried out pioneering calculations of the spatial distribution expected for high - velocity neutron stars born in the galactic disk .",
    "they consider the effects of a non - spherical halo potential and of m31 , but neglect the effects of the galactic disk , which we find is also important .",
    "we have calculated detailed models of the spatial distribution expected for a population of high - velocity neutron stars born in the galactic disk and moving in a galactic potential that includes the bulge , disk , and a dark matter halo .",
    "we use the mass distribution and potential given by kuijken and gilmore @xcite which includes a disk , a bulge , and a dark matter halo .",
    "the densities of the disk and of the halo are @xmath8^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the circular velocity @xmath9 and the galactic disk lead to characteristic angular anisotropies as a function of burst brightness which provide a signature , and therefore a test , of high - velocity neutron star models .",
    "prolate or oblate dark matter halos also produce other angular anisotropies as a function of burst brightness which may provide a signature of such models @xcite .",
    "we assume that neutron stars are born with the circular velocity @xmath10 of the galactic disk .",
    "given that current knowledge of the distribution of initial kick velocities is uncertain , we adopt a green - function approach : we calculate the spatial distribution of neutron stars for a set of kick velocities ( e.g. , @xmath11  ) .",
    "we follow the resulting orbits for up to @xmath12 years .    in our initial calculations , we assume that the bursts are standard candles , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "we parameterize the burst - active phase by a turn - on age @xmath14 and a duration @xmath15 , and assume that the rate of bursting is constant throughout the burst - active phase .",
    "the high - velocity neutron star model then has four parameters : @xmath16 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the batse sampling depth @xmath17 .    [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]",
    "we compare the models with a carefully - selected data set that is self - consistent .",
    "we use only bursts that trigger on the 1024  ms timescale because we require that all bursts lie above the counts threshold in one trigger timescale ; the 1024  ms timescale yields the largest sampling depth , and therefore imposes the strongest constraint on models , of the three batse trigger timescales .",
    "we adopt @xmath18 , the peak flux in 1024  ms , as our measure of burst brightness .",
    "we therefore include only bursts which have a @xmath18 and @xmath19  ms .",
    "we consider only bursts with @xmath20  photons  @xmath21  s@xmath22 in order to avoid threshold effects @xcite .",
    "we also exclude overwriting bursts , because the threshold is much higher for these bursts , and maxbc bursts , because they have unknown positional errors .",
    "the 2b catalogue contains 285 bursts satisfying the above criteria .",
    "this set of bursts has galactic dipole and quadrupole moments @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , compared to the values @xmath25 , and @xmath26 expected for a uniform sky distribution , taking into account the batse sky exposure .    as a first step in testing the viability of galactic halo models ,",
    "we have compared the galactic dipole and quadrupole moments , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , of the angular distribution of bursts for the model with those for the above set of bursts , using @xmath29 .",
    "we have also compared the peak flux distribution for the model with that for the above set of bursts , using the ks test .",
    "these comparisons do _ not _ provide estimates of model parameters ( i.e. , they do not yield parameter confidence regions ) , but are meant only to be a rough  goodness - of - fit \" guide to models which should be tested using a more rigorous approach like the maximum likelihood method .",
    "as an illustrative example , we show in figure  1 the results for a galactic halo model in which neutron stars are born with a uniform single velocity @xmath30  and the burst - active phase has an initial burst rate @xmath31 and lasting @xmath32 million years .",
    "figure 2 shows the sky distribution of 285 bursts drawn randomly from the angular distribution expected for the model with @xmath33  myrs , and @xmath34  kpc .",
    "comparisons of this kind show that the high - velocity neutron star model can reproduce the peak flux and angular distributions of the bursts in the batse 2b catalogue for neutron star kick velocities @xmath35  , burst turn - on ages @xmath36  million years , and batse sampling depths @xmath37  kpc @xmath38  kpc .",
    "moreover , comparisons of this kind show that there is a large region of parameter space in which these models can reproduce the angular distribution of the bursts in the preliminary batse  3b catalogue .    in high - velocity neutron star models ,",
    "the slope of the cumulative peak flux distribution for the brightest batse bursts and the pvo bursts reflects the space density of the relatively small fraction of burst sources in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the nearness of the observed slope of the cumulative peak flux distribution of these bursts to -3/2 , the value expected for a uniform spatial distribution of sources which emit bursts that are  standard candles , \" must be considered a coincidence in the high - velocity neutron star model . however , a spread in neutron star kick velocities , in neutron star ages at which bursting behavior begins , or in the burst luminosity function tends to produce a cumulative peak flux distribution with a slope of -3/2 ; beaming of bursts along the direction of motion of the source or evolution of the rate of bursting as a function of age also tends to produce a slope of -3/2 .",
    "we find that there are many combinations of these factors which successfully reproduce the slope of the batse plus pvo peak flux distribution .",
    "for example , a model in which the burst luminosity function is a log normal distribution with a fwhm of a factor of @xmath39 and the burst - active phase has an abrupt (  heaviside function \" ) turn - on , one in which the kick velocities are distributed between @xmath40 and @xmath41  km  s@xmath22 and the burst - active phase initially has a burst rate @xmath42 , or one in which the burst - active phase initially has a burst rate @xmath43 work equally well .",
    "figure  1d compares the peak flux distribution for the last model and the batse+pvo peak flux distribution .",
    "m31 provides a strong constraint on the batse sampling distance @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the effects of m31 within the framework of the high - velocity neutron star model described above by including the distortion of the galactic halo potential due to m31 and the burst sources emanating from m31 .",
    "we find that for such models m31 imposes a limit on the batse sampling distance @xmath45  kpc , even if the bursting activity of neutron stars lasts for more than @xmath46 years @xcite ."
