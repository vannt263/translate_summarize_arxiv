    "in the study of quantum communication and quantum computation , spin chains and general spin networks are simple but very useful models to approximate physical systems  @xcite , including molecules in nmr experiments  @xcite and ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite . in the latter case",
    "it has been demonstrated experimentally that single and two - qubit gates can be implemented by controlling the external magnetic field , thus realizing universal quantum computation ( qc )  @xcite .",
    "universality is the capability of generating all unitary computational gates , which in the language of control theory is equivalent to system controllability , i.e. , the capability to generate the lie algebra of the unitary ( or special unitary ) group using both the system hamiltonian and the available control hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "controllability is an important criterion for assessing a system s capability for quantum information processing and many other applications of quantum control  @xcite . in principle",
    ", controllability can be verified by explicitly computing the dimension of the lie algebra , but such computations quickly become intractable as the dimension of the system increases . therefore ,",
    "alternative controllability conditions are needed , and many of these have been studied and derived for spin networks of various couplings and topologies  @xcite .",
    "most of the early results characterize conditions for full controllability on the whole hilbert space , and often a surprisingly small number of controls is necessary . in recent",
    "work it was shown that two independent local controls acting on the first spin suffice for full controllability for spin chains with coupling of heisenberg type  @xcite , while chains with xx - coupling control of at least the first two qubits is required @xcite .    alternatively",
    ", we would like to know what interesting tasks we can still perform given certain limited hamiltonian resources .",
    "these questions are practically important , because in many real physical systems there are limitations on the hamiltonian that can be implemented , and the quantum dynamics may be restricted to a subspace of the full hilbert space  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we study this subspace controllability problem .",
    "specifically , for any spin-@xmath3 network with coupling of xxz - type subject to @xmath1-directional magnetic control fields , the hilbert space of the system always decomposes into so - called excitation subspaces , which remain invariant under the dynamical evolution  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , unlike in previous work on restricted local control , which has usually focused on control of first the spin , we explicitly study the effect of the position of the controlled node on the controllability on the single excitation subspace .",
    "we find a surprising relationship between actuator placement , controllability and dynamical _ symmetries _ of the system .",
    "symmetry is an important concept and a powerful tool in physics  @xcite .",
    "dynamical symmetries provide an alternative perspective to the controllability problem , implying non - controllability , and are of interest as characterizing symmetries is usually easier than calculating the dynamical lie algebra .",
    "this has been explored in several works on controllability of spin chains and networks  @xcite . in our case",
    "we are able to fully characterize all possible dynamical symmetries for a general xxz - chain with local @xmath1-control of a single spin in the single excitation subspace with the aid of the bethe ansatz  @xcite . while dynamical symmetries imply that the system is not controllable , lack of symmetry does not always imply controllability .",
    "this raises the question under which conditions the converse holds , i.e. , lack of symmetry implies controllability  @xcite .",
    "we show that for common models such as xx and heisenberg chains and some branched networks lack of symmetry is not only a necessary but also a sufficient condition for controllability .",
    "* intrinsic hamiltonian : * the hamiltonian of a network of @xmath4 spin-@xmath3 particles with xxz coupling is of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the standard pauli operators and @xmath7 denotes the @xmath4-fold tensor product whose @xmath8th factor is @xmath9 , all others being the identity @xmath10 . the dimensionless constant @xmath11 determines the type of coupling such as heisenberg ( @xmath12 ) , xx ( @xmath13 ) or dipole ( @xmath14 ) coupling .",
    "the constants @xmath15 determine the coupling strengths between nodes @xmath16 and @xmath8 in the network .",

    "the corresponding control hamiltonian is @xmath22 neglecting dissipation , the dynamical evolution of the network subject to a time - varying control field @xmath23 , representing the magnitude of the magnetic field applied to node @xmath24 , is governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath25.\\ ] ]    * symmetries : * following the definitions given in  @xcite , a controlled spin network with hamiltonian @xmath26 is said to have an _ external _ or _ commutation symmetry _ if there is a hermitian matrix @xmath27 which commutes with both hamiltonians , i.e. , @xmath28=[h_c , s]=0 $ ] .",
    "the existence of such a symmetry operator implies that the hamiltonians @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be simultaneously block - diagonalized , and the hilbert space decomposed into smaller invariant subspaces corresponding to the eigenspaces of the symmetry operator @xmath27 .",
    "the system hamiltonian of an xxz spin network always commutes with the total spin operator @xmath31 , @xmath32=0 $ ] , as does any control hamiltonian of the form @xmath33 , and thus any xxz spin network with only controls of this type always has this external symmetry .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath34 has @xmath35 distinct eigenvalues , ranging from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , corresponding to the possible different numbers of excitations in the network , and hence we have @xmath35 invariant subspaces .",
    "c         +         +         +        another common type of external symmetry is _ permutation symmetry_. a non - identity member of the permutation group @xmath38 is a of the _ controlled network _ if both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are invariant under the permutation @xmath38 of the spins . for a single - node control this means in particular that the permutation must fix the controlled node .",
    "the permutation @xmath38 induces a permutation operator @xmath39 which commutes with both the intrinsic and control hamiltonians and hence defines an external symmetry . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] there are permutation symmetries in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) but not in ( d ) .",

    "the existence of external symmetries immediately implies that the system is not controllable on the full hilbert space @xmath40 , i.e. , the dynamical lie algebra @xmath41 generated by @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a proper sub - algebra of @xmath44   is @xmath45 and the system is controllable on the entire hilbert space if @xmath46 or @xmath47  @xcite . ] .",
    "this is easy to see as the existence of an external symmetry @xmath27 means that the system and control hamiltonians @xmath29 and @xmath30 are simultaneously blockdiagonalizable and therefore can not generate @xmath48 or @xmath49 . specifically ,",
    "if the hilbert space decomposes , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 are invariant subspaces , then the dynamical lie algebra generated must be a subalgebra of @xmath52 .",
    "the system may still be controllable on one or more of the subspace @xmath51 of @xmath40 , however , if the dynamical lie algebra on the subspace @xmath51 is equal to @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "this is the notion of controllability we are interested in here , in particular the controllability of the system on the single excitation subspace @xmath55 with respect to the total excitation ( symmetry ) operator @xmath34 .",
    "denoting the spin-@xmath3 excitation basis vectors by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the single excitation subspace @xmath55 is spanned by the @xmath4 basis vectors : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , which we can denote by @xmath62 , for simplicity .",
    "we can define a basis for the @xmath63 antisymmetric matrices as follows : @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "restricted to @xmath55 , the hamiltonians @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by the @xmath63 matrices    [ eqn : xxz1 ] @xmath66    where @xmath67 is shorthand for @xmath68 here , and the diagonal elements are @xmath69 with @xmath70 , setting @xmath71 for convenience .",
    "for the special case of a uniformly coupled chain , @xmath72 , we obtain @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 , and thus up to a multiple of the identity we have @xmath77 @xmath78 is a diagonal matrix with ones everywhere except for the @xmath24 diagonal element , which is @xmath79 .",
    "subtracting again and changing sign we can equivalently take @xmath80 note that the addition of multiples of identity matrix to @xmath29 and @xmath30 does not change their commutation relations with the original hamiltonian , and hence the lie algebra generated by @xmath2 and @xmath78 differs from the lie algebra generated by the original hamiltonians at most by the identity @xmath10 .    in the following , let @xmath41 denote the dynamical lie algebra generated by @xmath2 and @xmath78 . if @xmath81 or @xmath82 then @xmath83 or @xmath48 and the system is controllable on @xmath55 .",
    "the generators @xmath84 defined above form a natural basis for the lie algebra @xmath85 , and if we can generate them from @xmath86 and @xmath87 , then @xmath88 and the system is controllable . we shall also use the following commutation relations : @xmath89       & = y_{jk}\\\\ [ y_{jk},z_k ]       & = -x_{jk}\\\\ [ x_{jk},x_{k\\ell}]&= y_{j\\ell}\\\\ [ x_{jk},y_{k\\ell}]&=-x_{j\\ell}\\\\ [ x_{jk},y_{jk } ]    & = 2(z_j - z_k)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , to show controllability it suffices to show that we can generate all @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 .    as noted above , permutation symmetries commute with the total spin operator @xmath34 and therefore induce symmetries on all eigenspaces of @xmath34 , including @xmath55 .",
    "thus , for the xxz networks shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we can immediately conclude that the system is not controllable on any excitation subspace ( except the trivial ones @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath37 ) if ( a ) we control the middle spin , ( b ) we control any spin outside the two equal - length branches , and ( c ) we control any spin on the ring . however , permutation symmetries are not the only possible symmetries , especially on @xmath55 .",
    "* example : * for an xx chain ( @xmath13 ) of length @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we find that both @xmath2 and @xmath78 , restricted to the single excitation subspace , commute with @xmath95 which is not a permutation symmetry .",
    "we can indeed verify that the dimension of the lie algebra is @xmath96 , i.e. , the system is not controllable on @xmath55 , and the restrictions of @xmath2 and @xmath78 to @xmath55 can be simultaneously block - diagonalized .",
    "firstly , we can now show generally that for systems with a single - node @xmath1-type control , the external symmetries can be very easily characterized .",
    "[ thm : vk0 ] an xxz spin network with a single node control @xmath33 has external symmetries on @xmath55 if and only if @xmath2 has one or more eigenvectors @xmath97 with zero overlap with node @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath99 .    without loss of generality , we can choose a basis such that @xmath2 is diagonal .",
    "from favard s theorem  @xcite for tridiagonal matrices , we know that the eigenvalues of @xmath2 are distinct .",
    "in such a basis @xmath78 takes the form @xmath100 and setting @xmath101 $ ] gives @xmath102 , which shows that @xmath103 can vanish only if @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "if all @xmath106 then @xmath107 for all @xmath108 is only possible if @xmath105 for all @xmath108 , i.e. , if @xmath109 is a multiple of the identity , in which case there is no symmetry .",
    "thus a symmetry exists if and only if @xmath104 for some @xmath108 , which is equivalent to @xmath110 for some @xmath24 , i.e. , the existence of an eigenvector @xmath111 that has zero overlap with the controlled node .",
    "@xcite found a similar characterization in the setting of control by relaxation , and @xcite showed the existence of external symmetries to be equivalent to the existence of eigenstates of the system hamiltonian that have no overlap with the pendant vertex for spin networks with a pendant - type control .",
    "we shall refer to systems with no external or commutation symmetries as _",
    "indecomposable_. note that spin networks given by coupling graphs with multiple disjoint components are always decomposable as are systems with permutation symmetries , but as we have seen , these are by no means the only external symmetries the system might have .",
    "external symmetries imply that the hilbert space can be written as a direct sum of subspaces that are invariant under the dynamics .",
    "assuming we have found all external symmetries and decomposed the hilbert space into invariant subspaces that are not further reducible , the dynamics on each invariant subspaces can be subject to _ internal lie group symmetries _ , characterized by the existence of a _ unitary _ or _",
    "anti - unitary _",
    "operator @xmath27 such that @xmath112 where @xmath2 and @xmath78 are required to be trace - zero and @xmath113 denotes the transpose of @xmath114 .",
    "these internal symmetries can be divided into orthogonal and symplectic symmetries , and the existence of such a symmetry implies that the dynamical lie algebra @xmath41 generated by @xmath2 and @xmath78 is a subalgebra of @xmath115 or @xmath116 , respectively , and thus the system is again not controllable on the respective subspace . for spin networks with a particular single controlled coupling ( a _ pendant control _ ) it was recently found that internal symmetries on the single excitation subspace @xmath55 are of orthogonal type and related to the existence of a bipartite structure of the network  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , internal symmetries never occur for xxz spin networks with single - node @xmath1-controls .",
    "an indecomposable xxz network with a single - node z - control @xmath87 does not permit internal symmetries on @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath117 for @xmath118 , be the zero - trace versions of the hamiltonians @xmath2 and @xmath78 .",
    "we need to show there is no internal symmetry between @xmath119 and @xmath120 . as our hamiltonians",
    "are both real - symmetric the internal symmetry condition can be simplified @xmath121 we see that when @xmath122 is diagonal , @xmath123 , the latter condition is equivalent to @xmath124 , which implies @xmath125 unless @xmath126 . in particular , if @xmath127 then we have @xmath128 and @xmath129 for @xmath130 and thus the sum of any two diagonal elements of @xmath122 never vanishes .",
    "thus , remarkably for this type of control , we only need to consider external symmetries , which we shall refer to simply as symmetries in the following .",
    "in fact , the proof of the previous theorem shows that a decomposable spin network with @xmath1-controls admits internal symmetries on the single excitation subspace if only if @xmath4 is even and we collectively control exactly half of all nodes , in which case @xmath122 will contain equal numbers of @xmath131 and @xmath79 entries , which can cancel .",
    "[ thm : z1_control ] an xxz chain with arbitrary coupling strengths with a single z control at the end node is controllable on the single - excitation subspace @xmath55 .    to show controllability we calculate the dynamical lie algebra @xmath41 generated by @xmath132 and @xmath133 , noting that the hamiltonians take the form  ( [ eqn : xxz1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : xxz - h1 ] ) with @xmath134 for any @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "using these generators we can define a reduced system generated by @xmath138 and @xmath139 with @xmath140 which represents an xxz chain of length @xmath141 . by the same procedure as above",
    ", we can now generate @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 ; iterating the procedure @xmath145 times , we can generate @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath146 for @xmath92 , i.e. , all the generators corresponding to the simple roots of the lie algebra @xmath49 .",

    "suppose we have a eigenvector @xmath147 of @xmath2 with @xmath148",
    ". then @xmath149 gives @xmath150 which in turn implies @xmath151 , i.e. @xmath152 . thus any eigenvector of @xmath2 can not be zero at its first entry , i.e. , there is no external symmetry .",

    "moreover , from @xmath163 $ ] we can get @xmath164 and we get @xmath165 . hence , we find the following rule : starting from @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , we can generate @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "then , starting from @xmath162 , @xmath165 , and @xmath164 , we can analogously generate @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 . repeating this process",

    "based on these results one might conjecture that we always have subspace controllability , at least for inhomogeneous chains , regardless of which node we control .",
    "but this is not the case , and in fact some symmetries are extremely robust even in the presence of inhomogeneity .",

    "even_.    the hamiltonian of xx chain reduces to @xmath174 favard s theorem  @xcite for tridiagonal matrices guarantees that @xmath2 has @xmath4 distinct eigenvalues @xmath175 with corresponding eigenvectors @xmath176 satisfying @xmath177 where the polynomial @xmath178 is determined by the recurrence relation : @xmath179 for @xmath180 and @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",

    "in this work we have studied symmetries and controllability of xxz spin networks subject to local z - controls on the single excitation subspace . external symmetries for such systems can be easily characterized : such symmetries exist if and only if there are eigenstates of the system hamiltonian that have no overlap with the control node . if no such symmetries exist then the system is indecomposable . unlike systems where we control the coupling between two spins ( or an edge in the associated graph of the spin network ) ,",
    "indecomposable systems which have @xmath1-controls applied to one or more spins have internal lie algebra symmetries only in very exceptional cases .    for linear xxz chains",
    "we have further characterized all possible values of @xmath11 that allow the system to have external symmetries on the single excitation subspace .",
    "we find that there are at most countably many values of @xmath11 which permit any external symmetries , i.e.  for a generic @xmath11 there will be no symmetries , and we expect the system to be controllable for any local z control .",
    "however , for the values of @xmath11 that are most relevant in real physical systems : @xmath13 for xx coupling , @xmath12 for heisenberg coupling and @xmath14 for dipole coupling , there are symmetries in many cases . the existence or absence of symmetries depends on the position of the controlled node in the chain relative to the length of the chain and the type of coupling in a very peculiar manner .",
    "this shows that the choice of controlled node  or the placement of the `` actuator '' in control terminology  is very significant .    for chains with non - uniform coupling strengths , we find that the inhomogeneity usually breaks symmetries which are present for the uniformly - coupled case with the same topology , as one might expect . surprisingly however , there are certain symmetries which are robust even in the presence of inhomogeneities .",
    "absence of symmetries is a necessary condition for controllability . in many cases it also appears to be a sufficient condition but",
    "there are examples of systems without symmetries that are not controllable .",
    "we have shown that for uniform xx and heisenberg chains , lack of symmetry is the necessary and sufficient condition for the system s controllability on @xmath55 .",
    "finally , we have shown how to apply the techniques used to establish controllabity for spin chains to more complex networks such as branched networks .",
    "we have characterized the possible symmetries and propose a conjecture of the controllability condition .",
    "similar techniques could be applied to discuss the more complex spin networks , as well as the relationship between symmetry , controllability and actuator placement in other excitation subspaces .",
