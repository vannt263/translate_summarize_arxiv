    "thanks to the recent works of schramm , sheffield , dubdat , miller ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , we know that many structures built using schramm s sle curves can be naturally coupled with the planar gaussian free field ( gff ) . for instance , even though the gff is not a continuous function , sle@xmath0 and the conformal loop ensemble cle@xmath0 can be viewed as `` level lines '' of the gff . in these couplings , the notion of _ local sets of the gff _ and their properties turn out to be instrumental .",
    "this general abstract concept appears already in the study of markov random field in the 70s and 80s ( see in particular @xcite ) and can be viewed as the natural generalization of stopping times for multidimensional time .",
    "more precisely , a random set @xmath1 coupled with a ( zero - boundary ) gff in a planar domain @xmath2 is said to be a local set for this gff , if the conditional distribution of the gff in @xmath3 given @xmath1 has the law of the sum of a ( conditionally ) independent gff @xmath4 in @xmath3 with a random harmonic function @xmath5 defined in @xmath3 . this harmonic function can be interpreted as the harmonic extension to @xmath3 of the values of the gff on @xmath6 .    in the present paper",
    ", we are interested in a special type of local sets that we call _ bounded type thin local sets _ ( or btls ) .",
    "our definition of btls imposes three type of conditions , on top of being local sets :    1 .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath7 such that almost surely , @xmath8 in the complement of @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   the set @xmath1 is a thin local set in the sense defined in @xcite .",
    "this means that the harmonic function @xmath5 carries itself also all the information about the gff also on @xmath1 , in the sense that for any smooth test function @xmath9 , the random variable @xmath10 is almost surely equal to @xmath11 .",
    "3 .   almost surely ,",
    "each connected component of @xmath1 that does not intersect @xmath12 has a neighborhood that does intersect no other connected component of @xmath1 .",
    "if the set @xmath1 is a btls with the constant @xmath7 in the first condition , we say that it is a @xmath7-btls .",
    "the first two conditions are the most important ones .",
    "the first condition is of course highly non - trivial .",
    "notice that a deterministic non - polar set is not a btls because the corresponding harmonic function is not bounded , so that a non - empty btls is necessarily random .",
    "as we shall see , the second condition can be understood as a condition on the size of the set @xmath1 ( it can not be too large ) and can be compared in the previous analogy between local sets and stopping times to requiring stopping times to be uniformly integrable .",
    "the third condition implies in particular that @xmath1 has only countably many connected components that do not intersect @xmath12 .",
    "this is somewhat restrictive as there exist totally disconnected sets cantor sets @xmath1 that are non - polar for the brownian motion ( for instance a cantor set with hausdorff dimension in @xmath13 ) , and can therefore have a non - negligible boundary effect for the gff .",
    "we however believe that this third condition is not essential and could be disposed of ( ie .",
    "all statements would still hold without this condition ) , and we comment on this at the end of the paper .",
    "we remark that the precise choice of definitions is not that important here .",
    "we see , in fact , that the combination of these three conditions implies stronger statements . for instance , the ( upper ) minkowski dimension of such a @xmath7-btls @xmath1 is necessarily bounded by some constant @xmath14 that is smaller than 2 ( and this implies the second condition ) , and that @xmath15 has almost surely only one connected component ( which implies the third condition ) .",
    "non - trivial btls do exist , and the main examples are provided by sle@xmath0 , cle@xmath0 and their variants ( for their natural coupling with the gff ) as shown in @xcite . in this paper , among other things , we prove that any btls @xmath1 is contained in a nested version of cle@xmath0 and that @xmath16 is necessarily connected . from our proofs",
    "it also follows that the cle@xmath0 and its various generalizations are deterministic functions of the gff . keeping the stopping time analogy in mind , one can compare these results with the following feature of one - dimensional brownian motion @xmath17 started from the origin : if @xmath18 is a stopping time with respect to the filtration of @xmath17 such @xmath19 almost surely , then either @xmath20 almost surely , or @xmath18 is not uniformly integrable . in other words ,",
    "the cle@xmath0 and its nested versions and variants are the field analogues of one - dimensional exit times of intervals .",
    "one important general property of local sets , shown in @xcite and used extensively in @xcite , is that when @xmath1 and @xmath17 are two local sets coupled with the same gff , in such a way that @xmath1 and @xmath17 are conditionally independent given the gff , then their union @xmath21 is also a local set .",
    "it seems quite natural to expect that it should be possible to describe the harmonic function @xmath22 simply in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath23 , but deriving a general result in this direction appears to be , somewhat surprisingly , tricky .",
    "the present approach provides a way to obtain results in this direction in the case of btls : we shall see that the union of two btlss is always a btls .",
    "we plan to generalize in @xcite some features of our approach to the imaginary geometry setting , and hope that this might be of some help to enlighten some of the technical issues dealt with in @xcite .",
    "we now state more precisely some of the results that we shall derive .",
    "all of the results we state in this section hold for a simply connected domain @xmath2 .",
    "let us first briefly recall some features of the coupling between cle@xmath0 and gff in such a domain . using a branching - tree variant of sle@xmath0 introduced by sheffield in @xcite , it is possible to define a certain random conformally invariant family of marked open sets @xmath24 , where the @xmath25 s form a disjoint family of open subsets of the upper half - plane , and the marks @xmath26 belong to @xmath27 .",
    "the complement @xmath1 of @xmath28 is called a cle@xmath0 carpet ( see figure [ figcle4 ] ) and its minkowski dimension is in fact almost surely equal to @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) . as pointed out by miller and sheffield @xcite ,",
    "the set @xmath1 can be coupled with the gff as a btls in a way that @xmath5 is constant and equal to @xmath30 in each @xmath25 .",
    "the set in black represents the cle@xmath0 carpet and the white holes are the open sets @xmath25 . , width=297 ]    simulation by david b. wilson .    by the property of local sets , conditionally on @xmath1 , the field @xmath31 consists of independent gaussian free fields @xmath32 inside each @xmath25 .",
    "we can then iterate the same construction independently for each of these gffs @xmath32 , using a cle@xmath0 in each @xmath25 . in this way , for each given @xmath33 , if we define @xmath34 to be the open set @xmath25 that contains @xmath35 ( for each fixed @xmath35 , this set almost surely exists ) and set @xmath36 , we then get a second set @xmath37 corresponding to the nested cle@xmath0 in @xmath34 and a new mark @xmath38 . iterating the procedure , we obtain for each given @xmath35 , an almost surely decreasing sequence of open sets @xmath39 and a sequence of marks @xmath40 in @xmath41 . when @xmath42 , then @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 can be viewed as a constant function in @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , for each @xmath46 , the sequence @xmath47 is a simple random walk .    for each @xmath48 ,",
    "the complement @xmath49 of the union of all @xmath39 with @xmath50 is then a btls and the corresponding harmonic function @xmath51 is just @xmath52 .",
    "the set @xmath49 is called the nested cle@xmath0 of level @xmath48 ( we refer to it as cle@xmath53 in the sequel ) .",
    "it is in fact easy to see that one can recover the gff @xmath54 from the knowledge of all these @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( because for each smooth test function @xmath9 , the sequence @xmath57 converges to @xmath58 in @xmath59 ) .    for each integer @xmath60 , one can then define for each @xmath35 in @xmath61 , the random variable @xmath62 to be the smallest @xmath63 at which @xmath64 . as for each fixed @xmath35 ,",
    "the sequence @xmath65 is just a simple random walk , @xmath62 is almost surely finite .",
    "the complement @xmath66 of the union of all these @xmath67 for @xmath35 with rational coordinates defines a @xmath68-btls : indeed , the corresponding harmonic function is then constant in each connected component @xmath69 and takes values in @xmath70 , and we explain in section [ cle4 ] ) that the minkowski dimension of @xmath66 is almost surely bounded by @xmath71 which imply the thinness .",
    "we refer to this set",
    "@xmath66 as a cle@xmath72 ( mind that @xmath73 is in superscript , as opposed to cle@xmath74 , where we just iterated @xmath63 times the cle@xmath0 ) .",
    "a special case of our results is that this @xmath75 is the only btls with harmonic function taking its values in @xmath76 .",
    "more precisely :    [ cledesc ] suppose that @xmath1 is a btls coupled to the same gff as a cle@xmath72 , and such that the corresponding harmonic function @xmath5 takes values in @xmath77 .",
    "then , @xmath1 is almost surely equal to the cle@xmath72 .    in particular , for @xmath78 and taking @xmath1 to be another cle@xmath0 coupled with the same gff",
    ", this means that any two @xmath79 that are coupled with the same gff as local sets are almost surely identical .",
    "this btls approach therefore provides a rather short proof of the fact the first layer cle@xmath0 and all nested cle@xmath74 are deterministic functions of the gff ( hence , that the information provided by the collection of nested labelled cle@xmath74 s is equivalent to the information provided by the gff itself ) .",
    "this fact is not new and is due to miller and sheffield @xcite , who have outlined the proof in private discussions , presentations and talks ( and a paper in preparation ) .",
    "our proof follows a slightly different strategy than the one proposed by miller and sheffield , with a different angle , although the basic ingredients are very similar ( absolute continuity properties of the gff , basic properties of local sets and the fact that sle@xmath0 itself is a deterministic function of the gff ) .",
    "let us stress that here and in subsequent propositions , the condition of being thin is necessary .",
    "indeed , if we consider the union of a cle@xmath0 with , say , the component of its complement that contains the the origin , we still obtain a local set for which the corresponding harmonic function is in @xmath77 , yet it is almost surely clearly not contained in any of the @xmath75 .",
    "we also characterize all possible btls such that the harmonic function can take only two possible prescribed values , and study their properties :    [ cledesc2 ] let us consider @xmath80 .    1 .",
    "when @xmath81 , it is not possible to construct a btls @xmath1 with @xmath82 .",
    "when @xmath83 , it is possible to construct a btls @xmath84 coupled with a gff @xmath54 in such a way that @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , the sets @xmath84 are * unique in the sense that if @xmath86 is another btls coupled with the same @xmath54 , such that for all @xmath46 , @xmath87 almost surely , then @xmath88 almost surely . * measurable functions of the gff @xmath54 that they are coupled with .",
    "* monotonic in the following sense : if @xmath89 \\subset [ a ' , b']$ ] and @xmath80 with @xmath90 , then almost surely , @xmath91 .",
    "further information about the sets @xmath84 and their properties ( detailed construction , dimensions ) as well as some generalizations are discussed in section [ s6 ] .",
    "another type of result that we derive using similar ideas as in the proof of proposition [ cledesc ] goes as follows :    [ maxbtls ] if @xmath1 is a @xmath92-btls associated to the gff @xmath54 , @xmath1 is almost surely a subset of the @xmath93 associated to @xmath54 .",
    "notice that one would expect to conclude that @xmath94 in the proposition ( and this would mean that @xmath75 is maximal among all @xmath68-btls ) , but this seems to require some more technical work that we do not discuss in the present paper . as an immediate consequence , we see that the finite union of btls is almost surely contained in some @xmath75 for some given @xmath73 , and that it is again a btls .",
    "this type of facts helps to derive the above - mentioned fact :    [ propnodisconnection ] if @xmath1 is a btls , then @xmath16 is connected .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : we first recall some basic features about btls .",
    "then , we consider generalized level lines of the gff and discuss a useful result about their boundary hitting behaviour .",
    "thereafter , we recall features of the construction of the coupling of the gff with @xmath75 .",
    "this sets the stage for the proofs of the propositions involving cle@xmath72 .",
    "we then finally turn to proposition [ cledesc2 ] and the discussion about the dimension of the sets @xmath84 .",
    "[ s3 ] in this section , we quickly browse through basic definitions and properties of the gff and of bounded - type local sets .",
    "we only discuss items that are directly used in the current paper . for a more general discussion of local sets , thin local sets ( not necessarily of bounded type ) ,",
    "we refer to @xcite .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the set @xmath2 denotes an open planar domain with a non - empty and non - polar boundary . by conformal invariance",
    ", we can always assume that @xmath2 is a subset of the unit disc @xmath95 .",
    "the most general case that we work with are domains @xmath2 such that the complement of @xmath2 has at most countably many connected components with only finitely many components in each compact set and no complement being a singleton ( this is a non - trivial condition as it excludes for instance sets like @xmath96 , where @xmath97 $ ] is the middle cantor set ) .",
    "recall that by a theorem of he and schramm @xcite , such domains @xmath2 are known to be conformally equivalent to a circle domain ( i.e. to @xmath96 , where @xmath7 is a union of closed disjoint discs ) .",
    "recall that the ( zero boundary ) gaussian free field ( gff ) in a domain @xmath2 can be viewed as a centered gaussian process @xmath54 ( we also sometimes write @xmath98 when we the domain needs to be specified ) indexed by the set of continuous functions with compact support in @xmath2 , with covariance given by @xmath99   =   \\iint_{d\\times d } f(x ) g_d(x , y ) g(y ) { { d}}x { { d}}y\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the green s function ( with dirichlet boundary conditions ) in @xmath2 , normalized such that @xmath101 as @xmath102 . for this choice of normalization of @xmath103 ( and",
    "therefore of the gff ) , we set @xmath104 sometimes , other normalizations are used in the literature : if @xmath105 as @xmath102 , then @xmath106 should be taken to be @xmath107 . note that it is in fact possible and useful to define the random variable @xmath108 for any fixed borel measure @xmath109 , provided the energy @xmath110 is finite .    similarly to brownian motion , the gff can be also viewed as the gaussian measure associated to the dirichlet space @xmath111 , which is the closure of the set of smooth functions of compact support in @xmath2 with respect to the dirichlet norm @xmath112 the dirichlet space is also the cameron - martin space for the gff ; in particular the law of @xmath113 is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of @xmath54 whenever @xmath114 , and the radon - nikodym derivative is given by a constant multiple of @xmath115 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the covariance kernel of the gff blows up on the diagonal , which makes it impossible to view @xmath54 as a random function .",
    "it can , however , be shown that the gff has a version that lives in some space of generalized functions , what justifies the notation @xmath10 for @xmath54 acting on functions @xmath9 ( see for example @xcite ) . however , it is not possible to make sense of @xmath10 when @xmath116 is a the indicator function of an arbitrary random set @xmath1 .",
    "local sets form a class of random sets where this is ( in a sense ) possible :    consider a random triple @xmath117 , where @xmath54 is a gff in @xmath2 , @xmath1 is a random relatively closed subset of @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath3 is open ) and @xmath118 a random distribution that can be viewed as a harmonic function when restricted to @xmath3 .",
    "we say that @xmath1 is a local set for @xmath54 if conditionally on @xmath1 , @xmath119 is a gff in @xmath3 .",
    "notice that being a local set can also be seen as a property of the law of the couple @xmath120 , as one can recover @xmath118 as the conditional expectation of @xmath54 given @xmath1 .",
    "let us list a few properties of local sets ( see for instance @xcite for derivations and further properties ) :    [ bpls ] @xmath121    1 .",
    "any local set can be coupled in a unique way with a given gff : if two random triples @xmath117 and @xmath122 are both local couplings , then @xmath118 and @xmath123 are almost surely identical .",
    "2 .   when @xmath1 and @xmath17 are local sets coupled with the same gff @xmath54 , and that @xmath124 and @xmath125 are conditionally independent given @xmath54 , then @xmath21 is also a local set coupled with @xmath54 .",
    "we now define local sets of bounded type :    [ btlscnd ] consider a random relatively closed subset @xmath1 of @xmath2 ( i.e. so that @xmath3 is open ) and @xmath54 a gff defined on the same probability space .",
    "let @xmath126 , we say that @xmath1 is a @xmath7-btls if the following four conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "@xmath1 is a local set of @xmath54 .",
    "2 .   almost surely , @xmath127 in @xmath3 .",
    "3 .   almost surely ,",
    "each connected component of @xmath1 that does not intersect @xmath12 has a neighborhood that does intersect no other connected component of @xmath1 .",
    "4 .   @xmath1 is a thin local set in the sense defined in @xcite : for any smooth test function @xmath128 , the random variable @xmath10 is almost surely equal to @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a @xmath7-btls for some @xmath7 , we say that it is a btls .",
    "note also that it is in fact possible to remove all isolated points from a btls ( of which there are at most countably many because of the third property ) without changing the property of being btls .",
    "indeed , the bounded harmonic function @xmath5 can be extended to those points and a gff does not see polar sets .",
    "we therefore replace the third property by :    _ ( 3 ) _ : :    almost surely , @xmath1 contains no isolated points and each    connected component of @xmath1 that does not intersect    @xmath12 has a neighborhood that does intersect no    other connected component of @xmath1 .",
    "this reformulation will be handy to keep our statements simple .",
    "it is not hard to see that in the case where the harmonic function is bounded , the condition of being thin given above is equivalent to saying that for the upper dyadic approximation @xmath129_n$ ] of @xmath1 , and for any smooth test function @xmath9 , the sequence of random variables @xmath130_n})$ ] converges in probability to @xmath58 . from a borel - cantelli argument , one can moreover see that this equivalent condition is implied by ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath131 : :    the expected volume of the @xmath132-neighborhood of    @xmath1 decays like @xmath133    as @xmath134 .",
    "note that if @xmath1 and @xmath17 are two btls that are coupled with the same gff @xmath54 , and that are conditionally independent given @xmath54 , then we know by lemma [ bpls ] that @xmath21 is a local set .",
    "hence , in order to check that @xmath21 is a btls , we need to show it is thin and give an upper bound for the harmonic function @xmath22 .    it is not hard to derive the following related fact :    [ local subset ] let @xmath1 be a thin local set that satisfies the condition ( 3 ) of definition [ btlscnd ] , and let @xmath86 be a @xmath7-btls coupled with the same gff in such a way that @xmath135 almost surely .",
    "then @xmath1 is a @xmath7-btls .",
    "one just has to check that @xmath136 . for any smooth @xmath137 with compact support",

    "the claim now follows from jensen s inequality for conditional expectations .    after showing that any btls is contained in some cle@xmath144 and checked that cle@xmath72 satisfies indeed @xmath131",
    ", this lemma is used to show the union of any two btls is a again a btls .",
    "the following lemma is very useful in our proof of the fact that any btls is contained in some cle@xmath72 :    [ mes ] let @xmath1 and @xmath17 are two btls coupled to the same gff and suppose that almost surely , @xmath1 satisfies condition @xmath131 .",
    "then , if almost surely , for all @xmath145 , @xmath146 , we have that almost surely @xmath147 .",
    "first , let us briefly explain why the conditions on @xmath1 and @xmath17 imply that @xmath21 is a thin local set . we know that @xmath21 is local . to show that @xmath148 is thin , we use the equivalent condition mentioned above .",

    "hence , using the fact that @xmath170 , we conclude that for every open set , almost surely on the event @xmath166 , @xmath171 on @xmath172 .",
    "the same statement holds for @xmath161 instead of @xmath160 .",
    "therefore @xmath173 is polar in @xmath3 and condition ( 3 ) allows us to conclude .",
    "let us first recall some well - known features of the schramm - sheffield coupling of sle@xmath0 with the gff in the upper half - plane @xmath61 .",
    "consider the bounded harmonic function @xmath174 in the upper - half plane with boundary values @xmath175 on @xmath176 and @xmath177 on @xmath178 .",
    "suppose that @xmath179 is a random simple curve defined in the closed upper half - plane , such that @xmath180 , @xmath181 and the time @xmath182 is the ( possibly infinite ) smallest positive time @xmath183 at which @xmath184 .",
    "then , there exists a unique way to couple @xmath185 with a gff @xmath54 in such a way that the following property holds ( we state it in a somewhat strange way that will be easier to generalize ) :    @xmath186 : :    for all @xmath183 , the set    @xmath187 $ ] is a btls of the gff    @xmath54 , with harmonic function @xmath188 defined    as follows : @xmath189 is the unique bounded harmonic    function in @xmath190 $ ]    with boundary values @xmath175 on the left - hand side of    @xmath185 , @xmath191 on the right side of    @xmath185 , and with the same boundary values as    @xmath192 on @xmath176 and    @xmath178 .",
    "furthermore , this curve is then a sle@xmath0 ( and @xmath193 almost surely ) , and when one couples sle@xmath0 with a gff @xmath54 in this way , then the sle@xmath0 process is in fact a measurable function of the gff ( see @xcite for all these facts ) .",
    "this statement can be generalized to more general harmonic functions @xmath194 , which gives rise to sle@xmath195-type processes .",

    "let @xmath196 , where @xmath7 is a countable union of closed discs such that in any compact set there are only finitely many of them .",
    "consider a finite union @xmath197 of closed dyadic squares in @xmath2 with @xmath198 , and a harmonic function @xmath199 in @xmath2 such that @xmath199 extends continuously to an open neighborhood @xmath200 of @xmath201 in @xmath202 in such a way that @xmath203 on @xmath200 ( we then say that the boundary value of @xmath199 on @xmath201 is zero ) .    using absolute continuity properties of the gff , it is not hard to see that the gff @xmath54 and @xmath204 are mutually absolutely continuous , when restricted to @xmath197 ( the proof of the following lemma can be found for example in @xcite ) :    [ abscnty ] let @xmath54 be a ( zero boundary ) gff in @xmath2 and denote its law restricted to @xmath197 by @xmath205 .",

    "moreover the radial sle@xmath296 processes for different target points can be coupled together in a nice way .",
    "this target - invariance feature was first observed in @xcite , and is closely related to the decompositions of sle@xmath297 into sle@xmath0 `` excursions '' mentioned in ( 1 ) .",

    "however , using the previous observation about the relation between the excursions of @xmath17 and the intervals during which the sle@xmath297 traces a simple curve , we see that up to time @xmath336 the excursion intervals away from @xmath316 by the brownian motions used to generate the sle@xmath296 processes targeting @xmath35 and @xmath335 correspond to each other .",
    "the time - change between the two brownian motions can be calculated explicitly .",

    "the target - invariance property of sle@xmath296 leads to the construction of the radial sle@xmath297 branching - tree .",

    ", it is not obvious that the law of the obtained cle@xmath0 ( and its nested versions ) does not depend on the choice of the starting point ( here @xmath334 ) on @xmath350 ( ie . of the root of the exploration tree ) .",
    "however , propositions [ cledesc ] and [ cledesc2 ] provide one possible proof of the fact that this choice of starting point does not matter ( this is also explained in @xcite , using the loop - soup construction of @xcite ) .",
    "this justify a posteriori that when one iterates the cle@xmath0 in order to construct the nested versions , one does in fact not need to specify where to continue the exploration .    on the other hand , from this construction",
    "it is easy to estimate the expected area of the @xmath132-neighborhood of cle@xmath0 and to see that the upper minkowski dimension of cle@xmath0 is almost surely not greater than @xmath351 .",

    "it is enough to treat the case where @xmath35 is the origin in the unit dicc .",
    "but we can note that the conformal radius of @xmath308 ( in the sle@xmath297 ) is comparable to @xmath353 by koebe s @xmath354-theorem , and that the log - conformal radius of @xmath355 from the origin is just minus the exit time of @xmath343 by the brownian motion @xmath17 which is a well - understood random variable ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "hence , the asymptotic behavior as @xmath356 of the probability that @xmath357 can be estimated precisely .",

    "a similar argument then shows that the upper minkowski dimension of cle@xmath72 is not greater than @xmath361 ( the @xmath362 term is then just due to brownian scaling  the exit time of @xmath363 by brownian motion is equal in distribution to @xmath362 times the exit time of @xmath343 ) .      to explain the coupling cle@xmath0 with the gff",
    ", we can first describe the coupling of a single radial sle@xmath296 process with a gff .",
    "the whole coupling then follows iteratively from the strong markov property and from the branching tree procedure .",
    "the proof of the coupling of the radial sle@xmath297 follows the steps of the coupling of the usual sle@xmath0 with the gff , as explained for instance in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the following observations :    1 .",
    "the hadamard formula ( see for instance @xcite ) gives the time - evolution of the green s function under loewner flow : for any two points @xmath274 and @xmath364 in @xmath95 , the green s function @xmath365 evolves until @xmath366 according to @xmath367 where by @xmath340 we denote the poisson kernel in @xmath95 seen from @xmath35 and targeted at @xmath300 as before .",
    "the cross - variation @xmath368 between the two local martingales @xmath321 and @xmath369 is equal to @xmath370 , so that @xmath371 3",
    ".   we can interpret @xmath372 ( up to @xmath373 ) as the harmonic measure in @xmath308 seen from @xmath35 , of the boundary arc between the tip of the curve and the force point @xmath310 ( the sign of @xmath337 describes which of the two arcs one considers ) .",
    "one can the first couple the gff with the radial sle@xmath297 up to the first time at which it surrounds the origin , exactly following the arguments of @xcite .",
    "this defines a btls with harmonic function in @xmath374 . for those domains where the harmonic functions are zero",
    ", one can then continue the sle@xmath297 iteration targeting another well - chosen point in that domain and proceed .",
    "this radial construction is arguably also the easiest one to explain that in fact , conditionally on the cle@xmath0 , the labels @xmath26 are i.i.d .",
    "this is then just a consequence of the time - reversal of sle@xmath0 , so that changing the orientation of the quasi - loop that traces the boundary of @xmath25 corresponds to a measure - preserving transformation of the driving brownian motion ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we come back to this in paragraph [ commenting ] .",
    "we now derive proposition [ maxbtls ] , proposition [ cledesc ] and proposition [ propnodisconnection ] . in some sense , this section is the core of the present paper .    here",
    "@xmath2 always denote a simply connected planar domain with non - empty boundary ( so that the previous definition of cle@xmath0 makes sense ) .",
    "let us fix a point @xmath35 , and consider the radial sle@xmath297 process targeted at @xmath35 that is coupled with the field ( and with the cle@xmath375 ) as described before .",
    "if @xmath376 , then at some rational time ( for the radial sle s parametrization ) , this radial sle is drawing some piece of @xmath377 within @xmath344 .",
    "we therefore consider a fixed rational time @xmath378 , and consider the event @xmath379 that the radial sle@xmath297 process targeting @xmath35 , stopped at @xmath380 , has the following properties :    * it is tracing a loop . *",

    "hence , the domain that this generalized level line after closing itself is almost surely included inside @xmath344 . in particular , if it happens that this domain contains @xmath35 , then the connected component of the complement of @xmath388 that contains @xmath35 has @xmath389 as its outer boundary , and maybe some inner boundaries ( that are part of @xmath390  this can happen only if @xmath344 is not simply connected ) .",
    "importantly , the intersection of @xmath389 and @xmath390 is at most two points .",
    "as the maximum value of the @xmath391-circle average of the gff is of the order @xmath392 , these two intersection points can not influence the value of the harmonic function ( see @xcite for the precise statement and proof ) and thus , almost surely , the absolute value of the harmonic function corresponding to @xmath388 is bounded by @xmath393 .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to the case where @xmath394 .",
    "note that if for all rational @xmath378 , the stopped radial sle@xmath297 is either not in @xmath344 or not in the process of tracing the loop that constitute the outer boundary of @xmath395 , then it means that @xmath396 , so that in this case too , the harmonic function corresponding to @xmath397 is necessarily bounded , in absolute value , by @xmath393 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that @xmath388 is also a @xmath393-btls .",

    "in this section , we describe the class of btls such that the harmonic function can only take two prescribed possible values .",
    "in particular , we construct a collection of btls that are smaller than cle@xmath0 and determine for which values such btlss exist .",
    "some aspects of the following discussion are strongly related to the @xmath412 case of boundary conformal loop ensembles ( and their nesting ) introduced and studied in @xcite ( that was written up in parallel to the present paper ) for general @xmath413 .",
    "let us first describe in some detail one specific example .",
    "consider a gff in the unit disc and fix two boundary points , say @xmath414 and @xmath415 .",
    "consider the zero - level line of this gff .",
    "this is an sle@xmath416 from @xmath414 to @xmath415 that is coupled with the gff as a btls @xcite .",
    "it is known that this is a simple path @xmath185 from @xmath414 to @xmath415 in the closed disc , and it is easy to see that its minkowski dimension is almost surely smaller than some @xmath417 .",
    "moreover , it is also known that the sle@xmath416 is a deterministic function of the gff @xcite .",
    "the harmonic function @xmath418 associated to this curve is described as follows : @xmath419 is the union of countably many connected components @xmath420 , and a component lies either to the right or to the left of the curve ( if one views the curve as going from @xmath414 to @xmath415 ) . in each component @xmath421 ,",
    "the harmonic function has boundary conditions @xmath58 on @xmath422 and on @xmath423 , the boundary condition is @xmath106 or @xmath175 depending on whether @xmath421 is on the left or on the right of @xmath185 .    as inside each component",
    "@xmath421 have independent gff - s with boundary conditions , we can iterate : suppose for example that the @xmath421 lies to the right of @xmath185 , then , @xmath424 is divided into to arcs , one of which is an excursion of @xmath185 away from the @xmath12 , and the other one is a counter - clockwise arc from @xmath425 to @xmath426 of @xmath12 .",
    "we now define a sle@xmath427 process from @xmath425 to @xmath426 .",
    "this is again a simple curve , and can be coupled with the gff with boundary conditions @xmath5 in @xmath421 in such a way that the boundary conditions on its left are @xmath175 and on its right are @xmath106 .",
    "we proceed in a symmetric way in the connected components that lie above @xmath185 . in this way",
    ", we obtain a new btls ( by first sampling @xmath185 , and then one sle@xmath427 process in each @xmath421 ) , and harmonic functions defined via the boundary conditions as indicated in figure [ fig : firstiteration ] .",
    "the iteration then further proceeds by defining sle@xmath428 processes in each of the remaining connected components which have part of @xmath12 on their boundary .",
    "one then defines a second layer of loops and one proceeds iteratively .",
    "we then consider the closure @xmath429 of the union of all the traced level lines .",
    "clearly , after any finite number of iterations in the previous construction , one has a @xmath106-btls , and therefore a subset of the cle@xmath430 by our previous results .",
    "hence , @xmath1 is itself a subset of the cle@xmath430 and therefore a btls .",
    "it is also easy to see that a given point @xmath46 is almost surely contained in a loop cut out after finitely many iterations , so that the harmonic function associated to @xmath1 takes its values in @xmath431 .     and its boundary conditions on the left .",
    "the sle@xmath432 in the second layer on the right picture that creates loops with @xmath433 boundary conditions.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and its boundary conditions on the left .",
    "the sle@xmath432 in the second layer on the right picture that creates loops with @xmath433 boundary conditions.,title=\"fig : \" ]      * as opposed to the cle@xmath0 , the set @xmath429 is fairly skinny .",
    "indeed , it is just made out of the union of all sle@xmath0 type of paths .",
    "for instance , each excursion of @xmath185 away from @xmath350 is on the boundary between two connected components of @xmath429 ( one @xmath191 loop to its right and one @xmath175 loop to its left ) .",
    "this indicates that the minkowski dimension of @xmath429 should be @xmath434 ( we will come back to this later ) . *",
    "the set @xmath435 is the only btls with boundary values in @xmath436 .",
    "in fact , suppose that @xmath437 is another btls coupled with the same gff as @xmath429 , such that @xmath438 takes its values in @xmath431 and such that conditionally on @xmath54 , @xmath429 and @xmath437 are independent .",
    "then , one can loosely follow the strategy of the proof of proposition [ cledesc ] to conclude that @xmath439 almost surely . more precisely , consider again some @xmath440 and denote by @xmath344 the component of @xmath35 in @xmath441 .",
    "now , notice that almost surely no level line in the construction of the component of @xmath35 in @xmath442 can make an excursion inside of @xmath344 : indeed , consider for contradiction the first level line in the construction that enters @xmath344 .",
    "then one the one hand this level line can not exit @xmath344 on the boundary of @xmath437 . on the other hand it is also almost surely a simple path .",
    "thus , it can not exit @xmath344 at all and we obtain a contradiction .",
    "as this holds for a countable dense family of @xmath35 , we can again conclude from lemma [ mes ] that @xmath429 is the only @xmath106-btls with these properties .",
    "in particular its law does not depend on the arbitrary choice of the points @xmath274 and @xmath364 in the previous layered construction .",
    "furthermore , we note that , similarly to the construction of cle@xmath72 , we can iterate the construction of the set @xmath429 to construct a btls with harmonic function that takes its values in @xmath443 : indeed , we pick a countable number of dense @xmath46 and iterate the construction in the component containing @xmath35 until the boundary values are in @xmath444 . at each step in the construction",
    ", one has a @xmath445btls , and therefore in the limit , one still has a btls contained in cle@xmath430 .",
    "but from proposition [ cledesc ] it now follows that the obtained set is exactly the cle@xmath0 .",
    "this therefore provides an alternative construction of cle@xmath0 ( and of its iterated nested versions cle@xmath74 and cle@xmath72 ) that builds only on the coupling of the chordal sle@xmath446 and sle@xmath432 process with the gff .",
    "notice that in this case the measurability of the cle@xmath0 just follows from that of the respective sle@xmath447 and sle@xmath432 processes plus general properties of the local set and level lines .",
    "as we point out in section [ sdim ] , there is also a direct way to see that this set @xmath429 and its iterates are thin ( without using the relation to cle@xmath72 as we just did ) .",
    "hence , we indeed obtain a stand - alone construction of cle@xmath0 and of its properties .",
    "interestingly , we can not show that this construction gives the same law as cle@xmath0 without using the coupling with the gff .",
    "we first describe for any @xmath448 with @xmath449 , the construction of a btls @xmath450 such that the corresponding harmonic function takes its values in @xmath451 .",
    "this generalizes our previous constructions of @xmath452 and cle@xmath72 , that corresponds to @xmath453 .",
    "we then prove that there are no such btls when @xmath454 ( unless @xmath455 or @xmath456 are equal to @xmath58 , in which case one can take the empty set ) , and discuss the labels assigning to each component of @xmath457 its expected value .",

    "@xmath471 vs @xmath472 interfaces iteratively instead of @xmath175 vs. @xmath106 interfaces . exactly the same construction and the same arguments lead to the construction of a btls @xmath473 such that the corresponding harmonic function takes its values in @xmath474 .",
    "these sets are called the boundary conformal loop ensembles for @xmath412 in @xcite . notice that in these sets each interior boundary arc is shared by two components of the complement . * _ @xmath475 where @xmath476 is an integer _ : define @xmath477 such that there exists two non - negative integers @xmath478 with @xmath479 and @xmath480 .",
    "starting from @xmath473 we now iterate copies of @xmath481 ( resp . of @xmath482 ) in the connected components of the complement of @xmath483 depending on the value of the harmonic function . *",
    "_ general case with @xmath484 _",
    ": by symmetry , we can suppose that @xmath485 .",
    "define @xmath486 and @xmath487 such that @xmath488 and @xmath489 .",
    "note that @xmath490 and that @xmath491 . now consider a sample of @xmath492 . in the connected components where the harmonic function is @xmath456 , we stop . in those components where the harmonic function is @xmath493 ,",
    "we iterate copies of @xmath494 where @xmath495 . in this way",
    ", we obtain on the one hand connected components where the harmonic function is @xmath496 ( and we stop ) , and on the other hand , components where the harmonic function is @xmath497 . in the latter ,",
    "we iterate independent copies of @xmath498 , and we continue in this way . at each step of the iteration , one has a btls that is contained in a given cle@xmath72 for a fixed @xmath73 .",
    "if we continue the iteration around every point @xmath35 until the iteration stops , we define a btls @xmath450 such that the corresponding harmonic function takes values in @xmath499 .",
    "conformal invariance of the gff implies the conformal invariance of @xmath84 and thus we see that @xmath500 does not depend on @xmath46 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath501 , we therefore see that for all @xmath46 , @xmath502 as one might have expected .    to see that @xmath84 are the unique btls @xmath17 with @xmath503 , one can adapt the arguments that we used in the last subsection in the case where @xmath504 .",
    "thus , in order to complete the proof of part ( 2 ) of proposition [ cledesc2 ] , it remains to explain the monotonicity statement :    suppose @xmath505 \\subset [ -a ' , b']$ ] and @xmath80 with @xmath484 .",
    "starting with @xmath450 , and then sampling independent copies @xmath506 in all the connected components of its complement where the gff - boundary values are @xmath455 and independent copies of @xmath507 in the others , we obtain a btls with boundary values in @xmath508 . by uniqueness",
    "it follows that the obtained set is indeed @xmath509 and by construction it contains @xmath84 .",
    "let us now explain the proof of proposition [ cledesc2]-(1 ) : first , one can discard the case where @xmath496 and @xmath456 have the same sign because the mean value of the field has to remain @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath80 and @xmath511 , suppose for contradiction that @xmath84 exists .",
    "sample @xmath512 in those connected components of the complement of @xmath450 to see that @xmath513 where the harmonic function is equal to @xmath456 .",
    "in particular , note that a connected component of @xmath3 where the corresponding harmonic function @xmath514 is @xmath496 remains a connected component of @xmath515 .",
    "such a connected component has boundary value @xmath496 , but has no boundary arc that is shared with a component of @xmath515 where the harmonic function is @xmath516 .",
    "this leads to a contradiction with an observation made above : we know from the construction of @xmath517 that all interior boundary arcs are shared by two components of the complement .",
    "we conclude this subsection with a small discussion about signs of the harmonic functions assigned to each @xmath518 of cle@xmath0 . as mentioned in section [ cle4 ] , by combining the radial sle@xmath296 construction and the reversibility of sle@xmath0 one",
    "can show that it is possible to first sample the family @xmath518 , and then the labels @xmath26 using independent fair coins .",
    "the idea is that one can define the symmetric radial sle@xmath297 using a poisson point process of sle@xmath0 bubbles , which is invariant under resampling of the orientations of the bubbles , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this conditional independence between the heights in different domains feature is specific to cle@xmath0 .",
    "for instance , for cle@xmath72 the existence of a correlation between the heights in different domains is clear from the construction . for @xmath429 ,",
    "the situation is actually quite reversed : conditioned on @xmath429 , one fair coin toss that decides the sign of the harmonic function at the origin is enough to determine the harmonic function in all the other connected components of the complement of @xmath429 .",
    "this follows from the fact that any two neighbouring components have different heights . in the case of @xmath473 for @xmath519",
    ", one does not even need to toss a coin , as the asymmetry ( and conformal invariance ) makes it in fact possible to detect almost surely the sign of the harmonic function at the origin . from this point of view , it is even quite intriguing that by iterating @xmath429 , one obtains a cle@xmath0 where the signs of the heights are independent in the different components .",
    "let us first focus on the case of the set @xmath525 .",
    "fix a point @xmath333 and note that the construction of the set @xmath1 is obtained via a continuously increasing family of sets @xmath526 that correspond to the concatenation of the various chordal sle@xmath527 and sle@xmath427 processes that one iterates .",
    "all these sets @xmath528 are clearly local sets , and the value of the corresponding harmonic function @xmath529 at @xmath35 is always in @xmath530 $ ] ( as its boundary values are in @xmath531 ) .",
    "furthermore , by definition it is a local martingale , and therefore a martingale .",
    "we know that it converges to either @xmath191 or @xmath532 as @xmath533 .",
    "on the other hand , we know ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) that when @xmath534 is a continuously increasing family of local sets then @xmath535 evolves like a constant times brownian motion when parametrized by the decrease of the log - conformal radius of @xmath536 seen from @xmath35 .",
    "this therefore implies that @xmath537 is distributed like a constant times the exit time of @xmath343 by a one - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "exactly the same argument can be applied to all @xmath450 s that we have constructed  one just needs to note that in our iterative procedure , all the iterations are independent and the harmonic functions @xmath188 always remain in @xmath538 $ ] .",
    "note that this argument can be used to see that @xmath435 is indeed a btls with upper minkowski dimension almost surely not larger than @xmath434 and that cle@xmath0 obtained by iterations of @xmath435 is indeed a btls ( as it satisfies @xmath539 ) .",
