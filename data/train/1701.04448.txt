    "in the preceding section , we demonstrated that a classical asymmetric top molecule in a static electric field is chaotic",
    ". we will now investigate whether and how the chaos affects laser - assisted alignment of these molecules .",
    "as an example , we consider rigid so@xmath0 molecules interacting with a linearly polarized laser pulse of 50  fs duration ( full width at half maximum of the intensity envelope ) and a peak intensity of 50  tw/@xmath148 at an initial rotational temperature of 10  k. the static electric field is chosen to be parallel to the laser electric field , with three different strengths : 0 , 150 , and 750  kv / cm .",
    "although some of these values might be experimentally challenging , they allow us to investigate different regimes and strengths of the chaotic dynamics .",
    "note also that the dynamics are scalable : a heavier molecule at a lower temperature shows the same dynamics at lower field strengths .    for molecules that are not subject to an additional static field , it is known that a short laser pulse aligns the most - polarizable axis of the molecule , in case of so@xmath0 the @xmath17-axis , towards the laser polarization axis  @xcite .",
    "in particular , impulsive laser alignment is known to impart a kick to the molecules , which leads to alignment of the molecules shortly after the laser pulse is over .",
    "subsequently , the alignment decreases again , showing quantum mechanical revivals on a longer time - scale .",
    "also , the time - averaged value of the alignment factor is increased .",
    "recall that in our setup , we choose the laser - polarization axis to be parallel to the static field , and thus the projection of the angular momentum on the electric field axis is conserved .",

    "it is important to note that this ratio refers to the expectation value of the energy ; the actual wave packet after the laser pulse is rather broad , covering both chaotic and regular regions for the cases of 150  kv / cm and 750  kv / cm .",

    "furthermore , the height of this peak is comparable for all three cases , being slightly lower for an increasing strength of the static field .",
    "this does not appear to be related to the chaotic dynamics , but due to the competition between the two fields : the interaction between the permanent dipole and the static field leads to an orientation of the @xmath18-axis and thus anti - alignment of the @xmath17-axis , lowering the effect of the aligning laser field .",
    "looking at the time - averaged alignment ( @xmath150 in table  [ tab.compare ] ) we find the same picture .",
    "for all three cases , the laser pulse increases the time - averaged alignment of the @xmath17-axis considerably .",
    "the values are slightly lower for stronger static fields .",
    "again , we suggest that the reason is to be found in the anti - aligning character of the static field .    a different picture is found when looking at the revivals of the alignment signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig.alignment ] ) : the results differ significantly for the three considered static field strengths . for the case of no field , we find several revivals .",
    "the most notable ones are around 13  ps , 27  ps , and 40  ps ; the two latter are rather broad .",
    "a comparison with earlier works  @xcite shows that these revivals can be identified as half and full revivals of the @xmath50-type and the @xmath151-type .",
    "the former has a period of approximately @xmath152 , the latter a period of @xmath153 .",
    "the @xmath50-type revival is associated with rotations around the @xmath8- and @xmath18-axes , the @xmath151-type with rotations around the @xmath18-axis  @xcite . for the cases of non - zero static fields ,",
    "we find that the revivals become weaker , and finally disappear , with an increasing field strength . in additional calculations for very strong fields of 50000  kv /",
    "cm ( not shown here ) , we found that revivals reappear , although at different times .",
    "for such strong fields , the dynamics are well below the potential barrier and almost completely regular .",
    "it is therefore likely that the rotational chaos is the reason for the disappearance of the revivals .    in sec .",
    "[ sec.chaos ] , we showed that chaos is strongest for rotations around the @xmath8-axis , where even a weak static field leads to chaotic motion .",
    "on the other hand , rotations around the @xmath18-axis remain regular for much stronger fields .",
    "thus , one naively might think the @xmath50-type revivals are more strongly affected by the chaos than the @xmath151-type revivals .",
    "however , comparing figs .",
    "[ fig.alignment ]  ( a ) and  ( b ) shows that both types are , roughly , equally affected .",

    "note that the interaction potential between the laser field and the induced dipole is of a very similar character to the interaction potential between the static field and the permanent dipole , and could thus also induce chaotic dynamics .",
    "however , for the laser pulses considered in this work , no exponential divergence was observed within the short duration of the laser pulses .    as for the wave packet revivals",

    "we have investigated laser - induced molecular alignment in a system with rotational chaos : so@xmath0 molecules in a static electric field , aligned by a femtosecond non - resonant laser pulse .",
    "the control scheme was found to be robust against rotational chaos .",
    "both the transient alignment peak shortly after the laser pulse as well as the time - averaged alignment were essentially unaffected by the additional static field , although investigations on the classical systems showed that a large fraction of the phase space displayed chaotic dynamics .",
    "the only affected part of the control scheme were the quantum mechanical revivals , which were lost when the chaos became too strong .    using numerical simulations we showed that the alignment dynamics were faster than the chaos - induced exponential divergence for all investigated scenarios .",
    "this indicates that alignment dynamics are inherently faster , and therefore robust against the chaos .",
    "if this is indeed the case , we would expect that excitation schemes that operate on longer time - scales are more affected by chaos .",

    "since the centrifuge pulse itself could induce chaotic dynamics , chaos may have played a role in that experiment .",
    "a study examining this possibility is therefore motivated .",
    "in many chaotic systems previously studied in molecular dynamics , the chaos is generated by the coupling of coordinates via the potential . by determining the regions of configuration space",

    "the dynamics is more complicated , with momenta being coupled as well .",
    "hence the chaotic divergence is likely generated in phase space rather than configuration space . for a future study",
