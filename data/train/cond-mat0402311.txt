    "noise is a basic ingredient of many types of model in physics , mathematics , economy , as well as in engineering . besides that in each area of research the fluctuations have very different origins , in many cases the evolution equation governing the system of interest",
    "can be approximated by a suitable stochastic differential equation .",
    "in general the driving forces may be any source of fluctuations and the system can be characterized by a given potential .",
    "the most popular of those stochastic differential equations are the one driven by white gaussian fluctuations , therefore the problem can immediately be reduced to the well known fokker - planck dynamics @xcite . if the fluctuations are not gaussian we are faced with a problem that is hard to solve , but among the different types of fluctuations the so call dichotomic noise is a good candidate to study , because in general for any potential some conclusions can be drawn @xcite .",
    "if the fluctuations are different from the gaussian ones or the dichotomic noise , in general it is not possible to solve the problem for any potential .    in many situations the technical complications of the model can be diminished by studying the system in a linear approximation , i.e. , around the fixed points of the dissipative dynamics .",
    "this approximation leads to the study of linear stochastic differential equations with arbitrary noises .",
    "besides the simplicity of this kind of equations they were the subject of numerous theoretical investigation , and also they provide non - trivial models for the study of many different mechanism of relaxation in physics , biology and another research areas .    from the previous considerations ,",
    "it is clear that the usefulness of a linear langevin equation arises from the possibility of working with different kind of noise structures .",
    "therefore , one is faced with the characterization , in general , of non - markov processes .",
    "these processes can only be completely characterized through the whole kolmogorov hierarchy of the stochastic process @xcite , i.e. : the knowledge of any @xmath0joint probability , or equivalently any @xmath0time moment and/or cumulant .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using a functional technique , we have been able to characterize arbitrary linear langevin equations with local dissipation , giving therefore a procedure to calculate the whole kolmogorov hierarchy of the process and any @xmath0time moment . using this previous experience , in this paper",
    "we are going to generalize our functional technique to tackle the more general situation where the dissipative term is non - local in time and the noise is also arbitrary ; this is what we call a _ generalized langevin equation _ ,",
    "i.e. , a linear langevin equation with arbitrary memory and driven by any noise structure @xmath1 where @xmath2 , the fluctuation term ( i.e. , the external noise ) is characterized by its associated functional , and @xmath3 is an arbitrary memory kernel .",
    "this type of generalized langevin equation arises quite natural ( considering gaussian fluctuations ) in the context of the zwanzig - mori projector operator technique @xcite ; in this case the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is required @xcite , which imposes that @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the dissipative memory must be consistent with the structure of the correlation of the gaussian fluctuations @xcite . nevertheless , if the system is far away from equilibrium , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is not fulfilled and in general the gaussian assumption is not a good candidate to describe the fluctuations of the system .",
    "therefore , in a general situation , both the kernel and the noise properties must be considered independent elements whose interplay will determine the full stochastic dynamics of the process @xmath5 . along the paper",
    "we will be interested in characterizing this noise - induced interplay by assuming different kind of noises and memory kernels , both in the transient as in the long - time regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , after a short review of the functional method , we obtain the characteristic functional for a vectorial langevin equation with memory . in section iii",
    "we apply this result to different situations .",
    "first we analyze the case of stable noises ; after this step , we analyze the stochastic dynamics induced by an exponential memory kernel in a process driven by two different fluctuating structures : radioactive and poisson noises . then the interplay between the kernel and the noise properties",
    "is emphasized . the necessary noise s properties that guarantee a stationary distribution with a long - tail are presented . as an example we introduce the abel noise that induces this asymptotic behavior .",
    "the characterization of a fractional langevin equation with arbitrary noise is also presented .",
    "the interplay between the fractional property of the differential operator and the lvy noise is analyzed . in section",

    "<S> as examples we have characterized through the 1-time probability a noise - induced interplay between the dissipative dynamics and the structure of different noises . </S>",
    "<S> conditions that lead to non - gaussian statistics and distributions with long tails are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of arbitrary fluctuations in fractional langevin equations have also been pointed out . </S>"
