    "observational data coming from the type ia supernovae ( sneia ) surveys , large scale structure ( lss ) , and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy spectrum indicate that the expansion of our present universe is accelerating rather than slowing down @xcite .",
    "this cosmic acceleration can not be explained by the four known fundamental interactions in the standard models , which is the greatest challenge today in the modern physics .",
    "the proposals that have been put forward to explain this observed phenomenon can basically be classified into two categories .",
    "one is to assume that in the framework of einstein s general relativity ( gr ) , an exotic component with negative pressure called dark energy ( de ) is necessary to explain this observed phenomena . for a good review on the dynamics of different de models",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "another alternative to account for the current accelerating cosmic expansion is to modify gr theory .",
    "the well - known modified gravity theories are , for examples , @xmath4 theory , scalar - tensor theory ( including brans - dicke theory ) , braneworld scenarios ( such as dgp , rsi and rsii ) , @xmath5 theory ( @xmath6 is the gauss - bonett term ) , hoava - lifshitz theory , modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , and so forth . for some relevant reviews",
    "see @xcite .",
    "recently , a new modified gravity theory namely the so - called @xmath0 theory @xcite-@xcite was proposed to describe the present accelerating expansion of the universe without resorting to de .",
    "it is a generalization of the teleparallel gravity ( tg ) @xcite by replacing the so - called torsion scalar @xmath3 with @xmath0 .",
    "tg was originally developed by einstein in an attempt of unifying gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "the basic variables in tg are tetrad fields @xmath7 , where the weitzenbock connection rather than the levi - civita connection was used to define the covariant derivative . as a result",
    ", the spacetime has no curvature but contains torsion .",
    "a vector @xmath8 in tg is parallel transported along a curve if its projection @xmath9 remains constant , this is the so - called teleparallelism .",
    "the main advantage of @xmath0 theory is that its field equations are the second order which are remarkably simpler than the fourth order equations of @xmath4 theory @xcite .",
    "the other interesting issue in modern cosmology is the thermodynamical description of the accelerating universe driven by de or modified gravity .",
    "it was shown that by applying the first law of thermodynamics ( clausius relation ) @xmath10 to the apparent horizon @xmath11 , the friedmann equation in the einstein gravity can be derived if we take the hawking temperature @xmath12 and the entropy @xmath13 on the apparent horizon , where @xmath14 is the area of the horizon @xcite . here , @xmath15 is the amount of energy flow through the fixed apparent horizon .",
    "the equivalence between the first law of thermodynamics and the friedmann equation was also found for gravity with gauss - bonnet term , the lovelock gravity theory and the braneworld scenarios @xcite .    note that in the thermodynamics of the apparent horizon in the einstein gravity , the geometric entropy is assumed to be proportional to its horizon area , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , this definition is changed for other modified gravity theories . for instance , the geometric entropy in @xmath4 gravity is given by @xmath16 @xcite , where the subscript @xmath17 denotes a derivative with respect to the curvature scalar r. in @xmath0 gravity , it was shown that when @xmath18 is small , the first law of black hole thermodynamics is satisfied approximatively and the entropy of horizon is @xmath19 @xcite , where the subscript @xmath3 denotes a derivative with respect to the torsion scalar @xmath3 .    besides examining the validity of the thermodynamical interpretation of gravity by expressing the gravitational field equations into the first law of thermodynamics in different spacetimes , it is also of great interest to investigate the validity of the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics in the accelerating universe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the gsl of thermodynamics like the first law is an accepted principle in physics .    here",
    ", our aim is to investigate the gsl of thermodynamics in the framework of @xmath0 gravity for a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe filled with the pressureless matter . to do this , in section 2 , we briefly review the @xmath0 gravity . in section 3 ,",
    "we investigate the gsl of thermodynamics on the dynamical apparent horizon with the hawking temperature . in section 4 , for two viable @xmath0 models we first calculate the effective equation of state and deceleration parameters . then , the null and strong energy conditions are investigated .",
    "also the viability of both models is checked by cosmography .",
    "finally , the validity of the gsl is examined .",
