    "the flavor content of the nucleon sea provides an important test for models of nucleon structure .",
    "a flavor symmetric sea leads to the gottfried sum rule @xmath6 @xcite , whereas any deviation from this value is an indication of the @xmath7 asymmetry of the nucleon sea .",
    "the first clear evidence of a violation of the gottfried sum rule came from the new muon collaboration ( nmc ) @xcite , which was later confirmed by drell - yan experiments @xcite and a measurement of semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "all experiments show evidence that there are more @xmath4 quarks in the proton than there are @xmath5 quarks .",
    "the experimental results and theoretical ideas on the flavor asymmetric sea are summarized in several review articles @xcite .    in the constituent quark model ( cqm ) , the proton is described in terms of a @xmath8 valence - quark configuration . therefore , a violation of the gottfried sum rule implies the existence of higher fock components ( such as @xmath9 configurations ) in the proton wave function .",
    "additional indications for the importance of multiquark components are provided by parity - violating electron scattering experiments , which have shown evidence for a nonvanishing strange quark contribution , albeit small , to the charge and magnetization distributions of the proton @xcite , and by cqm studies of baryon spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "whereas most models ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) reproduce the mass spectrum of baryon resonances reasonably well , they show very similar deviations for other properties , such as for example the electromagnetic and strong decay widths of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the spin - orbit splitting of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the low @xmath14 behavior of transition form factors , and the large @xmath15 decay widths of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "all of these results point towards the need to include exotic degrees of freedom ( _ i.e. _ other than @xmath19 ) , such as multiquark @xmath20 or gluonic @xmath21 configurations . as an illustration",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ d13 ] the transverse electromagnetic transition form factors of the @xmath22 resonance for different cqms .",
    "the problem of missing strength at low @xmath14 can be attributed to the lack of explicit quark - antiquark degrees of freedom , which become more important in the outer region of the nucleon .",
    "theoretically , the role of @xmath23 configurations in the nucleon wave function was studied in an application to the electromagnetic form factors @xcite .",
    "mesonic contributions to the spin and flavor structure of the nucleon are reviewed in @xcite .    in another , cqm based , approach the importance of @xmath2 pairs in the proton was studied in a flux - tube breaking model based on valence - quark plus glue dominance to which @xmath2 pairs are added in perturbation @xcite .",
    "the pair - creation mechanism is inserted at the quark level and the one - loop diagrams are calculated by summing over a complete set of intermediate baryon - meson states @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . for consistency with the ozi - rule and to retain the success of the cqm in hadron spectroscopy",
    ", it was found necessary to sum over a complete set of intermediate states , including both pseudoscalar and vector mesons , rather than just a few low - lying states @xcite .    in order to address the violation of the gottfried sum rule",
    ", we first generalize the model of @xcite to include @xmath0 and @xmath1 loops as well .",
    "the formalism of the ensuing unquenched quark model is reviewed briefly before discussing an application to the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea .",
    "in the flux - tube model for hadrons , the quark potential model arises from an adiabatic approximation to the gluonic degrees of freedom embodied in the flux tube @xcite .",
    "the role of quark - antiquark pairs in meson spectroscopy was studied in a flux - tube breaking model @xcite in which the @xmath3 pair is created with the @xmath25 quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "subsequently , it was shown by geiger and isgur @xcite that a _ miraculous _ set of cancellations between apparently uncorrelated sets of intermediate states occurs in such a way that they compensate each other and do not destroy the good cqm results for the mesons .",
    "in particular , the ozi hierarchy is preserved and there is a near immunity of the long - range confining potential , since the change in the linear potential due to the creation of quark - antiquark pairs in the string can be reabsorbed into a new strength of the linear potential , _",
    "i.e. _ in a new string tension . as a result ,",
    "the net effect of the mass shifts from pair creation is smaller than the naive expectation of the order of the strong decay widths .",
    "however , it is necessary to sum over large towers of intermediate states to see that the spectrum of the mesons , after unquenching and renormalizing , is only weakly perturbed .",
    "an important conclusion is that no simple truncation of the set of meson loops is able to reproduce such results @xcite .",
    "the extension of the flux - tube breaking model to baryons requires a proper treatment of the permutation symmetry between identical quarks . as a first step ,",
    "geiger and isgur investigated the importance of @xmath2 loops in the proton by taking into account the contribution of the six different diagrams of fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and by using harmonic oscillator wave functions for the baryons and mesons @xcite . in the conclusions ,",
    "the authors emphasized that , in order to investigate the origin of the violation of the gottfried sum rule and the spin crisis of the proton , it is necessary to extend their calculation to include @xmath0 and @xmath1 loops as well . in this contribution , we take up this challenge and present a generalization of the formalism of @xcite in which quark - antiquark contributions can be studied    * for any initial baryon resonance , * for any flavor of the quark - antiquark pair , and * for any model of baryons and mesons .",
    "these extensions were made possible by two developments : the solution of the problem of the permutation symmetry between identical quarks by means of group - theoretical techniques , and the construction of an algorithm to generate a complete set of intermediate states for any model of baryons and mesons . while the first improvement allows the evaluation of the contribution of quark - antiquark pairs for any initial baryon @xmath28 ( ground state or resonance ) and for any flavor of the @xmath3 pair ( not only @xmath29 , but also @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , the second one permits the carry out the sum over intermediate states up to saturation for any model of baryons and mesons , as long as their wave functions are expressed in the basis of harmonic oscillator wave functions .",
    "the ensuing unquenched quark model is based on an adiabatic treatment of the flux - tube dynamics to which @xmath3 pairs with vacuum quantum numbers are added as a perturbation @xcite",
    ". the pair - creation mechanism is inserted at the quark level and the one - loop diagrams are calculated by summing over a complete set of intermediate states . under these assumptions , to leading order in pair creation , the baryon wave function is given by @xmath32 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 denotes the initial baryon and @xmath34 and @xmath35 the intermediate baryon and meson , @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the relative radial momentum and orbital angular momentum of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and @xmath38 is the total angular momentum @xmath39 . the operator @xmath40 represents the quark - antiquark pair - creation operator with the @xmath25 quantum numbers of the vacuum @xcite @xmath41^{(0 ) }   b_i^{\\dagger}(\\vec{p}_i ) \\ , d_j^{\\dagger}(\\vec{p}_j ) ~.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the creation operators for a quark and antiquark with momenta @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the quark pair is characterized by a color singlet wave function @xmath46 , a flavor singlet wave function @xmath47 and a spin triplet wave function @xmath48 with spin @xmath49 .",
    "the solid harmonic @xmath50 indicates that the quark and antiquark are in a relative @xmath51 wave .",
    "since the operator @xmath40 creates a pair of constituent quarks , a gaussian quark - antiquark creation vertex function was introduced by which the pair is created as a finite object with an effective size , rather than as a pointlike object . in momentum space it is given by @xmath52 the width has been determined from meson decays to be approximately @xmath53 fm @xcite .",
    "here we take the average value , @xmath54 fm .",
    "finally , the dimensionless constant @xmath55 is the intrinsic pair creation strength which has been determined from strong decays of baryons as @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling vertex @xmath57 was derived in explicit form in the harmonic oscillator basis @xcite . in the present calculations , we use harmonic oscillator wave functions",
    "in which there is a single oscillator parameter for the baryons and another one for the mesons which , following @xcite , are taken to be @xmath58 gev @xcite and @xmath59 ( gev ) @xcite , respectively .    in general , matrix elements of an observable @xmath60 can be expressed as @xmath61 where the first term denotes the contribution from the valence quarks @xmath62 and the second term that from the @xmath3 pairs @xmath63 we developed an algorithm based upon group - theoretical techniques to generate a complete set of intermediate states of good permutational symmetry , which makes it possible to perform the sum over intermediate states up to saturation , and not just for the first few shells as in @xcite .",
    "not only does this have a significant impact on the numerical result , but it is necessary for consistency with the ozi - rule and the success of cqms in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "the first clear evidence for the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea was provided by nmc at cern @xcite .",
    "the flavor asymmetry is related to the gottfried integral for the difference of the proton and neutron electromagnetic structure functions @xmath64",
    "\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{3 } \\left [ 1 - 2(n_{\\bar{d}}-n_{\\bar{u } } ) \\right ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the assumption of a flavor symmetric sea @xmath65 one obtains the gottfried sum rule @xmath6 .",
    "the final nmc value is @xmath66 at @xmath67 ( gev / c)@xmath68 for the gottfried integral over the range @xmath69 @xcite , which implies a flavor asymmetric sea .",
    "the violation of the gottfried sum rule has been confirmed by other experimental collaborations @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] shows that the experimental values of the gottfried integral are consistent with each other within the quoted uncertainties , even though the experiments were performed at very different scales , as reflected in the average @xmath14 values .",
    "theoretically , it was shown that in the framework of the cloudy bag model the coupling of the proton to the pion cloud provides a mechanism to produce a flavor asymmetry due to the dominance of @xmath70 among the virtual configurations @xcite .    in the unquenched quark model",
    ", the flavor asymmetry can be calculated from the difference of the number of @xmath4 and @xmath5 sea quarks in the proton @xmath71 even in absence of explicit information on the ( anti)quark distribution functions , the integrated value can be obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ asym ] ) .",
    "the effect of the quark - antiquark pairs on the gottfried integral is a reduction of about one third with respect to the gottfried sum rule , corresponding to an excess of @xmath4 over @xmath5 quarks in the proton which is in qualitative agreement with the nmc result .",
    "an explicit calculation with harmonic oscillator wave functions for the baryons and mesons in which the sum over intermediate states includes four oscillator shells , shows a proton asymmetry @xmath72 which corresponds to @xmath73 , in remarkable agreement with the experimental value .",
    "it is important to note that in this calculation the parameters were taken from the literature @xcite , and that no attempt was made to optimize their values . due to isospin symmetry",
    ", the neutron has a similar excess of @xmath5 over @xmath4 quarks @xmath74 .",
