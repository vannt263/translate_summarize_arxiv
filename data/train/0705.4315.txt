    "motivated by einstein s ideas for searching for new fundamental symmetries in nature , our main focus is to go back to that point of the old incompatibility between mechanics and electrodynamics , by extending his reasoning in order to look for new symmetries that implement gravitation into electrodynamics of moving particles .",
    "we introduce more symmetries into the space - time geometry , where gravitation and electromagnetism become coupled with each other , in such a way to enable us to build a new dynamics that is compatible with the quantum indeterminations .",
    "besides quantum gravity at the planck length scale , our new symmetry idea appears due to the indispensable presence of gravity at quantum level for particles with very large wavelengths ( very low energies ) .",
    "this leads us to postulate a universal minimum speed related to a fundamental ( privileged ) reference frame of background field that breaks lorentz symmetry@xcite .",
    "similarly to einstein s reasoning , which has solved that old incompatibility between nature of light and motion of matter ( massive objects ) , let us now expand it by making the following heuristic assumption based on new symmetry arguments :    _ if , in order to preserve the symmetry ( covariance ) of maxwell s equations , @xmath0 is required to be constant based on einstein s reasoning , according to which it is impossible to find the rest reference frame for the speed of light ( @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) ) due to the coexistence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in equal - footing , then now let us think that fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 may also coexist for moving charged massive particles ( as electrons),which are at subluminal level ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "so , by making such an assumption , it would be also impossible to find a rest reference frame for a charged massive particle , by canceling its magnetic field , i.e.,@xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "this would break the coexistence of these two fields , which would not be possible because it is impossible to find a reference frame where @xmath8,in such a space - time .",
    "thus we always must have @xmath7 and also @xmath9 for charged massive particles , due always to the presence of a non - null momentum for the electron , in a similar way to the photon electromagnetic wave .",
    "_    the reasoning above leads to the following conclusion :    -_the plane wave for free electron is an idealization impossible to conceive under physical reality . in the event of an idealized plane wave",
    ", it would be possible to find the reference frame that cancels its momentum ( @xmath10),just the same way as we can find the reference frame of rest for classical ( macroscopic ) objects with uniform rectilineal motion ( a state of equilibrium ) .",
    "in such an idealized case , we could find a reference frame where @xmath6 for charged particle .",
    "however , the presence of gravity in quantum world emerges in order to always preserve the coexistence of @xmath3 and @xmath11 in electrodynamics of moving massive particles ( section 3 ) . that is the reason why we think about a lowest and unattainable speed limit @xmath12 in such a space - time , in order to avoid to think about @xmath6 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this means that there is no state of perfect equilibrium ( plane wave and galilean inertial reference frame ) for moving particles in such a space - time , except the privileged inertial reference frame of a universal background field associated with an unattainable minimum limit of speed @xmath12 .",
    "such a reasoning allows us to think that the electromagnetic radiation ( photon:@xmath13 ) as well as the matter ( electron : @xmath14 ) are in equal - footing , since now it is not possible to find a reference frame in equilibrium ( @xmath15 ) for both through any velocity transformations _",
    "( section 6 ) .",
    "the interval of velocity with two limits @xmath16 represents the fundamental symmetry that is inherent to such a space - time , where gravitation and electrodynamics become coupled . however , for classical ( macroscopic ) objects , the breaking of that symmetry , i.e.,@xmath17 , occurs so as to reinstate special relativity ( sr ) as a particular ( classical ) case , namely no uncertainties and no vacuum energy , where the idea of rest , based on the galilean concept of reference frame is thus recovered .    in another paper , we will study the dynamics of particles in the presence of such a universal ( privileged ) background reference frame associated with @xmath12 , within a context of the ideas of mach@xcite , schroedinger@xcite and sciama@xcite , where we will think about an absolute background reference frame in relation to which we have the inertia of all moving particles .",
    "however , we must emphasize that the approach we will intend to use is not classical as the machian ideas ( the inertial reference frame of fixed stars),since the lowest limit of speed @xmath12,related to the privileged reference frame connected to a vacuum energy , has origin essentially from the presence of gravity at quantum level for particles with very large wavelengths .",
    "we hope that a direct relationship should exist between the minimum speed @xmath12 and planck s minimum length @xmath18 treated by double special relativity theory ( dsr)[20 - 25 ] ( 4th section ) .    in the next section",
    ", a heuristic model will be developed to describe the electromagnetic nature of the matter .",
    "it is based on the maxwell theory used for investigating the electromagnetic nature of a photon when the amplitudes of electromagnetic wave fields are normalized for one single photon with energy @xmath19 .",
    "thus , due to the reciprocity and symmetry reasoning , we shall extend such a concept for the matter ( electron ) through the idea of pair materialization after @xmath20-photon decay , so that we will attempt to develop a simple heuristic model of the electromagnetic nature of the electron that will experiment a background field in the presence of gravity .",
    "the structure of space - time becomes extended due to the presence of a vacuum energy density associated with such a universal background field ( a privileged reference frame connected to a zero - point energy of background field , which is associated with the minimum limit of speed @xmath12 for particles moving with respect to such a background reference frame ) .",
    "this leads to a negative pressure at the cosmological length scales , behaving like a cosmological anti - gravity for the cosmological constant whose tiny value will be determined ( section 8) .",
    "in accordance with some laws of quantum electrodynamics@xcite , we shall take into account the electric field of a plane electromagnetic wave whose amplitude is normalized for just one single photon@xcite . to do this ,",
    "consider that the vector potential of a plane electromagnetic wave is    @xmath21    where @xmath22,admitting that the wave propagates in the direction of z , being @xmath23 the unitary vector of polarization .",
    "since we are in vacuum , we must consider    @xmath24    in the gaussian system of units , we have @xmath25 . so the average energy density of the wave shall be    @xmath26    substituting ( 2 ) into ( 3),we obtain    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is an amplitude that depends upon the number of photons in such a wave .",
    "since we wish to obtain the plane wave of one single photon ( @xmath19),then by making this condition for ( 4 ) and by considering an unitary volume for the photon ( @xmath29),we have    @xmath30    substituting ( 5 ) into ( 2),we obtain    @xmath31    from where , we deduce that    @xmath32    where @xmath33 could be thought of as an electric field amplitude normalized for 1 single photon , with @xmath34 ( gaussian system),being the magnetic field amplitude normalized for 1 photon .",
    "so we may write    @xmath35    substituting ( 8) into ( 3 ) and considering the unitary volume ( @xmath29),we obtain    @xmath36    now , starting from the classical theory of maxwell for the electromagnetic wave , let us consider an average quadratic electric field normalized for one single photon , which is @xmath37 . so doing such a consideration , we may write ( 9 ) in the following alternative way :    @xmath38    where we have    @xmath39    it is important to emphasize that , although the field in ( 8) is normalized for only one photon , it is still a classical field of maxwell because its value oscillates like a classical wave ( solution ( 8) ) .",
    "the only difference is that we have thought about a small amplitude field for one photon .",
    "actually the amplitude of the field ( @xmath33 ) can not be measured directly . only in the classical approximation ( macroscopic case ) , when we have a very large number of photons ( @xmath40),we can somehow measure the macroscopic field @xmath41 of the wave . therefore , although we could idealize the case of just one photon as if it were an electromagnetic wave of small amplitude , the solution ( 8) is even a classical one , since the field @xmath3 presents oscillation .",
    "actually we already know that the photon wave is a quantum wave , i.e.,a de - broglie wave , where its wavelength ( @xmath42 ) is not interpreted classically as the oscillation frequency ( wavelength due to oscillation ) of a classical field . however , in a classical case , using the solution ( 8),we would have    @xmath43    in accordance with ( 12),if the wave of a photon were really classical , then its energy would not be fixed , as we can see in ( 12 ) .",
    "consequently , its energy @xmath19 would just be an average value [ see ( 10 ) ] .",
    "hence , in order to achieve consistency between the result ( 10 ) and the quantum wave ( de - broglie wave),we must interpret ( 10 ) to be related to the de - broglie wave of the photon with a fixed discrete energy value @xmath19 instead of an average energy value , since now we consider that the wave of one single photon is a non - classical wave , i.e.,it is a de - broglie wave . thus we rewrite ( 10 ) as follows :    @xmath44    where we conclude that    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the de - broglie wavelength .",
    "now , in this case ( 14),the single photon field @xmath47 should not be assumed as a mean value for oscillating classical field , and we shall preserve it in order to interpret it as a _ scalar quantum electric field _ ( a microscopic field ) of a photon .",
    "so basing on such a heuristic reasoning , let us also call it _  scalar support of electric field\"_,representing a quantum ( corpuscular)-mechanical aspect of electric field for the photon .",
    "as @xmath47 is responsible for the energy of the photon ( @xmath48),where @xmath49 and @xmath50,indeed we see that @xmath47 presents a quantum behavior , as it provides the dual aspects ( wave - particle ) of the photon , where its mechanical momentum may be written as @xmath51=@xmath52 [ refer to ( 14)],or simply @xmath53 .",
    "our objective is to extend the idea of the photon electromagnetic energy [ equation ( 13 ) ] for the matter . by doing this",
    ", we shall provide heuristic arguments that rely directly on de - broglie reciprocity postulate , which has extended the idea of wave ( photon wave ) for the matter ( electron ) , behaving also like wave .",
    "thus the relation ( 14 ) for the photon , which is based on de - broglie relation ( @xmath42 ) may also be extended for the matter ( electron),in accordance with the idea of de - broglie reciprocity . in order to strengthen such an argument",
    ", we are going to assume the phenomenon of pair formation , where the photon @xmath20 decays into two charged massive particles , namely the electron ( @xmath54 ) and its anti - particle , the positron ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "such an example will enable us to better understand the need of extending the idea of the photon electromagnetic mass ( @xmath56 ) ( equation 13 ) for the matter ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , by using that concept of _ field scalar support._.    now consider the phenomenon of pair formation , i.e .",
    ", @xmath57 .",
    "then , by using the conservation of energy for @xmath20-decay , we write the following equation : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent the kinetic energy for electron and positron respectively .",
    "we have @xmath61mev for electron or positron .    since the photon @xmath20 electromagnetic energy is @xmath62,or else,@xmath63 given in the international system of units ( is),and also knowing that @xmath64 ( is),where @xmath65 represents the _ magnetic field",
    "scalar support _ for the photon @xmath20,so we also may write    @xmath66    photon has no charge , however , when it is materialized into the pair electron - positron , its electromagnetic content given in ( 16 ) ceases to be free or purely kinetic ( purely relativistic mass ) to become massive through the materialization of the pair .",
    "since such massive particles ( @xmath67 ) also behave like waves in accordance with de - broglie idea , now it would also be natural to extend the relation ( 14 ) ( of the photon ) for representing wavelengths of the matter ( electron or positron ) after the photon-@xmath20 decay , namely :    @xmath68 ^ 2}= \\frac{h}{\\epsilon_0[e_s^{(+,-)}][b_s^{(+,-)}]},\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 and @xmath70 play the role of the electromagnetic content for energy condensed into matter ( _ scalar support of electromagnetic field _ for the matter ) .",
    "such fields are associated with the total energy of the moving massive particle , whose mass has essentially an electromagnetic origin , given in the form    @xmath71    where @xmath72 .",
    "basing on ( 16 ) and ( 17),we may write ( 15 ) in the following way :    @xmath73 + [ c\\epsilon_0e_{s0}^{+}b_{s0}^{+}v_e + k^{+}]=\\ ] ]    @xmath74 , + where @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 represent the proper electromagnetic contents of electron or positron .",
    "later we will show that the mass @xmath78 does not represent a classic rest mass due to the inexistence of rest in such a space - time .",
    "this question shall be clarified in 5th section . the volume @xmath79 in ( 19 )",
    "is a free variable to be considered .    in accordance with equation ( 19),the present model provides a fundamental point that indicates electron is not necessarily an exact punctual particle .",
    "quantum electrodynamics , based on special relativity deals with the electron as a punctual particle .",
    "the well - known classical theory of the electron foresees for the electron radius the same order of magnitude of the radius of a proton , i.e.,@xmath80 .",
    "the most recent experimental evidence about scattering of electrons by electrons at very high kinetic energies indicates that the electron can be considered approximately a point particle .",
    "actually electrons have an extent less than collision distance , which is about @xmath81@xcite .",
    "actually such an extent is negligible in comparison to the dimensions of an atom ( @xmath82),or even the dimensions of a nucleus ( @xmath83),but it is not exactly a point . by this reason , the present model can provide a very small non - null volume @xmath79 for the electron .",
    "but , if we just consider @xmath84 according to ( 19),we would have an absurd result , i.e , divergent internal fields @xmath85 .",
    "however , for instance , if we consider @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) for our model , and knowing that @xmath88,thus , in such a case ( see ( 19)),we would obtain @xmath89 . such a value is extremely high and therefore we may conclude that the electron is extraordinarily compact , with a very high energy density .",
    "so , for such an example , if we imagine over the `` surface '' of the electron , we would detect a field @xmath89 instead of an infinite value for it . according to the present model , the field @xmath90 inside the almost punctual non - classical electron with such a radius ( @xmath91 )",
    "would be finite and constant ( @xmath92 ) instead of a function like @xmath93 with divergent classical behavior .",
    "indeed , for @xmath94,the field @xmath41 decreases like @xmath93,i.e,@xmath95 . for @xmath96 , @xmath97",
    "actually , for @xmath98,we have @xmath99 .",
    "the next section will be dedicated to the investigation about the electron coupled to a gravitational field .",
    "when a photon with energy @xmath100 is subjected to a certain gravitational potential @xmath101,its energy ( or frequency ) increases to be @xmath102,where    @xmath103    by convention , as we have stipulated @xmath104 to be attractive potential , we have @xmath105 . by considering ( 16 ) for any photon and by substituting ( 16 ) into ( 20),we alternatively",
    "write    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the first component of the metric tensor , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 .    from ( 21),we can extract the following relationships , namely :    @xmath110    in the presence of gravity , such fields @xmath47 and @xmath111 of the photon increase according to ( 22),leading to the increasing of the photon frequency or energy , according to ( 20 ) .",
    "thus we may think about the following increments , namely :    @xmath112    in accordance with general relativity ( gr),when a massive particle of mass @xmath78 moves in the presence of a gravitational potential @xmath101,its total energy @xmath41 is given in the following way :    @xmath113    where we can think that @xmath114 is the mass of the electron or positron , emerging from @xmath20-decay in the presence of a gravitational potential @xmath101 .    in order to facilitate the understanding of what we are proposing ,",
    "let us consider @xmath115,since we are interested only in obtaining the influence of the potential @xmath101 .",
    "therefore we write    @xmath116    as we already know that @xmath117,we can also write the total energy @xmath41,as follows :    @xmath118    from where we can extract    @xmath119    so we obtain    @xmath120    where we have @xmath121 .    as the energy of the particle can be represented as a condensation of electromagnetic fields in scalar forms @xmath122 and @xmath123,this model is capable of assisting us to think that the well - known external fields @xmath124 and @xmath125 for the moving charged particle , by storing an energy density ( @xmath126 ) should also suffer some influence ( shifts ) in the presence of gravitational potential . in accordance with gr ,",
    "every kind of energy is also a source of gravitational field .",
    "this non - linearity that is inherent to the gravitational field leads us to think that , at least in a certain approximation in the presence of gravity , the external fields @xmath41 and @xmath127 should experiment positive small shifts @xmath128 and @xmath129,which are proportional to the intrinsic increments ( shifts ) @xmath130 and @xmath131 of the particle , namely :    @xmath132    here we have omitted the signs @xmath133 in order to simplify the notation . since @xmath134,then @xmath135 .    in accordance with ( 29),we may conclude that there is a constant of proportionality that couples the external electromagnetic fields @xmath41 and @xmath127 of the moving charge with gravity by means of the small shifts @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "such a constant works like a fine - tuning , namely :    @xmath136    where @xmath137 is a dimensionaless constant to be obtained .",
    "we expect that @xmath138 due to the fact that the gravitational interaction is much weaker than the electromagnetic one .",
    "@xmath128 and @xmath129 depend only on @xmath101 over the electron .    substituting ( 28 ) into ( 30),we",
    "obtain    @xmath139    due to the very small positive shifts @xmath128 and @xmath129 in the presence of a weak gravitational potential @xmath101,the total electromagnetic energy density in the space around the charged particle is slightly increased , as follows :    @xmath140    substituting ( 31 ) into ( 32 ) and performing the calculations , we will finally obtain    @xmath141 + \\xi[\\epsilon_0 ee_{s0}+\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}bb_{s0}](\\sqrt{\\sqrt{g_{00 } } } -   1)+\\frac{1}{2}\\xi^2[\\epsilon_0 ( e_{s0})^2+\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(b_{s0})^2](\\sqrt{\\sqrt{g_{00}}}-1)^2\\ ] ]    we may assume that @xmath142 for representing ( 33 ) , where the first term @xmath143 is the free electromagnetic energy density ( zero order ) for the ideal case of a charged particle uncoupled from gravity ( @xmath144),i.e , the ideal case of a free particle ( a perfect plane wave , which does not exist in reality due always to the presence of gravity ) .",
    "we have @xmath145 ( _ coulombian term _ ) .",
    "the coupling term @xmath146 ( second term ) represents an electromagnetic energy density of first order , that is , it contains an influence of 1st order for @xmath128 and @xmath129,as it is proportional to @xmath128 and @xmath129 due to a certain influence of gravity .",
    "therefore it is a mixture term that behaves essentially like a _ radiation term_. thus we have @xmath147,since @xmath90 ( or @xmath148 ) @xmath149 and @xmath41(or @xmath127)@xmath150 .",
    "it is very interesting to notice that such a radiation term of a charge in a true gravitational field corresponds effectively to a certain radiation field due to an slightly accelerated charge in free space , however such an equivalence is weak due to the very small value of @xmath137 .",
    "the last coupling term ( @xmath151 ) is purely interactive due to the presence of gravity only .",
    "this means that it is a 2nd order interactive electromagnetic energy density term , since it is proportional to @xmath152 and to @xmath153 .",
    "hence we have @xmath154,being @xmath155,which varies only with the gravitational potential ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "since we have @xmath156,it has a non - locality behavior .",
    "this means that @xmath151 behaves like a kind of non - local field , that is inherent to the space ( _ a constant term for representing a background field _ ) .",
    "it does not depend on the distance @xmath157 from the charged particle .",
    "so it is a constant energy density for a fixed potential @xmath101,and fills the whole space .",
    "@xmath151 always exists due to the inevitable presence of gravity and therefore it can not be cancelled . due to this fact , the increment @xmath129 that contributes for the density of interactive energy @xmath151 can not vanish since the electron is not free ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "this always assures a non - zero value of magnetic field ( @xmath159 ) for any transformation , and so this is the fundamental reason why the fields @xmath41 and @xmath127 should coexist in the presence of gravity , where the charge experiments a background field ( @xmath160 ) connected to a privileged reference frame of an unattainable minimum speed that justifies in a kinematic point of view the impossibility of finding @xmath161 .",
    "this minimum speed ( @xmath12 ) is a universal constant that should be related directly to gravity ( @xmath162 ) , since @xmath12 is also responsible for the coexistence of @xmath41 and @xmath127 .",
    "we will see such a connection in the next section .",
    "usually we have @xmath163 .",
    "for a very weak gravitational field , we can consider a good practical approximation as @xmath164 .",
    "however , from a fundamental point of view , we can not neglect the coupling terms , specially the last one for large distances , as it has a vital importance in this work , permiting us to understand a non - local vacuum energy that is inherent to the space , i.e .",
    "@xmath156 . such a background field with energy density",
    "@xmath151 has deep implications for our understanding of the space - time structure at very large scales of length ( cosmological scales),since @xmath151 does not have @xmath157-dependence , i.e , it remains for @xmath165 .    in the next section , we will estimate the constant @xmath137 and consequently the idea of a universal minimum velocity in the space - time .",
    "its cosmological implications will be treated in section 8 .",
    "let us begin this section by considering the well - known problem that deals with the electron at the bound state of a coulombian potential of a proton ( hydrogen atom ) .",
    "we start from this subject because it poses a certain similarity with the present model for the electron coupled to a gravitational field .",
    "we know that the fine structure constant ( @xmath166 ) plays an important role for obtaining the energy levels that bond the electron to the nucleus ( proton ) in the hydrogen atom .",
    "therefore , in a similar way to such an idea , we plan to extend it in order to see that the fine coupling constant @xmath137 plays an even more fundamental role than the fine structure @xmath167,by considering that @xmath137 couples gravity to the electromagnetic field of the electron charge .",
    "let s initially consider the energy that bonds the electron to the proton at the fundamental state of the hydrogen atom , as follows :    @xmath168    where @xmath169 is assumed as module .",
    "we have @xmath170 , where @xmath78 is the electron mass , which is practically the reduced mass of the system ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "we have @xmath172 ( fine structure constant ) .",
    "since @xmath173 mev , we have @xmath174ev .    since we already know that @xmath175,so we may write ( 34 ) in the following alternative way :    @xmath176    from where we extract    @xmath177    it is interesting to observe that ( 36 ) maintains a certain similarity with ( 30),however , first of all",
    ", we must emphasize that the variations @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the electron energy have a purely coulombian origin , since the fine structure constant @xmath167 depends solely on the electron charge .",
    "thus we can write the electric force between two electronic charges in the following way :    @xmath178    where @xmath179 .",
    "if we just consider a gravitational interaction between two electrons , we would have    @xmath180    from where we obtain    @xmath181    we have @xmath182 due to the fact that the gravitational interaction is much weaker than the electric one , so that @xmath183,where @xmath184 .",
    "therefore we shall call @xmath185 with hyperfine structure ( spin interaction ) , as they are completely different . ]",
    "the _ superfine structure constant _ , since gravitational interaction creates a bonding energy extremely smaller than the coulombian bonding energy considered for the fundamental state ( @xmath169 ) in the hydrogen atom .    to sum up , whereas @xmath186 provides the adjustment for the coulombian bonding energies between two electronic charges , @xmath187 gives the adjustment for the gravitational bonding energies between two electronic masses .",
    "such bonding energies of electrical or gravitational origin increment the particle energy through @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "now , following the above reasoning , we notice that the present model enables us to introduce the very fine - tuning ( coupling ) @xmath137 between gravity ( a gravitational potential generated by the mass @xmath188 ) and electrical field ( electrical energy density generated by the charge @xmath189 ( refer to ( 30 ) ) ) .",
    "thus for such more fundamental case , we have a kind of bond of the type @xmath190 ( mass - charge ) through the adjustment ( coupling ) @xmath137 .",
    "so the subtleness here is that the bonding energy density due to @xmath137,by means of the increments @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( see ( 30 ) , ( 31),(32 ) or ( 33 ) ) occurs on the electric and magnetic fields generated in the space by the own charge @xmath189 .    although we could show a laborious and step by step problem for obtaining the constant @xmath137,the way we follow here is shorter because it starts from important analogies by using the ideas of fine structure @xmath191,i.e.,an eletric interaction ( _ charge - charge _ ) and also superfine structure @xmath192,i.e.,a gravitational interaction ( _ mass - mass _ ) .",
    "hence , now it is easy to conclude that the kind of mixing coupling we are proposing , of the type `` @xmath190 '' ( _ mass - charge _ ) represents a gravi - electrical coupling constant , which leads us naturally to think that such a constant @xmath137 is of the form @xmath193,and therefore meaning that    @xmath194    which represents a geometrical average between electrical and gravitational couplings , and so we finally obtain from ( 40 )    @xmath195    where indeed we have @xmath196 . from ( 41 )",
    "we obtain @xmath197 .",
    "let us call @xmath137 _ fine adjustment constant . _ the quantity @xmath198 in ( 41 )",
    "can be thought of as a _ gravitational charge _ @xmath199,so that @xmath200 .    in the hydrogen atom",
    ", we have the fine structure constant @xmath201 , where @xmath202 .",
    "this is the velocity of the electron at the atom fundamental level ( bohr velocity ) . at this level",
    ", the electron does not radiate because it is in a kind of balance state , in spite of its electrostatic interaction with the nucleus ( centripete force),namely it works effectively like an inertial system .",
    "hence , following an analogous reasoning for the more fundamental case of the constant @xmath137,we may also write ( 41 ) as the ratio of two velocities , as follows :    @xmath203    from where we have    @xmath204    where @xmath205 . in the newtonian ( classical ) universe , where @xmath206 and @xmath17,we have @xmath207 .",
    "so the coupling of fields is impossible . under einstein",
    "s theory ( relativistic theory),@xmath17 and we also have @xmath207,where , although electrodymanics is compatible with relativistic mechanics , gravitation is still not properly coupled to electrodynamics at quantum level . in the present model that breaks lorentz symmetry , where @xmath208,gravitation is coupled to electrodynamics of moving particles .",
    "the quantum uncertainties should naturally arise from such a symmetric space - time structure ( @xmath209),which will be denominated _ symmetrical special relativity _ ( ssr ) due to the existence of two limits of speed .    similarly to the bohr velocity ( @xmath210 ) for fundamental bound state ,",
    "the speed @xmath12 is also a universal fundamental constant , however",
    "the crucial difference between them is that @xmath12 is associated with a more fundamental bound state in the universe as a whole , since gravity ( @xmath162),which is the weakest interaction plays now an important role for the dynamics of the electron ( electrodynamics ) in such a space - time .",
    "this may be observed in ( 43 ) because , if we make @xmath211,we would have @xmath17 and so we will recover the case of the classical vacuum ( empty space or no background field ) .",
    "our aim is to postulate @xmath12 as an unattainable universal ( constant ) minimum speed associated with a privileged frame of background field , but before this , we must provide a better justification of why we consider the electron mass and charge to calculate @xmath12 @xmath212,instead of masses and charges of other particles .",
    "although there are fractionary electric charges as the case of quarks , such charges are not free in nature for bonding only with gravity .",
    "they are strongly connected by the strong force ( gluons ) .",
    "actually the charge of the electron is the smallest free charge in nature . besides this",
    ", the electron is the elementary charged particle with the smallest mass .",
    "therefore the product @xmath190 assumes a minimum value . and",
    "in addition to that , the electron is completely stable .",
    "other charged particles such as for instance @xmath213 and @xmath214 have masses that are greater than the electron mass , and they are unstable , decaying very quickly . such a subject may be dealt with more extensively in another article .",
    "we could think about a velocity @xmath215 @xmath216 that has origin from a purely gravitational interaction , however such a much lower bound state does not exist because the presence of electromagnetic interactions is essential at subatomic level . and",
    "since neutrino does not interact with electromagnetic field , it can not be considered to estimate @xmath12 .",
    "now we can verify that the minimum speed ( @xmath12 ) given in ( 43 ) is directly related to the minimum length of quantum gravity ( planck length),as follows :    @xmath217    where @xmath218 .    in ( 44),as @xmath219 is directly related to @xmath12 , if we make @xmath220 by considering @xmath211,this implies @xmath17 and thus we restore the case of the classical space - time in relativity .",
    "now we can notice that the universal constant of minimum speed @xmath12 in ( 44),associated with very low energies ( very large wavelengths ) is directly related to the universal constant of minimum length @xmath219 ( very high energies),whose invariance has been studied in dsr by magueijo , smolin , camelia et al [ 20 - 25 ] .",
    "the natural consequence of the presence of a more fundamental level associated with @xmath12 in the space - time is the existence of a privileged reference frame of background field in the universe .",
    "such a frame should be connected to a kind of vacuum energy , that is inherent to the space - time ( refer to @xmath151 in equation ( 33 ) ) .",
    "this idea reminds us of the conceptions of mach@xcite , schroedinger@xcite and assis@xcite , although such conceptions are still within the classical context .",
    "since we are assuming an absolute and privileged reference frame ( @xmath12 ) , which is underlying and also inherent to the whole space - time geometry , we shall call it ultra - referential-@xmath221 . by drawing inspiration from some of the non - conventional ideas of einstein in relation to the `` ether''@xcite ,",

    "this line of investigation resumes those non - conventional einstein s ideas @xcite@xcite , who attempted to bring back the idea of a new  ether \" that can not be conceived as composed of punctual particles and having a world line followed in the time .",
    "actually such an idea of `` ether '' as conceived by einstein should be understood as a non - classical concept of ether due essentially to its non - locality feature . in this sense",
    ", such a new `` ether '' has a certain correspondence with the ultra - referential @xmath221 due to its totality as a physical space , not showing any movement .",
    "in fact , as @xmath221 would be absolutely unattainable for all particles ( at local level),@xmath12 would prohibits to think about a perfect plane wave ( @xmath222),since it is an idealized case associated with the perfect equilibrium of a free particle ( @xmath223 ) .",
    "so the ultra - referential @xmath221 would really be non - local ( @xmath222),which is in agreement with that einstein s conception about an `` ether '' that could not be split into isolated parts and which , due to its totality in the space , would give us the impression that it is actually stationary .",
    "_ in order to understand better its non - locality feature by using a symmetry reasoning , we must perceive that such a minimum limit @xmath12 works in a reciprocal way when compared with the maximum limit @xmath0,so that particles supposed in such a limit @xmath12,in contrast of what would happen in the limit @xmath0,would become completely `` defrosted '' in the space ( @xmath224 ) and time ( @xmath225),being in anywhere in the space - time and therefore having a non - local behavior .",
    "this super ideal condition corresponds to the ultra - referential @xmath221_,at which the particle would have an infinite de - broglie wavelength , being completely spread out in the whole space .",
    "this state coincides with the background field for @xmath221 , however @xmath221 is unattainable for all the particles .    in vain ,",
    "einstein attempted to satisfactorily redeem the idea of a new  ether \" under relativity in various manners@xcite because , in effect , his theory was nt still able to adequately implement the quantum uncertainties as he also tried to do@xcite , and in this respect , relativity is still a classical theory , although the new conception of  ether \" presented a few non - classical characteristics .",
    "actually it was einstein who coined the term _ ultra - referential _ as the fundamental aspect of reality .",
    "to him , the existence of an ultra - referential can not be identified with none of the reference frames in view of the fact that it is a privileged one in respect of the others .",
    "this seems to contradict the principle of relativity , but , in vain , einstein attempted to find a relativistic  ether \" ( physical - space),that is inherent to the geometry of the space - time , which does not contradict such a principle .",

    "the present work seeks to naturally implement the quantum principles into the space - time .",
    "thanks to the current investigation , we shall notice that einstein s non - conventional ideas about the relativistic  ether \" and also his vision@xcite of making quantum principles to emerge naturally from a unified field theory become closely related between themselves .",
    "the conception of background privileged reference frame ( ultra - referential @xmath221 ) has deep new implications for our understanding of reference systems .",
    "that classical notion we have about the inertial ( galilean ) reference frames , where the idea of rest exists , is eliminated at quantum level , where gravity plays a fundamental role for such a space - time with a vacuum energy associated with @xmath221 ( @xmath226 ) .    before we deal with the implications due to the implementation of such a ultra - referential @xmath221 in the space - time at quantum level ,",
    "let us make a brief presentation of the meaning of the galilean reference frame ( reference space),well - known in special relativity .",
    "in accordance with that theory , when an observer assumes an infinite number of points at rest in relation to himself , he introduces his own reference space @xmath227 .",
    "thus , for another observer @xmath228 who is moving with a speed @xmath229 in relation to @xmath227 , there should also exist an infinite number of points at rest at his own reference frame .",
    "therefore , for the observer @xmath228,the reference space @xmath227 is not standing still and it has its points moving at a speed @xmath230 .",
    "for this reason , in accordance with the principle of relativity , there is no privileged galilean reference frame at absolute rest , since the reference space of a given observer becomes movement for another one .",
    "the absolute space of pre - einsteinian physics , connected to the ether in the old sense , also constitutes by itself a reference space .",
    "such a space was assumed as the privileged reference space of the absolute rest .",
    "however , as it was also essentially a galilean reference space like any other , comprised of a set of points at rest , actually it was also subjected to the notion of movement .",
    "the idea of movement could be applied to the `` absolute space '' when , for instance , we assume an observer on earth , which is moving with a speed @xmath229 in relation to such a space . in this case , for an observer at rest on earth , the points that would constitute the absolute space of reference would be moving at a speed of @xmath230 .",
    "since such an absolute space was connected to the old ether , the earth - bound observer should detect a flow of ether @xmath230,however the michelson - morley experiment has not detected such an ether .",
    "einstein has denied the existence of the ether associated with a privileged reference frame because it has contradicted the principle of relativity .",
    "therefore this idea of a galilean ether is superfluous , as it would also merely be a reference space constituted by points at rest , as well as any other . in this respect ,",
    "there is nothing special in such a classical ( luminiferous ) ether .",
    "however , motivated by the provocation from h. lorentz and ph .",
    "lenard lorentz@xcite , einstein attempted to introduce several new conceptions of a new `` ether'',which did not contradict the principle of relativity .",
    "after 1925,he started using the word `` ether '' less and less frequently , although he still wrote in 1938:_``this word ` ether ' has changed its meaning many times , in the development of science ... its history , by no means finished , is continued by relativity theory@xcite ... ' ' _ .    in 1916,after the final formulation of gr , einstein proposed a completely new concept of ether .",
    "such a new  ether \" was a relativistic ",
    "ether\",which described space - time as a _ sui generis",
    "_ material medium , which in no way could constitute a reference space subjected to the relative notion of movement .",
    "basically , the essential characteristics of the new  ether \" as interpreted by einstein can be summarized as follow :    -_it constitutes a fundamental ultra - referential of reality , which is identified with the physical space , being a relativistic ether , i.e .",
    ", it is covariant because the notion of movement can not be applied to it , which represents a kind of absolute background field that is inherent to the metric @xmath231 of the space - time_.    -_it is not composed of points or particles , therefore it can not be understood as a galilean reference space for the hypothetical absolute space . for this reason , it does not contradict the well - known principle of relativity_.    -_it is not composed of parts , thus its indivisibility reminds the idea of non - locality_.    -_it constitutes a medium which is really incomparable with any ponderable medium constituted of particles , atoms or molecules .",
    "not even the background cosmic radiation of the universe can represent exactly such a medium as an absolute reference system ( ultra - referential)@xcite _ .",
    "-_it plays an active role on the physical phenomena@xcite  @xcite .",
    "_ in accordance with einstein , it is impossible to formulate a complete physical theory without the assumption of an `` ether''(a kind of non - local vacuum field ) , because a complete physical theory must take into consideration real properties of the space - time .    the present work attempts to follow this line of reasoning that einstein did not finish , providing a new model with respect to the fundamental idea of unification , namely the electrodynamics of a charged particle ( electron ) moving in a gravitational field .",
    "as we have interpreted the lowest limit @xmath12 ( formulas ( 43 ) and ( 44 ) ) as unattainable and constant ( invariant),such a limit should be associated with a privileged non - galilean reference system , since @xmath12 must remain invariant for any frame with @xmath232 . as a consequence of such a covariance of the relativistic  ether \" @xmath221,new speed transformations",

    "hence , due to such an asymmetry , the flow @xmath230 of the `` ether '' @xmath221 does not exist and therefore , in this sense , it mantains covariant ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this asymmetry breaks that equivalence by exchange of reference frame @xmath227 for @xmath228 through an inverse transformation .",
    "such a breakdown of symmetry by an inverse transformation breaks lorentz symmetry due to the presence of the background field for @xmath221 ( section 6 ) .",
    "there is no galilean reference system in such a space - time , where the ultra - referential @xmath221 is a non - galilean reference system and in addition a privileged one ( covariant),exactly as is the speed of light @xmath0 .",
    "thus the new transformations of speed shall also show that @xmath236 ( section 6 ) and @xmath237 ( section 6 ) .",
    "actually , if we make @xmath17,we therefore recover the validity of the galilean reference frame of special relativity ( sr),where only the invariance of @xmath0 remains . in this classical case ( sr),we have reference systems constituted by a set of points at rest or essentially by macroscopic objects .",
    "now , it is interesting to notice that sr contains two postulates which conceptually exclude each other in a certain sense , namely :    \\1 ) -_the equivalence of the inertial reference frames ( with @xmath5 ) is essentially due to the fact that we have galilean reference frames , where @xmath238 , since it is always possible to introduce a set of points at relative rest and , consequently , for this reason , we can exchange @xmath229 for @xmath230 by symmetry through inverse transformations . _",

    "such a frame @xmath246 ( for @xmath248 with respect to @xmath221 ) plays the similar role of a `` rest'',in the sense that we restore all the newtonian parameters of the particles , such as the proper time interval @xmath249,i.e.,@xmath250(@xmath251)=@xmath249,the mass @xmath78 , i.e.,@xmath252,among others .",

    "in such an interval ( @xmath265),we will see that @xmath266 ( see equations ( 60),(72 ) and fig.7 ) . _ ]    in general , we should have the total interval @xmath243 for @xmath228 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "in short we say that both of the frames @xmath221 and @xmath246 are already fixed or universal , whereas @xmath228 is a rolling frame to describe the variations of the moving state of the particle within such a total interval . since the rolling frame @xmath228 is not a galilean one due to the impossibility to find a set of points at rest on it , we can not place the particle exactly on the origin @xmath267,since there would be no exact location on @xmath268 ( @xmath267 ) ( an uncertainty @xmath269 : see figure 3 ) .",

    "for this reason , as a classical observer ( local and macroscopic ) is always at rest ( @xmath8 ) in his proper reference frame @xmath227,he measures and interprets @xmath41 without accuracy because his frame is galilean,_being related essentially to macroscopic systems ( a set of points at rest)_,whereas on the other hand , non - galilean reference frames for representing subatomic world in ssr are really always moving for any transformation in such a space - time _ and therefore can not be related to a set of points at rest_. due to this _ conceptual discrepancy between the nature of non - galilean reference frames in ssr ( no rest ) and the nature of galilean reference frames in sr for classical observes ( with rest)_,the total energy @xmath41 in ssr ( eq.(72 ) ) behaves as an uncertainty @xmath169 for such classical observers at rest , i.e.,@xmath41 ( for @xmath221 ) @xmath492 ( for any galilean-@xmath227 at rest ) .",
