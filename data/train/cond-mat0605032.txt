    "a traveling charged particle induces coherent radiation when it passes near a periodic dielectric structure along the direction of its spatial periodicity .",
    "this radiation , called smith - purcell radiation ( spr ) @xcite , can be a novel radiation source with several remarkable properties .",
    "the most important one is the scalability of the output frequency ; the threshold frequency below which spr is kinetically impossible varies in inverse proportion to the magnitude of the period .",
    "in addition , the spr is characterized by the presence of resonances at a series of frequencies , which again vary in inverse proportion to the period .",
    "owing to these properties , it has been recognized that spr can be a basic mechanism for a compact free - electron laser @xcite .",
    "since its first observation , spr has been studied using mainly metallic diffraction gratings of one - dimensional periodicity @xcite . in most theoretical analyses made so far ,",
    "the gratings have been treated as perfect conductors to simplify the treatment of the periodic light scattering @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "wood s anomaly @xcite in the optical density of states ( odos ) is responsible for the enhanced signals of spr , and thus the relevant frequencies of the resonances are determined in a straightforward manner using simple kinetics .",
    "recently , both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite spr results have been reported for photonic crystals ( phcs ) used in place of metal gratings .",
    "it was found that phcs induced highly coherent spr because of their multidimensional periodicity in their dielectric functions .",
    "the spr spectrum consists of point - like signals as a function of frequency , which show up each time the evanescent light from the electron excites a photonic band ( phb ) mode of high quality factor .",
    "spr from a phc is versatile , because phcs generally have various parameters , which can now be reliably designed and changed .",
    "however , when an electron beam of ultra - relativistic velocity was used in combination with a phc , which was finite in the direction of the electron trajectory , unexpected phenomena that contradicted the conventional understanding of the spr were experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "such phenomena have not been observed in the gratings of nearly perfect conductors and are expected to be absent even in phcs when an electron beam of slower velocity is used .",
    "this spr , called unconventional spr ( uspr ) in this paper , is quite distinct in many ways from the conventional spr ( cspr ) and thus is easily identified ; most importantly , the uspr spectrum sweeps the entire region of frequency - momentum phase space , in contrast to the cspr which carries information of the phase space only along the shifted @xmath0 lines , to be defined later . in the phase space , the uspr is characterized by peculiar resonances arising along curves , which are related more or less to the dispersion relations of phbs , not to the shifted @xmath0 lines , with relatively little intensity variation . therefore , spr in the ultra - relativistic regime of the beam velocity is potentially useful both as a monochromatic light source and as a probe to investigate the phb structure .",
    "we should note here that the cherenkov effect also can be used to probe the phb structure with the angle - resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the conjecture inferred by the experiment , which this paper seeks to verify , was that the spr consists of the cspr and uspr in the relativistic regime of electron velocity and that the uspr is expected to disappear gradually with decreasing velocity , to leave solely the cspr component for velocities typically less than a few hundred kev .",
    "very recently , kesar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported a systematic discrepancy between the calculated spr spectrum in a finite - size grating and that of the conventional theory assuming infinite size .",
    "since they focused on the diffraction grating of a perfect conductor , their discrepancy is not directly related to ours , which arises in systems involving phcs with a finite dielectric constant . as for this point , it is noteworthy that a rigorous theory was developed for finite - size grating of infinitely - thin metallic plates @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the uspr for the phcs composed of a finite number of cylinders .",
    "we use the multiple - scattering method of theoretical treatment @xcite , which explicitly takes into account the finiteness of the total number of cylinders and treats exactly the multiple mie scattering among them .",
    "we shall investigate the properties of the uspr and the interplay between u and c sprs by changing various parameters , such as electron velocity , dielectric constant of phcs , length of phcs , thickness of phcs and angle of spr emission .",
    "most of this paper will focus on the phcs of dielectric cylinders of circular cross section .",
    "the remarkable difference of the present work from the previous theoretical works involving phcs lies in the fact that we are dealing with the finiteness of the length of phc in the direction of the electron beam .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the kinetics for both cspr and uspr and discuss what plays a key role in inducing uspr .",

    "iv , we present detailed analyses of uspr by changing various parameters . finally , we summarize the results in sec . v.",

    "the trajectory of the electron is parallel to the direction of the periodicity .",
    "angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the polar angles of the spr signals .",
    "this phc has a mirror plane indicated by dotted line in the right panel.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    cylinders are arrayed periodically ( lattice constant : @xmath5 ) in the @xmath8 direction with cylinder axes in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "an electron travels near the phc in a trajectory parallel to the @xmath8 axis with velocity @xmath0 and impact parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we obtain the spr spectrum from this system as a sum of the plane - wave signals generated by the scattering of the evanescent light emitted by the electron .",
    "the whole process of multiple scattering among a finite number of cylinders is dealt with compactly by the multiple - scattering theory of radiation using the vector cylindrical waves as a basis of representation @xcite .",
    "let us briefly summarize the kinetics in the theory of cspr . in the theory of cspr , a finite periodic structure is simulated by a periodic structure of infinite length in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "a traveling electron accompanies the radiation field that is a superposition of evanescent waves with respect to frequency @xmath9 and wave number @xmath10 in the @xmath2 direction @xcite .",
    "the wave vector of each evanescent wave is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is purely imaginary because @xmath13 .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath14 determines the spatial decay of the evanescent wave incident on the phc . in what follows ,",
    "it is important to remember the feature of @xmath15 that , in the ultimate limit @xmath16 , @xmath14 tends to zero . since @xmath9 and @xmath10 are conserved quantities in the geometry of fig .",
    "[ geometry ] , the evanescent waves with different @xmath9 and @xmath10 are independent in the whole scattering process .",
    "thus , the incident light of @xmath9 and @xmath10 leaves the phc , after being scattered , with the same @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the spr signals observed in the @xmath17 plane may be analyzed by setting @xmath15 everywhere .",
    "since we are now dealing with a perfect periodicity extending from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , we obtain the spr signal in the form of bragg - scattered waves summed over the diffraction channels .",
    "the channels are specified by the wave vector @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is a reciprocal lattice point of the phc in the @xmath8 direction . before the scattering by the phc , @xmath9 and @xmath23 , the @xmath8 component of the wavevector of light , satisfy the relation @xmath24 .",
    "the line @xmath25 , called the @xmath0 line in this paper , lies outside the light cone in the phase space @xmath26 .",
    "after the scattering , the @xmath8 component of the light of channel @xmath27 becomes @xmath28 .",
    "the shifted @xmath0 line defined by this equation is inside the light cone in a certain frequency range . in that frequency range",
    "we can detect the spr signal in this channel at a far - field observation point .",
    "the propagating direction of the spr signal of @xmath9 is given by @xmath29 in the polar coordinates defined in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "the inside region of the light cone is the leaky region of phbs , and , accordingly , the odos is nontrivial there . actually , odos has a sequence of peaks of finite width in the @xmath30 space .",
    "the peak position determines the dispersion relations @xmath31 of the quasi - guided phb modes .",
    "imagine temporarily @xmath15 , for brevity .",
    "the presence of the modes in the @xmath26 space significantly affects the spr spectrum by causing a sharp resonance when the dispersion curves of phbs intersect the shifted @xmath0 lines .",
    "the resonance becomes sharper as the quality factor of the relevant phb modes increases @xcite .",
    "therefore , the spr from a phc can have very high quality , which is intriguing as a new possibility of phc .    in the above argument",
    ", we assumed the conservation of @xmath23 , with an umklapp allowance taken into account . in an actual phc with a finite number @xmath32 of cylinders ,",
    "the periodicity or the translational invariance of the whole system is lost at the sample edges .",
    "one way to take account of the finiteness of @xmath32 is to treat @xmath23 as defined only approximately with a width of the order of @xmath33 @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the shifted @xmath0 lines are considered to have the finite width , and the phb dispersion relation will become detectable within this allowance centering on the shifted @xmath0 lines of open channels . in reality , however , the uspr signals appear in the phase space @xmath26 with a much larger distribution than this straightforward @xmath34 blurring @xcite .",
    "let us now consider an ultra - relativistic velocity @xmath35 .",
    "we continue to confine ourselves to the measurement within the @xmath17 plane , i.e. , @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", @xmath12 is almost zero , and the evanescent wave incident on the phc may be regarded practically as a plane wave with its wavevector directed in the x - direction .",
    "schematic illustration of the input evanescent light yielding conventional ( left panel ) and unconventional ( right panel ) sprs .",
    "the conventional spr is produced when the evanescent wave has an appreciable decay constant .",
    "the incident light enters the phc from below .",
    "the unconventional case arises when the incident evanescent light has a negligible decay constant and is regarded as a plane wave entering the phc from its left edge . in this case , the evanescent wave is almost symmetric with respect to the mirror plane , inducing the even - parity selection rule in the phb excitation .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    therefore , the light - scattering problem is quite similar to that of the light transmission and reflection in the @xmath8 direction through the periodic array of cylinders , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ unconventional ] .",
    "in this situation , it is obvious that the sample edges play a crucial role .",
    "in particular , we know that @xmath23 is no longer a good quantum number , no matter how large the total number of the cylinders may be . as in an ordinary light - transmission experiment involving phcs , we expect the incident wave of frequency @xmath9 to excite the phb modes at the crossing points between the line of constant @xmath9 and the dispersion curves @xmath36 of phbs in the @xmath37 plane .",
    "the point is that the wave vector of the phb thus determined is not related to the value of @xmath23 on the @xmath0 line of the incident light .",
    "therefore , we should expect spr signals over the entire @xmath26 space , not necessarily restricted along the shifted @xmath0 lines .",
    "the signals expected off the shifted @xmath0 lines characterize the uspr .",
    "also , we can expect that the transmitted spr obtained in the side opposite to the trajectory is almost identical to the reflected spr of the trajectory side . finally ,",
    "similar to the ordinary setup of a plane wave transmitting through a two- and three - dimensional phc @xcite , a selection rule must exist for the symmetry of the phb modes to be excited .",
    "the phc in our problem has a symmetry with respect to the mirror reflection @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the plane bisecting the phc ) , and in the ultra - relativistic regime the incident light is of @xmath40 independent .",
    "hence , solely the phb modes of even mirror - symmetry are expected to participate in the resonant light scattering .",
    "the even - parity selection rule will thus characterize uspr spectra .    according to this scenario ,",
    "a phb mode manifests itself in the uspr .",
    "therefore , the uspr will have a rather broad band as a function of frequency .",
    "this is in contrast to the cspr , in which excited phb modes give rise to sharp resonance peaks only along the shifted @xmath0 lines .",
    "in addition , since @xmath35 , the shifted @xmath0 lines coincide with the threshold lines for the opening of a new bragg diffraction channel .",
    "the channel opening often leaves a singular trace due to wood s anomaly in the line shape of wave scattering .",
    "thus , on our shifted @xmath0 lines , wood s anomaly will occur , together with the resonance peaks of the cspr associated with the phb excitation . in this way",
    ", the spectra of the c and u sprs reveal a quite rich structure when the electron is ultra - relativistic .",
    "so far , we have concentrate ourselves on the electron traveling parallel to the @xmath8 direction , that is , the direction of the periodicity of the phc under consideration . if the velocity vector @xmath41 of the electron is given by @xmath42 the kinetics of spr changes accordingly .",
    "in particular , the dominant component of wave number @xmath10 depends on frequency and is given by @xmath43 .",
    "within the conventional theory the spr acquires a significant enhancement when the following three conditions are fulfilled : @xmath44 where the first equation defines the shifted @xmath0 line at nonzero @xmath45 . as in the case of @xmath46 , this scenario of",
    "the spr is insufficient for an ultra - relativistic electron . in this case",
    "the evanescent wave accompanied by the electron can be effectively treated as a plane wave propagating parallel to @xmath41 .",
    "this highlights the role of the sample edge of the finite - size phc , namely , the broken translational invariance , and the photonic band modes on the entire plane of @xmath47 are excited , not necessary restricted on the shifted @xmath0 lines . in the limiting case of vanishing @xmath48 , the electron travels parallel to the cylindrical axis .",
    "there , no propagating radiation is generated from the phc , as far as the cylinders have infinite length in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "this is due to the perfect translational invariance along the axis . in actual phc , however , this translational invariance is broken , yielding a sort of the diffraction radiation .",
    "thus , as @xmath49 varies from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , the conventional theory of the spr , which assumes the translational invariance both in the @xmath8 and @xmath2 direction , predicts a gradual disappearance of the spr . on the other hand , the uspr gives a novel radiation irrespective of @xmath49 , in which the broken translational invariance in the @xmath8 direction is highlighted at small @xmath49 , and that in the @xmath2 direction is highlighted around @xmath52 .",
    "to summarize , the two spr spectra , c and u sprs , coexist in the ultra - relativistic regime , when a phc sample is used . to analyze the experimental signals based on the knowledge on the band structure of photons ,",
    "the length of the phc or the total number of cylinders must be finite but large enough . for a finite system to have a band structure comparable to that obtained for an infinite system , the periods of",
    ", @xmath53 will be enough according to our experience .",
    "in contrast to the value of @xmath32 in the @xmath8 direction , however , we are considering a system having small size in the @xmath40 direction , such as a phc made of a monolayer or stacked layers of several monolayers .",
    "the finite size in the @xmath40 direction needs to be considered explicitly to obtain the band structure of our phcs .",
    "before making a detailed study of the uspr properties , we briefly compare the cspr spectrum with the uspr spectrum , using the numerical results for a test system .",

    "the uspr signals are suppressed as follows .",
    "the light of @xmath57 is literally evanescent with an appreciable decay constant @xmath14 , so that , while passing through the phc in the @xmath79 direction , the incident light decays much and sees only the surface region of cylinders .",

    ", it is interesting to investigate the @xmath32-dependence of the uspr in detail .",
    "the number of stacking layers ( @xmath80 ) is also an important factor because odos and thus the phb structure depends crucially on @xmath80 .",

    "an obvious but nonessential @xmath0-dependence is an increase of the spr intensity due to the @xmath0 dependence of the decay - constant @xmath14 ; if impact parameter @xmath1 is fixed , the overall spr spectrum behaves as @xmath86 . to eliminate this trivial @xmath0-dependence ,",

    "the intensity contrast of the spr is quite strong at low frequencies . in particular a point - like resonance",
    "is seen at @xmath92 .",
    "as panel ( b ) shows , this resonance arises just at a crossing between the dispersion curve of an even - parity phb and the shifted @xmath0 line of @xmath63 .",

    "this feature is common to all the horizontal streaks appearing at the frequencies of the pseudo gaps .",
    "these are signals of type ( e ) of the uspr .",
    "we should note that the phb mode , which crosses the shifted @xmath0 lines , has a negative group velocity , and the excited phb mode propagates in the @xmath93 direction . a backward - oriented diffraction taking place at the left edge of the phc explains the tendency towards the line @xmath72 .",

    "the curves are in fact coincident with the dispersion curves of quasi - guided phb of the even parity .",
    "therefore , they are type ( b ) signals .",
    "note that the odd - parity phb dispersion curves are also visible , with reduced strength as compared to the even - parity phbs .",
    "altogether , at @xmath91 , cspr coexists with uspr and odd - parity phbs are seen in the uspr spectrum , with weaker intensity than even - parity phbs , however . combining this result with what we have seen in sec .",
    "iii for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we may conclude that , as @xmath0 increases from @xmath57 , the uspr becomes visible and the even - parity selection rule of uspr is less stringent at non - ultra - relativistic velocities .",

    "therefore , although the even - parity selection rule is indeed dominant , it is somewhat relaxed for @xmath95 . on the shifted @xmath0 line , there are signals of cspr , as theory predicted for type ( a ) features in sec .",
    "the breakdown of the even - parity selection rule at these velocities is explained as follows . with a decrease of @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath14 increases to make the incident evanescent light decay more quickly when passing the monolayer .",
    "this increases the asymmetry of the evanescent wave with respect to the mirror plane and makes the even - parity selection rule less effective .",
    "the degree of the symmetry of the input wave may be given by the factor @xmath96 , called here the symmetry factor , which measures the decay of the evanescent wave while traversing the phc in the @xmath79 direction . if this factor is unity , the evanescent light seen by the phc is mirror - symmetric . at @xmath95 ,",
    "the symmetry factor is 0.408 at @xmath97 and too small to guarantee strictly the even - parity selection rule .",
    "therefore , odd - parity phbs are allowed somewhat as uspr signals .",
    "the results for the other @xmath0 are briefly summarized without giving numerical results . at @xmath98 ,",
    "when the symmetry factor is 0.047 , cspr and uspr coexist and odd - parity phbs are seen in the latter . at @xmath99 , the asymmetry factor increases to 0.755 .",
    "the intensity map gradually tends to the case of @xmath58 with the symmetry factor 0.972 ; signals along the odd - parity phbs disappear , leaving behind only the even - parity signals as type ( b ) signals .",
    "the horizontal bright streaks appear solely in the regions of the pseudo - gaps of even - parity bands .",

    "the critical velocity of the electron , above which the uspr begins to emerge does not change so much by non - zero @xmath45 .",
    "an important point is that at ultra - relativistic velocities the evanescent wave can be effectively regarded as a plane wave .",
    "this is not controlled by @xmath45 , but is controlled by @xmath0 , the magnitude of the velocity vector .",
    "however , other features of the uspr changes as discussed in the previous section .    in conclusion , in the frequency region @xmath100",
    ", the uspr is conspicuous when @xmath0 exceeds 0.7c , and the even - parity selection rule holds progressively better as @xmath0 approaches @xmath101 from @xmath102 .      for a phc with @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath32 kept fixed at @xmath103 and @xmath67 , let us examine how the spr spectrum varies as the dielectric constant @xmath4 of the cylinders changes in the monolayer .",
    "we select three values of @xmath4 , @xmath104 and @xmath18 .",
    "the first case corresponds to the dielectric constant of fused quartz with @xmath4 nearly twice as large as that used above , the second is the dielectric constant of a drude metal with @xmath105 the plasma frequency , and the third is the dielectric constant of a perfect conductor .",
    "to avoid the poor convergence of the cylindrical - wave expansion for the metallic cylinders in contact , we created a narrow opening between the cylinders by setting @xmath106 in the drude case .",
    "we assumed @xmath107 , i.e. , the plasma wavelength equals the lattice constant .",
    "calculation is made for the monolayer system using @xmath58 and @xmath60 , as before .",
    "the reflected spr intensity maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ spr_eps ] , together with the corresponding phb structure obtained for the @xmath74 system .        panels ( a ) and ( b ) depict the result of dielectric cylinders , panels ( c ) and ( d ) treat the drude cylinders , and panel ( e ) presents the spectrum of the cylinders of a perfect conductor . panels ( b ) and ( d ) also involve the band structures of the monolayer .",
    "considering @xmath0 is ultra - relativistic , we only plotted the even - parity phb structure .",
    "note that for the perfect conductor case of panel ( e ) , the odos does not present any peaks except for wood s anomaly and the phb structure is completely absent .",
    "clearly , the calculated uspr intensity shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) is well correlated with the phb structure .",
    "namely , the bright curves of strong spr intensity are type ( b ) signals having a positive slope and tracing very well the even - parity phb dispersion curves .",
    "in addition , we can recognize type ( e ) signals of the bright flat lines terminated at the backward light line , which are seen just at the frequencies of the pseudo - gaps .",
    "these features agree with what we have seen in sec .",
    "most importantly , the phb structure with larger dielectric constant is indeed probed by the uspr .",
    "as for the drude case shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) , the phb structure is composed of many flat bands .",
    "these phb modes have their origin in the tight - binding coupling among cylinders of the surface plasmon polaritons ( spp ) , localized on each cylinder surface @xcite .",
    "the calculated intensity map demonstrates that these spp bands are coupled only weakly to the incoming evanescent wave .",
    "in contrast , the phb around @xmath108 , which has a modest group velocity , is strongly coupled to the evanescent wave , yielding a very strong spr signal .",
    "we thus conclude that uspr carries information of phbs of spp origin .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ spr_eps](e ) the strong intensity of the spr arises solely on the shifted @xmath0 lines .",
    "this reflects the absence of the phb structure in the array of perfect - conductor cylinders .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the uspr is peculiar to dielectric and metallic phcs with finite dielectric function and is completely absent in the systems without phbs .      in the numerical results shown so far ,",
    "the number of the cylinders is fixed at either @xmath67 or @xmath74 . at small @xmath32 , typically less than 8 , the phb structure is not clearly visible in the intensity map of the spr on the @xmath37 plane . on the other hand , at large @xmath32",
    "the phb structure is clearly visible as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ unconv_teflon ] and [ unconv_teflon_pb ] . in this region , however , change of the spr intensity map with increasing @xmath32 is less remarkable . nevertheless ,",
    "if we have a close look at the spectral line shapes of the uspr , they indeed change with @xmath32 .",
    "to investigate this feature , we consider the spr spectra at a fixed solid angle @xmath109 as a function of frequency .",
    "figure [ n - dependence ] shows the spectra for various @xmath32 .",
    "the reflected spr intensity spectra at @xmath109 from finite - size phcs of various @xmath32 . the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ conv_teflon ] were used except for @xmath32 .",

    "( [ polar - angle ] ) ) and the phb structure @xmath36 .",
    "the intersection point is off the shifted @xmath0 lines and thus is indeed an uspr signal .",
    "we can clearly observe that as @xmath32 increases , the intensity at the peak grows but seems to be saturated to a certain value .",
    "this implies that the radiation intensity of the uspr per unit length of the electron trajectory decreases at large @xmath32 and eventually vanishes at @xmath74 .",
    "this property is reasonable because the uspr is completely forbidden in the system of perfect translational invariance with @xmath74 .",
    "on the other hand , we also found that the intensity of the cspr on the shifted @xmath0 lines increases almost linearly with @xmath32 , as expected from the conventional theory of the spr .",
    "therefore , at very large @xmath32 the cspr signals will dominate over the uspr ones .",
    "however , even at @xmath112 we found that the spr intensity map does not differ so much from fig .",
    "[ unconv_teflon ] , in which the uspr signals are rather stronger than the cspr ones . besides , in fig .",
    "[ n - dependence ] we can clearly observe that the spectral width of the peak decreases with increasing @xmath32 .",
    "this property reflects better confinement of the radiation energy for larger @xmath32 .",
    "this width should converge to a certain value at @xmath74 , which is inversely proportional to the life - time of the relevant photonic band mode .",
    "this is nothing but the homogeneous broadening of the spectral line width of the uspr .",
    "so far we have confined ourselves to the monolayer phc .",
    "now let us stack the identical monolayers periodically in the @xmath40 direction .",
    "as we increase the number @xmath80 of the stacking layers , the odos reveals a progressively finer structure as a function of frequency .",
    "each peak of odos corresponds to a quasi - guided phb mode confined in the stacked layers .",
    "the typical peak - to - peak distance in frequency is inversely proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , each peak is generally getting sharper .",
    "if @xmath80 is large enough , the scattering of the evanescent wave in the ultra - relativistic regime is identical to the transmission and reflection of a te - polarized plane wave that enters the phc with its left edge as an entrance surface .",
    "the slab phc in question has a finite thickness @xmath113 in the @xmath8 direction and has a large extension in the @xmath40 direction with the entrance surface parallel to the @xmath114 plane .",
    "the wave vector component @xmath115 parallel to the entrance surface is conserved , and the incident plane wave excites the bulk phb modes having the same @xmath115 . there is no momentum conservation in the @xmath8 component ; in principle the light excites any phb modes of arbitrary @xmath23 .",
    "the scattered wave is decomposed into diffraction channels @xcite .",
    "let us examine the stacked monolayers with a square lattice of the cylinders . for uspr",
    ", @xmath116 plays the role of @xmath115 in the above analogy , and thus we may set @xmath117 in the ultra - relativistic case , provided @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , the incident plane wave has the wave vectors @xmath118 and propagates in the @xmath119 direction of the square lattice .",
    "the bulk phb modes along @xmath119 are thus excited .",
    "the conclusion is thus that uspr will carry information along @xmath119 of the bulk phb modes if both @xmath32 and @xmath80 are sufficiently large .",
    "according to the above arguments , the spr intensity is expected to be enhanced in the forward and backward directions , which correspond to the specular transmission and reflection .",
    "in addition , if @xmath120 , the spr intensity is expected to be enhanced also on the curves @xmath121 which correspond to the diffraction channels associated with the reciprocal lattice points @xmath122 along the @xmath123 axis .",

    "as before , we plotted only the even - parity phb structure . in the double layer , the mirror plane lies midway between the layers .",
    "we see the number of bands is almost twice that of the monolayer band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ teflon_band ] .",
    "this is reasonable , since the degenerate band - structures of each of the monolayers are split in the double layer .",
    "obviously there is a very good correlation of the strong signals of uspr with the band structure of the even parity .",

    "we consider this to be a test system simulating the slab - type phc of square lattices .",

    ", the strong signals correspond to the anti - crossing points of the even - parity phb structure .",
    "the bright curve connected to the strong signal around @xmath129 is shown to be along the phb dispersion curve .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the intensity map of the uspr correlates well with the corresponding phb structure even in the case of stacked monolayers .",
    "so far , we have considered the case of @xmath15 ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) , that is , we have examined the radiation emitted within the @xmath17 plane .",
    "we here investigate the @xmath7 dependence . for this purpose , we write the differential cross section of spr in polar coordinates @xcite @xmath132 obviously , the cross section must have inversion symmetry under the operation @xmath133 , reflecting the inversion symmetry of the @xmath2 coordinate with respect to the electron trajectory located at @xmath134 .",
    "the radiation emission of non - vanishing @xmath10 is generally small compared with that of @xmath15 , and @xmath10 is a conserved quantity in the scattering by the phc .",
    "therefore , the @xmath10 dependence of the observed spr will be controlled dominantly by that of the decaying exponential @xmath135 of the initial light .",
    "this exponential decreases with increasing @xmath136 , so that the radiation is dominated by the spr of @xmath15 .",
    "let us consider the radiation emission toward solid angle @xmath137 . in the ultra - relativistic regime",
    "it follows that @xmath138 thus , the spr cross section at a given @xmath9 and @xmath139 is dominated in the forward ( @xmath140 ) and backward ( @xmath141 ) directions .",
    "similarly , at a given @xmath6 , the spr cross section is dominated around the plane perpendicular ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) to the cylindrical axis .",
    "figure [ tilte](a ) projects the reflected spr spectrum eq .",
    "( [ dcs ] ) for @xmath142 onto the @xmath37 plane , and fig .",
    "[ tilte ] ( b ) projects the reflected spr spectrum for @xmath143 is projected onto the @xmath144 plane .",
    "figure [ tilte](a ) verifies that the strong intensity is limited around the forward and backward light lines , as asserted above .",
    "the intensity contrast along the backward light line is related to the phb structure with finite @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ tilte](b ) , the strong spr intensity is limited around @xmath15 . at @xmath15 , three marked peaks can be found at @xmath145 and 1.5 .",
    "they correspond to the crossing points between the bright curves of fig .",
    "[ unconv_teflon ] and the line of @xmath146 ( i.e. , @xmath143 ) .",
    "thus , we can conclude that spr is highly directive within the plane normal to the cylindrical axis .",
    "to summarize , we have presented a theory of uspr that arises when an ultra - relativistic electron beam is used to obtain the spr from a finite phc composed of cylinders .",
    "the ultra - relativistic electron accompanies an evanescent wave whose spatial decay is almost negligible at @xmath15 , so that the evanescent wave can be regarded as a plane wave propagating in the direction of the trajectory .",
    "this yields a peculiar radiation emission from the phcs , which can not be explained by the conventional theory of the spr in which the finiteness of phc is treated as infinite .",
    "the spectrum of the uspr can be used as a probe of the phb structure of the quasi - guided modes having the even - parity symmetry with respect to the relevant mirror plane .",
    "we have also presented properties of the uspr in detail by changing several system parameters .",
    "we found that the uspr coexists with the cspr at moderate velocities typically in between @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "we also found that the uspr is completely absent in the perfect - conductor cylinders because of the absence of phbs .",
    "otherwise , the spectra of the uspr correlate with the corresponding phb structure very well .",
    "we also found that the cross section of the spr at an ultra - relativistic velocity is highly directive within the plane normal to the cylindrical axis .",
    "it should be emphasized again that the uspr is an unexpected phenomenon , in which the conventional theory assuming infinite periodicity of the phcs fails to reproduce its features . on the other hand",
    ", the present theory explains very well both the c and u sprs in a unified manner .",
    "there are three key items in the uspr : presence of phbs , broken translational invariance of phc , and ultra - relativistic velocity of the electron beam .",
    "lack of either one of the three items prevents understanding of the uspr correctly .    in actual phcs various types of disorder or randomness",
    "are inevitable , yielding the inhomogeneous broadening of spectral line width of the spr .",
    "for instance , a rigid vibration of constituent cylinders of the phc gives rise to the brillouin scattering . as a result",
    ", the broadening of the line width is given by the frequency of the vibration .",
    "the relative percentages of various disorder factors depend crucially on the frequency range concerned .",
    "thus , when we extract the intrinsic spr signals from phc , we should carefully take account of disorder .    from the point of view of the radiation emission from high - energy electron interacting with periodic structure",
    ", we should comment on the peculiarity of the uspr in comparison to the channeling radiation , or in other words , kumakhov radiation @xcite .",
    "the latter radiation occurs inside a crystal when a certain condition is satisfied for the incident angle of the electron with respect to a major crystal direction .",
    "the radiation depends strongly on the meandering trajectory of the electron trapped around a crystal plane or a crystal axis and has a monotonic frequency . on the other hand",
    ", the uspr does not require the meandering of the electron trajectory .",
    "actually , in our theoretical approach , the trajectory of the electron is assumed to be straight .",
    "in addition , the radiation spectrum of the uspr is not monotonic for a fixed trajectory and the typical frequency range is inversely proportional to the lattice constant of the phc under consideration .",
    "therefore , the uspr is not categorized into the channeling radiation .",
    "the uspr is , in some sense , similar to the transition radiation @xcite because the broken translational invariance along the electron trajectory is crucial in both the radiations .",
    "however , there is a marked difference in the directivity between the transition radiation and the uspr .",
    "suppose that an ultra - relativistic electron passes from vacuum to a dielectric medium .",
    "it is better to focus on the radiation into the vacuum side , because the induced radiation in the medium is a mixture of the transition radiation and the cherenkov radiation .",
    "it was shown that this radiation into the vacuum side is backward - oriented . on the other hand ,",
    "as we showed in the paper , such a high directivity into the backward direction is only possible if the relevant frequency lies in a pseudo gap of the phb structure . among other electron - induced radiations ,",
    "the uspr may have the closest resemblance to the diffraction radiation regarding the broken translational invariance and the trajectory which does not pass through any air / dielectric interfaces . to further clarify the resemblance ,",
    "a detailed investigation of the diffraction radiation in phc is in order .",
