    "recent measurements at the cern large hadron collider @xcite constrain a sm - like higgs to be lighter than @xmath0 at 95% confidence level . moreover , both atlas and cms have observed an excess for higgs masses around 125 gev , consistent with each other .",
    "these tantalizing hints for a light higgs boson in the multilepton @xmath1 and , more importantly , in the @xmath2 channels are in excellent agreement with theoretical expectations , which have been coined by electroweak precision measurements performed during the lep era @xcite .",
    "the accumulated statistics of approximately 5 fb@xmath3 per experiment , however , is yet too small to draw a conclusive picture about mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . since the assumption of sm - like production and decay",
    "explicitly enter the hypothesis tests that lead to the formulation of the lhc exclusion limits , the quantitative resemblance of the observed phenomenology with the sm is , in fact , not entirely transparent . instead of mere numerical agreement of data with the sm higgs hypothesis , we can understand the exclusion limits as a measure of how much a more general theory is bound to coincide with the sm in the light of current experimental observations .",
    "this exercise naturally yields model - dependent statements , but there is only a limited number of phenomenological patterns of how the higgs can evade detection  @xcite .",
    "the extension of the higgs sector by including invisible decay modes and constrain them by measurements is crucial for the re - interpretation of the exclusion bounds is this context .",
    "a substantial non - zero branching ratio would signalize a non - standard higgs sector while being in perfect agreement with a non - observation of the higgs at the moment .",
    "constraining invisible branching ratios is a difficult and challenging task at hadron colliders with their busy final states @xcite . a statistically significant determination of an invisible higgs branching ratio requires large statistics ( if possible after all ) as experimental systematics set the scale of uncertainty .",
    "systematics vastly improves when studying the higgs sector at a future linear collider .",
    "there , @xmath4 associated production provides an extremely clean laboratory process to study invisible decays in a model - independent way in recoil analyses @xcite . at the lhc ,",
    "only ratios of branching fractions are accessible in a model - independent fashion , but absolute branching ratio predictions can be formulated in specified models @xcite .",
    "hence , performing such an analysis at a future linear collider is going to be of utmost importance to study the higgs boson in full detail after its discovery at the lhc .     left : masses of the light sm - like higgs boson @xmath5 ( blue ) and the heavy higgs boson @xmath6 ( red ) .",
