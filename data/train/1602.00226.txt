    "to study the inner structures of multiquark states is an interesting subject in hadron physics , because it is obviously beyond the simple @xmath1 or @xmath2 textile which was established by gell - mann more than half century ago .",
    "the molecular structures of the multiquark systems have been studied by many authors , in comparison the tetraquark states have much less been investigated so far . generally , the tetraquark is suggested to be composed of a diquark and an antidiquark which reside in color antitriplet and triplet , respectively  @xcite .",
    "because of the different color structures , the dynamics for molecular states and tetraquark would be very different .",
    "in fact , in molecular states , the two constituents are bound by exchanging color - singlet mesons or baryons which can be described by the chiral lagrangian . instead ,",
    "the two constituents in tetraquarks are bound by direct gluon exchange . as for the quarkonium ,",
    "the interaction between quark and antiquark is realized by exchanging gluons , a single - gluon exchange composes the leading contribution which results in a coulomb - type effective potential , however , for the hadron formation , the energy scale is below @xmath3 , therefore the nonperturbative qcd effects would play an important role which induces a confinement piece in the potential . similarly , for the tetraquark case , the diquark and antidiquark interact by exchanging gluons and definitely the single gluon exchange exists and induce a coulomb - like potential whereas the nonperturbative qcd effects should also be introduced .",
    "it is generally believed that such interaction may be described by the color - flux model  @xcite . following this scenario",
    ", we will study the dynamics which not only results in the different structures of the two configurations , but also determines their different decay patterns . because the newly observed @xmath0 is very likely to be a tetraquark",
    ", it would be an ideal place for carrying research on the teraquark and molecular states via their decay behaviors .",
    "@xmath0 has been observed in the invariant mass spectra of the @xmath4 channel  @xcite , and it is identified as a @xmath5 resonance with mass @xmath6 mev and width @xmath7 mev .",
    "there are many alternative interpretations for the observed peak  @xcite , for example , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite consider that a strong attraction between @xmath8 and @xmath9 bind them together , so that @xmath0 may be interpreted as a baryon - antibaryon molecule . instead , in refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath0 is interpreted as a @xmath10 charmonium state .",
    "also , the @xmath0 is considered to be induced by a threshold effect instead of being a genuine resonance  @xcite .    among those proposals ,",
    "the suggestion that @xmath0 is a tetraquark state is more favorable @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 is identified as the ground state with its orbital angular momentum @xmath11 . by reanalyzing the @xmath12 and @xmath13 spectra , cotugno _",
    "_ suggested that @xmath0 and @xmath14  @xcite could be the same tetraquark state , and is the first radial excitation of the @xmath15 with @xmath11  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors studied the open - charm decay @xmath16 by assuming that @xmath0 is a radially excited state of the diquark - antidiquark bound state with hidden charm . by another theoretical physics group @xcite @xmath0",
    "is interpreted as a molecular state made of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "as is well known , in general the multiquark states may be in tetraquark states which are composed of colored constituents , or in molecular states which are composed of two color singlets , or their mixtures .",
    "therefore , the mechanisms which bind the components in a unique system and induce the multiquark states to decay would be different in those cases . in this work , using the quantum mechanics we analyze the dynamical mechanisms inducing decays of the tetraquarks and the molecular states , where @xmath0 stands as an example for the study .",
    "thus , a numerical analysis on the decay width of channel @xmath19 based on the tetraquark postulate is made and a qualitative discussion about the possible decay process @xmath20 where @xmath0 may be a mixture of tetraquark and molecular state is presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after this introduction , we study the decay of @xmath0 with the tetraquark and molecular interpretations in secs  [ sec : tetra ] and  [ sec : mole ] respectively , then sec  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to our discussion and conclusion .",
    "inspired by the fact that the @xmath0 decays into charmed baryon pair , one is tempted to conjecture this resonance as a tetraquark which is made of the diquark - antidiquark @xmath21[\\bar c\\bar q]$ ] , where @xmath22 is a light quark either @xmath23 or @xmath24 , @xmath21 $ ] resides in a color antitriplet whereas @xmath25 $ ] is in a color triplet .    here",
    "we take the diquark - antidiquark picture proposed by brodsky _",
    "_ @xcite that a diquark and an antidiquark are bound together by a gluon - flux - tube into a color singlet tetraquark where the constituents are separated by a substantial distance once they are created .",
    "the interaction for the system can be well described by a generalized cornell potential  @xcite since the constituents ( diquark and antidiquark ) are treated as two pointlike color sources in analog to the configuration for an ordinary @xmath26 quarkonium .    in terms of the quark pair creation ( qpc ) model where a quark - antiquark pair is excited out from vacuum , we calculated the decay width of @xmath27  @xcite . in that picture , the qcd vacuum is excited and a quark - antiquark pair is created . the quark - antiquark pair would  tear \" apart the diquark and antidiquark due to strong qcd interaction between quark and diquark ( antiquark and antidiquark ) . then joining the diquark ,",
    "the created quark becomes a constituent of the charmed baryon @xmath8 , and as well for the @xmath9 .    in parallel ,",
    "let us consider an alternative way to discuss the production of @xmath12 in the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , the color flux - tube results in a potential barrier to forbid the inner constituents ( either the diquark or the antidiquark ) to escape from the bound state . in terms of a modified flux - tube - induced potential ,",
    "the decay of @xmath0 may occur as the diquark - antidiquark bound system falling apart via tunneling through the effective potential barrier .",
    "after tunneling out the barrier , the diquark ( antidiquark ) would immediately attract a quark ( antiquark ) from the vacuum to compose a color singlet @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and the hadronization process is somehow similar to the picture frequently used to study the multiparticle production at high energy collision . then the transition probability can be calculated in terms of the wkb ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin ) approximation .",
    "first , we employ a nonrelativistic potential model with a cornell - like potential where some free parameters are obtained by fitting the mass spectrum of heavy quarkonia and generalized to the case for tetraquark , then we get the wave function of @xmath0 by solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "the general hamiltonian of a diquark - antidiquark system ( i.e. a quarkonium - like system ) can be written as @xmath28 where the @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the masses(3-momenta ) of the diquark @xmath31 and antidiquark @xmath32 respectively , we take @xmath33 in this work .",

    "indeed , even though the calculated decay width of @xmath19 is smaller than the central value of the measured total width , one still can not conclude that @xmath0 is not a pure tetraquark yet .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the tetraquark picture is able to predict the correct decay width of @xmath0 , even though not completely confident , we believe that its decay mechanism could be considered as the diquark - antidiquark system falling apart via tunneling through an effective potential barrier , and then diquark and antidiquark are respectively hadronized into color singlet hadrons , and the @xmath12 pair should be the main product .",

    "@xcite , in which a similar result is obtained within the qpc framework .",
    "it is noteworthy that if the future measurement indeed confirms a rather large total width which is larger than our prediction based on the pure tetraquark structure , a possible mixture between tetraquark and molecular state should be taken into account and other decay modes such as @xmath20 may occur with non - negligible fraction .",
    "as is mentioned in the introduction and the above discussion , the hadronic molecular picture @xmath85 is another possible choice for the inner structure of @xmath0 which was proposed by guo _",
    "et al . _",
    "it is noted that the mass and width of @xmath0 are consistent with those for the @xmath14 state ( @xmath86 mev , @xmath87 mev  @xcite ) within error tolerance . by taking into account the @xmath88 final state interaction ,",
    "it is found that the @xmath0 may be the same state as @xmath89 , and the resonance can be a @xmath85 molecular bound state .     and @xmath18 of @xmath0 residing in the attractive potential well which is supposed to be a hadronic molecular state .",
    "the effective potential is induced by the @xmath48 meson exchange , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details.,width=283 ]    now let us study the mechanism which may induce the decay of the molecular state . because the two constituents in the molecular state are color singlets",
    ", they do not interact by directly exchanging gluons , but only via exchanging color - singlet mesons , and the leading contribution is coming from the @xmath90 exchange between @xmath17 and @xmath18 which does not induce a potential barrier as for the tetraquark case .",
    "instead , the interaction provides a potential well and the constituents are confined in the well , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : well ] . thus we should have @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the binding energy of the molecular state and roughly is @xmath93 mev . in the traditional framework of quantum mechanics",
    "it is a stable structure , i.e. @xmath0 can not dissolve into on - shell @xmath17 and @xmath18 , however , due to the quantum fluctuation , @xmath18 can jump out the potential well to become an off - shell virtual particle . if the virtual @xmath18 does not transit into two real pions , it would fall back to its original state inside the molecule .",
    "the duration of it being virtual particle can be estimated by the uncertainty principle as @xmath94 in the natural unit system , thus the virtuality time @xmath95 is proportional to @xmath96 where @xmath92 is the binding energy .",
    "obviously the decay amplitude should be proportional to @xmath95 , namely the larger the binding energy @xmath97 is , the shorter @xmath98 is , and then the smaller the decay probability would be . by this principle , we can write out an effective lagrangian which induces the decay of the molecule @xmath99 where the superscript @xmath100 denotes that @xmath18 is an off - shell virtual meson which later transits into two pions .",
    "the effective vertex at @xmath101 is @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 correspond to @xmath105 , @xmath18 and @xmath106 is a dimensionless universal coupling constant . by the equation of motion",
    "it is easy to be reduced into @xmath107 which reads as @xmath108 the effective coupling given by authors of ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the reduced mass of the @xmath111 and @xmath18 , @xmath112 has an energy dimension .",
    "thus we can identify the relation @xmath113    with this assumption another decay mode of @xmath0 could be @xmath114 for the off - shell @xmath18 mainly decaying into @xmath115 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ otherdecay ] .    with the given lagrangian ,",
    "the decay width was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath116 mev , here we do not repeat it and advise readers to refer to that paper .",
    "the hadronic decay is closely associated with the nonperturbative qcd , and a lot of phenomenological models are proposed to account for its effects .",
    "for example , the qpc model , flux - tube model , qcd sum rules and lattice qcd , etc . have been successfully used to estimate decay rates , even though , with the exception of the lattice calculation , none of them can be directly derived from quantum field theory so far .    for the @xmath26 systems ,",
    "the physics picture is clear , even though a phenomenological model must be embedded to reflect the nonperturbative qcd effects and the computation schemes are mature . however , for the four - quark states , the inner structure and dynamics which leads the binding and decay of the state are still not well understood and there are various proposals for them . in this work we study the decay mechanisms of @xmath0 in both tetraquark and molecule pictures in the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "namely , we use the wkb approximation to calculate the decay width of @xmath0 as it is assumed to be a tetraquark state , and then qualitatively discuss its decay mechanism as it is postulated as a molecular state where @xmath18 jumps out the potential well due to a quantum fluctuation and becomes a virtual particle and later transits into two real pions .",
    "definitely , all of the assignments to the observed resonance at 4630 mev should be tested in the future by more precise measurements . in our other works",
    "@xcite , we study the case that if @xmath0 is a tetraquark , its favorable decay mode should be @xmath82 which would overwhelmingly dominate its width , but due to the inelastic rescattering processes between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , some other final states , such as @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 might be produced with measurable rates , whereas , if @xmath0 is a molecular state , its dominant decay mode would be @xmath121 and due to the decay of @xmath17 and final state interaction , the pattern of the decay products which will be experimentally measured would be completely different from the tetraquark case . thus the measurements would provide more information about the assignment of @xmath0 .",
