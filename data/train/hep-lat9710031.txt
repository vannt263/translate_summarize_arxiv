    "as a step toward the clarification of the finite - temperature qcd transition , it is important to investigate the nature of the transition on the lattice with two degenerate light quarks . in a previous study@xcite , using the wilson quark action and a renormalization group ( rg ) improved gauge action @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite , we studied the nature of the phase transition and the scaling behavior of the chiral condensate at @xmath3 @xmath4 on an @xmath5 lattice , where @xmath6 is the value of @xmath7 at the chiral transition point . in the present work ,",
    "we extend the study to @xmath8 performing simulations at @xmath9 , 1.2 , and 1.35 on an @xmath10 lattice .",
    "we also determine the phase structure of the chiral limit , in particular , for @xmath8 at @xmath5 on a @xmath11 plane .",
    "= 6.2 cm    fig.[fig : dig ] shows our result for the phase diagram on a @xmath11 plane . in the previous work@xcite ,",
    "the line of the zero - temperature chiral limit @xmath12 defined by the vanishing point of the pion mass was determined on an @xmath13 lattice , and the finite - temperature transition / crossover line @xmath14 for @xmath5 was determined on an @xmath15 lattice .",
    "the @xmath14 line crosses the @xmath12 line at @xmath16 .",
    "= 5.8 cm    in this work , we estimate the location of the finite - temperature chiral limit @xmath17 for @xmath5 , defined by the vanishing point of the pion screening mass @xmath18 . in fig.[fig : mass ] , we plot @xmath19 and the quark mass @xmath20 for @xmath5 at fixed @xmath7 as a function of @xmath21 , where @xmath20 is defined by an axial ward identity@xcite . in the upper figure for @xmath22 , there are two chiral limits . on the other hand , at @xmath23 in the lower figure , we can not find a clear gap between the two chiral limits .",
    "these results imply that the line @xmath17 for the chiral limit turns back towards strong coupling around @xmath6 , forming a cusp , as shown in fig.[fig : dig ] .",
    "this structure is consistent with that expected from the parity - flavor breaking scenario@xcite , which was confirmed for the standard one plaquette gauge action and the wilson quark action@xcite .",
    "= 6.0 cm    the magnetization @xmath24 near the second order transition is expected to be described by a single scaling function ; @xmath25 with @xmath26 the external magnetic field and @xmath27/t_c(h\\!=\\!0)$ ] the reduced temperature .",
    "according to the universality argument , when the chiral transition is of second order , two flavor qcd belongs to the same universality class as the three dimensional o(4 ) spin model@xcite , and the chiral condensate should satisfy the scaling relation ( [ eq : universality ] ) with the o(4 ) exponents and the o(4 ) scaling function .",
    "we identify @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , where @xmath24 is a subtracted chiral condensate defined through an axial ward identity@xcite , @xmath31 our results for @xmath32 are shown in fig.[fig : psi ] .",
    "we make a fit to the scaling function of the o(4 ) model by adjusting @xmath6 and the scales for @xmath33 and @xmath26 , with the exponents fixed to the o(4 ) values@xcite , including all the data in the range @xmath34 and @xmath35 shown in fig.[fig : psi ] .",
    "we note that the data for the lightest quark mass ( @xmath36 - 0.07 ) at @xmath37 , 1.2 , and 1.35 are slightly off the scaling curve .",
    "therefore , we make a fit excluding these three points .",
    "the result of the fit with @xmath38 is shown in fig.[fig : scaling](a ) .",
    "the result shows that scaling works well in the @xmath39 region as well as the @xmath40 region , except the three lightest quark mass data at @xmath41 , indicated by the filled symbols .",
    "the adjusted @xmath42 is consistent with @xmath43 obtained by the previous fit using only the @xmath44 data@xcite .",
    "one possible origin of the deviation from the scaling curve of the lightest quark mass data at @xmath39 is a finite size effect , because , in the confining phase , we expect that finite size effects are severe at small quark mass . to explore this possibility , we are performing simulations on @xmath45 ( @xmath46 and 16 ) lattices for the lightest quark mass data at @xmath47 and 1.35 .",
    "the statistics we have accumulated so far ( about 50 configurations each ) is not yet high enough to obtain a definite conclusion about the systematic size dependence of the deviation from the scaling curve .",
    "another possible origin for the deviation is the explicit chiral breaking due to the wilson term , which is expected to be large at small @xmath7 .",
    "it is plausible that this effect becomes visible as deviation from scaling , when the explicit chiral violation due to the wilson term becomes larger than that from the quark mass .",
    "the fact that we observe the deviation from the scaling at the lightest quarks mass for small @xmath7 region is consistent with this interpretation . to confirm this interpretation",
    "it is necessary to make a simulation at larger @xmath48 to reach a larger @xmath7 region , or use an improved quark action .",
    "we also study the possibility of the mf scaling@xcite .",
    "we perform the scaling test using mf exponents and the mf scaling function . because @xmath18 at @xmath7=1.5 does not vanish in the chiral limit ( cf .",
    "fig.3 in ref.@xcite ) , we restrict @xmath49 . we then obtain the best fit shown in fig.[fig : scaling](b ) with @xmath50 , to be compared with @xmath51 obtained for the o(4 ) case [ fig.[fig : scaling](a ) ] .",
    "we exclude the mf scaling , as the data is much more scattered than in the o(4 ) case .",
    "the success of the scaling with the o(4 ) exponents , albeit with the three lightest quark data at @xmath52 excluded , indicates that the chiral transition for two flavor qcd is of second order in the continuum limit .",
    "numerical simulations are performed with fujitsu vpp500/30 at the university of tsukuba .",
