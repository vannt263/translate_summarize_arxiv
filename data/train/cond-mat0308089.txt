    "the conjecture that the statistical properties of energy levels of chaotic quantum systems may be described in terms of the theory of random matrices is widely accepted in various fields of physics .",
    "@xcite this however is not a universal property of all complex interacting systems .",
    "one example to the contrary is provided by the class of the so - called integrable models , @xcite where the behavior of the system is completely described by a large ( infinite in the thermodynamic limit ) set of conserved quantities .",
    "one consequence is that the level - spacing distribution @xmath0 in the case of integrable models is the poisson distribution ( @xmath1 denotes mean level spacing ) ,    @xmath2    whereas in random - matrix theory the distribution takes the wigner - dyson form ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 correspond to orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ensembles respectively and @xcite @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "other statistical properties ( for example , the evolution of levels under an external perturbation @xcite ) also differ for the two cases . one important class of external perturbations is the application of a voltage .",
    "the difference in response in this case leads to spectacular differences in transport properties of integrable and non - integrable models .",
    "integrable models have been argued to have an infinite conductivity even at high temperatures , essentially because a typical level has a large response to a voltage , whereas non - integrable models have a finite conductivity because a typical level has a small response .",
    "@xcite    while these basic properties have been established for the two generic cases of integrable and non - integrable models , the crossover between these two limits as an integrability - breaking interaction is turned on has not to our knowledge been carefully studied , nor have the implications of the crossover for the finite - size conductivity of nearly integrable systems been determined .",
    "two of us , with n. andrei , presented a few numerical results in a paper mainly concerned with the charge transport of integrable systems .",
    "@xcite however , the significance and interpretation of these results was not clear .",
    "song and shepelyansky @xcite studied the effects of a random potential on level statistics of 2d interacting fermions and found evidence for a localization - delocalization transition .",
    "however , in their case , the physics of the transition is due to the disorder and thus is different from the situation in integrable models .",
    "earlier work by distasio and zotos @xcite noted a crossover between poisson to wigner - dyson only for the low - energy part of the spectrum and did not address scaling with system size .    in this paper",
    "we will fill these gaps by providing numerical results for finite - size chains with hamiltonian given by the ( integrable ) xxz model plus an integrability - breaking perturbation @xmath11 .",
    "our principal results are computations , for finite - length chains , of the crossover from behavior characteristic of poisson to behavior characteristic of wigner - dyson statistics in various statistical measures .",
    "these crossovers do not display an obvious universality in the sense that different measures show different behavior depending on the xxz asymmetry parameter and system size .",
    "our computations are performed for finite - size systems .",
    "an important issue is the behavior in the limit of thermodynamically large system .",
    "extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit proves to be ambiguous for most of the measures we employ ( namely , we can not rule out a saturation of the crossover scales as functions of the system size for chains much longer than those considered in this study ) , but the data suggest that all the crossover scales vanish at infinite system size .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we discuss the model used in numerical calculations and in particular define numerically the value of the integrability - breaking parameter at which a gap appears in the spectrum .",
    "all further considerations will be devoted to the gapless regime .",
    "then we discuss the level - spacing distribution and the correlator of level velocities .",
    "the latter is related to the parametric statistics of the system and also to its transport properties . for disordered systems ,",
    "the correlator of level velocities was shown to correspond to the dimensionless conductance of the system , while if one restricts the analysis to periodic boundary conditions only ( see below ) it coincides with the drude weight .",
    "discussion of the drude weight concludes the paper .",
    "we study the effect of integrability breaking on the physical properties of a spin chain .",
    "the integrable model we consider is the xxz chain defined on a @xmath12-site ring with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of external flux @xmath13 threading the ring :    @xmath14    ( alternatively , the flux can be gauged out to the boundary , resulting in twisted boundary conditions . )",
    "as is well - known , statistical properties of integrable models are governed by the poisson distribution , eq.([poisson ] ) .",
    "transport properties of the model can also be inferred from studying the energy levels of the model , namely by their response to the flux @xmath13 . at zero temperature",
    "the behavior of the ground - state energy of the system under slow variations of the flux determines the drude weight or the stiffness @xcite @xmath15 as    @xmath16    non - vanishing @xmath15 signals ballistic transport in the system . for the xxz model at @xmath17",
    "this is the case @xcite for @xmath18 , where excitations of the system are gapless . if @xmath19 , then the excitation spectrum of the model is gapped,@xcite and @xmath20 . at finite temperatures the above expression for the stiffness",
    "can be generalized @xcite to @xmath21 , where    @xmath22    vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , @xcite and the rest is _ positive _ :    @xmath23    in the gapless phase of the xxz model it has been shown @xcite that ballistic transport persists to finite temperatures in the sense that @xmath24 .",
    "the infinite - temperature limit of this result implies that for a typical level @xmath25 . at the antiferromagnetic heisenberg point",
    "@xmath26 the model still has gapless excitations , but results of fabricius and mccoy @xcite suggest that @xmath27 vanishes ( slowly ) as the system size increases .",
    "numerical results of narozhny _ _ et al.__@xcite were consistent with this suggestion , but the limited range of system sizes attainable precluded a definite statement .",
    "integrability breaking is introduced by adding the term with next - neighbor coupling    @xmath28    this term should be contrasted to that considered by eggert @xcite insofar as it is explicitly not su(2 ) invariant .",
    "however , away from the heisenberg point the effect of the interaction eq .",
    "( [ j2 ] ) is similar to that of its su(2)-invariant counterpart : ( i ) it breaks the integrability of the system , and ( ii ) for large enough values of @xmath29 it causes the system to dimerize , so that the spectrum acquires a gap .",
    "the critical value of @xmath29 at which the gap opens is of course different from the @xmath30 found in ref .  .",
    "our numerical estimates @xcite suggest a value @xmath31 that is a weakly increasing function of both system size and @xmath32 : for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , for example , the gap appears to open at @xmath35 .",
    "the gap opening limits the range of values of @xmath29 under consideration , as we are interested only in properties of the gapless phase ; indeed , the measures we consider presently begin showing different behavior for @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , the parameter region considered by faas _ _ et al.__@xcite belongs to the gapped regime , which accounts for certain differences in the behavior of the level statistics reported in ref .   and in the present paper .",
    "in this paper we study the eigenvalues of @xmath37 and their evolution under the change of @xmath13 for the above models with varying @xmath38 and system size . for the non - integrable hamiltonian @xmath39 we use exact numerical diagonalization to construct the level - spacing distribution and level auto - correlation functions and to evaluate the stiffness @xmath27 , eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) . the use of exact numerical methods is motivated by the need to obtain the whole spectrum of the model in order ( i ) to study the statistical properties of the spectrum and ( ii ) to study the stiffness eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) at infinite temperature .",
    "the drawback of the method is the limitation to small system sizes ( we present results for chains of up to @xmath40 sites ) . for finite",
    "system sizes we obtain a detailed characterization of the crossover .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of the integrable case .",
    "the level - spacing distribution for @xmath41 is the poisson distribution ( shown in fig.[pe ] by the left solid curve ) .",

    "@xmath44 is seen to be almost size - independent for the cases @xmath45 , in agreement with previous work , @xcite while a weak size dependence is evident in the heisenberg case @xmath26 .",
    "although this dependence appears to have a positive @xmath46-intercept , we believe that the system size in this study is still too small to make a definite statement regarding the behavior of the heisenberg model in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite    = 7 cm    we turn now to the case of broken integrability . as the integrability - breaking term eq .",
    "( [ j2 ] ) is added to the hamiltonian , energy levels immediately start to repel,@xcite and as a consequence immediately @xmath47 so that the distribution acquires a peak . as illustrated in fig .",

    "the tail of the distribution changes from the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) to the ( asymptotically ) gaussian tail of the wigner - dyson distribution .    to quantify this crossover",
    "we show the evolution of the peak position and the characteristics of the tail with the change in @xmath29 in figs .",
    "[ peak ] and [ tail ] .",

    "the inset shows the resulting values for @xmath48 as a function of the system size . as we noted before ,",
    "@xcite we are restricting our attention to fixed values of the total spin @xmath51 .",
    "however , for the purposes of the finite - size scaling , it makes more sense to compare data with the fixed ratio @xmath52 .",
    "one way to see this is to recall that by means of the jordan - wigner transformation the spin chain can be mapped onto a system of spinless fermions.@xcite in the fermion language , @xmath53 corresponds to the filling fraction . since it is not possible to keep the ratio @xmath52 exactly the same for all values of @xmath12 used in this paper , we choose to present the data for two sectors of fixed @xmath51 that are closest to the chosen value of @xmath52 .",

    "( [ j2 ] ) on the stiffness @xmath27 . in fig .  [ figd2 ]",
    "we show three sets of data corresponding to three different values of the xxz anisotropy parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the data illustrate the following tendencies :    \\(i ) for @xmath84 ( represented by @xmath34 ; similar behavior is observed for other values ) the data clearly show that very small integrability breaking ( characterized by @xmath85 ) has little effect on the stiffness of the finite chains ( which is to be expected )",
    ". moreover , the extrapolation to infinite size seems to result in a finite value for the stiffness in a manner similar to that of the integrable model .",
    "\\(ii ) for the heisenberg model , small integrability breaking again does not have a pronounced effect ; however , in this case ( even though the extrapolation indicates a finite value for the thermodynamic limit ) , one can not be certain of the behavior of the infinite chain .",

    "the extrapolation to infinite size is also uncertain .",
    "it should be noted , however , that if one compares the behavior of two integrable cases , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , then a similar picture arises ( compare for example the two top dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ figd2 ] ) .",
    "this has to do with the fact that the spin chain at @xmath86 can be mapped ( by means of the jordan - wigner transformation ) onto a system of free spinless fermions and as such possesses more symmetries than even the integrable ( but interacting ) xxz model .",
    "\\(iv ) when the integrability - breaking parameter is not small , the stiffness decays sharply ( in fact , if we were to show a log - log plot , faster than any power law ) with system size and clearly extrapolates to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively independent of @xmath32 .",

    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",

    "@xmath29 is rather weak , and the curve exhibits a clear crossover . for @xmath86",
    "the crossover also appears ; however , the value @xmath88 to which the curve tends as @xmath89 is much smaller than the value at @xmath41 exactly ( which is @xmath90 and is thus outside the frame of the plot ) .",
    "the crossover is illustrated in the left inset .",
    "the right inset shows the change of the crossover scale with system size for @xmath86 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the behavior at @xmath26 is quite different and in particular does not show an obvious crossover ( and is thus not represented in the right inset ) .",
    "this behavior might be related to the conjecture @xcite that at the heisenberg point the stiffness vanishes in the thermodynamic limit even without the integrability breaking .",
    "alternatively , this can reflect the fact that the heisenberg model is characterized by logarithmic correlations,@xcite and thus the small systems considered in this paper are not representative .",
    "prior to performing the calculations one could have had two conflicting expectations for the behavior of the non - integrable system : ( i ) as soon as the integrability is broken the system becomes chaotic and as a result shows diffusive transport ; ( ii ) there exists a `` critical '' magnitude of the integrability breaking that separates the chaotic regime from the one that retains some features of the integrable model , in particular , ballistic transport .",
    "the latter picture has an analogy in the localization problem in disordered conductors .",
    "@xcite the states of an integrable model can be visualized as well - defined localized points in the multidimensional space of the integrals of motion characteristic of the model .",
    "these points are well separated due to the quantization of the values of the integrals of motion .",
    "consider now the effect of an infinitesimally small integrability breaking .",
    "one can certainly expect the points to spread out into fuzzy spots , but at the same time one might argue that unless the integrability breaking is strong enough , these spots do not overlap . in this regime",
    "the system retains some memory of the fact that it was indeed integrable before the extra interaction was turned on .",
    "when the integrability breaking is so strong that the spots overlap into a continuum , the system becomes fully chaotic .",
    "the numerical analysis presented in this paper seems roughly consistent with the second possibility for finite chains : a small integrability - breaking term leads to behavior that is close to that of the integrable system .",
    "quantities related to transport , the stiffness @xmath27 and the conductance , @xmath77 , exhibit a reasonably rapid crossover as functions of the strength of the integrability - breaking interaction .",
    "the crossover behaviors seem to be different for different quantities .",
    "table  [ jtab ] , for example , illustrates some of this variability for the example of @xmath34 , intermediate between the non - interacting model and the heisenberg point .",
