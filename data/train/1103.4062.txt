    "chiral effective field theory ( cheft ) provides a systematic and model - independent framework to analyze hadron structure and dynamics in harmony with the spontaneously broken approximate chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "this approach is a powerful tool for the derivation of the nuclear forces .",
    "exchange vector and axial currents in nuclei have also been studied in the framework of cheft . since the pioneering work of park et al .",
    "@xcite , heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory has been applied to derive exchange axial and vector currents for small values of the photon momentum .",
    "these calculations have been carried out in time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "the resulting exchange vector currents have been , in particular , applied to analyze radiative neutron - proton capture within a hybrid approach  @xcite .",
    "cheft has also been used to study the electromagnetic properties of the deuteron  @xcite and @xmath1he  @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental processes observed for the deuteron is the photodisintegration reaction .",
    "it has been a subject of intense experimental and theoretical research for several decades ( see refs  @xcite ) .",
    "also photodisintegration of @xmath1he has been studied experimentally and theoretically for a long time  @xcite .",
    "photodisintegration observables provide a good tool for studying the contributions from meson exchange currents ( mec ) to the nuclear current operator .",
    "this is because the charge density operator , which often dominates low - energy electrodisintegration and is mostly given by the single nucleon current , does not play any role in this reaction .",
    "an ongoing interest in low - energy photodisintegration reactions , especially in view of planned experiments , provides a strong motivation to apply the framework of chiral effective field theory .",
    "this approach relies on the approximate spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "it allows for a systematic derivation of the nuclear hamiltonian and the corresponding electromagnetic current operator from the underlying effective lagrangian for pions and nucleons via the chiral expansion , i.e. a simultaneous expansion in soft momenta of external particles and about the chiral limit . for more details on the application of cheft to nuclear forces and currents",
    "the reader is referred to recent review articles @xcite and references therein .    in the two- and three - nucleon systems , the leading contributions to the exchange current originate from one - pion exchange which are well known .",
    "the 2n current operator at the leading loop order in the chiral expansion has been worked out by pastore et al .",
    "@xcite based on time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "independently , the two - pion exchange 2n current operator has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite using the method of unitary transformation .",
    "the resulting current operator is consistent with the corresponding chiral two - nucleon potential  @xcite obtained within the same scheme . in the present work ,",
    "for the first time we explore the effects of the leading two - pion exchange 2n operator  @xcite in the photodisintegration reactions of @xmath0h and @xmath1he .",
    "we , however , emphasize that the presented calculations are not yet complete . in particular , the corresponding expressions for the one - pion exchange at nlo and short - range contributions to the current operator within the method of unitary transformation are not yet available .",
    "our main goal in the present work is to explore the sensitivity of various observables in the deuteron and @xmath1he photodisintegration to the two - pion exchange current rather than to provide a complete description of these reactions within the cheft framework .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the formalism which we use to describe selected 2n electromagnetic reactions is presented .",
    "the results for the photodisintegration of the @xmath0h are discussed and compared with the experimental data in section iii .",
    "the extension to the 3n system is briefly described in section iv and the results obtained for photodisintegration of @xmath1he are presented in section v. finally , section vi contains the summary and conclusions .",
    "the general form of the nuclear matrix element for electromagnetic disintegration reactions in the 2n system is represented by @xmath2 where the proton - neutron scattering state @xmath3 and the deuteron bound state @xmath4 are obtained using nn potential .",
    "the current operator @xmath5 acts between the internal initial and final 2n states .",
    "we employ the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation , @xmath6 , in order to express @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the free 2n propagator , @xmath10 is the nn t - matrix and @xmath11 is the eigenstate of the relative proton - neutron momentum .",
    "since all observables can be computed from @xmath7 , the description of the electromagnetic reactions requires the knowledge of the consistent potential and electromagnetic current .",
    "the nn potential based on cheft is currently available up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order in the chiral expansion  @xcite .",
    "as already pointed out , in this paper we focus on the long - range tpe contributions to the current operator , which appear at nlo .",
    "however , in order to avoid the theoretical error from using the less accurate nlo nn potential , all calculations are made using the n@xmath0lo potential . at this order ,",
    "the nn potential @xmath12 is built from the one - pion exchange ( ope ) , @xmath13 , and two - pion exchange ( tpe ) , @xmath14 , contributions as well as various contact interactions ( @xmath15 )  @xcite @xmath16 the effective current operator @xmath17 for the 2n system is a sum of the single - nucleon operators @xmath18 and two - nucleon operators of different type ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 the expressions for the single - nucleon and the leading ope currents @xmath22 are well established , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the results for the leading two - pion exchange contributions used in the present work are available in refs .",
    "we emphasize that the resulting two - pion exchange current is parameter - free .",
    "the expressions for the ope and contact currents at the leading loop level have been recently worked out within time - ordered perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "work on the derivation of these contributions using the method of unitary transformation is still in progress .",
    "the 2n four - current operator @xmath23 can be decomposed according to its isospin and spin - momentum structure and quite generally written in the form  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the momentum transferred to nucleon @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the 2n isospin operator , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the ( momentum dependent ) spin operators in the 2n space , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are scalar functions .",
    "the explicit form of the scalar functions and the operator basis for @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on a treatment of the long - range tpe contributions to the 2n current operator derived in ref .",
    "the expressions for the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 entering the tpe current and charge density operators in eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq2a ] ) are rather complicated and contain the standard loop functions and the three - point functions in a form suitable for numerical calculations  @xcite . due to their isospin structure ,",
    "not all combinations of ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq2a ] ) contribute to photodisintegration of the deuteron .",
    "the non - vanishing contributions emerge from @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the third cartesian component of the vector .",
    "we work in momentum space and apply the standard partial wave decomposition of the 2n potential , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "our calculations are performed using a complete set of 2n states @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the magnitude of the relative momentum , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the orbital angular momentum , spin , total angular momentum and its projection on the quantisation axis @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the isospin quantum numbers of the two - nucleon system are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath45 .",
    "the tpe current operator needs to be expressed in the same partial wave basis . to this end",
    ", we first prepare all spin and isospin matrix elements using @xmath46 and then calculate the resulting four - fold angular integrals @xmath47 numerically . here ,",
    "@xmath48 denote the clebsch - gordon coefficient and @xmath49 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "such an approach has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to calculate the four - fold integrals in eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) for the whole grids of @xmath39 and @xmath50 points and all non - vanishing @xmath51 combinations we used the parallel supercomputer ibm blue gene / p of the jlich supercomputing centre ( jsc ) .",
    "we now discuss the results for the deuteron photodisintegration process for the unpolarized cross section and selected polarization observables .",
    "the results for the differential cross section , the photon analyzing power and outgoing proton polarization at the photon laboratory energies of @xmath52 = 10 , 30 and 60 mev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     it remains to be seen whether the inclusion of the missing meson exchange current contributions will allow to reduce the theoretical uncertainty for the cross section .",
    "in this work we explored the effects of the tpe currents derived recently in the framework of cheft  @xcite in the deuteron and @xmath1he photodisintegration reactions .",
    "we studied the role of various ingredients of the chiral 2n current operator in the unpolarized cross section and several polarization observables .",
    "as a main outcome of our study , we found that the new terms in the exchange current operator beyond the well - known one - pion exchange contribution play an important role for nearly all considered reactions . in particular , the differential cross section and the photon analyzing power in the deuteron photodisintegration process and the spin observables in @xmath1he two - body photodisintegration are found to provide excellent testing ground for probing the fine details of the exchange current operator .",
    "we also found that the inclusion of the tpe contribution to the current operator alone typically results in very broad bands for the considered observables .",
    "this behavior is not unexpected .",
    "the ope and tpe mec are computed in the framework of chiral eft within the low - momentum expansion and thus feature singular behavior at short distances ( or large momenta ) .",
    "this leads to the observed large sensitivity of the calculated nuclear matrix elements to the short - distance behavior of the corresponding wave functions which is strongly scheme and cut - off dependent . in a _",
    "complete _ calculation , the cut - off dependence of the low - energy observables is expected to be strongly reduced by the `` running '' of the corresponding short - range current operators , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for the explicit examples of such a behavior in the case of the m1 properties of light nuclei within the hybrid approach and ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive discussion on the ( meaning of ) renormalization in the context of nuclear eft with a finite cut - off .",
    "thus , the strong cut - off dependence in the obtained incomplete results which do not include the short - range contributions to the current operator should not be surprising .",
    "we expect that a complete nlo calculation including the short - range contact and the subleading ope contributions to the 2n current operator will yield much narrower bands allowing for a quantitative description of electromagnetic reactions in a wider kinematical range .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
