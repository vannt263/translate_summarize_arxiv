    "immiscible two - phase flow in the vicinity of the contact line ( cl ) , where the fluid - fluid interface intersects the solid wall , is a classical problem that falls beyond the framework of conventional hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "in particular , molecular dynamics ( md ) studies have shown relative slipping between the fluids and the wall , in violation of the no - slip boundary condition @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous ad - hoc models @xcite to address this phenomenon , but none was able to give a quantitative account of the md slip velocity profile in the molecular - scale vicinity of the cl .",
    "while away from the moving cl the small amount of relative slipping was found to follow the navier boundary condition ( nbc ) @xcite , i.e. , relative slipping proportional to the tangential viscous stress , in the molecular - scale vicinity of the cl the nbc failed totally to account for the near - complete slip .",
    "this failure casts doubts on the general applicability of the nbc to immiscible flows and hinders a continuum formulation of the hydrodynamics in the cl region .",
    "in particular , a ( possible ) breakdown in the hydrodynamic description for the molecular - scale cl region has been suggested @xcite . in another approach @xcite",
    ", it was shown the md results can be reproduced by continuum finite element simulations , provided the slip profile extracted from md is used as input .",
    "this work demonstrated the feasibility of the hybrid algorithm , but left unresolved the problem concerning the boundary condition governing the cl motion . without a continuum",
    "hydrodynamic formulation , it becomes difficult or impossible to have realistic simulations of micro- or nanofluidics , or of immiscible flows in porous media where the relative wetting characteristics , the moving cl dissipation , and behavior over undulating solid surfaces may have macroscopic implications .    from md simulations on immiscible two - phase flows , we report the finding that the generalized navier boundary condition ( gnbc ) applies for all boundary regions , whereby the relative slipping is proportional to the sum of tangential viscous stress and the uncompensated young stress .",
    "the latter arises from the deviation of the fluid - fluid interface from its static configuration @xcite . by combining gnbc with the cahn - hilliard ( ch ) hydrodynamic formulation of two - phase flow @xcite",
    ", we obtained a consistent , continuum description of immiscible flow with material parameters ( such as viscosity , interfacial tension , etc ) directly obtainable from md simulations .",
    "the convective - diffusive dynamics in the vicinity of the interface and the moving cl also means the introduction of two phenomenological dynamic parameters whose values can be fixed by comparison with one md flow profile .",
    "once the parameter values are determined from md simulations , our continuum hydrodynamics can yield predictions matching those from md simulations ( for different couette and poiseuille flows ) .",
    "our findings suggest the no - slip boundary condition to be an approximation to the gnbc , accurate for most macroscopic flows but failing in immiscible flows .",
    "these results open the door to efficient simulations of nano- or microfluidics involving immiscible components , as well as to macroscopic immiscible flow calculations , e.g. , in porous media , that are physically meaningful at the molecular level @xcite .",
    "the latter is possible , for example , by employing the adaptive method based on the iterative grid redistribution introduced in ref .",
    "this method has demonstrated the capability of resolving , at the same time , both the global behavior of a partial differential equation solution with coarse mesh , and a strong singularity in a localized region with a refined local mesh of over @xmath0 ratio to the coarse mesh .",
    "the md simulations were performed for both the static and dynamic configurations in couette and poiseuille flows .",

    "each of the two walls was constructed by two ( or more ) [ 001 ] planes of an fcc lattice ( see appendix [ app - wall - fluid ] ) , with each wall molecule attached to the lattice site by a harmonic spring .",
    "the mean - squared displacement of wall molecules was controlled to obey the lindemann criterion .",

    "periodic boundary conditions were imposed on the @xmath23 and @xmath24 boundaries of the sample .",

    "the resulting static interface is a circular arc with a @xmath32 contact angle .",
    "we measured six quantities in the couette - flow steady states of @xmath33 , @xmath27 for the symmetric case and @xmath34 , @xmath27 for the asymmetric case : @xmath35 , the slip velocity relative to the moving wall ; @xmath36 , the tangential force per unit area exerted by the wall ; the @xmath37 , @xmath38 components of the fluid stress tensor ( @xmath39 denotes the outward surface normal ) , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",

    "thus if @xmath63 is the total stress , we will be concerned only with the hydrodynamic part , denoted by @xmath64 .",
    "we note that in the absence of body forces , force equilibrium in bulk fluid is governed by the relation @xmath65 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , this relation is altered in the bl , where the fluid - wall interaction means the existence of a dynamic , tangential force density @xmath66 such that @xmath67 inside the bl . the total tangential force exerted by the wall on the fluid",

    "this lateral inhomogeneity is an important source for the tangential component of the wall force .",
    "away from the fluid - solid boundary , each fluid molecule can interact with many wall molecules on a nearly equal basis .",
    "thus the modulation amplitude of the wall potential would clearly decrease with increasing distance from the wall .",
    "hence the tangential wall force tends to saturate at the relatively short range of @xmath44 . on the contrary ,",
    "the normal wall force directly arises from the wall - fluid interaction , independent of whether the wall potential is `` rough '' or not .",
    "consequently , the normal wall force saturates much slower than the tangential component .",
    "the md results presented in this paper were obtained from simulations using solid walls constructed by two [ 001 ] planes of an fcc lattice . we have also carried out md simulations using thicker confining walls .",
    "first we changed the number of molecular layers ( [ 001 ] planes of fcc lattice ) from two to four in constructing each of the two walls .",
    "the wall - fluid interaction potential @xmath9 were still cut off at @xmath14 .",
    "it turned out that neither component of the wall force shows any noticeable change .",
    "the reason is that for the tangential component , the two outer planes are too distant to contribute to the roughness of the wall potential , while for the normal component , the fluid molecules closest to the wall are separated from the two outer planes by a distance @xmath225 .",
    "consequently , both the interface and velocity profiles do not show any noticeable change .",
    "additional wall layers do not contribute to the perceived modulation of the wall potential by the fluid molecules .",
    "nevertheless , they can still affect the tangential wall force by modifying the organization of the fluid molecules near the wall .",
    "such organization is governed by the wall - fluid interaction and can be greatly influenced by the normal wall force .",
    "to see the effects of normal wall force due to additional wall layers , we used four [ 001 ] planes of an fcc lattice plus a half - space continuum in constructing a wall .",
    "the first four solid layers show the atomic structure detectable by the fluid molecules while the half - space continuum models the deeper solid layers .",
    "the wall - fluid interaction was modelled as follows . for an in - range pair of fluid and wall molecules separated by a distance @xmath226 ,",
    "the interaction potential is still @xmath9 . here",
    "the wall molecule must be from one of the four solid layers .",
    "in addition to this short - range interaction , the fluid molecules can also experience the long - range interaction potential due to ( 1 ) the distant wall molecules in the four solid layers and ( 2 ) the continuum . for ( 1 ) we integrated the @xmath227 term in @xmath9 over the out - of - range ( @xmath228 ) area of the solid layers while for ( 2 ) we integrated the same term over the half - space continuum . according to this model ,",
    "only the in - range ( @xmath226 ) part of the solid wall shows atomic structure to a fluid molecule while the out - of - range ( @xmath228 ) part is effectively a half - space continuum .",
    "we found that the effect of the long - range normal wall force ( for @xmath229 ) is to attract the fluid molecules to the wall .",
    "in fact the average number density in the bl can increase by @xmath230 once the long - range force is included . as a result ,",
    "the slip coefficient @xmath231 increases by @xmath232 .",
    "this results in small but visible changes in the interface and velocity profiles .",
    "these tests have convinced us that by using two [ 001 ] planes of an fcc lattice to model the solid wall , we have captured the dominant wall - fluid interaction .",
    "in fact , using two molecular layers to model the solid wall has been extensively practiced in the past md simulations @xcite , although in some instances more molecular layers have also been used @xcite , where the accurate modeling of the normal component of the wall - fluid interaction force is important .",
    "irving and kirkwood @xcite have shown that in the hydrodynamic equation of motion ( momentum transport ) , the stress tensor ( flux of momentum ) may be expressed in terms of molecular variables as @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the kinetic contribution to the stress tensor , given by @xmath235 \\left[\\displaystyle\\frac{{\\bf p}_i}{m_i}-{\\bf v}({\\bf r},t)\\right ] \\delta({\\bf x}_i-{\\bf r}),f\\right\\rangle,\\ ] ] and @xmath236 is the contribution of intermolecular forces to the stress tensor , given by @xmath237 here @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 are respectively the mass , momentum , and position of molecule @xmath241 , @xmath242 is the local average velocity , @xmath243 is the force on molecule @xmath241 due to molecule @xmath244 , @xmath245 is the probability distribution function @xmath246 which satisfies the normalization condition @xmath247 and the liouville equation @xmath248,\\ ] ] with @xmath249 being the potential energy of the system , and @xmath250 means taking the average for a probability distribution function @xmath245 .",
    "although widely employed in the stress measurements in md simulations , the above expression for @xmath236 ( eq . ( [ u - stress ] ) ) represents only the leading term in an asymptotic expansion , accurate when the interaction range is small compared to the range of hydrodynamic variation @xcite .",

    "therefore , we have directly measured the @xmath23 component of fluid - fluid interaction forces acting across the @xmath51 bin surfaces , in order to obtain the @xmath265 component of @xmath236 .",
