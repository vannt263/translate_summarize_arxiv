    "the properties of the lightest scalar meson @xmath3 are very important for interpretation of a scalar family and details of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "appearance of a new experimental information and the theory development in the low energy region generated an extensive discussion on this issue ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as for existence of @xmath3 , now it is a commonly accepted fact and this resonance is included back into particle data group s tables .",
    "there is a long story concerning the resonance interpretation of the s - wave amplitude @xmath7 with isospin i=0 .",
    "one of the key moments of this story was a realization ( see e.g. @xcite ) that apart of the resonance @xmath3 term there is an essential background contribution in this energy region .",
    "however there is no evident recipe to divide the @xmath0 amplitude into the resonance and background terms .",
    "the simplest and widely used method is `` adding in phase shift '' of the resonance an background contributions ( ia method in terminology of @xcite ) : @xmath8 the amplitude @xmath7 in this case is : @xmath9    the anzats ( [ add ] ) may be derived from summation of the loop contributions with some extra conditions @xcite . to obtain the resonance parameters from the experimental data one needs an additional assumption about the form of the background contribution @xmath10 .",
    "the best way for a broad resonance is to determine its mass and the width from the pole position in the complex energy plane .",
    "however only the resonance contribution @xmath11 of the entire amplitude ( [ ia ] ) can be continued into the complex energy plane .",
    "thus it is possibly to study the pole position but not the pole residue .",
    "other methods to describe the @xmath1 phase shift , different from ( [ add ] ) , either have the so evident defects , or are much more complicated with many free parameters .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a very simple analytical parameterization for @xmath0 amplitude which allows us to continue it to the second riemann sheet .",
    "the amplitude contains ( in spirit of the linear @xmath12-model ) two bare objects : the resonance and the background .",
    "the main idea is that a joint unitarization of two objects should be described correctly by the field theory methods . as concerning the form of a background contribution at the tree level",
    ", it can be modelled by a maximally simple method .",
    "there are different ways to construct such analytical amplitude .",
    "we found the suitable one the formalism of the unitary mixing , the obtained amplitude is analytical and unitary automatically .",
    "such construction is rather flexible which allows us to investigate some different physical situations .",
    "note that from other side the bare pole located at @xmath13 may be considered as some effective cross exchange and its value @xmath14 , obtained from a fit , confirms this interpretation .",
    "as compared with standard n / d method our amplitude with two bare objects automatically has a zero , which is necessary to describe the s - wave low energy data .",
    "if there exist n bare states with the same quantum numbers then the dressing of their propagators should account also the mutual transitions between them .",
    "the process of joint dressing is described in this case by the system of dyson - schwinger equations : @xmath15    here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are bare and dressed propagators respectively , @xmath18 are the self - energy contributions .",
    "let us consider mixing of two resonances ( n=2 ) with one open intermediate state . in this case the solutions of ( [ dyson ] ) are : @xmath19 here @xmath20 in the case of scalar resonances interacting with pion pair , the loops are of the form : @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the subtraction point , @xmath24 are the coupling constants .",
    "the @xmath0 amplitude : @xmath25 where @xmath26    it is evident that ( [ amp ] ) satisfies the elastic unitary condition @xmath27    the above equations can be applied not only for the case of two resonances but also for the `` resonance+background '' situation , when one of the bare poles is located at @xmath28 .",
    "just right this situation arises for the s - wave i=0 @xmath7 amplitude .",
    "one can see from ( [ amp1 ] ) that our amplitude is zero at the point : @xmath29 which should be @xmath30 to reproduce the adler zero .",
    "so we have @xmath31 . , we keep using this notation to stress the presence of two objects in the amplitude",
    ". note by the way that our amplitude ( [ amp ] ) coincides except of notations with the amplitude of ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained from the low - energy bootstrap equations . ]",
    "let @xmath31 be the bare zero of function d(s ) , which stays at the left of real axis after dressing .",

    "+    we can see that our simple model ( [ amp1 ] ) corresponding to joint unitarization of two bare objects : one pole at @xmath28 and another pole at @xmath53 describes successfully the @xmath0 phase shift @xmath43 in the energy region below 900 mev .",
    "we find two poles in the complex s plane : one close to the origin with @xmath54 and the second one with @xmath55 .",

    "background can be modelled either by a pole with @xmath64 or by constant . as a next step one could investigate the more complicated background model : left pole + constant ( just as in the linear @xmath12-model ) .",
    "however since our simple amplitude ( [ amp1 ] ) provides a good description of the experimental data we suppose that inclusion of new degrees of freedom has no meaning .    after the fit of the experimental data we found the presence of two complex poles at the second riemann sheet : one close to the origin with @xmath65 and the second one with @xmath66 .",
    "the close pole was seen in most of the previous analyses of @xmath0 scattering ( its position is defined mainly by adler zero ) and it was associated with the lightest scalar meson @xmath3 . note that we approximated the background term at the tree level by some pole , physically it corresponds to the cross - exchange by @xmath67- or @xmath12-meson .",
    "the existing experimental data certainly prefer the pole form of background as compared with constant .    as for behavior of the poles in the limit of @xmath68",

    "it was seen only in a few previous analysis , e.g. in @xcite , where it was considered as an artefact since it was located out of the considered energy region . in our analysis with account of the much more exact data from @xmath35 decay , this pole has moved to lower value @xmath73 . as for its imaginary part , it is rather uncertain ( see table 1 ) and may be abnormally large for resonance state . we suppose that further fate of this pole may be solved by an analysis in the extended energy region .    in any case it is clear that in fact we have the joint complex `` @xmath74 '' , which should be studied jointly and by the adequate methods .",

    "there are ten parameters : bare masses @xmath79 , coupling constants @xmath80 and 6 subtraction parameters in the loops .",
    "we can perform a transformation of propagators and coupling constants , which does not change the amplitude : @xmath81 let us make few transformations consequently :    1 .",
