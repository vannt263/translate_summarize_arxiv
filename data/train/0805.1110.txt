    "we have determined our detection limit by adding sine waves ( frequencies 100300@xmath5 ) to the ntt light curve and recalculating periodograms .",
    "we find that sine waves with amplitudes of 5mmag or greater would be reliably detected .",
    "this detection limit applies specifically to a pulsation which is coherent and persists through the full dataset with a sinusoidal shape . if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the detection limit would increase .",
    "the pulsations found by @xcite had amplitudes of approximately 10mmag , which would easily have been detected by our observations .",
    "the ntt light curve does show a clear sinusoidal photometric variation with a period of about 45min , which is much longer than expected for zzceti - like pulsations @xcite .",
    "we have calculated periodograms for the individual nights and for the data from both nights .",
    "the individual nights give unambiguous periods of @xmath6 and @xmath7 min .",
    "the periodogram for the combined dataset , however , has a large number of peaks , including many at low frequencies which are related to the duration of observations on individual nights ( fig.[fig:2205:lcplot ] ) .",
    "the two highest alias peaks correspond to periods of 44.8min and 43.5min ; the first of these is within 1@xmath8 of the mean of the two period measurements from the two individual nights , and the second differs by 3@xmath8 .",
    "we therefore identify the first periodicity as dominant variation in our light curves .",
    "a sine fit gives a final photometric period of @xmath3min .",
    "non - radial pulsations have previously been observed in the wd in sdssj2205 on two occasions @xcite , but were not detectable in our own observations .",
    "it is possible that amplitude variation could have taken the pulsations beyond our detection limit , which requires a physical explanation .",
    "given the current sparse observational coverage , it is plausible that the mode amplitude variations observed are induced by changes in driving .",
    "the timescales of amplitude variation in sdssj2205 and other similar objects which have several epochs of observations ( e.g.  sdssj0131 , @xcite ; gwlib , @xcite ) appear to be months to years . driving and damping rates in the instability strip for hydrogen - envelope ( da ) wds",
    "have been calculated to be around @xmath9s@xmath10 to @xmath11s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "there are some differences due to the solar chemical composition in the envelopes of da wds in cvs , but these rates should have a similar order of magnitude .",
    "thus it is possible that subtle changes in the driving and damping characteristics could explain order unity variations of the driven modes on the timescales relevant for sdssj2205 .",
    "such variations in the properties of the driving zone have several possible physical origins , which we now discuss .",
    "the most obvious source of possible variations in driving the pulsations , changes in accretion , is also the most challenging from a physical viewpoint . by virtue of the nature of the driving mechanism ,",
    "the thermal timescale of the driving region , on which its temperature structure can change , is similar to the mode period @xcite and therefore short compared to the driving timescale . as a result , in the absence of significant heat sources in this region , the thermal profile in the driving region",
    "is set by the heat flux rising from the underlying layers having longer thermal timescales .",
    "the surface luminosity of the wd in accretion quiescence derives from the compression of the accreted material throughout the accreted envelope @xcite .",
    "only a very small outer portion of the envelope can respond on timescales of months to years , and this portion contributes only a small fraction of the energy flux streaming out through the mode - driving region @xcite .",
    "thus only large accretion events , such as superoutbursts , should be able to modify the thermal profile in the driving region .",
    "in such a case enough material is accreted that the driving region and layers with longer thermal timescales are replaced by material accreted at a high rate .",
    "this will then take some time to cool back to the state defined by the flux from the deepest layers @xcite .",
    "such an event would have either been noticed directly or , failing that , would show up as a significant change in the overall system brightness with respect to previous epochs , which we do not observe .    while variation in direct response to accretion is therefore unlikely",
    ", this leaves the possible explanation that sdssj2205 had , at the time of our observations , cooled enough since its last superoutburst to leave the instability strip , but only future epochs of observations will tell .",
    "if true , this would be an exciting first for cv pulsators .",
    "the short - period cv wzsge had a superoutburst in 2001 july , and observations up to three years after this cataclysmic event have shown that the wd is still cooling @xcite .",
    "another way to heat the wd surface is via infall heating arising directly from the impact of fresh material .",
    "the accretion rate necessary to raise the @xmath4  above that which is set by the underlying flux from envelope compression is only a few percent of the time - averaged accretion rate @xcite .",
    "thus it is possible to temporarily raise the wd @xmath4  with an episode of fairly mild accretion , which , even if it were months long , might go unnoticed in a dim object like sdssj2205 .",
    "however , this type of heating _ does not affect the driving _",
    ", because it is unable to penetrate to the driving region .",
    "the temperature in the driving region is @xmath12k so mild increases in the photospheric temperature ( which would navely appear to push the wd out of the instability strip ) in fact have no significant effect on the thermal profile at the depths where energy is being pumped into the pulsation modes .",
    "the impure composition in the atmospheres of wds in cv is an essential ingredient for the mode - driving features observed in these systems @xcite , particularly the enhanced helium abundance .",
    "this means that changes in the composition of the driving layers will be reflected in the balance between driving and damping of modes .",
    "if accretion were to cease completely , the timescale for helium to settle out of the convection zone and thus the driving layer for @xmath13k is of the order of months @xcite .",
    "however the rate of accretion of material with a solar - like composition need only be @xmath14@xmath15yr@xmath10 to maintain a similar composition at the driving layer .",
    "thus changes in the quiescent accretion have the potential to induce compositional variation in the driving layers on the timescales of interest .",
    "however , it is not clear that such variations would be enough to cause significant changes in mode driving .",
    "more detailed study would be necessary to characterize the time dependence of the chemical structure of the driving layers , and the concomitant impact on the driving . additionally , without quantitative constraints on the properties of quiescent accretion , which are difficult due to the low accretion rates involved",
    ", conclusions will remain ambiguous even with detailed modelling .",
    "variations in mode amplitude and therefore driving are not the only viable explanation for the observed amplitude variations .",
    "another possibility is variations in the visibility of any given pulsation mode . under the influence of rotation",
    "each mode will have a unique surface eigenfunction @xcite .",
    "additionally , the flux perturbations of different modes are modified by the non - adiabatic surface layers in a way which depends on period and the presence of other modes @xcite . in light of the changes in these surface layer which can be achieved by variations in quiescent accretion and the possibility of obscuration by that accretion or other system components , a number of system features could influence the visibility of any given mode .",
    "this type of effect has a much wider variety of timescales over which observed amplitude variations could occur .",
    "more continuous monitoring of pulsation properties would provide constraints on whether this type of mechanism is at work in these systems .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ]    in the context of our program to measure the basic properties of the cvs identified by the sdss , we present vlt spectroscopy and ntt photometry of the faint short - period system sdssj220553.98 + 115553.7 .",
    "this object has twice previously been observed to exhibit low - amplitude brightness variations characteristic of nonradial pulsations @xcite . using radial velocities measured from the h@xmath2 emission line in the vlt spectra we find a high - precision orbital period of @xmath1min , which is close to the observed minimum period for cvs with hydrogen - rich secondary stars .",
    "our light curves of sdssj2205 cover ten hours over two consecutive nights with an observing cadence of 45s .",
    "they have a clear sinusoidal variation on a period of @xmath3min .",
    "this period is not clearly related to the orbital period or to pulsations , and has not been detected in previous observations of sdssj2205 .",
    "unexplained periodicities have been observed in other cvs with pulsating wds , for example gwlib @xcite , hs2331 + 3905 @xcite and sdssj133941.12 + 484727.5 @xcite .",
    "sdssj2205 is unusual in this company , in that its photometric period is substantially shorter than its orbital period .",
    "we have not found any periodicities in the light curves which are clearly attributable to gwlib pulsations , to a detection limit of 5mmag in amplitude .",
    "this is in conflict with the optical pulsation amplitudes of 911mmag found by @xcite .",
    "we also have no evidence for significant changes in brightness over longer timescales , which might otherwise have indicated that the wd was contributing a smaller proportion of the light of the system . at the two epochs of the sdss survey ( imaging and spectroscopic ) , over the four nights of our own observations , and during one night of data presented by @xcite , sdssj2205 has always been found near magnitude 20.1 .",
    "there are several potential explanations for the lack of observable pulsations in sdssj2205 .",
    "firstly , it is possible for destructive interference to make pulsations unobservable for a few hours @xcite , but this would be extremely unlikely to occur for ten hours spread over two nights . a second possibility is cessation or changes in driving due to modification of the thermal state of the driving region .",
    "such changes have several possible origins .",
    "if pulsations do not return in future observations , it is likely that , in cooling since its last dwarf nova superoutburst , the object has just left the instability strip .",
    "this behaviour is expected for cv pulsators , but this would be the first time it has been observed . however , it is entirely possible that the current absence of pulsations is a temporary state .",
    "modification of thermal properties of the driving region due to variation in the accretion rate can be excluded because a large increase in accretion would be required , whereas no change in the brightness of the system was observed .",
    "accretion heating of the surface of the wd is also not viable , since it does not affect the driving layer .",
    "changes in driving might also arise from changes in the chemical composition of the driving layer .",
    "the plausability of such changes depends on an extremely low quiescent accrection rate , which is difficult to justify .",
    "after changes in driving , a third distinct possibility for variation is changes in the visibility of pulsation modes over the surface of the star .",
    "distinguishing between the several possible origins for pulsation amplitude variation depends on new observations of systems exhibiting pulsations .",
    "most essential for this purpose are constraints on the timescale over which the variations take place , which necessitates more frequent epochs of observation than have been taken to date .",
