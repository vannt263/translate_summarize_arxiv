    "models for baryogenesis tie together cosmology and particle physics  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of small neutrino masses  @xcite and their explanation _ via _ lepton - number violating majorana masses and the see - saw mechanism strongly supports the leptogenesis mechanism  @xcite .",
    "an alternative to this scenario is to assume pure dirac mass terms for the neutrinos , that is the absence of majorana masses , and to induce an asymmetry between the left- and right - handed neutrinos , which is subsequently turned into baryon number through sphaleron transitions .",
    "this idea is referred to as dirac leptogenesis  @xcite .    in many scenarios for baryogenesis",
    "the necessary @xmath0 and @xmath1 violation occur simultaneously , induced by a matrix of yukawa couplings .",
    "an exception is electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite , where in first place a @xmath1-violating axial asymmetry is produced which is subsequently not erased _ via _ equilibration .",
    "parity violation is then contributed in a second step due to sphaleron interactions .    also dirac leptogenesis relies on the transition of an axial asymmetry into baryons through the sphaleron process .",
    "the initial asymmetry is stored within dirac neutrinos and does not get erased due to equilibration until electroweak symmetry breaking since the yukawa coupling to the standard model higss field is tiny . while the @xmath1 asymmetry can be provided through a matrix of yukawa couplings and the out - of equilibrium decay of heavy scalar particles into dirac neutrinos  @xcite , it has been suggested that also a single dirac mass term can source @xmath1 , provided it is time dependent . this mass term can arise due to yukawa couplings of neutrinos to a rolling scalar field , and",
    "the resulting mechanism has been named single field baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "recently , an interesting realisation of this mechanism through a decaying affleck dine condensate has been proposed  @xcite .    interpreting the scalar condensate oscillating around _",
    "zero _ as a large amount of scalar quanta at zero momentum , the axial asymmetry can be generated due to the perturbative decay of these particles , as commonly assumed in scenarios for affleck - dine baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "however particles can also be produced nonperturbatively , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a process which is often referred to as preheating in the context of the decay of the inflaton  @xcite .",
    "various aspects of preheating from the decay of flat directions are discussed in  @xcite .    in parallel , in the coherent baryogenesis  @xcite scenario , the oscillating condensate leads directly and at tree - level to the production of a charge asymmetry during preheating when it couples to matter such that a time - dependent @xmath0 and @xmath1 violating mass matrix arises .",
    "consequently , in the case of a single time - dependent mass term a preheating process can lead to an axial asymmetry  @xcite and thereby source single field baryogenesis .",
    "in the present analysis , we focus on the importance of non - perturbative contributions to the baryon asymmetry , and we choose the single field model due to its simplicity .",
    "we emphasise nonetheless that nonperturbative particle production may be of relevance for other scenarios , _",
    "e.g _ affleck - dine baryogenesis .",
    "let us begin by considering a simple toy - model potential @xmath2 the fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 are scalar and are multiplets of the electroweak group @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , while @xmath8 with the components @xmath9 and @xmath10 are weyl fermions .",
    "the scalar mass eigenstates are then @xmath11+\\im[\\phi_d]\\right)$ ] and @xmath12+\\re[\\phi_d]\\right)$ ] , both with mass @xmath13 , and eigenstates , @xmath14+\\im[\\phi_d]\\right)$ ] and @xmath15+\\re[\\phi_d]\\right)$ ] with mass @xmath16 .",
    "the inflationary hubble rate is given by @xmath17 , and we assume that both of these mass eigenvalues are slightly below this value . therefore , at horizon exit the scalar fields get amplified up to a magnitude @xmath18 and a random direction in @xmath19-space .",
    "inflationary expansion then leaves behind a homogeneous vacuum expectation value for the scalar fields in our patch of the universe .",
    "this induces large neutrino masses , such that they initially do not thermalise . in turn , the potential for @xmath20 does not get altered by thermal corrections .",
    "since we are interested in neutrino production , in the following , we consider only the neutral components @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , since the asymmetry is produced from @xmath22 , we take this to be the source field as in the single field baryogenesis scenario .",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath23 .",
    "coherent oscillations begin at the time when the hubble rate has decreased to the value @xmath24 , and the solution for @xmath25 can be approximated for small small @xmath26 by @xmath27&=&\\left[a_1^r \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\mu^2-m^2}t\\right )               + a_2^r \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\mu^2+m^2}t\\right)\\right]a^{-3/2}(t)~,\\\\ \\im[\\phi_u^0]&=&\\left[a_1^i \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\mu^2-m^2}t\\right )               + a_2^i \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\mu^2+m^2}t\\right)\\right]a^{-3/2}(t)~ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the values of @xmath28 are random initial values arising from inflation , as described above , and @xmath29 denotes the scale factor of the universe , @xmath30 denotes comoving time . in order to keep the present discussion simple , we assume @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in our patch of the universe . under these conditions , the charge density carried by the field @xmath25 is given by @xmath35 \\approx a^{-3 } \\mu a^r a^i \\sin\\left(\\frac{m^2}{\\mu}t\\right)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we expanded in @xmath36 and neglected time derivatives acting on the scale factor . according to the interaction term with the leptons in the potential  ( [ potential : interactions ] ) , @xmath37 is transferred to a charge asymmetry within the left handed neutrinos when @xmath25 decays . due to conservation of total lepton number , a precisely opposite amount of the asymmetry is stored within the right handed neutrinos . however",
    ", this asymmetry in the right - handed sector is not transferred into baryons by sphalerons due to the left - handed nature of interactions .",
    "we assume that the universe is radiation dominated when coherent oscillations commence and that this remains so until the scalar fields decay , such that they contribute only negligibly to the entropy density @xmath38 . just like @xmath37",
    ", @xmath38 scales down as @xmath39 , such that we find for the asymmetry within left - handed neutrinos at the time @xmath40 , when the scalar field decays , @xmath41 here , we have used the relations @xmath42  , @xmath43 and have taken @xmath44 . the number of relativistic degrees of freedom is denoted by @xmath45 , such that @xmath46 is a numerical constant of order _ one _ for realistic values of @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that @xmath25 decays at a total rate @xmath47 , whereas the decay rate into neutrinos is given by @xmath48 , such that a branching factor of @xmath49 arises .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the axial asymmetry induced by the nonperturbative decay of @xmath25 .",
    "we do so by solving numerically the conformally rescaled dirac equation @xmath50\\psi=0\\,.\\ ] ] we take @xmath51 such that by the potential  ( [ potential : interactions ] ) , we have @xmath52,\\quad m_i = a\\lambda_\\nu\\im[\\phi_u^0]~. \\label{m : phi}\\ ] ] furthermore , we introduce the conformal time @xmath53 , which is related to comoving time as @xmath54 , and we take @xmath55 .",
    "let us introduce the positive and negative frequency mode functions , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "they form a basis for the dirac field , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the helicity two - eigenspinor , @xmath60 .",
    "the dirac equation then decomposes into @xmath61 from @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we can define the quantities @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the charge density ,",
    "@xmath66 the axial charge density , @xmath67 the scalar density and @xmath68 the pseudoscalar density . note that one can easily show that @xmath65 is conserved by eq .",
    "( [ lhrh ] ) , reflecting the charge conservation of the dirac neutrinos .    the initial conditions corresponding to a particle number @xmath69 are @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "since we assume to have initially zero neutrinos , we take @xmath73 in the following .    when @xmath25 ceases to oscillate ,",
    "the particle number is given by @xmath74 of course there is no charge asymmetry , since there is an opposite amount of antiparticles .",
    "however , when @xmath75 , an asymmetry in the number of particles with positive ( @xmath76 ) and negative ( @xmath77 ) helicity may be generated .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath78 , @xmath79 , since then chirality and helicity coincide .",
    "therefore , @xmath80 when the masses vanish .",
    "the factor _ two _ on the left hand side occurs because the total axial asymmetry gets contributions from particles and antiparticles , while @xmath81 counts just the particles .    with a prime denoting a derivative _ w.r.t .",
    "_ @xmath53 , the scalar equation of motion reads @xmath82 during radiation expansion , @xmath83 , and when @xmath84 , the solution to this equation is well approximated by @xmath85 ( a_r\\eta)^{-3/2}{\\rm e}^{-\\frac 14 \\gamma a_r \\eta^2}\\,,\\ ] ] with the same assumptions for the real and imaginary parts as in the previous section .",
    "we use this solution to obtain the dirac neutrino mass term  ( [ m : phi ] ) and numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ lhrh ] ) by integrating up to the time when @xmath86 , such that the dirac mass term ceases to oscillate and the axial charges @xmath87 get frozen in . a typical plot of the spectrum of the generated charge charge asymmetry is given in fig .  [ f3_k ] .",
    "particle production occurs at a time @xmath88 when the fermionic mode is in resonance with the coherently oscillating field .",
    "the production of the soft modes with small momentum @xmath89 is suppressed because the initial charge asymmetry in the scalar field is small @xmath90 , _ cf . _ eq .",
    "( [ asymmetry : perturbative ] ) .",
    "consequently , the production of asymmetry within modes which resonate later becomes stronger first .",
    "eventually , there is a damping effect due to the red - shifting of the oscillating condensate and finally due to its decay at the rate @xmath47 .",
    "note that due to pauli blocking @xmath91 .",
    "of course , the axial asymmetry vanishes in the case when the scalar charge  ( [ charge : scalar ] ) is _",
    "zero_. when @xmath92 , the term @xmath93 in the dirac equation  ( [ dirac : eqn ] ) vanishes and there is obviously no @xmath1-violation . when @xmath94 but @xmath95 there is also _ zero _ scalar charge .",
    "since then the phase is constant , @xmath96 , the @xmath97-term can in principle be removed at all times by a rephasing of the fermionic field .",
    "consequently , even if we do not perform this rephasing , we expect to find @xmath98 , which can also be verified numerically .    the axial charge density stored within the neutrinos is is the integral over the asymmetry within the modes @xmath99 where @xmath89 is to be understood as the physical momentum at the time when coherent oscillations begin .",
    "the axial asymmetry to entropy ratio then turns out to be @xmath100 which we want to compare with the perturbative result  ( [ asymmetry : perturbative ] ) .",
    "we denote the axial densities @xmath101 by @xmath102 for the nonperturbative or resonant case of eq .",
    "( [ asymmetry : resonant ] ) and by @xmath103 for the perturbative decay as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ asymmetry : perturbative ] ) .",
    "the initial amplitudes of the scalar field are chosen to be @xmath104 .",
    "we display the produced axial asymmetries over the initial amplitudes in figs .",
    "[ q_l:1 ] and  [ q_l:3 ] , where we have taken different values for the damping rate @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , the perturbative source @xmath103 gets enhanced by the factor @xmath49 in  ( [ asymmetry : perturbative ] ) as the damping @xmath47 becomes smaller .",
    "note that we have consistently chosen @xmath105 with the case @xmath106 displayed in fig .",
    "[ q_l:3 ] .",
    "but also the nonperturbative contribution grows for smaller decay rates , because coherent oscillations last longer and a larger phase space volume may be filled as the fermionic modes are red - shifted .",
    "however , while initially @xmath103 and @xmath102 grow as the square of the initial scalar amplitude , @xmath102 gets suppressed for large amplitudes due to pauli blocking , which we do not take into account in our formula for the perturbative asymmetry  ( [ asymmetry : perturbative ] ) . in either case as displayed in figs .",
    "[ q_l:1 ] and  [ q_l:3 ] , we note that the total asymmetry is the sum of the individual contributions , @xmath107 .",
    "nonperturbatively sourced single field baryogenesis is a viable scenario .",
    "we have shown that it contributes over a wide range of parameter space by the same order of magnitude as the perturbative source to the baryon asymmetry .",
    "note that a rescaling of the yukawa coupling @xmath108 can be absorbed into different intitial amplitudes @xmath109 , such that the effect can be read of from figs .",
    "[ q_l:1 ] and  [ q_l:3 ] . besides the model presented here ,",
    "the coherent baryogenesis mechanism is an example for generating the bayon asymmetry directly from preheating .",
    "we conclude that processes of nonperturbative particle production may be of importance for explaining the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
