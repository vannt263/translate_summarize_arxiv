    "a stellar mass compact object ( a black hole or a neutron star ) moves in the spacetime of a supermassive black hole in an ( accelerated ) orbit , emitting low - frequency gravitational waves in the good sensitivity band of space borne detectors such as lisa . in this paper",
    "we model a likely scenario in galactic nuclei , specifically the capture of compact stellar - size objects by a supermassive black hole , like those that exist in the center of many galaxies .",
    "because of the high mass ratio , the compact object may be approximated by a point particle , and the orbital evolution modeled by perturbation theory .",
    "the emission of gravitational waves by a point - particle falling into a black hole has been modeled by several researchers using a frequency - domain ( fd ) decomposition of the master equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references cited therein ) @xcite .",
    "the fd approach allows for very accurate determination of the energy flux and the waveforms for wide classes of orbits that include orbits characterized by low values of the eccentricity .",
    "generic orbits and especially high eccentricity orbits , although in principle amenable to a fourier decomposition and a fd construction of the waveforms @xcite , require the summation of many terms in the fourier series , which limits the accuracy and increases the computation time @xcite .",
    "this weakness of the fd approach is not shared with the time - domain ( td ) approach  @xcite that we present here .",
    "indeed , wave generation is typically one of the strengths of td approaches .",
    "we expect a td approach to be more efficient and yield more accurate results ( for waveforms ) especially in the context of highly elliptic and parabolic orbits compared with fd calculations .",
    "td calculations can also serve as an independent test of fd results .",
    "calculations in the td have only recently been introduced for the cases of equatorial circular particle orbits  @xcite and also for equatorial elliptic orbits and inclined circular orbits  @xcite around a rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "these calculations , however , suffer from low accuracy , as was manifest in deviations by as much as @xmath0@xmath1 in the determination of the energy flux when compared with the highly accurate fd results .",
    "indeed , it is this crudity of td calculations that was the main reason why so few td calculations have been done . here , we report on a significant improvement in the accuracy of td calculations , that brings them to within @xmath2 agreement with the fd counterparts or better .",
    "then , we apply our approach to a special class of orbits , namely `` zoom  whirl '' orbits of both elliptic @xcite and parabolic type .",
    "as was recently pointed out in @xcite , adiabatic waveforms that ignore the gravitational wave backreaction on the orbit may yield so - called  kludge \" waveforms , that are surprisingly accurate for much of the parameter space of extreme - mass - ratio binary motion .",
    "we adopt here a similar approach , and neglect the effects of radiation reaction , hoping to address them elsewhere .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to serve as a _ proof - of - concept _ that td calculations of gravitational waveforms can be accurate  specifically where fd calculations have weaknesses  and hence be of practical importance for waveform generation .",
    "this paper is not intended to serve as a reference for tables of results , or to exhaustively cover the relevant parameter space . the latter ",

    "we demonstrate the greatly improved accuracy of our approach by reproducing results obtained with fd calculations to within @xmath2 .",

    "( [ te ] ) explicitly , we obtain an explicit but quite complicated form for the source term .",

    "the methodology for numerically evolving the homogeneous part of ( [ te ] ) has been presented in detail @xcite .",

    "note that we take the initial data for the fields to be zero .",
    "since we are considering the teukolsky equation with a source , this choice corresponds to the particle `` appearing suddenly , '' which generates an artificial burst of spurious radiation , that decays fast .",
    "we handle this difficulty by evolving to late times and computing fluxes only after the system has `` settled down . ''",
    "we used the highly accurate public domain integrator `` geod '' @xcite  which we call from within our teukolsky code  to update the particle s position at every time step .    finally , to obtain the power (  total energy flux \" ) due to gravitational wave emission from the binary , we find the teukolsky function @xmath10 at a set radial location in the grid far from the horizon , and compute @xcite @xmath11\\ , .",

    "the numerical implementation of this work is in the form of a set of 2 + 1 dimensional linear pde s that uses the lax  wendroff evolution scheme .",
    "this approach , including convergence and stability , is described in @xcite .",
    "we test the accuracy of our code by performing standard convergence tests , and we find the code to converge with second order .",
    "we also tested the code by comparing our results for the energy flux in gravitational waves with those obtained with fd calculations .",
    "specifically , we compare circular and equatorial orbits for schwarzschild and kerr black holes , where the fd fluxes are known to high accuracy .    as discussed above , earlier td calculations suffered from crude accuracy , with energy fluxes typically deviating from their fd counterparts by 1020% .",
    "analysis of the reasons for that crudity allowed us to attribute it primarily to the relatively coarse grids used in @xcite , and to the relatively small size of the computational domain , which required the evaluation of the field only a small number of wavelengths from the source , in addition to unoptimized modeling of the point particle .",
    "moreover , there exists a typographical sign error in the expression for @xmath16 in ref .",
    "@xcite which was used in @xcite for computing the source - term .",
    "this wrong sign introduces a significant error in the strong - field region of the black hole space - time , but has little impact when orbits with large radii are considered .",
    "finally , it should also be noted that the extra normalization factor as used before ( see eq .  20 in  @xcite ) is actually inappropriate in the context of our computation . in our current code",
    "we have fixed the sign error as mentioned above and removed this improper normalization .",
    "also , owing to certain optimization and performance improvements to the code , we can now have much larger grid sizes  and therefore extract the waveforms and compute the fluxes at a distance much farther than in @xcite  and also have much higher resolution .    epsf   in a circular equatorial orbit of radius @xmath17 about a kerr black hole with spin parameter @xmath18 .",

    "our typical grid resolutions are @xmath23 ( radial ) and @xmath24 ( angular ) .",
    "modeling the particle by a gaussian distribution requires optimization of the number of grid points @xmath20 that are used to sample the gaussian : for a given grid resolution , too many grid points cause the physical width of the gaussian to spread too much resulting in large deviations from the point - particle approximation .",
    "on the other hand , too few grid points cause the gaussian to be `` under - sampled , '' introducing unwanted errors into the computation . through extensive numerical experimentation",
    ", we have found the optimal number of grid points across the gaussian for our chosen grid resolution to be about five .",

    "the interesting features of these waveforms are as follows : the emitted waves become very prominent as the particle approaches the periastron , and fall off rapidly when the particle moves away from the hole .",
    "note that the part of the waveform from the `` whirl '' seems to be similar to one coming from an exact circular orbit of the same angular velocity .",

    "known circular orbit results .",
    "notice that although the parabolic orbit is symmetric ( about the @xmath54-axis , i.e. , the  zoom in \" phase of he orbit is symmetrical to the  zoom out \" phase ) , the waveforms and the energy flux are not symmetrical . specifically , notice the oscillations in ( the lower panel of ) fig .  7 , that are visible only during the  zoom out \" phase .",
    "the reason for this asymmetry is that during the  zoom out \" phase of the orbit , the waves include also the waves emitted during the  zoom in \" and the  whirl \" phases , that backscatter off the curvature of spacetime .",

    "this difference may have implications on the number of modes that needs to be computed .",
