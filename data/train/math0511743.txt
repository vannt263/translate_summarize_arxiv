    "the genealogy back to the most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) of those currently alive , and especially the time back to the mrca , has been an ongoing object of interest in mathematical population genetics , see @xcite , @xcite for early references and @xcite for a recent monograph .",
    "the limit of effective population size @xmath7 , with time measured in units of @xmath2 generations , is the scaling in which kingman s coalescent appears ( @xcite ) : in the rescaled time measured backward from a fixed time @xmath0 , the number of _ ancestral lineages",
    "_ enters from infinity and jumps from @xmath8 to @xmath9 at rate @xmath10 .",
    "( here and below we assume that the population size remains constant in time . ) the depth @xmath11 of the _ coalescent tree _ , that is the rescaled time it takes the number of ancestral lineages to decrease from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , is then a sum of exponentially distributed random variables with mean @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and consequently has expectation @xmath16 .    with the population evolving further , also its genealogical relationships given by the coalescent tree change . in this study",
    "we are interested in the time evolution of one particular characteristics of the genealogy , that is , the time @xmath17 when the mrca of the population at time @xmath0 lived",
    ". we will refer to @xmath18 as the _ mrca process_.    at any time @xmath0 the total population consists of two oldest families , which stem from the two oldest lines of descent dating back to the mrca who lived at time @xmath1 .",
    "these two families will coexist for a while after time point @xmath0 , and during this time interval the path of the mrca process @xmath19 stays constant . at some random time @xmath20",
    ", one of the two families will go extinct and the other one will fixate in the population .",
    "the mrca of this surviving family must be more recent than @xmath1 , which amounts to a jump of the mrca process at time @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , at time @xmath21 , the next mrca is established , and the time when this next mrca lives is @xmath22 . in other words , the path of the process @xmath19 is constant as long as the two currently oldest families coexist in the population , and jumps from @xmath1 to @xmath23 at time @xmath21 when one of the two families fixates .",
    "the mrca process is embedded in the genealogy of the population which is assumed to evolve in a time stationary way . for a finite population consisting of @xmath2 individuals , a way to construct",
    "the genealogy comes with the graphical representation of the moran model : for each ordered pair @xmath24 of indices @xmath25 , an exponential clock rings at rate @xmath26 , and whenever this happens , the individual with index @xmath27 dies and is replaced by an offspring of the individual with index @xmath28 .",
    "this results in a partitioning of @xmath29 into coalescing ancestral lineages , from which one can read off a version of the mrca process for @xmath2 individuals .",
    "this process clearly inherits time stationarity from the evolution of the population .",
    "the moran dynamics is exchangeable with respect to the individuals indices .",
    "in contrast , the look - down process introduced by donnelly and kurtz ( 1999 ) , which is the basic tool in our study and will be reviewed in section [ 2 ] , arranges the individuals indices ( henceforth referred to as _ levels _ ) at any time according to the persistence of the individuals offspring in the population : the offspring of an individual at level @xmath28 outlives the offspring of any contemporary individual at some higher level . for a finite population number",
    "@xmath2 this is achieved as follows : each level @xmath27 `` looks down '' to each smaller level @xmath28 at rate 1",
    ". whenever this happens , all individuals at levels @xmath30 are pushed one level up , the individual at level @xmath2 is killed , and the individual at level @xmath28 spawns a child at level @xmath27 .",
    "the time stationary mrca process read off from the look - down graph obviously has the same distribution as the time stationary mrca process read off from the moran graph .",
    "the look - down process allows a passage to the limit of infinite population size in which the ordering by persistence is preserved .",
    "the construction of the _ random look - down graph _ on @xmath31 proceeds in the very same way as described above , except that there is no killing of individuals at any finite level .",
    "instead , the offspring of an individual at level @xmath32 goes to extinction as soon as this _ line of ascent _ of the individual is pushed to infinity .",
    "all this will be explained in more detail in section [ 2 ] .    because of the ordering by persistence , each mrca of the population lives at level 1 at some time @xmath6 at which it gives birth to an individual at level 2 .",
    "as soon as the offspring of these two individuals fixates in the population , the mrca is established .",
    "again , because of the ordering by persistence , this happens at the time @xmath5 when the line of ascent which was pushed at time @xmath6 from level 2 to level 3 reaches infinity .",
    "the process @xmath33 , which consists of all pairs of time points when an mrca is established in the population and when it lived , is a time - stationary point process ; we call it the _ mrca point process_. the paths of @xmath19 and the point configurations of @xmath34 are in an obvious one - to - one correspondence .",
    "( a ) at time @xmath1 the mrca of the population at time @xmath0 lived , @xmath21 and @xmath23 are the times when the next mrca is established and when it lived .",
    "( b ) mrcas occur in a time - stationary manner .",

    ", the left axis contains the times when mrcas live , and the right axis gives the times when mrcas are established .",
    "the joint distribution of @xmath21 and @xmath23 will be given in theorem [ th1 ] in section [ 3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : pp](b ) displays part of the mrca point process @xmath34 .",
    "remarkably , not only the points @xmath6 but also the points @xmath5 form a time stationary poisson process , see theorem [ th : full ] in section [ 4 ] .",
    "this will be proved by representing the times @xmath35 as the entrance and exit times of particles : the trajectory of a particle is attached to the line of ascent which is pushed from level 2 to level 3 at time @xmath6 and exits at time @xmath5 .",
    "we will specify the markovian dynamics of this particle system , compute its equilibrium distribution and show that , whenever a particle exits at some time @xmath5 , at this very instant the system of ( remaining ) particles is in equilibrium .",
    "this allows to conclude that the waiting time to the next exit time is exponential .",
    "the processes @xmath19 and @xmath34 , however , are not markov , see remark [ remarkburke].3 .",
    "in theorem 3 we compute the distribution of the random number @xmath36 of mrcas that are established after time @xmath0 and live before time @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , it turns out that the probability that the next mrca lives in today s future is @xmath37 = 1/3 $ ] .    as noted by @xcite , the amount of polymorphism in a population",
    "is related to the fixation of alleles . when an allele fixates , the mrca of the population must have changed . at such a fixation time , the full coalescent is unusually short . as neutral mutations fall independently on the branches of the genealogical tree ,",
    "this means that the amount of polymorphism is low at fixation times .",
    "we start out by reviewing the look - down process in section [ 2 ] , describe our results in sections [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] , point out some relations to population genetics in section [ 6 ] and give the proofs of theorems 1 - 3 in sections [ 7][9 ] .",
    "at every time a continuum population which follows a wright - fisher ( or fleming - viot ) dynamics has a genealogy given by kingman s coalescent . the look - down process introduced by donnelly and kurtz ( @xcite ) not only gives a countable representation of evolving allele frequencies but at the same time stores genealogical relationships of all the individuals alive in the population at all times . consequently the mrca process can be read off from the look - down process .",
    "we first give a brief review of the `` modified look - down process '' ( @xcite ) ; see figure [ figlookdown0 ] for a graphical illustration .",
    "consider the set of vertices @xmath38 we will refer to the vertex @xmath39 as the _ individual at time _",
