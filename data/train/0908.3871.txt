    "anderson s localization theory points out that in a system with uncorrelated diagonal disorder , all one - electron states are spatially localized with an exponentially decaying envelope with a characteristic localization length @xmath9 , when the disorder strength is larger than a critical value.@xmath10 from the scaling theory,@xmath11 it is also well - known that an infinitesimal disorder can cause localization of all states in one and two dimensional systems in the thermodynamic limit . in recent years",
    ", it was found that spatial correlation of disorder potential played an important role in the nature of long - range charge transport of low - dimensional systems . in the presence of short - range correlated disorder",
    ", there exists a set of discrete resonant energy levels of extended states.@xmath12 for example , a single extended eigenstate was found in the random dimer model,@xmath13 which was verified by measuring microwave transmission on the semiconductor superlattices with intentional correlated disorder.@xmath14 these models with short - range correlated disorder do not possess a true disorder induced metal - insulator transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "more recently , a one - dimensional ( 1d ) disordered model with long - range correlation considered by de moura and lyra has arisen a great interest , as it can result in a continue band of extended states under appropriate conditions.@xmath15 the transition from localization to delocalization occurred at the critical points was examined experimentally in a single - mode waveguide with inserted correlated scatters.@xmath16 more recent experiments in ultra - cold atoms / bose - einstein condensate push the research in this direction further .",
    "@xcite    in the disordered systems , the critical parameters , such as the critical disorder strength @xmath17 , mobility edge @xmath18 , critical exponents @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( defined by the dependence of localization length on @xmath7 or @xmath21 near the critical points @xmath22 where the critical parameters for different lattices are calculated and it was found that @xmath19 is close to @xmath20 .",
    "while for 3d systems with scale - free disorder , it was found that @xmath23 and the extended harris criterion is obeyed .",
    "@xmath24    in spite of many studies@xmath25 on the 1d systems with correlated disorder , many of them are in a perturbative level and there are still several important questions to be answered , such as the positions of the mobility edges and the value of the critical exponent @xmath4 .",
    "the determination of these critical parameters and the comparison with the results of 3d models mentioned above will definitely deepen our understanding on disordered systems , especially the dependence on dimensionality and correlation .",
    "moreover , the correlated disordered system is a kind of system which is intermediate between ordered system and pure disordered system .",
    "the investigation of the universal properties of this type system and comparison with quasi - periodic system is of fundamental importance .",
    "in addition , the accurate values of these critical parameters ( mobility edges ) have important applications in charge transport in low dimensional ( correlated ) disordered systems , such dna molecules,@xmath26 , bose - einstein condensate in 1-d optical lattices with speckle potential.@xcite . in the present paper , we calculate these critical parameters for the 1d systems with the correlated diagonal disorder .",
    "and we also resolve some inconsistencies in the literatures.@xmath15 one of the advantages of our study is that we are able to investigate localization - delocalization transition and obtain the accurate critical parameters in 1d system with large size and the boundary effects is negligible , unlike the 3d system where all the sizes in three dimensions can not be very large due to the computational limitation .",
    "we first investigate the localization properties of the 1d tight - binding model with long - range correlated diagonal disorder ( the hopping constant is set to be unity ) .",
    "the diagonal on - site energies @xmath27 are distributed in @xmath28 $ ] with @xmath7 being the strength of disorder .",
    "the site energies have a power - law spectral density @xmath1 with @xmath29 .",
    "the function @xmath30 is the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function @xmath31 and @xmath32 is related to the wavelength @xmath33 of the undulations on the random parameter landscape by @xmath34.@xmath15 we find that the critical disorder width @xmath35 at fixed energy @xmath21 for @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we can determine the positions of the mobility edges @xmath36 , which separate the extended and localized energy eigenstates .",
    "the effective energy band width @xmath37 of the extended states has the linear relationship @xmath38 for @xmath2 .",
    "thus , a phase diagram in the @xmath39 space is obtained .",
    "we also discuss the @xmath8-dependence of the critical exponent @xmath4 of the localization length of the eigenstates .",
    "interestingly , we find that the disorder strength @xmath7 determines the mobility edges and the degree of correlation @xmath8 determines the critical exponents . our results also indicate that the nature of a correlated disordered system is somehow between that of the pure random ( without any correlation ) and pseudo - random ( quasi - periodic ) systems .",
    "our approach is non - perturbative and our results are hard to be obtained by perturbative calculations .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the 1d disordered systems with long - range correlation and the basic approach in our calculation . in section iii",
    ", we present our results of the mobility edge and critical exponents .",
    "the paper is summarized in section iv .",
    "we consider a 1d tight - binding hamiltonian with long - range correlated disorder @xmath40 is the wannier state localized at site @xmath41 with on - site energy @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude .",
    "we set @xmath44 for simplicity .",
    "the on - site energies @xmath45 can be constructed by the fourier filtering method@xmath46 as follows : ( i ) generate a random sequence @xmath47 with a gaussian distribution ; ( ii ) get its fourier components @xmath48 using the fast - fourier transformation method ; ( iii ) establish a new sequence @xmath49 by the relation @xmath50 ; ( iv ) construct the sequence @xmath45 , which is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath49 ; ( v ) adjust the scale of the sequence @xmath45 reaching to @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "it can be checked that the disordered on - site energy @xmath45 is long - range correlated with the power spectrum @xmath51.@xmath52 the exponent @xmath8 characterizing the correlation reflects the roughness of the energy sequence .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath8 is , the smoother the energy landscape is .    the schrdinger equation for the wavefunction amplitudes @xmath53 is @xmath54 here , @xmath21 is the eigenenergy .",
    "our interest focuses on the critical behavior in the thermodynamical limit . a useful way to find the critical points",
    "is based on the finite size analysis of the normalized localization length @xmath55 : @xmath52 if @xmath56 increases as the system size @xmath57 , which implies that @xmath9 would exceed @xmath58 when @xmath58 is large enough , the electron stays on a extended state ; otherwise , the state is localized , because @xmath56 is a decreasing function of @xmath58 and smaller than unity in the thermodynamic limit . so the @xmath58 dependent of @xmath55 can give the information of the localization - delocalization transition .",
    "thereby , we can use this quantity @xmath59 to determine the critical disorder strength at fixed energy and the critical energies at fixed disorder strength .    in the regime of weak disorder",
    ", it was found@xmath60 that the localization length @xmath9 for a state of energy @xmath61 ( not near band center and band edge ) is determined by the correlation function of the disorder potential @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 . for our disordered system with long range correlation with the spectral density @xmath67 ,",
    "the localization length has the normalized form @xmath68 , for @xmath69 ; @xmath70 , for @xmath71 .",
    "thus we see that in the weak disorder regime the states are localized for @xmath8 @xmath72 and @xmath73 is a critical value for the appearance of extended states .    to determine the full phase diagram and study the critical parameters , we use the transfer matrix method . using the two - component vector @xmath74 , where the superscript @xmath75 denotes the transpose , eq .",

    "the reorthogonalization method @xcite has also been used and the same critical parameters are obtained .",

    "we notice that @xmath59 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath58 for @xmath91 ; while the picture is different for @xmath92 : the values of @xmath59 rise with increasing @xmath58 for @xmath95 , whereas the values of @xmath59 decline with increasing @xmath58 for @xmath96 .",

    "unlike three dimensional systems with usually small values of scaling variable ( i.e. the size of cross section ) , in our one - dimensional systems , the irrelevant scaling exponents @xcite are of little effect due to scaling variable with very large values , i.e. , the size of the system .",
