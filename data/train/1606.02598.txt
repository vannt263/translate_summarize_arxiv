    "this causes topological stability .",
    "for example , an isolated magnetic skyrmion@xcite in a planar film with dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) is an excited state of the system ( for the case of low temperature and absence of external magnetic fields ) .",
    "however , this excitation is topologically stable , because the invariant is @xmath4 for the skyrmion,@xcite while @xmath5 for the ground state .",
    "topological stability occurs for a variety of defects in ordered matter , such as disclination loops , hedgehog point defects and knots in nematic liquid crystals;@xcite and vortices@xcite and bloch points@xcite in ferromagnets .",
    "conservation of the topological index @xmath3 for a closed surface raises two fundamental questions : ( i ) what is the lowest energy equilibrium solution @xmath6 for a given @xmath3 , and ( ii ) which @xmath3 corresponds to the ground state for a given surface ?",
    "the answers can lead to new phenomena , specific to the physical system under consideration . in this paper",
    "we answer these questions for the case of thin ferromagnetic spherical shells .",
    "even such a relatively simple model brings a number of surprising results .",
    "we show that for a spherical shell a skyrmion solution exists as a topologically stable excitation above the hedgehog ground state .",
    "an important feature is that the skyrmion may be stabilized by curvature effects only , specifically by the curvature - induced , exchange - driven _ effective _",
    "dmi.@xcite this is in contrast to the planar case , where the intrinsic dmi is required for the skyrmion stabilization.@xcite    the case of the spherical shell is topologically opposite to that of the planar film : the skyrmion has the index @xmath5 , in other words it is topologically trivial , while the ground state is characterized by @xmath4 .",
    "this is due to a shift of the topological index of the vector field , caused by topology of the surface itself .",
    "since the skyrmion solution on a spherical shell is homotopic to a uniform state , it can be induced by means of a uniform external magnetic field , similarly to the excitation of onion magnetic states in nanorings.@xcite in a continuous medium the switching between states with different @xmath3 is topologically forbidden .",
    "however , in discrete spin lattices such a transition is possible , though it requires a strong external influence .",
    "we first present a set of general results valid for an arbitrary thin curvilinear shell . in the following we apply these results to calculate the magnetic energy and topological properties of magnetization states of spherical shells .",

    "the surface element reads @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "since using cartesian components of the vector field @xmath0 is not convenient for curvilinear systems , we will switch to curvilinear coordinates @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the surface normal .",
    "moreover , it is useful to incorporate the constraint @xmath26 by means of the angular parameterization @xmath27 , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent colatitude and longitude , the spherical angles of the local curvilinear basis , respectively . in this case",

    "remarkably , for a strictly normal distribution of the vector field @xmath38 ( normal gau map ) one obtains the well known@xcite result @xmath39 . applying the gau - bonnet theorem we obtain the famous relation @xmath40 between degree of the normal gau map @xmath41 and genus @xmath42 of the surface .",

    "the gyrocoupling vector @xmath46 is the key quantity to describe the dynamics of topologically nontrivial solutions , such as domain walls,@xcite vortices,@xcite skyrmions,@xcite skyrmion lines@xcite and bloch points.@xcite it determines important integrals of motion in the dynamics of ferromagnetic media.@xcite recently it was shown@xcite that @xmath46 is proportional to the emergent magnetic field , which appears due to the hund s coupling between spins of the conducting electrons and localized magnetic moments .",
    "this gives rise to the topological hall effect.@xcite    let us provide physically illustrative explanations why the topological charge or index @xmath3 is an integer number and a conserved quantity .",
    "a direct consequence of the definition of @xmath46 with the constraint @xmath26 is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the dirac delta - function and the vector @xmath53 determines the position of a bloch point ( monopole ) , @xmath54 , whose infinitesimal neighborhood of the center has the structure@xcite @xmath55 . here",
    ", @xmath56 is an arbitrary matrix of three - dimensional rotations and @xmath57 is the monopole charge .",

    "since two monopoles with opposite charges are connected by the dirac string , which may be considered a skyrmion line,@xcite one can also say that @xmath3 is the difference of outgoing and incoming skyrmion lines.@xcite thus the only way to change @xmath3 for a given closed @xmath7 is to replace a monopole across @xmath7 .",
    "when the monopole center crosses the surface , i.e.  it is located exactly on @xmath7 , the vector field @xmath60 is discontinuous at the point @xmath53 .",
    "thus , one can conclude that _ a continuous deformation of the continuous field @xmath61 can not change the mapping degree @xmath3 of @xmath7_. the rigorous proof of the latter statement can be found elsewhere , for instance see ref .  .",
    "the expression for the mapping jacobian is general : it is the key formula for topological analysis of a normalized vector field of an arbitrary physical nature on an arbitrary curvilinear surface .",
    "the topological analysis is independent of the physical nature of the vector field @xmath0 . in the following ,",

    "the last term in @xmath67 is the dmi with the energy density@xcite @xmath68 and the dmi constant , @xmath69 .",
    "this kind of dmi originates from the spin - orbit coupling and is related to the inversion symmetry breaking on the film interface ; it is typical for ultrathin films@xcite or bilayers.@xcite in the curvilinear basis one can represent the dmi density as follows @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the mean curvature , see appendix  [ app : interactions ] for details .",
