    "planetary nebulae are the end products of the evolution of stars with masses below about @xmath4 ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of these objects extends beyond the understanding of how the outer layers of stars end up forming the many observed morphologies .",
    "indeed , pne have been used for many purposes , from understanding basic atomic and plasma processes ( @xcite ) to determining chemical evolution of our galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently pne are also being used to study galaxies other than our own , providing powerful tools to determine distances , kinematics and chemical properties of external galaxies ( @xcite ) and even to trace inter - cluster material as in @xcite .",
    "pne have the advantage that they are observable out to large distances due to their luminous narrow emission lines , especially [ oiii]500.7 nm , being useful also as standard candles through the use of the pn luminosity function ( for extensive discussion see @xcite .",
    "one of the most important problems in observational galactic pne research is the difficulty in determining their distances and three - dimensional structures . observations always produce a 2-d projection of their 3-d structure , and recovering the original structure is not trivial .",
    "this is also made worse by the fact that only crude distances , usually obtained from statistical methods on large samples , can be determined .",
    "large uncertainties are generated by the need to assume constancy of one parameter such as the nebular size , ( ionized ) mass , flux etc .",
    "so that typical errors in the distances to individual objects are of the order of a factor of 3 or more .",
    "very few nebulae have had individual accurate distances determined .",
    "historically , pne have been studied with empirical methods and one dimensional photoionization models , leading to the above mentioned problems .",
    "in contrast to this , our technique developed and described in @xcite provides precise , self - consistently determined distances , as well as the physical parameters for the central star and gaseous nebula , for objects with sufficient observational constraints .",
    "these objects can provide valuable calibration for existing distance scales as well as self - consistently determined physical and chemical quantities .",
    "for a detailed description of our novel method see our previously published papers in this series and especially the extensive explanatory appendix in the second paper @xcite .    in this work we focus on the pn ngc6781 ( ra 19@xmath5 18@xmath6 28@xmath7 dec .",
    "+ 06@xmath8 32 19  2000 . ) shown in figure[imagen6781 ] .",
    "this is a pn whose main structure is observed as a 130  diameter bright shell of low ellipticity , double in parts and with fainter lobes emanating at the n - s ends where the ring is double and fainter .",
    "the ring is brighter in the e - w directions as also shown in figure1 of @xcite .",
    "their image is available as a fits file on the web at http://www.ing.iac.es/  rcorradi and our figure[imagen6781 ] has been produced using this image .",
    "658.4 nm line .",
    "image produced from the original of @xcite .",
    "[ imagen6781 ] ]    @xcite claim a possible faint halo extending out to about 3 by 4 surrounding ngc6781 .",
    "note that @xcite list the object in their paper on the search for faint haloes around bright pne , but do not make any statement about having detected a halo according to their criteria , which include the candidate halo having to be limb brightened andor detached .",
    "the halo of @xcite is not limb brightened and more likely to be the result of scattered light in the instrument .    for a more detailed discussion of the morphology of ngc6781 based on a set of narrow band images , as well as density , temperature , and extinction maps",
    "see @xcite .",
    "an estimate for the luminosity , temperature , and mass of the cs of ngc6781 based on statistical analysis is 127l@xmath1 , 105kk , and 0.6m@xmath1 , respectively , taken from @xcite .",
    "the average distance of the 12 literature values we found in @xcite is 946pc with the individual values ranging from 500 to 1600pc , a factor of more than three .    ]",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xmath9f(@xmath9 ) of ngc6781 shows a broad blackbody - like spectrum between about 1 and 100@xmath10 m , a radio tail out to 12 cm , and a rise toward the blue which probably comes from the hot central star . integrating the f(@xmath9 ) curve we obtain a luminosity of l = 166d@xmath11(kpc ) l@xmath1 .",
    "the luminosity of ngc6781 is therefore 150l@xmath1 at its distance of 950pc .",
    "applying the usual correction according to @xcite we obtain l=225@xmath1 .    here",
    "we present our own modeling results using observational data published in the literature as constraints and derive the 3-d structure , chemical abundances , cs properties , and distance for ngc6781 in a self - consistent manner .    in  2",
    "we discuss the observational data used as constraints for the models . in ",
    "3 we present the model results generated by the 3-d photoionization code , and we discuss the derived quantities . in ",
    "4 we give our overall conclusions and discuss possible discrepancies with other determinations of parameters for this nebula .",
    "the observational data that we used to constrain our model for ngc6781 were taken from the literature .",
    "@xcite presents narrow band imaging of the nebula in the most important lines such as h@xmath12 , h@xmath13 , [ oiii ] and others .",
    "he also provides [ sii ] narrow band images to obtain a spatially resolved density map , as well as the h@xmath12h@xmath13 extinction map of the nebula .",
    "we used their 2-d density map to infer the 3-d density structure to be used as an input for the photoionization model .",
    "@xcite present deep optical spectra of medium resolution for ngc 6781 and 11 other planetary nebulae .",
    "the observations were carried out with a long - slit spectrograph covering from 360 to 800 nm and include all important emission lines .",
    "their observations are particularly interesting because the objects were scanned with the long - slit across the nebular surface by driving the telescope differentially in right ascension .",
    "these observations then yield average spectra for the whole nebula , which are in principle more precise than single slit observations , and allow us to produce emission line maps of the object . for details of the observations and their reduction procedure as well as the full tables of line fluxes , see @xcite .",
    "the most important lines used as constraints for the model are listed in our table[mod - res ] together with the corresponding values from our model .",
    "we also used the h@xmath12+[nii ] image from @xcite to determine the size of ngc6781 thus using it as one of the constraints for the distance obtained in our model calculations .",
    "the photoionization code we used for the study of ngc6781 is the mocassin code described in full detail in @xcite .",
    "this code allows for the same possibilities as the code used previously in @xcite but is more sophisticated in that the diffuse radiation is fully taken into account in an efficient manner .",
    "the previous code also had this ability but the associated increase in computational time was prohibitive .    the basic procedure adopted to study ngc6781 is the same , independent of the code and has been fully described in the two previous papers in this series ( @xcite and ( especially the appendix of ) @xcite ) . in short , we gather as much observational material as possible and use it to constrain our model with many data simultaneously .",
    "of particular interest are the total line fluxes and line images corrected for reddening , and the line diagnostic ratio maps .",
    "the structure adopted for the nebulae is defined based on the observed density map , when available , or density profiles from single slit observations plus the observed projected morphology in several emission lines .    in the case of ngc6781 in particular ,",
    "the initial structure was based on density maps published by @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the images and density map ( from the [ sii ] doublet ratio ) presented here , that the density is lower in the central region than in the main bright ring .",
    "this indicates that the structure must have lower density material in the line of sight of those regions and therefore the best structure to reproduce the observed projected morphology is an open ended structure or hour - glass shape , which we therefore adopt for this object .",
    "it is also clear from the images in many narrow band filters that the material is highly clumpy , so to reproduce this we include random density fluctuations in the adopted structure .",
    "the final adopted structure in its best fitting orientation on the sky is presented in figure[strut6781 ] .    ]",
    "we present here the main results obtained from the photoionization model constrained by the observational data .",
    "the integrated fluxes for 12 emission lines are given in table[mod - res ] , as well as the fitted abundances and ionizing star parameters .",
    "the model fitting procedure which uses the model image size fitted to the observed one for the line [ nii]658.4 nm , as well as the absolute @xmath14 flux , and the integrated fluxes of all other lines gives a distance of 950@xmath0145pc for ngc6781 .",
