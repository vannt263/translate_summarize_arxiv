    "one of the surprising results of the many deep _ chandra _  _ x - ray observatory _ observations of clusters of galaxies has been growing evidence for higher surface densities of point sources toward clusters of galaxies relative to blank field observations .",
    "early evidence for this excess point source density was found with measurements of cumulative source counts relative to the expectations from deep , blank field exposures @xcite . while the natural interpretation of these sources was that they are associated with the clusters , most of these sources were sufficiently bright that they would have to be active galactic nuclei ( agn ) if they were cluster members .",
    "this conclusion was unexpected because agn , or any emission - line galaxies , are rarely identified in clusters . in a study of elliptical galaxies",
    ", @xcite noted that [ ]  emission was only observed from isolated ellipticals or those in small groups and not from any of the 25 members of rich clusters that were observed .",
    "@xcite significantly improved the statistical significance of this result with a survey of over 1300 galaxies .",
    "he found that the decrease in the number of emission - line galaxies in clusters was true of lenticular and spiral galaxies , as well as ellipticals , and presented the first tentative evidence that agn may be found less commonly in rich clusters than the field .",
    "this result was confirmed with a subsequent , more uniformly - selected spectroscopic survey of 1095 cluster galaxies and 173 field galaxies by @xcite .",
    "these authors found that 7% of cluster galaxies have emission - line nuclei , compared to 31% of field galaxies .",
    "agn were similarly found to be about a factor of five times more rare in clusters : only 1% of cluster galaxies were agn compared to 5% of the field sample .",
    "the smaller agn population in rich clusters relative to the field has been ascribed to differences in the frequency of agn fueling episodes and the smaller numbers of cluster galaxies with significant reservoirs of cold gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most popular mechanisms for fueling agn is the merger of two gas - rich galaxies as the strong gravitational torques from a major merger could provide sufficient gas inflow to the central , supermassive black hole to produce an agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the high velocity dispersions of rich clusters results in a low merger frequency because the galaxies relative velocities are too high to form bound pairs . if galaxy mergers and significant reservoirs of cold gas are the most important parameters for fueling agn , these arguments provide a natural explanation for the lower agn fraction in clusters compared to the field .",
    "these differences in the galaxy population between rich and poor environments suggest that cluster agn are a valuable probe of agn and galaxy evolution . in @xcite",
    ", we measured redshifts for all of the x - ray sources with bright visible - wavelength counterparts in the field of the @xmath10 cluster abell  2104 .",
    "this work confirmed for the first time that many of the x - ray point sources were in fact cluster members and demonstrated that there may be a sufficiently large agn population in clusters of galaxies for demographic studies .",
    "particularly , we found six x - ray sources associated with cluster members , or approximately 5% of all of the luminous cluster galaxies . since the @xcite study , several other groups have carried out x - ray studies of clusters with either new spectroscopic observations or data obtained from the literature .",
    "these observations include the identification of two galaxies in the @xmath11 cluster ms1054 - 0321 @xcite , eight in the @xmath12 cluster abell  2255 @xcite , six galaxies in the @xmath13 cluster abell  3128 @xcite , a recent study of the coma cluster @xcite , and one in the @xmath14 cluster ms2053 - 04 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission from many of these galaxies appears to be due to agn based on their x - ray luminosity and/or x - ray spectral shape .",
    "the two sources in ms1054 - 0321 and the brightest cluster galaxy in ms2053 - 04 have @xmath15 erg s@xmath3 although only a small fraction of the lower - redshift x - ray sources have such high luminosities . for these cases it is possible that the x - ray emission is due to either low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) or halos of hot gas .",
    "several recent visible - wavelength @xcite and radio surveys @xcite have also identified agn in clusters of galaxies and studied the environmental dependence of agn .",
    "new studies of _ chandra _  observations of larger samples of additional clusters have identified more examples of x - ray source overdensities @xcite , although this is not true of every study @xcite .",
    "the largest of these studies to date is the investigation by @xcite of the fields of 51 massive clusters from the macs sample @xcite .",
    "these authors measured significant x - ray source overdensities within 3.5  mpc of the cluster cores , and in particular a high concentration of sources within the central 0.5  mpc .",
    "if the x - ray sources in the moderate to high - redshift clusters studied by @xcite and @xcite are associated with cluster galaxies , their high inferred luminosities makes them very strong agn candidates .    at progressively lower x - ray luminosities ,",
    "an agn classification based on x - ray luminosity alone becomes less secure because populations of lmxbs , hot gaseous halos , and massive starbursts also produce significant x - ray emission .",
    "redshift surveys of galaxies detected in deep x - ray observations have not always detected agn spectral signatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite ascribed the absence of clear agn signatures from even relatively low - redshift ( @xmath16 ) cluster x - ray sources to a combination of dilution by host galaxy starlight and obscuration by gas and dust . in the absence of clear agn spectral signatures ,",
    "multiwavelength spectral shape is the clearest indicator of the physical origin of the x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray and visible - wavelength properties of resolved lmxb populations have now been carefully measured with _",
    "chandra _  for a large number of nearby , luminous elliptical galaxies @xcite and have been observed to produce broad band ( 0.38 kev ) x - ray luminosities as high as @xmath17 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "galaxies with x - ray emission from lmxbs follow a fairly tight relation between @xmath18band and x - ray flux because the number of lmxbs approximately scales with the stellar mass of the host galaxy .",
    "hot gaseous halos from large , early - type galaxies can also produce significant x - ray emission . while the intracluster medium may strip these halos , sources with soft x - ray luminosities of @xmath19 erg s@xmath3",
    "have been observed in many nearby clusters with _",
    "chandra _   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is also a relation between x - ray and stellar luminosity for emission from hot gas , although with larger scatter @xcite and the larger scatter is likely due to environmental influences @xcite .",
    "finally , the most powerful , local starburst galaxies such as arp  220 and ngc  3256 can have x - ray luminosities as high as @xmath20 erg s@xmath3  due to hot gas associated with the starburst @xcite , although these galaxies also have luminous , visible - wavelength emission lines and are expected to be rare in rich clusters .",
    "in addition to their multiwavelength properties , resolution is another discriminant between lmxbs , hot gas , star formation , and agn .",
    "the first three mechanisms will all produce extended x - ray emission and should be resolved in _",
    "_  observations of low - redshift clusters .    since our initial work on abell  2104",
    ", we have completed a spectroscopic study of seven additional , low - redshift ( @xmath21 ) clusters of galaxies .",
    "we have measured redshifts for the visible - wavelength counterparts of all of the x - ray sources in the fields of these clusters more luminous than approximately one magnitude fainter than @xmath22 and identified a total of 40 x - ray sources in eight clusters . in this paper",
    "we describe their multiwavelength properties , conclude that most of these sources must be low - luminosity agn , and demonstrate how the x - ray sources in these clusters can account for the excess point source surface densities .",
    "the observations and data analysis are described next in  [ sec : obs ] , while their multiwavelength properties are analyzed in section ",
    "[ sec : res ] .",
    "the results of this study , in particular the nature of the x - ray emission , calculation of the agn fraction , and implications for the x - ray source overdensities observed toward clusters are discussed in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we summarize this work in the last section . in future papers",
    "we will investigate the relationship of these x - ray sources to the cluster galaxy population and perform a detailed sensitivity analysis to derive the x - ray luminosity function in clusters of galaxies .",

    "for example , the 95% encircled energy at 1.5 kev corresponds to the 92% encircled energy at 3.5 kev . we do not use the 95% encircled energy aperture at 3.5 kev because it would increase the potential for source overlap .",

    "these differences are particularly acute between the front - illuminated ( fi ) acis - i ( ccds 0 through 3 ) and the back - illuminated ( bi ) acis - s ( ccds 5 and 7 ) and consequently we have calculated the conversion between x - ray colors and spectral properties for the acis - i and acis - s observations separately .",
    "the primary cause of this difference is that the bi chips are more sensitive to very soft x - ray photons ( @xmath82 kev ) and therefore a given source will , for example , register a larger @xmath45 count rate if observed with a bi chip relative to an fi chip .",

    "in a recent paper , @xcite argued that this traditional approach of using x - ray colors in predetermined bands is strongly biased toward particular values of @xmath59 and @xmath89 ( for an assumed power - law model ) .",
    "these authors show that the bands used to define the colors used in figure  [ fig : xccd ] can classify sources with @xmath87 and modest absorption with only a few counts , while there will be substantial uncertainties in the classification of substantially softer , harder , and/or more obscured sources .",
    "effectively , a source with higher or lower @xmath59 must be detected with substantially higher counts in order to fall in much of the traditional x - ray color space .",
    "the common adoption of an unobscured @xmath58 power - law for typical x - ray sources may therefore be the result of selection effects due to the band definitions , rather than a reflection of the ubiquity and appropriateness of this model for faint x - ray sources . in figure",
    "[ fig : xq ] we plot the x - ray quantiles defined in section  [ sec : xdata ] along with the same grids of @xmath59 and @xmath89 shown in figure  [ fig : xccd ] ( the approximate axes of @xmath59 and @xmath89 are rotated by @xmath90 degrees ) . as in figure",
    "[ fig : xccd ] , most of the sources are concentrated at low @xmath89 and @xmath87 , although there are many more very soft sources ( large @xmath59 ) and several more hard sources than is apparent from the x - ray colors . as in the previous figure ,",
    "the most significant outliers include the spectroscopically - confirmed agn .",
    "this confirms our conclusion based on figure  [ fig : xccd ] that a simple , absorbed power - law model is not a good fit to even the obvious low - luminosity agn , although more counts would be required to explore a wider parameter space of models .",
    "taken separately , the previous two sections present an apparent contradiction : from the visible - wavelength data alone , it appears that only four of these 40 x - ray sources are agn and the remainder are galaxies with modest star formation or passively - evolving galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray data indicate that most of these sources are quite luminous in x - rays and many are consistent with the unobscured , @xmath91 power laws typical of agn .",
    "furthermore , the spectroscopically - identified agn are those least consistent with unobscured , @xmath91 power law emission . here",
    "we investigate the visible to x - ray properties of these sources in order to resolve this contradiction .",
    "if the x - ray emission from these galaxies is predominantly due to agn and the x - ray to visible - wavelength flux ratio is constant for agn , then the galaxies with agn spectral signatures and bluer colors should be among the most x - ray luminous sources .",
    "we test this hypothesis in figure  [ fig : brlxb ] with a plot of @xmath77 vs.  broad band x - ray luminosity .",
    "this figure shows that only one spectroscopically identifiable agn is among the most x - ray luminous galaxies .",
    "most of the x - ray sources with @xmath15 erg s@xmath3  do not show agn spectral signatures , although we note that all of these galaxies are above @xmath92 and such signatures are more easily diluted by host galaxy starlight .",
    "these galaxies are generally not significantly bluer than other galaxies in these clusters , although some would be classified as butcher - oemler galaxies @xcite .",
    "the visible  x - ray flux ratio can be another indicator of the presence of an agn , as opposed to lmxbs or hot gas , because agn have higher @xmath93 compared to other galaxies . in figure",

    "the region to the right of the dashed vertical line at @xmath94 and bluer than @xmath95 is their locus for blue quasars .",
    "sources with redder @xmath77 colors still have excess x - ray emission over that expected for hot x - ray halos or lmxbs and may therefore be obscured agn .",
    "the very red a2104 - 1 is an excellent example of an obscured agn with red visible - wavelength colors and excess x - ray emission .",
    "the other extreme source in this figure ( at @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) is the poststarburst galaxy ac114 - 1 , which has an extremely soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "less than a third of our sample is located in their quasar regime defined by @xmath94 and @xmath98 in figure  [ fig : brmrfxfr ] , although this is not surprising as none of these x - ray sources have quasar luminosities ( @xmath99 erg s@xmath3 ) and therefore the @xmath69band flux could include a contribution from stars .",
    "in fact nearly all of our spectra are dominated by host galaxy starlight .",
    "we investigate the @xmath100 ratio as a function of @xmath75 in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : brmrfxfr ] in order to determine the typical host galaxy luminosity of sources with large @xmath100 .",
    "this figure demonstrates that most of the sources with large @xmath100 are in approximately @xmath101 or fainter galaxies and are above @xmath102 .",
    "the absence of low - luminosity galaxies with small @xmath100 is due to the sensitivity limit of the x - ray observations . while our spectroscopic observations are complete to @xmath103 mag , the x - ray observations are only sensitive to galaxies with small @xmath100 in these clusters if they have luminous host galaxies . in contrast",
    ", the increasing number of luminous galaxies with lower @xmath100 is significant .",
    "for luminous galaxies this illustrates that they are more likely to host a faint x - ray source than a bright one .    unlike the case for low - luminosity agn , there is a relatively tight relation between x - ray and visible - wavelength flux for galaxies with x - ray emission due to lmxbs @xcite .",

    "this figure shows that all of these galaxies are more x - ray luminous than would be expected from lmxb emission alone , although several galaxies are marginally consistent with the lmxb relation .",
    "x - ray emission from the hot interstellar medium in early - type galaxies may also make a significant contribution to the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "the x - ray spectra of hot gas emission should be substantially softer than agn emission , however most of the x - ray sources lack sufficient counts to use this as a discriminant .",
    "instead , we compare these sources to the @xmath109 relation observed for local early - type galaxies @xcite . figure  [ fig : lxlb2 ] shows soft x - ray luminosity vs.  @xmath110 for our sample along with the literature relation from @xcite and several measurements of early - type galaxies in abell  1367 with _ chandra _  from @xcite .",
    "the measurements of early - type in abell  1367 galaxies are a particularly relevant comparison sample because the @xmath93 ratio is generally larger for galaxies in rich environments , provided the environments are not so rich and the galaxies have such high relative velocities that ram pressure stripping is significant @xcite .",
    "all of our sources have at least seven counts in the broad ( 0.3 - 8 kev ) x - ray band .",
    "seven counts correspond to broad band x - ray luminosities ranging from @xmath62 erg s@xmath3(a644 ) to @xmath64 erg s@xmath3(a1689 ) for an unobscured @xmath58 power law and galactic absorption .",
    "when we combine the x - ray sensitivity with our spectroscopic completeness , we can conservatively state that we are sensitive to all x - ray sources more luminous than @xmath111 erg s@xmath3and host galaxies with @xmath9 mag in these eight clusters , although we are sensitive to substantially less x - ray luminous galaxies in most of the clusters .",
    "only four x - ray sources in our sample ( a644 - 1 , a2104 - 1 , a1689 - 2 , a2163 - 1 ) are both x - ray luminous @xmath15 erg s@xmath3  and exhibit the emission - line signatures of agn .",
    "ten additional galaxies are above @xmath111 erg s@xmath3   and therefore are most likely agn , but at progressively fainter x - ray luminosities an increasing number of physical mechanisms can produce luminous x - ray emission , particularly a population of lmxbs , thermal emission from a hot , gaseous halo , and star formation . of these three mechanisms ,",

    "while the less luminous sources lack sufficient counts for detailed spectral fitting , most with at least moderate signal - to - noise ratio x - ray detections are consistent with a @xmath58 power law ( see figures  [ fig : xccd ] and [ fig : xq ] ) .",
    "the sources with softer x - ray spectra could be due to thermal bremsstrahlung or may be compton - thick agn .",

    "if we conservatively assume the other two sources are not agn , along with the three mentioned previously that are statistically consistent with the lmxb or hot gas @xmath109 relation , we conclude that at least 35 of these 40 x - ray sources are agn .",
    "we calculate the fraction @xmath4 of cluster galaxies that host agn by dividing the number of cluster agn @xmath112 by an estimate of the total number of cluster members @xmath113 to our absolute - magnitude spectroscopic limit @xmath75 within the field of the _ chandra _  observation . along with our spectroscopic survey of x - ray sources",
    ", we also obtained spectra of many candidate cluster members to measure the cluster velocity dispersion and more generally characterize the cluster galaxy population .",
    "we first calculate the fraction @xmath114 of all ( non x - ray ) spectroscopic targets to some magnitude limit that are cluster members",
    ". then the total number of cluster galaxies to this magnitude limit is @xmath115 , the magnitude limit corresponds to the same @xmath75 for all clusters , and @xmath116 is the total galaxy population to this magnitude limit .",
    "the cluster agn fraction is then @xmath117 .",
    "we estimated the total number of galaxies in each cluster to a uniform absolute magnitude of @xmath6 mag , which was set by the spectroscopic completeness of our observations of the more distant clusters .",
    "our success rate at identifying cluster members varied from 19 to 44% based on spectroscopic redshifts for between 12 and 54 cluster members not targeted as x - ray sources .",
    "these calculations yield an x - ray source fraction of @xmath118% for the seven new clusters and confirms our previous result based on just one cluster @xcite .",
    "the six cluster members fainter than @xmath6 mag in table  [ tbl : lum ] are not included in this calculation .",
    "the agn fraction is more meaningfully compared to other surveys with a constraint on agn luminosity in addition to galaxy stellar luminosity .",
    "we use the x - ray sensitivity of our observations to constrain the agn fraction to be the fraction of agn above a broad - band x - ray luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "nearly all of these x - ray observations would detect an x - ray source more luminous than this and all but four of our 40 x - ray sources are above this luminosity .",
    "the four sources eliminated by this luminosity cut include all but one of those least likely to be agn based on x - ray to visible - wavelength flux ratio .",
    "we find that the fraction of galaxies brighter than @xmath6 mag that host agn more luminous than @xmath7 erg s@xmath3  is @xmath119 mag@xmath120erg s@xmath3@xmath121% .",
    "the quoted uncertainty corresponds to 90% one - sided confidence limits calculated from poisson statistics @xcite .",
    "we may have underestimated the true agn fraction because our x - ray sensitivity is a factor of five above @xmath7 erg s@xmath3  for two clusters ( a1689 and ms1008 ) and therefore these clusters may contain additional agn below our x - ray limit and more luminous than @xmath17 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the advantage of this lower luminosity limit is that it maximizes the number of x - ray sources in cluster members and the statistical significance of the detection .",
    "while there are only a small number of agn per cluster , we do find evidence for substantial variation in the agn fraction from cluster to cluster , most notably a substantially higher agn fraction in abell 3128 relative to abell 644 , even though the abell 644 x - ray observations are more sensitive .",
    "we plan to explore this aspect of our data in a future paper ( martini et al .  2006 , _ in prep _",
    ") that will include a more detailed completeness study .",
    "we note uncertainties in the present completeness calculation may introduce systematic errors in the agn fraction that are larger than the statistical errors .",
    "the agn fraction we find in clusters is approximately a factor of five times higher than the visible - wavelength spectroscopic survey of @xcite , who found a @xmath122% agn fraction ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". however , when we just calculate the cluster agn fraction from those identified in visible - wavelength spectroscopy , our results are completely consistent with the @xcite result .",
    "this has some interesting implications for the field agn fraction , which these authors found was approximately five times higher than the cluster fraction .",
    "if the properties of cluster and field agn are similar , then there are simply five times fewer agn in clusters .",
    "a survey with similar selection criteria to this one should then identify a field agn fraction of @xmath123% .",
    "we can also use these data to address the origin of the apparent excess of x - ray sources observed toward the fields of other clusters observed by _",
    "chandra_. the excesses take the form of overdensities in the log n ",
    "log s relation and have been reported in the soft @xcite and hard x - ray bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although not for all cluster fields @xcite .",
    "our redshift measurements allow us to directly address whether or not the x - ray sources in these eight clusters add appreciably to the x - ray surface density .",
    "we address this question on a cluster by cluster basis by measuring the flux - limited fraction of sources that are members of a given cluster . for each of our fields",
    ", we have counted the number of sources brighter than some limiting soft x - ray flux and calculated the fraction of these sources that are cluster members .",
    "this effectively integrates log n  log s for the field to the flux limit of the observation , where we have adopted a flux limit corresponding to five counts in the soft x - ray band at the aimpoint and adopted a model with @xmath58 and only galactic absorption .",
    "the five count soft - band threshold was chosen because it is comparable in signal - to - noise ratio to our seven count broad - band threshold .",
    "this threshold includes all but one of our cluster sources ( ms1008 - 1 ) .",
    "we find that the cluster x - ray sources contribute up to 20% of the soft x - ray point source density in these fields .",
    "for each field we use poisson statistics @xcite to calculate the one - sided confidence limits from the number of nonmembers . for three of these eight clusters ,",
    "the point sources due to cluster members constitute a @xmath124 excess , and are slightly more significant for a fourth ( a3128 ) .",
    "these marginally significant excesses are similar to the results toward cluster fields without membership information , particularly the @xcite study that identified an @xmath125 excess surface density from a sample of 51 clusters .",
    "two differences between our data and their macs sample are that the later data have a shallower luminosity threshold and encompass a larger fraction of the total cluster size because the macs clusters tend to be at higher redshift .",
    "the absence of an overdensity of x - ray sources in the @xcite study , in contrast , may be due to their preference for clusters whose intracluster medium subtends only a small fraction ( less than 10% ) of the field @xcite with the result that their sample of 29 cluster fields is dominated by high - redshift clusters .",
    "only the most luminous cluster members could therefore be detected in these images .",
    "in addition , as @xcite note , their cluster fields were mostly obtained with acis - i and any cluster signal may also be diluted by field contamination due to the large field of view .",
    "the redshift range and various sensitivity limits of these eight clusters can be used to explore the importance of these quantities in detecting x - ray source excesses in other cluster fields . in the top panels of figure  [ fig : logns ]",
    "we show that there are no obvious trends with either flux limit or redshift , in spite of the approximately factor of ten variation in sensitivity",
    ". this lack of variation may be due in part to the fact that the more distant cluster observations were chosen to be more sensitive and therefore the observations have a narrower range in luminosity sensitivity than flux sensitivity , although this could be offset by higher field contamination at fainter flux limits .",
    "indeed three of the four clusters with marginally - significant excesses , which correspond to those with greater than 10% cluster contributions , are at @xmath66 .",
    "we note that we are neglecting the fact that the flux limit will rise with increasing off - axis angle because both the cluster and field x - ray sources will experience the same effect , although could nevertheless be a bias toward a higher cluster fraction if the cluster sources are more centrally concentrated within the acis field of view .",
    "the radial distribution of cluster sources is also important because the fixed angular size of the _ chandra _  observations subtends a substantially smaller fraction of a given cluster at lower - redshift .",
    "for example , the approximately @xmath126 wide acis - i field of view corresponds to only 1.2  mpc at @xmath13 , but over 4.5  mpc at @xmath127 .",
    "we have investigated the importance of aperture size by calculating the fraction of cluster x - ray sources within a fixed physical radius of 0.5  mpc for all eight clusters .",
    "this physical aperture size is the largest that is contained within the _ chandra _  images of all eight clusters , particularly the two lowest - redshift clusters , and also happens to be the physical radius within which @xcite observed the most significant overdensity of x - ray sources . within this aperture size",
    "we now measure fractions as high as @xmath128% for one cluster ( ac114 ) , although we still measure @xmath129% or less for most ( six clusters ; all but ms1008 and ac114 ) the fractional contribution of sources within 0.5  mpc as a function of limiting soft x - ray flux and redshift are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : logns ] . if we now repeat the same experiment described above to determine if the cluster members make a statistically - significant contribution to the surface density within an 0.5  mpc aperture , the cluster x - ray sources in a3128 and ac114 are @xmath130 excesses over the number of other x - ray sources , while ms1008 sources make only a marginal contribution .",
    "we note that the @xmath125 excess noted by @xcite in their sample of 51 clusters is consistent with a @xmath124 excess per cluster summed in over their sample .",
    "while the fraction of cluster members does appear highest for the two highest - redshift clusters , the present sample of clusters is too small for us to claim the presence of redshift dependence in the cluster agn population .",
    "we have completed a redshift survey and multiwavelength study of x - ray sources in the fields of eight clusters of galaxies and discovered luminous x - ray emission from 40 galaxies .",
    "emission - lines , x - ray spectral properties , and x - ray to visible - wavelength flux ratios were used to determine that the vast majority of these sources are low - luminosity agn .",
    "we conservatively estimate that at least 35 of these 40 sources are agn in the clusters and estimate that the agn fraction in clusters is @xmath8% , that is @xmath5% of all cluster galaxies more luminous than @xmath6 mag host agn with broad - band x - ray luminosities greater than @xmath7 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "only a small fraction of these galaxies would be classified as agn from their visible - wavelength spectra . in most instances",
    "the agn identification is due to x - ray spectral shape or x - ray to visible - wavelength flux ratios . in particular , the multiwavelength properties of these sources are used to show that they are more x - ray luminous for their observed b - band luminosity than would be expected for either a population of lmxbs or hot , gaseous halos that have survived in the intracluster medium .",
    "the x - ray sources in these clusters do not make a statistically significant contribution to the surface density in any one of these _ chandra _   observations , although summation of a sufficient number of similar clusters would produce a statistically significant excess similar to those observed in stacked _ chandra _  observations of other cluster fields .",
    "we therefore conclude there is a sufficiently large population of x - ray sources in clusters of galaxies to explain the observed point source excess .",
    "this population of cluster agn is a factor of five higher than expected from previous spectroscopic surveys .",
    "we attribute our higher success rate to the fact that optical searches for agn are strongly biased against detection of low - luminosity agn because of host galaxy dilution and obscuration .",
    "agn with yet lower x - ray luminosities are likely present in other luminous cluster galaxies , or equivalently the agn fraction should increase with a lower @xmath106 threshold , although they may prove difficult to discriminate from emission due to lmxbs or hot gas in the absence of substantially higher signal - to - noise ratio data .",
    "our result also has interesting implications for a higher field agn fraction .",
    "if the agn fraction in the field is five times the cluster agn fraction , as found by dressler and collaborators for uniformly - selected samples of field and cluster galaxies , then similar selection criteria to this study will identify a field agn fraction of @xmath123% .",
    "the substantial number of cluster galaxies hosting agn suggests that cluster galaxies can retain significant reservoirs of cold gas near their central , supermassive black holes .",
    "these agn , and others currently dormant , may have significantly contributed to heating the intracluster medium and driving galaxy evolution via feedback processes at higher redshift .",
    "future observations of agn and measurements of the agn fraction in higher - redshift clusters may provide valuable new insights into cluster assembly and galaxy evolution in clusters .",
