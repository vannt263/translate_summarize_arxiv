    "second , assume now that @xmath282 lie on the circle @xmath243 , and @xmath283",
    ". then @xmath278 could be increased by moving @xmath13 on the circle and further from @xmath279 ( to the midpoint of the arc ) .",
    "this again would contradict the maximality of @xmath73 , hence all sides of @xmath73 are equal . since @xmath2 is odd , it is obvious that the common edge length is strictly smaller than @xmath48 , since otherwise @xmath284 can not coincide with @xmath10 .",
    "having established the two properties above , we can now easily obtain an upper bound on the perimeter of @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath160 be the center of @xmath63 .",
    "for each @xmath92 $ ] , label the side @xmath165 by @xmath285 or @xmath286 depending on whether the center @xmath160 lies on the right of @xmath287 or on the left of @xmath287 .",
    "this labeling encodes the winding of the edges of @xmath73 around the center @xmath160 .",
    "let @xmath83=\\gamma_+ \\cup \\gamma_-$ ] be the corresponding partition of @xmath83 $ ] determined by a positive or , respectively , negative labeling of @xmath288 .",
    "write @xmath289 , and @xmath290 , so @xmath291 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath292 ; indeed if both @xmath293 and @xmath294 , then there exist two consecutive sides , @xmath295 and @xmath165 , one with a positive label and one with a negative label .",
    "this implies that @xmath281 , hence @xmath278 could be increased ( recall that the side length is smaller than @xmath48 ) by moving @xmath13 to the point diametrically opposite to @xmath280 ( and @xmath296 ) , a contradiction .",
    "hence @xmath292 , @xmath297 , and @xmath298 $ ] . for each @xmath92 $ ] , let @xmath299 , where @xmath300 . since @xmath73 is a closed polygonal chain , @xmath301 for some positive integer @xmath302 , @xmath303 .",
    "consequently , the perimeter of @xmath73 is @xmath304 as claimed .",
    "it remains to show that this bound can be attained .",
    "consider @xmath2 points evenly distributed on the unit circle , and labeled from @xmath85 to @xmath2 , say in clockwise order .",
    "the polygon we need is the thrackle which connects the point labeled @xmath138 with the point labeled @xmath305 ( as usually the indexes are taken modulo @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that its perimeter is given by the upper bound in , and this concludes the proof of theorem  [ t6 ] .",
    "note that the sum of the first two terms in this formula , @xmath309 , gives ( in the limit ) the perimeter of a simple polygon whose first two sides have length @xmath310 each , and whose remaining @xmath39 sides go back and forth near a diameter of the unit disk .",
    "thus the perimeter of the extremal polygon in theorem  [ t5 ] exceeds the perimeter of the polygon described above only by a term that tends to zero with @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that ( for odd @xmath2 ) in contrast to @xmath66 , @xmath71 does get arbitrarily close to @xmath62 , as @xmath2 tends to infinity ; that is , @xmath311 . indeed , the series expansion of @xmath312 around @xmath313 , @xmath314 gives @xmath315              c. audet , p. hansen , and f. messine : extremal problems for convex polygons ",
