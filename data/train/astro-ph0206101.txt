    "a large fraction of galactic x - ray and gamma - ray sources is associated with neutron stars , in particular with rotation powered pulsars ( rpp ) .",
    "spectacular results of observational campaigns of rpp with rosat , asca and cgro , and recently with rxte and chandra induced a new wave of interest in theoretical models of pulsar magnetospheric activity .",
    "a challenging aspect of these efforts is that lightcurves and broadband energy spectra of the brightest he sources exhibit unexpected richness of features making thus each object a unique case pending special treatment .",
    "the pair creation paradigm is a pivotal element in virtually all models of magnetospheric activity of radiopulsars ( which at the moment constitute a vast majority of known rpps ) .",
    "electron - positron pairs ( @xmath0-pairs ) are thought to be responsible for radio emission observed in radiopulsars which is interpreted as the coherent curvature radiation of @xmath0 plasma .",
    "pairs can be produced in magnetospheric environments either via photon absorption in a dense field of soft photons ( photon - photon collision ) or via photon absorption in a strong magnetic field . in either case",
    "a supply of hard gamma photons is required in order to fulfill stringent threshold conditions for pair creation .",
    "not all of these photons would be subject to absorption ; many will escape the magnetosphere without any attenuation .",
    "this leads us to expect that all radiopulsars ( including low-@xmath1 millisecond objects ) should be the sources of gamma radiation .",
    "it is up to theoretical models to show whether the expected flux of the radiation is interestingly high with respect to the sensitivity of recent and future gamma - ray telescopes .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that the pair creation paradigm remains just a paradigm for the time being : recently it was questioned by @xcite , who presented arguments that for a wide range of surface temperature , magnetic field strength and spin period , the electrons supplied by neutron star surface via thermionic and field emission will screen out the accelerating electric field @xmath2 , limiting it to a residual value . in consequence ,",
    "no favourable conditions would exist for magnetic pair production .",
    "this review offers our subjective account of how the models of high - energy radiation do perform within the framework of polar - cap models with space - charge - limited - flow ( sclf ) .",
    "first , we introduce all ingredients of polar - cap models with sclf and we describe major characteristics of all radiative processes relevant for physical conditions in pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "then we address successes as well as noticeable disadvantages of these models upon their confrontation with the data .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we recall in this section basic quantities used throughout the review . a neutron star of radius @xmath3 and moment of inertia @xmath4 , spinning with angular velocity @xmath5 which decreases in time ( for whatever the reason ) at a rate @xmath6 , loses its rotational energy at the rate @xmath7 where @xmath8 is in seconds , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and   is the so called spin - down luminosity .",
    "if a magnetic dipole is anchored at the center of a neutron star , with its magnetic moment @xmath11 inclined at angle @xmath12 to the spin axis @xmath13 , then the strength of the field at the stellar equator is @xmath14 ( and twice as high at the poles ) .",
    "the dipole , rotating in a vacuum will lose energy at the rate @xmath15 the quantity @xmath16 can be thus inferred from @xmath8 and @xmath17 for a neutron star with known values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "another model , where the dipolar radiation is replaced with a magnetospheric wind of particles @xcite , gives a similar result as ( [ b3 ] ) for an orthogonal case : @xmath18 and therefore is independent of the angle @xmath12 . since no observational support exists for @xmath17 depending on @xmath19 , the standard approach is to apply the latter model ( @xmath20 ) to derive the strength of the dipolar component of magnetic field @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "it is likely that neutron star magnetic fields contain high - order multipoles which may dominate the dipolar component at the surface level .",
    "their relative amplitudes as well as distribution remain , however , unknown .",
    "it will be assumed throughout the paper that the magnetic field is a static - like dipole , not distorted by rotational effects or by presence of strong outflowing wind of particles ( the latter effect has been recently invoked to decrease very high values of @xmath24 inferred from @xmath8 and @xmath17 for two sgrs @xcite ) .",
    "the field is therefore approximated with axisymmetric field lines satisfying @xmath25 in polar coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with the dipole constant @xmath28 .",
    "a dipole constant for which a rigid rotation with the angular velocity @xmath29 reaches the speed - of - light limit ( it occurs for @xmath30 and this particular value is denoted as @xmath31 ) determines the so called light cylinder of radius @xmath31 .",
    "all field lines which cross the light cylinder are then considered as open lines , and their footpoints on the stellar surface define two polar caps of radius @xmath32 , where the latter factor is the sine function of the magnetic colatitude @xmath33 for the outer rim of the polar cap : @xmath34",
    "for more than 1500 pulsars known to date only about @xmath35 positive detections in x - rays and no more than 10 detections in gamma - rays have been achieved ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "cgro provided seven high - confidence detections ( of _ seven samurai _ ) with three other cases classified as ` likely ' detections .",
    "the gamma - ray sources were identified by virtue of flux pulsations with previously known @xmath8 and @xmath17 .",
    "crab and vela are the only pulsars seen by all three instruments of cgro .",
    "no trace of pulsed signal in vhe range ( 300 gev  30 tev ) has been found so far for the gamma - ray pulsars ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , strong steady vhe emission is associated with 3 out of 10 gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "two plerionic sources of the steady vhe radiation  the crab nebula and the plerion around b1706 - 44  may serve as standard candles , with ` grade a ' according to @xcite . a third plerion  around the vela pulsar  was given ` grade b ' in the same ranking .",

    "a remarkable fact is that the location of x - ray sources does not correlate with the inferred strength of magnetic field @xmath24 ; at least not in a naively anticipated way that high - b objects would emit he radiation , whereas low - b objects would not . in particular , 10 millisecond pulsars  about thirty percent of all millisecond pulsars ( the objects with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , i.e. with low b values : @xmath52 ) known to date  have been detected as x - ray sources .",
    "so far , millisecond pulsars have eluded the detection in gamma rays ( possibly with one exception , see below ) and just upper limits were available for a handful of them from egret observations @xcite . in the case of j0437 - 4715",
    "the upper limit is interestingly tight  in disagreement with the empirical relation @xmath53 ( see fig.[gamma ] ) .",
    "empirical evidence that pulsars must somehow tap their high - energy activity from rotation comes from a strong correlation between the success of detection in x  and/or @xmath54-rays and the position in the lists of targets ranked by spin - down flux values @xmath55 , which is presented in a graphical form in fig .",

    "spectral analysis for pulsars detected with rosat pspc ( @xmath56 to @xmath57 ) shows that in most cases a power - law spectral model provides acceptable fits to the data @xcite .",
    "moreover , an intriguing empirical relation between inferred x - ray luminosity and spin down luminosity was found , @xmath58 , confirming rotational origin of most of the x - ray activity .",
    "an interesting point is that the relation was obtained for all the sources regardless their temporal characteristics ( about 50  % of all pulsars detected with rosat are unpulsed sources ) .",
    "a complementary empirical relation was found for pulsed emission from 19 pulsars observed with asca ( @xmath59 to @xmath60 ) .",
    "assuming opening angle of x - rays to be one steradian , the inferred pulsed x - ray luminosity correlates with spin - down luminosity as @xmath61 according to @xcite .",
    "a similar power - law empirical relation holds for gamma - rays ( cf .",

    "the most efficient conversion of spin - down luminosity into high - energy radiation is taking place for b1055 - 52  the oldest pulsar among _ seven samurai _  with @xmath65 .",
    "high energy lightcurves differ significantly from those in radio .",

    "the peaks in gamma - rays as well as in radio wavelengths occur at the same rotational phases .",
    "the light - curve shapes fall into two categories .",
    "the crab pulsar , vela and geminga show two sharp peaks separated in phase by @xmath66 and connected by an interpeak bridge of considerable level . b1706 - 44 shows two peaks separated by 0.2 in phase , with some hints of a third component in between .",
    "other pulsars exhibit broad single pulses .",
    "unknown opening angles for gamma - ray emission introduce a factor of uncertainty when inferring the gamma - ray luminosities .",
    "broad peaks in gamma - ray pulses do not necessarily mean large opening angles for gamma - ray emission .",

    "a dicovery of sharply peaked pulsed x - ray emission in the fastest millisecond pulsar b1937 + 21 an apparently separate group of millisecond x - ray pulsars emerges , with its members  b1821 - 24 @xcite , j0218 + 4232 @xcite , and b1937 + 21 @xcite  being scaled - down versions of the crab pulsar as far as sharp pulse profiles and hard power - law x - ray spectra are concerned .",
    "an astonishing common feature within the group is the same strength of the magnetic field estimated at the light cylinder and the fact that it matches the strength of the crab pulsar magnetic field at the light cylinder .",
    "it is , however , lightcurves and broadband energy spectra extending from optical to x - rays and to gamma - rays , available for _ seven samurai _ ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) that are particularly impressive and challenging for any models of pulsar activity .",

    "we will concentrate hereafter on a class of models where the supply of charged particles from a neutron star surface along open field lines is not limited by either binding or cohesive energy of the particles and therefore can reach the goldreich  julian rate close to the surface ( ` space charge limited flow '  @xcite , @xcite )",

    "the creation of pairs leads to the screening of the accelerating field @xmath94 within the layer of pff .",

    "vertical structure of the electric field depends ( via the location of pff ) on radiative processes which induce the pair creation : curvature radiation ( cr ) and inverse compton scattering ( ics ) on soft x - ray photons from the stellar surface ( brief characteristics of these processes is presented in the next section ) .",
    "an interesting way to avoid immediate screening of the electric field by created pairs , relevant in strong magnetic fields @xmath112 , was proposed by @xcite who noticed that pairs are created then near the energy threshold , most favourably in bound states  as atoms of positronium  which then move to high altitudes before being ionized .",
    "cooling of ultrarelativistic electrons via curvature radiation ( cr ) and magnetic inverse compton scattering ( ics ) are the most natural ways of producing hard gamma - rays capable of inducing cascades of @xmath0-pairs and secondary he photons .",
    "these two processes dominate within two distinct ranges of lorentz factors @xmath54 of primary electrons .    when @xmath113 , magnetic inverse compton scattering plays a dominant role in braking the electrons and it is the main source of hard gamma - ray photons @xcite .",

    "the lorentz factors can then be limited even to @xmath116 .",
    "this stopping effect becomes more efficient for stronger magnetic fields , and it was suggested as an explanation for the observed cutoff at @xmath117 in the spectrum of b1509 - 58 @xcite .",
    "ics was also found to be able ( under some circumstances ) to smear out the monotonic energy distribution of electrons significantly , with interesting consequences for the cascades @xcite .",
    "however , in their modern versions the accelerators of particles are strong enough to outpower the ics cooling . in consequence ,",
    "very high lorentz factors  @xmath118  are achieved by electrons , limited by cr .",
    "the first detailed scenario of radiative processes in cr - induced cascades was presented by @xcite and despite many modifications and additions its basic features remain valid .",
    "the model assumes that primary electrons accelerated to ultrarelativistic energies emit curvature photons which in turn are absorbed by the magnetic field and @xmath0-pairs are created .",
    "these pairs cool off instantly via synchrotron radiation process . whenever the sr photons are energetic enough they may lead to further creation of pairs , etc .",
    "ics can still be incorporated to the models with cr - induced cascades as the process relevant for @xmath0-pairs , since typical lorentz factors of theirs do not exceed @xmath116 . according to the analytical model of @xcite the empirical relations for x - ray and gamma - ray luminosities of pulsars ( presented in sect.3 )",
    "can be reproduced satisfactorily when the ics involving @xmath0-pairs is included .",
    "processes relevant for generation and transfer of high - energy photons in pulsar magnetospheres are therefore : + - curvature radiation , + - magnetic inverse compton scattering , + - magnetic pair creation ( @xmath119 ) + - synchrotron radiation , + - photon splitting ( @xmath120 , ) + - photon - photon pair creation ( @xmath121 ) .",

    "generally , it becomes competitive to the magnetic pair creation for dipolar magnetospheres with @xmath229 @xcite .",
    "the degradation of photon energy in the course of splitting inhibits also any development electromagnetic cascades . in consequence , high-@xmath1 rpp should not emit coherent radio emission .",

    "@xcite are located above the formal limiting line derived in @xcite ( and elaborated in @xcite ) , the general argument that magnetars are expected to be radio - quiet rpp remains valid @xcite .",

    "the same problem was encountered by @xcite when modelling the cgro data points of vela .",
    "physical justification for lifting the accelerator up to @xmath231 might rely on a mechanism proposed by @xcite .",
    "they considered a sandwich - like structure of two pair formation fronts ( pff ) , controlled by either cr or ics , where the lower pff would be formed due to positrons returning from the upper pff . with reasonable surface temperatures ( @xmath232 )",
    "it is ics which dominates ( comparing to cr ) in generating high - energy quanta at the energetic expense of upward moving electrons and downward moving positrons .",
    "such a situation is not symmetrical and not stable , therefore .",
    "accordingly , the lower pff tends to elevate until the cr - cooling takes over , which happens at @xmath233 .",
    "unfortunately , this mechanism  rather promising in the context of required @xmath230 , even though @xmath234 is still notably more than @xmath235  has been invalidated by recent numerical calculations : @xcite concluded the inability of ics - controlled upper pffs to develope lower pffs because of too low multiplicities in such cases .",
    "the requirement of high - altitude accelerator for vela is likely to be extended to other gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "a piece of hint for such a requirement comes from a strong correlation for known gamma - ray pulsars between the inferred magnetic field strength and the value of high - energy cutoff @xcite .",
    "[ _ note , that this empirical correlation speaks in favor of high - energy cutoffs in pulsar spectra originating due to magnetic absorption of gamma - rays  a signature of polar - cap models_. ] this is shown in fig.[baring ] along with the dependence of @xmath236 on the location of photon emission point @xmath26 according to eq.([cutoff1 ] ) .",
    "last but not least  a real challenge for all contemporary models for vela comes from the phase - resolved spectral analysis of pulsed hard x - rays and the phasing of the lightcurves in optical , x - rays and gamma - rays , presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the strong double - peak lightcurve in optical ( fig.1 in these refs . ) is particularly enigmatic .",
    "the peak - to - peak separation is notably smaller than in he domain .",
    "moreover , the leading peak has no counterpart in any other energy range ( including the radio ) .",
    "the trailing optical peak seems to be associated with the trailing rxte peak and with the trailing gamma - ray peak , though the latter lags behind the trailing optical by about @xmath237 in phase .",
    "extrapolation of the gamma - ray spectrum taken for either of the two gamma - ray peaks falls below the phase - averaged optical flux level ( by a factor @xmath238 in the case of the trailing gamma - ray peak ) .",
    "the problem of optical emission is also difficult to solve in the framework of our phase - averaged approach to model the spectrum of vela .",
    "a difficult task we have faced was to find a component ( without referring to any ingredients external to the model ) that would account for the optical emission , at least in some particular circumstances .",
    "fig.[vela2 ] gives an example of what can be achieved at best in the optical domain of the model spectrum , but at the price paid at the high - energy end of the spectrum .    .",

    "if these estimates are correct then some millisecond pulsars , including j0437 - 4715 ( see fig.[j0437 ] ) , should be detected with next - generation experiments , providing thus a testing ground for magnetospheric models relevant for millisecond pulsars .",

    "the shape of the apparent cut - off can easily mimic very soft spectra ( @xcite used similar viewing geometry arguments to explain very soft spectra of egret uid sources ) .",

    "viewing geometry has been recognized as an important factor in shaping the lightcurves as well as broadband energy spectra of particular objects ( like e.g. the vela pulsar , see @xcite ) as well as in the context of egret uid galactic sources ( e.g. recent review by @xcite ) .",

    "the lightcurves ( these are energy - integrated above @xmath265mev ) and the gamma - ray spectra were calculated with our numerical code .",

    "the millisecond gamma - ray pulsar j0218 + 4232 ( fig.[j0218 ] ) is probably a good example of such a case .",
    "high - energy astrophysics of pulsars was challenged by unexpected richness of spectral and temporal properties found for the brightest gamma - ray pulsars . numerous modifications ( both , minor and major ) to the existing models of magnetospheric activity are being invented to accommodate at least some of these properties .",

    "its advanced technology will make possible to cover energy range between 10  gev and 1  tev , and to reach @xmath266tev in the large zenith angle mode .",
    "energy ranges of glast and magic will overlap over more than one decade in energy .",
    "we expect that the question of whether millisecond pulsars emit gamma - rays at all , will be answered relatively easily with these high - sensitivity observatories , verifying at first the status of j0218@xmath2484232 .",
    "+ in the context of numerous positive detections anticipated at hard gamma - rays , inclusion of viewing geometry effects will be of particular importance to properly interpret the observed shapes of spectral turnovers at high - energy ends .    to tackle high - quality data of the future in the most effective way",
    ", numerical 3d codes should be developed , capable of fast tracing the development and propagation of electromagnetic cascades in variety of non - dipolar realizations of magnetic field structure .",
    "relaxing the centered - dipole assumption as a first step would be very much in line with recent conclusions from the soft x - ray data analysis for neutron stars ( pavlov et  al .",
    "optical to gamma - ray properties of vela ( section  [ problems ] ) are in our opinion a signature of a strongly non - axisymmetric hollow cone of radiation around the magnetic axis .",
    "strong deviations of the actual magnetic field structure from a pure dipole at the stellar surface may well be responsible for inducing this axial asymmetry already at the site of electron acceleration .",

    "<S> spectacular results of pulsar observations in x - ray and gamma - ray domains gave a new boost to theoretical models of pulsar magnetospheric activity . </S>",
    "<S> a challenging aspect of these efforts is that lightcurves and broadband energy spectra of the brightest he sources exhibit unexpected richness of features , making each object almost a unique case to be interpreted with a custom - made model . </S>",
    "<S> this review offers our subjective account of how the models of high - energy radiation used within the framework of sclf polar - cap scenarios tackle with these challenges . we describe major characteristics of all radiative processes relevant for modeling the observed features . </S>",
    "<S> then we address successes as well as noticeable disadvantages of these models upon their confrontation with the available data . </S>"
