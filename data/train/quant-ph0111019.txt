    "a critical requirements for holonomies is that the eigenspace should be preserved throughout the adiabatic change of parameters , which is typically fulfilled by symmetry  @xcite .",

    "so far we have discussed fundamental requirements for geometric manipulations in idealized systems . in this section",
    ", we discuss several situations one may come up with when attempting an experimental realization of the present scheme .",
    "first of all , the present scheme is based on the adiabatic theorem  @xcite .",
    "ideally the change in the control parameters should be infinitely slow . at a finite rate of change",
    ", there can be a transition out of the computational subspace .",
    "however , typically such a landau - zener - type transition occurs with an exponentially small probability @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the smallest energy gap between the computational subspace and the nearby energy levels and @xmath144 is the adiabaticity parameter ( i.e. , @xmath145 )  @xcite . in",
    "josephson networks the level distance is of order of the josephson coupling energy , @xmath146 . for an operation time",
    "@xmath147 , @xmath148 .",
    "( for comparison , in a recent experiment concerning dynamic quantum computation on josephson qubits  @xcite , the switching time was no shorter than @xmath149 . )    in the previous section , on each superconducting box we neglected higher charge states other than the two lowest .",
    "in dynamic quantum computation schemes , the existence of those higher levels may cause the quantum leakage errors , i.e. , it leads to a nonzero probability of leakage out of the computational space , and more severely to renormalization of the energy levels in the computational space ( which therefore reduces the gate fidelity )  @xcite . in josephson qubits , however , the coupling to the higher charge states are only through the josephson tunneling of cooper pairs , which can be easily included in our considerations [ see eqs .",
    "( [ holonomic : prototype ] ) , ( [ holonomic : h3 ] ) , ( [ holonomic : h4 ] ) , and ( [ holonomic : h5 ] ) ] .",
    "those higher charge states form well - separated energy levels , and do not alter the degenerate structure of the subspace in question , at least up to the order of @xmath150 [ in the dynamic scheme the quantum leakage error occurs already in the order of @xmath150 , see ref .  ] .",
    "the leakage to the higher charge states out of the computational subspace can therefore be considered within the framework of landau - zener tunneling , which has already been discussed above .",
    "the renormalization of ( degenerate ) energy of the computational space is irrelevant in our geometric scheme since it does not rely on the dynamical time - evolution operator but only on the purely geometric means .    in reality",
    "there are fluctuations of the ( reduced ) flux @xmath151 ( tuning the junctions ) and the gate - induced charge @xmath11 ( resulting from the fluctuations of random charges in the substrate or gate voltage itself ) .",
    "one consequence of these fluctuations is the landau - zener - type transitions out of the computational subspace .",
    "a recent experiment on josephson charge qubits  @xcite suggests that fluctuations of @xmath152 as well as @xmath151 are dominated by low frequency fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the landau - zener - type transitions might be small .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath152 can cause another type of errors : while the eigenspace is by construction robust against the low - frequency fluctuations of @xmath151 , the random charge fluctuations lift the degeneracy of the computational subspace .",
    "the wave function of the system then acquires dynamically accumulated phase factors @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the small level spacing caused by the fluctuations of @xmath152 .",
    "such dynamical phases can be ignored for sufficiently small fluctuations and sufficiently short  yet long enough for adiabaticity  operation time ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "another common source of decoherence in josephson charge qubits is the quasi - particle tunneling  @xcite . in particular , since the computational eigenspace is not the lowest energy states [ eq .",
    "( [ holonomic : prototype ] ) and fig .",
    "[ holonomic : fig2 ] ( b ) ] , it gives rise to the relaxation out of the eigenspace to lower energy states ( this effect can not be described by the landau - zener - type transitions ) . at sufficiently low temperatures compared with the superconducting gap @xmath156 ,",
    "the quasi - particle tunneling rate @xmath157 is exponentially small  @xcite , @xmath158 $ ] .",
    "for example , in the experiment on cooper - pair box  @xcite , @xmath159 at temperature @xmath160 even through the probe junction which was biased by a voltage @xmath161 ( without the voltage bias @xmath157 should be even smaller ) .",
    "in such a situation , one can therefore conclude that the effect of quasi - particles is negligible .    for a brief comparison of the present scheme with the conventional josephson charge qubit  @xcite",
    ", we estimate the fidelity for a single phase - shift operation @xmath65 .",
    "the fidelity in this case is given by @xmath162 } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath163 is the probability for lanau - zener - type transitions or quasiparticle tunnelings to occur and @xmath164 is the error in phase shift due to the background charge fluctuations , i.e. , @xmath165 ( see above ) .",
    "taking @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 ( see ref .  ) , one estimates @xmath171 . in the dynamic scheme the fidelity is also given by the same form as eq .",
    "( [ paper::eq : fidelity ] ) .",
    "the differences are that @xmath163 is mainly responsible for the quasiparticle tunnelings and that the phase error @xmath164 comes from the finite ramping time of the gate pulse .",
    "taking the parameters from the recent experiment  @xcite , we see that the fidelity takes the same value ( up to three digits below decimal point ) .",
    "lastly , in ideal case some tunable junctions [ e.g. , @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( [ holonomic : h3 ] ) , see discussions below eq .",
    "( [ holonomic : ket1b ] ) ] need to be turned off completely . in reality , the josephson energies of the two parallel junctions on a squid loop ( fig .",
    "[ holonomic : fig1 ] ) may not be identical [ i.e. , @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ holonomic : junction ] ) and fig .",
    "[ holonomic : fig1 ] ] .",
    "then , a tunable junction ( i.e. squid ) can not be turned off completely  @xcite .",
    "this makes it nontrivial to prepare an initial state which should be a product state of the `` true '' qubit and the ancilla qubits in a logical block [ see , e.g. , @xmath89 below eq .  ] . in practice",
    ", such a difficulty can be overcome by means of fast relaxation processes with the gate voltages of the ancilla qubits adjusted far off the resonance in the initial state - preparation stage .",
    "this process also allows for preparation of the `` true '' qubit in a definite initial state  @xcite .",
    "we have proposed a scheme based on geometric means to implement quantum computation on solid - state devices .",
    "the main advantage of a geometric computation scheme is its intrinsically fault - tolerant feature  @xcite .",
    "however , it is usually non - trivial to find a physical system whose hamiltonian has a particular degenerate structure for geometric computation .",
    "the scheme discussed in this work provides a generic way to construct such a system from arbitrary quantum two - state systems as long as couplings satisfy certain requirements specified above .",
    "such requirements are rather easy to fulfill on solid - state devices .",
    "a drawback of this scheme is that it requires more resources ( four cooper - pair boxes per each qubit ) .",
    "considering quantum error correcting codes , however , it may not be a major disadvantage .",
    "moreover , since the current scheme is based on adiabatic evolution , it does not require sharp pulses of flux and gate voltage . with current technology",
    ", it is still challenging to obtain a sufficiently sharp pulses of flux and gate voltages ( in ref .",
