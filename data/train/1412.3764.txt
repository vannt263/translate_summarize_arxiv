    "the observations and analyses of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the wmap @xcite and planck @xcite collaborations strongly support single - field slow - roll inflation as the paradigm of early universe cosmology .",
    "the current cmb data can be successfully described by many models of inflation .",
    "prominent examples are the starobinsky model @xcite , chaotic inflation @xcite , natural inflation @xcite and hybrid inflation @xcite , which differ significantly in their predictions for the scalar spectral index @xmath0 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath1 of the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "the recently released bicep2 data @xcite , which are presently under intense scrutiny @xcite , have renewed the interest in models with a large fraction of tensor modes .",
    "a theoretically attractive framework is supersymmetric d - term inflation @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that it contains the rather different models listed above for different choices of the khler potential : for a canonical khler potential one obtains standard hybrid inflation , for a superconformal or no - scale khler potential the starobinsky model emerges @xcite , and in case of a shift symmetric khler potential @xcite d - term inflation includes a `` chaotic regime '' with a large tensor - to - scalar ratio @xcite .    in this note we study the chaotic regime of d - term inflation in more detail .",
    "it turns out that the predictions are qualitatively similar to those of natural inflation , although the theoretical interpretation is entirely different .",
    "moreover , there are significant quantitative differences .",
    "the parameters of d - term inflation are a yukawa coupling , the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term and a gauge coupling .",
    "the last two determine the energy scale @xmath6 of hybrid inflation .",
    "the measured amplitude of scalar fluctuations determines @xmath6 as function of the yukawa coupling . imposing the bounds of the planck data on @xmath0 and @xmath1 as constraints @xcite , @xmath7",
    "we find that @xmath6 has to be close to the energy scale @xmath8 of grand unification .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a lower bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath9 for @xmath10 @xmath5-folds before the end of inflation , which is in reach of upcoming experiments .",
    "the framework of d - term hybrid inflation in supergravity is defined by a khler potential , a superpotential and a d - term scalar potential @xcite , @xmath11 the `` waterfall fields '' @xmath12 carry the u(1 ) charges @xmath13 , and the inflaton is contained in the gauge singlet @xmath14 .",
    "the khler potential is invariant under the shift @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a real constant , i.e. , it is independent of the constant part of @xmath17 , which is identified as the inflaton field .",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a yukawa coupling , which may be much smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "the only dimensionful parameter is the fi term @xmath21 that sets the energy scale of inflation . as a constant . ]",
    "standard hybrid inflation takes place at inflaton field values @xmath22 larger than the critical value @xmath23 . here",
    "the waterfall fields @xmath12 have a positive mass squared and are stabilized at the origin .",
    "classically , the potential is independent of modulus and phase of the gauge - singlet @xmath14 .",
    "the flatness in @xmath24 is lifted by quantum corrections .    for subcritical field values @xmath25",
    "the complex scalar @xmath26 remains stabilized at the origin , whereas @xmath27 acquires a tachyonic instability .",
    "the sum of f- and d - terms yields for the scalar potential as function of @xmath22 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 note that , due to the shift symmetry of the khler potential , the planck suppressed terms are also only quadratic in @xmath22 . the scalar potential contains higher powers in @xmath30 , which we have neglected since they are not important for inflation .    following ref.@xcite , we solve the classical equations of motion for homogeneous fields , corresponding to the scalar potential , @xmath31 the initial conditions for the waterfall field are obtained by considering the tachyonic growth of its quantum fluctuations @xcite close to the critical point @xmath32 , @xmath33 here @xmath34 are the momentum modes of the field operator in an exponentially expanding , spacially flat background with hubble parameter @xmath35 and a time - dependent inflaton field @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 the integration in eq .",
    "extends over all soft momentum modes below @xmath38 where the time - dependent mass operator for @xmath34 in the brackets of eq .",
    "vanishes . at a decoherence time",
    "@xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the waterfall field becomes classical .",
    "matching the variance and classical field near the decoherence time , @xmath42 , one obtains @xmath43 and @xmath44 at @xmath45 . as shown in ref.@xcite , the classical waterfall field reaches the local , inflaton - dependent minimum soon after the decoherence time , @xmath46 and , together with the inflaton field , it reaches the global minimum after a large number of @xmath5-folds .",
    ", with @xmath47 . for reference , a quadratic potential is shown ( dashed line ) .",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the inflaton field values at the beginning of the waterfall transition , beginning and end of the last 50 @xmath5-folds of inflation .",
    "parameters : @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "( see also fig.3 in ref.@xcite ) . ]    on the inflationary trajectory , the inflaton potential takes a simple form , @xmath52 for small @xmath22 , the potential is quadratic , and as @xmath22 approaches @xmath32 , the potential reaches the plateau @xmath53 .",
    "fig.[fig : potential ] shows the potential for a certain choice of parameters . as we shall see in the following sections , in the relevant parameter range the predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "only depend on the potential . the initial conditions , in particular the initial value of @xmath22 and the tachyonic growth of the waterfall field only affect the total number of @xmath5-folds and the formation of cosmic strings .",
    "in this section we analyse the implications of the constraints on the cosmological observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 by the planck data on the parameters of the inflaton potential .",
    "obviously , the potential only depends on two parameters , which can be chosen as @xmath54 where we have used @xmath55 .",
    "then the energy density of the plateau is given by @xmath56 .",
    "scalar spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio are conveniently expressed in terms of the slow - roll parameters of the inflaton potential , @xmath57 where the superscript ` prime ' denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath22 , and we have set the planck mass @xmath58 .",
    "inflation ends at @xmath59 which is defined by @xmath60 .",
    "the number of @xmath5-folds between @xmath61 and @xmath62 can then be expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 . solving this equation ,",
    "one obtains @xmath48 in terms of @xmath65 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the first 3 terms in the expansion yield @xmath48 to sufficient accuracy . together with the standard expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , this yields @xmath0 and @xmath1 for a given number of @xmath5-folds @xmath65 .",
    "finally , a crucial observable is the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum @xmath73 , @xmath74 which is determined as @xmath75 at @xmath76% cl  @xcite from the combined data sets of the planck and wmap collaborations . imposing the central value of @xmath73 as constraint yields a line in the @xmath77 plane for a given number of @xmath5-folds .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : minf_phic ] for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the shaded region is consistent with the constraints of the planck data on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the energy scale of the plateau is rather precisely determined , @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "it is very remarkable how accurately the energy scale @xmath6 of the plateau agrees with the energy scale @xmath82 of gauge coupling unification in the supersymmetric standard model . for comparison , fig.[fig : minf_phic ] also shows the allowed region in the @xmath83 plane .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath32 , and also @xmath48 are super - planckian , similar to chaotic inflation .",
    "the treatment of the initial tachyonic growth of the waterfall field is consistent , while @xmath84 is small enough to allow for 60 @xmath5-folds below the critical point  @xcite . ]",
    "varying @xmath85 yields a line also in the @xmath86 plane for a given number of @xmath5-folds . in fig.[fig :",
    "nsr ] the result is compared with various constraints from cmb data and the prediction of natural inflation @xcite .",
    "as one can see , subcritical hybrid inflation and natural inflation @xcite yield qualitatively similar predictions .",
    "this is not surprising , given the similarity of the potential to a cosine - potential .",
    "the interpretation , however , is very different . in natural inflaton",
    "the band is obtained by varying a super - planckian axion decay constant or , as in aligned two - axion models @xcite , the ratio of sub - planckian decay constants . on the contrary , in subcritical hybrid inflation different points of the band",
    "correspond to different values of the ratio of a small yukawa coupling and a gauge coupling @xmath87 .",
    "the lower bound from the planck data on the spectral index @xmath0 implies the lower bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath88 for @xmath89 @xmath5-folds before the end of inflation .",
    "% and @xmath90% cl regions in the @xmath91 plane from planck data in combination with other data sets compared to natural inflation , as given in ref.@xcite , and subcritical hybrid inflation ( green ) . ]",
    "let us finally comment on the formation of cosmic strings in subcritical hybrid inflation .",
    "cosmic strings are produced during the tachyonic growth of the waterfall field , which spontaneously breaks the u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "the initial average distance of the cosmic strings can be estimated as  @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the scale factor and @xmath94 is the spinodal time at which @xmath95 reaches the local , inflaton - dependent minimum @xmath96 . between @xmath94 and @xmath61 , the beginning of the last 5060 @xmath5-folds , the scale factor grows by @xmath97 @xmath5-folds whereas the hubble parameter remains almost constant , @xmath98 , which yields for the average string separation at @xmath61 , @xmath99 the smallest value of @xmath97 is obtained for the largest coupling @xmath100 : @xmath101 ( see figs.[fig : potential ] and [ fig : minf_phic ] ) . during the final @xmath79@xmath4 @xmath5-folds the horizon at @xmath61",
    "is blown up to @xmath102 , the size of the present universe .",
    "we thus obtain the lower bound on the average cosmic string distance @xmath103 hence , cosmic strings are unobservable in subcritical hybrid inflation for parameters consistent with the planck data .",
    "we have studied subcritical hybrid inflation , which occurs in supersymmetric d - term inflation for small couplings of the inflaton to matter . the effective inflaton potential interpolates between a quadratic potential at small field values and a plateau at large field values .",
    "it is characterized by two parameters , the energy scale of the plateau , and the critical value of the inflaton field , at which the plateau is reached .",
    "the model can accommodate the planck data very well , and it is striking how accurately the energy scale @xmath6 of inflation agrees with the scale @xmath82 of gauge coupling unification in the supersymmetric standard model .",
    "this reopens the question on the possible connection between grand unification and inflation .",
    "the predictions for the scalar spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio are qualitatively similar to those from natural inflation .",
    "quantitatively , however , the predicted values for the tensor - to - scalar ratio are larger and one obtains the lower bounds @xmath104 for @xmath10 @xmath5-folds before the end of inflation , which is in reach of upcoming experiments .",
