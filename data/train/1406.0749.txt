    "coherent states are widespread in physics @xcite . in particular , coherent states defined as @xmath1 where the states @xmath2 are fock or number states , are of great interest in optics as they have properties related to the classical radiation field @xcite . these coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath3 and it is possible to generalize them as nonlinear coherent states @xcite , @xmath4 a class of such nonlinear coherent states are the standard single - photon - added coherent states @xcite , @xmath5 where the nonlinear function is given by , @xmath6 and the photon number operator is @xmath7 .",
    "these photon - added states can be approximately generated in the laboratory by conditional measurement in the jaynes - cummings dynamics @xcite , in a beam splitter @xcite , or in spontaneous parametric down - conversion @xcite , to mention a few examples .",
    "additional proposals to realize them in cavity or ion - trap quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite , kerr media @xcite , and in quantum mechanical systems with non - linear potentials @xcite have also been produced .",
    "single - photon added coherent states are known to be non - classical non - gaussian states and , thus , useful for quantum information processing @xcite .    here , we are interested in a different class of photon - added and subtracted states based on the revival time found in the two - photon jaynes - cummings model @xcite , which is known to approximately add or subtract two photons from the initial quantized field state depending on the initial state of the qubit @xcite .",
    "we propose to use the london phase operators @xcite , also known as susskind - glogower operators @xcite , that lower and raise the state of a quantized field , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , to define a general @xmath0-photon added state , @xmath10^{m } \\vert \\psi \\rangle , \\quad \\vert \\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty } c_{j } \\vert j \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that keeps the state normalized , @xmath11 , and adds @xmath0 photons to the mean photon number of the initial state , @xmath12 the case of @xmath0-photon subtracted states can be defined in an equivalent form , @xmath13^m \\vert \\psi \\rangle , \\quad \\vert \\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty } c_{j } \\vert j \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to keep the state normalized .",

    ", we will show that our definition of photon added and subtracted states is experimentally feasible in cavity- and ion - trap - qed .",
    "then , we will present the particular case of photon added and subtracted coherent states that can be seen as nonlinear coherent states and show how to generate approximated @xmath0-photon added and subtracted coherent states with the proposed experimental schemes .",
    "let us consider the two - photon jaynes - cummings model @xcite , @xmath18 describing the interaction of a quantized field and a qubit ; e.g. a two - level atom interacting with the quantized field of a cavity or a two - level trapped ion interacting with the quantized motion of its center of mass .",
    "the field is described by the frequency @xmath19 and the creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and the qubit by the frequency @xmath22 and the pauli operators @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the interaction between the qubit and the quantized field is given by the parameter g and in both the cavity- and ion - trap - qed examples it must fulfill @xmath25 . on resonance , @xmath26 ,",

    "the origin of our definition for addition and subtraction of two - photons is that we obtain the following approximated states of the field at a time @xmath38 , @xmath39 we require that the initial field state does not have fock state components below the critical parameter @xmath36 , in order to satisfy the restrictions in the approximations and .",
    "note that this allows us to fulfill the restriction in .",
    "thus , in a cavity - qed implementation , if the cavity field starts in the state @xmath40 and we let an atom in the excited or ground state fly through the cavity such that @xmath38 , then the initial cavity field will approximately end in the two - photon added or subtracted state , @xmath41 or @xmath41 , as long as it did not have low fock state components in the beginning .",
