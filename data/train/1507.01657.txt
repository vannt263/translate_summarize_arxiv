    "the most recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data by the planck satellite  @xcite are in excellent agreement with the assumption of adiabatic primordial scalar perturbation with nearly scale - invariant power spectrum , described by a simple power law with spectral index @xmath2 very close to ( albeit different from ) unity @xcite .",
    "it would be produced in the simplest inflationary scenario , in which a single , minimally - coupled scalar field slowly rolls down a smooth potential .    in spite of this , models that accounts for the localised ` features ' in the primordial power spectrum provide a better fit to the data with respect to a smooth power - law spectrum @xcite .",
    "features in the primordial power spectrum can be generated following departures from slow roll , that can happen in more general inflationary models with a symmetry - breaking phase transition .",
    "it is the case of the inflationary models with a parametrized step in the primordial potential , which show oscillations in the power spectrum of curvature perturbations , localised around the scale that is crossing the horizon at the time the phase transition occurred  @xcite .    the main tools for analyse ( and constrain ) the inflationary models are the current cmb temperature power spectrum and bispectrum  @xcite .",
    "another important approach to study viable inflation models is through the non - gaussian signatures produced during the inflationary phase , that left imprints in the cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "recent constraints on primordial non - gaussianities ( ngs ) found in the planck collaboration analyses  @xcite severely constrain those of local type ( hereafter _ local_-ng ) , supporting the simplest inflationary model based on a single minimally - coupled scalar field .",
    "however , such analyses do not rule out inflationary models producing other types of primordial ng , whenever consistent with such constraints . in this scenario ,",
    "inflationary models with a step - like feature in the inflaton potential deserve particular consideration  @xcite .",
    "non - gaussian signals , primordial or not , appear mixed in the cmb planck maps , with each phenomenon contributing with their own signature .",
    "various statistical methods are proposed in the literature  @xcite in order to detect all the potential ng components in the cmb , to measure their intensity and their angular scale dependence .",
    "here we use the minkowski functionals ( mfs )  @xcite as statistical estimators to look for non - gaussian features in several sets of simulated maps . between others , we analyse monte carlo cmb maps , seeded by the cmb angular power spectrum originated from inflationary models with a step - like feature in the inflaton potential , and compare them with simulated cmb maps based on the @xmath1cdm concordance model , for which we use the current data of the planck collaboration  @xcite .",

    "third , and more interestingly , the gaussian deviations shown in the plots of fig .  [ fig5 ] makes clear that the set of mfs are able to discriminate distinct ngs imprinted in cmb maps : the non - gaussian signatures appearing in the sets of mc cmb maps emerging from _ models a _ and _ b _ are not of the type , neither intensity , expected in maps contaminated with primordial _ local_-ng , deserving a closer analyses ( to be done in the next subsection ) .",
    "+    +    +        +    +    +        our analyses here are aimed to answer the question : are there distinguishable non - gaussian features left in simulated cmb maps generated by _",

    "our analyses of the four cmb data sets , that is , the mc sets ( ii ) to ( v ) , show consistency at a 1@xmath118 level with the mfs obtained from the gaussian @xmath1cdm maps , as seen in fig .",

    "our examinations show , except in the area - mf case , that the cmb maps seeded by the power spectra of _ models a _ ( set ( ii ) ) and _ b _ ( set ( iii ) ) evidence a larger gaussian deviation , with fully distinct signature , as compared with the results from the mc cmb maps contaminated with primordial _",

    "[ fig5 ] , that a distinguished departure from gaussianity comes from the analyses of these cmb data produced from _",
    "models a _ and _ b _ , with the remarkable feature that for the _ model b _ case the gaussian deviation appears with the same signature than for the _ model a _ case but it is notoriously larger . in other words ,",
    "inflationary _ models a _ and _ b _ produce a noticeable ( in type and intensity ) gaussian deviation as measured by the mfs , where they are best revealed by the perimeter and n@xmath116 mfs , and less efficiently by the genus , beside being robust under different masks applied .",
    "all these results let us to conclude that the non - gaussian signals found in the mc maps seeded by the cmb power spectra from inflation _ models a _ and _ b _ are contributions with a definite signature originated in the inflationary phase , suggesting an effective probe to the primordial universe .      the third part of our analyses concerns the calculation of the mfs from the four foreground - cleaned planck cmb maps , considering the above mentioned masks . in figs .  [ fig6 ] to  [ fig9 ] we present the relative difference between the mfs calculated for each one of these planck maps and the corresponding mf mean obtained for the five sets of mc cmb maps . in tables [ table1 ] ( for the @xmath105 mask ) and [ table2 ] ( for the @xmath101-mask ) we show the @xmath121 values , for 25 degrees of freedom , corresponding to the best - fit between the mf from the planck map and the mean mf for each of the five mc sets in scrutiny .",

    "the area ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) and genus ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) functionals appear to be the less conclusive , each one presenting quite similar differences for all the four planck maps and for both masks .",
    "regarding the perimeter ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) and n@xmath116 ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) , the panels show a great concordance between gaussian and non - gaussian ( i.e. , @xmath122 ) @xmath1cdm seeded maps , presenting just tiny relative differences for the four planck maps .",

    "the detection of gaussian deviations , as evidenced by departures of the mfs curves compared with the corresponding ones from gaussian cmb maps , clearly suggest the presence of non - gaussian signals . exploring this inference more carefully , we analysed the relative difference between the mean mfs obtained from the four sets of maps , sets ( ii ) to ( v ) , and that one corresponding to gaussian simulations , set ( i ) , seeded by the @xmath1cdm power spectrum . from the obtained results , it is inferred that mc cmb maps generated from _",

    "moreover , it was possible to reveal the distinctive signature and amplitude of the gaussian deviations present in the mc cmb maps seeded by the power spectra from _ model a _ , that one that fits planck data better than @xmath1cdm model , and _ model b _ , when compared to the non - gaussian simulations ( i.e. , @xmath122 ) .    finally , in the last part of this work we analysed the four foreground - cleaned planck cmb maps in the current context .",
    "the analyses of the relative differences between the mfs of each planck map and the average mfs from the five sets of mc cmb maps confirm a good agreement between the planck data and data coming from the mc seeded by _",

    "any convincing deviation from gaussianity results from a robust detection by the mfs , which include analyses with different masks .",
    "in addition , such departures are larger when the power spectrum features appears exaggerated ( this refers to _ model b _ ` features ' with respect to those of _ model a _ , see figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] ) , then the main conclusions of the current analyses regarding the mc cmb maps derived from inflationary models with a step - like potential ( i.e. , the mc sets ( ii ) and ( iii ) ) are :    * the non - gaussian contributions found in these sets of mc cmb maps are of primordial origin .",
    "* these net gaussian deviations , as robustly detected by the mfs , are not accounted by primordial _",
    "local_-ng , neither in intensity nor in signature . *",
    "the non - gaussian signatures in planck cmb data , as revealed by mfs , are better described by mc maps seeded by _",
    "model s a _ cmb spectrum .",
    "additionally , it is opportune to inquire about the type and level of the ng detected . according to the results of _ chen et al . _",
    "@xcite , inflationary models with a step - like potential would produce detectable levels of ng of equilateral type , with expected amplitude @xmath126 , for the step parameters considered in _",
    "model a_. moreover , as showed in table  [ table1 ] , the @xmath121 best - fit satisfied by the mcs from _ model a _ indicates that the ng observed in the foreground - cleaned planck maps is fully compatible with the ng ( of equilateral type as predicted by  @xcite ) found by our perimeter - mf analyses in these mc cmb maps ( see fig .",
