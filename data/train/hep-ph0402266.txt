    "for several decades , experiments have been trying to test the standard model ( sm ) paradigm that neutrinos are massless and interact only via the @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge boson exchange . in recent years",
    ", a breakthrough has emerged : data from the solar , atmospheric , and reactor neutrino experiments have indicated that neutrinos do have masses , and hence the sm is incomplete .",
    "it is the right time to ask whether the sm predictions for the neutrino - matter interactions can be similarly tested .",
    "the aim of this letter is to investigate what can be learned about neutrino - matter interactions from present and future solar and kamland neutrino data .",
    "we answer two questions : ( i ) can the solar and kamland experiments constrain parts of the parameter space that are presently inaccessible by non - oscillation experiments ?",
    "( ii ) can the uncertainty in our present knowledge of neutrino - matter interactions affect the determination of the oscillation parameters ? as we show , the answer to both questions is affirmative .",
    "we give explicit examples of parameters that are disfavored by solar and kamland data and that are beyond the reach of non - oscillation experiments .",
    "we also demonstrate that nonstandard interactions ( nsi ) , at an allowed level , can qualitatively modify the fit to the data and change the values of inferred mass parameters .",
    "this scenario leads to nontrivial predictions for future experiments .",
    "a full presentation of the numerical constraints we obtain is beyond the scope of this letter and will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we study the effects of nsi _ on top of _ nonzero neutrino masses and mixing , since the latter are required by the kamland data .",
    "this scenario has been previously studied @xcite with an emphasis on the limit of small flavor - changing interactions .",
    "we extend the formalism developed in these papers to make it applicable to our problem .",
    "low - energy neutrino interactions can be described by four - fermion interaction vertices , @xmath4 .",
    "the vertices affecting neutrino evolution in matter are those containing two neutrino lines ( @xmath5 ) . in the sm ,",
    "these vertices receive contributions from neutral current ( nc ) processes and , if the initial state contains a charged lepton , also charged current ( cc ) processes .",
    "the nc processes are predicted to be flavor - preserving and universal .",
    "possible non - standard ( both flavor - preserving and flavor - changing ) contributions to the @xmath5 vertices can , most generally , be parameterized as @xmath6 here @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) denotes the strength of the nsi between the neutrinos @xmath9 of flavors @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the left - handed ( right - handed ) components of the fermions @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the fermi constant .",
    "bounds on the epsilons come from accelerator - based experiments , such as nutev @xcite and charm @xcite , and experiments involving charged leptons . in the later case , we do not include bounds obtained by the @xmath15 symmetry , since strictly speaking these can be avoided if , for example , the corresponding operators contain higgs doublets @xcite .",
    "both types of experiments are quite effective at constraining the vertices involving the muon neutrino , giving @xmath16 , @xmath17 . at the same time , bounds on @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are rather loose , _ e.g. _ , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24@xcite .",
    "nsi can modify both the neutrino propagation ( oscillation ) @xcite and neutrino detection processes .",
    "the propagation effects of nsi are , first of all , only sensitive to @xmath25 when @xmath26 ( henceforth , @xmath27 ) , and , second , only to the vector component of that interaction , @xmath28 .",
    "the matter piece of the oscillation hamiltonian can be written ( up to an irrelevant constant ) as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number density of electrons in the medium .",
    "the epsilons here are the sum of the contributions from electrons ( @xmath31 ) , up quarks ( @xmath32 ) , and down quarks ( @xmath33 ) in matter : @xmath34 .",
    "hence , unlike in the standard case ( @xmath35 ) , the nsi matter effects depend on the chemical composition of the medium .",
    "the cc detection reactions at sno , kamland and the radiochemical experiments , just like the production reactions in the sun , are unchanged by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagnsi ] ) . on the other hand , the neutrino - electron elastic scattering ( es ) reactions at super - kamiokande and sno , and the nc reaction at sno could be affected .",
    "the sno nc reaction is an axial current process @xcite , while the es reaction depends on both axial and vector parts .",
    "hence , the former is independent of the oscillation hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) , while the latter is not .",
    "since both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are strongly constrained , we set them to zero and vary @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . even with this reduction , the parameter space of the problem is quite large : different assignment of the diagonal and offdiagonal nsi to electrons and @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks yield different dependences of the oscillation hamiltonian on the chemical composition and different detection cross sections . to avoid complicating our main point with technical details , we limit our study to the case of nsi on quarks , assigning the same strength to the neutrino interactions with @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks .    for the solar neutrino analysis , we perform the standard reduction of the @xmath40 hamiltonian to a @xmath41 hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this involves performing a rotation in the @xmath42 subspace by the atmospheric angle @xmath43 and taking the first two columns / rows .",
    "this simplification is valid if ( i ) the @xmath44 mixing angle is small : @xmath45 and ( ii ) @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the neutrino energy and @xmath48 the difference of the squared masses , @xmath49 , as given by atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "the first requirement is ensured by the experimental bound from chooz @xcite ; the second one can be checked to hold even for @xmath19 of order unity .",
    "the vacuum oscillation hamiltonian then takes the usual form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the mass splitting between the first and second neutrino mass states : @xmath53 .",
    "the matter contribution can be written ( once again , up to an irrelevant overall constant ) as : @xmath54 where the quantities @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) depend on the original epsilons and on the rotation angle @xmath43 : @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cecidef2 ] ) , small corrections of order @xmath58 or higher have been neglected .",
    "we introduce a useful parameterization : @xmath59 here the parameters @xmath60 , @xmath10 and @xmath61 are defined as follows : @xmath62/2}~. \\label{eq : cecidef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in absence of nsi we have @xmath63 , @xmath64 and the hamiltonian ( [ eq : mat_convention ] ) reduces to its standard form .",
    "notice the appearance of the phase @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mat_convention ] ) . since the phases of the basis states are chosen to make the elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vac_convention ] ) real , @xmath61 can not be _ simultaneously _ removed .",
    "this has been noted in the studies of terrestrial neutrino beams @xcite , but overlooked in the solar neutrino literature .",
    "what is the physical range for the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath10 and @xmath61 ? in the standard case @xmath64 , the physical range of @xmath65 is @xmath66 $ ] , including the so - called  light \" and  dark \" sides @xcite .",
    "a generalization to the nsi case is @xmath67,\\;\\;\\;\\alpha \\in [ 0,\\pi/2],\\;\\;\\;\\phi \\in      [ -\\pi/2,\\pi/2].\\ ] ] these ranges of parameters cover all possibilities in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vac_convention],[eq : mat_convention ] ) . for solar neutrinos",
    ", the range of @xmath61 could be cut in half , since points with @xmath61 and @xmath68 give the same probability @xmath69 that a @xmath70 produced in the sun is seen as a @xmath70 in a detector .",
    "moreover , the points @xmath71 and @xmath72 are related by @xmath73 , which are equal in the 2-neutrino case by unitarity .",
    "let us determine the expression for @xmath69 .",
    "we first note that , because kamland selects @xmath74 ev@xmath75 , coherence between the hamiltonian eigenstates is completely lost once one integrates over the neutrino energy spectrum and the neutrino production region in the sun .",
    "the expression for the incoherent survival probability can be most easily derived in the basis that diagonalizes the matter hamiltonian ( [ eq : mat_convention ] ) .",
    "we obtain the familiar form @xcite @xmath76/2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the mixing angle at the neutrino production point in the solar core and @xmath78 is the level crossing probability .",
    "these quantities contain all the effects of the nsi .",
    "the angle @xmath77 is given by @xmath79 here @xmath80 at the neutrino production point .",
    "the expression for @xmath78 is also easily found in the same basis , where it becomes apparent that the dynamics of conversion in matter depends only on the relative orientation of the eigenstates of the vacuum and matter hamiltonians .",
    "this allows to directly apply the known analytical solutions for @xmath78 , and , upon rotating back , obtain a generalization of these results to the nsi case .",
    "for example , the answer for the infinite exponential profile @xcite @xmath81 becomes @xmath82 - 1)/[\\exp(\\gamma)-1]$ ] , where @xmath83 .",
    "we further observe that since @xmath84 the adiabaticity violation occurs only when @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which is the analogue of the small - angle msw @xcite effect in the rotated basis .",
    "the `` resonant '' region in the sun where level jumping can take place is narrow , defined by @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "a neutrino produced at a lower density evolves adiabatically , while a neutrino produced at a higher density may undergo level crossing .",
    "the probability @xmath78 in the latter case is given to a very good accuracy by the formula for the linear profile , with an appropriate gradient taken along the neutrino trajectory , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the step function , @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 otherwise .",
    "we emphasize that our results differ from the similar ones given in @xcite in three important respects : ( i ) they are valid for all , not just small values of @xmath10 ( which is essential for our application ) , ( ii ) they include the angle @xmath61 , and ( iii ) the argument of the @xmath93 function does not contain @xmath94 , as follows from @xcite .",
    "we stress that for large values of @xmath10 and @xmath95 adiabaticity is violated for large values of @xmath65 .",
    "finally , to get an idea on the size of the day / night asymmetry , @xmath96 , ( here @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) denotes the @xmath70 flux at the detector during the day ( night ) ) we can model the earth as a sufficiently long ( compared to the oscillation length ) object of constant density .",
    "for @xmath99b neutrino energies , this is appropriate for @xmath100 . introducing a small parameter @xmath101 , where @xmath60 is evaluated for a typical density inside the earth , we find , to the first order in @xmath102 , @xmath103^{-1 }        - \\cos 2\\theta}.\\ ] ] we verified that eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_dn_phi ] ) gives a good agreement with precise numerical calculations for @xmath104 moles/@xmath105 .",
    "for the lower @xmath52 region allowed by kamland , @xmath106 , the oscillation length is comparable to the size of the earth , however , the averaging in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_dn_phi ] ) still applies to a signal integrated over the zenith angle .",
    "ev@xmath75 , @xmath107 and several representative values of the nsi parameters : ( 1 ) @xmath108 ; ( 2 ) @xmath109 , @xmath110 ; ( 3 ) @xmath111 , @xmath112 ; ( 4 ) @xmath111 , @xmath113 .",
    "recall that the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cecidef2 ] ) equal @xmath114.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : peeadn ] we plot the neutrino survival probability as a function of energy for several representative values of the nsi parameters .",
    "we take @xmath52 and @xmath65 corresponding to the best - fit lma point and choose the production point to be at @xmath115 .",
    "curve ( 1 ) is the standard interaction case , given for reference .",
    "the other three curves represent the three qualitatively different regimes that are of interest to us . in the following we illustrate them in connection with observations . for definiteness",
    ", we consider real values of @xmath116 , both positive ( @xmath117 ) and negative ( @xmath118 ) . as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mat_convention ] ) , complex values ( @xmath119 ) interpolate between these two cases .",
    "we now turn to the comparison of the nsi predictions with observations . to do this , we perform a best fit analysis of the solar neutrino and kamland data along the lines of refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , solar data include the radiochemical rates  @xcite , the sk es zenith - spectra  @xcite , the sno day - night spectra  @xcite measured in phase - i and the sno rates measured in phase - ii  @xcite . for consistency ,",
    "the nc rate prediction for sno is treated as a free parameter because it is affected by an unknown change in the axial coupling of the quarks that could accompany the vector nsi considered in our analysis @xcite . in our calculations",
    ", we use the updated bp04  @xcite standard solar model ( ssm ) fluxes , electron density and neutrino production point distributions in the sun . for kamland we considered the measured antineutrino spectrum with visible energies higher than 2.6 mev @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients of our analysis turn out to be the rates and energy spectrum data from sno and super - kamiokande .",
    "a comparison of the sno cc rate with the super - kamiokande rate @xcite and the ssm indicates that , within the energy range accessible for the two experiments , the electron neutrino survival probability is about 30% .",
    "no other distinguishing features , such as a day / night asymmetry or spectral distortion , are seen at a statistically significant level @xcite . in the case of the sm interaction , this turn out to be a very restrictive condition ; as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : peeadn ] , the range of energies for which the survival probability is constant at 30% ( henceforth , `` the flat window '' ) is barely large enough to cover the sno energy window . on the low - energy end , the resonant condition in the solar core increases the neutrino survival probability ;",
    "on the high - energy end , the resonant condition in the earth causes a large d / n effect .",
    "hence , values of the nsi parameters that  shrink \" the flat window , or shift it in the region disfavored by kamland , can be excluded .",
    "conversely , if nsi increase the size of the flat window , new solutions may emerge .",
    "a typical behavior for this case is exhibited by curve ( 3 ) : the  step \" in @xmath69 becomes longer and the day / night asymmetry is not much smaller than in the sm case .",
    "these features point to a possible conflict with data .",
    "our analysis confirms this expectation : a parameter scan @xcite for @xmath120 reveals that a significant fraction of the parameter space which is allowed by the accelerator - based data can be excluded by the solar / kamland data . as an example , we find that points with @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( here and later , @xmath123 is assumed ) are unacceptable at @xmath124 confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "if we keep @xmath60 in the core of the sun ( at @xmath125 ) fixed to its standard value , @xmath63 , we exclude points with @xmath126 at the same c.l .",
    "( for 1 degree of freedom , d.o.f , unless specified otherwise ) .",
    "the accelerator experiments allow values of order unity ( in absolute value ) for this parameter @xcite .",
    "we stress that the latter probe only @xmath127 , while , as we show here , oscillation experiments are sensitive to the complex phase @xmath61 ( or , for real epsilons , to the sign of @xmath116 ) .      for @xmath116 close to zero ( @xmath129 ) , the only effect of the nsi is to flatten the part of the @xmath69 curve around 5 - 6 mev , as illustrated by curve ( 2 ) in fig . [",
    "fig : peeadn ] .",
    "no new solutions appear and the allowed region in the @xmath65-@xmath52 plane is similar to that obtained with the sm interactions .",
    "this scenario has important implications for sno , which can probe it by lowering its energy threshold .",
    "and @xmath130 allowed at @xmath131 c.l .",
    "( 2 d.o.f ) for sm interactions ( left ) and the nsi scenario ( right ) described by eqs .",

    "its main feature is a significantly wider flat window , compared to the standard case .",
    "the key reason is the suppression of the day / night asymmetry on the high - energy end of the window .",
    "the physics of the suppression can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_dn_phi ] ) , which , for @xmath118 , gives @xmath136 .",
    "if the parameters are chosen in such a way that @xmath65 and @xmath10 _ in the earth _ are comparable , the earth regeneration effect is suppressed . because of the difference in chemical composition , the difference @xmath137 is larger in the sun and , consequently , the evolution in the sun is still adiabatic .",
    "a broader flat window allows the fit region to extend to lower values of @xmath52 compared to the standard case . while kamland excludes the middle part of the new region ,",
    "the bottom part of that region ( @xmath138 ev@xmath75 ) is , in fact , allowed @xcite .",
    "thus , in addition to the usual two solutions , lma - i and lma - ii , a completely new disconnected solution emerges , which we shall denote lma-0 .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] , in which we compare the allowed regions in the standard case to those computed for chosen values of the nsi parameters : @xmath139 , @xmath140 . the best - fit point in the lma-0 region",
    "has @xmath141 ev@xmath75 and @xmath142 , with @xmath143 .",
    "for the same nsi parameters , the @xmath144 has another minimum , @xmath145 , at @xmath146 ev@xmath75 and @xmath147 , corresponding to the lma - i solution .",
    "the quality of the fit for lma-0 and lma - i is comparable ; if only the kamland rate , and not spectrum , information is used , the lma-0 fit is slightly better ( @xmath148 , against @xmath149 for the minimum in the lma - i region ) . for comparison ,",
    "the best fit parameters for the standard case are @xmath146 ev@xmath75 and @xmath150 , with @xmath151 ( using the kamland spectrum ) .",
    "we stress that the existence of the lma-0 solution depends mainly on the value of @xmath10 in the earth and , to a lesser extent , on the value of the norm @xmath60 .",
    "hence , this solution persists for other choices of the nsi parameters , so long as they yield approximately the same @xmath10 in the earth .",
    "for example , if the diagonal interactions are assumed to be standard , @xmath152 , one finds a good fit in the lma-0 region for @xmath153 .",
    "our lma-0 solution should not , of course , be confused with the  very - low - lma \" solution @xcite , which arises under completely different physical assumptions , namely , if one assumes large ( @xmath154% ) density fluctuations @xcite in the sun .",
    "we note that the lma-0 solution requires that the value of the @xmath61 angle be not too different from @xmath155 .",
    "numerically , if we fix all the other parameters to the values of fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] and vary @xmath61 , we find that lma-0 disappears at 90% c.l . for @xmath156 .",
    "as @xmath61 is decreased further , the goodness of the overall fit decreases . indeed , for @xmath117 ( positive @xmath116 ) , the survival probability has the features of curve ( 3 ) in fig . [",
    "fig : peeadn ] , which are disfavored , as discussed earlier .",
    "the lma - i solution disappears at 90% c.l . for @xmath157 .",
    "a scan over the region of @xmath116 real and negative gives exclusion of regions of the parameter space allowed by accelerator limits .",
    "for instance , points with @xmath121 and @xmath158 are unacceptable at @xmath124 c.l . for @xmath60 fixed to the standard value @xmath159 in the solar core , the limit is @xmath160 , at @xmath124 c.l .",
    "our choice of @xmath161 implies @xmath162 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cecidef2 ] ) , in which we set @xmath163 ) , i.e. , for example , @xmath164 .",
    "this is about one order of magnitude smaller than the direct bound from charm @xcite .",
    "a more interesting question is whether the nsi parameters of interest for the lma-0 scenario could be tested with atmospheric neutrinos . for our specific case",
    ", the existing two - neutrino analyses @xcite do not provide an answer , as the problem is essentially a three - flavor one .",
    "our investigation @xcite shows that regions exist in the space of the nsi parameters where the effect of nsi on the atmospheric neutrino observables is minimal and a satisfactory fit to the data is obtained . as an example , a point in this allowed region is @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 .",
    "the survival probabilities for the best - fit point of the lma-0 solution and the standard lma - i solution are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pee ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the curves represent probabilities averaged over time and over the production region inside the sun for the @xmath99b and @xmath168 components of the solar neutrino spectrum according to @xcite .",
    "the probabilities for @xmath169be and @xmath170 neutrinos , not shown , are very close ( with less than @xmath171 difference ) to those for @xmath99b and @xmath168 respectively in the energy range of these neutrino fluxes .",
    "the energy intervals relevant to the different spectral components are also shown in the figure .",
    "the interval for @xmath99b neutrinos is cut from below at @xmath172 mev ; this approximately corresponds to the threshold of @xmath173 mev in the electron energy at the sno experiment .",
    "interestingly , the lma-0 solution has the features sought after in @xcite , where a sterile neutrino was introduced to eliminate the lma - i upturn at sno and improve the agreement with the homestake rate .",
    "it is remarkable that , despite the wealth of data collected up to this point , such radically different scenarios as lma-0 and lma - i can not be distinguished .",
    "the data expected in the next several years , on the other hand , should be able to resolve the ambiguity .",
    "first , if the sno experiment lowers its energy threshold , it may be able , with sufficient statistics , to look for the upturn expected for the lma - i solution .",
    "the absence of the upturn would indicate the presence of nsi , or some other new physics .",
    "second , the expected @xmath169be flux in the case of lma-0 is lower , and the difference could be detected by the borexino experiment ( or by the future solar phase of kamland ) .",
    "third , the small value of @xmath52 could be detected in the kamland spectrum data .",
    "the predicted spectra for lma - i ( standard interactions ) and lma-0 are shown in fig .  [ fig : pee ] ( top ) .",
    "it can be seen that the two are different at high energy where lma-0 predicts more events .",
    "thus , to make the discrimination it is necessary to both collect enough data and have a reliable calculation of the antineutrino flux for @xmath174 mev .",
    "finally , as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : pee ] , the two solutions make dramatically different predictions for a _ pep _ experiment",
    ".    while an observation consistent with the standard lma - i solution would allow placing a very effective constraint on the neutrino - matter interactions , a discovery of a deviation consistent with the nsi signal would have truly profound particle physics implications .",
    "for example , according to refs .",
    "@xcite , such interaction could be due to the operator of the form @xmath175 @xmath176 .",
    "for this operator to have an effect on the solar neutrino survival probability , the coefficient @xmath177 must not be too small , _",
    "i.e. _ , the scale of new physics @xmath178 must not be much higher that the weak scale ( higgs vev @xmath179 ) .",
    "thus , by looking for the nsi signatures in solar / reactor neutrinos the experiments could in fact be probing new physics at the tev scale .    in summary ,",
    "the present - day loose bounds on some of the neutrino interaction parameters introduce a serious uncertainty in the value of @xmath52 extracted from solar and kamland data , allowing for a new , disconnected solution .",
    "these uncertainties might be eliminated in the next several years , as more data are collected and analyzed by solar and kamland experiments .",
    "the constraints on the neutrino interactions presented here will be further extended . on the other hand , deviations from the sm neutrino interactions could indicate the presence of radically new physics .",
