    "in recent years , micro and nanomanipulation of single biological macromolecules has become feasible due to a dramatic improvement of experimental techniques . by using devices such as optical tweezers @xcite , soft microneedles @xcite and atomic force microscopes @xcite",
    ", it is now possible to access physical and mechanical properties of fundamental biological objects , namely proteins , nucleic acids , and molecular motors , on the scale of individual molecules .",
    "special effort has been devoted to the measurement of force - elongation characteristics of double stranded dna molecules ( dsdna ) , determining its response to external forces and torques in the absence of enzymes .",
    "the _ mechanical unzipping _ of dsdna structure by a force pulling the end of one of the two strands , the end of the other strand being anchored to some physical support , has been studied by bockelmann _",
    "et al._@xcite , who have measured the average force along the opening of the two strands .",
    "mechanical forces are in fact exerted on the dna molecule by different enzymes during the process of dna replication or transcription @xcite . on the other hand , the double helical structure of dsdna may be disrupted in vitro by changing ph , solvent conditions and/or temperature @xcite .",
    "this transition is known as _ melting denaturation _ , and it has been long studied by theoretical physicists @xcite . instead",
    ", only very recently dna mechanical denaturation has been the subject of theoretical studies .",
    "most of these studies have considered so far a simple extension of the poland - sheraga model @xcite , in which the two dna strands are homogeneous ideal polymer chains interacting with each other , introducing a constant force pulling apart the two strands by acting on one extremity of both strands . by using a mapping into a quantum mechanical problem ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the opening of the two strands occurs only if the pulling force is increased to a critical value .",
    "the unzipping transition turns out to be a first order phase transition , whereas the melting transition is second order , in the ideal case , in @xmath1 ( recently both simulations and exact results have shown that the melting transition becomes first order , when considering mutually self - avoiding walks ( saws ) @xcite ) .",
    "the heterogeneous case has also been studied with similar techniques @xcite . very recently ,",
    "monte carlo simulations of interacting pairs of self avoiding walks on a cubic lattice and of bead - and - string chains in the continuum space have determined the whole phase diagram in the force - temperature plane , revealing the existence of a re - entrant zipping - unzipping transition by decreasing the temperature for a finite range of forces @xcite .    in this paper , we obtain exact analytical results for a class of simple lattice models of interacting pairs of homogeneous directed self - avoiding walks .",
    "we extend the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in @xmath2 to the generic dimension case @xmath3 , and analyze both the scaling behavior of the first order unzipping transition and the multicritical scaling laws at the melting transition in the force - temperature plane .",
    "we also consider different versions of the model depending on whether the crossing of the two walks is allowed or not , or simply penalized by an entropy cost . in all cases , we find that the critical pulling force _ increases _ with temperature at low @xmath4 , implying thus the existence of a _ cold _ unzipping transition @xcite .",
    "this seemingly paradoxical property is due to the competition between the energy gained by increasing the open portion of dna and the entropy lost with the full stretching of the separated strands .",
    "cold unzipping will be exactly proved for both ideal and self - avoiding chains in the lattice , and for a discrete chain with constant distance between consecutive beads in the continuum space .",
    "we also discuss the role of denatured _ bubbles _ forming in dsdna opening , as opposed to the end - opening of the strands induced by the pulling force . by comparing the phase diagram of the different models considered , we point out that the approximation of neglecting bubbles and considering only y - shaped configurations shares many of the features of a mean - field type approximation , with an upper critical dimension @xmath5 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce the models of directed walks on the lattice in any dimension @xmath6 and compute their thermodynamical properties , deriving the phase diagram in the force - temperature plane . in sec.iii",
    "we analyze the scaling laws at both the thermal melting and mechanical unzipping transition , and we highlight the features that are physically more interesting in our exact results ( namely the existence of a re - entrant cold unzipping transition , our main result , and the role of forbidding the mutual crossing of the two strands ) . in sec.iva we discuss the physical meaning of re - entrance in our ( lattice ) models , generalizing the proof of its occurrence to the more realistic case of saws . in sec.ivb",
    "we prove that also a discrete chain in the continuum _ space _ undergoes cold unzipping , and then argue why such an effect had not been observed in previous calculations @xcite , performed in the limit of a continuum _ chain_. eventually , we discuss some related models ( with generic saws ) and give some additional technical details in the appendices .",
    "we consider a simple class of models in a @xmath3 dimensional hypercubic lattice @xmath7 .",
    "the two strands of a homogeneous dna molecule with @xmath8 base pairs are mimicked by two saws , directed along the @xmath9 direction .",
    "the two chains have one end in common , while at the other end a force @xmath10 is pulling in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "the walks gain a binding energy @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) every time the bases with the same monomer index ( or same projection upon @xmath9 ) interact , i.e. _ wrong base pairing _ is forbidden .",
    "the canonical partition function for two @xmath8-step directed self avoiding walks ( dsaws ) is :    [ 1 ] z_n(,g)=_xp_n(x,)(gx ) , where @xmath14 is the canonical partition function of two directed interacting strands whose last base pairs are at relative distance @xmath15 .",
    "the following recursion relation holds for @xmath14 :    [ 2 ] p_n+1(x,)=_i , j=1^d p_n(x - e_i + e_j,)(1+(()-1)_x,0 ) , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are the canonical euclidean versors of the @xmath6-dimensional space and @xmath18 is the kronecker delta .    these and similar equations have been intensively studied , at @xmath19 , within simple models of dna thermal melting @xcite , and , in @xmath20 , within the context of random walk adsorption @xcite and wetting problems @xcite .",
    "note that the choice of the @xmath9 direction along which the walks are directed , is crucial in allowing us to write local recursion relations .",
    "it is thus no surprise that the model belongs to the same universality class of random walks in @xmath21 dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , that , in the absence of a pulling force , within the model defined by equation ( [ 2 ] ) , dsdna undergoes a phase transition between a low temperature double stranded phase and a high temperature denaturated state only for @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) : in @xmath24 dsdna remains double stranded at all temperatures .",
    "however , we note that in ( [ 2 ] ) the two strands are allowed to cross each other , without any restriction .",
    "this seems rather unphysical , since every real chain has a finite `` hard core '' distance .",
    "thus , one should consider also the case in which crossing between different strands is forbidden ( recent studies of both homogeneous @xcite and heterogeneous @xcite dna melting transition have indeed considered the @xmath25 case with forbidden crossing ) .",
    "let us focus for the moment on the @xmath20 case , with no pulling force , where the effect of forbidding crossing is most dramatic . here",
    ", the direction @xmath26 can be identified as `` time '' , and its normal @xmath27 as `` space '' ( @xmath28 ) . the model with crossing ( w.c . )",
    "implies no restriction on the relative distance @xmath28 , whereas the one without crossing ( w.o.c . )",
    "implies that @xmath28 can not change sign , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath29 .",
    "the model w.o.c .",
    "is equivalent to surface adsorption models previously considered @xcite . while the thermal melting of the two strands w.c",
    ". takes place at @xmath30 , in the model w.o.c . @xmath31 as it can be deduced from ref.@xcite . to elucidate this point further ,",
    "we have tackled an intermediate model , where we do not forbid crossing , but we make it disadvantageous , by assigning a cost @xmath32 each time the strands pass through one another . with calculations similar to those reported below , we find that melting takes place at the critical temperature ( as a function of @xmath33 ) :    [ 3 ] t_c(v ) = [()]^-1 . as expected , as @xmath34 , equation ( [ 3 ] ) yields @xmath35 , whereas @xmath36 as @xmath37 .    to implement the non - crossing constraint in the model in generic dimension",
    ", we require that , if the dsaws join , one coming from direction @xmath38 and the other from direction @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 ) , when they divide again , they can not both proceed along their previous direction ; i.e we forbid that the first walk goes along direction @xmath16 _ and _ the second one along @xmath39 .",
    "this excludes one configuration out of @xmath41 at the splitting point ( the remaining @xmath6 possibilities would lead to the zipping of the two strands ) . as regards the @xmath42 thermal melting , again the model w.c .",
    "has @xmath30 , while , if crossing is forbidden as described above , the critical temperature is @xmath43 .",
    "this result was also found in a similar calculation by rubin @xcite . for @xmath22 the models with and without crossing both undergo a denaturation transition at a finite , though different , critical temperature , so that the effect of forbidding crossing here is less important ( the critical temperatures are the same at the leading order @xmath44 in the @xmath45 expansion , as expected ) .",
    "let us now turn to the models with the pulling force @xmath46 in generic dimension @xmath6 , with @xmath47 .",
    "we can find the asymptotic value of the canonical partition function ( [ 1 ] ) by locating @xcite the singularity closest to the origin of its generating function :    [ gp ] z(z,,g)=_n=0^z^n _ x p_n(x , ) ( g x ) ,    which we will also refer to as the grand partition function .",
    "we stress that @xmath14 is a generic partition function : its detailed form will depend on whether or not we allow crossing .    to proceed ,",
    "it is useful to partition the dna molecule in ds helices ( with the strands attached to each other ) and _ bubbles _ , sequences in which the two chains share just the first and the last base pairs ; we also single out the contribution of the unzipped end of the two dsaws , _",
    "i.e. _ the part from the last contact to the end . in this way",
    ", the grand partition sum ( [ gp ] ) can be expressed as :    [ conv ] z(z,,g)= s(z , g ) , where we have defined :    [ def1 ] b(z ) = _ n=2^z^nb_n , s(z , g)= 1+_n=1^z^n _ x [c_n-1(x ) - c_n-1(0)_x,0 ] ( g x ) . in ( [ def1 ] ) , @xmath48 is the number of @xmath49-step bubbles , and @xmath50 the partition function of two @xmath8-step dsaws never touching each other and having their last sites at a mutual distance @xmath15 , and their initial sites at a relative distance @xmath51 for some @xmath52 . by summing over all possibilities for initial conditions ( see equation ( [ sc ] ) below ) , @xmath53 ,",
    "so that we need to find an explicit expression for the @xmath54 s .",
    "the equations they obey are : [ recrel ] c_n+1(x ) = _ i , j=1^d c_n(x - e_i + e_j)- c_n(0)_ij;i , j=1^d _ x , e_i - e_j .",
    "notice that in eq.([recrel ] ) @xmath55 acts as a sink or absorbing state , _",
    "i.e. _ once the two walks join , they never leave . in this way , @xmath50 with @xmath56 counts the number of pairs of walks that never touch each other ( and with the last monomers at a relative distance @xmath15 ) , while @xmath57 counts the number of remaining pairs of walks that at some point come into contact and then remain stuck together .",
    "this last quantity plays the role of an arbitrary constant and has to be subtracted away from the final counting as in ( [ def1 ] ) ( see @xcite for another example in which this prescription was used in a @xmath42 example ) .    in order to simplify the presentation from now on",
    "we restrict our calculations on models w.o.c .",
    "( detailed calulations for this case and the outline of calculations for the simpler models w.c . are deferred to appendix a ) .",

    "the first singularity @xmath61 is leading to the usual random walk behavior in the absence of any interaction .",
    "the second singularity @xmath62 is a function of the strength of the attractive interaction between the two strands , determining thus the behaviour in the native zipped phase . at @xmath63 , the critical temperature for thermal melting",

    "a third new singularity , depending on the external force , and fundamental in our calculations arises when computing : [ s_sing ] s_sing(z , g)_[-,]^d ( z , q ) _ x , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are given in eqs .",

    "case is different from the w.o.c .",
    "this is enough of course to make the whole phase diagram different for the two kinds of models , as will be discussed in section iii .",
    "we stress here that the main interest in using directed walks is that they are a sub - class of saws in the same dimension .",

    "the phase diagram , as found also in @xcite , explicitly reads ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : [ pdwoc ] g_c(t,)=^-1 [-1 ] . the model exhibits a first - order `` unzipping '' transition if we move at a fixed value of @xmath101 , as shown in ( [ fe ] ) . as is shown in fig .",

    "the exact expressions for @xmath106 and for @xmath96 can be found by inverse laplace transforms of the quantities @xmath111 , @xmath112,@xmath113 .",
    "however , if we only need scaling relations in the thermodynamic limit , we can use the discrete tauberian theorem ( see @xcite and appendix b ) , which relates the critical behaviour of a series to the asymptotic behaviour of its coefficients . by using this method , we find , in the vicinity of the unzipping mechanical transition : [ new2 ] & & < n > ~ , + [ new3 ] & & < x_g > ~- , where @xmath114 are determined in such a way that @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath107 , and @xmath117 for the two crossover exponents , consistently with the fact that the unzipping transition is first - order ( the explicit form of @xmath114 is worked out in appendix b ) . note that @xmath118 , whereas @xmath119 is negative in the re - entrant part of the transition curve .",
    "the scaling functions @xmath120 behave in a similar way to @xmath109 , and thus we get that @xmath121 and @xmath122 are both extensive at the transition point .",
    "the physical interpretation is that a macroscopic portion of the chain is still in the double stranded state , but the rest of the chain is unzipped ; these are just the two phases coexisting at the first order transition .",
    "this result will be used later to justify the use of y - shaped configurations .",
    "it is instructive to compare this phase diagram with that of the same @xmath20-case when we allow crossing . the transition line ( plotted in fig .",
    "2 ) , obtained from @xmath123 ( see appendix a ) is : [ pdwc ] g_c(t , ) = t ^-1[1- ] = + [2- ] , both the models behave similarly near @xmath124 , namely they yield a transition to the _ cold denaturated _ state described in @xcite . when we move at a constant force @xmath92 such that @xmath125 $ ] , at low enough temperatures the molecule is unzipped , and it zips by increasing @xmath4 .",
    "this feature of the phase diagrams seems at first sight paradoxical , since one would expect the critical force to decrease monotonically as the temperature is increased .",
    "the physical explanation of this result will be given below .",
    "in the model w.c .",
    ", moreover , @xmath126 always increases , approaching @xmath91 as @xmath127 , and the two strands remain zipped for every temperature when @xmath128 . in the model w.o.c .",
    ", instead , the two strands unzip again by further increasing the temperature .",
    "as regards scaling , on the other hand , the two models are identical so that we can say that the effect of forbidding crossing is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense , but has a dramatic effect on the form of the critical line .",
    "let us now discuss the results that we have obtained in higher dimensions ( the critical lines for three and four dimensional models are shown in fig .",
    "common to all models is the cold unzipping transition found in the @xmath20 case .",
    "moreover , the scaling laws at the unzipping transition do not depend on dimensionality in the crossover exponents . on the other hand",
    ", the thermal melting has dimensionality - dependent critical exponents ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the behaviour of the critical line @xmath97 near the end point @xmath129 also depends on @xmath6 . as @xmath130",
    "the result that we find in generic dimension is : [ endpoint ]    ~\\ {    ll /t",
    "-/t_c(d ) & + [- ] & + [/t -/t_c(d)]^1/2[]^-1/2 & + [/t -/t_c(d)]^1/2 &    .    , where @xmath131 is a constant , and @xmath30 in @xmath24 for models w.c .",
    "to obtain some physical insight into our analytical results , we compute the free energy of a y - shaped molecule of dna with a force pulling at the extremities ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . in this way , we neglect all the configurations with _",
    "bubbles_. such an approximation is valid at low t and yields the exact result in the limit @xmath132 .",
    "since the configurations of the unzipped part are weighted by @xmath133 , in this limit only the completely stretched configuration will contribute to the free energy for the unzipped part of the y. in the limit of low temperature , the free energy is then : [ reentrance ] f(m , n ) ~-(n - m)(+ t ) -2gm , where @xmath134 is the number of monomers in the unzipped part , @xmath8 is the total number of bases and @xmath135 is the connective constant of a single walk .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ reentrance ] ) ( with @xmath136 ) is valid also in the case of two self - avoiding walks ( saws ) , since the connective constant of saws constrained to avoid the fully stretched unzipped part , is the same as for ordinary saws @xcite ( for a more detailed discussion on saws we refer to appendix c ) . by minimizing with respect to @xmath134",
    ", we find the critical force @xmath97 such that ( [ reentrance ] ) is minimum for @xmath137 when @xmath138 , and for @xmath139 when @xmath140 : [ reentrance1 ] g_c(t,)(+ t ) .",
    "this is indeed what we have found in our calculations , and confirms that re - entrance is a robust feature of lattice models , not depending on dimensionality or self - avoidance . in other words , ( [ reentrance1 ] ) means that , at low @xmath4 , it is more difficult to open a dsdna helix as @xmath4 is increased , because the energy gain obtained through the unzipping is more than compensated by the entropy loss , since there is only one possible completely stretched configuration versus @xmath141 possibilities for the double stranded portion of the chain ( we will see in the following section that the entropy loss in the continuum space exhibits a power law correction ) . for high enough @xmath4 , on the other hand , also other configurations will contribute to the open portion , increasing its entropy , and the energy gain will eventually favour the unzipped state , except that in @xmath20 w.c . , where the presence of bubble enhances the entropy of the native portion at any @xmath4 , as explained below .",
    "we have also calculated the phase diagram obtained by considering only the y configuration : this amounts to putting the generating function for bubbles @xmath142 in ( [ conv ] ) .",
    "as expected , the y - approximation gives the exact behaviour ( [ reentrance1 ] ) in the limit @xmath143 , whereas it gets wronger and wronger as @xmath4 is increased ( see fig .",
    "2 where we plot the two - dimensional case explicitly given by @xmath144 $ ] ) . for the critical line near the melting point ,",
    "this approximation yields @xmath145 for all @xmath6 , which from ( [ endpoint ] ) is correct only for @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "this is because such an approach neglects bubbles , which are expected to be more and more relevant as @xmath148 decreases ( for @xmath149 once the two walks have splitted away , they basically never meet again ) and @xmath4 increases . in this view , it is clear that the puzzling behaviour found in the @xmath20 model with crossing , where @xmath126 increases for all @xmath4 , is due to the growing presence of bubbles : before dna can be unzipped , we have to disentangle all the bubbles that are forming , which is harder and harder as @xmath150 .",
    "we now prove that also discrete chains in the continuum space undergo a cold denaturation for @xmath143 .",
    "let us consider two @xmath8-monomer chains in @xmath151 with no constraint on the directedness , with a force @xmath10 pulling at the extremities and with constant unitary distance between consecutive monomers .",
    "as @xmath152 , bubbles can be neglected and only y - shaped configurations contribute to the partition sum . the partition function for a y - configuration then reads : [ part ] z_n(,g)=_m=0^n-1z_n - m^z()z_2m^u(g ) , where @xmath153 is the partition function of the zipped portion of the strands , and @xmath154 is that of the unzipped end .",
    "chain discreteness is crucial in ensuring the validity of eq.([part ] ) for @xmath152 , since when one bubble has formed , the length of the stretched portion of the chain can be at most @xmath155 .",
    "the integrals in ( [ part ] ) can be performed in any dimensions , and the evaluation of @xmath156 involves the modified bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath157 . in particular , @xmath158 , and there is a power - law correction with respect to the lattice result .",
    "we find that @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the surface area of the unit sphere in @xmath148 dimensions . from this , the critical force",
    "is easily found : [ continuum ] g_c(t,)-t- , where @xmath161 is the euler gamma function .",
    "the critical line @xmath97 increases at low @xmath4 and re - entrance is present also in the continuum , even enhanced with respect to the lattice case .",
    "the leading term @xmath162 in equation ( [ continuum ] ) ( due to the power - law correction in @xmath163 is indeed not present in the @xmath25 case , when one correctly recovers equation ( [ reentrance1 ] ) for a lattice random walk with @xmath164 .",
    "we finally wish to discuss the relation of the present treatment with previous work ( @xcite ) done on the unzipping of homo - dna in the limit of a continuum chain .",
    "the ds molecule with the pulling force had been described by means of an effective hamiltonian , which , apart from an irrelevant center of mass term , reads :    [ eff_ham _ ] h=_0^n dn(()^2 + v(r(n))-g ) ,    where @xmath165 is the relative separation between the strands , @xmath166 is the effective kuhn length of single - stranded dna and @xmath33 is a realistic short range attractive potential , namely a delta function or a potential well ( the two cases should be equivalent according to the standard quantum theory as long as @xmath167 is the same ) . the system described by ( [ eff_ham _ ] ) is equivalently represented by a quantum system with a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "one finds @xcite that there is a first order unzipping transition when the force reaches the critical value :    [ critical_force ] g_c(t,)= ,    where @xmath168 is the ground state energy of the quantum hamiltonian obtained from ( [ eff_ham _ ] ) when @xmath169 . in the quantum mechanical system , for @xmath138",
    "the ground state is a bound state , while for @xmath140 the spectrum of ( [ eff_ham _ ] ) is continuous .",
    "let us focus on the @xmath25 case , corresponding to our two - dimensional models without crossing constraints .",
    "it is well known that at @xmath105 both a symmetric square well and a delta function always have at least one bound state , meaning that dna remains ds at all @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "5 we show the critical force for the two potentials ( obtained simply from ( [ critical_force ] ) ) . it can be seen from the figure that at high @xmath4 both the potentials saturate towards the same limit , as in our calculation for the model w.c .",
    "this is expected since the delta potential case can be recovered from our equation ( [ 2 ] ) in the limit of both continuum space and time ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . at low @xmath4 ,",
    "however , @xmath170 for a square well of width @xmath171 , and is constant for the delta potential , so that re - entrance is present only in the former case , but with a behaviour different from that found in the lattice .",
    "this already signals that the low temperature behaviour of the solution obtained through the quantum mapping is rather unphysical .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the limit of continuum chain the chain constraint is modelled in a ` soft ' way , by using a harmonic potential between consecutive beads along the chain .",
    "this interaction is usually assumed to be entropic ( as in eq .",
    "( [ eff_ham _ ] ) ) and thus effectively vanishes at @xmath124 . in that limit eq .",
    "( [ eff_ham _ ] ) is describing a set of @xmath8 ` free ' particles moving in an effective potential determined by @xmath33 and @xmath92 .",
    "consequently , the quantum mapping is expected to describe the system well except in the low temperature limit .",
    "indeed , the re - entrance found for the square well potential is due to the unboundedness of the potential felt by the `` free particles '' as soon as @xmath89 . as @xmath143",
    ", fluctuations are not important , and the particles stay close to the minimum of such potential , which is @xmath172 for a force whatever small but finite .",
    "this is enough to unzip the strands @xcite .",
    "as zhou has observed in @xcite , one can improve this model by placing a hard core either inside the potential well or at a finite distance from the delta ( this is analogous in spirit to introducing the crossing constraint in our lattice models ) .",
    "once again , one finds that for t near @xmath173 , which is now finite , both potentials predict @xmath174 as in the lattice model ( see eq.([endpoint ] ) ) , whereas for low @xmath4 the delta shows no re - entrance and the potential well displays a @xmath175 behaviour .",
    "we note once again that the low temperature behavior of such ` quantum ' models is an artifact , when considered as polymer chain models , due to the ` soft ' enforcing of the chain constraint . in this respect ,",
    "discrete chain models in the continuum space are more realistic , either with constant bond length or with harmonic springs between consecutive beads . in the first case we have indeed proved ( see eq .",
    "( [ continuum ] ) ) the existence of cold mechanical denaturation . in the second case",
    "it has been shown to occur by means of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we have studied simple models for dna mechanical unzipping induced by a pulling force . by using analytical techniques , the relevance of forbidding the crossing of the two strands and the role played by bubble formation in the denaturation process has been discussed throughout the whole force - temperature plane .",
    "the scaling properties of the system along the transition line have also been determined .",
    "the existence of a _ cold mechanical denaturation _ for a finite range of forces at low enough temperatures has been exactly proved in a general case for both lattice and continuum space models .",
    "the fundamental role of chain discreteness has been emphasized in comparison with related models studied by means of quantum mapping techniques .",
    "even if we neglected many important effects , such as base pairs heterogeneity , intrinsic helicity , wrong base pairing , and different stacking energy for the natured and denatured state , it would be interesting to experimentally test this prediction stemming from such a simple model .",
    "furthermore , on the basis of preliminary results ( analytical and numerical ) we anticipate that even in the presence of _ quenched _ randomness in the contact potential our models display a re - entrant transition , so in this sense it is really a `` universal '' feature .    _",
