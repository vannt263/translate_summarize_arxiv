    "as the number of extragalactic cepheids discovered with _ hst _ continues to increase and the value of @xmath3 is sought from distances based on these variables ( e.g. saha et al .",
    "1999 ; mould et al .",
    "2000 ) , it becomes even more important to understand various possible systematic errors which could affect the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "currently , the most important systematic is a bias in the distance to the large magellanic cloud , which provides the zero - point calibration for the cepheid distance scale .",
    "the lmc distance is very likely significantly shorter than usually assumed ( e.g. udalski 1998 ; stanek et al .",
    "2000 ) , but it still might be considered uncertain at the @xmath4% percent level ( e.g. jha et al .",
    "another possible systematic , the metallicity dependence of the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation , is also very much an open issue , with the empirical determinations ranging from 0 to @xmath5 ( freedman & madore 1990 ; sasselov et al .",
    "1997 ; kochanek  1997 ; kennicutt et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "in this paper we investigate a much neglected systematic , that of the influence of blended stellar images on the derived cepheid distances .",
    "although cepheids are very bright , @xmath6 at a period of @xmath7 , their images when viewed in distant galaxies are likely to be blended with other nearby , relatively bright stars .",
    "we define _ blending _ as the close projected association of a cepheid with one or more intrinsically luminous stars , which can not be detected within the observed point - spread function ( psf ) by the photometric analysis ( e.g. , daophot , dophot ) .",
    "such blended stars are mostly other young stars which are physically associated @xmath1 from actual binary and multiple systems to companions which are not gravitationally bound to the cepheid .",
    "blending is thus a phenomenon different from _ crowding _ or _ confusion noise _ ; the latter occurs in stellar fields with a crowded and complex background due to the random superposition of stars of different luminosity . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with blending due to wide unbound systems .",
    "binary cepheid companions are well studied ( evans 1992 ) , and do not contribute enough flux to affect cepheid distances ( madore 1977 ) , due to the obvious constraints of coeval stellar evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the association of cepheids with other luminous stars in wide unbound systems is an unsolved problem in general .",
    "while such association , i.e. a strong star - star correlation function , is expected and common to young stars ( harris & zaritsky 1999 ) , the specific case for cepheids is unknown . studies in our galaxy are very difficult due to the small sample and existing results , though tantalizing , are inconclusive ( evans & udalski 1994 ) .",
    "this could explain the relative neglect of this issue in recent years , but blending had been of concern for early studies of magellanic cloud cepheids ( deyoreo & karp 1979 ; pel , van genderen & lub 1981 ) , because even faint b - star blends affect the optical colors of a cepheid significantly .",
    "we investigate the effects of stellar blending on the cepheid distance scale by studying two local group spiral galaxies , m31 and m33 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on m31 ( andromeda galaxy ) , located at approximately @xmath8 ( e.g. holland 1998 ; stanek & garnavich 1998 ) from us . as part of the direct project ( e.g. kaluzny et al .",
    "1998 ; stanek et al .  1998 ) we have collected for this galaxy an extensive data set , finding among other variables 206 cepheids .",
    "we identify some of these cepheids on archival _ hst_-wfpc2 images and compare them to our ground - based data to estimate the impact of blending on our photometry , taking advantage of their superior resolution ",
    "the fwhm on the wfpc2 camera corresponds to @xmath9 at the distance of m31 , compared to @xmath10 for the ground - based data .",
    "the average fwhm on the direct project ground - based images of m31 is about @xmath11 , or @xmath10 , which corresponds to the _ hst_-wfpc2 resolution of @xmath12 for a galaxy at a distance of @xmath2 .",
    "any luminous star ( or several of them ) in a volume of that cross section through the disk ( at the inclination of the galaxy ) could be indistinguishable from the cepheid and would contribute to its measured flux .",
    "as cepheids are relatively young stars , they reside strictly in the midplanes of the disks of spiral galaxies .    the archival _",
    "hst_-wfpc2 study of m31 cepheids from our project direct was undertaken to improve our distance determination to the galaxy .",
    "the preliminary indirect ( via lmc ) cepheid distance we obtained ( kaluzny et al . 1998 ; sasselov et al .",
    "1998 ) was practically the same as the cepheid distance by freedman & madore ( 1990 ) of @xmath13 .",
    "our findings of blending now indicate that these distance estimates should be corrected upward .",
    "we describe the ground - based and _ hst _ data and the applied reduction procedures in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss the task of identifying cepheids on _ hst _ wfpc2 images . in section 4 we present the blending catalog of cepheids and discuss it in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we describe the effect of blending on the light and color curves of cepheids and how these curves can be used to detect blends . in section 7",
    "we discuss the effectiveness of some of the blend analysis methods encountered in the literature .",
    "the concluding remarks are to be found in section 8 .",
    "the ground - based data were obtained as part of the direct project between september 1996 and october 1997 during 95 full / partial nights on the f. l. whipple observatory 1.2  m telescope and 36 full nights on the michigan - dartmouth - mit 1.3  m telescope .",
    "six @xmath14 fields with a scale of 0.32 /pixel were monitored : four of them ( a  d ) concentrated on the rich spiral arm in the northeast part of m31 , one ( e ) close to the bulge of m31 and one ( f ) containing the giant star formation region known as ngc 206 .",

    "the standard pipeline calibration is fully described in the _ hst _ data handbook .",
    "the first two steps in our reduction procedure were to mark the bad pixels on the images and to compensate for the fact that pixels on the edges and corners of the ccd receive fewer photons due to the geometric distortion in the wfpc2 optics .",
    "for each image a mask was created from the data quality file retrieved from the archive and a vignetting mask generated by stetson ( 1998 ) and then used to mark bad pixels and vignetted regions . to restore the integrity of the flux measurements",
    "the images were multiplied by a pixel - area map , originally created by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and renormalized to the median pixel area on each chip by stetson ( 1998 ) .",
    "these tasks were accomplished under iraf .    in the next step of the reduction procedure pairs ( or multiplets ) of images",
    "were selected , taken in the same filters , having identical center coordinates as well as similar exposure times .",
    "the * crrej * task under iraf was used to combine the images and remove cosmic rays . when multiple images for a given field were not available , single images were used for photometry .",
    "the photometry was extracted by means of the daophot / allstar package ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) .",
    "stars were identified using the find subroutine and aperture photometry was done on them with the phot subroutine .",
    "we used the point - spread functions ( psf ) derived individually for each filter and chip of the wfpc2 camera , kindly provided to us by p.  b.  stetson ( private communication ) to obtain the allstar profile photometry . after the initial allstar run , find was ran again on the star subtracted images , to identify stars that were missed on the first pass .",
    "aperture photometry was obtained for them with phot , followed by profile photometry with allstar .",
    "the two star lists were merged and used as input to allstar to obtain the final photometry .",
    "it should be noted that the _ hst _ photometry has not been calibrated to any standard system and therefore instrumental magnitudes are used throughout this paper .",
    "this has , however , no bearing on the results presented in this paper , since they are strictly based on differential photometry .",
    "the preliminary identification of direct cepheids on the _ hst _ frames was accomplished by a visual comparison of the _ hst _ data matched via world coordinate system ( wcs ) information to our ground - based @xmath0 template image for each field , using saoimage ds9 .",
    "the wcs information for the ground - based template image header was obtained with a program written by mink ( 1997 ; 1999 ) by matching stars from the image to the usno a2.0 catalog stars ( monet et al .",
    "1996 ) . we have matched a total of 22 cepheids to _ hst _ data : six in our field b , four in c ( two of them on two different overlapping fields ) and 12 in field f ( one found on two different fields ) .",
    "this constitutes @xmath20 of the 125 cepheids in fields b , c and f.    in some cases , when a cepheid which appeared to be a single star on the @xmath0 template was resolved into multiple stars on an _ hst _ image , it was difficult to distinguish which star was the cepheid on the basis of the template image alone .",

    "the image in the upper right panel was taken with the pc chip of the wfpc2 camera while the one in the lower right panel comes from a wf chip .",
    "the inset has different iraf z - scale limits to show the two blended stars separately .",
    "the circles , centered on the cepheids , have a radius of @xmath22 .",
    "the cepheid v4125 d31f is shown in the upper panels of the figure [ fig : cfig ] .",
    "on the ground - based template it appears as a single star , while on the pc chip it is resolved into two objects , one 3 magnitudes dimmer than the other .",
    "a third star appears below and to the right , just outside the circle , fainter by almost 2 magnitudes from the brighter component of the doublet . that star was not identified on the ground - based template image , but after subtracting the cepheid a brighter spot is visible at that location .",
    "the lower panels show the case of v2203 d31f , where the cepheid , appearing as a single star on the ground @xmath0 template image , is resolved by _ hst _ into two stars , differing by one magnitude in brightness .",
    "to help confirm the cepheid nature of the selected objects , instrumental color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) were constructed from _ hst _",
    "data , whenever photometry in two bands was available .",
    "a few representative cmds are shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , ( @xmath23 ) in the left panels and ( @xmath24 ) in the right panels .",
    "the cepheids are denoted by circles and their companions by squares .",
    "stars from the same chip are plotted in the background for reference .",
    "the upper left panel shows a case where there is a substantial contribution of flux from a red giant companion ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) which is seen at a distance of @xmath27 from the cepheid v1893 d31f .",
    "the other companion is a blue star at a distance of @xmath28 which appears to be located at the red edge of the main sequence ( also in the @xmath29 cmd which is not shown ) .",
    "the lower left panel presents a case where the cepheid v2203 d31f has a luminous blue main sequence companion with @xmath30 and @xmath31 which are separated by @xmath32 .",
    "the upper right panel shows the cepheid v7184 d31b with two blue main sequence companions , the more luminous one , located @xmath28 away , contributing @xmath33 as much light as the cepheid in the @xmath34 band and @xmath35 in @xmath0 . a typical situation where none of the companions ( in this case one ) had @xmath36-band photometry ( see table [ tab : cep ] )",
    "is illustrated in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : cmd ] , where the cepheid v4954 d31b is shown .",
    "the criterion for blending was determined empirically , by careful examination of ground - based and _ hst _ data for the same cepheids .",
    "we consider a star to be blended with the cepheid if it is located at a distance of less than @xmath22 from it and is not detected by daophot in our ground - based images .",
    "the choice of maximum distance was motivated by the typical full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) in our ground - based images ( @xmath37 ) .    due to the relatively small number of cepheids having _ hst _ data , it was deemed worthwhile to examine them on the _ hst _ images in detail to see whether all of the companions had been identified by daophot and to check for the possibility of false detections ( cosmic rays in case of single images , bad columns , etc . ) . in the latter case",
    "the object was removed from the list .",
    "not much could be done in the former case , although that proved not to be a problem and only in a few of the 55 examined images there were very faint companions which eluded detection .",
    "it must be noted that the fwhm of the psf on the wf chip is of the order of 1 pixel and so the probability of the detection of a faint star may depend on the way its light is distributed over the pixels .",
    "one exception , however , is v1893 d31f , which daophot failed to recognize as a star on one of the single f606w filter images , along with its companion 2 pixels ( @xmath27 ) away .",
    "no problem was encountered on the other three combined images .",
    "we estimate that our data is fairly complete for companions contributing at least @xmath38 of the flux of the cepheid in the v band ( filters f555w and f606w ) .",
    "we have used this somewhat arbitrary cutoff in evaluating the sum @xmath39 of all flux contributions in filter @xmath40 normalized to the flux of the cepheid : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the flux of the i - th companion , @xmath43 the flux of the cepheid on the _ hst _ image and @xmath44 the total number of companions . in table",

    ", the instrumental surface brightness values were converted to mag / using 12 - 17 fairly bright isolated reference stars with known standard magnitudes by means of the following formula : @xmath50 = m_{ref } + 2.5 \\log   ( s^2 i_{ref } / i_{sb})\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the flux in adu/  pixel and the corresponding magnitude of the reference star , @xmath53 is the surface brightness expressed in adu/  pixel and @xmath54 is the pixel scale of the chip .",
    "the @xmath55 scatter around the value of the average ranged from 0.025 to 0.061 mag/.    in order to give these numbers some perspective , we have computed surface brightness around cepheids in two galaxies which straddle their range , ngc 2541 and ngc 4535 ( fig . [",
    "fig : sky_sv_cmp ] ) .",
    "we find that the cepheids we discover in m31 reside in environments of surface brightness typical of spiral galaxies , despite the high inclination of m31 .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "data for these galaxies , observed as part of the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale ( ferrarese et al .",
    "1998 , macri et al . 1999 ) , were obtained from the hubble data archive . since we were unable to estimate the sky level for those images , we tried to choose epochs where the sky level would be the lowest .",
    "we chose the 1995 nov 20 epoch for ngc 3541 and the 1996 may 24 epoch for ngc 4535 .",
    "the surface brightness values were computed using the same method as for our m31 cepheids and were re - expressed in units of mag / using the zeropoints provided in the hst data handbook .",
    "before attempting to draw any far - reaching conclusions from figs .  [",
    "fig : hist]-[fig : sky_sv_cmp ] or the catalog itself ( tab .",
    "[ tab : cep ] ) , we must stress that they are based on a fairly small sample of cepheids and therefore subject to statistical uncertainties .",
    "an illustration of this effect is the small number of counts in the second bin of the combined histogram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] ) , compared to the third and , especially , the first bin , which could be an artifact of small number statistics .",
    "an encouraging fact is that the distributions in separate fields , especially b and f , appear to be similar to a substantial degree in their overall shape and spanned range of @xmath47 . in the combined histogram there is a decreasing trend in the number of cases @xmath46 with increasing flux contribution from blending , @xmath47 .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : vfv ] conveys some of the information contained in the previous figure  a lack of cases with @xmath56 is readily apparent , which , as mentioned above , is believed to result from the fairly small size of the sample .",
    "if we attribute the gap to statistical effects , then cepheids fainter than @xmath57 appear to populate a wide range of @xmath47 , from 0 up to approximately 0.35 , with one object at @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that in none of the fields do cepheids show a tendency to favor any particular value of @xmath47 , as also apparent from figure  [ fig : hist ]",
    ".    another striking feature of the diagram is that all of the three cepheids brighter than @xmath57 have @xmath59 , although it has to be emphasized that this sample is much too small to draw any definite conclusions .",
    "one possible explanation may be ventured , however , which may hold true in these particular cases , but does not have to be the rule for the whole population of bright cepheids .",
    "the most luminous cepheids are the most massive ones and , hence , the youngest .",
    "the group or association of stars in which they had formed will have had less time to disperse .",
    "this may manifest itself in a somewhat higher spatial density of stars and thus would increase the probability of blending .",
    "figure [ fig : sky_sv ] shows the blending parameter @xmath47 of the m31 cepheids as a function of the local surface brightness . as there is a gap at @xmath60 , the separation into blended ( @xmath61 ) and unblended cepheids ( @xmath62 ) is readily discernible in the diagram .",
    "no correlation between the blending parameter @xmath47 and the underlying surface brightness is apparent .    to put the surface brightness values around the m31 cepheids into perspective , we plot the surface brightness values computed for the ngc 4535 and ngc 2541 cepheids ( fig . [",
    "fig : sky_sv_cmp ] ) .",
    "the range of surface brightness of ngc 2541 falls below the range of our m31 cepheids .",
    "there is a 26% overlap between the ngc 4535 and m31 data  13 out of the 50 cepheids in ngc 4535 are located in regions with surface brightness in the range covered by our m31 cepheids .",
    "it should be kept in mind that our sample may also be affected to some extent by selection effects : for example , 11 of our cepheids are located in the vicinity of ngc 206 , the giant star - forming region in m31 .",
    "additionally , m31 is observed at a rather high inclination angle , which is not a typical situation for most galaxies searched for cepheids .",
    "an opportunity to study the effects of blending with a larger sample of @xmath63 cepheids , in a more face - on system , will present itself in the next paper on cepheids in m33 ( mochejska et al .",
    "we will also discuss there the influence of blending on the observed colors of cepheids .",
    "the luminosity variations through the pulsation cycle of a cepheid seen in the optical are due primarily to changes in temperature .",
    "the monochromatic surface brightness changes with temperature and is additionally quite dependent on wavelength .",
    "of course , the cepheid also expands and contracts @xmath1 its area varies .",
    "this contributes to the total light variation in a wavelength independent way .",
    "the radius variation in a typical cepheid is out of phase by about 90@xmath64 with respect to the surface brightness variation .",
    "therefore a comparison between color ( proxy for temperature variation ) and magnitude ( proxy for luminosity variation , due to _ both _ radius and temperature change ) would produce a loop in the cmd plane .",
    "these loops , i.e. the tight correlation between color and luminosity , have had a limited use in the past as part of the cepheid plc calibration ( fernie 1964 ) , or to transform away the temperature - induced variation ( madore 1985 ; moffett & barnes 1986 ) .",
    "the characterization of cepheid companions had been traditionally done by using the similar loops in the color - color plane of optical bands ( stobie 1970 ) .",
    "the color - color loop arises from the phase shift introduced between the pair of color - magnitude relations when a companion of different temperature ( i.e. color ) is added .",
    "blue or red companions distort the color - color loops in very different and quantifiable ways ( madore 1977 ; deyoreo & karp 1979 ) and can be very effective in deriving the amount of and color of contamination in a cepheids flux .    in order to understand the wavelength - dependent effect of a blue or red companion on the light curves ( and loops ) of a cepheid , one should bear in mind that the contaminant flux is most prominent during the minimum in the cepheid lightcurve , and gradually becomes insignificant as the cepheid brightens up during its cycle .",
    "the addition of a _ red companion _ to the flux of a cepheid has the following effects on its optical light curves : ( 1 ) the light curve exhibits a flatter minimum ( due to the added flux ) ; ( 2 ) the color curve has a deeper minimum ( due to the added red flux ) ; and ( 3 ) the asymmetry in the color curve decreases .",
    "the addition of a _ blue companion _ to the flux of a cepheid has the following effects on its optical light curves : ( 1 ) the light curve exhibits a flatter minimum ( as above ) ; ( 2 ) the color curve has a flatter minimum ( due to the added blue flux ) ; and ( 3 ) the asymmetry in the color curve increases .",
    "a typical example is the cepheid v7184 d31b ( paper i ) , which has blue blends ( table 2 ) and whose cm loop is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : blend ] .",
    "the effect on its loop is predictable given the above discussion : as the cepheid fades and becomes naturally redder , the added constant blue flux of the blends becomes more prominent and diverts the lower part of the loop to the blue ( left in fig .",
    "[ fig : blend ] ) .",
    "this diversion could result eventually in a complete reversion of the naturally clockwise trajectory of the loop .",
    "if the data is incomplete ( there are two gaps in the light curves of v7184 ) , the blue blending is still detectable by the steeper slope of the loop .    these changes on the color - magnitude plane , together with a fit of the mean colors of the cepheid to extinction laws ,",
    "can be a powerful means to find and characterize blended cepheids in a sample like our direct project one .",
    "the necessary requirement is @xmath1 good , well - sampled light curves in at least two bands .",
    "therefore we were able to find blended cepheids like v7184 in m31b and exclude them from our analysis without the benefit of _ hst _ images , but just using our light curves ( paper i ) .",
    "however , the technique is limited to the cases with strongest blending  a nonlinear fitting routine by rebel ( 1998 ) applied to the m31b data",
    "still did not detect 2/3 of the blended cepheids we found in this paper .",
    "in other words , the naive technique of visual inspection for `` flat - bottom '' light curves is completely inadequate for detecting 10%-20% cepheid blending , which is dominating our findings in m31 .",
    "the influence of blending has been largely neglected in many recent galaxy distance determinations based on cepheids .",
    "few attempts have been made to deal with this problem .",
    "on one of the galaxies observed by the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale , ngc 2541 ( ferrarese et al .  1998 ) , several criteria were used to reject cepheids which may suffer from crowding .",
    "we have applied them to our sample of 22 cepheids to estimate their effectiveness in detecting blending . as we discussed already in  1 , blending and crowding are different phenomena , and judging from  5 they do not seem much correlated in m31 either , but it would be helpful if these criteria could detect blending .",
    "one of the proposed tests ( ferrarese et al .  1998 ) involves identifying cepheids that have companions not resolved by profile photometry programs by looking at their photometric errors .",
    "the underlying idea is that the photometric error would be higher than in case of an isolated star of the same magnitude due to a poorer psf fit resulting from the unresolved companion .",
    "we have constructed diagrams showing the allstar photometric error @xmath65 as a function of the allstar @xmath0 magnitude , similar to the one presented in fig .",
    "8 of ferrarese et al .",
    "the diagram for field f is shown in figure [ fig : als2 ] .",
    "the cepheids are plotted as solid dots surrounded by circles with their size proportional to the amount of blending @xmath47 ( no outside circle means @xmath66 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 magnitudes and the errors are taken from the field f template image ( fwhm@xmath21 ) , as are the stars plotted in the background .    upon examining figure [ fig : als2 ] it is apparent that the photometric errors @xmath65 do not show a correlation with the amount of light coming from companions @xmath47 .",
    "one such case is v2320 d31f which is an unblended star with an error almost twice as large than most stars of similar magnitude .",
    "another example is v3289 d31f with @xmath67 , which has a photometric error larger than two other , more blended cepheids of similar @xmath0 magnitude : v1549 d31f with @xmath68 and v3550 d31f with @xmath69 .",
    "most of the cepheids lie within the most densely populated areas of the diagram , with v2320 d31f and v2203 d31f being the most clear outliers . a similar photometric error distribution , uncorrelated with @xmath47 , is also seen in fields b and c. in conclusion , the presence of close companions did not manifest itself in the form of a poorer psf fit and , hence , a larger photometric error in the studied sample .",
    "another fact which should be kept in mind is that our ground - based psf is much better sampled than the _ hst _ psf ( comparing to the respective fwhms ) , thus it should be more sensitive to any deformations resulting from the superposition of two or more stars .",
    "another proposed method of rejecting blended cepheids is to remove all stars having companions contributing more than @xmath70 of the total light within a radius of two pixels .",
    "taking into account the fact that the two pixels on the _ hst _ wf chips correspond to twice the fwhm , we have conducted a similar test on our ground - based @xmath0 template data for the cepheids .",
    "only one of our cepheids , v5646 d31b with @xmath71 would be rejected from our sample on the basis of this criterion .",
    "this test also failed to identify the blended cepheids in our sample .",
    "a third proposed test for blending is to check if the cepheid lies on the instability strip in the cmd .",
    "the usual color range spanned by the final sample of cepheids discovered with _",
    "hst _ is about one magnitude , for example @xmath72 in ngc 2541 ( ferrarese et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath73 in ngc 4639 ( saha et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath74 in ngc 4535 ( macri et al .",
    "the examination of a ground - based cmd for the 12 field f cepheids yields a @xmath75 color span of also about one magnitude ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "no clear correlation of the color with the @xmath47 of the cepheid is seen in the diagram , as unblended cepheids also exhibit a large color scatter , from @xmath77 for v2320 d31f to 1.59 for v3860 d31f , most likely due to differential reddening .    in the case of our sample of 22 cepheids , the tests were not successful in rejecting the blends .",
    "these tests may be helpful in some cases of blending , when the two stars are almost resolved or when the companion has a larger flux contribution than the maximum value of @xmath69 present in our sample .",
    "but a contamination of @xmath69 has a large impact on the photometry of the cepheid , which actually would be dimmer by almost one third from the measured brightness .",
    "for our sample of 22 cepheids with both ground - based and _ hst _ data , we find that the mean @xmath0-band flux contribution from companions unresolved in the ground - based images , @xmath78 , is about @xmath79 of the flux of the cepheid , while the median @xmath47 is 12% .",
    "this shows that blending could potentially be a substantial source of error in the cepheid distance scale , as the distance derived from our ground - based photometry for this admittedly small cepheid sample would be systematically underestimated by @xmath80 ( for the mean @xmath47 ) or @xmath81 ( for the median @xmath47 ) .",
    "this is to be compared to the current cepheid distance to m31 ( which is subject to the lmc distance uncertainty ) of @xmath13 ( freedman & madore 1990 ; kaluzny et al .",
    "1998 ; sasselov et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the cepheid photometry by freedman & madore ( 1990 ) was from the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( average seeing 1.0 , freedman , wilson , & madore 1991 ) .",
    "our findings of blending here require that these distance estimates to m31 be corrected upward by about 9% .",
    "blending becomes even more severe when we consider galaxies at a distance of @xmath82 , i.e. at the edge of what can be currently observed with _",
    "the @xmath12 fwhm on the wf chips of the wfpc2 camera would span a linear distance of @xmath83 in such a galaxy , which corresponds to @xmath84 at the distance of m31 . in order to obtain an estimate as to the degree of contamination caused by blending at a distance of @xmath82",
    ", we have summed the contributions of all cepheid companions within a diameter of @xmath84 in our _ hst _ data for m31 .",
    "the result is presented in figure [ fig : ks ] in the form of a cumulative probability distribution of @xmath47 .",
    "the diagram shows that @xmath70 of our cepheids have @xmath85 , though some of the cepheids with a very high degree of contamination would probably elude detection .",
    "this indicates that blending will very likely introduce a significant contamination to cepheid photometry at such distances and resolution .    as the result of blending with other unresolved stars ,",
    "the cepheids appear brighter than they really are when observed in distant galaxies with _ hst_. as we compare them with mostly unblended lmc cepheids , this leads to systematically low distances to galaxies observed with the _ hst _ , and therefore to systematically high estimates of @xmath3 .",
    "the sign of the blending effect on the @xmath3 is opposite to that caused by the lower lmc distance ( e.g. udalski 1998 ; stanek et al .",
    "2000 ) and might be of comparable value , as discussed in this paper .",
    "it should be stressed that blending is a factor which contributes in only one direction , and therefore it will not average out when a large sample of galaxies is considered .    one obvious solution to the problem of blending would be to obtain data with better resolution .",
    "such an opportunity will be available after the launch of the next generation space telescope , scheduled for 2008 .",
    "an alternative approach would be to determine the amount and color of flux contamination for the cepheids by the analysis of their light curves and/or color - color loops .",
    "the requirement , however , is to have good quality , well - sampled light curves in at least two bands , which is not the case for _ hst _ cepheids .",
    "however , even with our good light curves it is difficult to detect cepheids with blending of @xmath86 .",
    "it must be stressed that the images taken with the _ hst _ wfpc2 camera , despite having a resolution @xmath87 times better than our ground - based images ( fwhm @xmath88 vs. @xmath89 ) , will still leave some blends unresolved , including physical companions ( e.g. evans 1992 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-band flux contribution from cepheid companions derived in this paper sets only the lower limit on the true influence of blending on the cepheid photometry ."
