    "the cornerstone of current theories of structure formation in the universe is the dominance of a non  baryonic dark matter component . during the last decade",
    "the standard cold dark matter ( hereafter scdm ) scenario has shown a high predictive power in explaining many observed properties of the large  scale galaxy distribution : the constituents of dark matter in this model are massive particles , which decoupled when non relativistic or have never been in thermal equilibrium ; the primordial perturbations are assumed to be gaussian and adiabatic with a scale  invariant power  spectrum , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 ( the so  called harrison ",
    "zeldovich spectral index ) ; the scdm scenario is also characterized by an einstein  de sitter universe with vanishing cosmological constant . the amplitude of the primordial perturbations is usually parametrised by the linear _ bias _ factor @xmath2 , defined as the inverse of the _ rms _ mass fluctuation on a sharp  edged sphere of radius @xmath3 mpc ( in this work we will adopt the value @xmath4 for the hubble constant @xmath5 in units of @xmath6 km @xmath7 ) .",
    "the _ cobe _",
    "dmr detection of large angular scale anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( smoot et al 1992 ; bennett et al .",
    "1994 ) can be used to fix the normalization of the model , leading to @xmath8 .",
    "this normalization makes the model completely specified .",
    "however , it is well known that this model presents some serious problems , mostly due to the high ratio of small to large  scale power : in particular , the _ cobe _ normalization implies excessive velocity dispersion on mpc scale ( e.g. gelb & bertschinger 1994 ) and is unable to reproduce the slope of the galaxy angular correlation function obtained from the apm survey ( maddox et al .",
    "1990 ) .    to overcome these difficulties many alternatives to this basic model",
    "have been proposed : @xmath9  tilted \" ( i.e. @xmath10 ) cdm models ( vittorio , matarrese & lucchin 1988 ; adams et al .",
    "1992 ; cen et al .",
    "1992 ; lucchin , matarrese & mollerach 1992 ; tormen et al . 1993 , moscardini et al . 1994 ) , @xmath11 hybrid ( i.e. hot plus cold ) dark matter models ( e.g. klypin et al . 1993 , and references therein ) , @xmath12 cdm models with a relic cosmological constant ( e.g. efstathiou , bond & white 1992 , and references therein ) , @xmath13 non ",
    "gaussian cdm models ( hereafter ngcdm ; moscardini et al . 1991 ; messina et al .",
    "1992 ) .    in the present work we consider the last alternative .",
    "physical motivations for this class of models can be given in terms of the effect of relic topological defects ( e.g. scherrer & bertschinger 1991 ; scherrer 1992 , and references therein ) , or in terms of the inflationary dynamics of models containing multiple scalar fields ( see e.g. salopek 1992 ) , or in the frame of the cosmic explosion scenario ( e.g. weinberg , ostriker & dekel 1989 ) .",
    "ngcdm models have been investigated in a series of papers ( moscardini et al .",
    "1991 ; matarrese et al . 1992 ; messina et al . 1992 ; coles et al .",
    "1993a , b ; moscardini et al .",
    "1993 ; borgani et al .",
    "1994 ) , mainly devoted to the analysis of the clustering properties of the matter distribution on large scales , as resulting from n  body simulations .",
    "a similar analysis was done by weinberg & cole ( 1992 ) , who , however , performed numerical simulations with scale  free initial power  spectra",
    "of course , the ultimate probe of the non  gaussian character of the primordial perturbation field can only be obtained from the analysis of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies on large angular scales : a number of statistical tests have been recently proposed in order to detect possible non ",
    "gaussian signatures , such as the skewness of the temperature distribution ( hinshaw et al .",
    "1994 ) and the genus of iso  temperature contours ( smoot et al .",
    "the analyses performed on the first year _ cobe _",
    "data have revealed that non ",
    "gaussian signals are not present on the angular scales probed by the dmr experiment ( @xmath14 ) , beyond those due to the effects of the cosmic variance ( e.g. scaramella & vittorio 1991 ) .",
    "the implication of this result is that non ",
    "gaussian features can not be relevant for the large  scale gravitational potential , so , either the primordial fluctuations were indeed gaussian , or primordial non ",
    "random phases were only present on scales below @xmath15 , as it seems the case for anisotropies generated by topological defects ( e.g. coulson et al . 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , for the models we consider here , we just have to require that the gravitational potential was significantly non ",
    "gaussian already at redshifts of order of a tenth , when we start to evolve our system , and up to scales as large as @xmath16 mpc ( much below the _ cobe _ scale ) , as probed by our simulations .",
    "this work is devoted to a detailed study of the velocity field in n ",
    "body simulations of ngcdm models , and to a comparison of the large  scale velocity field of a composite sample of optically selected galaxies ( 1184 galaxies , with known radial peculiar velocities , grouped in 704 objects , from the  mark ii \" compilation ) , with that obtained from the simulations .",
    "in particular , we calculate the probability to reproduce the observed properties of the local group and the observed values for the bulk flow , the velocity correlation function , and the cosmic mach number of the data in mock catalogues extracted from our simulations .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed by tormen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and moscardini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in the frame of open and/or tilted cdm models .",
    "contrary to most previous analyses of ngcdm models ( moscardini et al . 1991 ; messina et al .",
    "1992 ) , we here fix the ` present time ' of the simulations in such a way that the linear bias parameter @xmath2 is one , consistently with the _ cobe _ normalization . ] . the same choice for the normalization has been made by moscardini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , where the effect of primordial non  random phases on the large  scale behaviour of the galaxy angular two  point function has been investigated : it was found that models with initially negatively skewed fluctuations are in principle capable of reconciling the lack of large  scale power of the cdm spectrum with the observed clustering of apm galaxies .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce our skewed cdm models . in section 3",
    "we discuss the general properties of the velocity field of the simulations , analysing the bulk flow , the one  point velocity dispersion and the cosmic mach number at different smoothing scales .",
    "we also analyse the density and velocity probability distributions and power  spectra .",
    "section 4 is instead devoted to the statistical comparison of mock catalogues extracted from the simulations with observational data .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "the non  gaussian statistics considered here are those adopted by moscardini et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , namely the _ lognormal _ ( hereafter @xmath17 ) and the _ chi  squared _ with one degree of freedom ( hereafter @xmath18 ) , chosen as distributions for the peculiar gravitational potential , @xmath19 , before the modulation by the cdm transfer function .",
    "these distributions actually split in two different types of models : the _ positive _ ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) and _ negative _ ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) models , according to whether the sign of the skewness for linear mass fluctuations , @xmath24 , is positive or negative respectively .",
    "all our model distributions are set up in such a way that @xmath25 has the  standard \" cdm power  spectrum @xmath26^{-2 } , \\eqno(2.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a suitable normalization constant and the cdm transfer function @xmath28 is taken from davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) for a flat universe .",
    "this choice for the spectrum allows us to make a direct comparison with the gaussian cdm ( hereafter @xmath29 ) model .",
    "we use a particle  mesh code with @xmath30 particles on @xmath31 grid  points . the box ",
    "size is @xmath32 mpc .",
    "we run two independent simulations for each of the five considered models .",
    "the primordial gravitational potential is obtained by the convolution of a real function @xmath33 with a random field @xmath34 , @xmath35 the field @xmath36 is obtained by a non  linear transformation on a zero  mean gaussian process @xmath37 , with unit variance and power  spectrum @xmath38 ; the function @xmath39 is fixed by its fourier transform , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a positive correction factor which we applied to get the exact cdm initial power ",
    "spectrum of eq.(2.1 ) .",
    "the non  linear transformations from @xmath37 to @xmath36 is @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively ( coles & barrow 1987 ; coles & jones 1991 ; moscardini et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the clustering dynamics and the present large ",
    "scale structure have been shown ( moscardini et al .",
    "1991 ) to strongly depend upon the sign of the primordial skewness : positive models rapidly cluster to a lumpy structure with small coherence length , while negative models build up a cellular structure by the slow merging of shells around primordial voids .",
    "the velocity field of ngcdm models has not received as detailed a study as its gaussian counterpart ; a preliminary analysis was done by moscardini et al .",
    "for this reason , before comparing the observed cosmic velocity field with the prediction of our models , we would like to briefly discuss the role of primordial density skewness on velocity field statistics . in this section",
    "we will compute some general statistics in the idealized situation of a perfect knowledge of the three  dimensional velocity field .",
    "we will carry out our analysis on the four skewed models ( positive and negative @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , plus the gaussian model .",
    "for each model we will analyse the velocity field defined on a @xmath44 mesh .",
    "the field is obtained using the same procedure as in kofman et al .",
    "first we interpolated mass and momentum from the particle distribution on a regular cubic grid by means of a triangular shaped cloud ( tsc ) scheme ( see hockney & eastwood 1981 ) .",
    "we then smoothed the result using a further gaussian filter , to define the velocity field also in underdense or empty regions of the simulations .",
    "the gaussian window had a radius of @xmath45 km s@xmath46 , close to the dynamical resolution of the simulations . finally , the velocity at a grid ",
    "point was defined as the local ratio of momentum and mass density .",
    "since the normalization criteria of the simulations here analysed differ from those used in the previous papers , we will also present the density distribution function and power  spectrum as auxiliary tools for our analysis .    due to the fact that the velocity field is quite sensitive to long wavelength fluctuations , following strauss , cen & ostriker ( 1993 ) , we included in our simulations the effect of waves larger than the box size .",
    "to do so we added to the velocity of each particle the linear _",
    "rms _ bulk velocity of a cube of 260 h@xmath46 mpc , the size of our simulations .",
    "the direction of the bulk velocity was chosen at random for each simulation .",
    "the value of such a bulk flow , approximately 220 km s@xmath46 , was calculated for the gaussian cdm model ; however , being a linear correction , we could safely apply it also to the non  gaussian simulations .    in figures 1a and 1b",
    "we plot the projected particle positions and the smoothed peculiar velocity taken from a slice of depth @xmath47 mpc , for the lognormal and chi  squared models respectively .",
    "a comparison with a similar plot for the gaussian model is possible looking to figure 1b in moscardini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , where the same scale and normalization for the velocity field was used .",
    "even if the times here considered are different , a first glance confirms previous results .",
    "the longer time evolution amplifies the properties of skew  positive models : a lumpy structure , with isolated knots surrounded by large regions of quasi  uniform density . on the contrary",
    ", the shorter evolution does not completely prevent the skew  negative models from displaying their cellular structure with long filaments , extended sheets and large voids .",
    "figure 2 shows for our models the density fluctuation probability distribution ( left panel ) , its power  spectrum ( central panel ) and the velocity modulus @xmath48 distribution function ( right panel ) . in table 1",
    "we report also the first and second moment of the velocity distributions and the second moment of the density fluctuation distributions .",
    "one can see that time evolution has preserved the memory of the primordial skewness of the density field in all simulations .",
    "in fact , negatively skewed models show a larger number of voids and underdense regions , and develop fewer non  linear overdensities than the positively skewed models do .",
    "the bump shown in the density histogram at @xmath49 points out the action of gravity on the initial underdensities .",
    "the gaussian model exhibits an intermediate behaviour , with a larger number of moderate overdensities but a shorter tail on the right .",
    "this is also confirmed by the values listed in table 1 .",
    "the density power ",
    "spectra are given in the second panel of figure 2 .",
    "the fast decay of the curves at high @xmath50 is due to the smoothing introduced by the tsc interpolation used to define the density field on a regular cubic grid .",
    "the primordial phase correlation present in the skewed models has caused non  linear effects also on the scale of the box .",
    "in fact , in the skew  positive models some power has been transferred from long to short wavelengths ; this is another way to say that these models have more non  linear structure at small scales .",
    "the skew  negative ones show instead a general lower amplitude for the power  spectrum : the  cross talk \" between modes has slowed down the growth rate for @xmath51 at all scales . recalling that velocities are sensitive to large scale power and looking at @xmath51 we may expect to find a higher mean velocity for the gaussian model , longer tails of very high velocities ( due to small scale non ",
    "linear structures ) for the positively skewed models and in general lower velocities for the negatively skewed models .",
    "the velocity distributions are in fact different from one another .",
    "the gaussian model has the largest _",
    "rms _ velocity of all , whereas the skew  positive ones have a larger number of very high velocities .",
    "the difference is statistically significant : after our smoothing , in the skew  positive models there are , for example , nearly 2000 grid ",
    "points with a velocity greater than 2000 km s@xmath46 , whereas the gaussian distribution has no grid point with such a high velocity . as for the negative models , while the @xmath23 indeed has low velocities ( it is the model with the least non  linear structure of all ) , the @xmath22 exhibits a singular behaviour , with a tail of high velocities as the positive models have : a possible explanation of this tail is the gravitational `` push '' from voids and underdense regions , which are larger and more extreme in this model than in the @xmath23 .",
    ".moments of probability distribution functions . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have analysed the large  scale velocity field in the context of non  gaussian cdm models .",
    "weinberg & cole ( 1992 ) partially analysed the properties of peculiar velocities in their non  gaussian models , assuming scale  free initial conditions .",
    "our work presents the first detailed study of large  scale motions as resulting from primordial non ",
    "random phases in a cdm scenario .    unlike previous analyses on the same models , mostly devoted to the study of the matter distribution and its clustering properties , in this work we found that the sign of the primordial skewness of the density field provides a poor discriminatory power .",
    "all our non  gaussian models tend to have lower velocity dispersion and bulk flow than the standard gaussian cdm model .",
    "we interpret this as due to the effect of primordial phase correlation which , in skew  positive models , causes power to be transferred from large scales ( important for velocities ) to small scales , whereas in skew  negative models it causes a general slowing down of the growth of the power  spectrum at all scales .",
    "this result is different to our earlier findings due to the different normalization here applied , which is dictated by the _ cobe _",
    "data , i.e. @xmath52 .    in particular , this choice does not allow our skew  negative models to fully develop their dynamical properties , discovered in previous studies , where it was found that only after a lengthy evolution these models could achieve the right slope for the correlation function , assumed to indicate the  present time \" . these non  gaussian models , therefore , only experience moderate non  linear evolution ( as shown by the low value of @xmath53 in table 1 ) , which makes their large  scale velocity field still sensitive to the initial conditions ( i.e. to the cdm power  spectrum ) and only marginally dependent , through mildly non  linear effects , on its primordial kurtosis and on the skewness of the density fluctuations .",
    "this very fact implies that the comparison of our non  gaussian models with observational data does not clearly permit to single out a best model : the standard gaussian model is marginally preferred by the maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "moreover , these results suggest that , contrary to naive expectations , primordial non  random phases do not help in producing large  scale bulk motions such as those indicated by the lauer & postman ( 1994 ) analysis , which is one of the most challenging observational results for the present structure formation scenarios .",
