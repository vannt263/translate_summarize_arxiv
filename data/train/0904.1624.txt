    "squeezed light is a kind of radiation exhibiting reduced fluctuations with respect to vacuum in some special observable .",
    "this occurs at the obvious expense of an increase in the fluctuations of its canonical pair , as followed by the heisenberg uncertainty relation satisfied by the couple . in a single mode field",
    "these canonically related observables correspond to orthogonal field quadratures , which are equivalent to the position and momentum of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "squeezing is a macroscopic manifestation of quantum phenomena that is attracting continuous attention since the late seventies of the past century @xcite . nowadays",
    "a renewed interest has arised because of the importance of squeezing in generating continuous variable entanglement , which is a central issue for continuous variable quantum information purposes @xcite .",
    "squeezed light is generated by means of nonlinear optical processes , such as parametric down  conversion or four  wave mixing .",
    "the squeezing level attainable in such nonlinear optical processes depends on the interaction time that is limited by the nonlinear medium length .",
    "thus in order to increase the squeezing level , these processes are usually confined to occur within an optical cavity . in this way",
    "the squeezing level can reach the largest possible levels at the system bifurcation points such as , e.g. , at the emission threshold . squeezing levels as large as 90% ( 10db reduction respect to vacuum fluctuations )",
    "have been recently reported @xcite in such conditions in degenerate optical parametric oscillators ( dopos ) .",
    "however perfect squeezing ( i.e. , the complete suppression of quantum fluctuations in a field observable )  can not be achieved in these conditions because complete suppression of fluctuations in a mode quadrature implies the existence of infinite fluctuations in the other quadrature , what would require infinite energy in the process .    nevertheless perfect squeezing",
    "could be actually produced and we have recently proposed a way for obtaining it @xcite . the idea can be put in short as follows . consider a nonlinear optical process in which two photons with equal frequency are generated , each photon corresponding to @xmath4 orbital angular momentum ( oam ) laguerre  gauss mode .",
    "this is equivalent to generating two photons in a tem@xmath5 hermite ",
    "gauss mode whose orientation in the transverse x - y plane is determined by the phase difference between the two laguerre  gauss photons , let us denote it by @xmath6",
    ". now assume that @xmath6 is not fixed as it occurs , e.g. , in a down  conversion process .",
    "this amounts to saying that the orientation of the hermite ",
    "gauss mode is not fixed as @xmath6 is the angle formed by the hermite ",
    "gauss mode with respect to the x - axis .",
    "in these conditions we can expect the occurrence of arbitrarily large fluctuations in the hermite ",
    "gauss mode orientation , which suggests that the canonical pair of @xmath6 , namely the angular momentum @xmath7 , could be perfectly fixed .",
    "but the angular momentum of a tem@xmath5 mode forming an angle @xmath6 with respect to the x - axis is another tem@xmath5 mode forming an angle @xmath8 with respect to the x - axis .",
    "then this mode could exhibit perfect squeezing in one of its field quadratures .",
    "notice that the concept of bifurcation is not involved in this discussion and that the variable exhibiting arbitrary fluctuations is an angle .",
    "then , a priori , perfect squeezing is possible in such a process as `` infinite '' fluctuations are possible in the fluctuations of @xmath6 .    in refs",
    "@xcite we have recently theoretically demonstrated the above ideas in a model of dopo tuned to the first transverse family at the down - converted frequency .",
    "the requirement that the angle @xmath6 can take any possible value ( i.e. that the phase difference between the two laguerre ",
    "gauss modes be arbitrary ) is nothing but the requirement that the system be rotationally invariant around the optical cavity axis .",
    "hence the resulting squeezing can be understood too as the result of the spontaneous breaking of this rotational symmetry , as the emitted hermite ",
    "gauss mode is obviously no more rotationally invariant . in @xcite",
    "we extended this study to dopos having different transverse families resonating at the down - converted frequency , arriving to the same conclusion : every time the nonlinear process generates light which breaks the rotational invariance of the system , the expected perfectly squeezed observable is found .",
    "f1.eps + figure 1.- scheme of the system .",
    "a @xmath9 medium is confined within an optical cavity and pumped by two gaussian beams of frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the cavity tuning is such that two signal modes with frequency @xmath10 are generated .",
    "the two signal modes are degenerated in frequency but differ in the spatial mode , one ( the other ) corresponding to a laguerre  gauss mode with orbital angular momentum @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .    in the present paper we present a model for a @xmath9nonlinear cavity in which squeezing appears as the result of the rotational symmetry breaking .",
    "the interest of this new proposal is twofold . on one hand",
    "it allows us to demonstrate that rotational symmetry breaking is a robust means for generating squeezing in the sense that is not limited to a @xmath13nonlinear cavity such as the dopo . on the other hand",
    "perfect rotational invariance could be problematic to achieve in @xmath13 systems because phase  matching requirements could imply the tilting of the nonlinear crystal thus compromising rotational invariance , a difficulty that disappears in a @xmath9 process because phase  matching occurs easily in this case .",
    "the type of @xmath9nonlinear cavity system we are proposing here is a novel one that has not been studied previously , as far as we know .",
    "hence we must derive the quantum model ( section ii ) as well as study its classical emission properties ( section iii ) before addressing its quantum properties ( section iv ) .",
    "we are able to demonstrate that the proposed device effectively exhibits perfect squeezing originating in the rotational symmetry breaking . in section",
    "v we resume our main results .",
    "consider an optical cavity with spherical mirrors containing an isotropic @xmath9 medium .",
    "the cavity is pumped from the outside with two coherent fields of frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 , these pumping beams having a gaussian transverse profile .",
    "suppose , for simplicity , that these pumping beams have the frequencies and shapes corresponding to two consecutive longitudinal modes of the optical cavity .",
    "then , within the cavity the nonlinear interaction generates , through a four  wave mixing ( fwm ) process , two other fields having the same frequency @xmath14 such that @xmath15 . assume now that the cavity geometry and tuning is such that these two signal fields have the shape of first order laguerre ",
    "gauss modes .",
    "these modes carry oam and its conservation imposes that one of the signal fields carries positive oam with @xmath11 while the other carries negative oam with @xmath12 as the pumping fields have zero oam ( see fig .",
    "as stated , the just described fwm process requires that the optical cavity modes , as well as the fields frequencies , be properly chosen .",
    "an immediate choice that verifies the previous requirements is a confocal resonator . in this type of cavity the resonance frequency of longitudinal mode @xmath16 corresponding to the transverse family @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the radial index )",
    "is given by @xcite@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the effective cavity length .",
    "in this case , the pumping beams can correspond to two consecutive longitudinal modes with @xmath21 .",
    "the signal modes would then correspond to the cavity modes with indices @xmath16 and @xmath22 , as they verify @xmath23 .",
    "certainly , in the confocal resonator there are other modes with frequency @xmath14 ( an infinite number indeed ) having larger odd angular momenta and belonging to other families .",
    "however we can neglect them by considering that these higher order laguerre ",
    "gauss modes could have larger cavity losses ( what is true for low fresnel number cavities ) and would consequently not be amplified .",
    "once we have shown that the fwm process we propose could be experimentally implemented , we pass to formulate the mathematical model of our system",
    ".      we shall assume for simplicity that the @xmath9 crystal is placed at the cavity s waist plane and that is thin enough as to perform the uniform field approximation , hence neglecting any dependence of the fields on the axial coordinate @xmath24 .",
    "thus we write the total quantum field inside the cavity , at the beam waist ,  as    [ quantum - field]@xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for hermitian conjugate ; @xmath27 is the position vector in the transverse plane written in polar coordinates ; subindices @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote pump and signal modes , respectively ; @xmath30 , with @xmath31 ; and @xmath32 is the refractive index ( we neglect dispersion for simplicity ) .",
    "the slowly varying amplitudes are    [ envolventl]@xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the annihilation and creation operators for mode @xmath36 , which verify @xmath37   = \\delta_{mn}$ ] . as for the spatial dependence in ( [ envolventl ] ) ,",
    "they are given by @xcite    @xmath38    for the gaussian and first order laguerre ",
    "gauss modes , respectively . in all cases",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "notice however that in the optical domain , in which @xmath41 , one can safely take @xmath42 as far as @xmath20 is not very small , which implies that the waist is very nearly the same for all of the involved modes .",
    "we make this approximation that , although not essential , simplifies some expressions below .    for later use",
    "we need the relation between the laguerre  gauss modes and the hermite  gauss modes    [ hs]@xmath43 being @xmath44 and @xmath45 the hermite  gauss modes with an orientation @xmath46 and @xmath47 with respect to the axis , respectively .",
    "thus the slowly varying amplitudes at frequency @xmath48 can also be written as    @xmath49    with    [ ac , as]@xmath50 the annihilation operators for the hermite - gauss modes .",
    "finally , we introduce the field quadratures of these hermite ",
    "gauss modes    @xmath51    with @xmath52 and @xmath53 given by eqs .",
    "( [ ac , as ] ) .      in the interaction picture ,",
    "the system s hamiltonian can be written as@xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 correspond to the modes energies and external injection , respectively , and are given by    @xmath57    with @xmath58 the cavity detuning for the mode with frequency @xmath59 , being @xmath60 the cavity resonance closest to that mode . in a confocal resonator this detuning is the same for all the modes if the relative frequency of the pump modes is locked to the free spectral range of the cavity , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "hence , in the following we take @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 are the pumping parameters , which are related to the experimental parameters by    @xmath66 being @xmath67 the transmission factor at the considered frequency and @xmath68 the power of the pumped laser . in the following",
    "we will assume @xmath69 for simplicity .",
    "@xmath70 describes the nonlinear interaction and can be written as the sum of three contributions @xmath71 with@xmath72 describing self  phase modulation , cross  phase modulation , and four  wave mixing , respectively .",
    "note that this hamiltonian contains all the possible combinations of four operators conserving both energy and oam .",
    "the factors multiplying the different terms are intuitive once one takes into account the two following features : ( i ) ,  there is a global factor 4 in @xmath73 and @xmath74 with respect to @xmath75 coming from all possible permutations of the different operators ; and ( ii ) , if any of the four modes is a signal mode , a factor 1/2 appears that comes from the transverse modes overlapping integral .",
    "finally , it can be shown that the coupling constant is given by@xmath76 with @xmath77 the beam waist , @xmath78 the crystal length and @xmath79 the third - order nonlinear susceptibility of the crystal .      in this subsection",
    "we apply the standard procedure to develop the quantum theory of a nonlinear resonator within the generalized @xmath80 representation to our kerr cavity model @xcite .",

    "( [ alan ] ) and",
    "( [ dlan ] ) , ruling the evolution of the fields inside the cavity . however , the analysis of this model turns out to be quite involved .    a simpler model retaining the essential ingredients consists in neglecting the temporal evolution of the pumping fields , or further , considering the undepletion limit for the pump .",

    "gauss output mode in the transverse plane .",
    "hence , the null eigenvalue implies that the fluctuations introduced by quantum noise in this orientation are not damped and , hence , that quantum noise will induce arbitrary rotations of the hermite ",
    "gauss output mode in the transverse plane .",
    "thus the breaking of the rotational symmetry of the system introduced by the appearance of the hermite ",

    "on the other hand , the two other eigenvalues , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , are complex in general ; nevertheless , they reach the values @xmath177 and @xmath178 at the bifurcation points ( i.e. , at the points in the parameter space separating the regions where the steady state solution ( [ solon ] ) exist or not ) . consequently , their associated eigenvectors are those exhibiting the usual squeezing occurring only at the bifurcations .",
    "this squeezing is not perfect ( it seems perfect only owed to the linearized treatment ) and degrades quickly as the system parameters are brought apart from the bifurcation points .",
    "we shall not analyze this squeezing here because there is not any relevant new feature in it with respect to what has been described many times in other nonlinear optical cavities .",

    "then , although the mode orientation is well defined at every instant , it can be understood that the pattern orientation is undefined as after some time any value between @xmath177 and @xmath196 could be found .",
    "this is what we understand when we say that the orientation of the output pattern is undetermined .",

    "2 ) , @xmath202 .",
    "this is an intuitive result because when the output mode mean photon number is close to zero , the pattern orientation can be abruptly changed with the addition of a single couple of photons .",
    "as the system is brought apart from this bifurcation the mean number of photons rapidly increases and , consequently , it is more difficult for the fluctuation to change the orientation of the pattern , what is obviously consistent with the rapid decrease of @xmath203 . as for the quantitative value notice that , except very close to the supercritical bifurcations , @xmath203 is a quantity of order one what means that the diffusion constant @xmath204 is basically of the same order of magnitude as @xmath205 , which we have assumed to be a very small number .",

    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the values of @xmath18 where the nontrivial solution ceases to exist .",
    "now we focus on the main result of the present article : we show below that the dark mode has complete noise reduction on its phase quadrature irrespective of the system parameters . to this aim",
    "we evaluate its quadrature fluctuations as measured in an homodyne detection experiment .",
    "as it is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , quadrature fluctuations outside the cavity are given by the noise spectrum , which for a general problem quadrature @xmath207 ( @xmath208 refers to any of the transverse modes of our system ) is given by@xmath209 with @xmath210 the squeezing spectrum that , after taking into account our rescaling ( [ reescal ] ) , can be written as@xmath211 defined in this way ,",

    "the spatial profile of the local oscillator field ( lof ) selects the transverse mode to be measured , while its phase selects a particular mode s quadrature . in what follows",
    "we suppose that the lof is perfectly matched to the _ dark _ mode s profile @xmath215 . as we saw in ( [ xtoc ] ) ,",
    "the independent quadratures of this mode are @xmath216 and @xmath217 , from which we can build a general quadrature as@xmath218   .\\ ] ] this expression is readily obtained from the more common expressions @xmath219 and @xmath220 .    hence , by using the relation between the independent quadratures and the projections @xmath221 ( [ xtoc ] ) , and remembering eq . ( [ corrspec ] ) and that @xmath188 , it is trivial to find the noise spectrum of this general quadrature , which reads @xmath222 this expression shows that the quantum properties of the dark mode of the current system are exactly the same as that found in @xcite for the case of a dopo cavity : at @xmath223 , @xmath224 and thus it has complete absence of fluctuations on its phase quadrature ( @xmath225 ) , while another of its quadratures ( @xmath226 in our case ) carries only with vacuum fluctuations .",
    "any other quadrature having @xmath227 between @xmath228 and @xmath181 is squeezed below the vacuum level , though the squeezing level is smaller as @xmath227 approaches to @xmath181 .",
    "these results are independent of the system parameters , what we expected as the noise reduction relies on the rotational symmetry breaking only",
    ".    it could seem that this result violates the uncertainty principle , as the product of the noise spectra corresponding to two orthogonal quadratures is below unity .",
    "however , in @xcite , we have proven that this is actually not the case , as the canonical pair of the squeezed quadratures is not another quadrature , but the orientation of the dark mode @xmath143 , which is indeed undetermined in the long time term .",
    "we have proposed a model for a kerr cavity in which a spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking occurs when the system is beyond the emission threshold : the nonlinear cavity has a perfect rotational symmetry and is pumped by gaussian beams , but the emitted signal field has the shape of a tem@xmath5 mode that breaks the rotational symmetry .",
    "we have demonstrated in a special simple limit ( in which the pumping fields are taken as constants ) that the rotational symmetry breaking implies ( i )  the diffusion of the output mode orientation , and ( ii ) the perfect squeezing of the phase quadrature of the tem@xmath5 mode that is rotated @xmath228 with respect to the signal tem@xmath5 mode .",
    "these results are in perfect agreement with our previous proposal of the symmetry breaking mediated squeezing in a dopo  model @xcite .",
    "the interest of the results here presented are twofold . on one hand",
    ", we are proposing a system different to that of @xcite for the possible observation of the phenomenon , thus showing that the results in @xcite are quite general . on the other hand",
    ", rotational symmetry could be broken in a dopo  cavity if angular phase matching is necessary , as in this case the nonlinear crystal axis is rotated a certain angle with respect to the cavity axis , a problem that does not exist in the case of a @xmath229 nonlinear medium as phase matching is easier to obtain .",
    "as for the particular model we have proposed , in its formulation we have assumed a confocal cavity , as in this cavity type the required resonances are verified .",
    "notice however that the ingredients that are essential for the phenomenon of rotational symmetry breaking mediated squeezing generation are : ( i ) rotational invariance , and ( ii )  that the signal field photons have non  null oam .",
    "then , the dynamics of the pumping modes is irrelevant except for the quantitative details . in this sense",
    ", the use of a confocal cavity is not essential and any other @xmath9 cavity in which the signal modes are the right ones could exhibit the described phenomenon",
    ". then this phenomenon could possibly be observed in other @xmath229 cavities such as , e.g. , fiber ring resonators .",
    "another comment we would like to add concerns the non  pump depletion approximation . how would the dynamics of the pumping modes affect the results we have derived ?",
    "the inclusion of the pumping fields equations in the study would obviously introduce more eigenvalues ( the ones corresponding to the stability of these modes ) and would modify some of the eigenvalues governing the dynamics of the signal modes , but would not modify the existence of a goldstone mode once the signal field is switched on ( as it appears due to the symmetry breaking ) . hence as far as the dynamics of the pumping modes",
    "does not destroy completely the stability of the cw signal field emission , wherever the signal modes are stable the phenomenon will be present .",
    "it could well happen that the general model exhibits hopf bifurcations that would reduce the domain of stable existence of the cw signal modes , but there will be a finite domain of stability for these modes and within it there will be the perfect squeezing properties we have described in our work .",
    "we would finally stress two important features .",
    "in @xcite we demonstrated for a dopo  model that small imperfections in the rotational symmetry do not lead but to a small degradation of the squeezing level . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "we have numerically demonstrated for the same dopo  model that the rotational symmetry breaking mediated squeezing is perfect beyond the linear approximation .",
