    "accretion is one of the most important physical processes in astrophysics .",
    "it is widely accepted that the accreting matter toward the central object is a source of power active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and galactic x - ray sources ( see for a review e.g. frank et al .",
    "this idea is also well - applicable to interpret many observations of astrophysical phenomena , such as , prototype stellar objects ( chang & choi 2002 ) , symbiotic stars ( lee & park 1999 ) , gamma - ray bursts ( brown et al . 2000 ) .",
    "there are some types of accretion flows that a significant fraction of the generated heat by dissipation processes retains in the fluid rather than being radiated away , have been the subject of considerable attention in recent years ( ogilvie 1999 ; chang 2005 , akizuki & fukue 2006 , khesali & faghei 2009 , faghei 2011 ) .",
    "these advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) place an intermediate position between the spherically symmetric accretion flow of non - rotating fluid ( bondi 1952 ) and the cool thin disc of classical accretion disc theory ( e. g. pringle 1981 ) .",
    "these types of accretion flows have been widely applied to explain observations of the galactic black hole candidate ( e. g. narayan et al .",
    "1996 , hameury et al .",
    "1997 ) , the spectral transition of cyg x-1 ( esin 1996 ) and multi - wavelength spectral properties of sgr a@xmath0 ( narayan & yi 1995 ; manmoto et al .",
    "2000 ; narayan et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the x - ray observations of black holes imply that they are capable of accreting gas under a variety of flow configurations .",
    "in particular , observational evidences confirm existence of hot accretion flow , contrasted with the classical cold and thin accretion disc scenario ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . hot accretion flow can be found in the population of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei and during quiescent of accretion onto stellar - mass black holes in x - ray transients ( e.g. , narayan et al .",

    "_ chandra _ observations provide tight constraints on the density and temperature of gas at or near the bondi capture radius in sgr a@xmath0 and several other nearby galactic nuclei .",
    "tanaka & menou ( 2006 ) used these constraints ( loewenstein et al .",
    "2001 ; baganoff et al . 2003 ; di matteo et al . 2003 ; ho et al .",
    "2003 ) to calculate the mean free path for the observed gas .",
    "they suggested that accretion in these systems will be proceeded under the weakly collisional condition .",
    "furthermore , they suggested that thermal conduction can be as a possible mechanism by which the sufficient extra heating is provided in hot advection dominated accretion flows .",
    "generally , semi - analytical studies of hot accretion flows with thermal conduction have been related to steady state models ( e. g. tanaka & menou 2006 ; johnson & quataert 2007 ; shadmehri 2008 ; abbassi et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ; ghanbari et al .",
    "2009 ) , and dynamics of such systems have been studied in simulation models ( e. g. sharma et al .",
    "2008 ; wu et al .",
    "for example , tanaka & menou ( 2006 ) have carried out a related analysis and found the accretion flow can spontaneously produce thermal outflows driven in part by conduction .",
    "their analysis is two - dimensional but self - similar in radius .",
    "their assumption of self - similarity enforces a density profile that varies as @xmath2 , whereas simulations of adafs consistently find density profiles shallower than this ( e.g. , stone et al .",
    "1999 ; igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 ; stone & pringle 2001 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ; igumenshchev et al .",
    "johnson & quataert ( 2007 ) studied the effects of electron thermal conduction on the properties of hot accretion flows , under the assumption of spherical symmetry . since , electron heat conduction is important for low accretion rate systems , thus their model is applicable for sgr a@xmath0 in the galactic centre .",
    "they show that heat conduction leads to supervirial temperatures , implying that conduction significantly modifies the structure of the accretion flow .",
    "their model similar to tanaka & menou ( 2006 ) was the steady state , but they solved their equations numerically .",
    "as mentioned , semi - analytical studies of hot accretion flows with thermal conduction have been in a steady state .",
    "thus , it will be interesting to study _ dynamics _ of such systems . ogilvie ( 1999 ) by the unsteady self - similar method studied time - dependence of quasi - spherical accretion flow without thermal conduction . the solutions of ogilvie ( 1999 ) provided some insight into the dynamics of quasi - spherical accretion and avoided many of the limits of the steady self - similar solution . in this research , we want to explore how thermal conduction can affect the dynamics of a rotating and accreting viscous gas .",
    "we answer this question by solving ogilvie ( 1999 ) model that is affected by thermal conduction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define the general problem of constructing a model for hot quasi - spherical accretion flow . in section 3",
    ", we use the unsteady self - similar method to solve the integrated equations that govern the dynamical behaviour of the accreting gas , and numerical study of the model is brought in this section , too .",
    "we will present a summary of the model in section 4 .",
    "we start with the approach adopted by ogilvie ( 1999 ) , who studied quasi - spherical accretion flows without thermal conduction .",
    "thus , we derive the basic equations that describe the physics of accretion flow with thermal conduction .",
    "we use the spherical coordinates @xmath3 centred on the accreting object and make the following standard assumptions :    1 .",
    "the gravitational force on a fluid element is characterized by the newtonian potential of a point mass , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 representing the gravitational constant and @xmath6 standing for the mass of the central star .",
    "the written equations in spherical coordinates are considered in the equatorial plane @xmath7 and terms with any @xmath8 and @xmath9 dependence are neglected , hence all quantities will be expressed in terms of spherical radius @xmath10 and time @xmath11 .",
    "3 .   for simplicity ,",
    "self - gravity and general relativistic effects have been neglected .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the dynamics of accretion flow describes by the following equations : + the continuity equation @xmath12 the radial force equation @xmath13 the azimuthal force equation @xmath14=    \\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left[\\nu\\rho r^{4}\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial r}\\right],\\ ] ] the energy equation @xmath15 + \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\frac{p}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r^2 v_r\\right)=\\\\   q_{vis}-q_{rad}+q_{cond}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 the density , @xmath17 the radial velocity , @xmath18 the angular velocity , @xmath19 $ ] keplerian angular velocity , @xmath20 the gas pressure , @xmath21 is the adiabatic index , @xmath22 the kinematic viscosity coefficient and it is given as in narayan & yi ( 1995a ) by an @xmath1-model    @xmath23    the parameter of @xmath1 is assumed to be a constant less than unity .",
    "the terms on the right - hand side of the energy equation , @xmath24 is the heating rate of the gas by the viscous dissipation , @xmath25 represents the energy loss through radiative cooling , and @xmath26 is the transported energy by thermal conduction . for the right - hand side of the energy equation , we can write @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the advective transport of energy .",
    "we employ the advection factor , @xmath29 , that describes the fraction of the dissipation energy which is stored in the accretion flow and advected into the central object rather than being radiated away",
    ". the advection factor of @xmath30 in general depends on the details of the heating and radiative cooling mechanism and will vary with position ( e.g. watari 2006 , 2007 ; sinha et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , we assume a constant @xmath30 for simplicity",
    ". clearly , the case @xmath31 corresponds to the extreme limit of no radiative cooling and in the limit of efficient radiative cooling , we have @xmath32 .    in a collisional plasma ,",
    "mean free path for electron energy exchange , @xmath33 , is shorter than temperature scale height , @xmath34 , and thus the heat flux due to thermal conduction can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the thermal conductivity coefficient .",
    "thermal conductivity in a dense , fully ionized gas is given by the spitzer ( 1962 ) formula , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electron temperature ( @xmath39 for a one - temperature plasma ) and @xmath40 is coulomb logarithm that for @xmath41 is @xmath42 the heat is conducted by the electron , and equation ( 8) includes the effect of the self - consistent electric required to maintain the electric current at zero ; this reduces @xmath36 by a factor of about @xmath43 from the value it would otherwise have ( cowie & mckee 1977 , hereafter cm77 ) .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the inner regions of hot accretion flows are , in many cases , collisionless with electron mean free path due to coulomb collision larger than the radius ( e. g. tanaka & menou 2006 ) . when the mean free path of an electron becomes comparable to or larger than the temperature gradient scale @xmath44 , equation ( 7 ) for the heat flux",
    "is no longer valid ; cm77 described this effect as _",
    "saturation_. the maximum heat flux in a plasma can be expressed as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a characteristic velocity which one might expect to be the order of the electron thermal velocity ( parker 1963 ) .",
    "assuming maxwellian distribution for heat source , the characteristic velocity can be written as ( williams 1971 ; cm77 ) @xmath47 similar to cm77 , we assume that the heat flux is reduced by the same factor of @xmath43 in the saturated case as in the classical ( collisional ) case so that the saturated heat flux is @xmath48 cm77 showed that the saturated heat flux is significantly less than conjectured by parker ( 1963 ) .",
    "thus , in order to explicitly allow for uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath49 , they introduced a factor of @xmath50 , which was less than unity and rewrote equation ( 11 ) as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is sound speed , which is defined as @xmath53 .",
    "the factor of @xmath50 is called as saturation constant ( cm77 ) .",
    "now , the viscous heating rate and the energy transport by thermal conduction are expressed as @xmath54 @xmath55 by using equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) for the advective transport of energy , we can write @xmath56    the mass accretion rate in a qausi - spherical accretion flow can be written as @xmath57 we will use this quantity in the next section , and will investigate effects of saturation constant and viscous parameter on it .",

    "examples of such solutions are presented in figs 1 - 5 .",

    "( 2008 ) and wu et al .",
    "we know the viscous dissipation of the flow increases by adding @xmath1 parameter .",
    "thus , the temperature increased by viscous parameter confirmed by the temperature profiles in fig 2 .",
    "the density profiles show the gas density increased by adding the @xmath50 parameter",
    ". it can be due to temperature fall of fluid .",
    "increasing density by adding saturation constant is another consistency of our results with simulations of wu et al .",
    "also , the density profiles show that it decreases by adding the viscous parameter .",
    "this also could be result of the temperature rising .",
    "the viscous turbulence in this paper is proportional to the gas temperature ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "thus , increase or decrease of temperature will affect dynamics of the accreting gas . as we said",
    "the temperature decreased by saturation constant implies that the viscous turbulence decreases , too .",
    "the decreasing of viscous turbulence reduces the effect of negative viscous torque in angular momentum equation .",
    "thus , we expect the flow rotates faster by adding saturation constant that confirmed by the angular velocity profiles in fig .",
    "since , the efficiency of the angular momentum transport decreases by adding the saturation constant , we expect the decrease of radial infall velocity that the radial velocity profiles in fig .",
    "1 confirm it .",
    "the efficiency of angular momentum transport increases by adding the viscous parameter of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we expect the flow rotates slower and accretes faster by adding the viscous parameter .",

    "3 . in the present model",
    ", the mass accretion rate is reduced by radius . while , the mass accretion rate in steady hot accretion flows is a constant ( tanaka & menou 2006 ) .",
    "there are some researches in steady hot accretion flows that have studied power - law function of mass accretion rate ( shadmehri 2008 ; abbassi et al .",
    "however , the mass accretion rate in their models is not dependent on important parameters such as saturation constant and viscous parameter .",
    "the profiles of mass accretion rate in fig . 3 show that it is reduced by adding the saturation constant .",

    "the transonic point occurs in place that the amount of _ mach number _ becomes equal to unity .",

    "the dependency of transonic point to saturation constant shows that this point moves inward by adding the parameter of @xmath50 . because , thermal conduction transfers the heat to larger radii , so the sound speed / temperature decreases by adding the saturation constant . in other words ,",

    "in hot accretion flows , the collision timescale between ions and electrons is longer than the inflow timescale . thus , the inflow plasma is collisionless , and the transfer of energy by thermal conduction can be dynamically important .",
    "the low collisional rate of the gas is confirmed by direct observation , particularly in the case of the galactic centre ( quataert 2004 ; tanaka & menou 2006 ) and in the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters ( sarazin 1986 ) .    here",

    "thus , we assumed that angular momentum transport is due to viscous turbulence and the @xmath1-prescription is used for the kinematic coefficient of viscosity .",
    "we also assumed the flow does not have a good cooling efficiency and so a fraction of energy accretes along with matter on to the central object .",
