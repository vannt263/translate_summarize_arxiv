    "the electronic properties of graphene@xcite have attracted in the last four years huge experimental as well as theoretical attention.@xcite besides its fundamental interest as a new type of two - dimensional electron liquid , graphene is in fact regarded as a promising material for future nanoelectronic devices,@xcite in particular in the field of spintronics,@xcite due to its small intrinsic spin - orbit@xcite and hyperfine interactions.@xcite indeed several recent experiments@xcite have by now demonstrated spin injection and detection in a single layer of graphene sandwiched between ferromagnetic metal electrodes and observed coherent spin transport over micrometer scale distances .    motivated by these developments , in this paper we focus on the problem of spin resolved transport through _ magnetic nanostructures _ in graphene . the studies of graphene s transport properties through magnetic barriers and more complex structures @xcite address the problem of controlling the confinement and the transport of charge carriers by means of appropriate configurations of an external magnetic field inhomogeneous on sub - micron scales .",
    "different types of magnetic nanostructures have been envisioned and their properties investigated , e.g. , barriers @xcite , dots @xcite , wires @xcite and superlattices .",
    "@xcite    in all these works the spin degree of freedom has been completely neglected .",
    "this is justified because of the smallness of both zeeman splitting and spin - orbit coupling@xcite in graphene .",
    "however , the continuous and rapid improvements in sample preparation and experimental technology and resolution in graphene research call for a refinement of the theoretical analysis to incorporate such finer effects . more importantly , it has recently been argued that local ferromagnetic correlations can be induced in graphene by several different mechanisms , e.g. , proximity of a ferromagnetic insulator,@xcite coulomb interactions,@xcite presence of defects,@xcite application of an electric field in the transverse direction in nanoribbons.@xcite the ferromagnetism leads to a spin splitting effectively similar to a zeeman interaction but of much larger magnitude .",
    "for example , a ferromagnetic insulator deposited on top of a graphene layer has been predicted to produce a spin splitting of up to @xmath0 mev .",
    "@xcite this is comparable with the orbital energy in a field of @xmath1 t , which is of order of @xmath2 mev , and thus may have important effects .",
    "the spin transport through ferromagnetic graphene has already received some attention,@xcite but to the best of our knowledge all works so far have focussed only on spin effects and did not consider orbital effects .",
    "aim of this paper then is to fill the gap and investigate this problem by fully taking into account the quasiparticle s spin dynamics as well as its orbital motion in an inhomogeneous magnetic field .    in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the effects of zeeman and exchange spin splitting and postpone the interesting problem of spin - orbit coupling to a future work .",
    "we show that the spin - resolved transmissions exhibit a strong dependence on the incidence angle , which allows in principle for a selective transmission of spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "this effect can be qualitatively understood by a simple semiclassical argument .",
    "the bending of the electron trajectories under the barrier depends on the energy and thus , in the presence of spin splitting , is different for the two spin projections .",
    "the magnitude of the polarization that can be achieved depends on the spin splitting and can be very large in the presence of a large splitting , as , e.g. , that originating from a proximity - induced exchange field .",
    "moreover , in a resonant double barrier configuration , the polarization can be enhanced by increasing the distance between the barriers . in this case , in fact , even for relatively small splitting there exists an energy range where the polarization reaches values close to one for large enough distance .    while there exist several experimental techniques to produce magnetic barriers , for concreteness we shall have in mind the case of the fringe fields created by a ferromagnetic stripe deposited on top of the graphene sample .",
    "the magnetic field generated by the stripe is known analytically .",
    "@xcite the corresponding vector potential in the landau gauge can be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4   , \\label{vecpot}\\ ] ] and we assume that the system is translationally invariant in the @xmath5 direction .",

    "then the orbital dynamics is only affected by the perpendicular component @xmath7 , while both @xmath8 and @xmath7 contribute to the zeeman interaction .",
    "in addition we shall also include in the zeeman term the effects of a possible exchange field .",
    "@xcite    the transport properties of such structures can be calculated by means of the landauer - bttiker formalism in terms of the spin - resolved transmission matrix @xmath9 , which gives the probability amplitude for a quasiparticle incident on the magnetic structure from the left with spin projection @xmath10 to be transmitted with spin @xmath11 .",

    "we have shown that an inhomogeneous field profile together with a strong in - plane spin splitting can produce a remarkable wavevector - dependent spin filtering effect .",

    "this result can be understood by means of a simple kinematical analysis of the problem .    while we confined ourselves to zero temperature",
    ", we expect that the effect should be observable at finite temperature as well , as long as the temperature is smaller than the in - plane spin splitting . if the splitting originates from the exchange coupling and the estimate of ref",
    ". is experimentally confirmed , then there is a comfortable temperature window ( say below 10 k ) where the effect we discussed could in principle be observed .",
    "other mechanisms inducing local ferromagnetic correlations in graphene could also be exploited to increase the spin splitting , thereby improving the spin filtering effect . moreover , since the orbital dynamics and the spin dynamics in this problem are to a large extent decoupled ( this would not be the case with spin - orbit coupling ) , we expect that the addition of a small amount of impurity scattering would not spoil the spin filtering effect , at least as long as the scatterers are enough long - range that they do not induce scattering between the two k points .    along the same lines of this work , one could also investigate the effects of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",
    "while the soc has so far been estimated to be very small in graphene,@xcite recent experimental results@xcite indicate that in quasifreestanding graphene produced on ni(111 ) with intercalation of au the rashba effect leads to a large spin splitting of order of 13 mev .",
