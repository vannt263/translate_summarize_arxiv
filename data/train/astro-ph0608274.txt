    "extra - galactic radio sources are a significant contaminant in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) experiments ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of the cmb and sze @xcite have the potential to yield a wealth of cosmological information if foreground contaminants are well - understood",
    ". models for the number counts of radio sources as a function of flux @xcite have been derived from observations at lower frequencies and extrapolated to microwave frequencies .",
    "radio sources are often associated with the clusters of galaxies themselves .",
    "this is a potential source of bias for current and planned sze surveys such as the sunyaev - zeldovich array ( sza ) , the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) , the atacama pathfinder experiment sunyaev - zeldovich ( apex - sz ) survey , the south pole telescope ( spt ) , and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) . to understand the impact on planned sze cluster surveys , it is critical to characterize the spatial , spectral , and flux distribution of sources associated with clusters .    contaminating radio emission from extra - galactic sources at frequencies less than approximately 100 ghz",
    "is attributed to synchrotron radiation from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and star - forming galaxies .",
    "the agn - powered radio galaxies dominate the source counts at high luminosities . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the emission is attributed to dust emission from star - forming galaxies .",
    "observations of radio sources toward galaxy clusters at very low frequencies ( @xmath8 ghz ; e.g. , @xcite ) show a strong central concentration of radio galaxies in clusters .",
    "the distribution of synchrotron - emitting star - forming galaxies is found to be less centrally - peaked in clusters @xcite than that of agn - powered radio galaxies . at our sensitivity level and observing frequency of 28.5 ghz ,",
    "radio sources powered by agn dominate and we refer to them henceforth as radio sources .    several cmb experiments , such as wmap @xcite , dasi @xcite , vsa @xcite , and cbi @xcite , have measured microwave source counts as a function of flux for sources brighter than about 10 mjy .",
    "there have been two prior analyses of radio sources in sze data taken with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) and berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) arrays . using a sample of 56 fields centered on known massive galaxy clusters , @xcite computed counts and spectral indices of radio sources . using the outer regions of 41 cluster fields , @xcite computed the normalization of source counts as a function of flux for faint sources in sze data .",
    "the data used in @xcite and in @xcite are subsets of the data presented in this paper .",
    "in this paper we analyse faint ( @xmath9  mjy ) radio sources found serendipitously toward massive galaxy clusters at 28.5 ghz from the ovro / bima sze imaging project . characterizing the spatial , spectral , and flux distribution at this relatively high frequency should help improve projections for radio source contamination in sze and cmb experiments at frequencies of 30 ghz and higher .",
    "we use 89 fields centered on known massive galaxy clusters and 8 non - cluster fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 reviews the observations , data reduction , field selection , and the measured source fluxes . in section 3",
    ", we compute spectral indices between 1.4 and 28.5 ghz using fluxes from our data and published 1.4 ghz surveys . in section 4 ,",
    "we present source counts as a function of flux for cluster and non - cluster fields as well as the angular radial dependence of counts in cluster fields .",
    "we compare our results with those from other experiments and with theoretical models .",
    "the 28.5 ghz observations were carried out with bima during the summers of 1996  2002 and ovro during the summers of 1995  2001 as part of the ovro / bima sze imaging project ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 62 cluster fields were observed at bima and 55 cluster fields were observed at ovro .",
    "a total of 28 cluster fields were observed at both bima and ovro , yielding observations of 89 unique cluster fields . for the bima cmb finescale anisotropy project @xcite , a total of 18 non - cluster fields were observed .",
    "the bima array consists of ten 6.1 meter diameter telescopes with primary beams of 6.6 arcmin fwhm ; nine of the ten bima telescopes were used for the 28.5 ghz observations .",
    "the ovro array consists of six 10.4-meter telescopes , with primary beams of 4.2 arcmin fwhm ; all six ovro telescopes were used .",
    "the primary beams were measured holographically and were found to be well - approximated by gaussians ; we use the azimuthally averaged measured beam responses in our analyses . for cmb observations at bima",
    ", the array was set in a compact configuration to maximize brightness sensitivity . for cluster observations at both ovro and bima ,",
    "most of the telescopes were also configured in a compact configuration that provided dense @xmath10 coverage to the shadowing limit , and one or two telescopes were placed at longer baselines for higher angular resolution monitoring of sources .",
    "the longest baselines used at ovro and bima ranged from 70 to 140 meters for the data presented here .",
    "the telescopes were outfitted with cm - wave receivers @xcite equipped with cryogenically cooled 26 - 36 ghz hemt amplifiers @xcite .",
    "typical receiver temperatures were 11  k to 20  k , and when integrated with the ovro and bima telescopes yielded typical system temperatures scaled to above the atmosphere of 45  k to 55  k , and as low as 35 k. ovro observations were correlated with an analog correlator consisting of two 1 ghz bandwidth channels centered at 28.5 and 30 ghz . the @xmath10 data from the two channels were not combined before making maps or fitting sources to the data . the ovro correlator integration time was four minutes or less .",
    "bima observations were correlated with a multi - channel hybrid correlator .",
    "after calibration , the @xmath10 data were reduced to a single 0.8 ghz wide bandwidth centered at 28.5 ghz .",
    "the bima correlator integration time was 50 seconds .",
    "observations of cluster and cmb fields were interleaved every @xmath9 20 minutes with observations of a strong point source for phase calibration .",
    "source data that were not bracketed in time by phase calibrator data were discarded , as were data from baselines in which one of the array elements was shadowed by another .",
    "source data were also discarded if the bracketing phase calibrator observations showed a discontinuity in the instrument phase response .",
    "lastly , source data were discarded if atmospheric phase fluctuations showed a loss of correlation greater than a few percent on the long baseline observations of the phase calibrator .",
    "observations of the phase calibrators indicate the gain stability was stable to @xmath11 over several months .",
    "the absolute calibration is based on observations of mars , with the brightness temperature taken from the @xcite model .",
    "further details of the observations and data reduction can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cluster fields of the ovro / bima sze imaging project were chosen to obtain precise measurements of the sze in massive galaxy clusters .",
    "potential targets were screened for strong radio sources using archival data at lower frequencies such as nvss @xcite and first @xcite .",
    "in addition , if a strong source ( @xmath12 mjy ) was detected near the cluster center in the initial 28.5 ghz observations , observations ceased in favor of other less contaminated targets . due to the constraints of this field selection , we do not attempt to characterize the distribution of sources brighter than 10 mjy in this analysis .",
    "the cluster fields were chosen mainly from x - ray catalogs and one optical survey , including the following : ( 1 ) the rosat brightest cluster survey , bcs @xcite , ( 2 ) the einstein observatory extended medium sensitivity survey , emss @xcite , ( 3 ) the rosat x - ray brightest abell clusters , xbacs @xcite , ( 4 ) the wide angle rosat pointed survey , warps @xcite , ( 5 ) the massive cluster survey , macs @xcite , and ( 6 ) the red - sequence cluster survey , rcs @xcite .",
    "clusters were selected from the bcs , emss , and xbacs x - ray catalogs on the basis of high x - ray luminosity .",
    "clusters from warps and macs were selected for x - ray luminosity and high redshift .",
    "the 8 clusters selected for sze observations from macs form a complete redshift - selected flux - limited x - ray sample and were chosen regardless of possible radio source contamination @xcite . a few optically selected clusters were also provided by the rcs team .",
    "table 1 lists the coordinates of the pointing centers for the cluster fields .",
    "the bima array was also used to observe 18 non - cluster fields for cmb anisotropy measurements @xcite .",
    "the pointing center coordinates for these fields are provided in table 2 . of these fields ,",
    "only the 8 fields bdf14-bdf21 @xcite were chosen without regard to possible radio source contamination .",
    "the fields bdf4 , and bdf6-bdf13 @xcite were chosen from nvss to have minimal contamination from strong radio sources .",
    "the field hdf is centered on the hubble deep field and was also selected to have no strong radio sources . only the 8 fields selected without regard to source contamination are used in the analysis presented in this paper .      the positions and fluxes of 28.5  ghz sources and sze decrements are determined using the difmap software package @xcite .",
    "the sze data consist of positions in the fourier domain ( also called the @xmath10 plane ) and the visibilities  the complex fourier component pairs as functions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are the fourier conjugate variables to right ascension and declination .",
    "difmap is used to create a map from the @xmath10 data using all baselines and natural weighting ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "source and decrement positions are determined from this map .",
    "emission sources are initally assumed to be pointlike , while the sze decrement ( if any ) is approximated with an elliptical , isothermal @xmath16 model .",
    "the fourier transforms of the model components are jointly fit to the observed visibilities .",
    "the image of the residuals is searched for additional sources at greater than five times the image rms and any sources found in this way are added to the model and jointly refitted .",
    "noise estimates are extracted from the final residual images .",
    "the source fluxes determined in this way depend on the coverage of the @xmath10 plane for sources with structure on scales larger than that probed by the longest baselines ( 30 arcsec to 15 arcsec for the 70 to 140 meter maximum baselines employed here ) . to enable a uniform comparison with lower frequency data from the nvss , which has an angular resolution of 45 arcsec , we repeat the @xmath10 fitting procedure considering only baselines shorter than 4  @xmath17 .",
    "this provides matched angular resolution at a cost of typically @xmath18% of our data , yielding a sensitivity loss of @xmath19% .",
    "we also measured the flux within an extended area centered on each radio source in the cleaned maps made from the 4  @xmath17 cut and full @xmath10 data set .",
    "we compare the fluxes obtained from the @xmath10 model fits and the analysis of the cleaned maps from both the cut and the full @xmath10 data .",
    "we find the fluxes found with the four methods agree for 103 out of 121 sources , double - counting sources detected with both arrays because of the difference in sensitivity and @xmath10 coverage . in these cases we conclude that the point source approximation is adequate for our angular resolution and sensitivity and we report the fluxes and noise levels determined from all baselines in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the remaining 18 sources have best - fit point source fluxes that depend on our choice of @xmath10 range .",
    "we find , however , that the total flux recovered by the clean algorithm in the region around each source in the full data set matches that obtained for the flux found with only the short baselines for all but one of these sources . in these cases",
    "we use the flux measured in the cleaned map made from the full data set . finally , in one case ( macs  j0717.5 + 3745 , source 1 ) we do not recover the full short - baseline flux when cleaning the image of the full data set . in this case",
    "we have used the flux and noise measured for just the baselines shorter than 4  @xmath17 for both sources in the field .",
    "table 1 lists the 28.5 ghz beam attenuation - corrected fluxes for sources detected in the bima and ovro cluster fields and the centroid of the sze decrement , if any .",
    "noise is reported for the field center in column 7 , while the uncertainty in the flux of each source ( column 15 ) properly accounts for the beam profile .",
    "the radial distance from the pointing center , or the sz decrement if observed , to each source is also provided . at the 5@xmath20-level or greater",
    "we detect 62 sources in the 62 bima cluster fields and 55 sources in the 55 ovro cluster fields .",
    "a total of 22 sources are detected at both bima and ovro , yielding 95 unique sources in the 89 cluster fields . for sources observed at both bima and ovro ,",
    "the flux measurements are in good agreement .",
    "source fluxes , positions , and noise levels for the non - cluster fields are given in table 2 .",
    "we detect two sources at @xmath21 in the 8 bima non - cluster fields which were selected without regard to possible source contamination .",
    "the fluxes in tables 1 and 2 do not account for attenuation due to temporal and spectral averaging of the @xmath10 data , effects which are far less significant than the beam attenuation .",
    "averaging of interferometric data in the @xmath10 plane leads to attenuation of the amplitude response as a function of angular distance from the field center that depends on the telescope array configuration .",
    "however , these effects have been restricted to insignificant levels as part of the experimental design .",
    "the bandwidth constraint translates to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the fractional bandwidth , @xmath24 is the diameter of an array element and @xmath25 is the baseline . for the longest baselines we find values of @xmath26 to be 0.32 - 0.64 and 0.24 - 0.47 for the bima and ovro observations , respectively . for measurements using only short baselines ( @xmath27 )",
    "these values decrease to 0.18 and 0.13 , respectively .",
    "the correspondence between our measured fluxes using all baselines and just the short baselines also suggests that bandwidth smearing is not important .",
    "the integration time constraint translates to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the @xmath10 averaging time in hours . for the longest baselines and integration times we find values of @xmath30 to be less than 0.0035 and 0.001 for the bima and ovro observations , respectively",
    "we use the results of surveys at lower observing frequency to constrain the spectral indices of radio sources detected with the bima / ovro observations",
    ". fluxes at 1.4 ghz are taken primarily from the nvss catalog , which has a resolution of 45 arcsec and limiting peak source brightness of 2.5 mjy .",
    "we obtain 1.4 ghz fluxes from the first catalog ( limiting flux of 1 mjy and resolution of 5 arcsec ) for several additional sources which were below the nvss detection threshold .",
    "we obtain 1.4 ghz fluxes from vla archival maps for several sources which were not in the nvss or first catalogs .",
    "of the 95 sources in the cluster fields , 88 have unambiguous counterparts in the nvss , first , or vla archival data .",
    "all 28.5 ghz sources within 0.5 arcmin of the cluster centers were confirmed to have counterparts at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the 1.4 ghz fluxes and the results of a literature search for low frequency measurements of sources not identified in the nvss , first , or vla surveys are given in table 1 . unless otherwise noted , the tabulated 1.4 ghz fluxes are from nvss . for the 7 sources that do not have unambiguous 1.4 ghz counterparts in nvss , first , or the vla archive ,",
    "we assume a 1.4 ghz flux equal to three times the survey noise . in reality , the true 1.4 ghz fluxes typically will be weaker and the true spectral indices of these sources more shallow .",
    "however , because there are only 7 sources lacking 1.4 ghz detections , the bias in the resulting mean spectral index for all sources in cluster fields computed below is small .",
    "furthermore , because the 1.4 and 28.5 ghz measurements were not made contemporaneously , variability of the sources may contribute to a broadening in the distribution of spectral indices .",
    "we compute spectral indices between 1.4 and 28.5 ghz for sources in the cluster fields ( selected at 28.5 ghz ) where index @xmath31 is defined by @xmath4 .",
    "if we use only the 88 sources with detections in nvss , first , or the vla maps and omit the 7 sources lacking 1.4 ghz detections , the resulting mean spectral index is @xmath32 with an rms dispersion of @xmath3 . if we include limits for the 7 sources lacking 1.4 ghz detections , the mean spectral index @xmath33 with an rms dispersion of @xmath34 , and a median index of @xmath35 , indicating that the bias due to omitting these 7 sources is small .",
    "we use the 88 sources with nvss , first , or vla counterparts for the remainder of our spectral index analysis .",
    "a histogram of spectral indices for these 88 sources is shown in figure 1 .",
    "characterizations of the spectral index distribution are given in table 3 .",
    "the distribution has a tail at low-@xmath31 and is not well fit by a gaussian .",
    "we therefore also compute the median of the distribution , as well as the 25th and 75th percentiles and find them to be @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "while the beam attenuation factor is potentially a significant source of uncertainty for the 28.5 ghz sources , we find that excluding sources at large radii ( attenuation factor greater than 5.0 ) does not change the results .",
    "we choose a maximum cutoff outer radius of 6.6 arcmin for bima and 4.2 arcmin for ovro , corresponding to a beam attenuation factor of about 30 and spanning a region twice the fwhm of the primary beam .",
    "when a source has observations from both bima and ovro , we choose the one with the best combination of sensitivity and survey area .",
    "the radial distribution of spectral indices is shown in figure 2 ; there is no apparent trend in spectral index with radius from the cluster center .",
    "we compare the spectral index distribution of the central regions of cluster fields ( @xmath36 arcmin ) with the distribution of the outer regions of cluster fields ( @xmath37 arcmin ) and find no significant differences .",
    "the mean spectral index for the central regions of cluster fields is @xmath38 with an rms dispersion of @xmath39 and the mean spectral index for the outer regions of cluster fields is @xmath40 with an rms dispersion of @xmath41 .",
    "the medians are @xmath42 [ 0.56 ( 25% ) , 0.94 ( 75% ) ] for the central regions and @xmath35 [ 0.42 ( 25% ) , 0.88 ( 75% ) ] for the outer regions .",
    "the results of a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test indicate that the distribution of spectral indices of sources in the inner regions of the cluster fields is consistent with that of the outer regions .",
    "the maximum distance between their cumulative distribution functions is 0.18 , corresponding to an @xmath43 probability that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "since we have few sources in non - cluster fields , we do not compute an average spectral index for this group .",
    "we compare the spectral index distribution of our mjy cluster sources to those of somewhat brighter field sources measured by other groups @xcite ; a summary is given in table 3 .",
    "the cbi group @xcite finds a spectral index from 1.4 to 31 ghz of @xmath44 with an rms dispersion of @xmath45 . as a follow - up to the 9c survey @xcite , @xcite",
    "compute indices between several frequencies from 1.4 to 43 ghz , distinguishing between weak and strong sources .",
    "the mean spectral index for the lower flux sample is @xmath46 for the lower frequencies , and steepens to @xmath47 from 15.2 to 43 ghz . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also find that a greater percentage of the strong sources have a flat or rising spectrum .",
    "our spectral indices are somewhat steeper than the spectral indices measured by cbi and much steeper than those of the @xmath9  jy sources ( @xmath48 ) measured by wmap @xcite . when comparing source surveys , it is essential to consider the flux and frequency at which the sources are selected",
    ". we expect a survey of strong sources selected at high frequency to have a flatter spectral index than a survey of low flux sources selected at lower frequency .",
    "our results are for a relatively low flux survey selected at high frequency , and it is interesting that the spectral index is relatively steep .",
    "the sources in our survey primarily lie in the environments of rich galaxy clusters and it is possible that there are significant differences between this population of sources and that found in surveys that do not target clusters .",
    "our spectral indices for radio sources towards clusters are similar to those found towards clusters at 2.7 ghz by @xcite .",
    "they find that spectral indices are steeper in clusters than in the field and note a trend of shallower spectral indices with increasing cluster radius .",
    "using our mean spectral index of 0.66 , the lower flux limit of 0.12 jy at 2.7 ghz from @xcite translates to 25 mjy at 28.5 ghz , which is slightly stronger than the upper limit of our source sample .    as we look at sources with higher redshift , the emission frequency of the radiation increases .",
    "we might , therefore , expect these sources to have steeper spectral indices . however , the sources are selected at higher frequency which might bias the sample toward flatter spectral indices . in figure 3",
    ", we plot spectral index as a function of cluster redshift and see no clear trend .",
    "the mean and rms dispersion in the spectral index are 0.67 and 0.37 for @xmath49 , compared to 0.64 and 0.29 for @xmath50 , and 0.76 and 0.20 for @xmath51 .",
    "with the field selection effects in mind from section 2.2 , we compute the differential source counts as a function of flux , @xmath52 , in several flux bins , accounting for the varying noise levels from field to field .",
    "we chose the flux bins in order to maximize the number of sources used and to have a similar number of sources in each bin .",
    "the survey boundary of each field for a given flux bin is set by the noise level of the field . for each flux bin and field ,",
    "the minimum level in the flux bin sets the allowable beam - corrected noise level and the corresponding maximum attenuation radius for the field .",
    "for example , for @xmath21 sources in a flux bin of 1.5 - 2.5 mjy , the allowable beam - corrected noise level is @xmath53 mjy .",
    "this noise level sets the attenuation radius for the field , the radius at which the beam attenuation factor equals the beam - corrected noise level divided by the uncorrected noise level .",
    "we set an outer boundary on the survey area for the field using the lesser of the attenuation radius or a maximum cutoff outer radius away from the field pointing center .",
    "we choose a maximum cutoff outer radius of 6.6 arcmin for bima and 4.2 arcmin for ovro , corresponding to a beam attenuation factor of about 30 and spanning a region twice the fwhm of the primary beam . we treat this as a hard maximum cutoff ;",
    "even if the noise is sufficiently low to allow us to go to greater radii in our sampling of a field , we do not .",
    "the outer boundary is measured relative to the field pointing center .",
    "we further break the data into radial bins from the cluster center .",
    "the cluster center is determined by the location of the sze decrement . for fields without a sze decrement detection ,",
    "the pointing center is used as the center of the field . for each field , flux bin , and radial bin ,",
    "we compute the survey area within the boundary set by the radial bin and the noise level for the field .",
    "typically the survey region for a given field , flux bin , and radial bin is a circle or annulus , sometimes cut off by the noise boundary .",
    "we compute the total survey area for each flux bin by adding up the area in all the fields . when a field has observations from both bima and ovro , we choose the one with the best combination of sensitivity and survey area .    for each field",
    "we identify all @xmath21 sources in the survey area that fall between the minimum and maximum fluxes of each flux bin .",
    "we count up the sources in each flux bin to get raw total source counts in the total survey area .",
    "the errors for the raw counts in each bin are assumed to be poisson distributed .",
    "differential source counts ( @xmath52 ) and the associated errors are calculated by dividing the total raw counts in each bin by the total survey area for the corresponding flux bin and by the flux bin width .",
    "differential source counts ( @xmath52 ) , the number of sources , and the survey area for each flux bin are given in figure 4 and table 4 for the central regions of the cluster fields ( r @xmath54 arcmin ) , the outer regions of the cluster fields ( r @xmath55 arcmin ) , and for the non - cluster fields .",
    "the error bars on @xmath52 are the poisson errors on the raw source counts and do not include other sources of uncertainty .",
    "typical raw counts of sources are @xmath56 in each flux bin for the inner regions of the cluster fields and @xmath57 for the outer cluster regions .",
    "we only detect two @xmath21 sources in the 8 non - cluster fields that were selected without regard to possible radio source contamination .",
    "the differential source counts can be described by a power law , @xmath58 , where @xmath59mjy for this analysis .",
    "best fits using a markov chain algorithm that simultaneously estimate the normalizations for the inner , outer , and non - cluster regions , and a common power - law index are shown with the data in figure 4 and are given in table 5 .",
    "the best - fit common power - law index is @xmath60 .",
    "best fit power - laws for the central and outer cluster regions individually are also shown in figure 4 and table 5 . as a cross - check , we compute @xmath52 for the bima and ovro fields separately and find good agreement ; see figure 5 .",
    "all uncertainties represent 68% confidence intervals unless otherwise noted .",
    "source counts are found to be greatly elevated toward the central core of the cluster fields . using the normalizations from the best simultaneous fit ,",
    "source counts are found to be a factor of @xmath0 higher in the central regions than in the outer regions of the cluster fields .",
    "counts are also elevated in the outer regions of the cluster fields relative to the non - cluster fields by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "these overdensities imply that @xmath61 of sources in the inner regions are cluster members , as are @xmath62 of sources in the outer regions",
    ". a comparable overabundance of radio sources toward galaxy clusters is also seen at lower radio frequencies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we considered the possibility that gravitational lensing of background radio galaxies could produce the overabundance of detected radio sources in the direction of massive galaxy clusters . a gravitational lens with magnification factor",
    "@xmath63 will modify the source counts to @xmath64 .",
    "if the unlensed source counts can be described by a power law , @xmath65 , then the source counts will be changed by a factor @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the mean magnification in the bima and ovro cluster fields is estimated by @xcite to be @xmath67 . in this analysis",
    ", we temporarily assume that all sources are background sources drawn from the same distribution and capable of being lensed . using the best joint fit power law index of @xmath68",
    "we expect a factor of @xmath69 , i.e. , no change in source counts in the direction of the clusters due to lensing .",
    "therefore we conclude that , regardless of the magnification , gravitational lensing can not be responsible for the significant excess of sources seen in the direction of clusters .    in figure 6",
    "we compare our measurements of @xmath52 with the @xcite 30 ghz model and with measurements from other experiments , including wmap , dasi , vsa , and cbi , which all examine non - cluster fields .",
    "we present source counts in terms of @xmath70 , for ease of comparison .",
    "counts in our non - cluster fields are consistent with those expected from the model and from extrapolations from other experiments , although with only two @xmath21 sources in those fields , the sample variance is large .",
    "the source counts toward cluster fields have a similar power - law slope , but a higher normalization than expected from extrapolations of measurements of sky not concentrated on clusters .",
    "from deep interferometric observations at 28.5 ghz of unresolved radio sources toward 89 fields centered on massive galaxy clusters and 8 non - cluster fields , we find that differential source counts are greatly elevated in the centers of cluster fields .",

    "counts in our non - cluster fields are consistent with those expected from models and from extrapolations from other experiments .",
    "in addition , source counts in the outer regions of cluster fields are a factor of @xmath1 higher than counts in non - cluster fields .    using the nvss and other surveys",
    ", we find a mean spectral index for sources in cluster fields between 1.4 and @xmath71ghz of @xmath32 with rms dispersion of @xmath3 , where flux @xmath4 .",
    "the distribution is skewed , with a median spectral index of @xmath5 [ @xmath6 ( 25% ) , @xmath7 ( 75% ) ] .",
