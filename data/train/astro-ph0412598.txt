    "polarized galactic synchrotron emission is one of the most important foregrounds in measuring the cosmic microwave background polarization ( cmbp ) up to about 100  ghz . above that frequency dust emission",
    "becomes the dominant contaminant .",
    "moreover , as the fractional polarization of the synchrotron emission can be 30% and as cmbp is just few percent of the cmb anisotropy , the degree of contamination is expected to be worse than in temperature anisotropy measurements .",
    "the study of this foreground is thus crucial for cmbp experiments .",
    "it will allow an estimate of the contamination level , and will aid developing cleaning procedures to remove its contribution from the cosmic signal ( e.g. see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the cmbp emission peaks on sub - degree angular scales in the 530  arcmin range ( e.g. see  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , observations of cmbp can be carried on in small sky patches that are large enough to allow good statistics ( @xmath11@xmath12 wide ) but , at the same time , small enough to minimize environmental systematics , e.g. spillover from ground emission .",
    "the latter could swamp the detection of the faint ( few @xmath13k ) cosmic signal .",
    "small regions , moreover , have the additional advantage of allowing a part of the sky low in synchrotron contamination to be selected .    the synchrotron emission can be best observed at low frequency , where it dominates other diffuse components ( dust , free - free , and cmbp itself ) and where the signal strength allows easier detection by radiotelescopes . to date ,",
    "analysis of the galactic synchrotron has been performed by several surveys at frequencies up to 2.7  ghz .",
    "these have been mainly concentrated on the galactic plane , where the signal is greater .",
    "the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ,  @xcite ) and the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ,  @xcite ) are interferometric surveys whose main goal is to map almost all the galactic plane at 1.4  ghz down to a 1  arcmin resolution .",
    "these surveys provide deep insight into many effects typical of galactic polarized emission ( e.g. , polarization horizons , faraday screens ) .",
    "however , because of their interferometric origin , these surveys are sensitive to angular scales no larger than the 30  arcmin of the telescope primary beam .",
    "the largest angular scales are instead covered by a single dish project : the effelsberg 1.4  ghz medium galactic latitude survey ( emls , @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "this covers the galactic plane up to medium latitudes ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the approximately 10  arcmin resolution allows emls to overlap the scales accessible by the two previous interferometric surveys , and their combination will provide full information on the galactic plane down to 1  arcmin .",
    "the galactic plane has been also surveyed at higher frequency by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "they covered about a half of the plane at 2.4 and 2.7  ghz , respectively , with the latitude coverage extends to @xmath15 .",
    "the mid galactic latitudes has been partially surveyed at 350  mhz by the westerbork survey  @xcite , which mapped the polarized emission at longitudes @xmath16170@xmath17 and up to @xmath18 .",
    "because of their lower frequency , these data are likely to be more affected by faraday rotation effects .",
    "the analysis of the galactic plane region has provided the first information on the angular behavior of the galactic synchrotron radiation ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . however , the optimal locations for observations of the cmbp are at high latitudes , where the emission is low .",
    "high latitude regions are not as well studied , although more recent surveys are starting to fill this gap , at least at 1.4  ghz",
    ".    sparse observations at all galactic latitudes were made in 1960s and 1970s ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) . among them , the observations presented by @xcite covered all galactic latitudes at 5 frequencies between 408 and 1411  mhz . for decades",
    "these have represented the largest data set of polarized measurements out of the galactic plane . although undersampled and not suitable for a full investigation of the synchrotron characteristics ( especially when dealing with the angular behavior ) some analyses of the angular power spectra have been carried out in the best sampled portions  @xcite . moreover , as we will see in this work , this data - set can provide useful information on the frequency behavior of the large angular scale structure .",
    "the whole of the northern and southern sky are being mapped by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , at 1.4  ghz .",
    "these surveys are very precious , since they will provide the first all - sky map of the polarized emission at 1.4  ghz down to the degree scale .",
    "they are sensitive to the large angular scale structure of the polarized emission in interesting ( for cmbp purposes ) low emission regions",
    ". however , their angular resolution ( larger than 30  arcmin ) and sensitivity ( about 15  mk ) do not allow the analysis of the faint areas required by sub - degree cmbp experiments , which require better resolution ( finer than 30  arcmin ) and sensitivity ( rms signal about 10  mk , see @xcite ) .",
    "all of the aforementioned surveys are at low frequencies , where the faraday rotation effects can still play a significant role .",
    "in fact , faraday rotation can introduce a randomization of polarization angles which transfers power from large to small angular scales by modifying the polarized emission pattern . although this transfer of power has been claimed to explain some results at frequencies up to 1.4  ghz ( e.g  @xcite ) , it has not been quantitatively studied .",
    "a detailed study is needed to evaluate its effect before we can safely extrapolate up to the mm - wave cosmological window .",
    "the patch of sky near @xmath2 and @xmath19 has been identified as an interesting area for cmbp investigations : it is at high galactic latitude ( @xmath1 ) and , from an analysis of the rhodes / hartrao 2326-mhz radio continuum survey @xcite , it is expected to have a synchrotron emission at the low level required for cmbp studies  @xcite . in fact , this region was chosen for the total intensity observation by the boomerang experiment and has been selected as target for bar - sport  @xcite and boomerang - b2k  @xcite .",
    "this patch has been observed in polarization at 1.4  ghz to a sensitivity to allow detection of the polarized synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "this represents the first detection of this emission at high galactic latitude at this frequency and in the angular scale range useful for cmbp analyses ( 530  arcmin ) .",
    "these observations , along with an initial analysis of the implications for cmbp studies , have been presented by @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we perform a more detailed analysis of the polarized emission in this area and reach firmer conclusions regarding cmbp implications .",
    "we quantatively analyse the effects of the polarization angle randomization introduced by faraday screens , finding that a power transfer from large to small angular scales occurs .",
    "this results both in a steepening of the ( angular ) spectral index and an enhancement of the observed emission on the angular scales our observations are sensitive to ( i.e. 330  arcmin ) .",
    "this implies that our measurements represent an upper limit of the intrinsic polarized emission .",
    "we present the angular power spectra of the @xmath4- and @xmath5-modes .",
    "comparison of these with other surveys suggests that the observed patch is an intermediate state between significant and negligible faraday rotation effects .",
    "finally , we extrapolate the spectra up to the frequency range of cmb measurements ( 3090  ghz ) .",
    "this suggests that the galactic synchrotron emission is low enough in this area that it should not be an issue for both the @xmath4-mode ( from 30  ghz ) and the fainter @xmath5-mode ( provided a tensor - to - scalar power ratio @xmath9 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ obssec ]",
    "we present a quick summary of the observations . in sections  [ pointsec ] and  [ rmsec ]",
    "we analyse the point sources detected in the field and the rotation measure ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "section  [ powtrsec ] discusses the power transfer from large to small angular scales as a result of randomization of polarization angles .",
    "it considers how this changes the polarized power spectrum .",
    "the @xmath4- and @xmath5-mode power spectra of the synchrotron emission in the patch will be presented in section  [ apssec ] together with an analysis of the role of faraday rotation effects .",
    "the implications for cmbp investigations are discussed in section  [ cmbpsec ] .",
    "summary and conclusions are finally presented in section  [ concsec ] .",
    "the region centred on ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) has been observed at 1.4  ghz by  @xcite using the australia telescope compact array ( atca , @xcite ) , an east - west synthesis interferometer situated near narrabri ( nsw , australia ) , operated by csiro - atnf .",
    "the observation was performed as a 49 pointing mosaic covering a @xmath21 region .",
    "the array configuration used was the so - called ew214 including spacing from 30  m to 214  m. this provides sensitivity on angular scales ranging from @xmath22  arcmin down to the resolution of @xmath23  arcmin .",
    "the system provides the four stokes parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "details of the observations are listed in table  [ obstab ] and presented in  @xcite .",
    ".main characteristics of the 1.4  ghz observations .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     [ slopetab ]    it is interesting to compare the amplitude and spectral index with information from other galactic surveys . first , let us consider the sgps test region @xcite .",
    "this covers a similar area ( about @xmath28 ) . like the current study ,",
    "the sgps test region survey is an interferometric observation at arcminute resolution and carried out at the same 1.4  ghz frequency .",
    "however , its region of interest is located on the galactic plane .",
    "the first significant difference is in the amplitude : sgps has a @xmath29  k@xmath30  @xcite , corresponding to a signal about 25 times stronger than in the patch of the current study .",
    "this is expected , as the observed patch is at high galactic latitudes .",
    "furthermore this is consistent with the result of  @xcite , which found that the mean signal of this patch is about 10 times smaller than the background emission in areas close to the galactic plane of the 1.4  ghz emls survey @xcite .",
    "however it is worth noting that the difference is not as large as the case with total intensity : in total intensity the differences between galactic plane and high galactic latitudes emissions can be much larger  for instance , see the full - sky surveys at 408  mhz  @xcite and 1.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "another area of significant difference is the slopes of the power spectra ( table  [ slopetab ] ) .",
    "the power laws in the observed patch have @xmath31 , which is considerably flatter than @xmath32 for the sgps  @xcite .",
    "however it is close to the @xmath33 found at 2.4  ghz in the region covered by the sgps , but using the data of @xcite @xcite .",
    "the latter agrees with the mean value @xmath34 measured at 2.42.7  ghz over a large portion of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the large difference between @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 was first addressed by  @xcite , who explained the steepening of the sgps through a faraday - rotation induced transfer of power from large to small scales .",
    "section  [ powtrsec ] provides a quantitative approach to this effect : faraday screens can introduce randomization in the polarization angle , which actually transfer power from large to small angular scales and , thus , increases the power and the slope on scales smaller than the randomization scale size .",
    "faraday rotation has a square dependence on the wavelength and the effects at 2.4  ghz are expected to be less significant than at 1.4  ghz . the flatter slope at 2.4  ghz can be interpreted as a reduction of the effects of faraday rotation . the slopes most probably are near the intrinsic value .",
    "moreover , in spite of a large variation of @xmath20s across the galactic plane , the slopes measured at 2.42.7  ghz have a small dispersion ( @xmath38 ) , indicating a good stability around the mean value .",
    "this further supports the idea that the 2.42.7  ghz slopes are slightly modified by faraday effects and are near the intrinsic values .",
    "our results are lie between the two previous values .",
    "in fact , pulsar and extragalactic source measurements show that the @xmath20 becomes less significant at high galactic latitudes : starting from the typical value @xmath39  @xmath40 at the galactic plane ( e.g.  @xcite ) , through 2030  @xmath40 at mid galactic latitudes @xcite and down to 1020  @xmath40 in the north galactic pole ( ngp ) ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "hence we would expect to see less impact of faraday rotation in the observed patch than in the sgps .",
    "we conclude that our observed patch is in an intermediate domain between significant and negligible faraday rotation effects .",
    "we have analysed the data of  @xcite , which has led us to a similar conclusion . in more detail",
    ", the data of @xcite give polarization observations of about a half of the sky at five frequencies : 408 , 465 , 610 , 820 , 1411  mhz . having the desirable characteristics of covering all the northern galactic latitudes and a wide range in frequency ,",
    "these data allow us to explore behavior in both frequency and latitude .     but using the modified cic scheme dealing with irregularly sampled data ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "an issue with this data - set is that it is sparsely sampled and arranged on irregular grids .",
    "while the lowest frequency case is tolerable ( the best sampled areas have about @xmath41 sampling versus a fwhm  =  @xmath42 ) the situation is worst at 1411  mhz , where fwhm  =  @xmath43 .",
    "nevertheless , regridding and smoothing on angular scales larger than the sampling distance allow the analysis of the characteristic of the emission at least for the large scale structure .    to account for irregular sampling , we regrid the data on regular healpix maps via linear interpolation , using a variant of the cic scheme . the standard cic deals with data sampled on a regular grid , as described in section  [ powtrsec ] .",
    "on the other hand , here the data are sampled on irregular grids .",
    "let ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) be the @xmath46 sample of the grid and @xmath47 the @xmath48 pixel of the map to be interpolated .",
    "referring to figure  [ cictrfig ] , we generalize the cic scheme finding the 3 grid points ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) which define the smallest triangle containing @xmath47 .",
    "connecting @xmath47 to @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , three triangular sub - cells can be identified .",
    "similarly to eq .",
    "( [ cic1eq ] ) , the linear interpolation is performed assigning to @xmath47 an average of the values sampled on these 3 grid points weighted for the area of the opposite sub - cell : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the quantity to be estimated at the pixel @xmath47 .",
    "the deformations of the 2-sphere space can generate depolarization due to the projection of @xmath25 and @xmath26 onto the local reference frame of parallels and meridians if a simple mean of the data is performed .",
    "close to the ngp , this will be a particular issue .",
    "following  @xcite , to avoid these projection effects , we perform a parallel transport of the polarization vectors ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) onto the interpolation point @xmath47 before averaging the data .    to account for the irregular sampling distance ,",
    "the interpolated data are smoothed with a gaussian filter of @xmath56  fwhm , leading to maps able to describe the large scale distribution of the polarized emission .",
    "the resultant maps at the 5 frequencies are shown in figure  [ bspifig ] .",
    "a feature is clearly visible in the fan region at galactic longitude @xmath57 at all frequencies .",
    "this region is close to the area where the line of sight is nearly perpendicular to the local galactic magnetic field .",
    "hence , there is only a small parallel magnetic field component , and so small faraday rotation effects .",
    "consequently the presence of a large non - depolarized region is not surprising , even at the lowest frequency .",
    "1.0 cm   1.0 cm   1.0 cm   1.0 cm   1.0 cm     for the current study , the area of most interest is at very high galactic latitudes .",
    "the north galactic spur , while depolarized at 408  mhz , becomes evident with increasing frequency .",
    "moreover , this structure is apparent at the highest latitudes first and propagates toward lower ones as frequency increases : while at 610  mhz the large scale polarized structure is evident only close to the ngp , at 820  mhz it is present down to @xmath58 and reaches @xmath59 at 1411  mhz .    the polarization angle maps exhibit similar behavior . while complex at low frequency , the polarization angle pattern becomes more regular in the ngp region at the highest frequencies . at 610  mhz , the region of ordered behavior",
    "is limited to the very high latitude areas .",
    "order expands to lower latitudes with increasing frequency , reaching @xmath59@xmath60 at 1411  mhz .",
    "it is easy to interpret this in light of the previous discussion .",
    "the randomization of the polarization angles due to faraday rotation , transferring the power from large to small scales , destroys the polarized emission on the largest scales at the lowest frequencies . at higher frequencies , the effects of faraday rotation decrease , leading to the re - appearing of the large scale structures",
    "this starts in the areas with smaller @xmath20 .",
    "considering the @xmath20 behavior with galactic latitudes , we expect that this would start at the very high latitudes and expand to the mid latitudes with increasing frequency , producing larger _ ordered _ regions showing the intrinsic structure .",
    "this analysis of the @xcite data supports that our patch , given the observing parameters ( at 1.4  ghz and @xmath61 ) , is in an intermediate state between strong and negligible influence of the faraday rotation .",
    "the @xmath4- and @xmath5-mode spectra of section  [ apssec ] are the first measurements for a high galactic latitude patch at 1.4 ghz on sub - degree scales ( i.e. scales on which cmbp has most of the power ) .",
    "other spectra out of the galactic plane ( @xmath62 ) have been measured by  @xcite , but at lower frequency ( @xmath63  mhz ) .",
    "their results show slopes with a very large distribution , suggesting significant changes of faraday rotation",
    ". however , a decrease in slope toward higher galactic latitudes seems to exist , in agreement with the interpretation given here .",
    "our data are at a significantly higher frequency and , being less affected by faraday rotation features , are to date the most suitable for extrapolation to the frequency range of cmb measurements .",
    "figure  [ cmbspecfig ] shows the @xmath4-mode spectrum extrapolated up to the 32 and 90  ghz frequencies of the bar - sport experiment , assumed the synchrotron follows a power law @xmath64 with spectral index @xmath65 , typical of the 1.423  ghz spectral range  @xcite .",
    "-mode spectrum measured for our data scaled up to 32 ( top ) and 90  ghz ( bottom ) .",
    "the spectrum expected for cmbp with cosmological parameters as from wmap results @xcite is also shown.,title=\"fig : \" ] -mode spectrum measured for our data scaled up to 32 ( top ) and 90  ghz ( bottom ) .",
    "the spectrum expected for cmbp with cosmological parameters as from wmap results @xcite is also shown.,title=\"fig : \" ]    these spectra include the correction for the square of the conversion factor @xmath66 ^ 2 , \\hskip 1 cm x = h\\nu / kt_{\\rm cmb}\\ ] ] transforming antenna into thermodynamic temperature of cmb ( @xmath67 is the frequency and @xmath68  k ) .",
    "the presence of faraday rotation effects makes the power in our images an upper limit to the intrinsic power on cmbp scales .",
    "hence , apart from errors in the frequency spectral index , these extrapolations represent an upper limit of the contamination on the cosmic signal .",
    "these results suggest that the synchrotron emission should only marginally contaminate the cosmological signal at 32  ghz , making this patch a good target for cmbp investigations . even assuming an error of @xmath69 on the power law",
    ", the contamination would be only a factor 2 stronger , which does not change the conclusion .",
    "the situation at 90  ghz is clearer still : the extrapolated spectrum is more than 4 orders of magnitude lower than the cosmic signal , leaving the cmbp practically uncontaminated by synchrotron pollution . including the steepening of the synchrotron spectral index above 23  ghz observed by the wmap team  @xcite , the conclusion is very robust .",
    "such low emission of the galactic synchtron makes this area promising even for the weak @xmath5-mode .",
    "-mode spectrum measured for our data scaled up to 90  ghz .",
    "@xmath5-mode spectra expected for cmbp with tensor - to - scalar perturbations power ratios @xmath70 and @xmath71 are also shown .",
    "the other cosmological parameters are as from wmap results  @xcite . ]",
    "its emission has a peak near @xmath72 , whereas our data cover only the @xmath73@xmath74 range . to compare the emissions , in figure  [ cmbspecbfig ]",
    "we extrapolate the synchrotron spectrum down to @xmath75 with the same slope of table  [ powfittab ] .",
    "in fact , since the slope we have measured at 1.4  ghz could be steeper than the intrinsic one , our estimate is somewhat conservative .",
    "figure  [ cmbspecbfig ] indicates that a model with tensor - to - scalar perturbation power ratio @xmath76 should be well accessible in this area , the synchrotron contribution being a factor 30 fainter than the cmbp spectrum .",
    "this gap makes the result quite robust to errors in the extrapolation .",
    "even more interesting is that a model with @xmath77 could be accessible in this part of the sky . at this low level",
    "it is likely that the leading contaminant will be the thermal dust , whose study requires measurements at higher frequencies ( hundreds of ghz ) .",
    "we have analysed the observation by  @xcite of the polarized emission at 1.4  ghz in the high galactic latitude area ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this represents the first detection of the galactic synchrotron polarized emission carried out in a low emission area at 1.4  ghz on this angular scale , giving us good data to estimate the contamination of the cmbp signal by the galactic synchrotron radiation .",
    "the contamination has been evaluated through the polarized angular power spectra @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "these follows a power law behavior with spectral indeces @xmath7 and @xmath81 . the emission level is about 25 times fainter than in galactic plane regions .",
    "extrapolations to the cmb frequency window ( 30100  ghz ) gives encouraging results : the @xmath4-mode of cmbp is expected to be safely accessible already at 32  ghz , while at 90  ghz the margin is much larger ensuring clean measurements of cmbp .",
    "the low contamination level makes this patch a good candidate for the detection of the weaker @xmath5-mode : the tensorial signal appears accessible for models with @xmath9 .    the analysis of the faraday rotation effects performed in this paper reinforces the robustness of our estimates .",
    "the low @xmath20 values measured in the patch",
    "( typically @xmath82  @xmath83 ) do not generate significant bandwidth depolarization .",
    "additionally , we have carried out a quantitative analysis of the effects caused by the randomization of the polarization angles as a result of faraday screens .",
    "we find an enhancement of the power on angular scales smaller than that of randomization , which ensures that the power we measure in the observed patch is an upper limit of the intrinsic emission  at least on the scales relevant for cmb purposes .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the faraday screen effects provides a second important result : a steepening of the power law index on angular scales smaller than that of randomization .",
    "the comparison between the slopes we have measured with those obtained by other surveys suggests the patch is in an intermediate state between significant and negligible faraday rotation effects .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached from an analysis of the data of  @xcite .",
    "depolarization effects are seen to decrease on the large scale polarized emission as the frequency increases from 408  mhz up to 1411  mhz .",
    "starting from the ngp at the lowest frequencies , the large scale emission appears down to @xmath59 at 1411  mhz .",
    "this further supports the conclusion that the galactic latitude of the observed patch is in an intermediate state between significant and negligible faraday rotation effects at 1.4  ghz .",
    "it appears that the patch is still affected by faraday effects , but that it is very close to showing the intrinsic emission .",
    "therefore , the estimates we have given here are conservative upper limits . observations at higher frequency should allow measurements which are not affected by faraday rotation .",

    "<S> the region , centred in ( @xmath2 ,  @xmath3 ) , was observed with the australia telescope compact array radio - interferometer , whose 330  arcmin angular sensitivity range allows the study of scales appropriate for cosmic microwave background polarization ( cmbp ) investigations . </S>",
    "<S> the angular behavior of the diffuse emission is analysed through the @xmath4- and @xmath5-mode angular power spectra . </S>",
    "<S> these follow a power law @xmath6 with slopes @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the emission is found to be about a factor 25 fainter than in galactic plane regions . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the power spectra with other surveys indicates that this area is intermediate between strong and negligible faraday rotation effects . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion can be reached by analysing both the frequency and galactic latitude behaviors of the diffuse galactic emission of the 408 - 1411  mhz leiden survey data . </S>",
    "<S> we present an analysis of the faraday rotation effects on the polarized power spectra , and find that the observed power spectra can be enhanced by a transfer of power from large to small angular scales . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation of the spectra to 32 and 90  ghz of the cmb window suggests that galactic synchrotron emission leaves the cmbp @xmath4-mode uncontaminated at 32  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the level of the contamination at 90  ghz is expected to be more than 4 orders of magnitude below the cmbp spectrum . extrapolating to the relevant angular scales </S>",
    "<S> , this region also appears adequate for investigation of the cmbp @xmath5-modes for models with tensor - to - scalar fluctuation power ratio @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify polarized point sources in the field , providing a 9 object list which is complete down to the polarized flux limit of @xmath10  mjy .    </S>",
