    "the size of cooper pairs in high - temperature cuprate superconductors is not much bigger than the average distance of conduction electrons in these materials.@xcite this experimental fact has dramatically increased the interest in electronic model systems where attractive interactions can lead to bound electron pairs of arbitrary size , between the bcs - limit of very large cooper pairs and the opposite bose limit , where the pairs are smaller than the average particle distance.@xcite already in 1980 leggett@xcite pointed out that the superconducting bcs ground state at weak coupling evolves smoothly into a bose condensate state at strong coupling , as a function of increasing interaction strength .",
    "nozires and schmitt - rink@xcite considered the bcs - bose crossover at finite temperatures and argued that also the transition temperature @xmath0 between the normal and superconducting ( or superfluid ) state should evolve continuously .    there has also been much interest in possible non - fermi liquid behavior of the _ normal _ phase of electron systems with attractive interactions . the hubbard model for lattice electrons with a purely local attractive interaction@xcite",
    "has become a prototype model in this context . a t - matrix calculation by frsard et al.@xcite for the attractive hubbard model showed convincingly that fermi liquid theory governs the normal phase for relatively weak coupling strength even in two dimensions , except for very low density .",

    "approximate theories beyond the t - matrix @xcite have produced quite strong pseudogap behavior at intermediate interaction strength in two dimensions.@xcite these results have been related to pseudogap phenomena in underdoped cuprate superconductors.@xcite    in this article we analyze the pair formation and related phenomena in the normal phase of the attractive hubbard model within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft).@xcite this approximation becomes exact in the limit of infinite lattice dimension.@xcite we solve the mean - field equations numerically at finite temperature .",
    "the results show that the normal state is a fermi liquid at weak coupling and a non - fermi liquid state characterized by bound electron pairs , the absence of fermionic quasi - particles and a spin gap at strong coupling , in qualitative agreement with the qmc studies of finite two- and three - dimensional systems.@xcite at very low temperatures the transition between the fermi liquid and the normal paired state is discontinuous , if the superconducting instability is suppressed .",

    "we have solved the attractive hubbard model within dmft.@xcite in contrast to other ( simpler ) mean - field approaches , dmft provides an exact solution of the model in the limit of infinite lattice dimensionality,@xcite since it captures local fluctuations exactly .    at weak coupling dmft incorporates the complete bcs physics , since it contains the feynman diagrams contributing to the bcs mean - field theory . at strong coupling , where the attractive hubbard model maps to the hard core bose gas , dmft reduces to the standard mean - field theory of the hard core bose gas.@xcite hence , bose - einstein condensation of preformed pairs is obtained at a critical temperature of order @xmath23 at large @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the coordination number of the lattice .    within dmft the fluctuating environment of any lattice site is replaced by a local but dynamical effective field @xmath31.@xcite the mean - field equations involve the calculation of the propagator @xmath32 of an effective single - site hubbard model coupled to the dynamical field @xmath33 , and a self - consistency condition relating @xmath34 to the local propagator of the full lattice system .",

    "the dmft equations can also be extended to superconducting or other symmetry broken phases.@xcite in this work we focus however on normal state properties .    the effective single - site problem appearing in the dmft for the hubbard model can be related to the anderson model of a single hubbard impurity coupled via a hybridization term to a bath of non - interacting conduction electrons.@xcite integrating out the conduction electrons of this model yields an effective action of the form ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the weiss field is determined by the parameters of the anderson model as @xmath49 where the hybridization spectral density @xmath50 is given by the conduction band energy levels @xmath51 and the corresponding hybridization matrix elements @xmath52 of the anderson model as @xmath53 the effective single - site problem ( [ s ] ) can not be solved analytically .",

    "quarter - filling is well below half - filling but still high enough to see collective many - body effects , which are not obtained in the low - density limit .",

    "for @xmath65 the chemical potential is a monotonously decreasing function of temperature .",
    "results for the critical temperature @xmath66 for the onset of superconductivity at quarter - filling have been presented in our recent letter@xcite and will not be reproduced here . at half - filling @xmath66 has been computed already much earlier by freericks et al.@xcite by virtue of the particle - hole symmetry at half - filling the critical temperature is equal to the nel temperature of the repulsive hubbard model in that case .",
    "@xmath66 is exponentially small at weak coupling and approaches the bose - limit ( [ tcbose ] ) for strong coupling , as expected . at all coupling strengths",

    "of course these solutions do not minimize the free energy , but they could be stabilized by the field energy of a sufficiently strong external magnetic field .      at weak coupling",
    "the normal state of the system is a fermi liquid with fermionic quasi - particle excitations . besides numerical evidence ( see below ) this follows@xcite from the analyticity of weak coupling perturbation theory for the effective single - site problem .",
    "by contrast , at sufficiently strong coupling @xmath67 and zero temperature all particles should be bound in pairs , because a small kinetic energy can not overcome a finite binding energy . at low finite temperatures",
    "@xmath68 only an exponentially small fraction of pairs dissociates .",
    "our dmft results at strong coupling are indeed characterized by the absence of fermionic low - energy excitations and a spin gap associated with the binding in singlet pairs .",
    "a direct measure for local pair formation is the _",
    "local pair density _ , that is the density of doubly occupied sites @xmath69 . for an uncorrelated state",
    "the density of doubly occupied sites is simply the product of the average density of up and down spin particles , i.e.  @xmath70 .",
    "an attractive interaction enhances @xmath71 . in the limit of infinite attraction",
    "all particles are bound as local pairs such that @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "1 we show results for @xmath73 for various @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath74 the density of doubly occupied sites tends to @xmath75 , corresponding to an uncorrelated state .",
    "for decreasing temperature @xmath73 first increases as a consequence of the attractive interaction . for small or moderate @xmath2",
    ", however , @xmath73 slightly decreases again at low temperatures .",
    "this effect , which has also been obtained in a combined dmft + tma calculation,@xcite can be attributed to the kinetic energy , which tends to dissociate pairs if the attraction is not too strong .",
    "note that in the pairing regime for stronger @xmath2 the upturn in @xmath73 at low temperatures is missing .",
    "the kinetic energy is not able to unbind pairs any more . for the largest @xmath28 values",
    "@xmath73 becomes very flat at low temperatures , which indicates the presence of an energy gap for excitations .",
    "a completely analogous ( particle - hole transformed ) behavior has been found in the dmft solution of the repulsive hubbard model at half - filling.@xcite    the binding of all electrons in singlet pairs in the pairing state at strong coupling leads to a _ spin gap _ , which can be observed most directly in the _ spin susceptibility_. in fig .",
    "2 we show our dmft results for the temperature dependence    of the spin susceptibility @xmath76 , for various coupling strengths .",
    "the results have been obtained by computing the spin - spin correlation function , which yields much more accurate data than the alternative route via numerical diffentiation of the magnetization in a small external magnetic field . due to a rather strong @xmath61-dependence of the data a @xmath61-extrapolation had to be performed here . for a weak attraction",
    "the spin susceptibility increases monotonously for lower temperatures and then saturates at a finite value for @xmath77 , as expected for a fermi liquid . for strong coupling",
    ", however , @xmath76 decreases rapidly at low temperatures , as expected for a system where spin excitations are gapped .",
    "this gap , which has also been seen in qmc simulations of the two - dimensional@xcite and three - dimensional@xcite hubbard model , is clearly due to the binding energy of singlet pairs in the non - fermi liquid state forming at strong coupling . for a moderate attraction , _ pseudogap _",
    "behavior seems to set in at intermediate temperatures , but for small @xmath78 the susceptibility increases again and finally tends to a non - zero value . in our earlier work@xcite we attributed this behavior to the presence of a narrow quasi - particle band in the system , similar to the one known for the repulsive model near the mott transition.@xcite the very recent results for the spectral function at quarter - filling by capone et al.@xcite indeed confirm this expectation .",
    "results for the _ specific heat _",
    "@xmath79 are shown in fig .",
    "the specific heat is obtained by numerically differentiating the results for the internal energy @xmath80 , which unfortunately amplifies the statistical fluctuations in the monte - carlo data quite drastically .",
    "we therefore show only results at relatively high temperature , where the ising spin configurations in the hirsch - fye algorithm can still be enumerated exactly .",
    "nevertheless one can clearly see that the specific heat exhibits activated behavior with an energy gap for large @xmath28 . in the fermi liquid regime for small @xmath28 the specific heat must vanish linearly for @xmath77 , but this asymptotic behavior sets in only at rather low temperatures , even for very moderate @xmath28 .",
    "in the strongly correlated fermi liquid regime for intermediate @xmath2 the additional energy scale observed already in the spin susceptibility is also visible in the specific heat : @xmath79 first decreases at intermediate temperatures @xmath81 , before increasing again ( at @xmath82 ) or at least saturating ( at @xmath83 ) at a lower scale .",
    "ultimately @xmath79 must of course vanish linearly in the zero temperature limit for @xmath2-values in the fermi liquid regime .",
    "the existence of an energy gap in the specific heat implies that there are no low energy excitations at all in the pair phase .",
    "we emphasize that this is an artefact of the dmft , which does not take into account the contributions from the low - energy bosonic degrees of freedom to the specific heat . to see how this comes about",
    "let us consider the limit of high lattice dimensionality ( coordination number @xmath45 ) , with the scaling of the hopping amplitude @xmath84.@xcite the dmft solves the hubbard model exactly in that limit .",
    "the scaling of @xmath85 has been chosen such that the average kinetic energy of the electrons has a finite limit for @xmath45 , but the effective hopping amplitude @xmath86 of the composite bosons forming for large @xmath28 is proportional to @xmath87 , such that the average kinetic energy of the bosons is suppressed by a factor @xmath88 in the limit @xmath45 . only in a bose condensate",
    "the kinetic energy contributions of all bonds on the lattice add up coherently to a finite total kinetic energy .",
    "the situation is completely analogous to that for the repulsive hubbard model , where the spin exchange energy @xmath89 is suppressed as @xmath88 , and thus yields a finite energy gain only via magnetic ordering in the large @xmath30 limit.@xcite    the momentum distribution function @xmath90 also behaves differently in the fermi liquid phase and the pair phase , respectively . within dmft , where the self - energy is momentum - independent",
    ", @xmath91 depends only via the single particle energy @xmath92 on @xmath93 , defining thus an _  energy distribution function",
    " _ @xmath94 .",
    "an analogous definition works also for the bethe lattice or other systems where single particle states are labeled by other quantum numbers than momentum . in fig .",
    "4 we show results for @xmath94 for different choices of @xmath2 .",
    "one can clearly see that @xmath94 changes curvature near the fermi level , if @xmath2 is in the fermi liquid regime , while the energy distribution function becomes convex in the pair phase .",
    "hence there is nothing like a fermi surface in the pair phase .",
    "we now analyze the phase transition between the fermi liquid at weak coupling and the pair phase at strong coupling in more detail .",
    "since the fermi liquid state is qualitatively different from the pair state , there has to be a sharply defined _ pairing transition _ at some critical attraction @xmath95 at least in the ground state . at finite temperature",
    "one may expect either a genuine phase transition or , alternatively , a smooth ( possibly very steep ) crossover . at half - filling",
    "the attractive hubbard model is equivalent to the spin - symmetric repulsive model , for which the existence of a _ first order _ phase transition between the fermi liquid and the paramagnetic mott phase at sufficiently low finite temperatures is well established.@xcite the first order transition line in the @xmath96-plane is embedded in a region where two different solutions of the dmft equations , with fermi liquid and mott insulator properties , respectively , coexist .",
    "the particle - hole binding characterizing the mott phase translates into particle - particle binding in the attractive case .",
    "away from half - filling the attractive hubbard model maps to the repulsive model at half - filling with a finite magnetization . for that model laloux et al.@xcite have solved the dmft equations with an exact diagonalization algorithm , finding coexisting solutions also away from the spin symmetric case .",
    "the results of their work imply that at sufficiently low temperatures a first order pairing transition occurs in the attractive hubbard model also away from half - filling .    to see how the fermi liquid phase breaks down upon increasing the attraction strength ,",
    "we have computed the renormalization factor @xmath97^{-1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the self - energy and @xmath99 the smallest ( positive ) matsubara frequency at temperature @xmath78 . in fig .",
    "5 we plot @xmath100 as a function of @xmath78 for various @xmath2 at quarter - filling .",
    "the inset shows the low - temperature behavior of @xmath100 and its quadratic extrapolation to @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting extrapolated values of @xmath101 at @xmath102 are presented in fig .  6 , where the corresponding results at half - filling are also shown for comparison ( see inset ) .    at half - filling",
    "we find that @xmath101 decreases continuously as a function of increasing @xmath28 in the fermi liquid phase until it vanishes , and remains zero in the pair phase , as is well established for the equivalent repulsive hubbard model.@xcite at quarter - filling the behavior is very different : @xmath101 first decreases as a function of @xmath28 in the fermi liquid regime , goes through a minimum , and then increases again in the pair phase .",
    "obviously @xmath101 is finite also in the pair phase for electron densities away from half - filling .    in the fermi liquid phase @xmath101",
    "has a multiple physical meaning : @xmath101 is the spectral weight for quasi - particles , the fermi edge discontinuity in the momentum distribution function and , within dmft , also the inverse mass renormalization .",
    "this meaning is of course lost in the bound pair state .",
    "however , the finiteness of @xmath101 does not imply that the system is a fermi liquid .",
    "obviously it does not even imply that there are low - energy excitations in the system .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath101 is finite even in the atomic limit @xmath103 for @xmath16 , where the system is obviously not a fermi liquid .",
    "our numerical data suggest that the minimum value of @xmath101 ( as a function of @xmath2 ) is small but finite at quarter - filling , but there remains an uncertainty due to the extrapolation from finite to zero temperature .",
    "most recently capone et al.@xcite have clarified this point by solving the dmft equations via an exact diagonalization algorithm@xcite which works directly at zero temperature .",
    "they found that the minimal @xmath101 at quarter - filling is indeed tiny but finite .",
    "it is instructive to consider lower densities for comparison . in the extreme low density limit @xmath104 the bound pair state is stable once the attraction exceeds the threshold for two - particle binding @xmath105 .",
    "for @xmath106 no bound states exist , and the particles move essentially freely , due to the low density , and @xmath101 is almost one even close to the pairing transition . in fig .",
    "7 we show results for @xmath101 , as obtained from a zero temperature extrapolation of our finite temperature data at filling factor one eighth ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "one can see two trends , compared to quarter - filling : the minimum shifts towards smaller @xmath28 , moving thus closer to the still smaller @xmath108 , and the minimum value is now significantly higher , such that its finiteness can be concluded with more confidence from our data .",
    "that the behavior of the @xmath101-factor in the symmetric case is different from the generic scenario is plausible also from the following _  kondo  _ point of view , which is most easily visualized for the repulsive model . in",
    "the spin symmetric case ( no magnetization ) the spin degree of freedom of the impurity atom in the effective single impurity anderson model is degenerate . in the strongly correlated fermi liquid",
    "the effective anderson model is in the kondo regime , and the narrow quasi - particle peak in the ( interacting ) density of states is associated with the kondo resonance of the anderson model.@xcite a magnetic field lifts the spin degeneracy and thus destroys the kondo resonance at least at low energy scales .",
    "hence it is hard to believe that the symmetric transition scenario , where the quasi - particle peak vanishes continuously by becoming increasingly narrow , survives in the asymmetric case . in the attractive case",
    "it is the degeneracy between empty and doubly occupied sites which plays the role of the spin degeneracy for the repulsive model .",
    "the above - mentioned existence of coexisting fermi liquid and pair solutions , which has been obtained in particle - hole transformed form already by laloux et al.@xcite for the repulsive hubbard model , has been confirmed in detail by capone et al.@xcite using the hirsch - fye algorithm it is not easy to access sufficiently low temperatures to reach the coexistence region in the @xmath96 plane , especially away from half - filling , where the computation of the chemical potential requires additional self - consistency loops .",
    "nevertheless we have found some cases where a fermi liquid and a pair solution coexists .",
    "an example at quarter - filling is shown in fig .",
    "both green functions are fully converged self - consistent solutions of the dmft equations , with a time discretization @xmath109 and @xmath110 monte carlo sweeps in each iteration .",
    "the actual phase transition takes place inside the coexistence region . to determine the transition line in the @xmath96-plane one would have to compare the free energies of the two solutions .",
    "since the @xmath101-factor decreases as a function of @xmath28 in the fermi liquid solution and increases in the pair solution , it is clear that @xmath101 is minimal at the transition point .",
    "in summary , within dmft two distinct normal low temperature phases are found for the attractive hubbard model at arbitrary filling factor : a fermi liquid phase at weak coupling and a singlet pair phase characterized by a spin gap and the absence of fermionic quasi - particles at strong coupling .",
    "the transition between the two phases is generally first order and occurs at an intermediate critical coupling @xmath95 of the order of the bandwidth , which is maximal at half - filling and ( most probably ) minimal in the low - density limit @xmath104 .",
    "our numerical results , especially at filling factor one eighth , the numerical results by capone et al.,@xcite and analytical arguments all indicate that the fermi liquid ground state disappears with a finite @xmath101 at @xmath95 at electron densities @xmath16 , such that in contrast to the special half - filled case the quasi - particle weight disappears discontinuously at the pairing transition .",
    "the dmft provides an exact solution of the hubbard model in the limit of infinite lattice dimension ( or coordination number ) . as an approximation for the two- or three - dimensional model it captures at least the most gross features of the normal phase , that is fermi liquid behavior at weak coupling and a singlet pair liquid with a spin gap at strong coupling . the instability towards a superfluid state at an exponentially small temperature scale at weak coupling and at a scale of order @xmath23 is also described by dmft .",
    "the bosonic degrees of freedom in the pair phase are however poorly treated by dmft .",
    "their kinetic energy is taken into account only in a bose condensate , while in the normal phase the pairs do not move .",
    "gapless bosonic excitations , which are present in any finite dimension , are absent in dmft .    within dmft , the development of the gap in the normal phase is accompanied by a complete destruction of the fermi edge in the momentum distribution function .",
    "furthermore , there is not even a trace of pseudo gap behavior at weak coupling .",
    "this is different in two dimensions , where superconducting fluctuations lead to a small pseudo gap in the normal phase close to @xmath0 already at weak coupling,@xcite and a rather strong pseudo gap develops at moderate coupling strength in a regime where the momentum distribution function still exhibits a pronounced fermi edge.@xcite",
