    "in a recent article @xcite , we have derived exact results for both the temperature @xmath0 and external ordering field @xmath1 behavior of the order parameter profile and the corresponding response functions  local and total susceptibilities  within the three - dimensional continuum mean - field ginzburg - landau ising type model of a simple fluid or binary liquid mixture for a system with a film geometry @xmath2 . in the current article",
    "we extend them to derive exact results for the thermodynamic casimir force within the same model .",
    "we concentrate in the region of the parametric space in @xmath3 plane close to the critical point of the fluid or close to the demixing point of the binary liquid mixture .",
    "we recall that for a simple fluid or for binary liquid mixtures the wall generically prefers one of the fluid phases or one of the components . because of that in the current article we study the case when the bounding surfaces of the system strongly prefer one of the phases of the system . since in such systems one observes also the phenomena of the capillary condensation close below the critical point for small negative values of the ordering field @xmath4 , we will also study the behavior of the force between the confining surfaces of the system in that parametric region .",
    "let us recall that the model we are going to consider is a standard model within which one studies phenomena like critical adsorption @xcite , wetting or drying @xcite , surface phenomena @xcite , capillary condensation @xcite , localization - delocalization phase transition @xcite , finite - size behavior of thin films @xcite , the thermodynamic casimir effect @xcite , etc .",
    "until very recently , i.e. before ref .",
    "@xcite , the results for the case @xmath5 were derived analytically @xcite while the @xmath1-dependence was studied numerically either at the bulk critical point of the system @xmath6 , or along some specific isotherms  see , e.g. , @xcite . in the current article we are going to improve this situation with respect to the casimir force by deriving exact analytical results for it in the @xmath3 plane .    in 1948",
    "@xcite , after a discussion with nils bohr @xcite , the dutch physicist h. b. g. casimir realized that the zero - point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in vacuum lead to a force of attraction between two perfectly conducting plates and calculated this force . in 1978",
    "fisher and de gennes @xcite pointed out that a very similar effect exists in fluids with the fluctuating field being the field of its order parameter , in which the interactions in the system are mediated not by photons but by different type of massless excitations such as critical fluctuations or goldstone bosons ( spin waves ) .",
    "nowadays one usually terms the corresponding casimir effect the critical or the thermodynamic casimir effect @xcite .",
    "currently the casimir effect , in its general form , is object of studies in quantum electrodynamics , quantum chromodynamics , cosmology , condensed matter physics , biology and , some elements of it , in nano - technology .",
    "the critical casimir effect has been already directly observed , utilizing light scattering measurements , in the interaction of a colloid spherical particle with a plate @xcite both of which are immersed in a critical binary liquid mixture . indirectly , as a balancing force that determines the thickness of a wetting film in the vicinity of its bulk critical point the casimir force has been also studied in @xmath7he @xcite , @xcite , as well as in @xmath8he@xmath7he mixtures @xcite . in @xcite and",
    "@xcite measurements of the casimir force in thin wetting films of binary liquid mixture are also performed .",
    "the studies in the field have also enjoined a considerable theoretical attention .",
    "reviews on the corresponding results can be found in @xcite .    before turning exclusively to the behavior of the casimir force ,",
    "let us briefly remind some basic facts of the theory of critical phenomena . in the vicinity of the bulk",
    "critical point @xmath9 the bulk correlation length of the order parameter @xmath10 becomes large , and theoretically diverges : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the usual critical exponents and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the corresponding nonuniversal amplitudes of the correlation length along the @xmath18 and @xmath1 axes . if in a finite system @xmath10 becomes comparable to @xmath19 , the thermodynamic functions describing its behavior depend on the ratio @xmath20 and take scaling forms given by the finite - size scaling theory .",
    "for such a system the finite - size scaling theory @xcite predicts :    @xmath21 for the casimir force @xmath22    @xmath21 for the order parameter profile @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 . in eqs .",
    "( [ cas ] ) and ( [ mfss ] ) , @xmath26 is the critical exponent for the order parameter , @xmath27 is the dimension of the system , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are nonuniversal metric factors that can be fixed , for a given system , by taking them to be , e.g. , @xmath30^{1/\\nu}$ ] , and @xmath31^{\\delta/\\nu}$ ] .",
    "here , as in @xcite , we consider a critical system of ising type in a parallel film geometry described by the minimizers of the standard @xmath32 ginzburg - landau hamiltonian @xmath33 = \\int_0^l { \\cal l}(\\phi,\\phi ' ) dz,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 here @xmath19 is the film thickness , @xmath35 is the order parameter assumed to depend on the perpendicular position @xmath36 only , @xmath37 is the bare reduced temperature , @xmath1 is the external ordering field , @xmath38 is the bare coupling constant and the primes indicate differentiation with respect to the variable @xmath39 .",
    "the thermodynamic casimir force is the excess pressure over the bulk one acting on the boundaries of the system which is due to the finite size of the system . to derive this excess pressure",
    "there are several ways but probably the most straightforward one is to apply the corresponding mathematical results of the variational calculus . for example , following gelfand and fomin @xcite it is easy to show that the functional derivative of @xmath40 with respect to the independent variable @xmath39 at @xmath41 is @xmath42 having in mind eq .",
    "( [ fdefising ] ) , one derives explicitly @xmath43 this derivative has the meaning of a force acting on the surface of the system at @xmath41 and , since @xmath40 is normalized per unit area , it has a meaning of a pressure acting on that surface .",
    "that is why , the notation @xmath44 is used .",
    "another common way to proceed is to use the apparatus based on the stress tensor operator see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite @xmath45 it is elementary to check that the expression in the parentheses in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "[ dz ] coincides with @xmath46 component of the stress tensor . in @xcite , we have shown that this expression is a first integral of the considered system , and therefore @xmath46 and @xmath44 do not depend on the coordinate @xmath39 at which they are calculated .    in the bulk system ,",
    "the gradient term in @xmath47 is absent and instead of @xmath48 one obtains @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the order parameter of the bulk system .",
    "clearly , @xmath50 is determined by the cubic equation @xmath51+h=0,$ ] @xmath50 being such that @xmath52 attains its minimum .",
    "now , one can immediately determine the casimir force as @xmath53 when @xmath54 the excess pressure will be inward of the system that corresponds to an _ attraction _ of the surfaces of the system towards each other and to a _ repulsion _ if @xmath55",
    ".    in the light of the above it is evident that once the order parameter profile @xmath56 is known in analytic form for given values of the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath1 , then the corresponding casimir force is determined exactly .",
    "it is noteworthy that the above expressions do not depend on the specific choice of the boundary conditions . in the current article",
    "we specialize to the so - called @xmath57 boundary conditions under which one requires that @xmath58 .",
    "the exact solution for @xmath59 for this case has been determined in @xcite . in what follows we will study the properties of the force @xmath60 using this exact solution .    .",
    "the inset on the right shows the pre - capillary - condensation curve , determined in @xcite , where above @xmath61 and below @xmath62 the jump the order parameter at the middle of the system is from a less dense gas to a more dense one . for @xmath63",
    "the system jumps from a ",
    "gas  to a  liquid  state . ]",
    "since the thermodynamic casimir force is normally presented in terms of the scaling variables @xmath64 @xmath65 in the remainder we are going to use such variables as the basic parameters determining the behavior of the force . in the above we have taken into account that for the model considered here @xmath66 @xcite , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the phase diagram of this model has been studied in details in @xcite . here , for the convenience of the reader , it is depicted in figure [ fig : pd ] in terms of the scaling variables @xmath69 and @xmath70 .      in terms of the scaling variables given in equations ( [ isvarxt ] ) and ( [ isvarxh ] ) ,",

    "( [ dz ] ) , becomes @xmath71 where the constant @xmath72 is @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the scaling function of the order parameter @xmath56 , @xmath75 and hereafter the prime means differentiation with respect to the variable @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "similarly , for the bulk system , see eq .",
    "( [ pb ] ) , one has @xmath77 where @xmath78 from eqs .",

    "if there is more than one such solution @xmath94 , as explained in detail in @xcite , we take that one which leads to an order parameter profile that corresponds to the minimum of the energy functional ( [ fviafising ] ) @xmath95 where @xmath96 the precise mathematical procedure how this can be achieved , despite the divergence of the energy , is also explained in details in @xcite .",

    "it should be pointed out that the solutions @xmath85 of the transcendental equation ( [ treq ] ) that correspond to certain values of the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 are to be obtained numerically identifying by inspection those of them that obey the conditions formulated above .",
