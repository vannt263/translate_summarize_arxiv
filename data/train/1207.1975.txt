    "turbulent flow occurs in the natural environmental and in technological applications with such frequency that it could be considered the `` natural '' state of fluid flows to be found around us .",
    "traditionally , fluid flows have been observed and studied in the eulerian perspective where a fixed position is observed for a definite interval of time .",
    "the other perspective , the lagrangian , follows the motion of the fluid and thus is better suited to study aspects of fluid flow such as material transport or the deformation of fluid material in a given state of motion .",
    "the use of stretching quantifiers such as the lyapunov exponents , which measure the relative separation between particles @xcite , has broadly improved the lagrangian study of fluid flows . on the one hand lyapunov methods",
    "provide information on time scales for dispersion processes , with its relevance for mixing and stirring of fluids @xcite . on the other",
    ", they are useful to detect the so - called lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs ) .",
    "lcss @xcite are templates for particle advection in complex flows , separating regions with different dynamical behavior and acting as barriers and avenues to transport , fronts or eddy boundaries @xcite",
    ".    relationships of lcss with lyapunov fields have been established for the case of finite - time lyapunov exponents ( ftles ) @xcite .",
    "these relationships state that lcs can be identified with the ridges ( generalized maxima ) of the ftle field .",
    "furthermore they state that the flux through the lcs is inversely proportional to the strength of the ridge and to the integration time of the ftle field calculation .",
    "this flux is shown to be small and the lcs extracted as the ridges of ftle fields are considered to be almost material - like surfaces .",
    "this identification has become widely used in the field although it should be mentioned that there are other more precise definitions of lcs @xcite , that consider lcs to be exact material surfaces admitting zero flux across them . in our work ,",
    "we use instead finite - size lyapunov exponents ( fsles ) , which quantify the separation rate of fluid particles between two given distance thresholds @xcite .",
    "they turn out to be convenient for the case of bounded flows in which characteristic spatial scales are more direct to identify than temporal ones and have been shown to be robust with respect to noisy or poorly resolved velocity fields @xcite .",
    "although a rigorous connection between the fsle and lcss has not been established yet , previous work @xcite has shown that the ridges of the fsle behave in a similar fashion as the ridges of the ftle field . following these works",
    "we assume that lcss can be computed as ridges of fsles , and that they are transported by the flow as almost material surfaces / lines , with negligible flux of particles through them .",
    "observations presented here are consistent with those assumptions .    despite its relevance in real flows ,",
    "the full three - dimensional ( 3d ) structure of lcss is still an open subject . in 3d flows ,",
    "lcs were explored in atmospheric contexts @xcite , and in a turbulent channel flow at @xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "a kinematic abc flow was studied in @xcite . in the ocean , where it is widely recognized that filamental structures , eddies , and in general oceanic meso- and submeso - scale structures have a great influence on marine ecosystems @xcite , the identification of lcss and the study of their role in the transport of biogeochemical tracers has primarily been restricted to two - dimensional ( 2d ) layers @xcite .",
    "there are two concurrent reasons for this : a ) because of stratification and rotation , vertical motions in the ocean are usually very small when compared to horizontal displacements ; b ) synoptic measurements ( e.g. from satellites ) of relevant quantities are restricted to the surface .",
    "a few previous results for lagrangian eddies in 3d were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , by applying the methodology of lobe dynamics and the turnstile mechanism . also ,",
    "@xcite used 3d fsle fields to identify lcs in oceanic flows .",
    "in particular , a mesoscale eddy in the southern atlantic was studied in @xcite , and it was shown that oceanic lcss presented a vertical curtain - like shape , i.e. they look mostly like vertical sheets , and that material transport into and out of the mesoscale eddy occurred through filamentary deformation of such structures .    in this paper , we use 3d fields of fsle to identify lcss in a turbulent channel flow and in an oceanic flow .",
    "observations of the similarities and differences between the two systems , both in their computation and their physical meaning , helps to appreciate the power and scope of this lagrangian technique in the analysis of fluid flows . in section [ sec : methods ] we describe the methodology used to identify lcss in 3d turbulent flows .",
    "sections [ sec : channel_flow ] and [ sec : ocean_flow ] are devoted to the turbulent channel flow and the oceanic flow , respectively , and section [ sec : conclus ] presents our conclusions and directions for future work .",
    "in order to study non - asymptotic dispersion processes such as stretching at finite scales and bounded domains , the finite size lyapunov exponent was introduced @xcite .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the time it takes for the separation between two particles , initially @xmath3 , to reach a value @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to the dependence on the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the fsle depends also on the initial position of the particles and on the time of deployment .",
    "locations ( i.e. initial positions ) leading to high values of this lyapunov field identify regions of strong separation between particles , i.e. , regions that will exhibit strong stretching during evolution , that can be identified with the lcs @xcite .    in principle , to compute fsle in 3d , the method of @xcite",
    "can be extended to include the third dimension , by computing the time it takes for particles initially separated by @xmath7^{1/2}$ ] to reach a final distance of @xmath8^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "we will proceed this way for the turbulent channel , but , as indicated in @xcite , vertical displacements are much smaller than horizontal ones in ocean flows .",
    "therefore , the displacement in the @xmath9 direction does not contribute significatively to the calculation of @xmath6 in the ocean , which prompt us to implement a quasi-3d computation of fsles : we use the full 3d velocity field for particle advection but particles are initialized in 2d horizontal ocean layers and the contribution @xmath10 is not considered when computing @xmath6 ( see more details in @xcite ) . in any case , since we allow the full 3d trajectories of particles , we take into account the vertical dynamics of the oceanic flows .    .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    concerning the turbulent channel , where we can implement a fully 3d computation of the fsle , we proceed as follows .",
    "a grid of initial locations @xmath11 is set up at time @xmath12 , fixing the spatial resolution of the fsle field ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "particles are released from each grid point and their three - dimensional trajectories are calculated .",
    "the distances of each neighbor particle with respect to the central one ( initially @xmath5 ) is monitored until one of the separations reaches a value @xmath4 .",
    "in both systems considered , we obtain two different types of fsle maps by integrating the three - dimensional particle trajectories backward and forward in time : the attracting lcss ( for the backward ) , and the repelling lcss ( forward ) @xcite .",
    "we obtain in this way fsle fields with a spatial resolution given by @xmath5 .",
    "when a particle leaves the velocity field domain or reaches a no - slip boundary , the fsle value at its initial position and initial time is set to zero . if the interparticle separation remains smaller than @xmath4 past a maximum integration time @xmath13 , then the fsle for that location is also set to zero .",
    "the identification of lcs calculated from lyapunov fields in 2d flows is straightforward since they practically coincide with ( finite - time ) stable and unstable manifolds of relevant hyperbolic structures in the flow @xcite ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of these manifolds in 3d is generally much more complex than in 2d @xcite , and they can be locally either lines or surfaces .    differently than 2d , where lcs can be visually identified as the maxima of the fsle field , in 3d they are hidden within the volume data and one needs to explicitly compute and extract them , using the definition of lcss as the ridges of the fsle field . a ridge @xmath14 is a co - dimension 1 orientable , differentiable manifold ( which means that for a 3d domain @xmath15 , ridges are surfaces ) satisfying the following conditions @xcite :    1 .",
    "the field @xmath16 attains a local extremum at @xmath14 .",
    "the direction perpendicular to the ridge is the direction of fastest descent of @xmath16 at @xmath14 .",
    "the method used to extract the ridges from the scalar field @xmath17 is from @xcite .",
    "it uses an earlier @xcite definition of ridge in the context of image analysis , as a generalized local maxima of scalar fields . for a scalar field @xmath18 with gradient @xmath19 and hessian @xmath20 , a _",
    "d_-dimensional height ridge is given by the conditions    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , are the eigenvalues of @xmath20 , ordered such that @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the eigenvector of @xmath20 associated with @xmath25 . for @xmath26 , eq . ( [ ridg1 ] ) becomes    @xmath27    in other words , in @xmath28 the @xmath29 eigenvectors point locally along the ridge and the @xmath30 eigenvector is orthogonal to it , so the ridge maximizes the scalar field in the normal direction to it and in this direction the field is more convex than in any other direction , since the eigenvector associated with the most negative eigenvalue is oriented along the direction of maximum negative curvature of the scalar field .",
    "the extraction process progresses by calculating the points where the ridge conditions are verified and the ridge strength @xmath31 is higher than a predefined threshold @xmath32 so that ridge points whose value of @xmath33 is lower ( in absolute value ) than @xmath32 are discarded from the extraction process .",
    "since the ridges are constructed by triangulations of the set of extracted ridge points , the strength threshold greatly determines the size and shape of the extracted ridge , by filtering out regions of the ridge that have low strength .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for details about the ridge extraction method .",
    "the height ridge definition has been used to extract lcs from ftle fields in several works ( see , among others , @xcite ) .    since the @xmath16 value of a point on the ridge and the ridge strength @xmath33",
    "are only related through the expressions ( [ ridg1 ] ) and ( [ ridg2 ] ) , the relationship between the two quantities is not direct , which makes difficult to choose the appropriate strength threshold @xmath32 .",
    "a too small value of @xmath32 will result in the extraction of very small lcss that appear to have little influence on the dynamics , while a large value will result in only a partial rendering of the larger and more significant lcs , limiting the possibility of observing their real impact on the flow .",
    "the ridges extracted from the backward fsle map approximate the attracting lcss , and the ridges extracted from the forward fsle map approximate the repelling lcss .",
    "the attracting ones are the more interesting from a physical point of view @xcite , since particles ( or any passive scalar driven by the flow ) typically approach them and spread along them , so that they are good candidates to be identified with the typical filamentary structures observed in tracer advection .",
    "turbulent channel flow is a turbulent flow between two stationary , parallel walls separated by a distance @xmath34 .",
    "it has been studied extensively due to its geometrical simplicity and its wall - bounded nature , which makes it a suitable platform to study phenomena appearing in more complex turbulent wall - bounded flows of great technological interest .",
    "the coordinates of the flow are : @xmath35 for the streamwise direction , @xmath36 for the cross - stream coordinate that separates the two plates , and @xmath9 for the spanwise direction .",

    "is decomposed in a mean @xmath42 and a fluctuating component @xmath43 .",
    "the mean turbulent velocity profile @xmath44 differs from the laminar one , @xmath45 , by a lower centerline velocity @xmath46 and increased near - wall velocity giving it a flatter shape . due to the increase in mean velocity near the wall ,",
    "the shear stress near the wall is higher for the turbulent case .",
    "the total shear stress @xmath2 appearing in the averaged reynolds equations gets contributions from both the viscous stress and the reynolds stress @xmath47 associated to the velocity fluctuations : @xmath48 @xmath49 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the symmetries of the domain and the reynolds equations imply that @xmath2 depends only on the cross - stream coordinate @xmath36 , and the dependence is linear , so that it can be written as @xmath50 the shear velocity @xmath51 gives the velocity scale of the turbulent velocity fluctuations .",
    "the formula @xcite : @xmath52 allows to compute @xmath53 from measurements of the mean velocity profile from the simulations .",
    "a length scale can be formed by combining @xmath53 with @xmath54 : the wall scale @xmath55 .",
    "the wall distance can now be expressed as @xmath56 , and the same normalization could be done for the rest of coordinates .",
    "the viscous reynolds number @xmath57 is simply the ratio between the two relevant length scales .",
    "the existence of coherent structures in turbulent wall - bounded flows has been known for several decades from investigations on intermittency in the interface between turbulent and potential flow regions , on the large eddy motions in the outer regions of the boundary layer , and on coherent features in the near - wall region ( @xcite and references therein ) . since then , through experimental and numerical investigations , a picture of the organization of these coherent structures in the turbulent boundary layer has emerged , which has become rather complete from the eulerian point of view @xcite .",
    "our approach is a contribution to the lagrangian exploration of these coherent structures , as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal velocity field in the inner region of the channel ( the viscous sublayer adjacent to the wall and the intermediate buffer region ) is organized into alternating streamwise streaks of high and low speed fluid .",
    "turbulence production occurs mainly in the buffer region in association with intermittent and violent outward ejections of low - speed fluid and inrushes of high - speed fluid towards the wall .",
    "the outer region is characterized by the existence of three - dimensional @xmath58-scale bulges that form on the turbulent / potential flows interface .",
    "irrotational valleys appear at the edges of the bulges , entraining high - speed fluid into the turbulent inner region .",
    "a central element in the structure of the turbulent boundary layer is the hairpin vortex , mainly because it is a structure with the capability of transporting mass and momentum across the mean velocity gradient and because it provides a paradigm with which to explain several observations of wall turbulence @xcite .",

    "a reason for this could be the fact that by setting the fsle final distance the length scales of turbulence retained in the fsle field is fixed , and then there will be only one time delay producing a peak in the correlation ( [ ruu ] ) , specifically that corresponding to @xmath153 .    ) and mean flow ( @xmath154 ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the profile of the propagation velocity is shown in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "the propagation velocity is very close to the mean flow velocity .",
    "the result shows that the maxima of the fsle field , that produce high values of @xmath149 and where we expect to find the ridges of the fsle field , move with the flow .",
    "hence , one may conclude , as expected , that the fsle ridges also move with the flow approximately as material surfaces .",
    "the previous description summarized the statistical properties of the different structures appearing in an instantaneous fsle field . to make further progress we now extract three - dimensional attracting lcss in a region of the channel at a series of time instants .",
    "the extraction domain had dimensions @xmath155 .",
    "the initial separation @xmath5 and distance ratio @xmath156 were increased from the previous calculation to improve the resolution and extract smoother structures , but sacrificing a complete view of 3d lcs in the turbulent channel .",
    "the extraction threshold was set to @xmath157 , a compromise value between speed and cost of extraction and continuity of the extracted surfaces .",
    "the fsle fields were calculated for an interval of @xmath158 time units with a time step of @xmath159 units .",
    "( @xmath129 ) .",
    "time goes from top to bottom , at intervals of 0.1 time units .",
    "the flow direction is in the positive @xmath35 direction in each panel , and a wall is at the bottom . the sequence shows how one of the flow structures is advected and passes through the @xmath128 plane . , scaledwidth=90.0%,height=755 ]    the 3d lcss are rendered in figure [ fig13 ] , in a sequence of time instants , as they pass through the calculation domain .",
    "they have a clearly 3d shape and move with the flow .",
    "the lcs seem to create a boundary between the inner turbulent region and the outer region that is practically devoid of fsle .",
    "the highest lcs have @xmath58-scale heights above the wall , and have a distinct mushroom shape enclosing the regions of the channel closer to the wall , where high fsle values can be found . near the wall ,",
    "the lcs adopt the shape of sheets parallel to it , which reflects the high rates of shear that occur in that region .",
    "these sheets form the base of the mushroom - shaped excursions up to the channel center .",
    "contrarily to the turbulent flow of the previous section , large scale oceanic flows , naturally turbulent , can be considered as almost 2d due to rotation and stratification effects .",
    "this fact makes the theory of 2d turbulence a very important tool to understand the ocean processes that occur at large scales .",
    "the main characteristic of 2d turbulence is the existence of an inverse energy cascade , from the small to the large scales and a direct enstrophy cascade .",
    "these cascades manifests themselves by the creation of large coherent vortices , and by the process of filamentation by which strain regions in the boundaries of the vortices produce lines of vorticity that are continuously stretched and deformed by the flow , concentrating the vorticity gradient in the small scales .",
    "this behavior is often observed in oceanic flows thereby confirming the importance of the 2d turbulent processes .",
    "the results presented in this section were obtained in the benguela ocean region , situated off the west coast of southern africa .",
    "it is characterized by a substantial mesoscale activity in the form of eddies and filaments , and also by the northward drift of agulhas eddies .",
    "the velocity data set comes from a regional ocean model ( roms ) simulation of the benguela region @xcite .",
    "additional details on this work can be found in @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional fsle fields were calculated for a @xmath160 day period starting september 17 of year 9 , with snapshots taken every @xmath161 days .",
    "the fields were calculated for an area of the benguela ocean region between latitudes 20s and 30s and longitudes 8e to 16e . the calculation domain extended vertically from @xmath101 up to @xmath162 m of depth .",
    "both backward and forward calculations were made in order to extract the attracting and repelling lcs .    in the left panel of figure [ fig14 ] a snapshot of the attracting lcss for day 1 of the calculation period",
    "the structures appear as thin vertical curtains , most of them extending throughout the whole depth of the calculation domain .",
    "the horizontal slices of the fsle field in figure [ fig14 ] ( left panel ) show that the attracting lcs fall on the maximum fsle field lines , as in the case of the turbulent channel flow ( figure [ fig13 ] ) .",
    "the fsle fields themselves exhibit a variation in intensity that decreases with depth , altough a local maximum is found at @xmath163 m ( not shown ) . the ridges also seem to be weaker as the depth increases since for the same strength threshold , the extracted portions of the ridges become less extent and eventually vanish .",
    "the atracting and repelling lcs ( figure [ fig14 ] , right panel ) populate the calculation region , testifying the enhanced mixing activity that is known to occur in that particular ocean region . the quite entangled `` web '' in which attracting and repelling lcss intersect mutually provides the skeleton for the barriers and pathways controlling transport @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    at this point , it may help to stress the differences between the eulerian and lagrangian detection of coherent structures .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig15 ] where the boundaries of a mesoscale eddy are shown using the q - criterion and the attracting and repelling lcs .",
    "the q - criterion @xcite uses the second invariant of @xmath164 : @xmath165 where @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , @xmath169 are the antisymmetric and symmetric components of @xmath164 , to identify regions where rotation dominates strain ( @xmath170 ) , commonly identified with coherent vortices , and strain dominated regions ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for reviews and criticism of several eulerian criteria .",
    "eulerian and lagrangian measures limit approximately the same region , but are substantially different .",
    "the q - criterion is related to the instantaneous configuration of the second invariant of @xmath164 and therefore conveys only local information about fluid flow processes .",
    "the lagrangian perspective , on the other hand , provides an integration of the temporal evolution of material properties of the flow , e.g. material transport , and thus should give more meaningful information about the processes that rely on ocean material transport .",
    "this issue can be further explored by looking at a filamentation event ( described more extensively in @xcite ) .",
    "a set of particles were released inside the eddy at day 1 at a depth of 50 m. at day 11 of the calculation period ( see figure [ fig15 ] ) , they have formed a filament that is expelled from the eddy , so that particles clearly cross the q - criterion isosurface .",
    "this shows that the eulerian criteria is inadequate as an indicator of regions of material transport in the flow . on the contrary",
    ", it can be observed that the lagrangian description of the eddy boundaries does bear relation with material transport into and out of the eddy , since the particle filament leaves the enclosed region that we associate with the mesoscale eddy by following one of the identified lagrangian boundaries .",
    "( red ) . the particles ( black dots ) were released inside the eddy at day 1 at a depth of 50 m and are leaving now the eddy as a filament along the upper part of the attracting lcs . ]",
    "lyapunov exponents are useful to identify lagrangian coherent structures in turbulent flows .",
    "these constitute the pattern determining the pathways of particle transport in the flow and thus strongly influence the transport and mixing properties in the fluid .    in this paper",
    "we have used a particular type of lyapunov exponents , the so - called finite - size lyapunov exponents , to identify lcs in 3d flows .",
    "the finite size lyapunov exponent was used to measure the rate of streching of initially nearby fluid particles in the flow domain and the lagrangian coherent structures where identified as the the ridges of the fsle field .",
    "these ridges were filtered in order to retain only the strongest attracting or repelling structures .    in a turbulent channel flow , the fsle field",
    "is organized into longitudinal structures close to the wall that develop into sloping ones away from the wall .",
    "correlations in the streamwise and spanwise direction show the typical dimensions of these structures .",
    "they were found to be similar to the eulerian coherent structures that are known to exist in this same regions of the turbulent channel .",
    "specially , elongated streamwise vortices that move low speed fluid away from the wall into the channel core . in 3d , the lcss appear as mushroom - shaped excursions of near - wall sheet - like structures of a scale comparable to the channel width .",
    "they separate the channel into an interior region , where the fsle attains high values , and an exterior region , showing low fsle values .",
    "the distribution of lcs in the turbulent channel resembles the commonly accepted picture where upward excursions of near wall fluid coexist with inward rushes of mid - channel irrotational flow .",
    "further work is necessary to elucidate the relations between lcs and fluid transport in these type of flows , not least because the visualization of 3d structures and transport in turbulence is a complex and time - consuming subject .    in a quasi-2d mesoscale oceanic flow ,",
    "the lcss appear as quasi - vertical surfaces highlighting the fact that dispersion in this case is mainly horizontal .",
    "the high mixing activity can be deduced from the proliferation of lcs in the flow domain and their mutual intersection .",
    "these lcs were seen to provide barriers and pathways to transport in the case of a mesoscale eddy , contrary to eulerian measures that failed to provide indicative locations or directions of major transport events .    the main difference between these two 3d turbulent flows with respect to the lcss seems to be the fact that in the case of oceanic flow , turbulence was limited to the horizontal plane wheras in the channel flow case , turbulent fluctuations in all three space directions had similar magnitude , thereby producing much more complex 3d shapes in this latter case .",
    "in the oceanic flow , vertical motions have a tendency to be supressed by the combined effects of the earth s rotation and the stratification of the ocean .",
    "this results in the aforementioned dominance of horizontal dispersion .",
    "the quasi - horizontal character of oceanic flows results in a phenomenology of turbulence similar to that of 2d turbulence rather than to 3d turbulence .",
    "we note that there are fundamental differences between the lagrangian and eulerian coherent structures , although they can actually have a common interpretation as vortices or shear layers .",
    "lagrangian coherent structures have a clear impact in particle trajectories whereas eulerian coherent structures are related to space / time coherency in , e.g. , velocity signals and do not necessarily affect particles . in the above comparison , only the strongest fsle features had a clear connection to the features in the eulerian distribution , which indicates that , inversely , only the eulerian features that live long enough or are strong enough to affect particles in a discernible fashion will appear in the lagrangian point of view of coherent structures .    the results shown in this paper highlight the usefulness of lyapunov analysis and dynamical systems theory as a tool to study transport and mixing in fluid flows , through the concept of lagrangian coherent structures .",
