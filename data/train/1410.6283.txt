    "variability with a few periods of the order of one day is frequently observed in main - sequence b - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "objects exhibiting only these slow oscillations are now called * s*lowly * p*ulsating * b*-type stars ( spb ) and are found in the spectral - type range of b3-b8 .",
    "it is commonly believed that this variability is due to excitation of high - order g - modes .",
    "such modes are also invoked as an explanation of low - frequency variations observed in certain @xmath7 cephei stars .",
    "linear non - adiabatic calculations predict excitation of high - order g - modes in a wide range of main sequence b - type stars .",
    "however , difficulties in explaining in this way long - period variability in certain objects have been noted .    in several stars , observations from space by the corot and _",
    "kepler _ missions led to the detection of a large number of frequency peaks which may be associated with g - modes .",
    "however , mode identification for individual peaks seems a formidable task . a method based on a search for equidistant spacing in period , that has been successfully used in the application to white dwarfs , was tried for the corot target hd50230 by @xcite .",
    "the authors found a sequence of eight modes with a remarkably constant separation , much more so than in relevant models @xcite . in the same frequency range",
    "there were over 100 frequencies ( some of much higher s / n than most of those forming the sequence ) for which no plausible interpretation was offered so far @xcite . in an attempt to explain",
    "the oscillation spectrum of another corot target , hd 43317 , @xcite also could not account for the equidistant spacing reported by @xcite .",
    "patterns in oscillation spectra apparently do not yield a key toward deciphering information on excited modes in spb stars .",
    "we need to know more about mode selection in these stars .",
    "perhaps we may learn something new about it from ground - based observations , which yield much fewer frequency peaks than the ones from space , but much more information about each of them that would enable mode identification . in this respect ,",
    "the spb star @xmath0 eri appears to be the best choice .",
    "a large number of three - passband photometric data for this star have been collected during two multisite campaigns ( msc ) aimed at the @xmath7 cep variable @xmath8 eri , 2002 - 2003 msc @xcite and 2003 - 2004 msc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter j2005 ) .",
    "the star has been used as one of two comparison stars in both campaigns .",
    "the analysis of the 2002 - 2003 msc data by @xcite revealed a variability of @xmath0 eri with a frequency of 0.616 c / d .",
    "however , the authors were not able to decide what is the origin of this variation : pulsation or rotational modulation .",
    "the analysis of the extensive data set from both campaigns presented in j2005 led to the detection of five additional significant peaks in the g - mode frequency range typical for spb stars and an unambiguous classification of @xmath0 eri .",
    "additional three - colour data were recently obtained by one of us ( gh ) . these and the msc data were employed in the mode identification presented in our work .",
    "photometry with the most micro - satellite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter j2013 ) was also used in frequency determination in section2.3 .",
    "unfortunately , spectroscopic observations reported in the same paper yielded only the upper bound on radial velocity variations .",
    "however , these observations were used to constrain parameters of the star ; this , as we will see later in the paper , is essential for mode identification .",
    "all data used in our work are presented in the next section .",
    "we also provide information on the mean physical parameters of the star and describe its models which will be used in the subsequent sections .    in section3 , we confront frequencies of the peaks with instability ranges determined in one of the selected models .",
    "we use the condition of mode instability as a requirement for its possible association with an observed frequency .",
    "mode visibility is another factor limiting the set of modes for possible identification .",
    "this matter is discussed in section4 .",
    "section5 is devoted to an analysis of the data on the amplitudes and phases of the six peaks determined in three photometric passbands .",
    "the aim is to determine the harmonic degree , @xmath9 , and the azimuthal order , @xmath10 , of the observed modes simultaneously with constraints on the stellar rotation rate , assuming that it is uniform .",
    "the method , which employs the traditional approximation , has been described in detail by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter d07a ) and here we give only its brief outline .    we have not attempted to constrain a stellar model by fitting calculated frequencies to observations because it would not make sense in view of the approximation adopted in treating the effects of rotation and high density of the calculated oscillation spectra related to high radial orders of the excited modes .",
    "our primary goal is to learn something about mode selection in spb stars .",
    "we believe that this is essential for understanding complicated oscillation spectra from the space missions .",
    "the discussion in the final section is focused on this issue .",
    "@xmath0 eridani ( hd 30211 ) is a bright ( @xmath124 mag ) b5 iv star .",
    "it is certainly not a slow rotator .",
    "j2013 provide two independent estimates of the projected equatorial velocity of rotation , @xmath13130@xmath143 and 136@xmath146 km / s .",
    "it has been known since a long time @xcite that the star is the primary in a single - lined spectroscopic binary system but only j2005 detected shallow eclipses .",
    "this is a well detached system with the orbital period @xmath157.38090 d and eccentricity @xmath160.344 ( j2013 ) .",
    "hence , we can neither assume synchronized rotation nor parallel rotation and orbital axes .",
    "thus , mode identification must be done simultaneously with the determination of the inclination angle .",
    "we adopted after j2013 @xmath174.195@xmath140.013 and @xmath183.280@xmath140.040 for the effective temperature and luminosity of @xmath0 eri .",
    "these values were found from the mean strmgren photometric indexes and the revised value of the _ hipparcos _ parallax @xcite . from their own spectroscopic data , j2013 found a metal abundance close to solar .",
    "they also determined the mean density of the star , @xmath190.0348@xmath140.0032 g/@xmath20 from the orbital parameters .",
    "the above - mentioned values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 imply a mass @xmath246.0 m@xmath25 and a radius @xmath266.1 r@xmath25 , hence the break - up velocity amounts to @xmath27 430 km / s and the corresponding value of the critical rotational frequency to @xmath281.3 c / d .",
    "thus , @xmath0 eri rotates at a speed of at least 30% of @xmath29 .",
    "our models are spherically symmetric and include only the spherically symmetric effect of centrifugal force .",
    "this is a crude but an acceptable approximation if @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the angular frequency of rotation and its critical value , respectively .",
    "assuming for @xmath0 eri the radius of @xmath33 , we obtain @xmath34 for @xmath35 km / s and this number is the upper limit in our search for the mode identification .",
    "the adopted lower limit is 130 km / s and it results from the value of @xmath36 km / s . in all our models",
    ", rotation is assumed uniform .",
    "all the stellar models in this work were calculated with the warsaw evolution code adopting opal opacities @xcite for @xmath37 = 0.28 , @xmath38=0.015 and the agss09 solar mixture of heavy elements @xcite .",
    "parameters of the models adopted for mode identification in @xmath0 eri are listed in table1 . as may be seen in fig.1 , where positions of the models on the evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram are shown ,",
    "these models satisfy the observational constraints discussed above . at a finite rotation rate ,",
    "positions in the hr diagram depend on @xmath4 .",
    "what is shown are aspect - averaged positions but the spread is small in comparison with the mean shift which we may asses by comparing tracks with the initial equatorial velocity of 200 and 0 km / s .",
    "the three selected models were calculated adopting @xmath39200 km / s at the zams and the overshooting parameter , @xmath400.2 .",
    "note in fig.1 that the track with @xmath400 enters the error box but only at the edge of the strip allowed by the mean density .",
    "model 2 is on the same track as model1 but it is more evolved .",
    "model 3 has a similar temperature to model 2 but has seven percent higher surface gravity and is less evolved .",
    "all these models lie within the main sequence , close to its red boundary ( tams ) .",
    ".models considered for @xmath0 eridani . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the modes we associated with @xmath41 are , in fact , unstable but for the tidal excitation this is irrelevant . what matters is only that the driving or damping rate is much lower than the frequency . however , it is important to stress that we end up with the same identification of the @xmath41 peak considering only unstable modes .",
    "none of the @xmath42 values listed in tables3 - 5 comes close to 0.01 , which was set as the upper limit for acceptable identifications .",
    "we can not exclude very different identifications if the equatorial velocity is above 280 km / s , which we adopted as the maximum only because of limitations of the method we used .",
    "it is fortunate that consistent identifications were found well below this value . with @xmath43 km / s ,",
    "the star rotates at less than 1/3 of the maximum rotation rate and the excess of the equatorial radius over the mean radius is below 4 percent .",
    "the stabilization of retrograde modes was found by @xcite much closer to maximum equatorial velocity .",
    "thus , there should be no reservation against our few identification with such modes .",
    "using three - band photometric data , we determined angular numbers , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , of modes responsible for the six significant frequency peaks in the fast rotating spb star @xmath0 eri . simultaneously , narrow ranges for the allowed equatorial velocity of rotation were found .",
    "we took into account modes with @xmath44 in three models with mean parameters strongly constrained by observational data .",
    "the modes were calculated with a nonadiabatic version of _ the traditional approximation_. for the five frequency peaks only unstable modes were taken into account whereas for the one frequency @xmath45 this condition was relaxed . nevertheless , the identified modes for this frequency turned out to be unstable .",
    "thus , we can not decide whether the @xmath41 peak arises from the tidal action exerted by the companion or from excitation by the @xmath46-mechanism operating in the @xmath38-bump zone .",
    "fortunately , this uncertainty neither affects constraints on the rotation rate nor the mode identification .",
    "the inferred equatorial velocity is slightly different for the three models but for all of them it is between 135 and 140 km / s .",
    "one interesting difference between the models was found for the dominant peak , which was attributed to a zonal @xmath473 mode in two models ( models1 and 3 ) and to a prograde @xmath471 mode in one ( model2 ) .",
    "these different identifications were found with models1 and 2 lying on the same @xmath48m@xmath25 evolutionary track and differing by less than 0.008 in @xmath21 . with model3 ( @xmath495.85  m@xmath25 , @xmath21 nearly the same as model2 )",
    "all angular numbers were found to be the same as in model1 , except for one alternative identification for @xmath41 . with all our models , only the @xmath474 and @xmath500 numbers and only at the lowest equatorial velocity allowed by @xmath51 data were found acceptable for the second in the significance hierarchy peak ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this eliminated the @xmath471 and @xmath500 possibility for the dominant peak which otherwise would have been acceptable in the wide range of @xmath3 for all three models .    with known @xmath3 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , we calculated amplitudes of the radial velocity variations and compared them with spectroscopic data , which yielded only an upper bound .",
    "the @xmath473 , @xmath500 identification for @xmath53 leads to the amplitude exceeding the upper bound by at least a factor of three . with @xmath471 , @xmath501 ,",
    "the excess is much lower .",
    "it would be going too far to judge that model2 is better than the remaining two models because the spectroscopic and photometric data do not satisfy criteria of a reliable comparison , as specified in section5.3 .",
    "nonetheless , the large difference in the calculated amplitudes points to the prospect for constraining model parameters with better data on the radial velocity amplitudes .",
    "there are some differences in @xmath9 inferred with model2 and with the remaining two models . for the @xmath41 peak",
    ", @xmath500 is found with all models but @xmath474 is inferred with models1 and 3 while @xmath476 with model2 . for the @xmath52 peak the @xmath474 , @xmath500 identification is found with all the models whereas for the @xmath54 peak we got @xmath474 , @xmath551 .",
    "for the lowest amplitude peaks there are alternative identifications .",
    "the inferred degrees range from @xmath471 to 6 .",
    "it seems that there is no way to predict which of the huge number of unstable modes will reach the amplitude at a specified detection level . neither driving rate nor visibility is a reliable predictor .",
    "perhaps the preference to the @xmath474 modes results from a compromise between visibility and the number of unstable modes in the frequency range of the peaks .",
    "this number is much higher at @xmath474 than 1 .",
    "pulsations in spb stars appear less predictable than the stochastic solar - like oscillations .    without constraints on the angular numbers from multiband photometry",
    "the task of mode identification in spb stars appears totally hopeless . in section1",
    ", we stressed that an equidistant separations in period found by corot are most likely misleading .",
    "the @xmath56 limit on the potential identifications is not justified . in the present work",
    ", we considered modes up to @xmath476 but it may still be not enough .",
    "the degree of excited modes even at the moderate rotation rates may only be determined jointly with azimuthal orders and the inclination of the rotation axis .",
    "this complicates the mode identification but as a reward we obtain valuable information about rotation .",
    "the result is sensitive to model parameters .",
    "adequate data on the radial velocity amplitude lead to a new constraint on the model .",
    "unfortunately , for @xmath0 eri we have only upper limits .",
    "this is one of the sources of uncertainties of our results .",
    "data on radial velocity amplitudes are very important but to be fully useful they have to come from an epoch not too distant from that of the photometric data and must be based on measurements of changes in the first moments of spectral lines which measure disc - averaged velocities .",
    "we are indebted to the anonymous referee for pointing out that the frequency @xmath41 is a whole multiple of the orbital frequency .",
