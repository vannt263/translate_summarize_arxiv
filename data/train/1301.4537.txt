    "the decoherence of quantum states by the environment is the main obstacle in the way towards realizing quantum computers . to circumvent this difficulty some interesting topological quantum computation schemes @xcite have been suggested , where quantum information is stored in nonlocal ( topological ) degrees of freedom of topologically ordered systems .",
    "these nonlocal degrees of freedom are decoupled from local perturbations , enabling the topological approach to quantum information processing to obtain its exceptional fault tolerance and to have a tremendous advantage over conventional ones .",
    "the simplest non - abelian excitation for topological qubits is the zero energy majorana bound state ( mbs ) @xcite , which is predicted to be exist in the spin lattice systems @xcite , in the @xmath0 superconductors @xcite , in the filling fraction @xmath1 fractional quantum hall system @xcite , in the superconductor sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 @xcite , in the topological insulators @xcite , and in some semiconductors with strong spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "however , the local decoupling makes measuring and manipulating topological states difficult because they can only be manipulated by globe braiding operations , i.e. , by physical exchange of the associated local quasiparticle non - abelian excitations @xcite .",
    "moreover topologically protected braiding operations for ising anyons alone are not adequate to fulfill universal quantum computation and have to be supplemented with topologically unprotected operations @xcite . within a topological system unprotected operations",
    "prove to be very challenging because of significant nonuniversal effects @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "conventional quantum information processing systems have been advancing steadily , such as the recent progresses in quantum network using single atoms in optical cavities @xcite , in long coherence times of nuclear spins in a diamond crystal @xcite , in high fidelity manipulations on trapped ions @xcite and on superconducting qubits @xcite , in generation of entanglement between single - atoms at a distance @xcite and between a photon and a solid - state spin qubit @xcite    thus it is highly desirable to combine the advantages of conventional qubits with those of topological qubits to construct hybrid systems , where the necessary topologically unprotected gates can be imported from the conventional quantum systems ( cqs ) and topological states can be transferred to cqs for high fidelity readout .",
    "such hybrid systems have been considered recently for the anyons in optical lattices @xcite and for the majorana anyons coupled to superconducting flux qubits @xcite or to a semiconductor double - dot qubit @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a scheme for quantum information transfer between a superconducting flux qubit @xcite and a topological qubit encoded on majorana fermions ( mfs ) at the junctions among three superconductors mediated by a topological insulator ( ti ) @xcite .",
    "the strong jaynes - cummings ( jc ) coupling between topological and superconducting flux qubits can be obtained on the basis of the interaction between two mfs located at the two ends of a linear superconductor - ti - superconductor ( stis ) junction , and be coherently controlled by the phase differences between the two superconductors of the stis junction . with this strong coupling at hand , arbitrary",
