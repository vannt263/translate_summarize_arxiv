    "we assume white noise disorder for the exciton field of amplitude @xmath176  mev and a gaussian - correlated disorder for the photon field , with amplitude @xmath177  mev and a correlation length of @xmath178 m .",

    "[ fig : allg2 ] ( d - i ) : the profile of the coherent photon field @xmath179 in the three cases is shown in panels ( g - i ) and the corresponding spatio - temporal patterns of correlations are shown in panel ( d - f ) .",
    "the realization of the disorder potential is the same for the three values of the pump intensity .",
    "even if it is responsible for large density modulations , the considered disorder is never able to destroy the near - field correlation pattern .",
    "of course the pattern would eventually disappear if a much stronger disorder was considered , that is able to fragment the coherent field in disconnected parts .",
    "however , this latter situation is quite unusual for state - of - the - art gaas microcavities .    from the comparison with the corresponding correlation patterns for a clean system [ fig .",
    "[ fig : allg2 ] ( a - c ) ] , we can still appreciate a slight modification in the pattern .",
    "disorder is responsible for these modifications via three main effects : i ) the exciton and photon resonances are broadened ; ii ) @xmath180-conservation is broken , which softens the condition for parametric processes ; iii ) the group velocity is no longer a well defined concept , so the contour of the butterfly shape in fig .",

    "we have developed a formalism to compute the second order spatial correlation function of polaritons in a planar microcavity .",
    "this quantity directly transfer into the near - field intensity correlations of the emitted light .",
    "we have computed the spatio - temporal pattern of correlations in different pumping regimes , ranging from the parametric luminescence regime , to the critical region just below the parametric oscillation threshold , and to the strong pumping regime where a large blue - shift of the polariton modes is able to prevent parametric oscillation .    for each regime , we have identified the key features of the correlation pattern . in the uniform case ,",
    "we have compared our results to the predictions of approximate analytic models which provide a physical interpretation to the observed patterns .",
    "an orthogonal pump geometry appears as the optimal choice for the experimental observation as it reduces the required temporal resolution of photo - detectors .",
    "we have verified that the correlation patterns are not qualitatively modified by a realistic disorder as long as the coherent polaritons remain delocalized in space .",
    "the conclusions of the present work confirm the expectation that intensity correlations can be a very powerful tool to study the dynamics of quantum fields in condensed matter systems .",

    "in this appendix , we discuss the connection between the photon field inside the cavity and the emitted light .",
    "in particular , we show that the calculated in - cavity intensity correlations directly transfer to the near - field correlations of the emitted light .",
    "we consider a planar cavity along the @xmath181 plane with a quantum well placed at @xmath182 and mirrors whose external surface is at @xmath183 . in fourier space , the external field @xmath184 , resulting from the transmission across the mirror",

    "@xmath192 , the phase of the transmission coefficient can be accurately approximated by the expansion @xmath193 with @xmath194 and @xmath195    the transmitted field thus reduces to @xmath196 where we have used the relation ( valid in the air ) @xmath197 and we have included the transmittivity @xmath189 and a global phase into the multiplicative constant @xmath198 .    without the mirror , the field @xmath199 would be given by @xmath200 comparison between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eout_bis ] ) and ( [ eq : e_nomirror ] ) shows that the only effect of the mirror on the external field is to give a time shift of @xmath201 and a longitudinal space shift @xmath202 .",
    "we now demonstrate that the expansion ( [ eq : phaset ] ) holds for a typical high - quality gaas microcavity with @xmath203 dbr s mirrors @xcite . to this purpose ,",
    "we employ the standard transfer matrix approach @xcite to compute the @xmath180- and @xmath188-dependent complex transmission coefficient @xmath204 across the top mirror placed between the cavity and the air .",
    "we consider the typical case where the dbr s mirrors are composed by two alternate dielectric layers with index of refraction @xmath205 and @xmath206 and length @xmath207 and @xmath208 , respectively , such as @xmath209 , @xmath210 being the cavity wavelength .",

    "this result originates from the fact that within the stop band the transfer matrix @xmath236 ( and consequently @xmath237 ) has real eigenvalues , and thus does not induce any extensive phase shift .    the results of this appendix show that the only effect of the mirror on the near - field correlation pattern is the following : the light detected outside of the cavity appears to be generated at a slightly earlier time and at a slightly displaced longitudinal position as compared to the quantum well position .",
    "in the experiments one has therefore simply to focus the optical detection on this shifted position ."
