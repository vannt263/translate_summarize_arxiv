    "string theory suggests that the spacetime we live in might be higher dimensional and theories with extra dimensions have received much attention in high energy physics , especially in the context of hierarchy problems and cosmology @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", it is very likely that our four - dimensional universe is a hypersurface called brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime called a bulk . according to this brane world scenario , gravity and other exotic matter",
    "can propagate in the bulk , while all matter and gauge interactions are confined on the brane . on the other hand ,",
    "one of the most important questions in particle physics today is how to explain the huge discrepancy between the gravity scale @xmath5 and the electro - weak scale @xmath6 .",
    "the first braneworld scenario addressing the problem of the mass hierarchy is the arkani - hamed - dimopoulos - dvali ( add ) model with @xmath7 flat compactified large extra dimensions of size @xmath8 @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed planck scale is the product of the fundamental planck scale of the full volume of the bulk and the volume of the extra dimensions @xmath9 therefore , in the add model the fundamental planck scale could be much smaller than the planck scale and could be comparable to the electroweak scale if more than one extra dimension are used .",
    "major progress has been made by randall and sundrum ( rs ) who considered a warped 5-dimensional bulk geometry compactified on a @xmath10 manifold , and provide an alternative approach to explain the huge discrepancy between the electroweak scale and the planck scale @xcite .",
    "the geometry is that of a 5-dimensional anti - de - sitter space ( @xmath11 ) , which is a space of constant negative curvature .",
    "there are two rs scenarios : in the rsi scenario , the geometry contains two 4-d flat branes localized at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the planck brane ( hidden ) with positive tension where gravity is localized , and the tev brane ( visible ) with negative tension where all standard model fields are confined , that bound an extra dimension which is compactified to @xmath10 orbifold . in this scenario",
    ", the 5-d gravity is sourced by the two 4-d flat branes with opposite tensions and a finely tuned non - vanishing 5d cosmological constant . since the two branes are completely flat , the induced metric at every point along the extra dimension has to be the ordinary flat 4-d minkowski metric , and the components of the 5-d metric depend only on the fifth coordinate .",
    "thus , the most general spacetime metric satisfying these properties is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the physical distance along the extra dimension .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is the warp factor which measures the degree of curvature along the extra dimension .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 , which governs the degree of curvature of the @xmath11 space , is assumed to be of the order of the planck scale .",
    "considering the fluctuations of the metric @xmath18 , one obtains the expression for the effective 4-d gravity scale as a function of the rs parameters @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fundamental 5-d gravity scale .    in the second randall - sundrum model ( rsii )",
    ", the bulk is infinite and there is only one brane with positive tension located at @xmath12 . in this scenario",
    "there is no mechanism to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "the spectrum of rsii is continuous and consist of all @xmath21 kk modes , and there are no @xmath22(tev ) signatures for this model at the colliders .",
    "the infinite extra dimension makes a finite contribution to the 5-d volume because of the warp factor , and the effective size of the extra dimension is @xmath23 .    on the other hand",
    ", it is established that string theory induced noncommutative ( nc ) geometry @xcite provides an effective minimal length theory to study short distance physics .",
    "also one of the most interesting consequences of all promising quantum gravity candidates is the existence of a minimal observable length on the order of the planck length .",
    "the idea of a minimal length can be modeled in terms of a quantized spacetime and goes back to the early days of quantum field theory @xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "however , in a scenario with extra dimensions , it is expected that the effects of the string inspired nc scale become important at the same energy scale at which the effective extra dimensional models predict new physics .",
    "thus , the nc minimal length should be lowered down to tev energies @xcite .",
    "a powerful tool to probe the existence and physical implication of extra dimensions , by studying the quantum fluctuations of vacuum in higher dimensional spacetime , is the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the later is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory in confined geometries and depends crucially on the dimensionality and topology of the spacetime . actually the precision of the measurement of the casimir effect has been greatly improved @xcite , making the casimir effect to be remarkably observable and a trustworthy manifestation of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the casimir effect as the physical manifestation of zero - point energy has received great attention , and has been extensively studied .",
    "the effect has been investigated in the context of string theory @xcite , and with its relation in stabilizing the radion in the randall - sundrum model @xcite .",
    "the casimir effect for parallel plates geometry has been also studied for a scalar field in spacetime with compactified universal extra dimensions @xcite and for massless bulk field in the randall - sundrum models @xcite , and for massive and massless scalar field in a randall - sundrum type braneworld consisting of a single brane extended by one compact extra dimension @xcite .",
    "recently , the standard casimir effect in the presence of a minimal length , arising from nc spacetimes and generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) , has been also considered @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the possible effects that a nc scale length might have on the casimir force for massless bulk scalar fields confined between two parallel plates in the 5-dimensional rs brane worlds . in our setup , in order to maintain lorentz invariance , the noncommutativity between coordinates is only implemented on the brane . for simplicity , we adopt the scalar field - photon analogy to calculate the casimir force due to the electromagnetic field @xcite . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief review of the realization of spacetime noncommutativity in the rs models . in section iii , we calculate explicitly to leading order , in the case where the interbrane distance is larger than the nc scale length , the renormalized casimir energy and force acting on the plates . in section iv , we perform a numerical analysis of our analytical expressions , and discuss the consequences of the presence of the nc cutoff on the nature of the casimir force . our concluding remarks and summarized in section 5 .",
    "it is a common lore that any consistent formulation of quantum gravity leads to the appearance of a minimal length of the order of the planck length .",
    "a particular implementation of such a minimal length can be realized in the so called nc field theory on spacetimes where the coordinates satisfy the following structure relations @xmath24=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu},\\label{structure}\\ ] ] and where @xmath25 is an antisymmetric lorentz tensor .",
    "an immediate consequence of these relations is the following generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) and minimal length @xmath26 these relations go back to the early days of quantum field theory and appeared for the first time in the pioneering work of snyder @xcite .",
    "these are also the structure relations satisfied , in the context of string theory , by the endpoints of open strings in non trivial rr flux backgrounds @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we implement the spacetime noncommutativity on the brane in the rs scenario using the method based on the coherent states representation @xcite .",

    "the factor @xmath66 accounts for the possible polarizations of the photon . in our case @xmath79 in 4-d spacetime , and we have taken into account the overall factor of 2 for the volume of the orbifold , which cancel the usual @xmath80 factor .",

    ". finally , analyzing the variation of the casimir force as a function of the interbrane distance @xmath187 for fixed plate separation and different values of the nc cutoff , we found that @xmath187 @xmath201 and @xmath2 for @xmath3 gev and @xmath4 gev , respectively , confirming the previous finding of @xcite .",
    "we also performed the calculation of the casimir force in the nc rsii brane model , in which the 3-brane at the boundary @xmath141 is at infinity .",
    "we obtained an analytical expression for the casimir force between the plates , which shows that the force contains a repulsive nc contribution but remains attractive , and that the deviation from the experimentally measured force is too small to be significant .",
    "this supports previous findings that rsii brane scenario has no low energy measurable consequences .",
