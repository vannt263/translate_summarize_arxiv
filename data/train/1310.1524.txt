    "background independence is often ( but not always ) considered in attempts to combine general relativity ( gr ) and quantum theory .",
    "standard quantum theory is _ not _ background - independent because it clings to either newton s absolute structures ( absolute time in particular ) or to the distinct absolute structures @xcite that special relativity replaced these with .",
    "i.e. minkowski spacetime as a fixed background with its other type of privileged inertial frames and its timelike killing vector . on the other hand , gr is not only a relativistic theory of gravitation but also einstein s attempt to free physics from background structures . here",
    "frames are only local and are determined by matter content , time is but a coordinate choice , and the generic gr spacetime has no killing vectors of any kind .",
    "einstein s attempt did not directly address @xcite further relational machian issues concerning time and space .",
    "however , it has since been determined that the theory of gr he arrived at in fact already manages @xcite to incorporate these . to proceed with explaining this , firstly the more standard and traditional dynamical / canonical formulation of gr  wheeler s",
    "geometrodynamics @xcite  is required . here",
    "gr is reformulated as a dynamics of evolving spatial 3-geometries which stack together to form the standard formulation s spacetime .",
    "this is usually described by evolving spatial 3-metrics which , unlike the description in terms of 3-geometries , have 3-coordinate ( or , better , 3-diffeomorphism ) redundancy but also the benefit of explicit computibility . secondly , if one starts out from leibniz ",
    "mach relational first principles about time and space , one arrives at an equivalent variant of the geometrodynamics formulation of gr .",
    "( a similar analysis also applies @xcite if one considers instead ashtekar variables - type dynamical formulations of gr @xcite that have dominated the canonical , but not dynamical , gr literature since the late 1980 s . )",
    "background independence notions are often held to carry substantial physical , philosophical and conceptual content @xcite .",
    "this is for reasons that go back to the centuries - old absolute versus relative ( relational ) motion debate @xcite .",
    "it should be said that the background independence attempted  from einstein to a ) ashtekar variables programs such as loop quantum gravity @xcite and b ) the present paper  is at the _ metric level _ @xcite .",
    "this is as opposed to topological - level background independence , for which humankind largely remains physically and mathematically unprepared to this day ( see the conclusion ) .",
    "background independence is also a stated goal in m - theory @xcite , and furnishes one approach to supergravity ( particularly in canonical form ) @xcite .",
    "the above examples gives some idea of the opening sentence s ` often ' . on the other hand",
    ", its ` not always ' is exemplified by covariant perturbative quantization of gr and of alternative theories ( including perturbative string theory ) , and by further theories mentioned in the conclusion .",
    "some precursors for the current paper s material and presentation are as follows .",
    "most of it arose from analysing which facets of and isham s problem_s _ of time @xcite in quantum gravity already occur at the classical level @xcite .",
    "this was found to recover @xcite many of the postulates , implementations , results and insights of barbour - type relationalism @xcite .",
    "this theory of background independence can also be seen as an extension  from two postulates with implementations to _ nine _  of a variant of barbour s relationalism : an extension that goes as far as covering all of the quantum aspects of the problem of time .",
    "i accredit gryb @xcite for previously considered a theory of background independence based just on ( a different variant of ) barbour s two relational postulates and implementations , with links to a small fraction of problem of time facets mentioned .",
    "however , the present work exceeds that by nine to two and by having comprehensive links to all of the known quantum and classically problem of time facets . moreover , barbour s relationalism s two postulates proved to be highly unselective among the well - known alternative theories to gr @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the conclusion gives a number of examples of how the present paper s nine are substantially more selective in this manner .",
    "thus this paper provides a coherent enlargement of barbour s work into a theory of background independence that 1 ) is both usefully restrictive of widely proposed fundamental theories of physics .",
    "2 ) it exposits the problem of time as a _ consequence _ of the physically , philosophically and conceptually desirable option of directly implementing ( metric ) background independence .",
    "note that 8/9ths of the possible alternative conceptual facets of the quantum problem of time already possess classical precursors @xcite .",
    "thus we start with the classical version .",
    "the outline of the current paper is as follows . after the structural considerations and toy models outlined in sec 2 , i cover temporal relationalism in sec 3 and configurational relationalism in sec 4 .",
    "these are the barbour - type postulates and implementations .",
    "i then cover constraint closure in sec 5 , expression in terms of beables in sec 6 , gr - type spacetime relationalism in sec 7 , foliation independence as attained by refoliation invariance in sec 8 , spacetime reconstruction in sec 9 .",
    "these are the 7/9ths of the aspects of background independence that bring about 7/9ths of the facets of the problem of time [ labelled exclusively by 1 ) to 9 ) in this article ] that are to be faced by _ a local _ resolution of the problem of time @xcite .",
    "the remaining ninths are globally defined specifications ( which lead to the global problem of time ) and uniqueness specifications ( which lead to the multiple choice problem of time ) .",
    "these are much less well understood in detail , as regards 1 ) the extent of the list of global sub - aspects of background independence ( and of consequent global problem of time ) .",
    "2 ) also as regards addressing uniqueness specifications ( and of the consequent multiple choice problem ) in a manner that is both mathematically sharp and applies to a wide range of models / theories .",
    "so whilst i do give a conceptual outline of these in secs 11 and 12 , they largely remain among the frontiers of knowledge ( see the conclusion ) .",
    "sec 10 concerns the classical paths and histories counterparts of constraint closure and beables .",
    "sec 12 also summarizes the connection between this paper s background independence postulates and problem of time facets .",
    "these are labelled both with the names and conceptualizations used by kucha and isham @xcite and under my updated names for these @xcite .",
    "refer to appendix a for a mosaic of figurelets that support the main text .",
    "i adopt the position that dynamics is primary ( as opposed to e.g. spacetime being primary ) .",
    "i start with the notion of configuration @xmath0 for @xmath1 some indexing set .",
    "i.e. the generalization of the ` position ' half of ` positions and momenta ' in the case of basic point - particle mechanics .",
    "configuration space @xmath2 is then the space of all possible values of the configurations that a system can possess .",
    "one is then to build composite objects out of the configurations .",
    "these include the _ changes _ of configuration @xmath3 , actions , and the momenta @xmath4 that correspond to the @xmath5 .",
    "some simple examples of configuration spaces are as follows ; these also serve to introduce the toy models employed in the current paper .",
    "example 1 ) for the mechanics of @xmath6 particles in dimension @xmath7 in flat space the simplest ( and redundant ) configuration space is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this is the space of possible values of the particle positions @xmath9 .",
    "[ underline denotes @xmath7-dimensional vector and @xmath10 a particle label running from 1 to @xmath6 . ]",
    "example 2 ) background - independent formulation of mechanics  * relational particle mechanics ( rpm ) * @xcite comes in scaled and pure - shape versions @xcite .",
    "these already possess 5/9 of the aspects of background independence at the classical level and 6/8 at the quantum level @xcite , rendering them useful model arenas for quite a few problem of time investigations .",
    "the configuration space for this example is @xmath11 for the scaled rpm of @xmath6 particles with the redundant translations with respect to an absolute origin trivially taken out by splitting out and discarding the centre of mass motion .",
    "this is the space of possible values of a basis of relative interparticle ( cluster ) separations , most conveniently jacobi s , @xmath12 , for label @xmath13 running from 1 to @xmath14 . in 1-@xmath7",
    "the scaled rpm has no other redundancies , so this manages to be a relational model with very simple and well - known configuration space mathematics .",

    "each of the above two examples have an obvious euclidean metric on configuration space ( the @xmath16 one rather than the spatial @xmath17 one etc ) .",
    "example 3 ) for full gr , a redundant configuration space is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "i.e. the space of all positive - definite 3-metrics @xmath19 on the fixed topological manifold @xmath20 .",
    "the latter is taken here for simplicity to be compact without boundary , and which is interpreted as the theory s notion of space .",
    "[ @xmath21 are the spatial coordinates and @xmath22 are spatial indices running from 1 to 3 . ]",

    "i.e. the gr configuration space metric alias inverse dewitt supermetric , @xmath24 .",
    "example 4 ) a simpler subcase of example 3 ) is * minisuperspace * ( @xmath20 ) @xcite : the space of homogeneous positive - definite 3-metrics on @xmath20 .",

    "minisuperspace @xcite has 7/9ths of the aspects of background independence classically and 8/9ths quantum mechanically , though quite a few of these imply _ very quickly resolved _ problem of time facets by virtue of homogeneity . while the rpm and minisuperspace cases are simple to manipulate , they miss the subtleties specifically associated with diffeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "example 5 ) a first model in which these appear nontrivially is * halliwell  hawking s model * of inhomogeneous perturbations about spatially-@xmath26 minisuperspace .",
    "this models a quantum - cosmological origin for the cmb hot - spots and galaxies .",
    "rpm s and minisuperspace complementarily support by one or the other having all _ other _ background independence / problem of time aspects of this last model .",
    "here one considers the first few ( usually two ) orders of the perturbation of the metric .",

    "my argument is this way round  using and being named for the dual geometrical property  on the grounds that it is a conceptual advance for background - independent physics to not name one s entities or techniques after physically - irrelevant properties .",
    "ii ) additionally , such actions are not to contain any extraneous time such as newton s absolute time . nor are they to contain any extraneous time - like variables such as the adm lapse of gr ( named after the notion of ` time elapsed ' ) .    the euler ",

    "example 1 ) jacobi s action principle @xcite for spatially - absolute mechanics .",
    "example 2 ) another case of jacobi s action principle occurs for scaled 1-d rpm with translations trivially removed @xcite .",
    "example 3 ) misner s principle @xcite for minisuperspace gr .",
    "all three of these actions principles are geometrical _ geodesic principles _ with respect to the physical line element @xmath27 .",
    "alternatively , they are _ parageodesic _ ( conformal to geodesic ) principles with respect to the configuration space line element .",
    "these two alternatives can be summarized for all three examples at once as follows : s = : = s .",
    "[ pi - geom - gestalt ] here @xmath28 is the geometrical ` kinetic arc element ' built out of the configuration space metric @xmath29 .",
    "also @xmath30 is the ` potential factor ' .",
    "this takes the form @xmath31 for spatially - absolute mechanics , @xmath32 for 1-@xmath7 scaled rpm or @xmath33 for minisuperspace ( and , in sec 4 , generic , gr ) .",
    "@xmath34 is total energy and @xmath35 is potential energy .",
    "@xmath36  generically of the form @xmath37 $ ]  is the ricci scalar corresponding to @xmath38 [ though for minisuperspace it is just for function dependence , @xmath39 $ ] for functional dependence and @xmath40 $ ] for mixed function ( before the ;) and functional ( after the ;) dependence .",

    "@xmath42 ) ] and @xmath43 is the cosmological constant .",
    "@xmath44 itself is the physical arc element that is conformally related to the kinetic arc element by the overall conformal factor @xmath45 .",
    "finally , ` ( para)geodesic ' indeed implies ` geometrical ' . moreover , in the given examples this refers to a particularly simple notion of geometry .",
    "i.e. riemannian geometry in the first two cases and semi - riemannian  indefinite - signature  geometry in the last case .",
    "the geometrical arc - element for these all take the _",
    "quadratic _ form of the square root of a sum of squares as given in the above expression for the action .",
    "synge s extension @xcite involves a wider range of physical theories being encoded by action principles built out of arc elements that encode more general notions of geometry than the above .",
    "the following consequences ensue .",
    "i ) dirac @xcite noted that primary constraints are implied by reparametrization - invariant actions .",
    "this argument clearly carries over to geometrical actions that happen to be , dually , parametrization - irrelevant actions .",
    "thus it can be recast as ` primary constraints are implied by temporally - relational actions ' .",
    "thus how the action for minisuperspace gr manages to encode the hamiltonian constraint , : = n_ijkl^ij^kl/ - r = 0 .",
    "[ ham ] this is relevant because in the more commonly used adm approach , ( [ ham ] ) arises from variation with respect to the lapse , which in turn is necessarily absent from misner s action for this to implement temporal relationalism .",
    "so there is an initial worry that the crucial constraint @xmath46 may , somehow , have gone missing . however , dirac s insight pin - points",
    "how upon formulating gr free of lapse , a distinct primary constraint route takes the place of the variation with respect to the lapse route to @xmath46 of the adm formulation .",
    "thus in the background - independent paradigm for physics , the important hamiltonian constraint of gr @xmath46 arises directly from the demand of temporal relationalism . indeed , furthermore , the precise form of the gr @xmath46 is dictated by the precise ( quadratic ) way the action is built to be temporally relational .",
    "this in turn induces @xmath46 s quadratic dependence on the momenta , which , moreover , is well - known to cause the schrdinger picture manifestation of the most well - known quantum problem of time facet : the frozen formalism problem .",
    "thus indeed temporal relationalism the background independence aspect is a deeper and already classically - present replacement for the ` frozen formalism problem ' problem of time facet . for spatially - absolute mechanics following from the jacobi action , the quadratic energy constraint : = _",
    "i^2/2m_i + v(^i ) = e plays an analogous role to @xmath46 , and the @xmath47 , @xmath48 of this does likewise for 1-@xmath7 scaled rpm . in each case , the quadratic form of the geometrical arc - element in the action gives rise to a purely quadratic constraint ` quad ' that then results in a quantum frozen formalism problem .",
    "this is the first of a number of justifications for considering such mechanics as useful model arenas for conceptually understanding some parts of the more elaborate case of gr itself .",
    "\\ii ) the above primary - level timelessness from adopting the background independence leibniz s principle of temporal relationalism is , moreover , both already classically present and easier to reconcile with time nonetheless appearing to play a prominent role in the world around us .",
    "this reconciliation involves classical time being emergent at a secondary level via _",
    "mach s time principle _ : ` time is to be abstracted from change '",
    ". three distinct proposals for this then involve ` any change ' ( rovelli @xcite ) , ` all change ' ( barbour @xcite ) and my _ sufficient totality of locally significant change ( stlrc ) _ @xcite .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , all three of these proposals have some sense in which they are ` democratic ' however , only the last two take into consideration that ` some clocks are better than others ' is an essential part of accurate timekeeping @xcite . additionally , only the first and the third are operationally realizable .",
    "thus overall , stlrc wins out .",
    "the time abstracted from this is a _ generalization _ of the astronomers _ ephemeris time _ @xcite that emphasizes that such a procedure is in practise _",
    "local_. thus i term it a ` glet ' , and posit the specialization of the machian emergent time resolution to ` glet is to be abstracted from stlrc ' .    for the actions in question , _ emergent jacobi time _",
    "is such an emergent time .",
    "this time arises as a simplifier @xcite of the change - momentum relations and jacobi equation of motion .",
    "these are the temporal relationalism complying equivalents of velocity - momentum relations and euler  lagrange equations .",
    "it takes the form to incorporate selection of ` calendar year zero ' , @xmath49 . ]",
    "^ ( ) = s / . .",
    "at first sight , this is an ` all change ' resolution , but a careful look reveals that in practise it is indeed a ` stlrc ' resolution .",
    "it amounts to a relational recovery of newtonian , proper and cosmic times in the contexts in which one expects to have each such notion of time .",
    "finally , suppose that one is in the presence of a heavy  light ( @xmath50@xmath51 ) split , such as for cosmology for @xmath50 scale and @xmath51 small inhomogeneities .",
    "then this scheme is only fully machian once one passes from zeroth - order emergent times of the form ^()_0 = f[h , h ] to at least - first order emergent times of the form @xcite ^()_1 = f[h , l , h , l ] .",
    "[ temj1 ] such schemes indeed provide the classical @xmath51-degrees of freedom with the opportunity to contribute to the timestandard .",
    "\\i ) now as well as starting with a geometrically - simple but redundant configuration space @xmath2 , one considers also a group @xmath52 of continuous transformations acting on the @xmath2 that are taken to be physically irrelevant .",
    "this encompasses both    \\a ) _ spatial relationalism _ : translations and rotations relative to absolute space in mechanics , or 3-diffeomorphisms in gr .",
    "b ) _ internal relationalism _ : a reformulation of the more familiar type of gauge theories from particle physics .",
    "the meaning of configurational relationalism is that the true physics resides in the quotient space @xmath53 .",
    "for example , for scaled rpm s this is _ relational space _ @xmath54 . for pure - shape ( i.e. additionally scale - free ) rpm s ,",
    "it is _ shape space _ @xmath55 . here",
    "rot(@xmath7 ) are rotations , dil are dilations and denotes semidirect product . on the other hand , for gr @xmath53",
    "is usually taken to be wheeler s @xcite _ superspace _ , superspace(@xmath20 ) = riem(@xmath20)/diff(@xmath20 ) .",
    "moreover cases can be made to consider _ conformal superspace _ , cs(@xmath20 )",

    "v stands for ` volume ' , i.e. the spatial volume of @xmath20  a merely global - valued variable .",
    "then vpconf(@xmath20 ) are volume - preserving conformal transformations .",
    "conformal superspace is the space of conformal 3-geometries , so this case is a theory of _",
    "conformogeometrodynamics_. \\{cs + v}(@xmath20 ) adjoins to this the dynamics of a single volume degree of freedom .",
    "both of these spaces have close ties to prevalent approaches to the initial - value problem for gr @xcite .",
    "configurational relationalism can be mathematically implemented in an indirect manner in a very wide range of circumstances by the following ` @xmath52-act @xmath52-all ' method .",
    "given an object @xmath56 that corresponds to the theory with configuration space @xmath2 , one first applies a group - action of @xmath52 to this  denoted @xmath57 .",
    "then one applies some operation @xmath58 that makes use of all of the @xmath59 so as to cancel out the appearance of @xmath60 in the group action , such as summing , integrating , averaging or extremizing over @xmath52 .",
    "one example of such an implementation is for @xmath56 a classical action built upon @xmath2 with application of the basic infinitesimal group - action to obtain s _ = _ ( ) _ g s , _ gs : = ||- _ g || _ .",
    "then one extremizes over @xmath52 as per the variational principle now also including variation with respect to @xmath60 .. ] this particular example is barbour s _ best matching _",
    "the extremization produces an equation , lin@xmath61 , that , in the @xmath62 variables formulation , is to be solved for the auxiliary variables @xmath63 themselves and then substituted back into the action .",
    "this produces a final @xmath52-independent expression that _ directly _ implements configurational relationalism .",
    "note the extra @xmath64 factor in the gr case .    in more detail",
    ", this method initially looks to be ` taking a step in the wrong direction ' by extending @xmath2 to the bundle @xmath65 that appends the further unphysical @xmath52-auxiliary degrees of freedom to the redundancies already present in @xmath2 .",
    "however , lin@xmath61 , thus named for its linearity in the momenta , is , unlike the preceding quadratic constraints , uncontroversially a gauge constraint .",
    "gauge constraints these use up _ two _ degrees of freedom per @xmath60 degree of freedom .",
    "thus each degree of freedom appended wipes out not only itself but also one of @xmath2 s redundancies , so that one indeed ends up on @xmath53 as required to implement configurational relationalism .",
    "note that the expression given involves formulating the actually - present auxiliary variables as @xmath63 rather than as , in the earlier literature @xcite , @xmath60 .",
    "this is necessary for these not to spoil the parametrization - irrelevance that implements temporal relationalism .",
    "moreover , then one might naively expect cyclic equations ( jacobi @xmath66 parallel of the conventional lagrangian @xmath67 ) in place of multiplier equations ( jacobi @xmath68 parallel of the conventional lagrangian @xmath69 ) .",
    "however , @xmath60 is entirely physically meaningless .",
    "thus in particular its value at the end points ( or , more generally , end nos ) of the variation are meaningless .",
    "so it is to be subjected to free end nos variation , and this fixes @xmath70 at the end nos , but @xmath71 is @xmath72-constant , so @xmath70 everywhere .",
    "thus using cyclic differentials @xmath63 in place of a lagrange multiplier implementation of the @xmath52-auxiliaries leaves the equations of one s theory unchanged .",

    "both these limitations are to be expected since refoliation invariance is a diffeomorphism - specific issue .",
    "moreover , just as dirac pointed out that foliation of minkowski spacetime by arbitrary spatial 3-surfaces does involve diffeomorphism - specific issues , a similar treatment does also exist for minisuperspace cosmologies .",
    "finally , hojman - kucha - teitelboim @xcite obtained the form of @xmath46 from less assumptions than forming the adm split of spacetime gr .",
    "they proceeded via the deformation algebroid for a hypersurface taking the form of the already - known dirac algebroid .",

    "they assumed temporal and configurational relationalism instead .",
    "thus their approach additionally amounts to a classical spacetime reconstruction ( from space ) .",
    "another kind of spacetime reconstruction would be from a discrete ontology rather than a continuum [ whether for spacetime or for space : fig 2.f ) ] .",
    "we shall see in sec [ qm - sec ] that spacetime reconstruction is further motivated at the quantum level , but it does already admit a classical precursor . in general , if classical spacetime is not assumed , one needs to get it back in a suitable limit .",
    "this can be hard ; in particular , the less structure is assumed , the harder a venture it is .    in the case of assuming a space continuum , mere consistency imposed by the dirac procedure whittles down a general ansatz to one of four alternatives .",
    "i.e. lorentzian , galilean , carrollian relativity and cmc ( constant mean curvature ) slicing @xcite .",
    "these arise together as the different ways to kill off an obstruction term that is a product of four factors .",
    "it is novel for such an alternative to arise from principles of dynamics considerations .",

    "one might guess that @xmath107 could be viewed as beables in the distinct sense of bergmann .",
    "this is because both are gauge - invariant path notions .",
    "a path in geometrodynamical phase space corresponds to sweeping out a slicing of a spacetime , encoding both the sequence of 3-metrics and the extrinsic curvature of each of these .",
    "however , bergmann and komar @xcite note that these have invariances much larger than diff(@xmath96 ) , and their position is that the largest group of invariances is to be taken .",
    "thus their @xmath109 are distinct from @xmath107 by their connection to a larger group digg(@xmath96 )  the diffeomorphism induced gauge group  in place of diff(@xmath96 ) .    on the other hand , in classical histories theory @xcite , classical paths in configuration space ( which represent particular slicings of spacetime ) are elevated to have a similar canonical status to ordinary configurations .",
    "i.e. they are taken to possess conjugate _",

    "d^t _ _ = 0 , each of which closes as an algebra by the corresponding jacobi identity . due to having",

    "but even then it is still only a quantum - level name , whereas the term * constraint closure problem * extends it to include its classical counterpart too .    at the quantum level",

    "note 4 ) a ) , b ) and c ) need not always be subfacets of the constraint closure problem because some instances of them are unrelated to time , space or frames . thus in this case these play no part in background independence or the problem of time .",
    "\\4 ) the * problem of observables * @xcite has been argued to be better named and conceived of as the * problem of beables*. this is now not only as regards the cosmological setting but also as regards the non - existence of ordinary qm s notion of observers or measuring apparatuses in many relevant universe regimes .",

    "the reason that the above can not be considered is that , whilst they can be cast in leibnizian form , fail to have an ` all change ' or ` stlrc ' machian resolution of temporal relationalism .",
    "i.e. classical fermionic change can not enter the expression for the emergent classical machian time .",
    "thus the relational status of fermions ( and consequently of supergravity and m - theory ) need to be studied specifically at the quantum level , which is beyond what the current article can cover .",
    "example 5 ) perturbative strings and covariant perturbative quantization of gravity are also excluded on grounds of possessing background metric structures .",
    "thus two major future directions for this work are considering how one can relationally formulate each of a ) supersymmetry specifically at the quantum level and b ) theories possessing extended objects ( such as strings or branes ) . a third future direction concerns semiclassical and fully quantum understanding of whether and how constraint closure , refoliation invariance and spacetime reconstruction of classical gr carry over .",
    "a fourth future direction is considering the classical and quantum discrete counterpart of the current paper .",
    "e.g. @xcite has taken a number of useful steps in this direction .",
    "[ spacetime reconstruction becomes more formidable in many such approaches , and the status of diffeomorphism invariance is less well studied than in the continuum case . ]",

    "<S> this paper concerns what background independence itself is ( as opposed to some particular physical theory that is background independent ) . </S>",
    "<S> the notions presented mostly arose from a layer - by - layer analysis of the facets of the problem of time in quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> part of this coincides with two relational postulates which are thus identified as classical precursors of two of the facets of the problem of time . </S>",
    "<S> these are furthemore tied to the forms of each of the gr hamiltonian and momentum constraints . </S>",
    "<S> other aspects of background independence include the algebraic closure of these constraints , expressing physics in terms of beables , foliation independence as implemented by refoliation invariance , the reconstruction of spacetime from space . </S>",
    "<S> the final picture is that background independence  a philosophically desirable and physically implementable feature for a theory to have  has the facets of the problem of time among its consequences . </S>",
    "<S> thus these arise naturally and are problems to be resolved , as opposed to avoided ` by making one s physics background - dependent in order not to have these problems ' . </S>",
    "<S> this serves as a selection criterion that limits the use of a number of model arenas and physical theories .    </S>",
