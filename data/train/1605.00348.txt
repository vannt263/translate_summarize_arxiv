    "entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum physics and is the key resource in many quantum information processing tasks .",
    "so it is quite natural and important to develop a theoretical framework to describe and quantify it . in spite of a series of remarkable recent progress in the theory of entanglement ( for reviews",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , many fundamental questions or challenges still remain open .",
    "one of the most significant questions is to determine the _ distillable entanglement _ @xmath1 , i.e. the highest rate at which one can obtain maximally entangled states from an entangled state by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite .",
    "this fundamental measure fully captures the ability of given state shared between distant parties ( alice and bob ) to generate strongly correlated qubits in order to allow reliable quantum teleportation or quantum cryptography .",
    "however , up to now , how to calculate @xmath1 for general quantum states still remains unknown . also , in many practical applications , resources are finite and the number of entanglement are quite limited .",
    "it is also of importance to study the deterministic distillable entanglement of finite entanglement transformations .",
    "to evaluate the distillation rates efficiently , one possible way is to find computable upper bounds .",
    "a well - known upper bound of the distillable entanglement is the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) @xcite , which expresses the minimal distinguishability between the given state and all possible separable states .",
    "an improved bound is the rains bound @xcite , which is arguably the best known upper bound of distillable entanglement .",
    "the best known sdp upper bound is @xmath2 in ref . @xcite and it is an improved version of the _ logarithmic negativity _ @xcite . in ref @xcite ,",
    "the logarithmic negativity is proved to be a proper entanglement monotone for the first time .",
    "other known upper bounds of @xmath1 are studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . unfortunately , most of these known upper bounds are difficult to compute @xcite and usually easily computable only for states with high symmetries , such as werner states , isotropic states , or the family of `` iso - werner '' states @xcite .",
    "entanglement cost @xmath3 @xcite is another fundamental measure in entanglement theory , which quantifies the rate for converting maximally entangled states to the given state by locc alone .",
    "however , computing @xmath3 is np - hard @xcite and the entanglement cost is known only for a few of quantum states @xcite . even under the ppt operations ,",
    "there are only bounds for the exact entanglement cost @xcite .    since both distillable entanglement and the entanglement cost are important but difficult to compute , it is of great significance to find the best approach to efficiently evaluate them .",
    "as rains bound is proved to be equal to the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement ( with respect to ppt states ) for werner states @xcite and orthogonally invariant states @xcite , one open problem is to determine whether these two quantities always coincide @xcite .",
    "another significant open problem is whether rains bound is additive , and it was conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite that rains bound might be additive for arbitrary quantum states .    in this paper",
    ", we resolve the above two open problems about rains bound by explicitly exhibiting a special class of two - qubit states whose rains bound and relative entropy of entanglement are known .",
    "we show that the rains bound is not additive and thereby the asymptotic ( or regularized ) rains bound will give a better upper bound on distillable entanglement . meanwhile , the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement ( w.r.t .",
    "ppt states ) of these two - qubit states is strictly smaller than the rains bound .",
    "furthermore , an sdp lower bound @xmath0 for the asymptotic rains bound is introduced and it is the first computable lower bound for entanglement cost of general bipartite quantum states . meanwhile , this bound is proved to be the best known upper bound of the deterministic distillable entanglement , which gives the ppt - assisted asymptotic rate for some states , including all the pure states and the mixed states @xmath4 in ref . @xcite .",
    "before we present our main results , let us first review some notations and preliminaries . in the following",
    "we will frequently use symbols such as @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) to denote ( finite - dimensional ) hilbert spaces associated with alice and bob , respectively .",
    "the set of linear operators over @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "note that for a linear operator @xmath10 over a hilbert space , we define @xmath11 , and the trace norm of @xmath10 is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the complex conjugate of @xmath10 .",
    "the operator norm @xmath14 is defined as the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath15 . a positive semidefinite operator @xmath16 is said to be ppt if @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the concise definition of entanglement of distillation by locc is given in ref .",
    "@xcite as follows : @xmath19=0\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 ranges over locc operations and @xmath21 represents the standard @xmath22 maximally entangled state .",
    "when @xmath20 ranges over ppt operations , the ppt - assisted distillable entanglement is defined by @xmath23 .",
    "the rains bound was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and refined in ref .",
    "@xcite as a convex optimization problem as follows : @xmath24 in this formula , @xmath25 denotes the relative von neumann entropy .",
    "rains bound is important in entanglement theory and the generalized rains information of a quantum channel is recently proved to be a strong converse rate for quantum communication @xcite .",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) @xcite with respect to the ppt states is given by the following convex optimization problem : @xmath26 for a general bipartite state @xmath27 , it holds that @xmath28 .",
    "however , @xmath29 equals to @xmath30 for every two - qubit state @xmath27 @xcite or the bipartite state with one qubit subsystem @xcite .",

    "this algorithm provides an estimation @xmath45 with an absolute error smaller than @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath47 .    the sdp upper bound on distillable entanglement @xmath48 for a bipartite state @xmath27 is introduced in ref .",
