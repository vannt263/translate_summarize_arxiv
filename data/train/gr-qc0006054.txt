    "the universe at large appears to be remarkably homogeneous and isotropic and its dynamics governed by the gravitational force created by its material content . in such a flrw geometry mach s principle , that is the idea that local inertial frames are determined by an average motion of the matter in the universe , can hardly be put to test because of the too high symmetry of the model .",
    "however the universe is not perfectly homogeneous and isotropic : perturbations are present , in particular on very large scales , as testified by the discovery by the cobe satellite of cosmic microwave background anisotropies as well as the observations of voids with size not negligible with respect to the hubble radius [ 1 ]",
    ". such perturbations , which ought to be treated within a general - relativistic framework , could be used to test , at least in principle , mach s ideas - in a similar spirit as they were studied in the case of the flrw ( and of lematre - tolman - bondi ) universes in [ 12 ] . in particular ,",
    "if we happened to live in a slowly rotating void , that is an underdense region separated from the almost flrw universe outside by a slowly rotating sheet - like structure or wall , then the apparent motion of distant stars could be used to measure the angular velocity of the wall , that is the transverse component of its peculiar velocity , which is inaccessible to the usual redshift measurements .    as a first approach to this idea of using mach s principle in observational cosmology",
    "we shall here address the question of how to measure a global rotational velocity field in the universe .",
    "to do so we shall study a very simplified model which however encaptures the physics of the problem : we shall consider an empty void separated from the almost flrw ( dust ) universe outside by a spherically symmetric , slowly rotating shell comoving with the outer universe .",
    "if the assumption of spherical symmetry is reasonable , the assumption of an empty void , on the other hand , is drastic and will force us to consider very heavy shells which can not be treated perturbatively .",
    "however , since we are only interested here in the observable effects of the slow _ rotation _ of the shell , its weight is not so important .",
    "finally the assumption that the shell is comoving with the cosmic dust means that we consider the void long after its possibly explosive creation , when damping forces have slowed it down .",
    "we shall also ignore all perturbations which are not due to the rotation of the shell as they can be linearly added .",
    "such spacetimes have already been studied in the past .",
    "we shall not review here the enormous literature on _ non_-rotating voids in cosmology ( see e.g. [ 2 ] and references therein ) .",
    "rotating voids in cosmology , on the other hand , do not seem to have been much treated .",
    "indeed , slowly rotating voids in asymptotically _",
    "flat _ spacetimes have mainly been used to study machian effects , how and to what extent they are embodied in general relativity .",
    "the classical papers of thirring [ 3 ] , treating a slowly rotating shell of small mass , were generalized by brill and cohen [ 4 ] who considered a slowly rotating shell separating an empty void from the schwarzschild solution at first order in the rotational perturbation .",
    "lindblom and brill [ 5 ] further extended their work by treating a freely falling , slowly rotating shell ; in addition , in order to interpret in physical terms the rotational perturbation inside the shell , they studied the apparent motion of a searchlight at the centre of the shell as seen from infinity .",
    "more recently , katz , lynden - bell and bik [ 6 ] solved the opposite problem ( which is more interesting from the astrophysical point of view ) of how fixed stars at infinity appear to rotate to an inertial observer at the origin of the void .",
    "an evident drawback of all these schwarzschild - shell models is that the whole universe is described by the shell in an asymptotically flat spacetime so that all rotations are defined with respect to the inertial frames at infinity .",
    "thus the rotation of all inertial frames within the void is determined , at least in part , by these asymptotic frames that play the role of something given absolutely , and the shell then can not be considered as the only source of inertia in the universe .",
    "lewis [ 8 ] was the first to discuss the dragging in a truly cosmological context .",
    "he considered a slowly rotating shell immersed at a given comoving position into a closed flrw spacetime .",
    "he gave the solution for the rotational perturbation at first order and discussed some machian features of the model .",
    "later , klein [ 7 ] , analysed more in detail a slowly rotating shell immersed at a given comoving position into a flrw spacetime with open flat spatial sections @xmath0 .",
    "he discussed the dragging of inertial frames inside the shell under the condition that the rotational perturbation is caused by the shell only .",
    "he found that perfect dragging ( that is the fact that an inertial observer inside the void measures a zero angular velocity for the shell ) is reached only as the radius of the shell goes to infinity , where the whole matter of the universe is distributed on the shell .",
    "in the next paper [ 14 ] , klein also considered some effects caused by slowly rotating shells in @xmath1 universes to the second order in the angular velocity .    in section ii of the present paper",
    "we analyze , in contrast to [ 7,8 ] , the rotating voids in _ all _ types of the flrw universes in a _ unified _ manner , pointing out the differences between the open and closed cases .",
    "we give the spacetime metric as well as all angular velocities in terms of two parameters - of a constant characterizing the angular momentum of the shell , and of the comoving radius of the shell .",
    "using bardeen s formalism [ 10 ] to treat the rotational perturbation at first order we calculate the dragging of inertial frames inside the void and determine the conditions for perfect dragging to occur . for einstein - de sitter",
    "universes @xmath0 we recover , in an alternative way , the results of klein [ 7 ] .",
    "we extend his work to all open models @xmath2 and closed models , where new features arise , as , for example , the condition that the total angular momentum of the universe must vanish .",
    "we illustrate that perfect dragging can not be reached in a closed universe .    in section iii",
    "we analyze , in the spirit of katz , lynden - bell and bik [ 6 ] , the apparent motion of the distant stars as seen by observers inside a void .",
    "as we are aware of , this problem has not been tackled before in a cosmological context .",
    "we thus study the propagation of light in the spacetimes obtained and describe how the two parameters of the problem , the angular momentum of the shell and its comoving radius , could in principle be measured .    in the last section",
    "iv we argue that ( slow ) rotations in the open universes are absolute in the sense that there is no freedom to choose rotating axes .",
    "one is thus left with a preferred coordinate system and hence with the possibility to define all rotations with respect to this system . on the other hand , there is no such system in closed universes .",
    "we finally discuss the machian features of the model .",
    "aware of the controversies connected with the formulation and interpretation of mach s principle [ 11 ] , , [ 16 ] and ref .",
    "a short history and meaning of mach s principle is reviewed in [ 12 ] .",
    "] we express all rotations in terms of , in principle , measurable quantities .",
    "the observations of the shell and the cosmic dust outside the shell , made by inertial observers inside , are in full conformity with mach s ideas ( for both open and closed universes ) : the matter of the models considered is not observed to be globally ( slowly ) rotating in a preferred direction . in this sense the inertial frames inside the void are determined by the average motion of the matter in the universe in the spirit of mach s principle .    details of calculations of the matching across the shell , of the rotational metric perturbation outside the shell , and of the angular velocity of a star measured inside the void are given in appendices a , b , c .",
    "the void is empty so that spacetime inside the void can be represented by a portion of minkowski space . consider a family of standard clocks at rest with respect to each other - they define an inertial frame @xmath3 with the line element ds^2|_in =- d|t^2+d|r^2+|r^2(d^2+^2d|^2),where @xmath4 is the time measured by the clocks and @xmath5 their spherical coordinates .",
    "now one can use another time coordinate @xmath6 such that @xmath7 where the lapse function @xmath8 is to be specified later .",
    "one can also use coordinates which rotate with respect to @xmath5 , in such a way that @xmath9 where the angular velocity @xmath10 is a function of @xmath6 . in this new ( rotating ) frame @xmath11 with coordinates @xmath12 the line element ( [ 1 ] ) to first order in @xmath10 reads ds^2|_in=-^2(t)dt^2+d|r^2+|r^2(d^2+^2d^2)-2|r^2 _ 0(t)^2ddt .    the shell is supposed to be spherically symmetric .",
    "its equation of motion can thus be written as @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is for the moment an arbitrary function of time .",
    "the metric induced on the shell by ( [ 2 ] ) is then ds^2|_in^=-[^2(t)-^2(t)]dt^2+l^2(t ) ( d^2+^2d^2 - 2_0(t)^2ddt),where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the shell .    outside the void",
    ", the universe is supposed to be almost perfectly homogeneous and isotropic , up to a rotational perturbation .",
    "there exists therefore a coordinate system in which the line element reads ds^2|_out =- dt^2+a^2(t).as usual , the curvature index @xmath17 for respectively spherical , flat or hyperbolic spatial sections , @xmath18 is the scale factor and function @xmath19 is the rotational metric perturbation . for the perturbation theory at first order to apply it must be small , that is @xmath20 .",
    "we will also suppose that the shell is comoving with the cosmic dust , thus placed at a constant comoving radius @xmath21 .",
    "the metric induced on such a shell by ( [ 5 ] ) then reads ds^2|_out^=-dt^2+a^2(t)l_0 ^ 2 , where @xmath22 is the value of the rotational perturbation on the shell  : @xmath23 .",
    "let us now complete the matching of the two coordinate grids on the shell .",
    "the induced metrics ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) must be continuous [ 9 ] , [ 15 ] .",
    "this first gives the radial position of the shell @xmath14 in terms of its comoving coordinate @xmath24 and the scale factor @xmath18 as l(t)=l_0 a(t ) .",
    "second it implies that the angular velocity @xmath10 and the time shift @xmath8 of the coordinate system @xmath11 with respect to the system @xmath3 are _ 0(t)=_0(t),(t)=.    israel s junction conditions [ 9 ] , [ 15 ] give the stress - energy tensor of the shell in terms of the jump in its extrinsic curvature ( see appendix a ) .",
    "if we consider the shell to be a rotating 2-dimensional perfect fluid , we can write _",
    "ab=(_+p_)w_aw_b+p__ab , w^a=(1,0,_),where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are respectively the shell energy density and surface pressure and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 being the azimuthal coordinate of a fixed point of the shell in the outside coordinates ) , @xmath29 being the proper time on the shell . ]",
    "is the angular velocity of the shell with respect to the outside coordinate grid or , also , with respect to the rotating frame @xmath11 inside the void .",
    "the indices @xmath30 stand for @xmath31 and are raised and lowered by the induced metric on the shell ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "the matching conditions ( app.a , eq.([14 ] ) ) result in _ ( t)&=&14g1al_0(- ) , + p_(t)&=&-12_-18gl_0a , + _ ( t)&=&_0(t)-116ga(_+p_)r|_0 , where we define @xmath32 .",
    "the energy density and pressure of the shell are determined in terms of @xmath24 and the scale factor , and its angular velocity will be known once the metric perturbation @xmath19 is determined .",
    "we note that @xmath33 is always positive and that the equation of state of the shell differs in general from that of the flrw universe outside .",
    "a number of global quantities can be associated with the shell .",
    "for example we can define its total ( proper ) mass as m_(t)=4a^2l_0 ^ 2_= al_0g(-).note that this mass is _ not _ equal to the ( proper ) mass @xmath34 of the universe which has to be removed in order to create the void . indeed m_(t)&=&a2ga^2l_0 ^ 3k=0 + m_(t)&=&3a4g(1+a^2)(_0-l_0)k=1 ( and a similar expression for @xmath35 ) . only in the the case of voids small",
    "compared to the hubble and curvature radii ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) do @xmath38 and @xmath34 coincide .",
    "otherwise , in general , @xmath39 . in any case , unless the void is much larger than the hubble radius , which is unlikely for causality reasons , @xmath38 represents a sizeable fraction of @xmath34 and therefore is large , which is not surprising since we assumed the void to be totally empty .",
    "more interesting is the angular momentum of the shell j_=_t^t _  dd,@xmath40 being the determinant of the induced metric ( [ 9 ] ) , which is conserved due to the axial symmetry of the problem at hand . using the decomposition ( [ 15]-[16 ] ) it can be rewritten as j_=83a^4l_0 ^ 4(_-_0)(_+p_)= -16gl_0 ^ 4a^3r|_0 .",
    "the source which governs the outside metric ( [ 5 ] ) is the stress - energy tensor of the cosmic dust : t_=u_u_,u^=(1,0,0,),where @xmath41 is the metric ( [ 5 ] ) , @xmath42 is the energy density of the dust , and @xmath43 is its ( small ) angular velocity .",
    "einstein s equations for the rotational metric perturbation @xmath19 are solved in appendix b. they give ( t , r)=-1a^3((r)+g(t ) ) , where ( r)=-2gr^3(1 + 2kr^2)j_+6g_l_0^rj(r^)r^4dr^. the radially dependent function @xmath44 , j(r)_l_0^rt^t _",

    "hence , the first term on the right hand side of ( [ 27 ] ) , proportional to @xmath46 , comes from the rotating shell while the second term is the contribution of cosmic matter outside the shell .    as for the function @xmath47",
    ", it is clear that it can be absorbed in the azimuthal coordinate @xmath48 and thus expresses the possibility to choose any global ( slowly ) rotating axes , i.e. the frame @xmath11 , but we keep this freedom for later purposes .",
    "einstein s equations thus yield us the metric perturbation @xmath19 in terms of the function of time @xmath47 and the radial dependent function @xmath44 .",
    "these functions will be determined by boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath49 _ the case of open universes _    in open universes the function @xmath47 is determined uniquely by the condition @xmath50 for all radii @xmath51 so that the perturbation @xmath19 must die away at infinity at least as @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath53 vanishes , as will be the case , this amounts , by ( [ 25 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) , to choosing the coordinate system in such a way that g(t)=0k=0;g(t)=-4gj_k=-1.the metric ( [ 2 ] ) inside the void is then completely known : @xmath8 and @xmath10 are given by ( [ 11 ] ) and _ 0(t)&=&2gj_a^3l_0 ^ 3k=0 + _ 0(t)&=&2gj_a^3l_0 ^ 3k=-1 .",
    "let us finally turn to the metric outside the shell which still depends on the ( so far unknown ) function @xmath44 .",
    "the conservation laws for the dust universe imply @xmath54 so that from ( [ 22 ] ) we deduce that the combination @xmath55 does not depend on time .",

    "it is not determined uniquely just by requiring @xmath58 at infinity and can in principle be fixed by initial conditions or deduced from observations .",
    "however , if we demand , in accord with klein [ 7 ] , that the only source for the rotational perturbation @xmath59 at any @xmath51 is the shell itself ( brought in some way into a slow rotation ) , we eliminate the contribution of the cosmic dust in ( [ 27 ] ) by choosing @xmath60 . then ( t , r)=(t , r)j(r)=0 .    with the condition ( [ 31 ] )",

    "the light emitted from sources placed on the shell , and just behind it , propagates in minkowski spacetime and is observed with zero cosmological redshift .",

    "@xmath149 , where the redshift corresponds to the distance between @xmath76 and @xmath94 , determines , together with @xmath142 , both @xmath46 and @xmath76 .",
    "one can alternatively measure the angular velocities of distant stars at known redshifts and read off the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath76 from the curves at fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the angular velocity of the shell then follows from ( [ a23 ] ) or ( [ a24 ] ) . for given values of @xmath46 and @xmath76 ,",
    "the angular velocities of distant stars at known redshifts depend on the type of the flrw model so that their measurement can also in principle determine the curvature index @xmath150 .",
    "it is clear that above results depend quantitatively on our choice of the function @xmath64 expressing the initial condition on the motion of the cosmic matter outside the shell - another choice in ( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 35 ] ) would have led to a different redshift dependence of @xmath151 .",
    "the actual measurement of the redshift dependence of @xmath151 would then determine @xmath64 .",
    "note however that the angular velocity of the shell , @xmath142 , does not depend on the choice of @xmath64 , see eq.([a22 ] ) .",
    "we note also that since @xmath152 depends on time , we can not require @xmath153 .",
    "hence , a discontinuity in the angular velocities @xmath142 , @xmath104 at the shell occurs for any choice of @xmath64 .",
    "the determination of the void radius , allowed only thanks to the presence of the rotational perturbation , is crucial for the observer inside the void . only if @xmath76 is known , one can properly adjust the redshift method to measure distances -",
    "this would not be possible inside a void in a non - perturbed flrw universe .",
    "the inertial frame @xmath3 attached to the centre of the void , as well as other inertial frames in the void all rotate with the same angular velocity with respect to the rotating frame @xmath11 or , equivalently , with respect to the observers inside the shell fixed at constant @xmath154 .",

    "the preferred observers are not in general freely falling ; in expanding and collapsing stages when @xmath158 they fall freely at the radii where the rotational perturbation vanishes .",
    "the choice of @xmath47 in ( [ 28 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) implies that the preferred observers fall freely at infinity in open cases , and at a certain @xmath83 in closed cases ( see discussion below eq.([39 ] ) ) .    in the open universes",
    "the rotating axes were fixed uniquely by the condition @xmath50 . in this frame",
    "physically realizable preferred observers cover the whole outer universe and can be defined as _ globally non - rotating_. the frame dragging inside a void in the open universes can thus be regarded as _ absolute _ with respect to these observers .    in a closed universe ,",
    "on the other hand , the value of the rotational perturbation at the shell , @xmath22 , is a gauge dependent quantity .",
    "the function @xmath47 can be used to choose any arbitrary path @xmath159 as a locus of freely falling preferred observers , or to choose any value for @xmath22 ( cf .",

    "the preferred observers fall freely at the shell and the spatial axes of the two frames @xmath3 and @xmath11 coincide .",
    "hence , the dragging of inertial frames inside a void in closed universes is _ relative _ , i.e. depending on the choice of gauge .",
    "now , since we have expressed all rotations in terms of mesurable quantities @xmath104 and @xmath142 ( their gauge invariance being evident since @xmath47 cancels out in both ( @xmath162 ) and ( @xmath163 ) we shall confront the observation of the angular velocity distribution of matter in the universe , made by inertial observers inside the void , directly with mach s ideas . by _",

    "this behaviour is in agreement with klein s result [ 7 ] and can be interpreted from a machian point of view as follows :    \\1 ) when the radius of the shell is getting large , almost all matter of the universe can be regarded as redistributed on the shell . in this case , the angular velocity of the shell fully determines the angular velocity distribution of the matter in the universe and the frame dragging becomes perfect .",
    "this is in full conformity with mach s ideas since the universe does not rotate relative to local inertial frames inside the void .",
    "\\2 ) in an expanding universe , the matter density as well as the rotational perturbation decrease as a function of time ; hence the influence of the matter on the inertial frames diminishes so that in this limiting case the dragging inside the void becomes perfect .",
    "@xmath49 _ the case of closed universes _",
    "when the universe is closed , @xmath142 is positive for all times @xmath108 and for all comoving positions of the shell @xmath76 ; it never vanishes ( fig.[fig4 ] ) - there is no perfect dragging in closed universes .",
    "since @xmath142 does not depend on the choice of the function @xmath64 , this result holds for any initial angular momentum distribution of the cosmic dust outside the shell .",
    "thus , the influence of the shell on the inertial frames inside the void is always balanced by the cosmic dust moving to conserve the zero total angular momentum of the universe .    in both cases ,",
    "the fact that the whole matter in the universe ( the shell and the cosmic dust ) is not observed inside the void at any finite time to ( slowly ) rotate in a preferred direction is in full agreement with mach s observation .",
    "we thus conclude that inertial frames inside the void are just in this sense determined by the average motion of distant galaxies.",
