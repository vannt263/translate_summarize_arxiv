    "to conclude , we present the main results of the paper .    a bijective map : @xmath4 operators in @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 is constructed and associated with a star - product formalism . for @xmath1 these operators to form a basis in @xmath7 , conditions on matrix @xmath8 are derived . classification of possible matrices @xmath8 and related star - product schemes @xmath9 is accomplished .",
    "this gives rise to a new approach of introducing bases in @xmath7 with desired properties .",
    "one chooses a class of matrices and impose additional limitations .",
    "once matrix @xmath8 is built , a corresponding basis ( set of operators ) in @xmath7 with expected properties appears .",
    "a development of the paper is complemented by illustrating examples .",
    "another substantial result is a series of propositions and corollaries which demonstrate peculiarities of dequantizers and quantizers , especially in a self - dual star - product scheme .",
    "namely , it is proved that there exists no minimal tomographic star - product scheme with dequantizers in the form of povm effects and hermitian semi - positive quantizers . on applying this argument to self - dual schemes",
    ", we have proved that ( i ) there exists no minimal self - dual star - product scheme with dequantizers in the form of povm effects and ( ii ) hermitian dequantizers and quantizers of a self - dual scheme must contain negative eigenvalues .",
    "the achieved results can be useful for an analysis of the following problems which are of great interest for further consideration : symmetric but non - informationally complete structures of arbitrary rank , a relation between symmetric bases in spaces of different dimension , and specific bases in multipartite systems .",
