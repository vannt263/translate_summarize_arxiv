    "more importantly , the generalized kratzer potential model used in this work generates results for the two molecular potentials .",
    "in addition , the numerical results are obtained for the eigenvalues for @xmath8 and @xmath9 diatomic molecules for the two molecular potentials .",
    "the results obtained are compared with other existing results ( eqr , aim and nu ) , and the results agree favourably with other results , see tables @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "tables @xmath22 and @xmath23 show the matrix elements of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , their sum ( @xmath3 ) and their difference ( @xmath4 ) obtained for @xmath8 and @xmath9 diatomic molecules , the results obtained are the same results for the two molecular potentials .",
    "this is because , the matrix elements depend on @xmath133 and @xmath134 only , and not on @xmath135 . hence , the shifted amount @xmath26 , ( in the case of the modified krazter potential ) has no effect on the matrix elements .",
    "the advantage of the present approach is that it enables one to find the energy eigenvalues , eigenfunctions and matrix elements in a simple way .",
    "the approach presented in this study is efficient and is a very useful link for finding the matrix elements from ladder operators .",
    "this approach can be used to find the energy eigenvalues , eigenfunctions and radial matrix elements of the schrdinger equation with a given exactly solvable molecular potentials for various diatomic molecules for any values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 quantum numbers .",
    "the ladder operators constructed in this study , are very useful tools in quantum - mechanical calculations of the various matrix elements based on the kratzer molecular basis function .",
    "furthermore , these operators can be used in constructing coherent states .",
