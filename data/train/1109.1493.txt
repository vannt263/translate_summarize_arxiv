    "@xmath17 nanostructures with impurities of @xmath18-metals are promising materials for devices in opto- and nanoelectronics , spintronics as direct - band material with a high width of the forbidden gap ( @xmath19 ev ) and high bound energy of excitons at room temperature ( @xmath20 mev )  @xcite .",
    "as it is commonly considered , doping the @xmath17 epitaxial films with transition metals co or mn is able to essentially change the local structure of crystalline lattice , which influences on electron and magnetic properties of material .",
    "however , up to date the electronic structure of @xmath18-centers in @xmath17 remains unstudied in detail .",
    "it was shown that magnetic properties of @xmath5-doped @xmath17 films depend on the method of growing  @xcite and structural defects  @xcite . also observed was ferromagnetic ordering in @xmath0 ( @xmath21 ) with the curie temperature @xmath22 @xmath23 , and it was shown that growth in the charge carrier concentration provides enhanced ferromagnetism  @xcite .",
    "for this case , exchange interaction between magnetic impurities is indirect and realized either via charge carriers  @xcite , or defects and/or impurity electron states with a non - zero spin  @xcite , the magnetization value being essentially dependent on the concentration of free charge carriers and fermi level position .",
    "the @xmath24-type conductivity in @xmath17 is caused by oxygen vacancies @xmath25 ( @xmath26  @xmath27 ) as well as interstitial @xmath28 ( @xmath29 @xmath27 )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath24-type @xmath0 where one can observe carrier - induced ferromagnetism above room temperature  @xcite with exchange interaction between localized spins of @xmath30-electrons in the @xmath8 center and electron states of shallow donors with a non - zero spin , offered is the so - called magnetic - polaron model of high - temperature magnetism .",
    "however , the energy of magnetic polaron is sufficiently low  @xcite , and , respectively , no quantitative experimental proofs to support the polaron model are found yet .",
    "there exist some other theoretical models where ferromagnetic ordering is realized due to inhomogeneous distribution of magnetic impurities in crystalline lattice  @xcite .",
    "formation of a special network of nano - sized clusters with various @xmath18-component composition ( spinodal component decomposition ) can be responsible for ferromagnetic ordering at temperatures higher than the room one  @xcite .",
    "a non - significant difference between ionic radii of @xmath8 and @xmath31 in tetrahedral coordination ( ionic radius of @xmath8 is equal to @xmath32 @xmath33 , @xmath31 - @xmath34 @xmath33 ) should promote efficient dissolution of @xmath5 in @xmath17 and cause a weak distortion in crystalline lattice .",
    "as recently shown , @xmath5 solubility in the wurtzite @xmath17 matrix sharply increases with lowering the grain sizes of @xmath17 crystallites .",

    "the electron structure of defect - ion @xmath8 centers in @xmath17 matrix was investigated using the method of resonant raman scattering in the only work  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the resonant raman process under sub - bandgap excitation of @xmath0 polycrystals was explained as based on interaction of @xmath16 phonons with carriers in excited states of @xmath18-impurity center  @xcite . in @xmath17 single crystals implanted with hydrogen and nitrogen atoms , the resonant multi - phonon scattering by n@xmath16-phonons ( @xmath43 @xmath44 ) under sub - bandgap excitation ( @xmath45 @xmath27 )",
    "was interpreted being based on the model for the frhlich mechanism of interaction between @xmath16-phonons and excitons bound with impurities  @xcite . on the other hand , as it was shown for @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) semiconductors , magnetic ordering changes the electron band structure , which can be pronounced in resonance effects observed in raman spectra  @xcite . as a result , one can observe strong multi - phonon processes in @xmath48-scattering that are the result of strong electron - phonon interaction related with excitation of @xmath49-shell in @xmath50 . in raman spectra of @xmath51 ,",
    "the lines of scattering in the vicinity @xmath52 and @xmath53 are observed , and these are slowly shifted to @xmath54 and @xmath55 with increasing the applied magnetic field .",
    "this resonant amplification of raman scattering by @xmath48-phonons with end wave vectors in europium chalcogenides being in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases was interpreted with account of frelich electron - phonon interaction and availability of spin fluctuations . up to date , no investigation of resonant raman scattering in dms @xmath0 under excitation with energies close to electron transitions with participation of @xmath18-states was performed .    in this work",

    "it has been shown that detailed analysis of raman resonance effects in @xmath17 films doped with @xmath5 under sub - bandgap excitation can give information upon electron states of @xmath8 centers and the width of bandgap .",
    "also , we have ascertained a clear dependence between the value ( force ) of electron - phonon interaction and correlation length that corresponds to diameters of the nano - column structure in @xmath17 films , which are obtained using afm and sem structural - morphologic investigations .",

    "it is related with the fact that in the sem image , beside surface relief , considerable contribution is provided by the phase contrast caused by inhomogeneous distribution of @xmath5 atoms in @xmath17 film in the sub - surface of the film with the thickness up to @xmath90-@xmath91  @xmath37 .",
    "the compositional phase contrast is caused by the considerably higher efficiency of electron absorption in @xmath5 atoms as compared with those of @xmath17 matrix ( @xmath89- to @xmath91-times more ) .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to suppose that the observed clear contrast in sem images in the form of light and dark regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig01]f ) may be caused by inhomogeneities in lateral distribution of @xmath5 atoms for @xmath86 @xmath17 sample in the nanometer scale level .",

    "a similar effect was observed in mbe grown @xmath94 films doped with @xmath95 atoms in sem measurements with nanometer spatial resolution  @xcite .",
    "the authors interpreted their obtained maps as inhomogeneous lateral distribution of @xmath95 atoms in local regions of the size close to @xmath96  @xmath37 as spinodal component decomposition of the @xmath97 alloy , which in accord with the theoretical investigation  @xcite can cause appearance of ferromagnetism at room curie temperatures .",
