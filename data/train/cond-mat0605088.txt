    "the fact that the tie lines all have essentially the same slope , independent of reservoir salt concentration , is a physical consequence of strong salt - macroion electrostatic interactions , as described by eq .",
    "( [ mus ] ) .",
    "the influence of nonlinear response on the tie - line slopes is negligible for the parameters here investigated .",
    "the predicted phase separation of charged colloids is remarkable , considering that simple one - component systems , interacting via purely repulsive pair potentials , exhibit only a single fluid phase . within the present theoretical framework ,",
    "phase instability at low salt concentrations is driven by the strong density dependence of the effective interactions , chiefly the one - body volume energy in deionized suspensions .",
    "it should be emphasized that because the colloid and salt concentrations vary between the two phases , the density - dependent effective interactions also differ in the two phases .",
    "the unusual phase separation can be understood , more fundamentally , as the result of a classic competition between entropy and energy .",
    "on one side of the balance , favoring a stable uniform fluid , are the configurational entropies of all ions , represented by the ideal - gas terms in eqs .",
    "( [ e03 ] ) and ( [ ftot ] ) , and the positive potential energy of macroion pair repulsion . on the other side",
    "is the ( density - dependent ) negative potential energy of macroion - counterion attraction [ second term on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ e03 ] ) ] , which favors a concentrated phase with counterions localized around , and thus strongly attracted to , the macroions .    within the  entropy vs. energy \" view , the sensitivity of phase behavior to salt concentration becomes clearer .",
    "at salt concentrations low enough that screening is counterion - dominated and screening lengths are relatively long , the counterion distribution is so diffuse that counterion - macroion attraction is too weak to drive macroion aggregation . with increasing salt concentration , the screening length shortens ,",
    "the counterions become more localized around the macroions , and counterion - macroion attraction may  for sufficiently high macroion valence ",
    "overcome configurational entropy and macroion pair repulsion to drive phase separation . the resulting concentrated phase is energetically favored , the counterions being closer on average to the macroions , but entropically disfavored , since the microions ( excluded by macroion cores ) must occupy a smaller free volume . on the other hand ,",
    "the dilute phase is energetically disfavored , the counterions tending to roam farther from the macroions , but is entropically favored , since the microions can explore a larger free volume . at salt concentrations high enough that screening is salt - dominated , the salt - ion entropy overwhelms the counterion - macroion interaction energy in the free energy and prevents macroion aggregation .",
    "thermodynamic phase behavior qualitatively similar to that depicted in fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram ] has been predicted before  @xcite .",
    "compared with the results of van roij _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , based on essentially the same variational theory for free energies , but a linearized density - functional theory for effective interactions , the present theory predicts a somewhat larger unstable area in the phase diagram .",
    "this quantitative discrepancy results mainly from different treatments of excluded - volume effects in the two approaches .",
    "in particular , the excluded - volume correction to the screening constant in response theory [ @xmath180 factor in eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) ] enhances microion screening and promotes phase instability .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the controversial issue of phase separation in deionized charge - stabilized colloidal suspensions by inputting effective electrostatic interactions from response theory into free energies from a thermodynamic variational theory . by considering both linear and first - order nonlinear approximations for the effective pair potential and one - body volume energy ,",
    "we have systematically assessed the influence of nonlinear screening on phase behavior .",
    "a coexistence analysis results in osmotic pressures [ figs .",
    "[ pressure - lin ] , [ pressure ] , and [ cplin ] ] and phase diagrams [ fig .  [ phase - diagram ] ] that clearly exhibit thermodynamic instability towards phase separation for sufficiently high macroion effective valences and low salt concentrations .    for macroion sizes and effective",
    "valences within limits established by charge renormalization considerations , first - order nonlinear corrections to the effective interactions are relatively weak and can either enhance or diminish stability of the uniform fluid phase , depending on system parameters . in general , the higher the macroion surface charge density , the higher the critical salt concentration and the larger the area of the unstable region in the phase diagram .",
    "our main conclusion is that , within the present model , nonlinear screening appears not to suppress phase separation of deionized suspensions , contradicting conclusions drawn from previous studies  @xcite and raising hope that a similar phenomenon may yet be observed in simulations of the primitive model .    in closing ,",
    "three key approximations of the present approach deserve to be highlighted for further scrutiny .",
    "first , the neglect of higher - order nonlinear corrections to the effective interactions presumes that nonlinear effects are strongest at the one- and two - body levels .",
    "the finding that first - order nonlinear corrections do not qualitatively alter fluid phase behavior suggests that higher - order corrections are unlikely to have drastic consequences  for example , suppression of phase separation .",
    "furthermore , the presumption of weak many - body effective interactions is consistent with the dominance of the volume energy in effective one - component models of simple metals  @xcite , but should be further checked for charged colloids .",
    "second , the mean - field approximation for the response functions of the microion plasma assumes weakly correlated microions .",
    "although usually considered reasonable for monovalent microions , this assumption can and should be checked by more accurately modeling the structure of the microion plasma",
    ". finally , the assumption of fixed macroion valence neglects the dependence of the effective valence on colloid and salt densities .",
    "this interesting issue of coupling between the effective macroion charge and phase behavior is being examined by means of charge renormalization theory and will be the subject of a future paper .",
