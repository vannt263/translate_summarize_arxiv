    "<S> we provide a simple and intuitive one - state vector formalism capable of interpreting their experiment . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we cross - checked our model with a classical - physics based approach and found that both models are in complete agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the quantity used in the mentioned experiment is not a suitable which - path witness producing seemingly contra - intuitive results . to circumvent this issue </S>",
    "<S> , we establish a more reliable which - path witness and show that it yields well expected outcomes of the experiment .    in quantum mechanics ( qm ) particles </S>",
    "<S> are assigned a wave function used to describe their properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach sometimes leads to conclusions about experimental results that seem to contradict intuitive estimations based on classical physics  @xcite . despite this flaw , </S>",
    "<S> qm is currently widely accepted as a theory @xcite , that makes accurate predictions in agreement with the performed experiments . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is considered valid regularly used for the interpretation of the results of the corresponding experiments .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) drawing of the experimental setup with two nested mach - zender interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) power spectrum on detector d shows all frequencies of mirror oscillations for the phase @xmath0 , ( b ) power spectra for @xmath1 , ( c ) power spectrum for phase @xmath1 and the lower path @xmath2 blocked as predicted by our approach . ]    </S>",
    "<S> recently , an experiment that contained counter - intuitive features was proposed and realized by danan _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors used nested mach - zehnder interferometers ( mzi ) , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig ] , and mirrors ( a , b , c , e , f ) vibrating with different frequencies , in order to leave a mark on passing photons . at one selected output port of the interferometer , </S>",
    "<S> the photons were detected by a quad - cell detector d capable of tracing the spatial vibrations of the photon beam . </S>",
    "<S> after measurement , the collected signal was further processed and subjected to the fourier transform . from the obtained frequencies of vibrations , </S>",
    "<S> the authors judged whether the detected photons have interacted with the mirror that was oscillating at this particular frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> the results described in the article by danan _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite were interpreted by means of two - state vector formalism ( tsvf ) and weak values . </S>",
    "<S> both the results and their unusual interpretation were questioned @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the critical comments pertained to the visibility of interference inside the interferometer , the correct application of tsvf , the processing of the obtained data and its validity . </S>",
    "<S> until now , no - one has managed to provide the theoretical calculations and the interpretation of the experimental results using only the standard one - state vector quantum - mechanical approach . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the above - mentioned approach makes it possible to interpret the results from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and verify their congruity with qm . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we would manage to shed more light on the ongoing discussion regarding the legitimacy of the experimental data and its interpretation . in our opinion </S>",
    "<S> , this would be useful for describing experiments similar to @xcite clarifying the debate about the experiment .    in this paper , we present a relevant standard one - state vector formalism and describe the evolution of the state vector as it passes the mzi in the direction of the detector . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the post selection process and derive the probabilities of detecting at particular frequencies ( that correspond to the vibrations of the individual mirrors ) . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results are compared with the experimental data presented by danan _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use classical optics to describe the transverse profiles of the light beams used in the experiment and we apply the result to validate the one - state vector outcomes at the classical limit .    a correct description of danan _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ experiment needs to consider all the photon modes present in the setup . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the spatial modes , additional modes are introduced by vibrations of the mirrors ( referred as the `` frequency modes '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> the modes must be taken into account , since they differentiate , at least in principle , between the respective paths of the photon . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis uses the formalism of annihilation operators and their transformations on beam splitters ( bs ) . </S>",
    "<S> spatial modes are labeled by operators @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 , while the frequency modes are marked by binary numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the five frequency modes are introduced by the mirrors a , b , c , e or f. they are marked by consecutive binary indices after the symbol naming the spatial mode . the index value is either 0 or 1 , indicating whether mode frequency was modulated by a corresponding mirror ( 1 ) or not ( 0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , for instance , if spatial mode @xmath3 was frequency modulated by mirrors a , e and f , it would be indexed as @xmath5 .    at the beginning </S>",
    "<S> the photon is in the mode @xmath6 ( see setup depicted in fig .  [ fig ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first beam - splitter ( bs@xmath7 ) divides the beam with an intensity ratio of 1:2 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the spatial mode gets transformed to @xmath8 in the outer arm , the spatial mode @xmath2 interacts with the vibrating mirror c , while the reflected mode @xmath4 comes into contact with the mirror e. this is described by transition @xmath9    the spatial mode @xmath4 now enters the inner interferometer formed by two balanced beam splitters . </S>",
    "<S> the first beam splitter , bs@xmath10 , transforms it to @xmath11 the vibrating mirrors a and b then have the following effect @xmath12 the difference between the lengths of the upper and lower arms of the inner interferometer introduces an additional phase shift that can be attributed solely to the mode @xmath3 @xmath13    the modes @xmath4 and @xmath3 get recombined on the second beam splitter of the inner interferometer , i.e. , bs@xmath14 . at this point </S>",
    "<S> we disregard the outgoing mode @xmath3 since only the mode @xmath4 can further contribute to photon detection , hence @xmath15 the output mode of the inner interferometer , @xmath4 , meets the last vibrating mirror , f , @xmath16 finally , we recombine the modes @xmath2 and @xmath4 on the last unbalanced beam splitter bs@xmath17 ( identical to bs@xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the final form of the spatial mode @xmath2 , describing photons that reach detector d , is @xmath18    as in the case of the inner interferometer , we discard the output mode @xmath4 that can not lead to photon detection at the detector d. we assume that the photons entering this setup are single photons that can be described in therm of the creation operator @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the output state in the fock basis then reads @xmath20 we use the same labeling for the annihilation operators and frequency modes . </S>",
    "<S> note that the authors of the experiment @xcite set the phase shift in the inner interferometer to @xmath21 [ see fig.2 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ] .    </S>",
    "<S> to explain the results of @xcite , it is crucial to correctly describe the post - selection process caused by photon detection and subsequent frequency mode analysis . </S>",
    "<S> when one particular frequency mode is post - selected , the information about the photon being in a superposition of other frequency modes is erased . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency modes are orthogonal , i.e. , one can perform a direct deterministic signal frequency analysis to distinguish between the modes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , post - selecting a specific frequency mode makes the information about the other frequency modes unavailable .    </S>",
    "<S> post - selection is a well established technique in quantum state engineering used , e.g. , in optimal quantum cloning @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , the post - selection on the photon that interacted with mirror a is formally equivalent to the projection of the output state onto the state @xmath22 where @xmath23 is kronecker s delta . </S>",
    "<S> post - selection on any other mode is also defined by eq  ( [ eq : proja ] ) , where a in kronecker s delta is replaced with a chosen mode , i.e. , @xmath24 for @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> now , one can immediately see from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : finalfock ] ) that @xmath26 and , similarly , @xmath27 the structure of the output state implies that post - selecting modes e and f yields the same results for both . for mode </S>",
    "<S> e one obtains @xmath28 thus , for @xmath1 none of the frequency modes marked as e or f will contribute to the final state . </S>",
    "<S> if the phase shift is set to @xmath0 , both modes will appear as @xmath29 .     </S>",
    "<S> let us use the theoretical framework established above to explain the experimental data in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in case of constructive interference [ @xmath30 , </S>",
    "<S> see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig](a ) ] , all frequencies @xmath31 for @xmath32 are present in the power spectrum recorded by detector d. intensities for frequencies @xmath33 and @xmath34 are four times higher than others because of constructive interference in the inner mzi . </S>",
    "<S> destructive interference appears for @xmath35 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig](b ) ] and it removes the peaks for frequencies @xmath33 and @xmath34 from the power spectrum . the peaks for frequencies @xmath36 and @xmath37 remain constant because post - selecting on mode a or b is equivalent to post - selecting on a photon traveling via the post - selected arm of the inner mzi , so there is no interference at the bs@xmath14 .    the experimental results presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite agree with our theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> if the photon reflected from mirror c is blocked and the phase shift is @xmath35 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig](c ) ] , our theoretical prediction does not match the experimental data from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we predict that @xmath38 should be constant ( similarly to the previously discussed cases ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because it is possible to distinguish between photons reflected from mirrors a and b. when mode post - selection ( power spectrum analysis ) is performed the interference on bs@xmath14 is effectively removed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it should be possible to observe the intensity peaks for @xmath36 and @xmath37 . as we present below , the intensity peaks for @xmath36 and @xmath37 are also predicted by the classical theory of light .    </S>",
    "<S> the classical approach to deriving frequency - mode amplitudes is based on the standard electromagnetic - wave theory ( supplemental material of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we repeated this classical procedure , but we did not keep track of the normalization factors and took only those parts of the expressions that were relevant . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the electric field at the detector d takes in general the form of @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) when mode @xmath42 is open ( closed ) and @xmath43 are small shifts in direction @xmath44 oscillating with frequencies of the relevant mirror labeled with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude expressed using the paraxial approximation reads @xmath46\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) to calculate the intensities in all three scenarios shown in fig .  2 of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the first scenario ( a ) there is constructive interference in the small mzi and mode @xmath42 is open , i.e. , we set @xmath47 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the associated field amplitude reads @xmath48\\\\ \\label{eq : amplitude_a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the measurement performed by danan _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite consists of evaluating the power spectrum of the function @xmath49 the fourier transform of @xmath50 is @xmath51 it provides five peaks in the associated power spectrum @xmath52 , where peaks corresponding to frequencies @xmath53 have four times smaller area than peaks for @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the corresponding intensity difference ratios are 1:2 ( in contrast to our quantum model , which describes a sum of intensities ) .    in the second scenario ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> mode @xmath42 is open ( @xmath55 ) and there is destructive interference in the small mzi ( @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the field amplitude @xmath56\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provides the power spectrum of @xmath52 containing three balanced peaks associated with mirrors a , b and c ( the same result is provided by our quantum model ) .    in the third scenario ( c ) , the mode @xmath42 is blocked ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude @xmath58 in this case provides intensity @xmath59 that is even function of @xmath44 , hence @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , no peaks are observed by danan </S>",
    "<S> _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : amplitude_c ] ) that the amplitude and the resulting intensity oscillates with frequencies @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> it means that these quantities include the information about the photons impinging on the mirrors a and b. however , the specific quantity measured by danan _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ignores this information . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to conclude that @xmath61 is not a reliable which - path witness because it ignores some of the available information .    in order to use the available information to its fullest extent we propose to use spectrum of the overall intensity @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a fourier transform of the field @xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> ( the parameters of which can be established from the setup configuration and @xmath65 measurements ) . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is a more reliable which - path witness and it corresponds to our quantum model . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath66 does not vanish for even @xmath67 ( in contrast to @xmath61 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total intensity @xmath68 contains contributions from the respective mirror frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the weights associated with the specific mirrors can be calculated as @xmath69 , where @xmath31 stands for the respective mirrors frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> this approach produces exactly the same results as obtained by the previously mentioned quantum approach . in scenario ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> , the intensity @xmath68 provides the weights @xmath70 of the five peaks that have the 1:4 ratio . in scenario ( c ) @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> does not hide the which - path information encoded in the presence of frequency peaks corresponding to mirrors a and b ( see fig . [ fig ] ) .    in this paper , we described the spectra at the output port of nested mzi with vibrating mirrors applying both quantum and classical theories of light . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum approach employed the standard formalism of annihilation operators and one - state vectors in fock s basis . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent transverse profiles of beams were described classically and used in the analysis of the spectrum of the electric field . using the classical approach , </S>",
    "<S> we have explained the results observed by danan _ </S>",
