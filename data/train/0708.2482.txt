    "it is a pity that we are now _ not _ able to determine confidently which state of matter really exists in pulsar - like stars due to the difficulty of calculation from the first principles of the elementary strong interaction , even 40 years after the discovery of pulsars .",
    "nuclear matter ( related to _ neutron stars _ ) is one of the speculations even from the landau s time , while quark matter ( related to _ quark stars _ ) is an alternative due to the fact of the asymptotic freedom of strong interaction between quarks ( see reviews , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we then have to focus on astrophysical observations in order to solve this important and fundamental question",
    ".    actually , pulsars are ideal astro - laboratories for physics of cold matter at supranuclear density . based on the planck - like spectrum without atomic features and the precession properties of pulsar - like stars ,",
    "a solid quark matter conjecture was suggested @xcite .",
    "additionally , other features naturally explained within this model could possibly include sub - pulse drifting in radio emission @xcite , glitches @xcite , strong magnetic fields , birth after a successful core - collapse supernova , and detection of small bolometric radii ( for a short review , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "besides , the observational features of anomalous x - ray pulsars / soft gamma - ray repeaters may also reflect the nature of solid quark stars @xcite .    the slow glitches recently observed in psr b1822 - 09 @xcite could be a new probe into cold solid quark matter .",
    "the pulsar has a period of 0.769 s and a relative young age of 230 kyr .",
    "what is interesting in this pulsar is the change in its period known as slow glitches .",
    "different from the typical feature of glitch phenomenon of other pulsars , this pulsar shows glitches that have rather slow increase in spin frequency , with a time scale of 200 - 300 days ( while the normal glitches experience this process much swifter , maybe less than a spin period ) , and moreover , this pulsar did nt experience any relaxation progress during the post slow glitch days .",
    "a series of five slow glitches are shown in fig.1 .",
    "1(a ) shows the frequency derivative @xmath5 .",
    "the peaks of @xmath5 are enveloped in a parabolic curve , that may indicate that all the slow glitches could be the components of one process .",
    "this process could be triggered by the small glitch ( @xmath6 ) occurred in 1994 september . both fig .",
    "1 ( b ) and ( c ) show the frequency residual @xmath7 , but relative to fits to data for different intervals ( 1991 - 1994 for the former , and 1995 - 2004 for the latter ) . in this observational result , it is evident that the typical character of slow glitch in fig .",
    "1(b ) : the spin frequency experiences a process that increases gradually but never decreases ( i.e. no post - glitch relaxation there ) .     and frequency derivative @xmath8 for the pulsar b1822 - 09 .",
    "arrows pointing downwards indicate the epochs at which five slow glitches occurred , while arrows pointing upwards indicate two normal glitches .",
    "the figure is drawn by shabanova ( 2007 ) .",
    "[ r],width=288 ]    we are trying to explain this phenomenon in the regime of solid quark stars .",
    "since the pulsar is supposed to be mostly built up of solid quark matter and the typical density there is order of @xmath9 g/@xmath10 , soon after a quake , the motion of only a thin layer of the quark matter may cause significant change in the moment of inertia ( and thus the spin frequency ) of the star owing to the extremely high density .",
    "numerical calculation is carried out to simulate the observational results of both the slow increase in the rotating frequency and the lack of the relaxation of the post - glitch progress .",
    "we suggest that the star is a solid quark star with a typical density of @xmath9g/@xmath10 . due to magnetodipole radiation and particle ejection of the star , its rotation energy loses and frequency of the rotation declines .",
    "while on the other hand , provided that the pulsar cools down from a hotter fluid ellipse , the equilibrium of the pulsar , with spin frequency @xmath11 , results in an eccentricity of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , \\label{mac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the gravitational constant and @xmath15 is the averaged density of the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the configuration of eq.([mac ] ) is for spinning stars made up of homogenous fluid matter .",
    "quark stars could be well approximated by uniform density if their masses are not greater than @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "eq.([mac ] ) could be simplified for stars with small eccentricities as long as they spin not very fast , @xmath17    the relation of eq.([mac_simple ] ) implies that when the frequency of a star decreases , the eccentricity of the star should decrease accordingly in order to maintain the equilibrium shape if the star is in a fluid state .",
    "but , as the pulsar cools down and stays as solid star , the elastic stress might occur and accumulate to resist the changing of the star shape .",
    "when this stress develops to a critical value that the material of the star can not afford , part of the star breaks ( or _ collapses _ ) and then the elastic energy releases .",
    "this is known as a quake of solid quark star @xcite , during which both elastic and gravitational energies are released . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "the moment of inertia , @xmath18 , decreases suddenly ( to result in a sharp jump of @xmath7 ) , and then increases gradually ( to result in a following post - glitch relaxation ) .",
    "however , as elastic force develops to a critical value , a solid rotator with smaller shear modulus might not be so violent ( i.e. , @xmath18 does not decrease suddenly ) but in a gentle way for @xmath18 to decrease , and could thus reproduce the observational feature of slow glitches .",
    "no @xmath18-incensement occurs if no significant elastic energy is converted to kinematic energy ( and thus no post - glitch ) .",
    "the small glitch at 1994 of psr b1822 - 09 may lead to a small effective shear modulus ( e.g. , significant part of the quark matter would be shiver - like ) , and thus trigger the slow glitches . a pre - glitch could then be expected for slow glitches in the star - quake model of quark stars , in order to have an effective small shear modulus .    soon after a quake , we assume that a superficial layer moves in order to set a new equilibrium ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , while most of the inner part of star keeps almost the same .",
    "part of the energy released turns into heat and melts the debris , while the other part turns to the kinetic energy of the fluid .",
    "it is suggested in this model that the broken material will turn into viscous fluid and is therefore able to flow slowly and change the shape of the star towards the equilibrium shape .",
    "this progress would surely cause slow decreasing of the moment of inertia of the star .",
    "since this process happens in a pretty short time comparing to the typical age of the pulsar , it is reasonable to suppose that the angular momentum of the star keeps invariant during the whole progress of glitch . as a result",
    ", the frequency of the star might increase slowly during the same time .",
    "when the fluid is flowing , the viscous interaction among the elements of the fluid may exhaust the kinetic energy of the fluid .",
    "the shape of the star stop changing finally , and the material then cools down and is solidified .",
    "this is why slow glitch appears no relaxation feature in the post - glitch progress .",
    "calculational results ( see  3 ) explain why this pulsar experiences a serious of five slow glitches rather than a single one .     and @xmath18 versus time , respectively ( note : the usual change of @xmath11 and @xmath18 due to the energy lost by magnetodipole radiation and particle emission is neglected here ) .",
    "a slow glitch is supposed to occur at time @xmath19 . in the left , ( 1 ) an imagined ellipsoidal figure ( determined by eq.([mac ] ) ) at @xmath19 if the star is in a fluid state , with spin frequency @xmath20 ; ( 2 ) the real figure of a solid star at @xmath19 ( @xmath21 ) , with stress energy high enough to quake ; ( 3 ) the figure after slow glitch at time @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , which might be close to the imagined shape ( 1 ) ; ( 4 ) the inner solid part which keeps almost the same during a slow glitch ; ( 5 ) the superficial crust layer which is transmuted during the slow glitch progress . [ r],width=288 ]    to assure that model , we are doing numerical calculation to simulate this process .",
    "first , the navier - stokes equation is known as the basic equations to describe the motion of viscous fluid . in the frame which is fixed on the inner solid part of the star , the general form reads , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the velocity of the superficial matter in the rotating frame , @xmath26 is the pressure in the star",
    ", @xmath27 is the acceleration of gravity on the surface of the star , @xmath28 denotes the viscosity of the fluid after the phase transformation ( from solid to fluid - like matter ) , and the star is assumed to rotate constantly .",
    "the three terms in the bracket of right hand side arises from the inertial acceleration due to the non - inertial frame we choose .",
    "let s consider briefly eq.([navsto ] ) .",
    "for a zero order approximation , a solid star could be modelled by a rigidity body , with velocity @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 the above equation could at least be adaptable for the case of @xmath31 .",
    "observationally , the timescale of slow glitches is much longer than the spin period .",
    "we thus think that eq.([approx ] ) could be applied in our following simulation .",
    "when a glitch happens , the elastic energy is released suddenly , the solid superficial layer turns to a fluid - like state with strong viscosity , but the pressure gradient @xmath32 may keep to be almost invariant .",
    "it is a key point that @xmath32 remains approximately the same in spite of stress release in the model , which means that this is the case in which most of the elastic energy released is changed into heat , rather than into the kinetic energy .",
    "the heating may melt down solid quark matter to become viscous fluid .",
    "soon after the starquake , the matter could be re - solidified finally due to cooling .",
    "contrastively , in case that the star breaks globally , most of the elastic energy may turns into the form of the kinetic energy , and the pressure gradient would change significantly during starquake ; the star would experience then a normal glitch with sharp frequency increase .",
    "therefore , during a glitch , only * @xmath33 * and * v * in eq.([navsto ] ) change , with eq.([approx ] ) to be well approximated since @xmath34 and @xmath35 are very small . then eq.([navsto ] ) of the viscous fluid can be reduced to be @xmath36    we are concerning the initial and boundary conditions for our simulations .",
    "first we assume that only part of a solid quark star breaks under the stellar surface ( the shaded region in fig .",
    "2 ) , with a thickness of @xmath37 . we note that this assumption is for simplifying the calculation , but is not a key for general results in the starquake model for slow glitches ( see  3 ) .",
    "we denote @xmath38 to measure the height of matter in the beaked part , i.e. , @xmath39 in the bottom while @xmath40 on the surface .",
    "two cases are considered in the simulated result of fig .",
    "3 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the stellar radius .",
    "we suppose that the velocity of matter increases linearly from the bottom of collapsed layer to the top , with a boundary of zero velocity at the bottom , and that the velocity increases gradually from polar to equator . the tangential velocity could then be formulated as @xmath44 where * @xmath45 * is the maximum of the initial velocity soon after a quake .",
    "a starquake is assumed to be a trigger for the initial movement with maximum velocity @xmath46 .",
    "the continues condition of matter ( i.e. @xmath47 ) determines the radial velocity , given that the viscous fluid is incompressible .    solving eq.([dyna ] ) with boundary eq.([initial ] ) , one can obtain a 3-dimensional vector field of velocity all over the star . to achieve the changing of the shape and rotating frequency , we adopt the incompressible hypothesis and the conservation law of angular momentum .",
    "the movement of incompressible matter in the layer changes gradually the shape of star , and thus the angular frequency because of conservation of angular momentum .",
    "in fact the conservation law of angular momentum is not obeyed precisely due to the spindown torque . however , in light of the rather short duration of the glitch progress , the conservation could be well approximated during a relatively short time .    after a series of slow glitches , we may suppose that the star stays at an equilibrium state which is described by eq.([mac_simple ] ) .",
    "it is worth clarifying that , as noted in fig .",
    "2 ( note the difference between states ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) ) , after each slow glitch ( except the last one ) , the star did not turn to the real equilibrium state , but suffer actually a series of glitches , not only a single one .",
    "we can then obtain the eccentricity of the star with the angular frequency at the end of the five slow glitches through eq.([mac_simple ] ) . after doing that",
    ", we may calculate the star s spin frequency in any time via the conservation law of angular momentum . getting all above",
    ", we can carry out numerical calculus after setting the value of initial velocity * @xmath45 * and viscosity @xmath28 .",
    "our goal is to find whether there is reasonable parameter space ( of * @xmath45 * and @xmath28 ) where the general features of the slow glitches observed could be reproduced . in the calculation , the `` heun '' method is adopted in order to obtain more accurate values from numerical calculations .",
    "we do the simulation with typical density of @xmath48 g/@xmath10 and stellar radius of @xmath49 km for indications . however ,",
    "according to various simulations , the general conclusions would not change significantly if these two parameters are in the same orders .",
    "observational data of slow glitches and the simulated result in the solid quark star model are shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "3 , respectively .",
    "the parameters of @xmath28 and @xmath45 for the five slow glitches are also shown in table 1 .    in fig .",
    "3 , two simulated curves are shown with different thickness of the surface fluid layer , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . from fig .",
    "3 , it is obvious that the thickness indeed affect the result of @xmath7 .",
    "though the general behavior keeps , the amplitude and the gradient of @xmath7 increase as percentage of the thickness to the stellar radius increases .",
    "( in unit of @xmath52 hz ) , and the horizontal axis measures the time ( in days ) .",
    "the two curvatures in this figure are two simulations , given that the thickness of the surface layer to be @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",

    "5 , respectively .    as shown in fig .",
    "4 , where values of @xmath28 are the same listed in table 1 , @xmath7-curves for various @xmath45 are illustrated .",
    "it is evident that a larger value of @xmath45 could result in a larger glitch amplitude of @xmath7 .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the time durations in which @xmath7 increases to the maximum are almost the same .",
    "this could be easily understood since a larger @xmath45 implies a larger stress and energy released in the starquake .",
    "the effect of changing @xmath28-values on the amplitude of @xmath7 are demonstrated in fig . 5 , where the values of @xmath45 are the same listed in table 1 . as shown in fig . 5 , smaller @xmath28-values could not only result in higher amplitudes of @xmath7 , but also in longer durations for @xmath7 to increase to maximum .",
    "this result is also understandable . in the model , the fluid moves under coriolis force and viscous resistance .",
    "smaller @xmath28 could lead to a relative smaller resistance and thus a longer time to reach its equilibrium . in summary",
    ", one needs to have a high @xmath46 or a low @xmath28 in order to reproduce a large amplitude of @xmath7 , while a small @xmath11-value could effectively delay the increase of @xmath7 .     with different parameters of @xmath45 .",

    "a solid quark star model , in which the surface matter breaks during an initial small glitch , is suggested for understanding the general features of slow glitches observed recently .",
    "though this is a real problem of rheology in principle , we deal with the matter as viscous fluid for simplicity .",
    "numerical calculations show that the observed slow glitches could be reproduced if the effective coefficient of viscosity is @xmath0 @xmath1s@xmath2 and the initial velocity of the superficial layer is order of @xmath3 @xmath4s@xmath2 in the coordinate rotating frame of the star .",
    "we simulated with typical density of @xmath48 g/@xmath10 and stellar radius of @xmath49 km for indications , but the general conclusions would not change significantly if these two parameters are in the same orders .",
    "the pieces of blocks should be re - correlated through solidifying melted surfaces of the pieces , into which the superficial layer of a solid quark star breaks soon after a quake . the released energy ( both gravitational and elastic ) during a slow glitch may result in melting the conjunctional parts of segments ( i.e. , the surfaces of blocks ) at first .",
    "the temperature then increases significantly at only a small fraction ( @xmath68 ) of the segments . for an order - of - magnitude demonstration",
    ", we apply the debye model to normal solid quark matter and obtain a heat capacity of @xmath69 the matter absorbs an energy of @xmath70 from an initial temperature of @xmath71 to @xmath72 . in case of released energy of @xmath73 erg and a melting temperature of @xmath74 mev ( @xmath75",

    "we note the timescale for keeping such a high temperature gradient should be very small , so that the contacting parts cool rapidly to solidify .",
    "more and more small blocks become correlated ( i.e. , a big solid - like bulk matter forms ) as a slow glitch evolves , and strain energy develops again then .",
    "all the heated points are within the star and the cold surface keeps , and then no significant heating feature could be observed after a glitch .",
    "alternatively , let s consider a crusted strange quark star with a solid crust and a fluid quark matter core .",
    "the inertia of the crust could be only @xmath82 times of that of the quark matter core . according to @xmath83 for slow glitches ,",
    "the crust ellipticity should change a value of @xmath84 , while the actual ellipticity is @xmath82 for stars with period of @xmath85 s. this means that pulsar slow glitches could not be re - produced in a crusted strange star model .",
    "what is the key ingredient which affects a pulsar to undergo a normal or a slow glitch ?",
    "we think that the stellar mass of quark star could play an important role in this issue .",
    "let s introduce two kinds of stress force inside solid stars at first .",
    "as noted by @xcite , two kinds of factors could result in the development of stress energy in a solid star , and then in star quakes as glitches .",
    "( i ) as a quark star cools ( even spinning constantly ) , changing state of matter may cause a development of anisotropic pressure distributed inside a solid matter .",
    "such matter can not be well approximated by perfect fluid , and the equation governing star s gravitational equilibrium should then not be the tov equation . in case of spherical symmetry ( the simplest case )",
    ", one can introduce the difference between radial and tangential pressures , @xmath86 .",
    "change of @xmath86 would lead to no - conservation of stellar volume .",
    "we call the force , which acts primary in this case , as _ bulk - variable force_. this kind of force may be the key factor for giant quakes during superflares of soft @xmath87-ray repeaters @xcite .",
    "( ii ) an uniform fluid star would keep its eccentricity presented in eq.([mac ] ) or eq.([mac_simple ] ) , i.e. , the eccentricity decreases as a star spins down .",
    "however , for a solid star , the shear stress would prevent the star from decreasing eccentricity during spindown . in this case",
    ", even the state of matter does not change , stress energy could still develop as solid star spins down .",
    "we call this kind of force as _ bulk - invariable force _ since the total stellar volume may always keep constantly .",
    "starquakes due to bulk - invariable force , and the consequent glitches , were calculated and discussed in @xcite .",
    "both bulk - invariable and bulk - variable forces could result in decreases of moment of inertia , and therefore in pulsar glitches .",
    "these two kinds of forces could trigger normal glitches if they are relatively stronger than the critical stress , but might only conduce to slow glitches if weaker",
    ". the bulk - variable force could be stronger than the bulk - invariable one for massive solid stars , since , in a special case of non - rotating , the gravity @xmath88 ( @xmath89 : mass , @xmath43 : radius ) is strong there",
    ". if the critical stress of solid quark matter is almost the same ( note : the effective critical stress could be much small for a shiver - like surface layer ) , we may think that normal glitches prefer to occur in massive quark stars with possibly strong bulk - variable forces , while slow glitches are likely to take place in low - mass solid quark stars .",
    "what if psr b1822 - 09 is a low - mass quark star ?",
    "the spindown due to magnetodipole torque for a star with a magnetic dipole moment @xmath28 , a moment of inertia @xmath18 , and an angular velocity @xmath90 reads @xmath91 this rule keeps quantitatively for any oblique rotators , as long as the braking torques due to magnetodipole radiation and the unipolar generator are combined @xcite .",
