    "they observed that two young patients had exceptionally high non censored los and , as a consequence , the ml estimator yielded an unexpected large estimate of the interaction @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , they proposed the use of a robust parametric procedure called `` weighted maximum likelihood '' ( wml / g ) based on the gaussian error model ( that performed better than log - weibull ) .",
    "they compared wml / g with other published robust procedures an found that the robust estimates of @xmath81 were close to zero .    here , we assume a glg error model and consider the ml , 1tml , 2tml , 1swl and 2swl regression estimates reported in table [ tabexamci ] .",
    "estimated regression lines are reported in figure [ figexamci ] as well .",
    "for comparison , we also report the ml estimate with gaussian errors ( ml / g ) and wml / gauss .",

    "this observation is supported by the plots in figure [ figexamcifhat ] , where three types of distributions of the standardized residuals are displayed : km , parametric ( normal and glg ) , and semiparametric ( normal and glg ) .",
    "note the very large steps of km corresponding to the two extreme non censored observations .",
    "the reason is that km puts the mass of several censored residuals on these two points .",

    "both wml / gauss and 2tml distribution functions behave much better : with two exceptions , their residuals follow the models very well .",

    "finally , we note that the use of glg provides a reasonable fit for the two young patients with high non censored los , while the censored observations corresponding to emergency admission in the right bottom corner are considered outliers .",

    "clearly , the outliers ( those with weights equals to zero in 2tml are marked with crosses in figure [ figexambi ] ) have an important leverage effect on the ml coefficients and shape parameter . removing the outliers",
    ", ml becomes similar to the robust estimates . in practice",
    ", this simple analysis suggests that the possibility of splitting this particular drg into two groups should be further investigated .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the glg model is a very flexible family of distributions which is used to describe asymmetrically distributed data in many real applications . in this paper , we considered estimators which are simultaneously robust and efficient for aft models , when the errors follow a glg distribution and the data may contain censored observations .",
    "the estimation procedures have two main components : an initial highly robust but not necessarily efficient estimator and a final efficient estimator which starts with the initial one .",
    "we first considered the case , where no covariables are present and , in this case , we proposed an initial estimator that minimizes a @xmath0 scale of the differences between theoretical an empirical quantiles of order smaller than @xmath346 , where @xmath115 is a trimming fraction .",
    "the final estimator is a one step weighted likelihood estimator , where the weights penalizing the outliers are derived from the initial estimator .    for the case , where covariables are present ,",
    "the proposed estimators were derived in three steps . in a first step we used a regression mm - estimator as proposed in @xcite to obtain initial slope estimates and to compute the corresponding residuals . in a second step , we computed an initial estimator of the glg parameters by applying the procedure for the no covariables case to these residuals . in the third step we obtained a final estimator of all the parameters using a one step truncated ml starting with the initial estimator .",
