    "ever since beckenstein s suggestion @xcite that the area of the event horizon of a black hole is proportional to its physical entropy , the relationship between a configuration of the gravitational field and its thermodynamic disorder has provided fertile ground for research .",
    "when combined with hawking s demonstration @xcite that black holes can radiate with a blackbody spectrum at non - zero temperature ( once quantum effects are taken into account ) , the correspondence between black hole physics and equilibrium thermodynamics becomes particularly robust . despite this , the origin of black hole entropy in terms of an underlying microphysical explanation remains inconclusive , though a number of intriguing suggestions from both string theory and loop quantum gravity have appeared in recent years .",
    "gravitational entropy can be regarded as arising from the gibbs - duhem relation applied to the path - integral formulation of quantum gravity .",
    "while such a formulation is undoubtedly not the last word on this subject , at least in the semiclassical limit it should yield a relationship between gravitational entropy and other relevant thermodynamic quantities .  in employing this relation , hawking and hunter",
    "@xcite proposed that gravitational entropy arises whenever it is not possible to foliate a given spacetime in the euclidean regime by a family of surfaces of constant time .",
    "this situation can occur in @xmath8-dimensions if the topology of the euclidean spacetime is not trivial  specifically when the ( euclidean ) timelike killing vector @xmath9  that generates the u(1 ) isometry group has a fixed point set of even co - dimension .",
    "if this co - dimension is @xmath10 then the usual relationship between area and entropy holds .",
    "however if the co - dimension is smaller than this the relationship between area and entropy is generalized .",
    "such situations occur in spacetimes containing nut - charges .  in four dimensions they not only can have @xmath11-dimensional fixed point sets ( called `` bolts '' )",
    ", they also have @xmath12-dimensional fixed point sets ( called `` nuts '' ) .  here",
    "the orbits of the @xmath13 isometry group develop singularities , of dimension 1 in the orbit space , and of dimension @xmath11 in the euclidean spacetime .",
    "these singularities are the gravitational analogues of dirac string singularities and are referred to as misner strings .",
    "when the nut charge is nonzero , the entropy of a given spacetime includes not only the entropies of the @xmath11-dimensional bolts , but also those of the misner strings .    in @xmath14 dimensions the resulting quantities are finite although the different contributions typically diverge with the size of the system , due to the fact that the solutions are not asymptotically flat but asymptotically locally anti de sitter .",
    "these divergences have been addressed within the framework for conserved quantities and entropy due to brown - york ( see @xcite ) by computing the quantities relative to a background spacetime of appropriate topology ; for example a bolt - spacetime relative to a nut - spacetime @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14-dimensional case has also been addressed in terms of nther s theorem ( see refs . @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "provided that a background is introduced , conserved quantities are considered as quantities relative to the background , and the covariant first order lagrangian is used ( see @xcite ) . in this framework the entropy is defined _  la _ clausius as the quantity that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics . in later work the relationship between nther currents of the covariant first order lagrangian and the brown - york framework was analyzed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has also been shown that such quantities can be computed intrinsically , without reference to a background , for both non - rotating mannmisner and rotating @xcite cases .",
    "this can be done for asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) nut - charged spacetimes by employing the ads / cft - inspired counterterm approach @xcite ,  and for their asymptotically flat counterparts via a suitable generalization of this scheme @xcite .",
    "the resultant thermodynamic behaviour has some surprising features .",
    "although the entropy can be intrinsically computed it is no longer positive definite for all possible values of the nut charge .",
    "instead there exists a finite range of values for the nut charge for which the entropy and specific heat are both positive ; outside of this range at least one of these quantities is negative .",
    "this occurs for both non - rotating @xcite and rotating @xcite solutions .    motivated by these unusual results , we consider in this paper an analysis of the thermodynamic behaviour of higher  dimensional nut  charged spacetimes .",
    "these spacetimes were first considered by bais and batenberg @xcite in the asymptotically flat case , and then generalized to asymptotically ads situations by awad and chamblin @xcite . despite the fact that the two methods based on the nther theorem and the counterterm approach share _ a priori _ very few features , we show they provide the same results .  an off - shell comparison between these two approaches will be postponed to a future paper .",
    "we compute the action , conserved mass and thermodynamic quantities for taub - nut - ads and taub - bolt - ads spacetimes in six , eight and ten dimensions , and consider the general properties of the @xmath0-dimensional case .",
    "we find the qualitative thermodynamic properties of nut - charged spacetimes alternate between dimensionalities of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "for example all of the six - dimensional quantities have an overall negative sign to their four dimensional counterparts , whereas those in eight dimensions have the same overall sign .",
    "the bolt cases do not share this property .",
    "we then extend our study to the general @xmath0-dimensional case , and find general expressions for the action , the conserved mass , the entropy and the specific heat for the nut and bolt cases .",
    "for later convenience we briefly summarize the nther and counterterm approaches ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .",
    "the nther framework is based on the covariant first order lagrangian @xmath15\\>\\hbox{d}s   \\label{fol}\\]]where @xmath16 is the dynamical metric , @xmath17 is the background , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the scalar curvatures of the metric and the background respectively , @xmath20 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath21 is a tensorial quantity defined by @xmath22the constant @xmath23 depends on unit conventions and it becomes relevant when coupling to matter fields . in this paper",
    "we shall set @xmath24 .",
    "we remark that the lagrangian ( [ fol ] ) is the sum of three terms @xmath25 each of which is a covariant lagrangian on its own .",
    "hence in a geometrical well - defined way , the total conserved quantities @xmath26 associated with the total lagrangian @xmath27 will split as @xmath28 , each term being associated to a partial lagrangian @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "we also remark that @xmath32 is the standard local volume element associated with the coordinates used on the spacetime @xmath33 of dimension @xmath34 .",
    "the equality @xmath35 holds .",
    "the double notation is maintained for coherence with the quoted references .",
    "the nther theorem , when applied to this lagrangian , has proved to be effective in solving the anomalous factor problems @xcite known for the komar potential ( see @xcite ) . by choosing a suitable background",
    "it has been shown to be effective in the case of non - asymptotically flat solutions generalizing the standard adm conserved quantities .",
    "the conserved quantities are defined as the integral of the following superpotential @xmath36\\>\\hbox{d}s_{\\alpha \\beta } \\label{superpotential}\\]]for any spacetime vector field @xmath37 .",
    "we remark that this superpotential inherits a splitting @xmath38 from the splitting of the lagrangian , i.e. @xmath39by specifying @xmath37 the energy - momentum and the angular momentum of the spacetime with metric @xmath40 relative to the background metric @xmath41 are obtained . here",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are the covariant derivatives with respect to the dynamical metric and the background respectively .",
    "the superpotential @xmath44 ( computed along the dynamical and the background metric ) defines the conserved current ( relative to the background @xmath45 ) within a closed @xmath1-dimensional submanifold @xmath46 of spacetime @xmath47    in the limit that @xmath46 bounds a leaf of the foliation of the full spacetime ( e.g. @xmath48 in minkowski ) one obtains the global conserved quantities @xmath49 . for a fixed adm slicing a time translation generates the mass @xmath33 while an asymptotic rotation generates the angular momentum . by imposing suitable boundary conditions one can also define the conserved quantity in a finite spacelike region ourbrownyork .",
    "the entropy is defined when the relevant thermodynamic potentials are provided .",
    "in particular the temperature @xmath50 has to be provided by some other physical means ( e.g. from the radiation spectrum of a black hole ) . in general the momenta conjugate to the angular momentum and the other ( gauge )",
    "charges have to be provided as well . for taub - bolt ( nut )",
    "solutions the ( inverse ) temperature is identified with the period of the euclidean time , chosen so that the euclidean manifold is regular at all degeneracies of the foliation .    for a family of solutions of the taub - bolt type described below , the first law of thermodynamics is of the following form @xmath51 from which we can obtain the entropy @xmath52 by integration .",
    "this method , introduced in @xcite and generalized in @xcite , proved to be effective in many situations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "notice that since the entropy is obtained as an integral quantity , in this context it is defined modulo a constant not depending on the solution under investigation but possibly depending on the model ( e.g. on the cosmological constant ) .",
    "turning next to the counterterm approach we modify the above action in @xmath34 dimensions to be @xmath53where @xmath54and @xmath55 is the lagrangian for matter fields @xmath56 .",
    "the first term in ( [ action ] ) is the bulk action over the @xmath34 dimensional manifold @xmath57 with metric @xmath58 and the second term ( [ actbound ] ) is a surface term necessary to ensure that the euler - lagrange variation is well - defined , yielding the einstein equations of motion with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the boundary @xmath59 ( with induced metric @xmath60 ) of the manifold in general consists of both spacelike and timelike hypersurfaces .  for an asymptotically ads",
    "spacetime it will be the einstein cylinder at infinity ; for an asymptotically ds spacetime it will be the union of spatial euclidean boundaries at early and late times .",

    "this conjecture has been verified for several important examples , encouraging the expectation that an understanding of quantum gravity in a given spacetime ( at least an asymptotically ads one ) can be obtained by studying its holographic cft dual , defined on the boundary of spacetime at infinity .",
    "the boundary counterterm action @xmath61 arises from the counterterms of the cft .",
    "it is universal , depending only on curvature invariants that are functionals of the intrinsic boundary geometry , leaving the equations of motion unchanged . by rewriting the einstein equations in gauss - codacci form , and then solving them in terms of the extrinsic curvature functional of the boundary @xmath59 and its normal derivatives to obtain the divergent parts @xcite , it can be generated by an algorithmic procedure .",
    "the entire divergent structure can be covariantly isolated for any given boundary dimension @xmath69 , since all divergent parts can be expressed in terms of intrinsic boundary data and do not depend on normal derivatives feffgraham . by varying the boundary metric under a weyl transformation , it can be shown that the trace @xmath70 of the extrinsic curvature is proportional to the divergent boundary counterterm lagrangian .",

    "details of this formulation can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we can proceed further by formulating gravitational thermodynamics via the euclidean path integral @xmath91 d\\left [ \\psi \\right ] e^{-i\\left [ g,\\psi \\right ] } \\simeq e^{-i_{{cl } } }   \\label{zpath}\\]]where one integrates over all metrics and matter fields between some given initial and final euclidean hypersurfaces , taking @xmath84 to have some period @xmath92 , determined by demanding regularity of the euclideanized manifold at degenerate points of the foliation .",
    "semiclassically the result is given by the classical action evaluated on the equations of motion , and yields to this order @xmath93upon application of the gibbs - duhem relation to the partition function .",

    "note that in this approach there is no freedom to shift the value of the entropy by a constant .",
    "we shall find in the sequel that all bolt ads - spacetimes have an additional constant independent of the nut charge .",
    "this constant has no effect on the first law of thermodynamics ( in which only changes of entropy are observable ) ; its physical value is such that the entropy vanishes for the ground state ( vanishing nut charge ) .    in the sequel",
    "we shall analyze the conservation laws of taub - nut / bolt solutions in dimension @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , both by nther theorem and counterterm methods .",
    "we stress that there is no _ a priori _ reason for these methods to provide the same results , though , as we shall see , in this case the methods completely agree .",
    "the entropy is computed , both by the gibbs - duhem relation and by the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "these two methods provide two expressions for the entropy which are in agreement apart from the aforementioned integration constant .",
    "we begin by briefly recapitulating the results from four dimensions mannmisner , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the metric is given by @xmath100 with @xmath101 the general action was found to be @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the period of @xmath84 , given in four dimensions by @xmath104and determined by demanding regularity of the manifold so that the singularities at @xmath105 are coordinate artifacts .",
    "there is an additional regularity criterion to be satisfied , namely the absence of conical singularities at the roots of the function @xmath106 .",
    "this can be ensured by demanding that the period of of @xmath84 is @xmath107 where @xmath108 , and the second equality follows by demanding consistency with eq .",
    "( [ bet4 ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that there are only two solutions to eq .",
    "( [ bet4a ] ) , one where @xmath109 and one where @xmath110 , referred to respectively as the nut and bolt solutions . in the former case",
    "we have @xmath111whereas solving ( [ bet4a ] ) in this latter case gives two possible solutions @xmath112 with the limit on @xmath113 being @xmath114 since we want the discriminant to be real .",
    "the actions can be calculated for these two solutions , using the nut and bolt masses ( found by solving @xmath115 for @xmath116 and @xmath117 for @xmath118 ; see tables [ summarytablenut ] , [ summarytablebolt ] at the end of the paper ) .",
    "the actions in four dimensions are @xmath119 the entropy and specific heat for the nut and bolt solutions have also been calculated @xcite , @xcite : @xmath120 note that that the entropy becomes negative for @xmath121 @xcite and the specific heat negative for @xmath122 .",
    "thus , for thermally stable solutions , the value of the nut charge must be in the range @xmath123 for the bolt , the entropy and specific heat are found to be @xmath124 where we recall in @xmath125that @xmath126 ; @xmath127 has been given explicitly for each @xmath128 .",
    "a plot of the entropy and specific heat vs. @xmath129 indicates that the upper branch solutions ( @xmath130 ) are thermally stable , whereas the lower branch solutions ( @xmath131 ) are thermally unstable .",
    "as these plots are qualitatively similar to the six - dimensional case ( see figures [ 6dscboltplot ] , [ 6dsbmplot ] , 6dcbmplot ) , we shall not reproduce them here .",
    "the analysis via nther theorem was carried out assuming no cosmological constant ( see @xcite ) . here",
    "we shall generalize to the case of non - zero cosmological case .",
    "we set @xmath132 and we compute the relative energy between taub - bolt and taub - nut solution within the spatial sphere @xmath133 .",
    "we obtain @xmath134 where @xmath135 the total relative energy in the limit @xmath136 is @xmath137 hence we have @xmath138 and no angular momentum , as expected .",
    "assuming the temperature @xmath139 the resulting entropy is @xmath140    hence , comparing to the results above , we obtain @xmath141 hence the same classical entropy is obtained by the two methods up to an integration constant .",
    "in six dimensions , there are two possible forms of the metric ( as given by @xcite ) .",
    "one form uses @xmath142 as a base space , and has the following form ; @xmath143 the second form uses @xmath144 as a base space , and generalizes the metric to include a negative cosmological constant .",
    "it has the form , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the metric for the @xmath147 space , with the form @xmath148 and the one - form @xmath149 is given by @xmath150    both forms of the metric use the same form for @xmath106 , given in six dimensions by @xmath151 and yield exactly the same action and and total mass , the only difference between the calculations being that each base space has a different volume element associated with it .",
    "using the method of counter - terms , before specializing to nut or bolt solutions , the action is found to be @xmath152 with @xmath153 the value of @xmath154 that is the largest positive root of @xmath155 , determined by the fixed point set of @xmath156 .",

    "this implies @xmath169 , yielding  @xcite @xmath170for the mass parameter .",

    "it can also be seen in this plot that the high temperature limits ( @xmath180 ) of the entropy and specific heat are zero ; the action also goes to zero in this limit .     in 6 dimensions ]    finally , in the flat space limit as @xmath181 , the action , entropy and specific heat become @xmath182again indicating that asymptotically locally flat spacetimes with nut charge in six dimensions are thermodynamically unstable for all values of @xmath113 .      in the case of the bolt solution , we require that the fixed points of @xmath156 be @xmath14-dimensional , implying @xmath110 and @xmath183 the conditions @xcite for a regular bolt solution are ( i ) @xmath184 and ( ii ) @xmath185 . from ( ii ) , @xmath186 is @xmath187 where reality requirements imply @xmath188 since @xmath189 .",
