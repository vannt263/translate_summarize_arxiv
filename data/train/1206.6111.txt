    "we assign degree @xmath12 to each variable @xmath13 , then the isomorphism divides the degrees in half ( the left hand side only has even degree elements ) .    among the many works inspired by @xcite , gullemin and zara @xcite studied the combinatorial properties of @xmath14 , and showed that many familiar theorems in geometry , such as the abbv localization theorem , are in fact theorems about graphs . in other words",
    ", they proved some theorems in graph theory inspired by the well - known geometric facts . in this paper , we consider the problem in the opposite direction : can we find new properties of gkm manifolds , which have no known geometric proof , by studying the properties of the graphs ?",
    "we are interested in the case when @xmath3 is a symplectic manifold and @xmath15 is a hamiltonian action ( we refer the reader to @xcite for definitions of basic notions in symplectic geometry ) .",
    "we will call @xmath3 a _ hamiltonian gkm manifold _ if it is a symplectic manifold with a hamiltonian torus action that is gkm .",
    "the manifold is always assumed to be compact . in this case",

    "we note that when @xmath11 is actually the gkm graph of a manifold , then these three notions : characteristic numbers , combinatorial betti numbers and geometric betti numbers all agree .",
    "these @xmath52 s were used as the combinatorial counterpart of geometric betti numbers in @xcite .",
    "they do have some nice properties that resemble the geometric ones .",
    "for example , poincare duality holds .",
    "but there are certain shortfalls .",
    "first of all , they are well - defined only for very restrictive graphs : regular graphs with axial functions .",
    "this makes inductive arguments difficult .",
    "second of all , for a connected regular graph equipped with an axial function , one would expect the zeroth betti number to be @xmath12 , but this is not the case , as the following simple example shows .",

    "the arrow points in the @xmath51 direction and the number beside a vertex indicates the index of the that vertex .",
    "we can see although poincare duality still holds , the graph has an undesirable @xmath53 , which is @xmath54 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath41 s are defined in a much more general setting and @xmath55 equals to the number of connected components of the graph .",
    "these properties provide the first motivation for studying these numbers . in section",
    "[ sec : characteristic ] , we study the basic properties of characteristic numbers .",
    "we will see how they resemble , or fail to resemble , the geometric betti numbers in various senses . in the remaining two sections , we study the properties of actual gkm graphs , i.e. , graphs that are in fact the gkm graphs of compact hamiltonian gkm manifolds . in section",
    "[ sec : connectivity ] , using our tools of characteristic numbers and the fact that top betti number of a compact oriented manifold is @xmath12 , we deduce some connectivity properties of ( actual ) gkm graphs , under the assumption that the moment map is in general position . the main theorems are theorem  [ theorem : edge connected ] and theorem  [ theorem : vertex connected ] .",
    "section  [ sec : bound ] is largely motivated by the following question :    suppose that a symplectic manifold @xmath56 admits a hamiltonian @xmath57 action with isolated fixed points .",
    "does @xmath56 satisfy the hard lefschetz property ?",
    "yael karshon brought up the question at a workshop at birs in 2005 and is listed as problem 4.2 in @xcite .",
    "the problem was said to have existed for over ten years before then , but the origin of it is unclear .",
    "susan tolman pointed out an easier version of the question .",
    "[ question : tolman ] suppose that a symplectic manifold @xmath56 of dimension @xmath58 admits a hamiltonian @xmath57 action with isolated fixed points .",

    "as we have already stated , these manifolds have the virtue that their equivarant cohomology , and hence ordinary cohomology , can be computed combinatorially as graph cohomology .",
    "moreover , all the odd betti numbers of these manifolds vanish , so we only need to worry about the even betti numbers when considering tolman s question .    using the tools and results we will develop in section  [ sec : characteristic ] and  [ sec : connectivity ] , we prove in section  [ sec : bound ] an upper bound for @xmath64 of hamiltonian gkm manifold whose moment map is in general position .",
    "this is the content of theorem  [ thm : bound ] . in dimension @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", this will imply that the betti numbers of these manifolds are unimodal .",
    "so our work provides a class of examples which suggests a framework for a positive answer to karshon s and tolman s questions .",
