    "details of the nature of the astrophysical @xmath0 process @xcite producing the rare , proton - rich , stable isotopes of elements beyond ni still remain elusive .",
    "it has been shown that such proton - rich isotopes can be produced by photodisintegrations in massive stars @xcite , involving ( @xmath2,n ) , ( @xmath2,p ) , and ( @xmath2,@xmath7 ) reactions at stellar temperatures exceeding 10@xmath8 k. depending on intricate details of the stellar structure and evolution , @xmath0 nuclides are mostly produced in the final explosion of a massive star ( @xmath9 ) as a core - collapse supernova or in pre - explosive oxygen burning episodes @xcite . despite the fact that @xmath0 nuclei can be produced consistently with solar ratios over a wide range of nuclei in such scenarios , there remain deficiencies in a few regions , for mass numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the problem is especially pronounced in the mo - ru region where the @xmath0 isotopes are strongly underproduced .",
    "this fact motivates the search for alternative or additional ways to produce these nuclides .",
    "proton capture and photodisintegration processes in exploding carbon - oxygen white dwarfs have been suggested as a source @xcite , or thermonuclear explosions in the proton - rich layer accreted on the surface of a neutron star in a binary system with mass flow from the main - sequence companion star @xcite .",
    "common to all approaches is that the modelling requires a large network of hundreds of nuclear reactions involving stable nuclei as well as unstable , proton - rich nuclides .",
    "it is well known that ( @xmath2,@xmath7 ) reactions are important at higher masses , whereas ( @xmath2,p ) or proton capture is important for the production of the less massive @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "the relevant astrophysical reaction rates calculated from the cross sections are inputs to this network , therefore their knowledge is essential for @xmath0 process calculations . while there are compilations of neutron capture data along the line of stability , there are still very few charged - particle cross sections determined experimentally @xcite , despite big experimental efforts in recent years .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 process rates involving charged projectiles are still based mainly on ( largely untested ) theoretical cross sections obtained from hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations .",
    "the aim of our systematic study is to contribute to the existing database of measured cross sections relevant to the astrophysical @xmath0 process , and to check the reliability of the statistical model calculations over an extensive set of nuclides . this way the uncertainties in the @xmath0 process abundance calculations arising from nuclear physics input can be constrained .    in this paper",
    "we present measurements of the @xmath5se(p,@xmath2)@xmath6br , @xmath12se(p,@xmath2)@xmath13br , and @xmath4se(p , n)@xmath4br reactions in the astrophysically relevant energy range using an activation technique .",
    "the two proton capture reactions and their inverses are directly playing a role in the synthesis of @xmath5se , whereas the ( p , n ) reaction can be used as a further test of statistical model calculations . the choice of these reactions is further elaborated in sec .",
    "[ sec : reacs ] and the experimental method is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : expmethod ] .",
    "the resulting cross sections and astrophysical @xmath14 factors ( given in sec .",
    "[ sec : expres ] ) are compared with results obtained with the two hauser - feshbach statistical model codes non - smoker @xcite and most @xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] .",
    "both codes are based on the statistical theory of hauser and feshbach @xcite but use different models for the nuclear ingredients of the calculations . by using both codes we are able to investigate the effects of a broader range of nuclear level densities and optical model potentials .",
    "the astrophysical reaction rates derived from our new experimental data are given in the concluding sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "the element se has six stable isotopes with mass numbers @xmath15 , 76 , 77 , 78 , 80 and 82 having isotopic abundances of 0.89% , 9.36% , 7.63% , 23.78% , 49.61% and 8.73% , respectively .",
    "proton capture reactions on these isotopes lead to br isotopes among which @xmath16br and @xmath17br are stable .",
    "therefore the cross sections of the @xmath18se(p,@xmath2)@xmath19br reactions can not be measured using an activation technique .",
    "the half life of @xmath20br , i.e.  the reaction product of @xmath13se(p,@xmath2)@xmath20br , is too short ( t@xmath21  =  6.49  min . ) for our experimental method ( see experimental details ) .",
    "thus the aim of the measurement was to determine the proton capture cross section of three reactions : @xmath22se(p,@xmath2)@xmath23br .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath4se the ( p , n ) channel opens already at @xmath24  =  891  kev and , therefore , competes strongly with the ( p,@xmath2 ) reaction in the whole energy range investigated in the present work .",
    "moreover , the strongest @xmath2 transition following the @xmath25 decay of @xmath26br has a very low relative intensity ( only 1.2% of the decays lead to the emission of this 529.6kev @xmath2-ray ) .",
    "the latter two facts made it impossible to observe the decay of @xmath26br and to measure the @xmath4se(p,@xmath2)@xmath26br cross section .",
    "however , the @xmath4se(p , n)@xmath4br cross section could be determined .    in summary ,",
    "the cross sections of three reactions have been measured : @xmath1se(p,@xmath2)@xmath3br , and @xmath4se(p , n)@xmath4br .",
    "the astrophysically relevant energy range ( gamow  window ) for these reactions in the temperature range from t=1.8@xmath27k to 3.3@xmath27k spans from 1.25 to 3.87mev .",
    "this energy region was covered by the experiment .",
    "the relevant part of the chart of nuclides can be seen in fig .",
    "[ nuclide ] where the proton induced reactions and the decay of the reaction products can also be seen .",
    "the decay parameters used for the analysis are summarized in table [ decay ] .",
