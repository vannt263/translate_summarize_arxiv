    "kleene algebra ( @xmath1 ) arises in many areas of computer science , such as automata theory , the design and analysis of algorithms , dynamic logic , and program semantics .",
    "many of these applications are enhanced by using kleene algebra with tests ( @xmath2 ) , which combines @xmath1  with boolean algebra .",
    "we can use @xmath2  to reason propositionally about programs ( see @xcite for examples ) .",
    "the equivalence of an optimized and unoptimized program , the equivalence of an annotated and unannotated program , and partial correctness assertions can all be expressed as equations . the equational theory of @xmath2  is well understood and has many useful properties ; in particular , it is decidable ( in _ pspace _ ) and the theory remains unchanged when we restrict to relational interpretations @xcite .",
    "( relational interpretations are of the greatest interest because the intended semantics are generally relational . )",
    "however , we frequently wish to reason about programs under certain assumptions about the interaction of atomic programs and tests . for example , if @xmath3 is the program `` x : = 0 '' and @xmath4 is the assertion `` x = 0 '' , then we want to be able to make use of the facts @xmath5 ( `` after running @xmath3 , test @xmath4 always succeeds '' ) and @xmath6 ( `` after test @xmath4 succeeds , @xmath3 is redundant '' ) when reasoning about programs in which @xmath3 and @xmath4 appear ; for instance , the equation @xmath7 is not valid in @xmath2 , but the formula @xmath8 is .",
    "thus , the _ universal horn theory _ is of interest .",
    "universal horn formula _ is an implication @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a finite set of equations .",
    "the word `` universal '' refers to the fact that the atomic symbols of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are implicitly universally quantified .",
    "universal horn theory _ of a class of structures @xmath13 , denoted @xmath14 , is the set of universal horn formulas valid under all interpretations over structures in @xmath13 .",
    "the increased generality of the universal horn theory is accompanied by greater complexity , and the theory does not remain the same when we restrict to important classes of kleene algebras such as @xmath15-continuous kleene algebras with tests ( @xmath16 ) and relational kleene algebras with tests ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath18 is @xmath19-complete ( undecidable ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath22-complete ( highly undecidable ) , and we have proper inclusions @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "although these horn theories are very complex in general , there are fragments of them that are both practical and of lower complexity",
    ". consider the following theorem , fundamentally due to cohen @xcite and extended to the form below by kozen and smith @xcite .",
    "( the statement uses some notions that will not be defined until later , but we only need a vague understanding of it here . )    [ thm : subsumehoare ] let @xmath24 , and let @xmath25 be the universal regular expression .",
    "then the following are equivalent .",
    "@xmath26    the primary consequence of this theorem is that the horn theory of kleene algebra , restricted to formulas with hypotheses of the form @xmath0 , is decidable , and remains unchanged if we restrict to @xmath15-continuous or relational algebras : to decide if @xmath27 is valid , we simply decide if @xmath28 is valid . in this way , we say that we have _ eliminated _ the hypothesis @xmath0 .",
    "it is also possible to eliminate other forms of hypotheses @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath0 has particular significance , because partial correctness assertions can be expressed in @xmath29 with equations of the form @xmath0 ( and multiple equations @xmath30 can be combined into @xmath31 ) .",
    "so theorem  [ thm : subsumehoare ] shows that the horn theory of @xmath29 , restricted to hypotheses of the form @xmath0 , subsumes propositional hoare logic , is decidable , and is furthermore complete for relational interpretations @xcite .    our main result , theorem  [ thm : genzeroelim ] ( p.  ) , improves theorem  [ thm : subsumehoare ] so that @xmath0 can be eliminated in the presence of other hypotheses .",
    "this allows any other technique for eliminating hypotheses to be extended to include @xmath0 .",
    "for example , if we have a technique for eliminating @xmath32 alone , we can eliminate @xmath33 by first eliminating @xmath0 using theorem  [ thm : genzeroelim ] , leaving hypothesis @xmath32 , which can then be eliminated . in this way , theorem  [ thm : genzeroelim ] is like a module for eliminating @xmath0 that can be added on to any other technique for eliminating hypotheses .",
    "a related result , corollary  [ cor : syntactichomo ] , shows that hypotheses of the form @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is boolean and @xmath3 is atomic ) can be eliminated in the presence of other hypotheses , although the remaining hypotheses are modified .",
    "hypotheses of the form @xmath34 are useful for eliminating redundant code ( consider our example @xmath6 above ; it expresses the fact that @xmath3 is redundant when @xmath4 already holds ) . ( the procedure for eliminating @xmath34 was introduced in @xcite , where it was shown how to eliminate @xmath34 and @xmath0 at the same time . without the benefit of theorem  [ thm : genzeroelim ] , this required a construction that simultaneously dealt with both @xmath34 and @xmath0 . )",

    "an _ idempotent semiring _ is a structure @xmath36 satisfying @xmath37 ( in other words , @xmath38 is an upper semilattice with bottom element @xmath39 , @xmath40 is a monoid , @xmath39 is an annihilator for @xmath41 , and @xmath41 distributes over @xmath42 on the right and left . )",
