    "on one side , in some lattices intrinsic lattice defects like vacancies lead to the formation local magnetic moments , a preliminary condition for the existence of magnetic order .",
    "this is the case in graphite@xcite , graphene@xcite and ii - vi semiconductors@xcite . on the other side",
    ", it has been recently found that clusters with specific shapes , like triangular graphene islands@xcite or icosahedral@xcite gold clusters , have large degeneracies at the fermi energy in their single particle spectra .",
    "these degeneracies are related to the symmetry of the nanostructure and , in words of luo _",
    "et al._@xcite , they behave like superatoms , with magnetic ground states that comply with atomic - like hund s rules .",
    "importantly , both vacancy induced@xcite and superatomic magnetism@xcite occur in graphene structures and , as we show here , have the same origin . in this work we present extensive numerical work to understand vacancy induced magnetism in graphene and graphene ribbons and we analyze our results in the context of a broader theoretical framework that unifies superatomic@xcite and vacancy induced magnetism@xcite in graphene . in part",
    "our motivation stems from the recently shown possibility of fabricating high mobility graphene based field effect transistors@xcite which has created enormous interest in graphene based electronics@xcite .",
    "additional possibilities arise from the fabrication of semiconducting graphene ribbons@xcite and graphene nanoislands@xcite with top - down techniques as well as the growth of graphene islands with bottom - up techniques@xcite .",
    "magnetic order in patterned or nanostructured graphene would bring up new opportunities of research in spintronics .",
    "graphene honeycomb structure is a bipartite lattice , formed by two interpenetrating triangular sublattices , a and b , such that the first neighbors of an atom a belong to the sublattice b and viceversa@xcite .",
    "the low - energy electronic structure of graphene can be described by a single - orbital ( @xmath5 ) nearest - neighbor hopping hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "this model correctly describes two dimensional graphene as a zero gap semiconductor with linear bands around the fermi energy .",
    "the single particle spectrum of a nearest - neighbor tight - binding model in a bipartite lattice has particle - hole symmetry@xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of both graphene - based nanostructures and defective graphene are intimately related to the appearance of midgap states and how they are affected by electron - electron interactions .",
    "the existence of zero - energy states in disordered bipartite lattices was proved by inui et al.@xcite . within the first - neighbor tight - binding model ,",
    "a sufficient condition@xcite for the existence of midgap states is the existence of a finite sublattice imbalance , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the number of atoms belonging to each sublattice or missing from each sublattice in an otherwise perfect system .",
    "thus , whereas ideal graphene has @xmath9 and no midgap states , both defective graphene and some graphene islands , such as triangles , can present finite sublattice imbalance and @xmath10 midgap states .",

    "incidentally , the existence of zero - energy or midgap states in uncompensated graphene structures was known long ago in the context of chemical studies of hydrocarbons as the longuet - higgis conjecture@xcite .",

    "sublattice unbalanced neutral graphene will always present a finite total magnetic moment .",

    "the most notorious example of compensated ferrimagnetic order can be found in zigzag ribbons@xcite , where each edge presents ferromagnetic order antiparallel to each other for a total vanishing magnetic moment .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the low - energy physics that takes place in the subspace expanded only by the single @xmath12 orbital ( the one perpendicular to the graphene plane ) .",
    "next - to - near neighbor hopping is neglected and the electron - electron interactions are included locally in the form of an on - site repulsion or hubbard model . when the interactions are turned off this reduces to the widespread one orbital tight - binding model@xcite .",
    "the hubbard term is treated in a mean field approximation@xcite .",
    "comparison between the results so obtained and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations yield very good agreement for two - dimensional graphene@xcite , carbon nanotubes@xcite , zigzag@xcite and armchair graphene ribbons@xcite , as well as graphene islands@xcite .",
    "we model vacancies and voids in perfect graphene or graphene ribbons by removing atoms , actually , by removing the representing @xmath12 orbitals in the tight - binding model .",
    "this results in a reduction of the coordination of the atoms adjacent to the missing atoms .",
    "we ignore the lattice distorsion and we assume that the on - site energy is the same for edge and bulk atoms .",
    "the single - orbital hamiltonian implicitly assumes full hydrogen passivation of the @xmath13 dangling bonds of the atoms without full coordination .",
    "this assumption , which might not be completely realistic in the case of actual vacancies@xcite , does not invalidate our model ; for we can consider an alternative physical realization : the chemisorption of a hydrogen atom on top of a bulk graphene atom@xcite effectively removes a @xmath12 orbital from the low - energy hamiltonian . in our one - orbital model",
    "there is no difference between these two scenarios .",
    "dft calculations on graphene ribbons@xcite , graphene islands@xcite , and bulk graphene with vacancies@xcite have shown that the results follow the predictions of lieb s theorem , even though dft calculations go beyond the first - neighbor hopping , short - range interaction hubbard model on which the theorem is based .",
    "in other words , second neighbour hopping and inter - site coulomb repulsion , present in the dft calculations , do not modify the relation between lattice imbalance and total spin of the ground state warranted for the hubbard model for which these couplings are absent . from this point of view",
    "these couplings are irrelevant .",
    "it is thus justified to consider the following mean - field hamiltonian : @xmath14 where @xmath15 runs over all lattice sites and the non - interacting hamiltonian reads @xmath16 where the sum runs over nearest - neiborgh lattice sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 ev . without loss of generality , we have set the diagonal terms of the hamiltoninan to zero .",
    "for neutral graphene we can rewrite the mean - field hamiltonian ( up to a constant ) as the sum of two terms : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the second term in @xmath22",
    "represents the non - trivial contribution of interactions .",
    "the calculations have been performed considering three different types of boundary conditions . for the evaluation of the non - interacting density of states ( dos ) in ribbons",
    "we compute the green s function projected on the region where the defects are located .",
    "the perfect regions of the ribbon away from the defects are included in the green s function by means of a self - energy .",
    "we refer the reader to ref . for more details on this methodology .",
    "when the interactions are turned on ( @xmath23 ) we consider ribbons with periodic boundary conditions in one direction or , for bulk graphene , periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "more details will be given in the respective sections .",
    "in this section we provide some general rules to understand the appearance of midgap states and magnetic textures due to single - atom vancacies or , more generally , voids in an otherwise sublattice balanced graphene structure , for instance , an infinite defect - free semiconducting armchair ribbon .",
    "a void in graphene can be partially characterized by the number and type , a or b , of atoms removed from the otherwise perfect structure .",
    "we will label voids as one would do for chemical compounds , a@xmath24b@xmath25 .",
    "voids will be unbalanced when the are created by removing @xmath7 and @xmath8 atoms such that @xmath26 the sublattice imbalance @xmath27 , which can be either positive or negative , can be interpreted as an imbalance `` charge '' .",
    "this quantity is central to our discussion , although the exact formula of the void is also important since it gives an idea of the size and shape of the void . in the case of ribbons",
    "the voids can be close to the edges , becoming thus notches .",
    "( for the most part we will refer to voids in the bulk of the ribbon , but the conclusions apply equally to the case of notches on the edges . ) for a single unbalanced void characterized by @xmath27 , @xmath10 zero - energy states appear in the non - interacting spectrum with weight on only one sublattice@xcite .",
    "when the graphene structure presents a gap @xmath28 , as in armchair ribbons , these states are normalizable and localized around the void ( in contrast to two - dimensional graphene where the zero - energy states are not normalizable@xcite ) .",
    "figure [ voids ] shows various examples of voids in a ribbon with different sublattice imbalance @xmath27 .",

    "according to the result of inui et al.@xcite , the single particle spectrum has , at least , @xmath32 midgap states .",
    "the important question is what happens when the distance between them is such that they do affect each other .",
    "if @xmath30 and @xmath31 have the same sign , there are @xmath33 midgap states , regardless of the distance .",
    "if they have different signs , e.g. , @xmath34 , eq . [ ita ] apparently warrants the annihilation of midgap states . within the non - interacting model midgap states are 100 percent sublattice polarized .",
    "the non - interacting hamiltonian has finite matrix elements between states that have weight on different sublattices .",
    "hence , the mechanism for midgap state annihilation is hybridization of midgap states localized in different sublattices .",
    "this annihilation occurs as bonding - antibonding pairs of midgap states form , resulting in a shift in their energy and in a loss of the sublattice polarization . for large distances , however , this annihilation does not occur .",
    "a well understood related example occurs in zigzag ribbons@xcite .",
    "the edge of a zigzag ribbon has a local sublattice imbalance .",
    "if the top edge belongs to the a sublattice , the bottom edge belongs to the b sublattice .",
    "states fully localized in the edge have zero energy and are localized in a single sublattice . to the extent that states mostly localized on the top edge penetrate into the ribbon , they hybridize with states mostly localized on the bottom edge .",
    "this mixing results in a bonding - antibonding splitting that takes these states away from the dirac energy . in the case of zigzag ribbons ,",
    "the degree of localization in the unit cell depends on the wavevector .",
    "states close to the zone boundary are very localized in the edges and have energy very close to zero@xcite .",
    "the localization decreases as the wavevector departs from the boundary , resulting in the hybridization and the departure from zero energy@xcite .    in the general case",
    "one can conclude that the minimum number of zero - energy states will be given by @xmath35 where the integer indeces @xmath36 and @xmath37 run over voids with the same imbalance sign , respectively . in practice , within an arbitrarily small energy interval @xmath38 , the number of zero - energy states can be as large as @xmath39 in the general case , @xmath40 will be a number between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    when electron - electron interactions are turned on , at least locally in the form of a hubbard - type interaction , lieb s theorem guarantees that @xmath43 for neutral graphene .",
    "the theorem , however , does not exclude the possibility of spin - symmetry broken local magnetic order when @xmath1 or small .",
    "for instance , two or more voids with local sublattice imbalances that cancel out the total imbalance can still retain their local magnetic order when they are not in proximity . when the imbalance of the void is zero but the size is large an internal ferrimagnetic order can not be discarded either . in general , calculations will be necessary to ascertain the spin texture in these situations .",
    "a few conclusions , however , can be reached without actually performing any calculations .",
    "one can distinguish four cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath44 : in this case all the voids are of the same sign .",
    "the coupling between them is always ferromagnetic and the spin of the ground state is @xmath45 .",
    "the splitting with smaller spin states will depend on the inter - void coupling .",
    "@xmath46 : in this case all the voids of different sign are in proximity and interact , yielding a @xmath47 state .",
    "calculations will be necessary to ascertain the spin texture in these situations .",
    "@xmath48 : in this case all the voids of different type are separated and uncoupled .",
    "the ground state has @xmath47 , but the spin - flip gap is negligible since there are uncoupled magnetic moments .",
    "@xmath49 : in this case there are voids of different sign , but some of them are uncoupled and some not .",
    "this is the most general case .",
    "the ground state has @xmath47 , but , as in the previous case , the spin - flip gap is negligible since there are uncoupled magnetic moments .",
    "calculations will be necessary to ascertain the spin texture in these situations as well .",
    "in this section we study the electronic structure of defective graphene ribbons within the non - interacting tight - binding model .",
    "the results are obtained using the cluster embedded method described in ref . .",
    "in this methodology a finite portion of the ribbon containing the defects is attached to two semi - infinite perfect ribbons of the same width and compute the dos of the defective region . in the defect",

    "their electronic structure might be strongly influenced by impurities .",
    "here we study the effect of vacancies and voids , which are expected to act as neutral impurities .",

    "monoatomic vacancies have the shape of a triangle",
    ". two vertices of the triangle point towards the edges of the ribbon , whereas the lateral vertex can point downstream or upstream along the ribbon .",

    "importantly , the _ integrated _ charge , including both mid - gap and band states below the fermi energy , yields a homogeneous charge distribution : there is one electron per atom in every atom , even in the presence of the vacancy .",

    "away from the edges , a single monoatomic vacancy might not result in a local atomic configuration that can be described with our model . on the other side ,",
    "the effect of a hydrogen atom atop a carbon atom on graphene is very similar to the one described by our model@xcite .",
    "hence , the anomalous magnetic behaviour of irradiated graphite might be related to @xmath195 pairs , rather than to missing atoms .",
    "it is also important to signal that the mean field approximation is known to overestimate the appearence of magnetic order and yield critical values of @xmath196 smaller than those obtained with methods that include quantum fluctuations@xcite .",
    "finally , we have neglected both second neighbor hopping and interatomic coulomb repulsions .",
    "interestingly , both dft and mean field hubbard model yield a very similar description of the magnetic behaviour of graphene islands@xcite and zigzag graphene ribbons@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the couplings neglected in the simple hubbard model have a small effect on the low energy electronic structure that dominates the physical properties .",
    "we now summarize the main conclusions of this work . in the context of our model ,",
    "the main results are :    1 .",
    "the electronic properties of the defects arising from the removal of atoms from graphene depend dramatically on an integer number , the sublattice imbalance ( or imbalance charge ) @xmath197 , which counts the difference in the total number of atoms per sublattice removed from a perfectly balanced graphene lattice .",
    "@xmath27 can take values @xmath198 etc .",
    "2 .   it can be rigorously shown@xcite that the single - particle spectrum of a structure with sublattice imbalance @xmath27 has , at least , @xmath10 midgap states per spin channel , occupied by @xmath10 electrons in neutral graphene .",
    "3 .   repulsive coulomb interactions will result in a many - body ground state with @xmath199 .",
    "this is an exact result in the case of the hubbard model@xcite .",
    "whereas the global electronic structure of a given graphene system is given by the lieb , the local structure is not . by assigning _",
    "sublattice imbalance numbers to defects , provided that they are sufficiently apart , a set of rules to predict basic features of the magnetic structure has been proposed . 5 .",
    "we find that single voids with @xmath200 give rise to states with spin - charge separation , in the sense that a localized magnetic texture does not entail charge localization .",
    "the addition of a single electron to the system results in a many - body state with @xmath1 and the disappearance of the magnetic texture , which is substituted by a charge texture , as seen in fig .",
    "[ spin - charge - sep ] . in this sense , the properties of these states are very similar to su - schrieffer - heeger midgap states@xcite .",
    "the addition rules for two voids with a givel local sublattice imbalance or imbalance charge present similarities with those of vortices , e.g. , in superconductors .",
    "when sufficiently apart , two voids with local imbalance @xmath201 and @xmath202 behave like two independent objects with local spin @xmath199 . below a certain distance",
    "they annihilate each other and the local magnetization vanishes ( fig . [ pairs ] ) .",
    "when two voids with the same sign are brought together , they result in a region with enhanced local magnetization and spin @xmath203 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figsingle ] . 7 .   in analogy with graphene nanoislands@xcite , sufficiently large voids with @xmath9 can still have local magnetic moments .",
    "these can interpreted as if the large void with @xmath9 was the sum of two voids with @xmath204 .",
    "an example of this is the rhomboid of fig .",
    "[ rombo ] , obtained from merging two triangular voids with @xmath205 back to back . 8 .",
    "our results show that spin interactions between two magnetic defects of same @xmath10 can be of three types : ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic or annihilating . in the first case , the ground state spin is the sum of the spins of the magnetic defects when infinitely apart , in the second case the spin is the difference between those two . in the third case both the total and",
    "the local spins are zero .",
    "antiferromagnetic and annihilating couplings occur in lattices without global sublattice imbalance , whereas ferromagnetic coupling requires global sublattice imbalance .",
    "our simulations show that , in balanced defective structures , there is a maximal density of monoatomic vacancies that can sustain local moments . in the case of ribbons ,",
    "this critical density depends on the ribbon width .",
    "the critical density also depends on @xmath82 . a phase diagram for bulk graphene",
    "is provided in fig [ u_cri ] . 10 .",
    "depending on the density of vacancies , distributed randomly in the two sublattices , we distinguish three phases . in the very dilute limit",
    "the system is paramagnetic , with some common properties with ii - vi diluted magnetic semiconductors . in the opposite high - density limit the local moments are annihilated .",
    "the intermediate phase features antiferromagnetically coupled local moments .",
    "this would be a realization of the so - called diluted antiferromagnet@xcite 11 .",
    "we predict giant zeeman splitting in the case of semiconducting ribbons in the dilute limit .",
    "uppon application of an external magnetic field such that @xmath206 , the magnetic moment of all the defects would point parallel to applied field .",
    "this would result in a interaction induced splitting in the band states , much larger than the ordinary zeeman splitting , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure - dms ] . 12 .",
    "a ferromagnetic phase is not expected for defective graphene , unless vacancies occur predominantly in one of the two sublattices .",
    "such an unbalanced situation would require further explanation . 13 . in the case of zero - gap graphene",
    ", we find that midgap states survive , even in the interacting case , in the very dilute limit ( fig .",
    "[ gap ] ) . since",
    "ideal graphene is a semimetal , the thermodynamics properties of graphene might be dominated by this type of defects .    upon completion of this manuscript , a related work by o. v. yazyev ( axiv:0802.1735 ) has been reported .",
