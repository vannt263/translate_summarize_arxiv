    "pulse peaks in gamma - ray burst ( grb ) lightcurves evolve in time from higher to lower energies and become wider . @xcite provide measurements of such lags as observed in grbs between different energy channels of the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) .",
    "the lags are measured by calculating the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) . in a sample of grbs for which the redshift is known it",
    "is found that the spectral lag is related to the isotropic gamma - ray peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "similarly @xcite have shown that measures of variability in grb lightcurves ( see also reichart et al . [ 2001 ] ) are related to the isotropic gamma - ray peak luminosity .",
    "vice versa , measurements of variability or of spectral lags can then be used as a crude distance indicator for the grb .",
    "observed timescales ( variability or spectral lags ) as well as peak luminosity naturally have a strong dependence on the doppler factor of the outflow ( a function of the lorentz factor and the direction of motion with respect to the observer ) .",
    "if indeed the doppler factor is the dominant parameter among grbs , a relation between spectral lags / variability and luminosity is expected .",
    "crucial to our understanding of what causes the grb is the question of whether grb engines are in some sense `` standard candles '' .",
    "observationally it is found that the isotropic equivalent energies of grbs range from about 5 @xmath0 10@xmath1 to 1.4 @xmath0 10@xmath2 ergs @xcite .",
    "however , transitions have been observed at optical and radio wavelengths which can be interpreted as being due to collimated ( jetted ) outflow @xcite . when correcting the observed @xmath3-ray energies for the geometry of the outflow , grb energies appear narrowly clustered around @xmath4 ergs ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ; see also panaitescu and kumar 2001 .",
    "@xcite infer the jet opening angle from the observed jet - break time and find that there is a wide range in opening angles .",
    "the reason for why this range in angles exists is currently not understood .",
    "the idea that grb energies may be narrowly clustered was also put forward by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite proposed that there exists not a range in opening angles , but that all bursts derive from a single - burst - jet morphology and that the variation in viewing angle of the jet yields the observed variation among grbs .    in this paper",
    "is presented a tight correlation between jet - break times , @xmath5 , and pulse lags , @xmath6 . since",
    "luminosity and pulse lags have been shown to be correlated , this also represents a relation between luminosity and jet - break times . as time scales and peak luminosity are strong functions of the doppler factor of the outflow , this relation suggests the jet - break time to also be a strong function of the doppler factor .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result on our understanding of the morphology of the explosion .",
    "the relativistic blast - wave model has become the ` standard ' model for the interpretation of grbs and their afterglows ( see piran [ 2000 ] for a review ) .",
    "it invokes the release of a large amount of energy , resulting in an ultra - relativistic outflow . in this model",
    "the grb is produced in internal shocks . during or after the grb emission phase a strong shock",
    "is formed when these ( merged ) shells run into the surrounding medium . as the ( forward ) shock is weighed down by increasing amounts of swept - up material it produces a slowly fading ` afterglow ' at radio to x - ray wavelengths .",
    "observations of the grb and the afterglow at gamma- and x - ray wavelengths @xcite suggest that indeed in some cases the afterglow commences during or shortly after the grb .",
    "if the grb is due to internal shocks and the afterglow is due to the external forward shock then little connection between the two phenomena is to be expected .",
    "nevertheless the afterglow is the result of the interaction of colliding shells ( that produced the grb ) with the ambient medium and some level of imprint from the grb phase may be expected to be present in the afterglow .",
    "the clustering of grb energies ( a property of the grb phase ) inferred from measurements of the jet - break times ( a property of the afterglow ) suggests a possible relation between grb and afterglow properties . we investigate a complete sample of seven grbs for which measurements of the redshift , the spectral lag , the luminosity , and of the jet - break time are available .",
    "we collect redshifts and jet - break times from @xcite , spectral data from @xcite and batse pulse lags for six bursts from @xcite . to this set",
    "we have added the data of grb991216 ( observed lag @xmath7 seconds ; j.  p.  norris 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "the correlation between rest - frame batse pluse lags , @xmath6 , and jet - break times , @xmath8 , is shown in figure [ tjvtlag ] ; bursts with longer lags have longer jet - break times .",
    "the data is fit with a least - squares fit using errors in two - dimensions where errors on spectral lags are given in @xcite and errors in jet - break time are considered presently .",
    "jet - break times from the sample of @xcite have not been determined uniformly : some of the jet - break times are derived from multi - band modeling ( covering the radio to x - ray passbands ) , while other events have primarily been observed in a single passband , and are less well constrained .",
    "@xcite estimate that uncertainties in jet - break times range between 10 - 30% .",
    "we therefore assume a 10% error for break times determined from broad - band modeling ( grb990510 ) , and 30% for break times determined from mainly fitting to a single passband ( grb970828 , grb990123 , and grb991216 ) .",
    "we make exceptions for grb970508 and grb980703 as follows .",
    "frail , waxman & kulkarni ( 2000 ) have modeled grb 970508 with a wide - angled jet with @xmath9 = 25 days .",
    "the radio observations require a jet - break but optical observations do not require such a transition , though they are consistent with a late breaking at @xmath10 days @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume a large 50% error in the jet - break time of grb970508 and caution the reader to consider this number uncertain .",
    "grb980703 has one of the richest multi - band data sets .",
    "however , due to the brightness of its host galaxy the jet - break time is not that well constrained , and multi - frequency modeling requires a jet - break between @xmath11 days ( e.berger , private communication ; berger et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) ; we use @xmath12 days .",
    "for grb971214 the jet - break time has not been measured and @xcite provided a lower limit .",
    "however , we are of the opinion that the jet - break time of grb971214 is essentially unconstrained in view of the recent evidence for hard electron energy distributions in grb afterglows @xcite . such distributions result in slowly decaying afterglows .",
    "in addition , the optical light curve of grb971214 is not very well sampled @xcite .",
    "these facts allow for a much earlier jet - break transition than @xcite have provided : it could have occured between a few hours after the event and more than a month after .",
    "we do not use grb971214 in any of the following fits , although for reference we show the jet - break time of @xcite in the figures .",
    "a small break time would be consistent with its close proximity to the relations shown in the figures of this paper .    using the ccf31 0.1 lags , determined by cross - correlating pulses in batse channels 1 & 3 down to 0.1 of the peak luminosity @xcite , a good fit results : @xmath13 ( shown in fig .",

    "six used in the fit ) , the data is sparse , but the correlation is clear and surprisingly tight .",
    "@xcite also calculated lags fitting down to 0.5 of the peak luminosity which gives a looser fit @xmath16 with @xmath17 and a goodness - of - fit @xmath18 .",
    "note that eqn .",
    "( [ t_jeqn ] ) simply relates two timescales and as such does not have a direct dependance on spectral ambiguities involved in calculating k - corrections for the peak luminosity .",
    "since pulse lag and luminosity are correlated @xcite , transitivity suggests a third relation between luminosity and jet - break times .",
    "we calculate peak luminosites , @xmath19 , for the seven grbs , from batse peak fluxes and spectral parameters in @xcite and implement a k - correction as in @xcite .",
    "the k - correction used here transforms the [ 50,300 ] kev luminosity band observed at earth to a [ 20,2000 ] kev band local to the burst .",
    "errors in peak luminosity were calculated using the default systematic errors used by @xcite ; in particular we take 10 % errors in peak flux and spectral break energy and 20 % errors in the specral indices .",
    "a fit to the data is @xmath20 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ lvtlag ] ) with @xmath21 and @xmath22 . with the large @xmath23",
    "this relation is nt nearly as tight as that of eqn .",
    "( [ t_jeqn ] ) , but it does highlight the trend discovered by @xcite that brighter bursts have shorter timescales . we find that this trend applies for jet - break times , whereas @xcite found a similar trend for spectral lag .",
    "note also that the errors in the fitting parameters derived from the chi - squared fit are not reliable due to the high @xmath23 .",
    "in @xcite the isotropic energy , @xmath24 , is compared with the jet - break time @xmath5 .",
    "as above , we fit these two quantities , taking k - corrected values for @xmath24 from @xcite .",

    "( [ leqn ] ) , the quality of the fit is poor , but the trend that bursts of higher energy have shorter jet - break timescales is plainly evident .",
    "this relation allows one to test the suggestion by @xcite that there is a reservoir for gamma - ray energy , @xmath28 , that is constant for all grbs . for bursts with a large jet - opening angle , @xmath29",
    ", this energy would be spread out , resulting in lower fluxes and lower inferred isotropic energies , @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests @xmath30 constant = @xmath31 .",
    "the assumption that energy in gamma - rays is constant predicts @xmath32 , which is not consistent with the data .",
    "thus , while the range of observed @xmath28 is significantly smaller than that of @xmath24 , it is not exactly constant .    the existence of these correlations , in particular the relation between jet - break times and spectral lags , point to a surprisingly direct relationship between the grb phase ( represented by the pulse lag and the luminosity ) and the afterglow phase ( represented by the jet break time ) . in the next section we will argue that these relationships are kinematic in origin .",
    "the effectively linear relationship between the two timescales ; pulse lags @xmath6 and jet - break times @xmath5 ( eqn .  [ t_jeqn ] ) suggests a surprisingly direct connection between the grb phase , from which the pulse lags are derived , and the afterglow phase , from which jet - break times derive .",
    "an initial conclusion that can be drawn is that , since the grb phase is generally thought not to depend on the density of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , this relation disfavors explanations of the jet break deriving from external causes such as sudden drops in ism density @xcite .",

    "taking @xmath59 to be essentially constant compared to @xmath19 and @xmath24 , then , to the extent that @xmath19 is constant over the burst duration , we expect @xmath64 .",
    "the variability - luminosity relationship @xcite would imply that dimmer burts are less variable in luminosity and thus we expect they will have the strongest correlation @xmath64 ( they come closest to the assumption of constant luminosity over the burst duration ) , while brighter , more variable bursts will appear more chaotic ; a trend that appears to be reflected in the data ( see figures [ lvtlag ] and [ eisovtj ] ) . thus , overall , it is not surprising that both @xmath19 and @xmath24 have similar slopes in @xmath5 .    given that observed timescales in general vary as @xmath65 , and , as discussed above , luminosities also appear to be functions of the doppler boost , we are led to the intriguing possibility that all of the relationships described here ( eqns .",

    "because relativistic beaming is strongest along the line of sight , material moving directly toward the observer will dominate the emission .",
