    "reaction mechanisms in collisions of weakly bound nuclei have been intensively investigated in the last years  @xcite , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "these mechanisms may be particularly interesting in collisions of halo nuclei , where the breakup process and its influence on other reaction channels , such as fusion , tend to be very strong .",
    "however , the processes involved in collisions of stable weakly bound nuclei , like @xmath4li , @xmath0li and @xmath5be , are expected to be qualitatively similar . on the other hand ,",
    "the intensities of stable beams are several orders of magnitude larger than those presently available for radioactive beams .",
    "for this reason , collisions of stable weakly bound nuclei have been widely studied . since performing direct measurements of breakup cross sections is a very hard task , most experiments determine fusion and elastic cross sections .",
    "recent experiments have shown that transfer processes followed by breakup may predominate over direct breakup of stable weakly bound nuclei at sub - barrier energies @xcite .",
    "+ in a recent paper @xcite we have reported continuum discretized coupled channel ( cdcc ) calculations for collisions of @xmath6li projectiles with @xmath1co , @xmath2sm and @xmath3pb targets at near - barrier energies .",
    "we have evaluated coulomb , nuclear and total breakup angular distributions , as well as the corresponding integrated cross sections . we have observed strong coulomb - nuclear interference , and found that the nuclear and the coulomb components of the breakup cross sections follow scaling laws .",
    "for the same @xmath7 ( energy normalized to the coulomb barrier ) , the nuclear component of the breakup cross section is proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the target s mass number .",
    "an explanation for this behavior was latter given by hussein _",
    "_ @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the coulomb breakup component was shown to depend linearly on the target s atomic number , @xmath10 . in the present paper",
    "we complement the previous work by performing the same kind of analysis for @xmath0li projectiles .",
    "+ there are two important differences between the @xmath4li and @xmath0li lithium isotopes .",
    "the first is that the breakup threshold energy , or q - value , of @xmath0li is about 1 mev lower than that of @xmath0li .",
    "they are respectively 1.47 and 2.47 mev .",
    "the second difference is that @xmath0li has a non - zero low energy dipole strength , contrary to @xmath4li .",
    "their dipole responses are related to their cluster structure ( @xmath11 - t and @xmath11 - d for the @xmath12li and @xmath6li , respectively ) .",
    "in fact , using the cluster model , the @xmath13 distribution in the projectile @xmath14 , is given by @xcite , @xmath15^{2 } e^2 .",
    "\\label{be1-a}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] above , @xmath16 is the reduced mass of the @xmath14 system , @xmath17 is cluster spectroscopic factor and @xmath18 is a normalization constant which takes into account the finite range of the @xmath19 potential .",
    "the @xmath13 value is obtained by integrating the above over @xmath20 , @xmath21 ^ 2 e^2 \\frac{1}{q}. \\label{be1}\\ ] ] using eq .",
    "( [ be1 ] ) , one finds for @xmath12li : @xmath22 . on the other hand , the above expression vanishes identically for @xmath6li .",
    "this implies a larger coulomb breakup for @xmath12li .",
    "in fact the coulomb breakup of @xmath6li is dominated by higher multipolarities , such as quadrupole .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this issue can be found in @xcite . + as in our previous work , the choice of the @xmath1co , @xmath2sm and @xmath3pb targets was based on the availability of elastic scattering data at near - barrier energies . in this way",
    ", we were able to check the reliability of our cdcc model applying it to elastic scattering and comparing the theoretical cross sections with the data .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii some details of our cdcc model space are given .",
    "in section iii the results of our calculation are discussed , while the section iv is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "the most suitable approach to deal with the breakup process , which feeds to the population of states in the continuum , is the so called cdcc method  @xcite . in this type of calculations ,",
    "the continuum wave functions are grouped into bins , or wave packets , that can be treated similarly to the usual bound inelastic states , since they are described by square - integrable wave functions . in the present work we use the same assumptions and methodology of the cdcc calculations of refs .",
    "we assume that @xmath0li breaks up directly into an @xmath11-particle and a tritium , with separation energy @xmath23 mev .",
    "to describe the breakup of the projectile into two charged fragments , we used the cluster model .",
    "we consider that the two clusters are bound in the entrance channel and the first inelastic channel with spin @xmath24 and excitation energy 0.477 mev .",
    "the remaining projectile states are all in the discretized continuum .",
    "resonant states of the projectile are explicitly taken into account , to avoid double counting . in all calculations of the present work",
    ", we performed our numerical calculations using the code fresco @xcite .",
    "+ in the standard cdcc method @xcite , the scattering of a projectile , composed by a core _",
    "c _ ( the alpha particle in the present work ) and a valence particle _ p _ ( the triton ) , by a target _",
    "t _ is modelled by the hamiltonian : @xmath25 where k@xmath26 is the projectile - target relative kinetic motion , k@xmath27 is projectile internal kinetic energy , v@xmath28 is the p - c binding potential and u@xmath29 and u@xmath30 are the p - t and c - t optical potentials , respectively .",
    "these optical potentials are chosen by the condition of describing the elastic scattering of each cluster from the target .",
    "they have an imaginary part arising both from fusion of the cluster with the target and from the excitation of inelastic states in the target .",
    "thus , the breakup cross sections obtained in standard cdcc calculations correspond only to elastic breakup .",
    "however , the influence of inelastic breakup on elastic scattering is taken into account through the action of the imaginary parts of @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the surface region . to go beyond the standard cdcc method , treating target excitations explicitly",
    ", one should include in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) an additional term corresponding to the internal hamiltonian of the target .",
    "this procedure is not followed in the present work , where only inelastic states of the projectile are included in our channel space . + the sum of the cluster - target potentials of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) gives the total interaction between the projectile and the target .",
    "it can be written as @xmath33 where , @xmath34 is the vector joining the centers of mass of the projectile and the target , and @xmath35 is the relative position vector between the two clusters .",
    "@xmath36 gives the bare potentials ( diagonal matrix - elements ) , and also all couplings among the channels ( off - diagonal matrix - elements in channel space ) .",
    "this potential contains contributions from coulomb and from nuclear forces , and the importance of each contribution can be assessed switching off the other .",
    "+ concerning the cdcc model space for @xmath0li , the continuum ( nonresonant and resonant ) subspace is discretized into equally spaced momentum bins with respect to the momentum @xmath37 of the @xmath38 relative motion .",
    "the bin widths are suitably modified in the presence of the resonant states in order to avoid double counting . in this way , the discretization is as follows : continuum partial waves up to @xmath39 = 4 waves for a density of the continuum discretization of 2 bins / mev ( l = 0,1,2 ) ; 7.7 bins / mev and 1.92 bins / mev below and above the @xmath40 resonance , respectively ; 10 bins / mev inside the resonance ; 2.5 bins / mev and 2 bins / mev below and above the @xmath41 resonance , respectively ; 2.5 bins / mev inside the resonance ; 2 bins / mev for both @xmath42 and @xmath43 resonances .",
    "the projectile fragments - target potential multipoles up to the term @xmath44 = 4 were considered . for the interaction @xmath45 - tritium to generate the bins , we use an appropriate woods - saxon potential to describe the unbound resonant and nonresonant states otomar09,otomar10 . for the resonant states",
    ", we included a spin - orbit interaction . to get a finite set of coupled equations",
    ", one must truncate the discretized continuum at some maximal value of the excitation energy and of the orbital angular momentum of clusters .",
    "for this reason , rigorous convergence tests have to be performed .",
    "we have performed cdcc calculations for the @xmath12li + @xmath1co , @xmath12li + @xmath2sm and @xmath12li + @xmath3pb systems , for which elastic scattering data at near - barrier energies are available ( refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . for the alpha - target and tritium - target optical potentials of eq .",
    "( [ split ] ) , we used the double - folding so paulo potential  @xcite .",
    "the target densities , used in the folding integrals , were taken from the systematics of the so paulo potential  @xcite . assuming that charge and matter densities have similar distributions , the matter density distribution of the triton was obtained multiplying by 3 the charge distribution reported in ref .",
    "the matter density of the @xmath46he cluster was obtained through the same procedure .",
    "we assumed that the imaginary parts of the optical potentials have the same radial dependence of the real part , with a weaker strength .",
    "then , we adopted the expression , @xmath47\\,v_{\\scr spp}(r)$ ] , with @xmath48 standing for either the alpha or the tritium cluster , and @xmath49 standing for the so paulo potential .",
    "this procedure has been able to describe the reaction cross section ( and consequently the elastic angular distribution ) for many systems in a wide energy interval @xcite .",
    "li + @xmath3pb at 33.0 mev .",
    "data are from @xcite . ]    before calculating breakup cross sections , we made sure that our cdcc calculations were able to reproduce elastic scattering data .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which shows the theoretical and experimental elastic scattering cross sections for @xmath50 scattering at the bombarding energy @xmath51 mev .",
    "the agreement is good , except for some small discrepancies at backward angles .",
    "this is quite satisfactory , if one considers that there is no adjustable parameter in our calculations . +",
    "as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we write the elastic breakup cross section as , @xmath52 that is , the breakup cross section is split into a coulomb component , @xmath53 , a nuclear component , @xmath54 , and an interference term , @xmath55 .",
    "the two components were evaluated by cdcc calculations switching off either the nuclear or the coulomb part of the coupling interaction .",
    "+ to be fair , we should mention that the above procedure does not generate the full cdcc coulomb and nuclear components of the cross section as these are both influenced by the each others : the coulomb contribution is influenced by the nuclear scattering and the nuclear contribution is influenced by the coulomb scattering .",
    "however , to perform the separation within a coupled channel framework is a very hard task . on the other hand , this can easily be done within a distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) treatment of the breakup process @xcite .",
    "the dwba calculation is usually employed at higher energies or weak coupling to the breakup channel ( high q - value ) , and does not serve our purpose here . thus we have no other choice but to use the prescription originally employed by @xcite , and recently used by us @xcite , of switching off the undesired interaction to obtain the desired component .",
    "we believe that this approximate method of generating the coulomb and the nuclear breakup components of the coupled channels - calculated cross section is reasonable for very light targets , such as @xmath56c where the nuclear breakup dominates , and for very heavy targets , such as @xmath3pb where coulomb breakup by far dominates .",
    "however , we have no way to know how accurate the switching off method in the case of medium mass targets , where both the coulomb and nuclear components are equally important .",
    "it remains as an open problem the assessment of the error inherent in such a procedure within the coupled channels theory .",
