    "the fits to the multiband model using @xmath70 @xmath71 in table i are excellent [ solid lines in fig.2(b ) ] .",

    "interestingly , the @xmath72 suggest different @xmath73 and @xmath74 , i.e. approximately an order of magnitude different carrier mobilities in the two bands .",
    "this difference in the intraband diffusivities could be due to differences in scattering or effective masses @xcite .    figure 3(a )",
    "depicts the @xmath75 phase diagram of @xmath20 and @xmath30 versus se content @xmath7 for zrte@xmath2se@xmath3 . with increasing se content",
    "@xmath7 , the cdw order detected by @xmath16-axis resistivity anomaly is suppressed , vanishing around @xmath7 = 0.03 .",
    "sc @xmath9 gradually increases up to the maximum @xmath30 = 4.4 k around @xmath7 = 0.04 . with further increase in se",
    "the superconducting @xmath9 appears to have onset near 4 k , becoming much broader and with smaller shielding factor suggesting percolative nature of sc .",
    "even though the sample with higher se content can not be grown at present , it is clear that the sc should decrease to @xmath76 since zrse@xmath12 is a band insulator with a band gap of 1 ev @xcite .",
    "in contrast , hf substitution on zr site in zr@xmath77hf@xmath3te@xmath12 does not suppress the cdw order , and no sc is observed .",
    "this is different from irte@xmath11 , in which only 5d ir site substitution can suppress the charge / orbital order and induce sc @xcite .",
    "the hf doping does not alter the te2/te3 bands , which explains why hf doping can not suppress the cdw order and induce sc .    in what follows",
    "we compare the raman signal of superconducting crystals to raman signal of pure zrte@xmath0 with long range cdw order .",
    "figure 3(b ) depicts the raman spectra normalized to 86 @xmath78 mode of zrte@xmath2se@xmath3 measured at 5k and 300k with z(xx)z polarization for different se content .",
    "small se doping should not change the phonon spectrum at the room temperature and indeed , the 300 k spectra nearly overlap with each other . as expected , the raman spectrum of zrte@xmath12 measured at 5k is different from the one measured at 300k .",
    "two new modes appear around 115 @xmath78 and 152 @xmath78 , which we assign to cdw ( cdw mode ) @xcite .",
    "periodic lattice distortions in the cdw state will result in the new phonon modes below @xmath20 and some ( cdw modes ) can be observed in the raman spectra , for example in 1t - tise@xmath11 @xcite and 2h - nbse@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the 108 @xmath78 , 140 @xmath78 and 145 @xmath78 modes are suppressed to low intensity with small temperature dependent shift at low temperature .",
    "the intensity of the two cdw modes 115 at @xmath78 and 152 @xmath78 becomes weaker for @xmath7 = 0.04 and 0.1 .",
    "it should be noted that cdw modes are detected outside the phase boundary of cdw order .",
    "the normalized amplitudes of the two cdw modes exist for @xmath7 = 0.04 and 0.1 , in crystals with no cdw signature in resistivity .",
    "this suggests a coexistence of superconductivity and cdw - related lattice distortions .",
    "fermi surface of zrte@xmath0 contains multiple bands with both flat and dispersive portions as well as substantial hybridization of high mobility chalcogen - derived bands with low mobility metal - derived bands@xcite .",
    "we note that in zrte@xmath0 cdw fluctuations affect the angular resolved photoemission spectral function @xmath79 ) at temperatures above 200 k @xcite . scattering in such multiband cdw electronic system in the presence of local cdw fluctuations",
    "is dominated by scattering off collective cdw excitations below @xmath20 [ @xmath80@xmath81@xmath82 ; where @xmath83 is a constant parameter ] and the electron - phonon and impurity - like scattering off local cdw fluctuations above the @xmath20 [ @xmath80@xmath81@xmath84@xcite .",
    "both @xmath41 and @xmath42 are perfecly linear from about 60 k up to highest measured temperature of 300 k , whereas a @xmath81@xmath85 resistivity is observed from superconducting @xmath9 up to about 80 k [ fig .",
    "4(a , b ) ] . with suppression of the cdw order by pressure or doping ,",
    "cdw mode should vanish@xcite , and indeed the absence of characteristic cdw - related hump is observed in resistivity .",
    "however as evident in fig .",
    "4(c ) , the signature of cdw mode in zrte@xmath2se@xmath3 appears below about 100 k suggesting that the crystallographic vibration of the unit cell still senses cdw presence , but we speculate with no phase coherence .",
    "the resistivity shows that electron - electron scattering due to cdw fluctuations dominates over the electron - phonon scattering and provides @xmath41@xmath81@xmath82 temperature dependence with relatively high values of coefficient @xmath83 . as a result ,",
    "kadowaki - woods scaling @xmath86/@xmath87 is comparable to tl@xmath88ba@xmath88cuo@xmath89 , sr@xmath88ruo@xmath90 or na@xmath91coo@xmath88 [ fig .",
    "3(a ) insets]@xcite . in zrte@xmath12 , with increasing @xmath26 , cdw order is first enhanced and reaches maximum @xmath20 around 2 gpa @xcite , then decreases , vanishing around 5 gpa , whereas superconducting @xmath30 increases monotonically up to highest pressures .",
    "the phase diagram in fig .",
    "4b is different from this but se could act as a chemical pressure due to its smaller size .",
    "therefore slight increase in band filling of the quasi-1d fermi surface sheet seen in pure zrte@xmath0 under pressure could be the mechanism for the in - plane anisotropy and promotion of sc @xcite .",
    "however , due to very small se content ( up to about 3 atomic % ) and no appreciable change in the unit cell parameters , this would imply strong sensitivity of cdw to substitutions on te site and possibly to disorder .",
    "as doping increases beyond @xmath92 the superconducing @xmath9 forms a weak dome or plateau - like temperature dependence similar to prfeaso@xmath77f@xmath93 @xcite .",
    "charge - mediated attraction is involved in both cdw and sc . for well nested fermi surface",
    "long range cdw is stable and superconductivity is only filamentary along a axis arising in the te2/te3 5p@xmath93 band @xcite . with se doping",
    "the cdw is no longer detected in scattering but dominant intraband interaction could ensure that patches of cdw still survive , as seen by raman .",
    "the small se substitution is unlikely to remove the nesting condition but may perturbe the long range phase coherence of cdw and consequently resistivity hump .",
    "broad superconducting transition , small reduction of sc transition temperature and significant decrease in the superconducting volume fraction suggest that the percolative sc is independent of se content once the cdw - related resistivity anomaly is absent .",
    "the above discussion suggests a possibility for a cdw - fluctuation induced heavy - fermion - like mass enhancement contribution to mass tensor anisotropy @xcite .",
    "moreover , superconductivity on the verge of the breakdown of the long - range cdw order is reminiscent to magnetic fluctuation mediated superconductivity in copper oxide and heavy fermion materials where the magnetic order is tuned by doping or pressure to @xmath94 at the quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "in summary , we show that superconductivity in zrte@xmath2se@xmath3 single crystals arises in the background of cdw fluctuations that contribute to significant anisotropy of the both normal state resistivity and the upper critical field in the superconducting state .",
    "the cdw fluctuations exist outside of the phase boundary of cdw order .",
    "single crystals of zrte@xmath2se@xmath3 were grown via iodine vapor transport method @xcite .",
    "the as grown single crystals can be easily cleaved along @xmath14-axis and @xmath15-axis , which usually produces needle- or tape- like crystals along @xmath14-axis in the @xmath95 plane ( shown in inset of fig .",
    "elemental analysis was performed by energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) on an fei helios nanolab 600i to determine the se content .",
    "the se content in as grown crystal is found to be less than the content in the starting material ; measured eds values are presented in figures .",
    "powder x ray diffraction confirms phase purity however there were no appreciable changes of the lattice parameters ( below 0.002  for @xmath96 and below 0.005  for @xmath15 lattice parameter ) , as expected for atomic substitution of up to about 3% .",
    "the crystal size becomes smaller when the se content @xmath7 increases , reducing from about 3 x 5 mm@xmath97 for @xmath98 down to 1.5 x 1.5 mm@xmath97 in @xmath95-plane for @xmath99 .",
