    "the potential of coupled high - quality cavities as a platform for simulating many - body quantum phenomena has attracted considerable interest over the past few years @xcite .",
    "such an architecture would indeed enable a high degree of control and addressability of individual sites .",
    "moreover , the coupling to atoms results in the formation of polaritons ( pseudo - particles involving atomic and photonic excitations ) , which can give rise to novel strongly correlated regimes of light and matter .",
    "a prototype of such systems is a coupled - cavity array ( cca ) described by the so called jaynes - cummings - hubbard ( jch ) model @xcite , where  due to the overlap between evanescent field modes  photons can hop across nearest - neighbour cavities and at the same time interact with two - level quantum emitters (  atoms \" ) . in the strong atom - field coupling regime ,",
    "an effective repulsive photon - photon interaction takes place resulting in a mott - insulator state for the system @xcite . the competition between this photon - blockade effect @xcite and the photon hopping creates a mott - insulator  superfluid quantum phase transition in analogy with the bose - hubbard model @xcite . besides being promising quantum simulators ( cf .",

    ", a quantum network must be capable of creating entanglement , performing quantum gates and transmitting quantum states between arbitrarily distant nodes .",
    "as atomic systems are long - lived quantum memories and photons can faithfully carry information over long distances , hybrid atom - photon interfaces indeed appear to be ideal building blocks of a quantum network architecture @xcite . from this perspective , a key issue is the study of excitation transport  in the form of photonic , atomic or polaritonic excitations  as well as quantum - state transfer ( qst ) @xcite across ccas @xcite .",
    "non - trivial dynamics are also exhibited by ccas featuring only a single cavity coupled to an atom @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the potential of a cca to work as a bus for achieving high - fidelity qst without demanding any dynamical control or measurement .",
    "qst is a pivotal task in quantum communication , which has been intensively investigated mostly in connection with spin chains following the seminal proposal by bose @xcite ( for a review see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . given an array of coupled qubits ( such as a spin chain ) , the goal of qst is transferring an arbitrary quantum state of a qubit located at one end of the array to the qubit at the opposite end .",
    "this should be performed by simply letting the many - qubit system to evolve in time according to its hamiltonian .",
    "achieving this with high - efficiency is , in general , non - trivial .",
    "for instance , this is not possible in chains ( especially long ones ) with uniform spin - spin couplings @xcite due to the detrimental dispersion of the initial wave packet . to get around it ,",
    "several schemes were thus put forward .",
    "it was shown , in particular , that perfect length - independent qst can be reached by engineering the spin - spin couplings so as to induce a linear dispersion relation @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for coupled harmonic systems ) .",
    "this yields a ballistic qst , entailing that the qst time is proportional to the chain length .",
    "a reliable local modulation involving the entire chain , however , would face several practical difficulties on the experimental side .",
    "ballistic qst can also be achieved under appropriate tuning of the outermost couplings @xcite .",
    "a different approach relies on the weak interaction of the sender and receiver spins with a bulk embodied by a uniform chain @xcite .",
    "schemes of this kind exploit the appearance of a pair of hamiltonian eigenstates strongly bi - localized at the outermost weakly - coupled sites ( behaving as chain defects ) , which brings about an effective rabi - like dynamics @xcite .",
    "a similar dynamics can be triggered by applying strong magnetic fields on the sender and receiver qubits or their nearest neighbors @xcite . at variance with ballistic qst protocols ,",
    "a usual drawback of rabi - like mechanisms is that they typically require long qst times . here",
    ", we assume a scheme of staggered inter - cavity coupling strengths , also known as the peierls distorted chain @xcite , which has been addressed for qst @xcite and quantum teleportation protocols  @xcite in spin systems ( ccas were considered for implementing distorted chains in refs .",
    "this model also belongs to the class of qst schemes relying on rabi - like dynamics , hence requiring relatively long transfer times .",
    "one of our goals is to keep a high - quality qst via rabi - like dynamics but , at the same time , significantly reduce the required transfer time .",
    "we show that this can be achieved by _ modularizing _ the array , namely connecting identical subunits of peierls distorted chains .",
    "we first discuss this in detail for an atom - free cca , which also applies to any spin chain ( irrespective of its realization ) having an analogous pattern of couplings .",
    "we then show how to exploit these findings when the cca is coupled to atoms in order to devise schemes for transferring atomic or polaritonic states .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we study the single - photon spectrum and stationary states of a staggered cca , highlighting in particular the features that are crucial for qst purposes . in section [ review ] , we review the basic ideas of qst in spin chains with a special focus on those schemes whose working principle relies on the formation of bi - localized states . in section [ atomfree ] , we study qst across a staggered atom - free cca . in section [ modularization ] ,",

    "the properties of an atom - free cca as seen in sections [ sec2 ] , [ atomfree ] , and [ modularization ] can be exploited to transfer polaritonic states across the array .    in the strong - coupling regime ( see section [ strong ] ) , the dynamics reduces to that of a pair of fully - dressed polaritonic bands . in either of these , a single - cavity polariton of given parity hops through the array just like a photon propagates through an atom - free cca ( see sections [ sec2 ] , [ atomfree ] and [ modularization ] ) apart from a 1/2 factor rescaling of hopping rates ( hence half of the propagation speed ) .",
    "given that the polaritonic bands are uncoupled , the preparation of a polariton of a given parity in a given cavity , say @xmath273 , will trigger a dynamics where solely polaritons of the same parity are involved .",

    "interestingly , in order for the polariton transfer to be effective , the requirement that @xmath5 must be strong enough in order to enable the entire set of dressed states to form is not strict .",
    "indeed , the nature of qst across an atom - free cca investigated in sections [ sec2 ] , [ atomfree ] , and [ modularization ] should make clear that , for a sufficiently distorted array , it is enough that @xmath5 is strong enough to enable the formation of the four bi - localized dressed states @xmath278 only . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we show how the onset of such dressing benefits polaritonic transfer as the cca is progressively distorted for a fixed value of the atom - field coupling strength @xmath5 . for the uniform array , i.e. , @xmath14 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) ] the transmission has a poor efficiency . as we have set @xmath240 ( middle of the free field spectrum ) ,",
    "thus not matching any field normal mode , and because @xmath5 is small , the evolution is dominated by its free field dynamics .",
    "hence , the atomic component of the initial polariton is about frozen @xcite while the photonic component propagates freely along the array , bouncing back and forth , with the dynamics ruled mostly by the unbound modes .",
    "the polaritonic transition amplitude significantly increases already by introducing a small amount of distortion [ see fig .",

    "the key ingredient is thus inducing the formation of bi - localized field normal modes and tuning the atoms on resonance with those .",
