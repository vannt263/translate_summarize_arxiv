    "darboux transformations define a mapping between the solutions of a linear differential equations and a similar equation containing different coefficients .",
    "since integrable nonlinear evolution equations frequently arise as the compatibility condition for a pair for such equations , darboux transformations may be used to construct families of exact solutions of the nonlinear equations .",
    "typically these are multi - soliton solutions .",
    "a good introduction to this topic , including the following example , is given in the monograph by matveev and salle .",
    "as an example which motivates the work to be presented , consider the lax pair and @xmath0 and so on . ] @xmath1 for the variant of the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation known as kpi @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is a real variable .",
    "this means that @xmath4=0 $ ] if and only if @xmath3 satisfies kpi .    for all non - zero @xmath5 such that @xmath6 , a darboux transformation is defined by the operator @xmath7 in the sense that @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the operators obtained from @xmath11 and @xmath12 by replacing @xmath3 by @xmath13 .",
    "this result is readily proved by observing that @xmath14 i.e. @xmath15 in this way the darboux transformation manifests itself as a ( differential ) gauge transformation .",
    "it also follows that @xmath16=0\\implies[\\t l,\\t m]=0,\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath17 satisfies kpi whenever @xmath3 does .",
    "hence the darboux transformation induces an auto - bcklund transformation .",
    "there is a problem with this transformation however . for almost all @xmath3 , since @xmath5 is the solution of a complex equation , @xmath17 is not real and so we do not obtain solutions of kpi . at the root of the problem",
    "is the fact that , while @xmath11 and @xmath12 are self - adjoint , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are not . in order to overcome this problem one may use a `` binary '' transformation ( to be defined in the next section ) which does preserve the self - adjointness of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this paper is concerned with the use of binary transformations to preserve the structure of two classes of operators with matrix coefficients and arbitrary order .",
    "for an ( matrix ) operator @xmath11 , let @xmath18 ( and define @xmath19 , @xmath20 for operators @xmath9 , @xmath21 etc . ) .",
    "a ( formally invertible ) gauge transformation @xmath22 , for @xmath23 , defines a mapping @xmath24    consider also the ( formal ) adjoint operator @xmath25 .",
    "( taking the formal adjoint is , as usual , the linear operation defined by @xmath26 for a matrix @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the hermitian conjugate of @xmath27 . ) since @xmath29 , we have @xmath30    by determining the kernel of @xmath25 we obtain some nontrivial solution in @xmath31 . typically , we may identify this subset in terms of @xmath5 and denote a member as @xmath32 .",

    "let @xmath23 and @xmath42 be such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "then we get the mapping @xmath45",
    "the difficulty with this definition of a transformation is that to define it we need one of the solutions we are trying to determine , namely @xmath46 ! to overcome this , we use the fact that there corresponds to @xmath47 a solution @xmath48 and then use the mapping @xmath49 to obtain @xmath50 for any @xmath51 .",

    "then @xmath56 where @xmath57 , is called a _ binary transformation_.    in the next section we will consider two concrete examples of such a binary transformation .",
    "now suppose that the operator @xmath11 has a constraint of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is in some formally invertible ( matrix differential ) operator but this in fact corresponds to two constraints since on taking adjoints @xmath60 . ] .",
    "we wish to find binary transformations that preserve this constraint .",
    "that is  using the notation of the above definition  we want @xmath39 to satisfy the constraint whenever @xmath11 does .",

    "in particular , for each @xmath53 , @xmath72 . hence , in the case of a binary transformation @xmath73 , we may make the choice @xmath74 .",
    "in this section we describe two classes of darboux transformation for general classes of matrix differential operators of arbitrary order .",
    "the first is originally due to matveev@xcite and has also been considered recently by oevel@xcite .",
    "we will present a very simple proof of this result .",
    "the second was found by oevel & rogers in the case of scalar operators in the context of sato theory .",
    "we will derive a more general version here .    in both cases ,",
    "the results are remarkably general .",
    "there is however a serious drawback .",
    "there is , in this general case , absolutely no guarantee that the transformed operator we have the same `` form '' as the original and so only in special cases does one get a transformation that induces an auto - bcklund transformation .",
    "first , consider @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are @xmath78 ( not necessarily constant ) matrices .",
    "let the operator @xmath66 be such that @xmath79g^{-1}.\\ ] ] hence @xmath66 must satisfy @xmath80g^{-1}=\\sum_{i=0}^n ( \\t u_i - u_i)\\d^i.\\ ] ] taking @xmath7 , where @xmath5 is a non - singular @xmath78 matrix , and hence @xmath81 , we get @xmath80g^{-1}=[g , l]\\theta\\d^{-1}\\theta^{-1}= \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i\\d^{i-1}\\theta^{-1},\\ ] ] for some matrices @xmath82 . for @xmath83 , @xmath84 and in order that @xmath66 define a darboux transformation we must have @xmath85 this condition gives @xmath86(\\theta)=0 $ ] i.e. @xmath87 since @xmath88 . hence we only need require that @xmath89 , for some @xmath37-independent matrix @xmath90 .",
    "note that if @xmath91 then for @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "also , @xmath94 and so we may suppose , without loss of generality , that @xmath95 is an ordinary differential operator , then taking @xmath96 is a genuine generalization .",
    "for example , this is exploited in the classical `` discrete eigenvalue adding '' darboux transformation for the time - independent schrdinger operator . ] .",
    "thus we find that @xmath23 .",
    "the second case we consider is @xmath97 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are again @xmath78 matrices .",
    "note that the multiplicative term in @xmath11 and @xmath9 is omitted .",
    "as in the first case , a gauge operator @xmath66 must satisfy @xmath80g^{-1}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\t u_i - u_i.\\ ] ] there are now two simple choices .",
    "first , let @xmath98 , an ( invertible ) @xmath78 matrix",
    ". then @xmath80g^{-1}=\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i\\d^i,\\ ] ] and so @xmath99(\\theta)=g(l(\\theta))=0 $ ] , i.e. @xmath53 .    second , let @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is an invertible @xmath78 matrix",
    ". now @xmath80g^{-1}=[g , l]\\d^{-1}\\rho_x=\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1 } a_i\\d^{i-1}\\rho_x,\\ ] ] and we must have @xmath102 , i.e. @xmath86(\\d^{-1}(\\rho_x))=g(l(\\rho))=0 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath103 , an @xmath37-independent matrix .",
    "again , we may take @xmath95 without loss of generality and so @xmath104 .",
    "as in the scalar case , it is the composition of the two gauge transformations which is of most interest , and we take @xmath105 .",
    "to determine the binary transformations @xmath106 corresponding to the two darboux transformations found above we must determine two additional things : the mapping @xmath107 and then the element @xmath108 in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath109 .",
    "first consider @xmath110 , @xmath33 . here",
    "the condition @xmath111 is satisfied by the choice @xmath112 .",
    "further , @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "it may be shown that for all operators @xmath115 , @xmath116 is exact in the sense that @xmath117@xcite .    in this case",
    "the binary transformation is @xmath118 for discussion of the reduction we will also need @xmath119    now suppose that @xmath11 satisfies the constraint @xmath120 where @xmath121 , a ( not necessarily constant ) matrix",
    ". then we may choose @xmath122 .",
    "the condition @xmath123 now gives @xmath124    this establishes the following theorem .    [ 0 ] let the matrix operator @xmath125 satisfy the constraint @xmath126 where @xmath127 is an hermitian or skew - hermitian matrix .",
    "then the binary transformation @xmath128 where @xmath129 , preserves the above constraint , i.e. @xmath67 satisfies @xmath130 .    for the second case , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and hence @xmath133 .    to determine the binary transformation it is notationally convenient to write an element of @xmath20 as @xmath134 rather than @xmath109 as we did above",
    ". also , it is necessary to introduce two integrals @xmath135 where @xmath136 now @xmath137 and so @xmath138 integrating by parts and taking inverses , we get @xmath139    we may now obtain @xmath140 and in a similar way @xmath141    suppose that @xmath11 satisfies the constraint @xmath120 where @xmath142 , @xmath127 a matrix , and choose @xmath143 , i.e. @xmath144 . the condition @xmath145 is @xmath146 with these conditions on @xmath127 , @xmath147 .",
    "this establishes a second theorem .",
    "[ 1 ] let the matrix operator @xmath131 satisfy the constraint @xmath148 where @xmath127 is an @xmath37-independent hermitian or skew - hermitian matrix .",
    "then the binary transformation @xmath149 where with @xmath150 in the statement of the theorem ] @xmath151 , preserves the above constraint , i.e. @xmath67 satisfies @xmath152 .",
    "this system has lax pair @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 is real .",
    "let @xmath156 .",
    "then @xmath157 hence we may use theorem  [ 0 ] ( with @xmath158 ) to obtain a binary transformation .",
    "this transformation has been used to obtain a wide class of solutions including dromions@xcite .",
    "the equation is a reduction of the bkp equation and so has lax pair admitting the bkp reduction : @xmath159 where @xmath160 we may use theorem  [ 1 ] ( with @xmath158 ) to obtain the binary transformation .",
    "note that this is given by @xmath161 and coincides the with the well - known `` darboux '' transformation .",
    "this system belongs to the two component bkp hierarchy and has a lax pair @xmath162 where @xmath163 , and @xmath164 and @xmath165 are give skew - symmetric and symmetric real matrices respectively .",
    "again @xmath166 and theorem  [ 1 ] gives the binary transformation .",
    "we have discussed the general construction of binary transformations from darboux transformations . in particular we have carried this out for two classes of operators .",
    "more importantly , we have shown that the well studied reductions of these classes ( the multi - component bkp and ckp reductions ) are among those that the binary transformations preserve .",
    "iteration of the binary transformation is , of course , possible and leads to closed - form expressions for solutions  of the linear problems and for the integrable systems that are their compatibility conditions  in terms of ( multi - component ) grammian determinants . in the case of the reduction described in theorem",
    "[ 1 ] , one may see how these grammians are transformed into pfaffians by the reduction process .",
    "these features will be discussed in more details elsewhere@xcite .",
