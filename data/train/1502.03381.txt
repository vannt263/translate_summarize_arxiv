    "solutions of a nonlinear schrdinger equation ;    time dependent wave functions ;    free particles and moshinsky - like potential .",
    "tsallis statistics  @xcite , based on the entropy @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a constant and @xmath1 is a real parameter , has shown to be useful in the description of several systems where the additivity fails such as systems characterized by non ",
    "markovian processes  @xcite , nonergodic dynamics and long  range many  body interactions  @xcite .",
    "the nonadditive characteristic of @xmath7  @xcite has also brought new insights to several works in the area of complex systems  @xcite and contributed to diverse problems of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "recently , nobre , rego - monteiro and tsallis have proposed a nonlinear schrdinger equation  @xcite ( nrt equation ) that admits soliton  like solutions ( @xmath1plane waves ) with possible applications in several areas of physics , including nonlinear optics , superconductivity , plasma physics , and darkmatter .",
    "since the applicability of linear equations in physics is usually restricted to idealized systems  @xcite , the advance in the understanding of real systems makes necessary the use of nonlinear equations several times  @xcite . for a system with particle of mass @xmath8",
    ", the nrt equation can be written as @xmath9 where the scaling constant @xmath10 guarantees the appropriate units for the different physical terms appearing in the equation , @xmath11 is the imaginary unity and @xmath12 is the planck s constant .",
    "an interesting aspect related to this equation is the non  markovian effect emerging from the presence of the nonlinearity , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "a similar situation is found in the porous media equation @xcite , whose solutions may exhibit a short or a long tailed behavior and are connected to anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "this intriguing equation has been the focus of intensive research in recent years  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a family of time dependent wave packet solutions have been also investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , a quasi - stationary solution for the moshinsky model has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a classical field - theoretic approach has been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we study the problem of two particles in the context of the nrt equation focusing on time dependent solutions .",
    "we worked on the case for free particles ( section 2 ) and particles subjected to a time dependent moshinsky - like potential ( section 3 ) . for these situations , we observe that the nonlinearity creates an entanglement between the particles , which is not present in the usual scenario and it is essential for describing physical reality  @xcite inherent to quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in section 4 .",
    "let us start our discussion by considering the @xmath1generalized schrdinger equation for a system of two particles in the absence of potential by assuming @xmath14 and defining @xmath15 without loss of generality . the time dependent moshinsky - like potential is discussed in the next section .",
    "for this case the nrt equation takes the following form @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the particles coordinates .",
    "similarly to the situation worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq.([eq : nrt ] ) has the @xmath1plane wave as solution @xmath19\\otimes_{q}\\exp_{q}\\left[i(k_{2}x_{2}-\\omega_{2}t)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the @xmath1product  @xcite .",
    "this result shows that the nonlinearity of the eq.([eq : nrt ] ) entangled the particles , leading us to different behaviors dependent on @xmath1 ( see fig.([qwavefunction ] ) ) .    ) for two different values of @xmath1 in order to illustrate the entanglement of the particles due to the nonlinearity of the nrt equation ( eq.([eq : nrt ] ) ) . ]",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath21 obtained from the nrt equation does not has a probabilistic interpretation for @xmath22 . in order to recover that probabilistic interpretation",
    ", we could follow the procedures proposed by rego - monteiro and nobre  @xcite , and introduce a second field defined by means of an additional non - linear equation coupled with the nrt equation for @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , recovering the probabilistic interpretation of the nrt equation under the action of an spatial and time dependent potential ( such as the moshinsky - like potential worked out in the next section ) , in contrast with the free particle case , still is an open problem . even in the free particle case , to obtain general time - dependent solutions for the nrt equation represents a cumbersome task due to the intrinsic complexity of @xmath23 that still need to be incorporated in this second equation for obtaining the second field .",
    "for this reason , we have focused our study only on the solutions for the nrt equation , that is , on @xmath23 .",
    "although this simplified approach lacks an exact probabilistic interpretation , for @xmath1 not so far from one we could expected that @xmath21 will keep some information on the probability of find particles in a given position and time ; also , this analysis can provides new insights and a better understating of the nrt equation .    in order to explicit solve eq.([eq : nrt ] ) , we use the @xmath1gaussian package as an ansatz , @xmath24^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are appropriate time dependent coefficients to be found .",
    "the presence of a crossing term in eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) covers a more general scenario characterized by an initial situation of mixing between the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    by substituting ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) in ( [ eq : nrt ] ) , the left and right sides of the nrt equation becomes , @xmath29 and @xmath30 thus , eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) satisfies the nrt equation with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 being solution of the following set of coupled ordinary differential equations : @xmath31    note that there is a relationship between these parameters . by considering the difference @xmath32",
    ", we obtain @xmath33 thus , we can write the following relationship for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "a general analytical solution for this set of equations with arbitrary initial conditions is a hard task ; however , note that any initial state with @xmath36 lead us to @xmath37constant for all later times .",
    "likewise , any initial state with @xmath38 will preserve this symmetry for all later times ( see eq.([eq : parametersrelation ] ) ) .",
    "also , if @xmath36 and @xmath38 , we have the following solutions : @xmath39^{-\\frac{q-1}{2 ( q-2)}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constant that depend on the initial conditions . naturally , it is possible to obtain other numerical and analytical solutions for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 to investigate the behavior of @xmath43 for the cases that we shall present .",
    "let us discuss the case that recovers the linear schrdinger equation for a systems of two entangled free particles . in this case , the set of differential equations for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is @xmath44 considering the difference @xmath32 , eq .",
