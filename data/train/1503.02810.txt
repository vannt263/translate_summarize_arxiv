    "after the discovery of hawking radiation @xcite in 1975 , it was widely anticipated that the semi - classical approach to gravity based on quantum field theory ( qft ) in curved spacetime will open the opportunity to explore various interesting physical problems , in which a quantum field interacts with the curved spacetime where it resides . among these problems , of special interest is the self - consistent dynamical evaporation of a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "another outstanding problem in this class is the evolution of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe , and the resulting cosmological structure formation .",
    "indeed , in the latter problem of cosmological quantum - field perturbations a remarkable progress has been achieved over the last few decades .",
    "@xcite however , the problem of analyzing the semiclassical evolution of an evaporating bh still remains a serious challenge .",
    "to understand the difficulties in analyzing this interesting problem of self - consistent bh evaporation , let us briefly review the basic structure of semiclassical gravity .",
    "the metric @xmath2 is treated as a classical field , and it is assumed to satisfy the _",
    "semiclassical einstein equation _",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the einstein tensor associated with @xmath2 . and the @xmath5 signature . ] the source term @xmath6 is the regularized expectation value of the stress - energy tensor associated with a quantum field @xmath7 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we shall take @xmath8 here to be a scalar field .",
    "it is supposed to satisfy the field equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively denote the mass and coupling constant of the scalar field .",
    "note that the theory is semi - classical , as the field @xmath8 is quantized but the metric @xmath12 is classical , nevertheless the two are coupled .    the major difficulty in solving ( or even analyzing ) the field equation ( [ eq : intro - qft - cst basic eqs ] ) has to do with the regularization of the divergent quantity @xmath13 .",
    "as opposed to qft in flat spacetime in which one can use the normal - ordering procedure , in curved spacetime the outcome of this procedure depends on the choice of time slicing which is completely arbitrary .",
    "there exists a regularization method named _ point - splitting _ ( ps ) , also known as covariant point separation , which gives a general prescription how to regularize quantities which are quadratic in the field and its derivatives such as @xmath13 .",
    "alas , implementing this prescription in situations where the solution of the field equation ( [ eq : field_equation ] ) is known only numerically turns out as a surprisingly difficult problem .    in this paper we shall focus on the regularization of @xmath1 instead of @xmath13 .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 is also divergent , but not as strong as @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the scalar character of @xmath1 ( as opposed to the tensorial @xmath13 ) makes it easier to regularize .",
    "these properties make @xmath1 a convenient tool to examine and explain new ideas concerning regularization . in order to calculate @xmath14 (",
    "i.e. the regularized @xmath15 ) using the ps method we split the point @xmath16 and write it as a product of @xmath8 at two different points , namely @xmath17 .",
    "this is known as the _ two - point function _ ( tpf ) .",
    "we then subtract from the tpf a known _ counter - term _ and take the limit @xmath18 .",
    "this limit , however , is what makes the numerical implementation so hard .    in 1984",
    "candelas and howard @xcite developed a method to numerically implement ps if a high - order wkb approximation for the field modes is known . using this method , they calculated @xmath0 in schwarzschild spacetime , and subsequently this method was used by howard @xcite to calculate @xmath6 in schwarzschild . later",
    ", this method was extended to a general static spherically symmetric background , first for @xmath0 by anderson @xcite , and subsequently to @xmath6 by anderson , hiscock and samuel @xcite .",
    "the limitation of the method proposed by candelas and howard is that it requires a high - order wkb approximation for the field modes : at least second - order for @xmath0 and forth order for @xmath6 . in the ordinary ( lorentzian - signature )",
    "schwarzschild metric this task of high - order wkb expansion is very difficult , especially because of the presence of a turning point : for typical modes of large @xmath19 and @xmath20 , there is a turning point on the @xmath21 axis , at a value @xmath22 where the effective potential @xmath23 equals @xmath24 . and",
    "@xmath20 there are usually _ two _ such roots . here",
    "we shall explicitly refer to the larger one , but the same complications arise also at the smaller root . ]",
    "the mode s radial function is essentially oscillatory at @xmath25 and exponential at @xmath26 . both these basic wkb approximations  the oscillatory approximation at @xmath25 and the exponential approximation at @xmath26  break down and actually diverge at @xmath27 . to correctly match the two approximations",
    ", one has to use another , intermediate approximation valid in the neighborhood of @xmath28 .",
    "this _ turning - point approximation _ is based on the airy function . whereas the leading - order matching is manageable",
    ", it becomes exceedingly hard to go to higher - order wkb , because each succeeding order will now require its own turning - point matching .",
    "furthermore , to the best of our understanding , the series of powers involved in the airy - based turning - point expansion proceeds in powers of @xmath29 ( rather than @xmath30 ) . correspondingly , we may expect that in the presence of a turning point , to implement the wkb - based expansion to order @xmath31 ( required for calculating @xmath6 ) , one would have to carry matched asymptotic expansion up to _ twelfth _ order in @xmath29 ( or six such orders for @xmath0 )  a formidably difficult task .    to overcome these difficulties , candelas and howard @xcite and several others @xcite used an elegant trick : they used wick rotation to analytically extend the background metric to the euclidean sector .",
    "any static spacetime is guaranteed to have such a real - metric euclidean sector .",
    "in the latter , the radial equation does not admit a turning point .",
    "this way , it was possible to carry the wkb analysis to the desired order and to implement the above regularization scheme  for @xmath0 as well as for @xmath6 .    our ultimate goal , however , is to develop a regularization scheme for @xmath1 and @xmath13 , applicable to _ time - dependent _ backgrounds as well .",
    "such a time - dependent metric ( even if spherically symmetric ) does @xmath32 generically admit a euclidean sector .",
    "we are thus led to carry the analysis directly in the lorentzian sector , which in turn implies the presence of a turning point in the radial equation , hampering any attempt to carry high - order wkb expansion .",
    "we shall therefore refrain from establishing our regularization scheme on the wkb analysis .",
    "there is another obvious reason for avoiding wkb analysis : consider a time - dependent spherically - symmetric background .",
    "the field equation for a given mode may still be expressed as a one - dimensional ( namely @xmath33 ) wave equation with an effective potential , but now the potential will be time - dependent .",
    "in such a situation , even the leading - order wkb ( and even if we forget for the moment about the turning point ) becomes a non - trivial task , let alone higher - order wkb analysis .    for these reasons , we shall not base our regularization scheme on high - order wkb expansion .",
    "instead , in our method we extract the required information concerning the high - frequency field s modes directly from the well - known counter - term ( [ eq : basic ps - the counter - terms gds ] ) for @xmath0 ( and , for computing @xmath6 , from the counter - term developed by christensen @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that this approach , namely extraction of the high - frequency asymptotic behavior of the modes from a known local counter - term , was actually initiated by candelas @xcite  already before he and howard resorted to the euclidean sector @xcite .",
    "however , candelas analysis was restricted to the schwarzschild case ( which in particular means restriction to staticity , spherical symmetry , and to vacuum ) . we should also comment that even in that case the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite was not completed , because the required integral of the regularized mode contribution over @xmath19 was not carried out .",
    "when we attempted to implement this integral over @xmath19 , we found that it actually fails to converge in the usual sense , due to growing oscillations ( see below ) , which led us to introduce the notion of generalized integral .",
    "our approach is in this sense a completion of candelas method , as well as its generalization beyond the vacuum case ( and with the scope of further extending it to dynamical backgrounds ) .",
    "our method requires the field modes to admit a trivial decomposition in at least one of the coordinates ( e.g. through @xmath34 or spherical harmonics ) .",
    "this usually corresponds to having a killing field in spacetime .",
    "the splitting is then done in that trivial coordinate  which enables us to treat the coincidence limit analytically .",
    "so far we have developed two different variants of our method : ( i ) the _ @xmath35-splitting _ variant , which requires a time - translation symmetry ; ( ii ) the _ angular - splitting _ variant , which requires spherical symmetry .",
    "we are also exploring a third variant , _ azimuthal splitting _ ( which would only require axial symmetry ) , but this one is still in progress . in all these variants we assume for simplicity that the background is asymptotically - flat , although this requirement can probably be relaxed .    since our ultimate goal is to analyze @xmath6 on the time - dependent background of an evaporating bh , the @xmath35-splitting method is insufficient , and we shall actually need the angular - splitting variant .",
    "it turns out , however , that the @xmath35-splitting variant is in some sense conceptually simpler and easier to present at first stage , because certain additional complications arise in the angular - splitting method .",
    "although we know how to address these complications , they make the method s logical structure a bit more obscure and harder to explain . for this reason , for the sake of introducing our basic regularization strategy",
    "we choose to present here the @xmath35-splitting variant , which is logically simpler . and for exactly the same reason , in this paper we shall display the regularization of @xmath1 rather than @xmath13 . then in the next paper we plan to present the angular - splitting variant , which is going to be our main tool for analyzing dynamical bh evaporation .",
    "the tpf diverges for any pair of points connected by a null geodesic , even if they are far from each other @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , this long - distance divergence of the tpf leads to undamped oscillations in the mode contributions at large @xmath19 . to address this issue we use the concept of _ generalized integral _ , in which these oscillations are properly damped upon integration over @xmath19 , which fully cures the oscillations problem .",
    "the origin of this complication ( the presence of connecting null geodesics ) is discussed in sec . [ sub : remarks - about - the - tpf ] and also in appendix [ sec : appendix - b ] ; and the resolution of the oscillations problem by means of generalized integral ( and particularly the so called `` self - cancellation integral '' ) is described in sec . [ sub : remarks - about - the - tpf ] and further in appendix [ sec : appendix - a ] .    in the description of the @xmath35-splitting method in sec .",
    "[ sec : the - new - scheme ] we assume a spherically - symmetric static background for the sake of simplicity .",
    "however , as was discussed above , the @xmath35-splitting method does not require spherical symmetry , and in principle it may be applied to a generic ( asymptotically - flat ) stationary spacetime .",
    "we outline this generalization of the method to stationary backgrounds in sec . [",
    "sub : our method - non spherical symmetric ] .",
    "we point out , however , that some completion is still required in the case of a stationary eternal bh ( see therein ) .",
    "next we apply our method explicitly to the schwarzschild case , computing @xmath0 in boulware state .",
    "we compare our results to those obtained previously by anderson ( using the euclidean sector ) , and find full agreement .",
    "this article is divided as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic point splitting ] we present the basic ps method , and then briefly outline the procedure developed by candelas and howard @xcite .",
    "note that sec .",
    "[ sub : remarks - about - the - tpf ] discusses certain subtleties of the tpf in some detail , and may be skipped in first reading . in sec .",
    "[ sec : the - new - scheme ] we present our @xmath35-splitting method .",
    "we first describe it for spherically - symmetric static background , and then outline its generalization to a generic stationary background . in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc in schwarzschild ] we harness this method for the calculation of @xmath0 in the schwarzschild metric .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our new method and try to pave the path towards our ultimate goal of investigating self - consistent bh evaporation .",
    "we start by sketching the basic ps regularization method .",
    "this method is aimed to regularize the expectation value of various quantities which are quadratic in the field operator ( and its derivatives ) . among these quantities ,",
    "the most important one is probably the energy - momentum tensor @xmath13 .",
    "however , in this first paper we shall consider @xmath1 as a simpler example ( although we shall occasionally remark on the analogous calculation of @xmath13 ) .    for simplicity",
    "we consider here a quantum scalar field @xmath7 living in a static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat spacetime with metric @xmath36 where @xmath37 . the field operator may then conveniently be expressed as @xmath38 here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the creation and annihilation operators of the field s @xmath41 mode , @xmath42 is a complete , orthonormal , family of modes and @xmath43 is @xmath44 . ]",
    "taking the form    @xmath45    and @xmath46 are the usual spherical harmonics .",
    "the radial functions @xmath47 are obtained by solving the field equation for @xmath7 with the decomposition ( [ eq : basic ps - expression for f ] ) and with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the operation of summation over @xmath48 and integration over @xmath19 repeats many times in the analysis below",
    ". we shall generally refer to this operation as the `` mode sum '' ( despite the slight abuse of terminology ) .",
    "we point out , however , that the decomposition ( [ eq : basic ps - field decomposition to a , ad ] ) applies as - is in the case of an asymptotically - flat background spacetime with simple asymptotic structure ( like e.g. minkowski or a star ) .",
    "but if the background spacetime is an eternal bh with a past horizon , then for each @xmath41 combination there are actually two orthonormal modes , namely the `` in '' and `` up '' modes .",
    "the `` in '' modes are those described above ( namely monochromatic waves propagating from past null infinity ) , and the `` up '' modes describe monochromatic waves that emerge from the past horizon . in this case of eternal bh , the mode sum should also include a summation over the contributions of these two independent modes for each @xmath41 ( as explicitly described in sec . [ sec : calc in schwarzschild ] for the schwarzschild case ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 obviously depends on the quantum state . naturally , one would like to evaluate it in the vacuum state .",
    "the latter is defined to be the quantum state annihilated by each of the above @xmath40 operators .",
    "we shall consider the boulware vacuum state . ]    trying to naively calculate @xmath15 in the vacuum state yields the divergent expression @xmath49 although the sum over @xmath48 does converge for a given @xmath19 , the integral over @xmath19 diverges .",
    "in fact , one can easily check that already in minkowski spacetime the integrand is @xmath50 ( and @xmath51 for @xmath13 ) , and the same divergence occurs in the schwarzschild case as well .",
    "if one tries to integrate over @xmath19 before the summation , one finds that the integral over @xmath19 again diverges ( for a given @xmath52 ) .",
    "one therefore needs to somehow regularize the expression for @xmath1 . in flat spacetime",
    "this regularization may be easily achieved by normal ordering , but in curved spacetime this yields a slicing - dependent , non - unique result .",
    "this is where point splitting comes into play .",
    "dewitt @xcite proposed that @xmath15 ( and , more generally , quantities quadratic in the field operator and its derivatives ) can be treated by taking the product of the field operators in two separate points @xmath53 and then considering the coincidence limit @xmath54 .",

    "@xcite ]      it is not easy to directly implement the point - splitting method , especially because in the cases of interest ( e.g. black hole backgrounds ) the radial functions @xmath68 are only known from numerics .",
    "furthermore , in eq .",

    "this problem was addressed by candelas , howard and later anderson and collaborators ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) a long time ago .",
    "they developed a calculation scheme that allows regularization of @xmath1 or @xmath13 numerically , provided that an analytic approximation for the field is known , up to a sufficiently high order . , and a fourth order approximation to compute @xmath71 . ]    in that scheme , one first analytically constructs the approximate singular piece of the field , which we denote @xmath72 .",
    "it is composed of the contribution of the modes of large @xmath19 and @xmath20 , up to second order in @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( fourth order for @xmath13 ) , which is usually computed using wkb analysis . from this quantity",

    "are well defined .",
    "we denote the second limit by @xmath77 .",
    "this quantity is well - defined and regular , and it is computed analytically by summing / integrating over the wkb expressions for the large @xmath78 modes which comprise @xmath79 . the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "is now expressed as a mode sum , and owing to its regularity the limit may trivially be taken by replacing @xmath63 by @xmath16 .",
    "putting it all together one obtains @xmath80 the mode sum should now converge ( even though it is taken in coincidence ) , owing to the subtraction of the singular piece .    using this method with splitting in the @xmath35 direction , @xmath0 ( as well as @xmath6 )",
    "was calculated for the schwarzschild case @xcite , and later also for a generic static spherically - symmetric spacetime @xcite .    besides the need to numerically compute the various mode functions",
    "@xmath47 , this method also includes a challenging analytical component : it requires a high - order wkb analysis . as was mentioned in the introduction , the presence of a turning point makes this an extremely difficult task . to overcome these difficulties , candelas and howard @xcite and others @xcite actually carried the analysis in the euclidean sector .",
    "the point - splitting method is based on the presumption that the two - point function is well - behaved as long as the two points are separated .",
    "a few caveats are associated to this issue : first , even in flat spacetime , the two - point function diverges when the separation is in a null direction .",
    "let us therefore assume , for the sake of simplicity , that the points are separated in a timelike ( or possibly spacelike ) direction .",
    "the second caveat is that in curved spacetime , assuming that the two points are indeed separated by a timelike geodesic , if the ( proper - time ) distance between @xmath16 and @xmath63 is sufficiently large , there may also be a null geodesic connecting these two points .",
    "for example , consider the schwarzschild spacetime and an approximately - static timelike geodesic @xmath81 located in the asymptotic region very far from the bh .",
    "let @xmath16 be a point on @xmath81 .",
    "there is a null geodesic which emanates from @xmath16 and moves towards the bh ( but with an appropriate miss ) , makes a turn around the bh , then returns to @xmath81 and hits it at a point @xmath82 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath17 develops a singularity at @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "in fact , along the timelike geodesic @xmath81 there is an infinite discrete set of points",
    "@xmath84 which are connected to @xmath16 by null geodesics that make @xmath85 turns around the bh before returning to @xmath81 , and @xmath17 diverges at all points @xmath86 .",
    "note , however , that the problematic points @xmath84 are all located far away from @xmath16 , outside the normal neighborhood ; and for the point - splitting procedure only points @xmath63 in the immediate neighborhood of @xmath16 are relevant .",
    "we shall thus restrict our attention now to points @xmath63 in the close neighborhood of @xmath16 , with a timelike ( or alternatively spacelike ) separation between @xmath16 and @xmath63",
    ". then the tpf should be well - behaved .",
    "naively one might expect that since the tpf is well behaved for a short timelike or spacelike separation , the mode sum associated to it should converge .",
    "it turns out , however , that the situation is more subtle : the involved sum / integral usually fails to converge ( in the literal sense ) .",
    "typically this failure to converge is associated with undamped oscillations .",
    "this phenomenon , the failure of strict convergence , occurs already in flat spacetime .",
    "the ( non- ) convergence situation may depend on the direction of splitting , on the order of operations ( summation over @xmath52 and integration over @xmath19 ) , and on the specific quantity being calculated ( whether it is the tpf , or a component of @xmath13 ) . as an example , consider the calculation of @xmath17 in minkowski spacetime , using standard mode decomposition in spherical harmonics and temporal modes @xmath34 .",
    "the mode functions are given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the bessel function of the first kind .",
    "consider now a point @xmath16 located at some @xmath89 , and a point @xmath63 displaced in the @xmath35 direction by an amount @xmath90 the sum over @xmath52 ( for a given @xmath19 ) then converges , and one finds that @xmath91 the mode - sum expression for the tpf then becomes @xmath92 the problem is that this integral does not converge in the usual sense ( even conditionally ) , due to the growing oscillations at large @xmath19 .    in this example of pure @xmath35-splitting ,",
    "in which we first sum over @xmath48 , it was the integral over @xmath19 that failed to converge .",
    "in another application of point splitting , in which the splitting is in both @xmath35 and @xmath93 , and in which one first integrates over @xmath19 and sums over @xmath48 afterward , one finds that this time the sum over @xmath20 fails to converge , again due to growing oscillations .",

    "this situation , of non - converging oscillatory integrals ( or sums over @xmath20 ) , is fairly common in various qft calculations .",
    "the common practice ( which may be justified by several arguments ) is to contend that the large-@xmath19 oscillations should be damped in some appropriate manner .",
    "this situation motivates us to introduce the notion of generalized integral , which properly incorporates oscillation damping .",
    "we should emphasize that all the @xmath19 integrals in this paper are in fact generalized integrals .",

    "[ fig:1a ] )  but not to oscillations ; and this linear singularity is no longer present in @xmath141 .",
    "the oscillations in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] must then indicate another singularity , located at some point @xmath263 . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider for example the delta - function case : the fourier transform of @xmath264 is @xmath265 .",
    "it is oscillatory if and only if @xmath266 . the frequency of the @xmath19-oscillations is just @xmath267  namely , it directly tells us the distance of the singularity from the point @xmath268 .",
    "one more example is the singularity @xmath269 , whose transform is @xmath270 . but",
    "this phenomenon is of course more general : if a certain function @xmath271 admits a fourier transform @xmath272 , then the transform of @xmath273 is @xmath274 .",
    "the oscillations seen in e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] have a certain `` @xmath19-wavelength '' @xmath275 ( in units in which the bh mass is @xmath196 ) .",
    "they must therefore correspond to a singularity in the tpf , located at a distance @xmath276 from point @xmath16 .",
    "what is the nature of this non - local singularity of the tpf ?",
    "as already pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sub : remarks - about - the - tpf ] , the function @xmath17 admits a singularity whenever a null geodesic exists which connects @xmath16 and @xmath63 . in the present context of schwarzschild background and @xmath35-splitting",
    ", we are dealing here with a null geodesic which emanates from a certain spatial point @xmath277 , makes a round trip around the bh , and then returns to that same spatial point , but obviously with a certain delay in @xmath35  which should correspond to the shift parameter @xmath267 .",
    "in fact there is not only one but an _ infinite , _ discrete set of such connecting null geodesics ( for each @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is because a null geodesic emanating from a spatial point @xmath277 can make any integer number of revolutions around the bh before returning to that spatial point .",
    "therefore , the tpf will actually admit an infinite number of singular points at a discrete set of values @xmath278 , one for each integer @xmath85 .    correspondingly , there will be a discrete spectrum of oscillation modes in @xmath141 , with ( @xmath21-dependent ) @xmath19-frequencies @xmath279 and corresponding wavelengths @xmath280 .",
    "we point out , however , that the dominant mode is always @xmath281 , and the oscillation s amplitude quickly decays with @xmath85 ( see next subsection ) .    to perform the self - cancellation of oscillations",
    ", we shall need to know the spectrum of frequencies @xmath279 , at any desired @xmath21 value .",
    "this requires integration of the null geodesic equation , to find the connecting null geodesics .",
    "for @xmath282 the situation is especially simple , because in that case the connecting null geodesic is circular .",
    "one then finds that @xmath283 . at",
    "other @xmath21 values the spectrum becomes more complicated , and needs to be calculated numerically .",
    "the null orbits in schwarzschild are characterized by a single constant of motion , namely the angular momentum per unit energy ( or the `` impact parameter '' ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath279 involves ( i ) numerical integration of the null geodesic equation ( for prescribed values of that constant of motion ) , and ( ii ) using the newton - raphson method for adjusting this constant , in order to find the connecting geodesics , which return to the original spatial point after @xmath85 rounds .",
    "the required parameters @xmath279 are the @xmath35-duration of these connecting null geodesics .",
    "overall , this is an easy numerical procedure .    in our representative case @xmath284",
    ", the first few oscillation frequencies are found to be @xmath285 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] we predominantly see the basic oscillation @xmath281 , and the frequency agrees very well with this value of @xmath286 .",
    "we can also notice the residual effect of the @xmath287 oscillation , which causes the small distortion ( i.e. small deviation from the smooth @xmath288 envelope ) in the pattern of peaks of @xmath141 , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] .",
    "after the basic oscillation @xmath281 is removed by self - cancellation , the next one ( @xmath287 ) dominates and becomes very clear , and again , its frequency is found to agree very well with the above value of @xmath289 . by this procedure",
    "it is possible to expose a few more modes , and to confirm their agreement with the above @xmath279 values , that were obtained from the connecting null geodesics .",
    "as was already mentioned above , for @xmath282 the frequencies @xmath279 form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference @xmath290 . for other @xmath21 values",
    "this is no longer the case .",
    "still , the difference @xmath291 quickly approach the standard spacing @xmath292 .",
    "for example , from the four @xmath279 values specified above for the @xmath284 case , one sees that @xmath293 , and then @xmath294 . this is simply because for any @xmath21 , a connecting null geodesic with large @xmath85 makes most of the revolutions around the bh along an orbit very close to the circle @xmath282 .",
    "the numerical data indicate that the oscillation s amplitude grows as @xmath202 .",
    "this in turn implies that the divergence of the tpf at @xmath295 should be @xmath296 .",
    "we shall not address this issue here in detail , but we point out that this @xmath297 power is just what one would expect from simple arguments . to this end",
    "one has to recall that since the background is spherically symmetric , and since the splitting is only in the @xmath35 direction ( implying that @xmath298 and @xmath299 ) , whenever @xmath63 is located on a null geodesic emanating from @xmath16 , it is placed _",
    "exactly _ at a _ caustic point _ of that null geodesic .",
    "qualitative arguments suggest that on crossing such a caustic point , the tpf should indeed diverge as @xmath300 .",
    "but the discussion of this issue is far beyond our present scope .",
    "the @xmath301 oscillations , too , grow as @xmath202 at large @xmath19 ( the numerics confirms this , at least for the first few @xmath85 values ) .",
    "this is for the same reason as that described above for @xmath281 .",
    "we thus express the large-@xmath19 amplitudes of the various @xmath279 modes as @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is a set of ( @xmath21-dependent ) amplitude parameters .",
    "it is important to explore how @xmath303 behaves with increasing @xmath85 , in order to control the possible effect of the infinite number of oscillating modes .",
    "the simplest case to analyze is again @xmath282 , because the connecting null geodesic is then the circular geodesic at @xmath282 .",
    "simple analytical considerations suggest that in this case @xmath303 should form an almost - exact geometric sequence with @xmath304 .",
    "geodesic , suggests that in this case @xmath303 should be exactly proportional to @xmath305^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "this expression deviates from the geometric sequence @xmath306 by a tiny relative amount @xmath307 . this deviation is smaller than one part in @xmath308 even for @xmath281 , too small to be detected by our numerics , but nevertheless our numerical results are fully consistent with that expression .",
    "] our numerical results for @xmath309 allows reliable evaluation of the first three amplitudes , and the calculated ratios @xmath310 and @xmath311 agree very well with @xmath312 , to about one part in @xmath211 .",
    "( for the @xmath313 modes the oscillations are too weak to reliably measure their @xmath303 . )    for other @xmath21 values the situation is more complicated , and we do not expect to find such a well - approximated geometric sequence ; yet , we still expect that as @xmath85 increases , @xmath314 should quickly approach the above `` canonical '' value @xmath312 .",
    "the reason is that , for large @xmath85 , the connecting null geodesic makes most of the @xmath85 revolutions around the bh along an orbit very close to the circle @xmath282 .",
    "hence , the decrease in the van - vleck determinant at each revolution is approximately the same as in the analogous @xmath282 case ( an approximation that ever improves with increasing @xmath85 ) . at",
    "very small @xmath85 , however , the ratio between two successive amplitudes may slightly differ from @xmath312 .",
    "we numerically find that the ratio @xmath310 ranges from @xmath315 at @xmath282 to @xmath316 at @xmath317 .",
    "overall , at least in the range @xmath318 that we have numerically explored , the numerical data as well as the theoretical considerations are all consistent with an almost - geometric sequence ( even for small @xmath85 ) , with @xmath314 ranging between @xmath319 and @xmath320 . in turn",
    "this implies that for practical computation of the generalized integral of @xmath141 , we shall have to cancel the first few @xmath85 modes , but the contribution of large-@xmath85 modes may be neglected .",
    "we self - cancel the first four frequencies @xmath321 .",
    "the higher modes @xmath322 are too weak to notice . for _ any _ @xmath85 , because after all we only integrate along a finite interval of @xmath19 [ which is in turn allowed due to the fast convergence of @xmath209 ] , and because of the fast decay of @xmath303 with @xmath85 , the large-@xmath85 oscillation terms do not have any noticeable effect on the integral . ]",
    "the values of the frequencies @xmath279 are numerically obtained from the connecting null geodesics , for any desired @xmath21 , as explained above .",
    "the corresponding wavelengths are then given by @xmath280 .",
    "for each frequency , we apply a fourth - order self - cancellation .",
    "thus , in the terminology of eq .",
