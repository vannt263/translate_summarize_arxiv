    "numerical schemes , which is using for solving systems of equations of many - particle dynamics , can have restrictions on a step and an interval of integration because if they increase , the numerical schemes become unstable and do not conserve integrals of motion . as a result , when we simulate many - particle system behaviour on the sufficiently large time interval we should decrease an integration step , which leads to considerable increasing of computation quantity .",
    "a motion of @xmath0-particle system in a field with potential @xmath1 can be described by the system of hamiltonian equations @xcite @xmath2 with initial conditions @xmath3 .    here",

    "an approach to design of conservative difference scheme for solving hamiltonian equations ( [ heq ] ) is based on following stages .",
    "first is a choice of appropriate type of generating function @xmath9 , which fixes a definite family of simplectic difference scheme @xcite .",
    "simplectic difference scheme corresponds to the canonical transformation of canonical variables @xcite .",
    "solution of hamiltonian system ( [ heq ] ) for a definite time moment can be represented as canonical transformation and that is why conserves the value of hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "second is using of `` forward '' and `` backward '' taylor expansion of coordinate and momentum on a time step for getting of a corresponding generating function and remaining values of coordinate and momentum .",

    "a new approach for constructing symmetric simplectic numerical schemes for solving hamiltonian systems of equations is proposed .",
    "the numerical schemes constructed by this approach produce more stable and accurate solution of hamiltonian system ( 1 ) and better conserve the energy of a system on the large interval of numerical integration for a relatively large integration step in comparision with the verlet method , which is usually using for solving equations of motion in molecular dynamics .",
