    "as the mechanical properties of dna play an important role in its biological capacities , there has been much activity to accurately characterize these properties , not only in the elastic regime of small to moderate fluctuations but also for more strongly stressed systems .",
    "for example , dna is found to overstretch beyond a salt - dependent critical force @xcite .",
    "similarly , in response to twist dna forms plectonemes beyond a critical buckling superhelical density @xcite . here , we are interested in the response of dna to strong bending .",
    "the worm - like chain ( wlc ) model provides a good description of small to moderate bending fluctuations in dna @xcite .",
    "however , although there is a consensus that for sufficiently strong bending the stress will be localized within small regions , often termed `` kinks '' , much about this crossover to non - wlc behaviour remains controversial .",
    "for example , a recent review by vologodskii _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite highlighted a number of open questions , including what is the free energy cost of kink formation , how does the free - energy of a kink depend on bend angle , what is the critical curvature that causes the double helix to kink ?",
    "one way to address these questions is with molecular simulations of a coarse - grained dna model , as such simulations are able to directly probe the relevant factors . in this and an accompanying paper @xcite we have begun this task for the oxdna model @xcite , which is able to describe well the thermodynamics of dna hybridization and basic mechanical properties such as the persistence length and the torsional modulus @xcite and which has been productively applied to study a wide variety of biophysical and nanotechnological systems @xcite . in the first paper , we addressed the thermodynamics of kink formation and one particular experimental system , a `` molecular vice '' @xcite , that probed dna strong bending . here",
    ", we consider dna cyclization , in particular looking at the length of dna molecules at which duplex kinking begins to play a role in this process .",
    "dna cyclization is a convenient model system used to probe dna bending .",
    "cyclization experiments were first reported in 1966 , albeit on 48500 base pair ( bp ) @xmath1-dna @xcite . in 1981 , shore _",
    "_ developed a method to probe the bending of shorter fragments @xcite , later noting periodicity in the cyclization efficiency of fragments @xcite .",
    "more recently , there has been a particular interest in probing the cyclization of sub - persistence length dna , to explore whether this regime is accurately described by the wlc model .",
    "for example , in 2004 cloutier & widom ( c&w ) @xcite challenged the conventional wisdom of wlc flexibility established by shore _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite , claiming much greater than predicted cyclization efficiency in dna fragments .",
    "this controversial finding spurred debate on the characteristic length at which dna cyclization efficiency deviates from the predictions of the wlc model . despite much experimental @xcite and theoretical effort @xcite ,",
    "a consensus has not yet been established .    a typical cyclization experiment , as depicted in ( a ) , uses a cyclization substrate with complementary sticky ends , @xmath2 bases in length , on both ends of a @xmath3 base - pair duplex .",
    "cyclization leads to the formation of a @xmath4-base - pair duplex , where @xmath5 .",
    "the resultant structure is not a closed minicircle  two backbone ` nicks ' are present at either end of the sticky ends . either the forward rate or equilibrium constant of the cyclization reaction is reported .",
    "experiments differ in how exactly they probe cyclization : methods based on ligation @xcite , fret @xcite and multimerization @xcite have been reported .",
    "and @xmath6 are the forward and reverse rate constants respectively , and * ( b ) * dimerization where the rate constants are @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "note that for the dimerization system there is only one complementary sticky end per monomer , the other end being blunt to allow for only one reaction product , a linear dimer .",
    "figures are oxdna representations for monomers of length @xmath9 , including complementary sticky ends of length @xmath10 .",
    "( dimer length is @xmath11 ) . ,",
    "width=321 ]    in ligase - based experiments , cyclized molecules are fixed in the cyclized state by ligation of the two backbone nicks .",
    "the open and ligated cyclized molecules can then be resolved by gel electrophoresis and the concentration of different products measured .",
    "fret - based experiments can be performed in equilibrium , with the molecules allowed to cyclize and uncyclize indefinitely .",
    "fluorophores are attached to both ends of the molecule as fret reporters : a high fret signal will be reported when the duplex ends are in close proximity ( cyclized ) , low fret when apart ( open ) .",
    "although non - wlc behaviour has been suggested by the ligase - based experiments of c&w @xcite and the fret - based experiments of vafabakhsh & ha ( v&h ) @xcite , these results have been contested @xcite .",
    "there is not yet a consensus on their interpretation .",
    "cyclization efficiency is traditionally reported in terms of a @xmath0-factor , first introduced by jacobson & stockmayer @xcite , which is a measure of the effective local concentration of duplex ends at zero end - to - end separation .",
    "the @xmath0-factor enables the ring closure probability to be calculated , and importantly , may be related to a ratio of equilibrium constants : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the equilibrium constants for cyclization and dimerization , respectively .",
    "multimerization of the cyclization substrate yields a mixture of linear and circular products @xcite . to avoid this complication ,",
    "a separate dimerization substrate may be prepared with the same sequence as the cyclization substrate , but with only one @xmath2-base complementary sticky end per molecule @xcite ( ( b ) ) .",
    "following hybridization , the total length of the system is then @xmath15 base pairs , with blunt as opposed to sticky ends .",
    "the consequences of this choice for @xmath14 and hence @xmath16 are discussed in supplementary .    by assuming the contribution from base pairing to @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the same , the wlc model can be used to estimate @xmath16 .",
    "a common assumption is that the cyclized state is fully stacked , with coaxial stacking across the two nicks .",
    "for this situation , the analytic expression derived by shimada & yamakawa",
    "( sy ) @xcite , which includes both the bending energy cost of bringing the two ends together and the twist energy cost of bringing the two helix ends into register , is the most appropriate .    some of the confusion surrounding claims of cyclization efficiency greater than that predicted by the wlc model revolves around the use and interpretation of @xmath0-factors .",
    "while the @xmath0-factor relation using the ratio of cyclization to dimerization equilibrium constants is well established , experimental studies usually report the ratio of forward rate constants . in the case of ligase - based assays ( reviewed in reference @xcite ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the forward rate constants for the formation of the _ ligated _ circle and dimer , respectively .    in the experimental limit where the ligation rate is very slow compared to the rate constants for uncyclization ( @xmath6 ) and undimerization ( @xmath8 ) , the concentrations of unligated circles and dimers will reach an equilibrium with reactants .",
    "if this condition is met , @xmath20 should be equivalent to @xmath16 . in practice",
    ", this limit is valid for low ligase concentrations ( @xmath21 } \\ll \\ce{[dna]}$ ] ) and short sticky ends @xcite .",
    "the importance of this condition is illustrated by du _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite , who suggested that the apparent non - wlc behaviour in the c&w experiments was rather due to an insufficiently low ligase concentration ( reviewed in reference @xcite ) .",
    "an additional complication with ligase experiments relates to the structure of the substrate , specifically the dna surrounding the nick .",
    "it is unclear whether the ligase will act equally on all nicked duplexes , or only the subset that happen to adopt the right configuration at the nick , be that coaxially stacked or kinked , to allow the ligase to bind . as we show in this work , to alleviate stress , cyclized systems are more likely than dimers to break coaxial stacking at a nick",
    ". the ligation rate of hybridized complementary sticky ends may therefore vary substantially depending on the system .",
    "the fret experiments of v&h @xcite have the advantage of directly monitoring the transition between cyclized and open states . while it is possible to report thermodynamics from fret experiments , v&h report dynamics : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath7 are the forward rate constants for the formation of the _ unligated _ circle and dimer , respectively .",
    "dynamic @xmath0-factors extracted from fret - based experiments must also be interpreted with care . making a comparison between @xmath24 and the sy prediction for @xmath25 , v&h",
    "make a claim of much greater than wlc flexibility at @xmath26 .",
    "however , @xmath27 only in the limit where @xmath28 , a condition that v&h , as well as another more recent fret experiment @xcite , have shown not to be met . given that @xmath29 , one should not expect @xmath27 at short @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the observed deviation of @xmath24 from @xmath25 is not necessarily an indication of non - wlc behaviour .",
    "the interpretation of cyclization experiments is not straightforward ; in particular , the microscopic states , responsible for the putative non - wlc flexibility , can not be directly observed .",
    "additionally , non - wlc behaviour has been reported in a number of other systems , including dna minicircles @xcite , a `` molecular vice '' @xcite , and a `` strained duplex '' @xcite . as we emphasised in the accompanying paper @xcite , establishing whether these observations are mutually consistent is a challenging task due to the distinct interplay of mechanics , geometry and topology inherent in each experimental system .",
    "fortunately , simulation can help bridge this gap .",
    "models that reproduce the basic mechanical , structural and thermodynamic properties of dna can be used to simulate the relevant systems .",
    "the results can be used to establish : ( i ) whether experimental results are truly indicative of non - wlc behaviour ; ( ii ) whether the behaviour can be attributed to certain types of structure , such as ` kinks ' @xcite ; ( iii ) whether different systems present consistent evidence for non - wlc behaviour ; and ( iv ) whether the inferred occurrence of any disruptions to duplex structure is consistent with our current understanding of dna thermodynamics .    here",
    "we use oxdna to probe the cyclization equilibrium as a function of duplex length .",
    "this approach provides direct access to microscopic states , enabling a structural interpretation of experimental observations .",
    "oxdna is particularly well - suited to this task , as it provides a good description of both single- and double - stranded dna , including hybridization thermodynamics , persistence length , torsional modulus and basic structure , and has previously been shown to reproduce a number of stress - induced transitions in dna @xcite .",
    "oxdna @xcite is a nucleotide - level coarse - grained model of dna that has been employed successfully for a wide variety of systems @xcite , beginning with the thermodynamic and structural characterization of dna nanotweezers @xcite .",
    "briefly , the model consists of rigid nucleotides with three interaction sites per nucleotide , interacting via watson - crick base pairing , base stacking , excluded volume , and a potential to represent backbone connectivity .",
    "the model is parameterized to reproduce the thermodynamics of duplex melting at high - salt ( ) , where backbone - backbone electrostatic repulsion is short - ranged due to counter - ion screening .",
    "two parameterizations of the model are available .",
    "we use the the average - base parameterization @xcite , in which the strength of the base - pairing and stacking interactions are independent of the identity of the bases , to highlight the basic thermodynamics of dna cyclization .",
    "by contrast , the sequence - dependent parameterization @xcite has stacking and base - pairing interactions that depend on the base identity and is used to compare more directly to the v&h experiments .      simulations of the cyclization equilibrium were performed with a virtual - move monte carlo ( vmmc ) algorithm @xcite at .",
    "as the free - energy barrier between typical open and cyclized states is large , the transition between the two macrostates constitutes a rare - event .",
    "umbrella sampling , a technique that allows for the biased sampling of states with respect to an order parameter @xcite , was employed to sample the barrier crossing in reasonable computational time .",
    "we use a two - dimensional order parameter @xmath30 to characterize the transition .",
    "@xmath31 is a discretized measure of the distance of closest approach between the complementary sticky ends .",
    "@xmath32 is the number of base pairs formed between complementary sticky ends , where @xmath33 .    to further improve computational efficiency , umbrella sampling was windowed to separately sample the open and cyclized states of each molecule . for the window associated with the open state ,",
    "the system was restricted to @xmath34 ; for the window associated with the cyclized state , the system was restricted to @xmath35 ( the value corresponding to the shortest distances between sticky ends ) .",
    "simulations were run until convergence to within @xmath36 for each window .",
    "the sampling windows overlap at @xmath37 ; results were combined by normalizing each window so that the free energies were equal for this value of the order parameter . as there is only one well - defined overlap between the values of the order parameters for both windows ,",
    "more complex approaches , such as the weighted histogram analysis method @xcite , were unnecessary . to further simplify sampling",
    ", we forbade the formation of base pairs that are not intended in the design of the system ( non - native base pairs ) .",
    "further details of the cyclization simulations can be found in supplementary .",
    "the simulation of dimerization equilibrium is roughly analogous to cyclization , and is elaborated in supplementary . to compute the equilibrium constants , we deemed all states with @xmath38 to contribute to the cyclized and dimerized states ( details in ) .",
    "a complete list of sequences is available in .",
    "error bars represent the standard error of the mean from 5 independent simulations .      for sufficiently strong bending stress ,",
    "localized structural disruptions to the dna double - helical structure are expected .",
    "we define three such disruptions , namely fraying , bubble formation and kinking , which are elaborated in detail in the accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "briefly , both fraying and bubble formation involve the breaking of base pairs ; the difference is in the location along the duplex .",
    "fraying involves disruption of base pairing at the duplex ends , while bubbles occur in otherwise fully base - paired contiguous stretches away from the duplex ends .",
    "conceptually , a kink is an area of strong bending localized to a small segment of dna , and can occur both at a nick and within the duplex .",
    "when kinking occurs in a duplex region , it is nearly always accompanied by bubble formation .",
    "similarly , kinking at a nick can be accompanied by fraying .",
    "we do not attempt to distinguish different types of kinks , as has been done when analysing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "instead , we simply define a kink as present within a duplex region when there is a change in orientation of consecutive bases of greater than 90@xmath39 on either strand . for nicked regions ,",
    "only consecutive bases on the intact ( unnicked ) strand are considered .",
    "although this cutoff is somewhat arbitrary , since in the current system , kinks arise to localize bending stress , they are usually very sharply bent and the criterion works well @xcite . sometimes , however , it gives rise to false negatives , particularly in the case of kinks at nick sites , and when fraying is present .",
    "nonetheless , it is satisfactory as an indicator of behaviour for our purposes .",
    "more details , along with subtleties related to kinking at a nick , are discussed in supplementary .",
    "we simulate a large range of system sizes ; some illustrative configurations are shown in .",
    "quantitatively , we first consider the behaviour of @xmath16 as a function of length . for the dimerization system we only computed the equilibrium constant @xmath14 for a few lengths ( monomers @xmath40 ) .",
    "as expected , we found @xmath14 to be length - independent to within numerical error ( supplementary , ) ; therefore , we use an average value of @xmath41 in our @xmath0-factor calculation . in contrast",
    ", we found @xmath13 , and thereby @xmath16 ( ) , to vary substantially with length .    in",
    ", we show @xmath42 values , calculated from our measured values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 using , for 81 different lengths in the range @xmath43 for fixed @xmath44 using the average - base parameterization of oxdna .",
    "these results are compared to @xmath25 predictions based on the shimada & yamakawa ( sy ) expression @xcite using previously calculated values for the relevant structural and mechanical properties of oxdna @xcite .",
    "the sy expression is appropriate for the formation of a fully stacked `` circle '' configuration with coaxial stacking at both nicks ( ( a ) ) .",
    "note that the comparison in is fit - free .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath2 as well as the role of nicks and mismatches are discussed in supplementary .",
    "the behaviour of the sy expression is well understood . in the regime of interest",
    ", shortening @xmath4 tends to make cyclization less favourable as a result of increased bending stress within the duplex .",
    "this effect becomes particularly acute for dna lengths below the persistence length ( / for the curve plotted in ) . on top of this systematic behaviour",
    ", a periodic oscillation is associated with the need to over- or under - twist the duplex when the natural twist is not commensurate with that required to form a closed circle .",
    "the magnitude of this oscillation increases at shorter @xmath4 because a stronger twist per base pair is required .    when considering the behaviour of @xmath42 in light of the sy expression , three length - scale dependent regimes become apparent : long ( @xmath45 ) , intermediate ( @xmath46 ) and short ( @xmath47 ) .    in the long length regime ( @xmath45 )",
    ", oxdna reproduces the periodic oscillations predicted by the sy expression , and values of @xmath16 coincide at the maxima of these oscillations .",
    "however , even at the longest lengths we consider , the magnitude of the oscillation is smaller for oxdna than predicted by the sy expression . at shorter",
    "@xmath4 , the magnitude of the oscillation decreases for oxdna , at odds with the sy expression .",
    "the difference stems from the possibility of adopting alternative `` teardrop '' configurations ( ( b ) ) , in which most of the twisting stress , and some of the bending stress , can be relieved by kinking at one of the nicks , thus breaking coaxial stacking . in these configurations",
    "there is still the constraint of dna continuity at the nick and this can now be more easily satisfied , rather than through over- or undertwist , by out - of - plane bending ( ( d ) ) .",
    "the possibility of adopting this alternative teardrop configuration reduces the free - energy penalty for incommensurate values of @xmath4 ( i.e.@xmath48 ) , thus suppressing the oscillations .",
    "further , at shorter @xmath4 , the bending stress increases more slowly for these kinked teardrop configurations than for the coaxially stacked circles .",
    "thus , the difference in @xmath16 between the `` on - register '' ( coaxially stacked ) and `` off - register '' ( kinked at a nick ) molecules decreases at shorter @xmath4 , rather than increasing as predicted by the sy model . although not taken into account for most analyses of cyclization , the possibility of the cyclized molecule exhibiting a `` teardrop '' configuration has previously been suggested by vologodskii _",

    "@xcite .     as a function of length @xmath4 , in the duplex , at either nick and at both nicks . *",
    "( b ) * probability of broken base pairs @xmath49 as a function of length @xmath4 for fraying ( base - pairing disruption at either nick ) and bubble formation ( base - pairing disruption in the duplex region ) .",
    ", width=321 ]    further evidence in support of this analysis is given in ( a ) , which shows the probability of kinking as a function of @xmath4 . at long lengths ( @xmath45 )",
    ", kinking does not occur in the duplex regions , but can occur at the nick sites .",
    "there is clear periodicity in kinking at a nick .",
    "for example , at @xmath50 , the probability of kinking at either of the nicks is negligible and the system virtually always adopts a coaxially stacked circle configuration ; however , at the longer @xmath51 , the probability is @xmath52 .",
    "as @xmath4 is shortened , the probability of kinking at a nick gradually increases for these `` off - register '' lengths ; it is not until @xmath53 that the bending stress along the duplex is sufficient to cause @xmath54 of molecules to kink at a nick for an `` on - register '' length .    in the intermediate - length regime ( @xmath46 ) , we observe enhanced cyclization efficiency compared to the sy prediction . although @xmath42 continues to decrease with @xmath4 , it does so more gradually than the sy expression would predict ; consequently , @xmath42 is in excess of the peak envelope of the sy expression . in this regime ,",
    "bending stress in the circular coaxially stacked configuration is sufficiently large that kinking at one of the nicks occurs for even the on - register systems ( ( a ) ) .",
    "oscillations due to on - register effects also seem to contribute to @xmath42 in the upper end of the intermediate - length regime , with shallow maxima occurring at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , approximately 6 and 7 times the pitch length .",
    "however , these sizes no longer correspond to minima in the probability of kinking at a nick ( ( a ) ) so the structural underpinnings of these variations is less clear . for shorter lengths , although there are size - dependent variations in @xmath42 ( e.g.  maxima at @xmath57 and 49 ) , there is no longer a simple relationship to the pitch length , instead reflecting more complex geometric compatibilities that allow cyclized states at these lengths to be particularly stable compared to nearby lengths .    in the intermediate regime ,",
    "most cyclized molecules are kinked at one of the two nicks . at",
    "shorter @xmath4 , the bending stress in the duplex region of the teardrop configurations increases , with the highest curvature being localized opposite the nick that is kinked .",
    "consequently , it becomes increasingly favourable to localize bending stress into a kink in the duplex ( unnicked ) region , with the probability of this duplex kinking ( ( e ) ) increasing from near zero at @xmath58 to near one at @xmath59 ( ( a ) ) .",
    "a kink in the duplex will generally be located opposite a kink at a nick because this arrangement minimizes the residual bending stress in the unkinked portions of the duplex by equalizing the lengths of the double - helical segments between the two kinks .",
    "in addition to a loss of stacking , kinking in the duplex typically involves breaking base pairs @xcite .",
    "a typical configuration for such a kinked duplex state is shown in ( e ) . as with kinking at the nick",
    ", the availability of this configuration lowers the free - energy cost of cyclization , raising @xmath42 further above the sy prediction .    at the lower end of the intermediate - length regime ,",
    "the cost of bending without kinking in the duplex region is so high that molecules with duplex kinking dominate the cyclized state .",
    "states with two kinks localize the majority of the bending stress at the kinking sites , as shown in ( e ) , with long duplex sections relatively relaxed .",
    "consequently , the free - energy cost of looping is largely independent of @xmath4 in this regime , causing @xmath42 to level off and reach an approximately constant value .",
    "in contrast , the sy @xmath25 prediction decreases very rapidly .",
    "for example , at @xmath59 , @xmath42 is @xmath60 times greater than the sy prediction",
    ".    there exists a rich landscape of structures informed by slight differences in local geometries as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to the canonical two - kink structures , containing one kink in the duplex and one kink at a nick ( ( e ) ) , we observe several non - trivial arrangements , albeit with relatively low probability .",
    "for example , the configuration in ( f ) contains a kink at both nicks as well as in the duplex .    in the short - length regime ( @xmath61 )",
    ", we observe an increase in @xmath42 , in stark contrast to the rapidly decreasing @xmath25 predicted by the sy expression .",
    "given the many wlc assumptions that are violated at this length scale , a deviation is unsurprising ; however , we did not anticipate an increase in @xmath42 .    as @xmath3 is now not that much larger than @xmath2",
    ", kinking at both nicks allows the single - stranded sticky ends to hybridize without duplex kinking .",
    "the system now generally adopts a conformation of two parallel duplexes , with the stress now borne by a mixture of continuous bending ( ( g ) ) and fraying of a few base pairs at the ends of the duplexes ( ( h ) ) .",
    "( a ) shows a very clear crossover to cyclized states with kinks at both nicks and no kinks present in the duplex , occurring abruptly at @xmath62 . at the same time , fraying at the duplex ends also increases ( ( b ) ) . in this regime ,",
    "as @xmath4 is shortened , the difference in length of the duplexes decreases and the stress in the system tends to drop , leading to higher @xmath16 ( ) . overlaid on this overall trend are non - trivial geometric effects associated with whether the lengths of the two duplexes relative to the pitch length is convenient for connecting them ( the thickness of the double helix is now significant compared to the duplex lengths ) , which leads to non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath16 and kinking .",
    "note that the value of @xmath4 at the crossover between the short- and intermediate - length regimes is expected to be very dependent on @xmath2 , occurring at smaller @xmath4 for smaller @xmath2 .",
    "so far we have only reported results using the oxdna average - base parameterization , in which the strength of base pairing and stacking interactions are independent of base identity .",
    "as the free - energy cost of disrupting a duplex to form a kink is sequence - dependent , it is important to consider how sequence might perturb the general trends we have elaborated thus far .",
    "we therefore studied a variety of sequences used in the v&h @xcite experiments including six at @xmath63 using the parameterization of oxdna that includes sequence - dependent thermodynamics ( ) .",
    "as duplex kinking for oxdna typically involves the breaking of base pairs , we observe that this kinking preferentially occurs at a  t base pairs .",
    "base pairs that are weaker than average introduce preferred locations for kinking ; thus , when duplex kinking is relevant , @xmath42 is expected to be larger for the sequence - dependent than for the average - base parameterization .",
    "this is indeed the case for @xmath64 .",
    "the sequence - induced variation for the v&h @xmath64 sequences is a factor of @xmath65 ( gc - content ) .",
    "this compares to a factor of @xmath66 between the extrema in gc - content , poly(at ) and poly(gc ) .    that we find sequence heterogeneity generally makes duplex kinking easier is consistent with our explicit investigation of the free energy of duplex kinking in the accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "our results imply that the crossover to cyclized configurations with duplex kinking occurs at slightly longer @xmath4 when sequence - dependence is included than for the average - base parameterization",

    "@xmath69 reflects the free - energy cost of bending to form the first base pair in a cyclization system , whereas @xmath70 reflects the entropic cost of bringing two monomers together within the simulation volume .",
    "the dimerization simulations are for a cubic simulation box of dimension , corresponding to a duplex concentration of @xmath71 .",
    "note that for clarity , we have depicted @xmath72 and @xmath73 as the free energy difference between the fully base - paired closed state @xmath74 and the transition state @xmath75 ; however , in practice , frayed states @xmath76 $ ] do contribute to the closed state . while the distinction does not significantly impact our results ( @xmath77 )",

    ", width=321 ]    as well as equilibrium constants , free - energy profiles as a function of the number of bases pairs were computed for each system we considered , as these can give more insight into the pathway for association .",
    "example profiles for cyclization and dimerization at @xmath78 are illustrated in .",
    "one interesting feature of the profiles is that the free - energy gain from hybridizing the complementary sticky ends once an initial base pair has formed is less for cyclization than for dimerization : @xmath79 .",
    "physically , this indicates that substantial additional bending stress develops as subsequent base pairs form for the cyclization system , reducing the free - energy gain upon zippering of the sticky ends relative to dimerization .",
    "for example , the @xmath80 configuration in ( c ) is clearly less bent than the @xmath81 configuration in ( b ) ( supplementary ) .",
    "the activation energies derivable from these profiles will be particularly useful in the next section when we consider the dynamic @xmath0-factor .      as noted in the introduction",
    ", the results of ligase experiments performed in the low ligase concentration limit should , in principle , be comparable to equilibrium @xmath0-factors ( although there are subtleties related to the ensemble of states actually detected by the ligation enzymes ) .",
    "indeed , for long dna molecules ( @xmath4 much longer than the persistence length ) and low ligase concentrations , there has been consistent agreement between experiment and the wlc model @xcite . however , cloutier & widom ( c&w ) @xcite reported results for @xmath4 shorter than the persistence length ( @xmath82 ) , showing an apparent deviation from wlc behaviour , with @xmath20 ( ) enhanced over the sy wlc prediction @xmath25 @xcite by a factor of @xmath83 .",

    "are in good agreement with the sy wlc expression , albeit with somewhat different materials parameters ( torsional stiffness , persistence length and pitch length ) than for oxdna , owing in part to different buffer conditions ( supplementary , ( a ) ) .",

    "however , as noted earlier , this is only a fair comparison if @xmath86 , which , as @xmath8 is expected to be length independent , also implies that @xmath6 should be independent of @xmath4 .",
    "however , since both v&h @xcite and more recent fret measurements @xcite suggest that @xmath6 increases with @xmath4 , this condition is not met .",
    "although we do not directly simulate the dynamics of cyclization , we can estimate the relative rates of processes using free - energy profiles such as those in and unimolecular rate theory for activated processes @xcite . in agreement with experimental investigations ,",
    "previous work on oxdna has shown that duplex formation has an effective `` transition state '' involving a very small number of base pairs @xcite .",
    "we therefore make the assumption that uncyclization and undimerization rates are given by : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a constant for dna melting , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are defined in .",
    "the physical content of this assumption is that an increased favourability of base - pair formation is manifested in slower unbinding rates .",
    "this is important because bending stress in cyclized systems reduces @xmath72 ( )",
    ". the rate constants will be equal ( @xmath86 ) in the very long length limit ( @xmath4 much longer than the persistence length ) .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath72 are plotted as a function of @xmath4 in .",
    "in particular there is a general decrease in @xmath72 at shorter lengths , suggesting @xmath6 increases with shorter @xmath4 , in agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "additionally , any torsional stress in the cyclized state is relieved as base pairs are disrupted , leading to the oscillations in @xmath72 at long lengths , with the minima occurring at the more torsionally stressed off - register lengths .     * ( b ) * uncyclization @xmath72 ( ) and undimerization ( , average highlighted with dashed line ) , all computed using the oxdna average - base parameterization . , width=321 ]    to compare with v&h s results for @xmath24 , we note that @xmath89    therefore , using , our approximation for @xmath90 is @xmath91 at each @xmath4 .",
    "we are now in a position to estimate @xmath90 from oxdna s equilibrium constants and activation free - energy barriers .",
    "we expect @xmath14 and @xmath73 to be length - independent as the excluded volume of the duplex far from the complementary single - stranded sticky ends is likely to have little effect on the dimerization process .",
    "indeed , this appears to be the case to within less than in @xmath92 ( ( b ) , supplementary ) .",
    "our resulting @xmath90 values are plotted in , where they are compared to our @xmath42 values , and v&h s @xmath24 .",
    "we observe that oxdna s @xmath90 values lie substantially above @xmath42 , except in the limit of long @xmath4 for on - register lengths .",
    "only if all the stress - induced destabilization of the fully cyclized state is exhibited in the forward rate would @xmath93 .",
    "although the activation free - energy for cyclization increases as @xmath4 decreases ( ( a ) ) , the full bending and twisting stress present in the cyclized state is not yet present in the transition state where the two complementary sticky ends have formed their first base pair , e.g.  ( c ) , and so @xmath94 . instead , stress which is not present in the transition state leads to a decrease in the free - energy barrier for uncyclization ( ( b ) ) and accelerates uncyclization relative to undimerization",
    "alternatively , one can consider that the stress in the cyclized state subjects the duplex formed between the sticky ends to a shear force @xcite which is well known to lead to a more rapid rupture of a duplex @xcite .",
    "the observed behaviour is similar to that seen by v&h ; indeed , @xmath90 and @xmath24 agree remarkably well in the range @xmath95 , with reasonable agreement extending to @xmath96 .",
    "our results suggest that variation of uncyclization rates with @xmath4 may be an important contribution to apparent non - wlc behaviour in @xmath24 .    to begin to understand the difference between v&h s dynamic @xmath0-factor and @xmath25 a number of authors have tried to account for the role of the single - stranded tails in cyclization by incorporating a `` capture radius '' into the wlc @xmath0-factor calculation , as an approximation for how close the duplex ends must be in order for the sticky ends to hybridize @xcite .",
    "indeed , this approach leads to a significantly enhanced @xmath0-factor when a value that is taken to be roughly appropriate for the 10-base sticky ends of the v&h experiment , namely , is used @xcite .    assuming this approach is an attempt to capture the weaker constraints at the transition state , and hence to estimate the activation free - energy barrier relevant to @xmath97 ( note @xmath97 and @xmath16 are often not clearly differentiated in discussions of v&h s results )",
    ", we can use our oxdna results to test the reasonableness of this approximation by measuring the separation of the duplex ends in the transition state ensemble . at long lengths",
    "our measured capture radius is approximately constant with a value just under , but increases at shorter lengths because some of the stress at the transition state is partitioned into stretching the single - stranded tails , reaching a maximum of about at about @xmath98 ( supplementary ) .",
    "thus , although the value used previously @xcite is not unreasonable , unsurprisingly this approach does not capture the full complexity of the transition state to cyclization , and nor does it account for the strain present in the sticky ends for them to achieve contact .",
    "therefore , although explaining a dynamic @xmath0-factor in terms of a capture radius is physically well - motivated , it does not provide a full understanding .",
    "moreover , as its value is not tightly constrained , and certain contributions to stability are neglected , it is difficult to judge whether wlc behaviour is violated or not by comparing a calculated @xmath0-factor curve to an experimental @xmath97 .",
    "we note that @xmath90 , in contrast to @xmath42 , varies comparatively smoothly with @xmath4 , with only a weak periodicity on the length scale of the pitch length .",
    "the shallow maxima at larger lengths occur at @xmath99 , because the two sticky ends are then on the same side of a torsionally unstressed duplex .",
    "consistent with this smooth variation , @xmath100 also varies relatively smoothly with @xmath4 .",
    "the strong periodicity in @xmath42 comes from the free - energy gain when zippering up the complementary sticky ends ( @xmath101 ) , which is greater when @xmath4 is an integer multiple of the pitch length , allowing the formation of a relatively relaxed coaxially stacked circle . v&h",
    "suggest that their @xmath24 data at @xmath102 displays a strong oscillation with a period of about one pitch length ( ) . in agreement with vologodskii _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite we find no physical mechanism for such a strong oscillation and would suggest that the experimental evidence for this oscillation is not compelling .",
    "at the shortest lengths investigated , @xmath24 still lies above @xmath90 .",
    "some of this difference might be due to our use of the oxdna average - base parameterization .",
    "sequence does play a role in dna flexibility , as noted in the accompanying paper @xcite , but the impact of sequence variation is non - trivial .",
    "in particular , because kinks tend to localize to at base pairs , kinking in the duplex is easier for a sequence with gc - content than reported for our average - base parametrization .    using the oxdna parameterization with sequence - dependent thermodynamics we found @xmath97 to increase compared to the values for the average - base parameterization .",
    "consistent with our results for @xmath42 , we find a sequence - induced variation in @xmath90 of a factor of @xmath65 for the six v&h @xmath64 sequences ( gc - content ) @xcite compared to a factor of @xmath66 between the extrema in gc - content , poly(at ) and poly(gc ) .",
    "this compares to a factor of @xmath103 for experimental looping rates , a discrepancy which may be explained by v&h s use of poly(a ) tracts , a sequence - motif well - known to introduce intrinsic curvature in duplex dna @xcite .",
    "as oxdna s sequence - dependent parameterization is based on the nearest - neighbour thermodynamics of santalucia _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite , alternative structural motifs such as poly(a ) tracts are outside the scope of the model .",
    "oxdna also does not reproduce sequence - dependent structural ( e.g.  the difference in size between purine and pyrimidine ) or mechanical ( e.g.  flexibility ) properties .",
    "the origin of the remaining discrepancy between @xmath24 and @xmath90 at the shortest @xmath4 is not yet clear , but may indicate enhanced flexibility for v&h versus oxdna due to wlc ( lower persistence length ) or non - wlc behaviour ( kinking within the duplex at slightly longer @xmath4 ) .",
    "the oxdna persistence length of is within the range of experimental observations at , but smaller values at are not implausible @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that oxdna slightly underestimates the prevalence of kinking within duplex regions @xcite ; an onset of kinking at slightly lower stress ( longer @xmath4 ) would make cyclization at shorter lengths more favourable .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the presence of fluorophores may cause perturbations in the v&h experiments .",
    "v&h do report @xmath13 for some systems ; oxdna results are in good agreement for those lengths ( supplementary ) .",
    "cyclization is a system dependent manifestation of the general thermodynamics of strong dna bending , elaborated in the accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "the remarkable range of behaviour in cyclized systems is explicable by the interplay between three specific deformation modes of stressed duplexes : continuous bending , kinking and fraying .",
    "oxdna reveals that each of these modes is present at a characteristic length - scale with respect to cyclization : continuous bending at long lengths ( @xmath45 ) , duplex kinking at intermediate lengths ( @xmath46 ) and fraying at short lengths ( @xmath104 ) . in addition , as @xmath4 is shortened , there is an increase in kinking at the two nicks that remain after the hybridization of the sticky ends . at longer lengths , kinking at a nick",
    "is only observed for `` off - register '' molecules that can not form torsionally relaxed coaxially stacked circles .",
    "the ability of said nicks to relax bending , as well as torsional stress , means that they become increasingly prevalent for shorter @xmath4 . at the shortest lengths , kinking at both nicks",
    "is dominant .",
    "we use oxdna to probe the reported observation of non - wlc behaviour in fret - based cyclization experiments @xcite . in agreement with experiment",
    ", we observe that for shorter values of @xmath4 , the apparent @xmath0-factor lies substantially above the predictions of the shimada & yamakawa ( sy ) @xcite wlc model .",
    "we also observe that the periodic oscillations predicted by the sy model are suppressed .",
    "this behaviour arises from two conceptually distinct phenomena .",
    "firstly , highly stressed cyclized systems can adopt configurations that relax stress more effectively than through continuous bending , thereby reducing the overall free - energy cost of cyclization relative to a direct estimate based on a simple wlc - based model . at various values of @xmath4",
    ", oxdna identifies kinking at nicks , kinking within the duplex region and fraying of base pairs as key relaxation modes .",
    "secondly , oxdna suggests that not all of the reduction in @xmath13 relative to @xmath14 is due to stress manifest in the cyclization rate ; uncyclization rates are also substantially increased relative to undimerization rates .",
    "the result is that dynamic @xmath0-factors based on the ratio of cyclization and dimerization rates lie even further above the sy prediction than their equilibrium @xmath0-factor counterpart .    of the above effects , only kinking within the duplex can reasonably be described as truly non - wlc behaviour .",
    "wlc and related statistical models do not predict absolute rates directly .",
    "kinking at nicks and fraying can only occur when the dna backbone is discontinuous , and any resultant effects are unrelated to whether wlc models accurately describes the body of the dna duplex . in oxdna",
    "( with the average - base parameterization ) , kinking in the duplex only has a substantial effect for @xmath105 .",
    "note , if sequence dependence is taken into account , then kinking may occur for slightly longer lengths .",
    "our results suggest that much of the apparent `` extreme bendability '' reported by vafabakhsh and ha @xcite can be attributed to factors that are not strictly speaking evidence of non - wlc behaviour",
    ". we can not account for deviations at their very shortest lengths ( @xmath106 ) . in oxdna , kinking within the duplex region is present , but not completely dominant .",
    "it is possible that oxdna slightly overestimates the difficulty of kinking within a duplex ",
    "if this is the case , the data for the very smallest values of @xmath4 studied by v&h may be indicative of duplex flexibility over and above that predicted by the wlc , although we note that to give a substantial effect on @xmath16 , kinking must not only be present , but must dominate the ensemble .",
    "kinking dominating the ensemble at @xmath107 is inconsistent with oxdna predictions , and available experimental evidence for a `` molecular vice '' @xcite and dna minicircles @xcite .",
    "various authors have incorporated a `` capture radius '' into the wlc @xmath0-factor calculation to capture phenomenologically some of the effects listed above @xcite .",
    "indeed , this approach leads to an enhanced @xmath0-factor , but the choice of capture radius is somewhat arbitrary and imprecise , making it difficult to assess whether non - wlc behaviour is present . nonetheless , we find that the capture radius that has been used in the interpretation of v&h s experiments is not unreasonable .",
    "oxdna is only a model , and good correspondence with experimental results should not be over - interpreted .",
    "nonetheless , the relaxation mechanisms identified are clearly physically plausible . for example , enhanced uncyclization rates have previously been noted in the literature @xcite ( and also for transcription - factor mediated looping @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that much of the apparent discrepancy between the data of v&h and the predictions of wlc - based models are due to effects that are not true violations of the wlc model of duplex dna flexibility .",
    "our study also helps to reconcile the results of v&h with previous ligase - based assays which saw no evidence of enhanced flexibility at @xmath108 @xcite , and previous studies of minicircles which detected no evidence of duplex disruption at these length scales @xcite .    to explore whether the shortest lengths studied by v&h do show evidence of kinking and enhanced flexibility , we would propose experiments of shorter sequences and systematic collection of both dynamic and equilibrium data .",
    "the latter is extremely important ; statistical wlc models make equilibrium predictions , and so the breakdown of a wlc description can only be confirmed with equilibrium data .",
    "indeed , elucidating the subtleties of dynamic and quasi - dynamic ( c&w ) @xmath0-factors is one of the key issues addressed in this work .",

    "<S> dna cyclization is a powerful technique to gain insight into the nature of dna bending . </S>",
    "<S> the worm - like chain model provides a good description of small to moderate bending fluctuations , but some experiments on strongly - bent shorter molecules suggest enhanced flexibility over and above that expected from the worm - like chain . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use a coarse - grained model of dna to investigate the thermodynamics of dna cyclization for molecules with less than 210 base pairs . </S>",
    "<S> as the molecules get shorter we find increasing deviations between our computed equilibrium @xmath0-factor and the worm - like chain predictions of shimada and yamakawa . </S>",
    "<S> these deviations are due to sharp kinking , first at nicks , and only subsequently in the body of the duplex . at the shortest lengths , substantial fraying at the ends of duplex domains </S>",
    "<S> is the dominant method of relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate the dynamic @xmath0-factor measured in recent fret experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dynamic @xmath0-factor is systematically larger than its equilibrium counterpart , with the deviation larger for shorter molecules , because not all the stress present in the fully cyclized state is present in the transition state . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are important for the interpretation of recent experiments , as only kinking within the body of the duplex is genuinely indicative of non - worm - like chain behaviour . </S>"
