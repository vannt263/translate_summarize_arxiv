    "the number of edge - on disk galaxies with a boxy or peanut - shaped ( b / ps ) bulge is known to be significant . in fact , the fraction of these objects has continuously increased as sample selection , data , and classification criteria improved ( see * ? ? ?",

    "recently , @xcite classified @xmath11 edge - on disk galaxies and found @xmath3 of b / ps bulges , with a fraction higher than @xmath12 for all morphological types from s0 to sd .",
    "this was the first study to report such a large incidence of b / ps bulges in very late type systems , but it is also the largest and most homogeneous .",
    "b / ps bulges are therefore common , but they are only seen in highly inclined systems ( @xmath13 ; e.g.  @xcite ) , indicating that their shape is mainly related to the vertical distribution of light .",
    "several scenarios have been suggested to explain the structure and formation of b / ps bulges .",
    "they can be divided into two main categories : axisymmetric accretion and non - axisymmetric bar buckling models . @xcite and @xcite ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) showed that it is possible to form axisymmetric cylindrically rotating b / ps bulges from the accretion of one or ( more likely ) many satellite galaxies onto a larger galaxy host . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", however , the particular alignment required puts too many constraints on the orbits , angular momenta , and relative masses of the galaxies , and this process appears unlikely in view of the high incidence of b / ps bulges .",
    "moreover , satellite galaxies are not preferentially observed around galaxies with a b / ps bulge @xcite .",
    "using n - body simulations , @xcite first suggested that b / ps bulges could be due to the thickening of bars in the disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "they showed that soon after a bar develops through the usual bar instability , it buckles , thickens , and settles with a larger velocity dispersion and thickness .",
    "when highly inclined , the bar then appears peanut - shaped when seen side - on ( i.e.  perpendicular to the bar ) , boxy - shaped when seen at intermediate angles , and almost round when seen end - on ( i.e.  parallel to the bar ) .",
    "it is also largely cylindrically rotating .",
    "@xcite s ( @xcite ) results were later confirmed and improved upon by many studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and they are now universally accepted .",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) orbital structure of these bars has just been investigated in a series of papers ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) , allowing a more detailed comparison of models with high spatial resolution images .",
    "there are several observational studies supporting the connection between b / ps bulges and bars .",
    "most important for this work , @xcite suggested that bars could be detected in edge - on galaxies from their ( projected ) kinematic signature . in their pioneering study of two spirals with a peanut - shaped bulge ( and ) ,",
    "@xcite found a characteristic `` figure - of - eight '' bar signature in their position - velocity diagrams ( pvds ; the projected density of material as a function of line - of - sight velocity and projected position ) .",
    "although the interpretation of this signature was ultimately flawed , hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite confirmed its relationship to bars and showed how it can be used to identify and characterize edge - on bars from gas kinematics . in a study of emission - line spectra for @xmath14 edge - on spirals with various types of bulges ,",
    "@xcite later confirmed the link between b / ps bulges and bars . @xcite",
    "( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) also presented ionized - gas pvds for @xmath15 edge - on galaxies , @xmath16 with a b / ps bulge and @xmath2 with other types of bulges ( mostly spheroidal ) . using @xcite s ( @xcite ) diagnostics , they found bar signatures in @xmath17 of @xmath16 galaxies with a b / ps bulge ( @xmath18 ) and in none of the galaxies with a more spheroidal bulge .    in spite of the aforementioned studies ,",
    "our knowledge of the stellar kinematics of b / ps bulges and their hosts remains limited .",
    "this probably arises because the gas is a more practical tracer of the barred potential , being both easier to observe and reacting more strongly than the stars to asymmetries ( shocks ) .",
    "studying the stars directly is nevertheless essential as b / ps bulges are stellar structures and , when comparing to n - body simulations , stellar kinematics largely bypasses issues such as the selection of an optimal gaseous tracer ( h@xmath19 , co , , etc ) , star formation , and ( for gas - poor objects ) the response of the orbital structure to a massive gas disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "existing stellar kinematic studies of b / ps bulges are limited to a few objects and have largely focused on the issue of cylindrical rotation , using slits offset from the major - axis or perpendicular to it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as noted above , however , this is consistent with both axisymmetric and barred configurations , and so does not discriminate between the two dominant formation scenarios .",
    "we advocate here instead the new kinematic bar diagnostics of @xcite , which directly probe the shape of the potential ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the importance of b / ps bulges goes beyond their sheer number and interesting morphology , as they may hold vital clues for our understanding of bulge formation .",
    "there is growing evidence against significant merger growth in many bulges ( e.g.@xcite ) and a corresponding emphasis on secular evolution processes , largely bar - driven ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most theoretical models involve the growth of a central mass through bar inflow and/or possibly recurring bar destruction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the efficiency of bar dissolution mechanisms remains uncertain ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , because of their probable relationship to bars , b / ps bulges are likely to play a central role in those scenarios , and a proper understanding of their structure and dynamics is essential to constrain them .",
    "our primary goal in this work is thus to study the stellar kinematics of a statistically significant number of galaxies with a b / ps bulge , simultaneously and independently verifying their relationship to bars and probing for embedded structures .",
    "we study @xcite s ( @xcite ) sample of @xmath15 edge - on spirals , @xmath16 with a b / ps bulge and @xmath2 with other bulge types , as well as an additional @xmath20 b / ps bulges which showed little ( or confined ) emission and were only briefly discussed by the authors .",
    "the latter offer the best comparison with n - body models , being largely gas and dust free .",
    "in   [ sec : diagnostics ] , the stellar kinematic bar diagnostics of @xcite and @xcite are summarized . in   [ sec : obs ] , we describe the sample , observations , as well as the reduction and analysis of the data .",
    "the stellar kinematics of the @xmath0 galaxies is presented briefly in   [ sec : results ] , while ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] discusses in greater detail the structure and dynamics of b / ps bulges and how they fit into bar - driven secular evolution scenarios .",
    "we summarize our results and conclude briefly in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as b / ps bulges are only visible in ( quasi-)edge - on galaxies , a reliable morphological identification of bars is impossible . a plateau in the light distribution along the major - axis has often been argued to trace bars ( e.g.  @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) , but axisymmetric structures such as rings and lenses can also account for them .",
    "in fact , it is possible to construct axisymmetric b / ps bulges with simple two - integral distribution functions @xcite .",
    "we thus need bar identification methods for edge - on disks relying on kinematics , truly probing the shape of the galactic potential .    adopting a generic barred galaxy mass model , @xcite used periodic orbit families as building blocks to produce synthetic pvds of barred galaxies seen edge - on .",
    "they showed that because of the non - homogeneous distribution of orbits in a barred disk , characteristic gaps occur in the pvds between the signatures of the different orbit families .",
    "these can be used to kinematically identify an edge - on bar and constrain its viewing angle and mass distribution . unfortunately , those models are too primitive to be compared with either the observed gas or stellar kinematics",
    ". the gas does not follow periodic orbits , being affected primarily by shocks and dissipation .",
    "this led @xcite to develop more reliable gas kinematic diagnostics using the same mass model but full hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "these were successfully used by @xcite in their ionized - gas study .",
    "stars can also move on regular ( quasi - periodic ) , irregular , and chaotic orbits and must of course form a self - consistent system , effectively smearing out the signatures predicted by @xcite .",
    "more refined stellar kinematic models are thus needed .",
    "@xcite developed fully self - consistent stellar kinematic bar diagnostics for edge - on disks using high - quality n - body simulations similar to those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the simulations include a luminous disk and a live dark halo , but no initial bulge component . for various viewing angles , ( large ) inclinations , and bar strengths",
    ", @xcite extracted the stellar kinematics along a slit aligned with the photometric major - axis , contrasting the results with those of an axisymmetric disk . like most observers",
    ", they parametrized the kinematics with a gauss - hermite series ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using the same routine as used here ( although no deconvolution is required in the n - body case ; see   [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the characteristic bar signatures observed are numerous : i ) a major - axis light profile ( @xmath21 ) with a quasi - exponential central peak and a plateau at moderate radii ; ii ) a `` double - hump '' rotation curve , that is a mean velocity ( @xmath4 ) profile showing an initial rise followed by a plateau or slight decrease and a second rise to the flat part of the rotation curve ; iii ) a flat - top or weakly - peaked velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 ) profile with a secondary peak or plateau and , occasionally , a local central minimum ( strong bars only ) ; iv ) an @xmath6 profile _ correlated _ with @xmath4 over the projected bar length ; and v ) an @xmath7 profile with central and secondary minima . throughout this paper , @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent respectively the asymmetric ( skewness ) and symmetric ( kurtosis ) deviations of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) from a pure gaussian , while @xmath4 and @xmath5 have their usual meanings ( see   [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "those bar signatures are restricted to the projected bar length and are strongest when the bar is seen end - on , gradually weakening as the bar is viewed more side - on and they are stretched out ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , the plateaus in the light profile and the rotation curve , the peak in the dispersion , and the @xmath22 correlation are all stronger when the bar is seen end - on .",
    "this is particularly useful as it is opposite from the morphological bias , whereby the characteristic peanut shape is seen for side - on projections and indiscriminate round shapes are seen end - on .",
    "as expected , the strengths of all the bar signatures also correlate with the strength of the bar itself ( and the associated formation of an inner ring ) . furthermore , while one can probably build axisymmetric configurations giving rise to the @xmath21 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 signatures individually ( e.g.  double - disk structures ) , their radial extents are correlated @xcite and the behavior of @xmath6 appears characteristic of non - axisymmetric systems ( although it is not uniquely related to them ) .",
    "indeed , the losvds of ( inclined ) axisymmetric systems will generally have a steep prograde wing and a tail of lower velocity material , yielding an anti - correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "for decreasing surface brightness profiles , non - axisymmetric motions thus appear required for @xmath6 and @xmath4 to correlate .    in an ideal situation , one would like to use both morphological and kinematic information to study the intrinsic structure of a galaxy . in this paper , however , we will mainly rely on the aforementioned stellar kinematic diagnostics for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "our @xmath7 profiles generally have too low signal - to - noise ratios @xmath23 to be of much use , and we defer discussion of the light profiles to a forthcoming pair of papers where high quality @xmath24-band observations will be presented @xcite .",
    "we use the sample of @xcite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , consisting of @xmath0 edge - on spiral galaxies selected from the catalogs of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( @xcite ; disk galaxies with a b / ps bulge ) , and from that of @xcite ( @xcite ; galaxies with extreme axial ratios ) .",
    "all objects are visible from the south ( @xmath25 ) and have bulges larger than @xmath26 in diameter , to have enough spatial resolution to resolve the expected bar signatures with moderate seeing . in addition , for quick imaging with a small - field near - infrared ( nir ) camera , we required @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the diameter at the @xmath29  mag  arcsec@xmath30 isophotal level in @xmath31 ) .",
    "general properties of the sample galaxies are summarized in table  [ tab : prop ] .",
    "about three - quarters of the galaxies either have probable companions or are part of a group or cluster , including a few with alignments apparently suitable for accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , on the whole , the sample is not biased either against or for galaxies in a dense environment . of the @xmath0 galaxies ,",
    "@xmath1 were identified to have a b / ps bulge by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the other @xmath2 galaxies were also selected from those catalogs but show more varied morphologies , mostly spheroidal .",
    "those @xmath2 objects thus constitutes a `` control '' sample for comparison .",
    "as we have already mentioned , however , n - body simulations indicate that a ( thick ) bar seen end - on will appear round , so we can expect some of the control sample galaxies to be barred as well .",
    "indeed , in their study of the gas kinematics , @xcite found weak bar signatures in @xmath32 of the @xmath2 control galaxies ( and ) .",
    "since the sample has been put together from several catalogs , the classification of the bulges shapes is likely to be inhomogeneous .",
    "fortunately , however , the more recent and larger survey of @xcite includes all of our sample galaxies .",
    "although their classification is somewhat subjective , relying on visual inspection of contour plots from galaxy images ( like the other authors ) , @xcite did apply a consistent judgment to the entire sample so their classification should at least be homogeneous .",
    "we compare in table  [ tab : class ] the classification of @xcite with that adopted by @xcite from the catalogs of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . a few galaxies absent from the latter catalogs were also classified by @xcite themselves ( , , , and ) .",
    "the classifications are consistent for @xmath33 of the galaxies .",
    "three objects ( , , and ) are classified as boxy by @xcite but as ellipsoidal by @xcite , and one object the opposite ( ) .",
    "bar signatures were subsequently found by @xcite in both and .",
    "the uncertainties related to the morphological identification of bars in edge - on systems through the presence of a b / ps bulge underscore the necessity of kinematic studies .",
    "since all galaxies with extended ionized - gas emission were previously studied by @xcite , we will somewhat focus here on the @xmath20 objects with little ( or confined ) emission .",
    "those are all dust - free early - type spirals and should provide high quality stellar kinematics .",
    "the other galaxies are nevertheless important to confirm or infirm the kinematic bar detections of @xcite and to study the effects of gas .",
    "although the classification of the bulges shape is robust between the optical and nir ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nir images are essential to study their detailed structure because of significant extinction in most objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "clearly then , the observations from this paper should be reexamined in view of the @xmath24-band images to be presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "preliminary results have appeared in @xcite .",
    "sets of long - slit spectroscopic observations were obtained along the major - axis of each sample galaxy with the double beam spectrograph of the 2.3  m telescope at siding spring observatory , australia .",
    "the observations were carried out between 1995 december and 1997 may for @xmath34 nights in total .",
    "the red and blue arms of the spectrograph each cover about @xmath35    and were centered , respectively , on the h@xmath19 @xmath36 line and the mg  @xmath37 @xmath38 triplet for a redshift of @xmath39  km  s@xmath40 .",
    "total exposure times ranged from @xmath41 to @xmath42  s per object , split into @xmath43  s exposures .",
    "when no emission line was detected within @xmath44  s , the red arm of the spectrograph was recentered on the @xmath45 triplet . @xmath46",
    "site st - d06a thinned ccds were used for all observations .",
    "all galaxies were observed with a @xmath47 slit .",
    "when a strong dust lane was present , the slit was moved just above the major - axis .",
    "we note however that the objects were acquired by visually aligning the nucleus and major - axis on the slit using a slit - viewing video camera . as the system was rather insensitive , the positioning of the slit was not very accurate , especially for low surface brightness objects .",
    "ionized - gas kinematics extracted from the red arm have already been presented and discussed by @xcite for all objects with extended emission . here",
    "we will focus on the blue arm data , best suited to study the stellar kinematics using the absorption lines of the mg  @xmath37 triplet , h@xmath48 @xmath49 , and fe .",
    "the dispersion was @xmath50    pix@xmath40 , yielding a @xmath32-pixel spectral resolution of @xmath51  km  s@xmath40 ( @xmath52  km  s@xmath40 ; see below ) .",
    "the spatial sampling was @xmath53  pixel@xmath40 with typical seeings of @xmath54 .",
    "all data were reduced using standard procedures in iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) .",
    "the ( two - dimensional ) spectra were first bias - subtracted using virtual overscan regions and bias frames , dark - subtracted ( when necessary ) , and flat - fielded using flattened continuum lamp exposures .",
    "each spectrum was then wavelength - calibrated using bracketing arc lamp exposures and the spectra were simultaneously rebinned to a logarithmic wavelength ( linear velocity ) scale , corresponding to about @xmath55  km  s@xmath40  pixel@xmath40 over the observed wavelength range ( @xmath56   ) .",
    "the spectra were then corrected for vignetting along the slit using sky exposures .",
    "every exposure was corrected for earth s motion and relevant groups of exposures registered and combined .",
    "the resulting spectrum of each object was sky - subtracted using source - free regions along the slit and continuum normalized using a third - order spline with a small number of pieces .",
    "these two - dimensional spectra , from both galaxies and template stars , form the basis of the subsequent analysis aiming to extract the stellar kinematics .",
    "because only @xmath57 template stars were observed systematically over the entire observing program , we selected the fourier correlation quotient ( fcq ) algorithm of @xcite to derive the stellar kinematics of the galaxies .",
    "this method is based on the deconvolution of the peak of the template - galaxy correlation function with the peak of the template autocorrelation function and is relatively insensitive to template mismatch ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , being recovered non - parametrically , the losvds can be easily compared with those obtained from n - body simulations .",
    "we subsequently fitted the losvds with a gauss - hermite series @xcite , yielding the mean stellar velocity @xmath4 and the velocity dispersion @xmath5 , as well as the asymmetric ( @xmath6 ) and symmetric ( @xmath7 ) deviations from a pure gaussian .",
    "this is essential given the complex shapes expected from the profiles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we nevertheless fit @xmath4 and @xmath5 independently of @xmath6 and @xmath7 so that our results are directly comparable with single gaussian fits .",
    "we use the deconvolution and fitting algorithms as originally implemented in the xsauron software package ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting stellar kinematics for the @xmath0 sample galaxies are presented in figure  [ fig : kin_noem ] ( b / ps bulges with no or confined emission ) , figure  [ fig : kin_em ] ( b / ps bulges with extended emission ) , and figure  [ fig : kin_control ] ( control sample ; all with extended emission ) .",
    "the latter two figures can be directly compared to those in @xcite for the gas kinematics . from top to bottom , each panel shows an optical image of the galaxy ( with isophotal contours ) and registered @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 profiles along the major - axis .",
    "the spatial scale varies from galaxy to galaxy but the kinematic limits are the same .",
    "the data were folded under the assumption of bisymmetry and the errors reported are half the difference between the approaching and receding sides of each galaxy .",
    "when the datum from one side is missing or corrupted ( e.g.due to failure of the deconvolution algorithm or a foreground star ) , the datum is mirrored and denoted by a cross without an error bar . to ensure a homogeneous and minimal @xmath23 in the outer parts of the galaxies , the data were binned until @xmath58 per spatial and spectral element for @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath59 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , explaining the different bins for those quantities .",
    "the final @xmath23 is thus at least @xmath60 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath61 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we tested our results for various sources of errors and uncertainties : strong sky emission lines , template mismatch , erroneous continuum normalization , variable spectral focus , and strong galactic emission lines .    a number of night sky emission lines from natural ( e.g. , ) and",
    "man - made ( e.g.  , ) sources are present in the observed wavelength range ( see * ? ? ?",
    "all were successfully removed by our sky subtraction algorithm except for the strongest telluric emission line at @xmath62 , where the resulting artifacts are sufficient to affect our measurements , especially for faint galaxies .",
    "the spectra were thus truncated shortward of @xmath62 , shortening the spectra by about @xmath63   .",
    "this barely affects the quality of our measurements as there are no important galactic absorption lines longward of @xmath62 in our spectral range .    as gas kinematics was the primary goal of our observations , only two different types of stars",
    "were observed : k1  iii ( and ) and g5  iv ( ) . this seriously limits our ability to quantify the effects of template mismatch , but the stellar kinematics of all the objects was nevertheless derived using both types of star and the results compared . as expected , no qualitative or significant quantitative differences were found , except for @xmath7 which is known to be particularly sensitive to mismatch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our @xmath7 profiles are in any case noisy and will not be discussed in any depth .",
    "the results presented throughout this paper were thus derived using a k1  iii star only , and the effects of template mismatch will not be discussed further .",
    "we also tested for the effects of imperfect continuum normalization by comparing the stellar kinematics obtained from good and bad normalizations of both galaxies and template stars .",
    "we used a linear fit to the continuum for bad normalizations and a cubic spline of order @xmath64 for good normalizations ( @xmath65    per order ; our default value ) .",
    "we found that only a bad continuum normalization of the template stars affected our results .",
    "but since template star spectra have high @xmath23 and are few , obtaining a high quality continuum subtraction is both fast and easy .",
    "continuum normalization is therefore not an issue for our data .",
    "although the instrumental setup was the same for all observing runs , a number of parameters such as the spectral focus ( spectral resolution ) were set manually and could have changed slightly from run to run .",
    "we checked for any effect by comparing the kinematics of galaxies observed over more than one run , and by deriving the kinematics of a few objects using template stars observed over different runs .",
    "no significant differences were found . a more worrying issue concerns the spectral resolution near the ends of the slit , as it was not always possible to obtain a uniform spectral focus over the entire slit length . in certain runs , judging from arc lamp exposures , the spectral resolution degraded significantly and the spectral point - spread - function ( psf ) became non - gaussian at the slit ends .",
    "since template stars were only observed in the central parts of the slit , this could result in artificially high velocity dispersions and biased @xmath6 and @xmath7 measurements at large galactic radii . while we have no direct way of quantifying these effects ( except for characterizing the widening of the arc lines themselves in arc lamp exposures ) , only a few galaxies have stellar measurements extending over a substantial portion of the slit , with @xmath32 galaxies just reaching @xmath66 ( and ) .",
    "those do not show any peculiarities or systematic behavior at large radii , so we believe our measurements to be reliable over the radial range probed in all objects . in any case ,",
    "our analysis will focus on the central regions of the galaxies only ( within two bulge diameters ) , well within the properly focused region .",
    "lastly , we tested for possible effects due to the presence of galactic emission lines , which were not subtracted prior to deconvolution , and can not be masked when using fcq .",
    "the emission line of [ ] @xmath67 is detected in most objects and that of h@xmath48 ( superposed on the corresponding absorption line ) in about half , although both are rather weak in most cases .",
    "the [ ] @xmath68 doublet is not detected in any object , allowing us to compare the stellar kinematics obtained from a narrow range of wavelengths around the mg  @xmath37 triplet ( unaffected by emission lines ) to that derived from the entire spectra . using a short wavelength range",
    "is not advised with fcq but does not appear problematic here . using the same spatial bins ,",
    "no significant difference is found for the odd moments of the velocity profiles ( @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) , except for increased noise in the shorter spectra as expected ( and the failure of the algorithm for and , two of the three faintest galaxies ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sigma_test ] , the @xmath5 profiles derived from the shorter unaffected spectra are systematically higher for about one - third of the objects ( by typically @xmath69  km  s@xmath40 but up to @xmath70  km  s@xmath40 ) .",
    "this occurs over a limited radial range , typically encompassing the rapidly rising part of the rotation curve and never extending past the first velocity plateau ( see   [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "it could indicate that the kinematics of those objects is indeed affected by strong emission , since @xcite identified numerous bright , rapidly rotating ionized - gas disks ( nuclear spirals ) in those regions . however , there is no direct relationship between the strength of the central emission and the differences in velocity dispersions , suggesting a more complex explanation . as we will argue later",
    "( see   [ sec : evolution ] ) , it is likely that the ionized - gas disks are associated with star formation and a dynamically cold , young population of stars .",
    "these would have little effect on the mg  @xmath37 triplet but would strongly influence the h@xmath48 line , biasing any measurement including the latter to lower values ( as observed ) .",
    "this also suggests that a single late - type stellar template is not a sufficiently accurate representation of the effective stellar type of many sample galaxies over the entire radial range observed ( although it usually does a fine job in the outer parts ) . fortunately , however , the qualitative behavior of the profiles ( on which our analysis relies ) is not substantially affected .",
    "comparisons of our data with published stellar and gas kinematics are shown in figures  [ fig : comp_stellar ] and [ fig : comp_gas ] , respectively .",
    "we found only @xmath71 galaxies with published stellar @xmath4 and/or @xmath5 profiles ( whether in tabular or figure formats ) : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "@xmath72 galaxies have available ionized - gas rotation curves , all of them measured from h@xmath19 : @xcite , , , , , @xcite , , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite did not extract rotation curves from their data , relying instead on the entire pvd diagrams .",
    "although the identification of the approaching and receding sides in the literature is not always consistent with ours , we use matching sides here for comparison .    for the stellar kinematics ,",
    "our data generally have better spatial sampling and systematically extend to larger radii than published data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_stellar ] ) . and",
    "are best suited for comparison since they have recent measurements also derived with fcq @xcite .",
    "the agreement is excellent , except for at large radii where our @xmath5 measurements are systematically lower .",
    "however , we believe that this is due to @xcite s ( @xcite ) lower spectral resolution ( @xmath73  km  s@xmath40 rather than @xmath74  km  s@xmath40 here ) and we favor our results .",
    "the discrepancies in @xmath4 for at large radii are not serious since the galaxy is disturbed at large radii and our data are folded .",
    "@xcite s ( @xcite ) measurements of , obtained by cross - correlation @xcite , are also in good agreement , except for a few arcseconds at positive @xmath4 ( one - sided feature ) . in the central @xmath75 , @xmath5 is in agreement with the values derived from mg  @xmath37 only .",
    "@xcite s ( @xcite ) data for , , and only marginally agree with our , but they are of much lower quality , have much lower spectral resolution ( @xmath76  km  s@xmath40 ) , and were taken through a much wider slit .",
    "our data should thus be considered superior .",
    "the only true problem lies with , where our measurements strongly disagree with literature data , also derived with fcq but limited to the inner @xmath77 .",
    "we have no convincing explanation for the differences but offer a few hypotheses . very bad",

    "the structure and dynamics of ( thick ) bars may be strongly influenced by the presence of a gas disk , as has been advocated by @xcite .",
    "while they argued that the bar and buckling instabilities ( and thus the boxiness of the bulges ) are weakened by gas , which does not seem to be the case here ( there are plenty of gas - rich but strong b / ps bulges ) , it would be interesting to see if the kinematic bar signatures are strongly affected .",
    "lessening the discrepancy between simulations and observations for the later type galaxies is the fact that the kinematic bar signatures are modified for non edge - on systems , as the line - of - sight integration through the outer parts of the disk decreases ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for those cases ,",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath6 signatures become more extreme and the secondary @xmath5 peak increases , particularly for side - on bar orientations . as the gas - poor early - type galaxies of the sample are perfectly edge - on , while the gas - rich late - type galaxies are generally less inclined ( to avoid the dust lane ) , the latter are expected to have stronger signatures ( in a relative sense ) .",
    "there does not seem to be an obvious correlation between inclination and bar signature strength , but the effects of dust are hard to quantify and some of the strongest bar signatures are indeed seen in non edge - on systems .",
    "the effect is thus likely present , but it is unclear whether it can account for the very strong bar signatures observed in objects such as and",
    ".    the complexity of the kinematic profiles can also be artificially increased by the presence of dust along the line - of - sight .",
    "the kinematics of a few galaxies with perfectly edge - on and strong dust lanes is probably unreliable ( e.g.   and ) and other galaxies are likely to be affected to various degrees ( e.g.   and ) .",

    "@xmath24-band images will be especially useful to constrain the scales over which the kinematic bar signatures occur .",
    "currently , the extent of the features in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 can be compared among themselves , but they can only be roughly related to the relevant photometric scales of the bulge and disk .    to summarize , despite kinematic profiles in appearance more complex than those predicted by n - body simulations , our observations convincingly show that most galaxies with a b / ps bulge have a barred disk .",
    "this is because most galaxies possess the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and particularly the @xmath6 signatures expected from an edge - on bar (   [ sec : diagnostics ] and @xcite ) .",
    "this in turn strongly supports the suggestion that b / ps bulges are truly thick bars seen edge - on , although we have not probed the galaxies potential out of the disk plane .",
    "kinematics at large galactic heights is required for the latter , and we have acquired data for a few objects ( zamojski et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .    as noted in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , some off - plane kinematic observations of b / ps bulges do exist in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but those were mostly concerned with the presence of cylindrical rotation rather than the current bar signatures .",
    "cylindrical rotation is a generic prediction of ( thick ) bar models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is also consistent with axisymmetry @xcite .    interestingly , the galaxies in the control sample do not systematically show the behavior expected for a simple axisymmetric disk : i ) a smoothly rising rotation curve , ii ) a monotonically decreasing velocity dispersion profile , and iii ) an @xmath6 profile anti - correlated with @xmath4 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "some of those galaxies may well have substructures , but the problem most likely arises from the heterogeneous nature of the control sample .",
    "indeed , while there are a few catalogs of galaxies with a b / ps bulge ( see   [ sec : sample ] ) , there is no such thing for edge - on round bulges .",
    "the control sample was thus selected from the catalog of high axial ratio galaxies by @xcite and from galaxies apparently misclassified in b / ps bulge catalogs .",
    "this is less than satisfying , and and clearly represent transition objects ( weak b / ps bulges and thus probably weak bars ) .",
    "those @xmath32 objects have the `` boxiest '' bulges of the control sample and show characteristic kinematic bar signatures .",
    "@xcite already pointed out that they have weak bar signatures in their ionized - gas kinematics . to confirm that most non - b / ps bulges are also non - barred ( but not all , since some are expected to be if the bar is seen end - on ) , a study similar to ours but focusing instead on round bulges would be highly valuable .",
    "a larger and better defined control sample is thus essential to strengthen our results .      as mentioned above ,",
    "at least @xmath14 of the @xmath1 galaxies with a b / ps bulge ( @xmath9 ) show a decrease of @xmath5 in the very center . in a few galaxies ,",
    "this local minimum extends over several arcseconds and can reach @xmath94 of the observed peak ( e.g. , , and ) , although it is generally much smaller in both size and intensity ( e.g.   and ) .",
    "@xmath64 of those galaxies also show a characteristic double - hump velocity profile .",
    "the standard explanation for both features is the presence of a cold central stellar disk originating from gas inflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite noted the existence of central @xmath5 minima in purely dissipationless n - body simulations .",
    "@xcite later showed that they can arise naturally from the orbital structure of ( strongly ) barred disks ( depending on the axial ratio radial dependence of the @xmath95 orbits ) .",
    "we have so far argued for the latter possibility in this paper because of the @xmath22 correlation at moderate radii ( i.e.over the expected bar length ) , which is characteristic of triaxiality and bypasses the need for gas @xcite .    however , the observations do show a strong anti - correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath4 in the inner parts of most sample galaxies ( including all those with a central @xmath5 minimum and a reliable @xmath6 profile ; e.g.  , , and ) .",
    "this behavior is not observed in any of the n - body simulations of @xcite and suggests that not only are the inner parts of the galaxies cold ( i.e.  rapidly rotating ) , but also that they are very close to axisymmetric . in those objects , the region where @xmath6 and @xmath4 anti - correlate appears to have largely decoupled from the rest of the galaxy ( and the bar ) and circularized , forming a dense and ( quasi-)axisymmetric central stellar disk .",
    "this is supported by the sharp transition between the @xmath22 anti - correlation and correlation regions . furthermore , ( quasi-)axisymmetric central stellar disks naturally explain why prominent double - hump @xmath4 profiles and central @xmath5 minima are observed in peanut - shaped bulges as well as boxy - shaped ones , contrary to viewing angle expectations",
    ". once circularized , the kinematic signatures of the inner regions will be largely independent of viewing angle ( but not exactly , because of the line - of - sight integration through the main disk , which remains non - axisymmetric ) .    as expected , the extent of the central @xmath22 anti - correlation is roughly equal to that of the rapidly rising part of the rotation curve . if present , the extent of the central @xmath5 minimum is also equal or smaller ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schem_diagram ] ; , , and ) . of the @xmath57 galaxies in the control sample which show a central @xmath5 depression ,",
    "is probably affected by dust , but and appear as regular objects with large - scale axisymmetric disks ( and no @xmath22 correlation ) .    as our kinematic profiles are luminosity - weighted",
    ", the central disks could in principle be fairly bright but only marginally colder than their surroundings , or both much fainter and colder .",
    "the strong @xmath22 anti - correlation argues that they are much colder . in either case , the luminosity requirement is most easily fulfilled for our sample as the ( projected ) surface brightness of disks is maximized when viewed edge - on ( assuming the central disks to be coplanar with the large - scale galactic disks ) .",
    "a quantitative estimate of how luminous ( and massive ) these disks must be would nevertheless be useful , and the @xmath24-band images will help constrain this .",
    "while the conventional view is that both a classical bulge and a ( separate ) bar can usually be clearly identified photometrically in face - on barred systems ( at least in early - type ones ) , it is questionable whether those bulges are systematically hot .",
    "arguments that central disks can masquerade as bulges date back at least to @xcite , and @xcite reviewed much of the photometric and kinematic evidence available then . among others ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite more recently argued for the presence of significant central disks in bulges , using high - quality observations .",
    "in fact , much recent work shows that bulges are often not prominent and can have rather shallow light profiles , with sersic index @xmath96 ranging from roughly @xmath97 to @xmath98 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , as well as young stars and bar or spiral structures ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "see @xcite for similar arguments .",
    "those observations raise the interesting possibility that the decoupled central stellar disks identified in most of the sample galaxies are in fact the so - called bulges seen in face - on barred galaxies . while their scale seems rather small ( i.e.  typically equal to the width of the bar ) , they are ( quasi-)axisymmetric , have similar stellar kinematics , and also appear to have similar luminosity profiles . indeed",
    ", even simple optical light profiles derived by summing our data in wavelength ( not shown ) show that the central light peak is close to exponential and typically extends over the first velocity hump only ( approximately to the radius where the box / peanut shape is maximum , although this varies somewhat as a function of viewing angle ) .",
    "this again argues against merger - driven growth for those bulges and suggests that many classical bulges may well be concentrated disks ( i.e.  non - exponential disks ) , with a structure closer to truncated cylinders rather than spheroids ( see * ? ? ?",
    "axisymmetric `` bulges '' would then grow at the center of bars , rather than out of their destruction .",
    "the implications from the above is that the central peak in the light profile , normally associated with the bulge in face - on systems , is kinematically cold and contained _ within _ the vertically extended ( thick ) region of edge - on systems ( i.e.  the b / ps bulge ) , itself only a portion of the bar ( which extends to the turnover radius of the rotation curve ) .",
    "this clearly remains speculative without good quality photometry , but those issues will be explored further with the @xmath24-band observations presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar ideas are expressed by @xcite in the specific cases of and .      the n - body simulations discussed by @xcite ( @xcite ;",
    "but see also @xcite ) undergo substantial bar - driven evolution as the disk transfers angular momentum to the halo .",
    "the bar and its associated kinematic signatures grow in length and strength with time , but there is no evidence that the central parts circularize .",
    "it is thus doubtful whether purely stellar processes could give rise to the central @xmath22 anti - correlations and the ( quasi-)axisymmetric central stellar disks argued for above .",
    "on the other hand , our results fit nicely in a scenario where the identified central stellar disks form through bar - driven gas inflow . because of the torques and shocks they generate , bars are very efficient at driving gas toward their centers ( assuming there is a sufficient reservoir of material at large radii ; see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the gas tends to accumulate near the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr , if present ) , often vigorously forming stars and giving rise to a highly visible nuclear ring ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the conditions and behavior of the gas at and within the ilr are still under debate ( but see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) , but this is unimportant for our discussion as long as a sufficient mass is accumulated to circularize the potential .    once the potential is ( quasi-)axisymmetric , @xmath6 and @xmath4 will anti - correlate ( but the @xmath4 and @xmath5 signatures will persist ) .",
    "furthermore , any star formation in the gas disk will enhance the stellar kinematic features and keep the central stellar disk cold , negating the effects of possible heating mechanisms .",
    "this is likely as there is overwhelming evidence for star forming central gas disks ( nuclear spirals ) in most of the sample galaxies with extended emission @xcite .",
    "in fact , a visual inspection shows that the strength of these ionized - gas disks loosely correlates with the strength of the central @xmath22 anti - correlation . for the galaxies with no emission",
    ", we must assume either that the gas is not ionized or , more likely , that the reservoir of material has been exhausted and star formation in the central disks has ceased .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that no central @xmath5 minimum is seen in any of the gas - poor galaxies , suggesting that their central disks are kinematically hotter , and thus presumably older , than gas - rich systems ( has strong emission but it is confined to the inner few arcseconds )",
    ".    current or recent star formation in the central disks is further supported by our experimentations with emission line subtraction (   [ sec : quality ] ) . indeed , while the results for the two stellar templates ( k1  iii and g5",
    "iv ) are identical , this is not the case when using a single template and comparing the kinematics derived from the entire spectra ( including h@xmath48 ) or the mg  @xmath37 region only .",
    "then , the @xmath4 and @xmath6 profiles are essentially identical , but as shown by figure  [ fig : sigma_test ] the mg  @xmath37 dispersions are systematically higher for about one - third of the sample . as young stars contribute preferentially to h@xmath48 , the older stars appear kinematically hotter .",
    "the effect extends mainly over the rapidly rising part of the rotation curve ( or at most to the end of the first plateau ) , where the central @xmath5 minima and the @xmath22 anti - correlations are observed . as the first velocity hump",
    "is originally caused by the projection of the @xmath95 orbits ( perceived excess rotation ; see @xcite ) , this implies that the central disks are always contained within the width of the bar , exactly what is expected if they are fed from it ( shocks occur along the leading edges of the bar ; see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "our data thus seem perfectly consistent with a scenario where bars give rise to both the observed b / ps bulges ( through bar - buckling ) and decoupled , nearly axisymmetric central stellar disks ( through gas inflow and subsequent star formation ) . adding gas and star formation to the simulations of @xcite or a detailed comparison with similar existing models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would thus be extremely valuable . given that at least @xmath99 of bulges across all morphological types are b / ps @xcite , our results have important implications for our understanding of the structure and evolution of all bulges .",
    "bulges here appear to be made up mostly of disk material which has acquired a large vertical extent through vertical instabilities . together with the central disks , they are thus consistent with a formation dominated by bar - driven secular evolution processes rather than merging .",
    "we note however that while bar - driven secular evolution scenarios are often invoked to argue for a gradual drift of late - type bulges toward earlier types , this aspect of the scenarios is not effectively probed here .",
    "we have no way to tell whether the bars detected here will later on be destroyed by the sufficient accumulation of gas in their centers ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) , thus contributing to the growth of a more axisymmetric spheroidal bulge , or whether this process may have already occurred in some of the galaxies . the kinematics presented here , although limited to the equatorial plane , appears perfectly consistent with that expected from disk material only .",
    "we do not _ require _ the presence of an additional `` classical '' ( i.e.  both axisymmetric and hot ) bulge in addition to the ( thick ) bar detected . whether we can rule out the presence of a rounder and more pressure supported component with our observations is harder to answer , and it would presumably require detailed modeling of individual objects .",
    "such a component may be consistent with the velocity dispersion peaks observed in some objects ( particularly when using mg  @xmath37 only ) , but it tends to disagree with the flat @xmath5 profiles ( or local central @xmath5 minimum ) observed in others .",
    "@xmath24-band imaging and kinematics at large galactic heights are better suited to constrain the additional presence of a classical bulge and will be discussed elsewhere ( @xcite ; zamojski et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "we note however that @xcite argued for the presence of both a concentrated inner disk and a ( much ) smaller classical bulge in the two galaxies they studied ( and ) .",

    "they thus most likely harbor a bar seen end - on ( but see @xcite for ) . the third non - boxy galaxy ( ) shows neither kinematic nor photometric bar signatures .",
    "all the presumably barred galaxies also show an @xmath22 anti - correlation in the center , as observed here .",
    "@xcite s ( @xcite ) results are thus entirely consistent and supportive of ours . based on photometric evidence",
    ", he in fact suggested that bars could be at the origin of the @xmath6 slope reversals observed , but he lacked the diagnostics of @xcite to confirm it .",
    "@xmath57 of the above galaxies also show a central ionized - gas disk and @xmath57 a local minimum in the minor - axis @xmath5 profile , further supporting the presence of a thin , rapidly rotating stellar ( and sometimes gas ) disk at the center of the objects",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the ionized - gas kinematics shows the same kind of bar signatures predicted by @xcite and observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although we prefer to delay the discussion of photometric papers to @xcite , @xcite discuss the photometry of @xmath100 nearly edge - on s0s along with the stellar kinematics of @xmath14 .",
    "they derive the major - axis disk profile of each object by subtracting a pure ellipsoidal model constrained above the equatorial plane .",
    "they almost systematically identify an outer disk with an inner cut - off , but also a number of steep inner disks .",
    "although no explanation is offered for either structure , those results are expected in the context of bar - driven secular evolution scenarios .",
    "@xmath90 galaxies have a light profile plateau at intermediate radii , typical of a bar viewed edge - on .",
    "all the double - disks are observed in galaxies with such a plateau ( i.e.  a bar ) , as are all the rings identified .",
    "the latter also systematically occur at the end of the plateau and the turnover in the rotation curve , as expected for inner rings and bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among the @xmath64 objects with a light plateau and stellar kinematics ( , ,",
    ", , , , , and ) , @xmath2 have a double - hump velocity profile characteristic of bars ( all also have a double - disk structure ) and only @xmath32 do not ( none have a double - disk structure ) .",
    "given the poor spatial sampling of the data and the absence of error bars or seeing measurements , this is perfectly consistent with a one - to - one relationship between bars and light plateaus .",
    "therefore , while @xcite s ( @xcite ) inner disks can be assimilated with the central stellar disks argued for here ( i.e.  the central region where @xmath6 and @xmath4 anti - correlate ) , their arguments for truncated outer disks are questionable .",
    "as one moves from the outside in , we see no evidence of a disk truncation , but rather simply the beginning of the bar and an increase in the scaleheight of the disk ( the b / ps bulge and @xmath22 correlation region ; see @xcite ) .",
    "no separate ( classical ) bulge component is required either .",
    "@xcite recently obtained high spatial resolution stellar kinematics of @xmath92 intermediate - type barred spiral galaxies , each with a seyfert nucleus , secondary bar , and moderate inclination ( , , , and ) .",
    "all @xmath92 galaxies show a double - hump rotation curve and @xmath57 a central @xmath5 minimum .",
    "simple dynamical models require the presence of decoupled central ( and weakly non - axisymmetric ) stellar disks , presumably fueled by bar - driven gas inflow and star formation .",
    "this scenario is identical to the one proposed here .",
    "interestingly , the central disks required have similar masses and radii to the small ( classical ) spheroidal bulges assumed .",
    "it would also be interesting to know if the so - called `` double - wave '' rotation curves , reported by @xcite along the bar of many sb0s ( @xmath20 of the @xmath14 objects studied ) , could be related to the double - hump velocity profiles observed here ( or to the presence of decoupled centers ) .",
    "a generic interpretation is harder in this case as the orientation of each object differs ( orientation of the bar with respect to the line - of - nodes and inclination ) , but an explanation relying on the axial ratio variation of the @xmath95 orbits again appears likely ( comparing to the 2d model of @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison with current 3d n - body simulations would be straightforward .",
    "going beyond kinematics , stellar populations also offer an important tool to constrain galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "the absence of correlations between velocity dispersion and linestrength gradients ( at least in some bulge samples ; e.g.  @xcite ) argues against pure dissipational collapse @xcite and other arguments limit the influence of accretion and/or merging .",
    "unfortunately , detailed predictions for the stellar populations are still largely inexistent for bar - driven secular evolution scenarios .",
    "naively , one would expect bars to smooth out population gradients due to substantial radial ( and vertical ) motions , but any central star formation and subsequent stellar migration ( mixing ) will greatly complicate this picture and may actually enhance gradients in the center ( for early models , see @xcite ) .",
    "this seems to be borne out by observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for the gas ; @xcite for the stars ) , and ngc  4594 ( sombrero galaxy ; @xcite ) and ngc  7332 @xcite offer excellent examples where largely successful attempts have been made to interpret both the gaseous / stellar kinematics and the stellar populations coherently within a bar - driven secular evolution scenario .",
    "nevertheless , detailed chemo - dynamical models of barred galaxies taking into account all of the above effects are urgently needed .",
    "integral - field spectrographs with a large field - of - view and sufficient wavelength coverage offer the best potential to constrain the intermediate - scale structure of galaxies and ( in)validate formation scenarios . in this respect ,",
    "the sauron survey is particularly relevant , having mapped the ionized - gas distribution and kinematics , the stellar kinematics , and the linestrength indices ( age and metallicity ) of over @xmath101 ellipticals , lenticulars , and sa bulges to one effective radius ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 2d information confirms that a number of galaxies possess a structure similar to that argued for here , i.e.  a cold and thin central stellar disk ( first @xmath4 increment , central @xmath5 minimum , and @xmath22 anti - correlation ) embedded in a much larger and thicker triaxial component ( first @xmath4 plateau and @xmath22 correlation ) .",
    "central ionized - gas disks are also often cospatial with the central stellar disks",
    ". the best examples are ngc  4526 and ngc  3623 @xcite , but there are numerous others @xcite .",
    "the ( projected ) morphology of b / ps bulges departs strongly from that of classical , spheroidal bulges ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying an even more distorted 3d structure , but their high incidence ( @xmath102 of all bulges ; see @xcite ) makes them more than simple curiosities and a widespread mechanism must be able to account for their structure and dynamics . by studying the stellar kinematics of the @xmath0 edge - on spiral galaxies of @xcite , we have attempted here to discriminate between the two leading formations scenarios : accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bar - buckling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter is particularly attractive in view of currently popular secular evolution scenarios , which argue that bars may drive bulges along the hubble sequence ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ tab : class ] .",
    "@xmath103 of @xmath1 galaxies with a b / ps bulge show clear kinematic bar signatures ( @xmath104 ) , while only @xmath32 of the @xmath2 control sample galaxies do and are probably transition objects .",
    "we thus confirm the results of @xcite for galaxies with extended ionized - gas and , for the first time , extend those results to gas - poor b / ps bulges ( s0s ) .",
    "the kinematic evidence in favor of a close relationship between thickened bars and b / ps bulges is thus now overwhelming across all morphological types ( s0sbc ) , although we still have not probed the potentials out of the equatorial plane .",
    "zamojski et al .",
    "( 2004 , in preparation ) shall discuss the stellar kinematics of a few objects at large galactic heights .",
    "most objects show kinematic profiles in agreement with those predicted from n - body simulations of barred disks @xcite , including the expected relationship between bulge morphology and bar viewing angle .",
    "in particular , most galaxies with a b / ps bulge have i ) a double - hump rotation curve with a dip or plateau at moderate radii , ii ) a rather flat central velocity dispersion profile with a secondary peak or plateau and ( in about @xmath12 of cases ) a local central minimum , and iii ) an @xmath6 profile correlated with @xmath4 over the expected bar length , with up to three slope reversals . as expected if caused by a bar , the strengths and extents of those features",
    "are correlated .",
    "our @xmath7 profiles are generally too noisy to be of much use .",
    "a number of differences with the simulations also exist , most of which appear related to the past or current presence of gas .",
    "in particular , the kinematic profiles of most galaxies show an anti - correlation of @xmath4 and @xmath6 in the very center , over a region corresponding to the rapidly rising part of the rotation curve ( or at most the first plateau ) and encompassing the central light peak and central @xmath5 minimum ( if present ) . being cospatial with observed ionized - gas disks in gas - rich galaxies @xcite , this kinematic behavior is most likely due to cold quasi - axisymmetric central stellar disks , which we argue have decoupled due to bar - driven gas inflow , and may have been enhanced by subsequent star formation .",
    "b / ps bulges are thus entirely consistent with the predictions of most bar - driven secular evolution scenarios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereby bars can simultaneously account for the creation of a large vertically extended component out of disk material and for the accumulation of mass in their centers ( possibly associated with the so - called bulges of face - on systems ) , bypassing the need for merging or accretion of external material .",
    "lastly , we reiterate that @xmath6 is a very useful tracer of the structure and dynamics of galaxies .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , the correlation or anti - correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath4 appears to be a reliable diagnostics of the intrinsic shape , at least for highly inclined disks .",

    "<S> long - slit stellar kinematic observations were obtained along the major - axis of @xmath0 edge - on spiral galaxies , @xmath1 with a boxy or peanut - shaped ( b / ps ) bulge and @xmath2 with other bulge types for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> b / ps bulges are identified in at least @xmath3 of highly inclined systems and a growing body of theoretical and observational work suggests that they are the edge - on projection of thickened bars . </S>",
    "<S> profiles of the mean stellar velocity @xmath4 , the velocity dispersion @xmath5 , as well as the asymmetric ( @xmath6 ) and symmetric ( @xmath7 ) deviations from a pure gaussian are presented for all objects . comparing those profiles with stellar kinematic bar diagnostics developed from n - body simulations , we find bar signatures in @xmath1 of our sample galaxies ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies with a b / ps bulge typically show a double - hump rotation curve with an intermediate dip or plateau . </S>",
    "<S> they also frequently show a rather flat central velocity dispersion profile accompanied by a secondary peak or plateau , and numerous galaxies have a local central @xmath5 minimum ( @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 profiles display up to three slope reversals . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , @xmath6 is normally correlated with @xmath4 over the presumed bar length , contrary to expectations from axisymmetric disks . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristic bar signatures strengthen the case for a close relationship between b / ps bulges and bars and leave little room for other explanations of the bulges shape . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that @xmath6 is anti - correlated with @xmath4 in the very center of most galaxies ( @xmath10 ) , indicating that these objects additionally harbor cold and dense decoupled ( quasi-)axisymmetric central stellar disks , which may be related to the central light peaks . </S>",
    "<S> these central disks coincide with previously identified star - forming ionized - gas disks ( nuclear spirals ) in gas - rich systems , and we argue that they formed out of gas accumulated by the bar at its center through inflow . as suggested by n - body models , the asymmetry of the velocity profile ( @xmath6 ) appears to be a reliable tracer of asymmetries in disks , allowing us to discriminate between axisymmetric and barred disks seen in projection . </S>",
    "<S> b / ps bulges ( and thus a large fraction of all bulges ) appear to be made - up mostly of disk material which has acquired a large vertical extent through bar - driven vertical instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> their formation is thus probably dominated by secular evolution processes rather than merging . </S>"
