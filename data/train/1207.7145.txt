    "srruo@xmath0 is a metallic ferromagnet with t@xmath14 160 k and an experimentally observed moment of @xmath6 1.6 @xmath2 , whereas caruo@xmath0 is a nonmagnetic metal@xcite .",
    "pbruo@xmath0 seems to exhibit incipient magnetism , but whether this system is a metal or an insulator at low - t is still under debate@xcite .",
    "the crystal structure of baruo@xmath0 depends strongly on the temperature and pressure during synthesis@xcite whereas the other compounds are orthorhombic .",
    "depending on the amount of corner- and face - sharing ruo@xmath15 , the structures of baruo@xmath0   are categorized as the four- , six- , and ten - layered hexagonal phases ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively ) , in addition to the nine - layered rhombohedral phase ( @xmath19)@xcite . as discussed both theoretically and experimentally@xcite , the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 phases seem to be semi - metallic whereas the rest are nonmagnetic metals . early in 2008 , jin _",

    ", we will focus on the cubic phase , which shows ferromagnetic behavior with t@xmath14 60 k@xcite . on the basis of resistivity measurements , which show a sharp peak in the t - derivation of the resistivity at t@xmath21 , jin _",
    "et al . _ suggested simple metallic characteristics in the high - t region , but a fermi - liquid behavior in the low - t regime .",
    "the effective magnetic moment is 2.6 @xmath2 , close to the value for @xmath22 .",
    "however , the saturated moment of 0.8 @xmath2 is significantly less than the value corresponding to @xmath22 , implying atypical magnetic behaviors .",
    "moreover , when pressure is applied , @xmath23 decreases , reaching 50 k at @xmath24 gpa .",
    "the elastic properties and the pressure effects have been theoretically investigated to some extent@xcite , but no detailed studies of the magnetic and electric properties of this cubic phase have been reported yet .",
    "thus , we will address the magnetic properties of this system through first - principles calculations , including the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) , the lsda plus spin - orbit coupling ( lsda+soc ) , the fixed spin moment ( fsm ) , and a tight - binding wannier analysis .",
    "first , we optimized the lattice parameter @xmath4 in the cubic phase .",
    "lsda calculations lead to our optimized @xmath25 3.938  .",
    "this value is about 1.7% smaller than the experimentally - observed value at room temperature@xcite .",
    "we used the optimized lattice parameter in our calculations , since the total moment at the optimized @xmath4 is close to the experimental value , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "our calculations were carried out with the lsda and the lsda+soc implemented in the all - electron full - potential code wien2k@xcite .",
    "the basis size was determined by using r@xmath26k@xmath27 and augmented plane wave sphere radii of 2.5 for ba , 2.0 for ru , and 1.7 for o. the brillouin zone was sampled with a 14@xmath2814@xmath2814 @xmath29-mesh .",
    "for both the lsda+soc and the fsm calculations@xcite , a much denser @xmath29-mesh of 20@xmath2820@xmath2820 was used .",
    "the lattice parameter was relaxed until the forces were smaller than 2 mry / a.u .",
    "furthermore , the all - electron full - potential local - orbital code fplo was used for the tight - binding wannier function analysis@xcite .",
    "figure [ pmdos ] shows the overlapped total densities of states ( doss ) between the nonmagnetic @xmath19 and cubic phases in the range of 1 to 1 ev .",
    "the dos of the cubic phase is five times larger than that of the @xmath19 phase due to the sharp peaks at @xmath30 and 30 mev , suggesting strong magnetic instability .    using the lsda , we calculated the change in the total magnetic moment while varying @xmath4 from the experimental value to a value slightly smaller than the optimized one .",
    "as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fsm ] , the magnetic moment decreases linearly with a slope of @xmath31 4.3 @xmath2/ , indicating strong magnetovolume effects .",
    "this value is much larger than that of @xmath6 1 @xmath2/   in the invar systems @xmath32fe@xmath9 ( @xmath13=y , zr , hf , and lu)@xcite .    to clarify these behaviors ,",
    "fsm calculations were conducted .",
    "plots of energy versus total magnetic moment @xmath5 for varying values of @xmath4 are shown in fig .",
    "the difference in energy between the @xmath330 and the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground states decreases monotonically from @xmath6 32 mev at @xmath254.01    to 17 mev at 3.93  .",
    "the curves are fitted well by @xmath34 , with constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in the low-@xmath5 region . for the bare susceptibility @xmath37 ,",
    "the stoner - enhanced susceptibility is given by @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 is the single - spin dos at @xmath30 . in the low-@xmath5 region , @xmath40 .",

    "[ iv ] displays the obtained stoner parameters @xmath41 0.70(@xmath42 ) ev for each @xmath4 . as @xmath4 changes",
    ", the dos at @xmath30 fluctuates substantially owing to van hove singularities ( vhss ) near @xmath30 ( see below ) , as given in the middle panel of fig .",
    "@xmath43 decreases monotonically as @xmath4 decreases , which is consistent with the substantial magnetovolume effects , but for all the lattice parameters studied here , these values exceed the stoner instability criterion @xmath44 .    like the fsm results ,",
    "the lsda results indicate that the fm state is energetically favored over the nonmagnetic state by 16.4 mev for the optimized lattice parameter . for comparison , from a simple stoner instability , the energy gain of @xmath45/4 for @xmath41 0.7 ev is 175 mev , much larger than the calculated value .",
    "now , we will address the electronic structure of the fm states .",
    "figure [ fmdos ] shows the total and the atom - projected doss , which can be figured out well using the concept of ruo@xmath15 cluster orbitals@xcite .",
    "the ru @xmath46 states , hybridized with the o @xmath47 states , produce an antibonding manifold at 2 to 1 ev , a bonding manifold at 6 to 4 ev , and a nonbonding manifold at 4 to 2 ev , as can be seen in the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ fmdos ] .",
    "the bonding and the antibonding states of the ru @xmath48 and the o @xmath49 states lie in the regions of 8 to 6 ev and 0 to 6 ev , respectively .",
    "the exchange splitting of the @xmath46 manifold is about 0.5 ev . in the fm state , the total moment of 1.01 @xmath2",
    "is decomposed into 0.6 @xmath2 for ru and 0.28 @xmath2 for 3o .",
    "( the remnant is in the interstitial region . )",
    "the enlarged fm band structure in the lsda is given in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fmband ] . in this region ,",
    "the spin - up and -down structures are nearly identical , except for a difference in the on - site energy of roughly 0.5 ev due to exchange splitting . in the spin - up channel , in addition to a flat band at 0.2 ev along the @xmath50-@xmath51 line , which commonly appears in conventional perovskites , two saddle points , one each at the @xmath51 and the @xmath5 points , occur , resulting in vhss just below @xmath30 .",
    "these features may cause the unusual electrical properties observed experimentally@xcite .    the band structure of the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 clusters in the range of 8 ev to 2 ev was reproduced well using the tight - binding wannier function technique .",
    "we obtained two important parameters : @xmath52 hopping @xmath53 ev and direct oxygen - oxygen hopping @xmath54 ev . compared with the tight - binding parameters of the nonmagnetic caruo@xmath0 obtained by mazin and singh@xcite ,",
    "@xmath55 is about 10% smaller , but @xmath56 is about half as large .",
    "this is consistent with the 20% smaller bandwidth of the antibonding @xmath46 manifold in baruo@xmath0 , implying a stronger magnetic instability .",
    "soc affects the fermi surface ( fs ) topology in isovalent sr@xmath0ru@xmath9o@xmath11@xcite , though its effects are often negligible in @xmath57 systems .",
    "to consider the effects of soc , we conducted lsda+soc calculations .",
    "as shown in the upper inset of fig .",
    "[ fmdos ] , the changes in the dos are relatively small , leading to a tiny orbital moment of 0.013 @xmath2 on the ru ion .",
    "however , the mixing of states with other spin channel reduces the net moment by 10% , bringing it closer to the experimentally observed value of 0.8 @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the net moment is 0.91 @xmath2 , with local moments of 0.55 @xmath2 for ru and 0.26 @xmath2 for 3o .",
    "an additional remarkable feature is that vhss move toward @xmath30 in both spin channels . in the spin - up channel , the vhs at 0.1 ev splits into two peaks whereas two vhss merge and move to 0.1 ev in the spin down channel .",
    "these features reflect changes in the band structure at the @xmath51 and the @xmath5 points , as demonstrated in the enlarged band structure in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fmband ] .",
    "the strength of the soc is about 0.1 ev at these points near @xmath30 , but negligible elsewhere .",
    "the soc alters the fs topology at the @xmath51-points , in particular , in the intersecting pipe - like and cube - like fss ( not shown here ) , which are often observed in conventional perovskites@xcite .",
    "the open pipe - like surface becomes closed whereas the cube - like closed one becomes open .",
    "the fermi - liquid behavior experimentally observed in the low - t region may suggest the presence of correlation effects . considering that this material is a metallic @xmath57 system , the correlation effects should be weak . in our preliminary calculations using the lda+u method , applying @xmath58 to the ru ion shifts the @xmath48 manifold up and the @xmath46 manifold down , so only the intersecting pipe - like fs disappears . to evaluate the importance of the correlation effects , detailed experimental observations are necessary .    in summary , we investigated the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic cubic perovskite baruo@xmath0 , using various first principles calculations : fsm , lsda , lsda+soc , and the wannier function technique . in the nonmagnetic dos ,",
    "the cubic phase has a sharp peak pinning at @xmath30 , yielding @xmath59 , beyond the stoner instability . in the lsda calculations ,",
    "a few vhss appear near @xmath30 in both spin channels , resulting in a strong magnetovolume effect of @xmath31 4.3 @xmath2/ , significantly higher than that of the invar system @xmath32fe@xmath9 .",
    "the effects of the soc are substantial near @xmath30 around the @xmath51 and the @xmath5 points and affect the topology of some of fss , though the strength of the soc is negligible in most regions . at the optimized volume , the effects of the soc reduce the net moment by 10% from the lsda value , and it becomes very close to the experimentally - observed moment .",
    "our results show that the stoner instability produces ferromagnetism , and that the combined effects of the hybridization , the magnetovolume , and the soc determine the magnetic moment .",
    "furthermore , the unusually strong magnetovolume effects may imply atypical transport properties in this fm baruo@xmath0 , suggesting further questions for experimental research .",
