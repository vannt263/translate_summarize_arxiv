    "@xcite no structural phase transition has been reported in these compounds , and hence the spin and charge ordering phenomena in rnic@xmath0 compounds are thus native to the ncs crystal structure .",

    "we kept the values of cef parameters ( which were obtained from 25 and 100 k as mentioned above ) fixed for the analysis of 5 k data and varied molecular fields .",
    "first we varied only molecular field along @xmath37axis ( @xmath38 ) , while keeping zero - molecular fields along @xmath5 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath40axes ( @xmath41 ) .",

    "we have studied the magnetic properties of cenic@xmath0 using magnetic susceptibility , heat capacity , inelastic neutron scattering and @xmath1sr measurements . a magnetic transition around 20 k is observed with the emergence of oscillations in zero field @xmath1sr spectra .",
    "we fitted the temperature dependence of the internal magnetic fields to a model of a mean field magnet , which revealed 3d nature of magnetic interactions .",
    "ins measurements of polycrystalline cenic@xmath0 at low temperatures indicate two cef excitations at 8 and 30 mev . at 5 k",
    ", we observe an additional peak at 4.5 mev due to spin - wave excitations . above @xmath44 ,",
    "this peak is not present , but quasielastic scattering is observed .",
    "a linear fit to the temperature dependence of the quasielastic linewidth gives an estimate of @xmath45 = 11 k. from an analysis of ins and magnetic susceptibility data with a cef model , we propose a cef scheme for cenic@xmath0 .",
    "the cef scheme correctly predicts the direction of the ordered moment , but the observed magnetic moment at 2 k is 0.6876 @xmath7/ce which is higher compared to the moment as observed from neutron diffraction ( 0.25 @xmath7/ce ) .",
    "we believe that the observed reduced moment is due to presence of hybridization between the localized ce@xmath46 @xmath8-electrons and the conduction band .",
    "further the susceptibility analysis reveals the anisotropic molecular fields , stronger along the @xmath31-axis , which is also in agreement with the direction of moment along the @xmath31-axis .",
    "the spin wave measurements on cenic@xmath0 single crystal will help to shade more light on the anisotropic exchange interactions in cenic@xmath0 .",
    "we note furthermore that the estimated on - site kondo exchange ( 11 k ) is of the same order of magnitude as the magnetic phase transition temperatures , which classifies this compound as a magnetically ordered kondo lattice .",
    "the complexity of spin ordering in cenic@xmath0 is inferred as a consequence of admixing of crystal electric field energies together with kondo and rkky exchange , and we believe that our study and determination of cef parameters presented in this work establishes the essential ingredients with which to formulate an understanding of the ground state in cenic@xmath0 .",
