    "fission plays a decisive role in determining the stability of heavy nuclei , where the coulomb energy competes with the nuclear surface energy .",
    "typical examples are superheavy elements ( she ) .",
    "although the fission barrier disappears in she in the liquid drop model , the nuclear shell effect leads to a relatively high fission barrier and eventually stabilizes she .",
    "the experimental efforts have been continued in many facilities to synthesize she using heavy - ion fusion reactions @xcite .",
    "it has been well recognised that fission plays an important role also in the context of nuclear astrophysics@xcite , but systematic investigations on its role in r - process nucleosynthesis have started only in recent years @xcite .",
    "the r - process is one of the most promising candidates that synthesize the elements heavier than iron ( fe ) . in this model ,",
    "nuclei capture a number of neutrons via successive @xmath3 reactions in a highly neutron - rich environment _",
    "e.g. , _ neutron stars . as a consequence ,",
    "the r - process path passes through the neutron - rich side in nuclear chart which can not be reached experimentally at this moment .",
    "heavy neutron - rich nuclei produced by the r - process may decay by spontaneous fission , neutron - induced fission , or beta - delayed fission @xcite . the neutrino - induced fission might also play a role if the neutrino flux is significant @xcite . in order to construct a reliable r - process model with fission , it is urged to calculate systematically fission barriers of many neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "theoretically , fission barriers can be calculated using either the macroscopic - microscopic model @xcite or microscopic mean - field models @xcite . in the latter approach",
    ", one selects a few important degrees of freedom for fission , such as quadrupole or higher multipole moments , and draws a fission energy surface using the constrained hartree - fock method with the corresponding constraining operators .",
    "the total energy is minimized with respect to all the other degrees of freedom than those considered explicitly in the calculation . in this sense",
    ", the mean - field approach provides an adiabatic potential energy surface for the case where the selected degrees of freedom are much slower than the other degrees of freedom so that they adiabatically follow the motion of the former at every instant .",
    "usually , one takes a mass ( _ i.e. , _",
    "proton+neutron ) quadrupole moment as one of the most important degrees of freedom . this implicitly assumes either that the isoscalar motion is much slower than the isovector motion or that the isoscalar and isovector motions are decoupled . for fission of neutron - rich nuclei , however , it is not obvious whether this assumption is justified , and it may be more natural that the shape degrees of freedom for neutron and proton are treated separately .",
    "in fact , a two dimensional energy surface spanned by proton and neutron deformations has been drawn recently for light neutron - rich nuclei , such as @xmath4c and @xmath5o@xcite . the difference in neutron and proton deformation parameters along a fission path for actinide nuclei",
    "has also been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the sensitivity of fission barriers for neutron - rich nuclei to a choice of constraining operator in the isospin plane . to this end , we use the constrained skyrme - hartree - fock + bcs method , and consider the mass , proton , and neutron quadrupole moments as the constraining operators . the constrained hartree - fock method with the proton ( neutron ) constraint provides an adiabatic energy surface for the case where the proton ( neutron ) is much slower than neutron ( proton ) .    the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we use a schematic model and illustrate an example in which the constrained - hartree - fock method with the three different constraints give significantly different results from each other . in sec .",
    "iii , we briefly summarize the theoretical framework for constrained skyrme - hartree - fock method .",
    "iv presents the results for the fission barrier , single particle levels , and the proton and neutron deformations along the fission paths for uranium isotopes .",
    "we then summarize the paper in sec .",
    "in the constrained hartree - fock method with a constraining operator @xmath6 , one minimizes the expectation value of @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of the system . the lagrange multiplier @xmath9 is determined so that the expectation value of @xmath6 becomes a given value @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath6 can be any one - body operator , but usually the mass quadrupole operator , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the quadrupole operators for proton and neutron , respectively , is considered as one of the constraining operators @xmath6 when one studies fission barriers . the aim of this paper is to compare such fission barriers with those obtained by using @xmath14 or @xmath13 .",
    "we call the latter scheme `` proton ( or neutron ) constraint '' while the former `` total constraint '' .     shown by the dashed line .",

    "our calculations indicate that the proton and the neutron deformations differ from each other even for the nucleus on the @xmath53-stability line , @xmath1u , and the difference increases as the total deformation parameter becomes large .    in the study of fission barriers based on the mean - field approaches ,",
    "one usually uses mass multipole moments as constraining operators .",
    "our results suggest that this approach is justified even for neutron - rich nuclei , where one might expect that the proton or neutron constraint is better . of course",
    ", it is always desirable to treat proton and neutron separately for neutron - rich nuclei , and draw a two - dimensional fission energy surface .",
    "however , it is rather demanding to do so if one has to take into account explicitly many multipole moments , including simultaneously the quadrupole and octupole moments , or even higher multipole moments . even in that case",
    ", our study clearly indicates that one can reduce the number of degree of freedom by introducing the mass multipole moments , rather than treating proton and neutron separately .",
