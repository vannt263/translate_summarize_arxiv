    "recently a very large linear polarization ( lp ) , @xmath4 , in the prompt @xmath5-ray emission of grb 021206 was discovered ( coburn & boggs 2003 ) . the degree of lp was at the theoretical maximum of the synchrotron emission , which implies an uniform ordered magnetic field over the visible region ( but see also eichler & levinson 2003 for the scattering origin of lp ) . since the causally connected region is smaller than the visible one ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 ) , an ordered field could be advected from the central engine of the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) and even drive the grb explosion ( coburn & boggs 2003 ; lyutikov , pariev & blandford 2003 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "lp of @xmath6 ( typically a few @xmath7 ) has been detected in the grb afterglows ( covino et al .",
    "2003 and references there in ) , which is attributed to synchrotron emission behind a shock ( e.g. , m@xmath8sz@xmath9ros 2002 ) . in most popular models ( gruzinov 1999 ; ghisellini & lazzati 1999 ; sari 1999 ; rossi et al .",
    "2002 ) , the magnetic field is generated at the shock front and completely tangled ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "lp arises due to the geometric asymmetry provided by the afterglow jet observed off - axis if the magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the jet have different strengths .",
    "the @xmath5-ray lp mentioned above could be also explained in this model if the jet is very narrow ( waxman 2003 ; nakar , piran & waxman 2003 ; but see also granot 2003 ) .",
    "thus the present issue is _ whether an ordered magnetic field exists or not_. if an ordered field exists in afterglows , its fraction to a tangled field carries valuable information on the grb central engine . in this letter",
    "we show that observations of the circular polarization ( cp ) could be a useful probe of the ordered field .",
    "cp has been detected in agn jets ( wardle et al . 1998 ; homan & wardle 1999 ; bower et al .",
    "2002 ) and x - ray binaries ( fender , et al . 2000 , 2002 ) in recent years .",
    "theoretically , these observations are explained by a plasma effect in synchrotron sources .",
    "we apply this theory to the grbs for the first time .",
    "there are two main mechanisms to generate cp : intrinsic cp of synchrotron emission and faraday conversion ( fc ) in sources .",
    "fc is a plasma effect which converts lp into cp ( e.g. , jones & odell 1977a , b ) .",
    "these are treated all together by solving the transfer equation of polarized radiation in  [ sec : trans ] .",
    "then , we show that _ the tangled field can not generate cp _ in  [ sec : mag ] . next we estimate cp from grb afterglows in presence of an ordered field together with a tangled field in  [ sec : after ] .",
    "we find that , if the ordered field is comparable to or more than the tangled one , the degree of cp is about @xmath0 at radio frequencies and @xmath1 at optical for the forward shock , and it reaches @xmath2-@xmath0 at radio and @xmath3-@xmath1 at optical for the ( early ) reverse shock .",
    "the radio cp of the reverse shock remains to be @xmath10 even if the ordered field is weak ( @xmath0 of the tangled one ) .",
    "cp in reverse shock radio emission of grb 990123 has an upper limit of @xmath11 at the @xmath12 confidence level ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ; see also finkelstein , ipatov & gnedin 2002 ) .",
    "further observation of cp will be a diagnosis of the ordered field and bring clues to the nature of the grbs .",
    "we first consider the evolution of the stokes parameters , @xmath13 , ( in units of erg s@xmath14 @xmath15 sr@xmath14 hz@xmath14 ) in a homogeneous plasma with a weakly anisotropic dielectric tensor ( sazonov & tsytovich 1968 ; sazonov 1969a , b ; jones & odell 1977a ; melrose 1980 ) .",
    "it is described by the transfer equation of the polarized radiation , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the azimuthal projection angle of the magnetic field on the plane perpendicular to the line of sight ( see figure  [ fig : magdir ] ) , @xmath18 are the absorptivity , @xmath19 are the emissivity , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are rotativity and convertibility , respectively . these coefficients for a relativistic plasma with a power - law energy distribution have been derived by sazonov ( 1969a , b ) for a particular frequency region , @xmath22 .",
    "we have extended the frequency region to @xmath23 , and both cases are summarized in appendix [ sec : app ] . for the emissivity @xmath19 , we consider only the synchrotron emission .",
    "there are mainly two ways to generate the circularity @xmath24 from synchrotron sources .",
    "the first one is intrinsic emission due to the emissivity @xmath25 ( legg & westfold 1968 ) .",
    "the second is fc ( e.g. , jones & odell 1977a ) , which is the conversion of @xmath26 and @xmath27 into @xmath24 by means of @xmath28 in equation ( [ eq : trans ] ) . if the natural modes of a plasma are nearly circular , the lp vector of propagating radiation rotates since the left- and right - circular modes have different phase velocities due to birefringence .",
    "this effect is well known as faraday rotation ( fr ) ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "fc is a similar phenomenon caused by birefringence of a medium .",
    "if the natural modes are linearly or elliptically polarized , the difference in the phase velocities leads to the cyclic conversion between cp and lp .",
    "fc becomes effective around the self - absorption frequency since @xmath29 for @xmath30 from equations ( [ eq : coef2 ] ) and ( [ eq : coef3 ] ) .",
    "note that , if the magnetic field is uniform , the synchrotron emission does not generate @xmath27 in the coordinate system with @xmath31 .",
    "therefore fc does not occur without the rotation of @xmath26 into @xmath27 by @xmath32 .",
    "when we consider the tangled magnetic fields later , the coefficients in equation ( [ eq : trans ] ) are averaged with respect to the distribution of the magnetic field .",
    "this is justified when the typical scale over which the stokes parameters change is much larger than that of the field orientation and hence the correlations between the stokes parameters and the transfer coefficients tend to zero ( ruszkowski & begelman 2002 ) .",
    "since we know very little about the magnetic field configuration in the afterglows of the grb s , we here consider two components , i.e. , the ordered field and the axisymmetric tangled field . there is a preferred direction in which the fluid moves .",
    "therefore , the assumption of the axisymmetry of the tangled field is quite natural .",
    "the ordered field is expected in the patchy model ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 ) , or if the magnetic field advected from the central engine prevails or an ordered magnetic field exists in the medium into which the shock propagates ( granot & k@xmath33nigl 2003 ) . the tangled field could be produced by the weibel instability ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ) or the turbulence behind the shock .",
    "we set a coordinate system in the shocked fluid frame as shown in figure [ fig : magdir ] .",
    "the z - axis is the radial direction , in which the fluid moves .",
    "the ordered field is characterized by the strength @xmath34 and the direction @xmath35 .",
    "the axisymmetric tangled field is described by the field strength as a function of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the probability per unit solid angle @xmath38 . according to sari ( 1999 ) ,",
    "we adopt @xmath39 and @xmath40 . if @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and vice versa , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the tangled magnetic field components parallel and perpendicular to the z - axis , respectively .",
    "we parametrize the ratio of the ordered field to the tangled one by @xmath45 .",
    "the total strength @xmath46 is determined by the afterglow model in the next section .",
    "given a magnetic field geometry and the plasma parameters from the afterglow model , we can take an angular average of the coefficients and solve the transfer equation ( [ eq : trans ] ) to obtain the stokes parameters .",
    "although the shock structure may be important ( e.g. , ioka 2003 ) , we neglect it as a first step .",
    "we define the observed frequency as the frequency in the fluid frame multiplied by the lorentz factor of the fluid in the lab frame @xmath5 , whereas ratios of the stokes parameters are lorentz invariant .    if @xmath47 ( no ordered field ) , we can immediately find that @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 vanish as a result of the axisymmetry and reflection symmetry about the @xmath54 plane .",
    "_ therefore the tangled field alone can not generate cp_. intuitively this is because there is always an oppositely directed pair of magnetic fields , so that no handedness exists .",
    "first we consider the forward external shock with energy @xmath55 propagating into a constant surrounding density @xmath56 . according to the standard afterglow model ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) , the lorentz factor of the shocked fluid and the radius of the shock evolve as @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , where @xmath59 is the observer time .",
    "the shell thickness in the shocked fluid frame can be estimated by @xmath60 , which we use as the path length of the transfer equation ( [ eq : trans ] ) .",
    "we assume that electrons are accelerated in the shock to a power law distribution of lorentz factor @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the electron number density in the shocked fluid frame and @xmath65 .",
    "the minimum electron energy and the magnetic field strength in the shocked fluid frame are given by @xmath66(m_p / m_e ) \\gamma$ ] and @xmath67 , respectively , where the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 are fractions of shock energy that go into the electrons and the magnetic energy , respectively .",
    "thus we can calculate @xmath5 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath60 and @xmath72 as a function of @xmath59 for given @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we adopt @xmath76 erg , @xmath77 proton @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we temporarily neglect the jet effects .",
    "the typical synchrotron frequency is @xmath82 ghz where the convention @xmath83 is used except for @xmath84 day . for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we use equations ( [ eq : coef2 ] ) and ( [ eq : coef3 ] ) , respectively . by using equation ( [ eq : coef3 ] ) , we can estimate the self - absorption frequency from @xmath87 as @xmath88 ghz , where we put @xmath89 .",
    "the flux is given by @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "we can neglect the electron cooling for our interests .",
    "figure [ fig : cpfor ] illustrates cp from a forward shock .",
    "the degree of cp is about 1% at the self - absorption frequency @xmath95 and @xmath1 at optical for @xmath96 .",
    "we have found that the dependence of cp on @xmath59 and @xmath97 is weak , and the dependence on @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 is roughly @xmath102 ( see figure [ fig : magdir ] for the relation between @xmath103 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) .",
    "the cp is mainly due to intrinsic emission .",
    "next we consider the reverse shock propagating the ejected shell itself ( m@xmath8sz@xmath9ros & rees 1997 ; sari & piran 1999a ) .",
    "let @xmath104 and @xmath105 be an initial lorentz factor of the shell and the burst duration , respectively",
    ". then the lorentz factor at the shock crossing time is given by @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a critical lorentz factor ( kobayashi 2000 ; kobayashi & zhang 2003 ; zhang , kobayashi & m@xmath8sz@xmath9ros 2003 ; sari & piran 1999a , b ) .",
    "the shock crossing time is given by @xmath108 . at @xmath109 the minimum electron energy , the magnetic field strength and the electron number density in the shocked fluid frame are given by @xmath66(m_p / m_e )   \\gamma_{0}/\\gamma_{\\times}$ ] , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "after the shock crossing , these quantities approximately evolve as @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively ( kobayashi 2000 ; kobayashi & sari 2000 ) .",
    "the shell thickness in the shocked fluid frame is @xmath60 where @xmath116 .",
    "we adopt @xmath117 and @xmath118 s.    the typical synchrotron frequency is @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 $ ] ghz . using equation ( [ eq : coef2 ] ) we can estimate the self - absorption frequency from @xmath87 as @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath124 @xmath131 @xmath132 $ ] ghz , where we put @xmath133 . the flux peaks at @xmath134 .",
    "we can neglect the electron cooling for our interests .",
    "figure [ fig : cprev ] shows cp from a reverse shock . for @xmath96 , the degree of cp reaches @xmath2-@xmath135% at radio frequencies , and @xmath3-@xmath136% at optical . even if @xmath137 , cp remains to be @xmath138 1% at the self - absorption frequency @xmath95 .",
    "this is because of the fc .",
    "the intrinsic cp decreases as @xmath98 decreases , but @xmath24 is generated from @xmath26 and @xmath27 due to the fc .",
    "the dependence of cp on @xmath97 is weak .",
    "if fc is not effective , the dependence on @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 is roughly @xmath102 , while if fc is effective , it is not so simple .",
    "so far we have calculated cp at one point on the afterglow image on the sky .",
    "the integration over the entire emitting region may suppress the observed cp as in the case of lp ( sari 1999 ; ghisellini & lazzati 1999 ) .",
    "let us estimate the suppression factor when we observe a jet with an opening angle @xmath139 from a viewing angle @xmath140 .",
    "we consider the ordered magnetic field defined by @xmath35 in the coordinate with @xmath141-axis being the direction from the jet center to the line of sight on the sky and with @xmath142-axis being the direction in which the ejecta moves ( see figure [ fig : magdir ] ) .",
    "we assume that the viewable region is a uniform disk of angular extent @xmath143 centered around the line of sight to the observer , since the afterglow image is rather homogeneous for @xmath144 ( granot , piran & sari 1999a , b ) or after the jet break ( ioka & nakamura 2001 ) . then , if we assume @xmath145 and take the coordinate origin at the line of sight on the sky , the suppression factor is given by @xmath146/ \\int d\\theta d\\phi$ ] , where @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "interestingly , no cancellation takes place when @xmath149 or @xmath150 .",
    "even when the cancellation occurs , e.g , in the case of @xmath151 , some amount of cp remains if the visible region has an asymmetry due to the jet geometry as in the case of lp .",
