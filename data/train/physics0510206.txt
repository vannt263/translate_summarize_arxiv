    "the periodic motion exhibited by a simple pendulum is harmonic only for small angle oscillations.@xcite beyond this limit , the equation of motion is nonlinear .",
    "although an integral formula exists for the period of the nonlinear pendulum , it is usually not discussed in introductory physics classes because it is not possible to evaluate the integral exactly.@xcite for this reason almost all introductory physics textbooks and lab manuals discuss only small angle oscillations for which the approximation @xmath0 is valid .",
    "the linearized equation has a simple exact solution , whose derivation can be easily understood by first - year students.@xcite this linearization has bothered us since our own undergraduate days because the amplitude needs to be less than @xmath1 if an error less than 0.1% ( the typical experimental error obtained with a stopwatch ) is desired . measurements in undergraduate labs rarely have such small amplitudes,@xcite and interested students sometimes ask for a relation that can describe the increase of the period observed for large amplitudes.@xcite    the restriction to small angle oscillations hinders the understanding of real - world behavior because the pendulum isochronism observed in the small angle regime vanishes for increasing amplitudes .",
    "this restriction is also unnecessary because millisecond precision in measurements of the period is easily obtained with current technology.@xcite for instance , an experimental error of the order of 0.1% or less is typically obtained with a one meter - long pendulum , and thus accurate experimental studies of the dependence of the period on amplitude are possible even in introductory physics labs.@xcite    in this paper we derive a simple and accurate formula for the period of a pendulum oscillating beyond the small angle regime .",
    "the deviation from the exact results are of the same order of the experimental error .",
    "an ideal simple pendulum consists of a particle of mass @xmath2 suspended by a massless rigid rod of length @xmath3 that is fixed at the upper end such that the particle moves in a vertical circle .",
    "this simple mechanical system oscillates with a symmetric restoring force ( in the absence of dissipative forces ) due to gravity , as illustrated in fig .",
    "its equation of motion is given by@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the angular displacement in radians ( @xmath6 at the equilibrium position ) and @xmath7 is the local acceleration of gravity .",
    "for any given initial condition , the exact solution can only be obtained numerically ( with arbitrary accuracy ) . for small angle oscillations ,",
    "the approximation @xmath0 is valid and eq .",
    "( 1 ) becomes a linear differential equation analogous to the one for the simple harmonic oscillator . in this regime",
    "the pendulum oscillates with a period @xmath8 , a well - known textbook relation.@xcite this relation underestimates the exact period for any amplitude , but the difference is almost imperceptible for small angles . for larger angles @xmath9 becomes more and more inaccurate for describing the exact period and eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be used to obtain a numerical solution .",
    "alternatively , an integral expression for the exact pendulum period may be derived from energy considerations , without a detailed discussion of differential equations .",
    "if we take the zero of potential energy at the lowest point of the trajectory ( see fig .  1 ) and choose for simplicity the initial conditions as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we have@xcite @xmath12 the solution for @xmath13 is @xmath14 where the @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) sign is for counter - clockwise ( clockwise ) motion .",
    "now , integrating @xmath13 from @xmath17 to 0 ( thus choosing the @xmath16 sign in eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) , which corresponds to a time equal to one quarter of the exact period @xmath18 , we have @xmath19 the definite integral in eq .",
    "can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions.@xcite note that the numerical evaluation of the period using eq .",
    "is not straightforward because the integrand has a vertical asymptote at @xmath20 , which makes the integral improper.@xcite this difficulty can be circumvented by substituting @xmath21 by @xmath22 and making a change of variables given implicitly by @xmath23 . in this way , eq .",
    "( 4 ) becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the definite integral is @xmath26 , the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , which is not improper because @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "it is not difficult to numerically evaluate @xmath18 for a given amplitude .",
    "the relative error made in approximating @xmath18 by @xmath9 , where @xmath29 , is@xcite @xmath30    our proposed approximation for the pendulum period is based on the observation that @xmath31 is a smooth function of @xmath32 , whose concavity changes from downward to upward at a point near the middle of the interval of integration , that is , @xmath33 . as shown in fig .  2 , this change occurs for any @xmath17 between @xmath34 and @xmath35.@xcite we use the points @xmath36 and @xmath37 for a linear interpolation , where @xmath38 , and approximate @xmath39 by @xmath40 we substitute eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) in the denominator of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) and find @xmath41 finally , by substituting eq .   in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we found @xmath42    note that @xmath43 and hence @xmath44 for @xmath28 . the relative error in the logarithmic formula in eq .",
    "( 9 ) is given by@xcite @xmath45",
    "we compare the accuracy of our approximation for the pendulum period in eq .",
    "( [ eq : log ] ) in representing the exact period to that of other known approximations for amplitudes less than or equal to @xmath46.@xcite the relative errors found by approximating the exact period by @xmath9 and @xmath47 , as well as by other formulas , are depicted in fig .  3 , where it is easily seen that all approximations present the same general behavior : for small amplitudes their corresponding error curves tend to zero and for larger amplitudes the curves go up monotonically , reflecting the increase of the relative error with the amplitude obtained with all known approximation formulas . however , note that the rate at which the error increases is different for each curve , the smaller rate being the desired one for a good approximation . in this sense ,",
    "the small angle approximation @xmath48 exhibits the worst behavior because its error becomes greater than 0.1%(0.5% ) above an amplitude as low as @xmath1 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the second - order approximation found by bernoulli in 1749 from a perturbative analysis of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , perhaps the most famous formula for the large angle period , is @xcite @xmath50 as seen from the short - dashed line in fig .",
    "3 , it leads to an error that increases rapidly , overcoming the 0.1%(0.5% ) level for amplitudes above @xmath51(@xmath52 ) .",
    "the addition of more terms improves the accuracy of @xmath53.@xcite    more recently , other approximation formulas have been proposed . among them ,",
    "the kidd - fogg formula has attracted much interest due to its simplicity.@xcite it is given by @xmath54 the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "3 represents the error for @xmath55 . the error is greater than 0.1% only for amplitudes @xmath56 and reaches 0.8% for @xmath57",
    "thus , it is not accurate enough for interpreting the experimental data for very large - angle amplitudes , contrary to the claim of millet.@xcite    another formula for the period arises when an interpolation - like linearization is made directly in eq .",
    "( 1).@xcite the resulting expression is @xmath58 which has an error greater than 0.1% only for @xmath59 ( see the thin solid curve in fig .  3 ) .",
    "however , the error reaches @xmath60 for @xmath57 , which is four times the typical experimental error ( 0.1% ) .    the error using eq .   for the period ( see the thick solid line in fig .",
    "3 ) remains below all other error curves for any @xmath61 and is greater than 0.1% only for amplitudes greater than @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , it increases slowly , reaching only 0.2% for @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , our logarithmic formula is the better approximation for the exact pendulum period in the sense it yields the smaller relative error and also the smaller rate for the relative error increasing in the range of amplitudes studied here .",
    "reliable data for large - angle pendulum periods were obtained by fulcher and davis@xcite using a pendulum made with piano wire ( measuring two successive swings ) and by curtis@xcite who determined the period as the average of ten successive periods for each initial amplitude .",
    "both papers are good examples of accurate period measurements made with an ordinary stopwatch .",
    "the measurement of the time interval for @xmath64 successive periods is a good strategy for oscillations in the small angle regime , where the amplitude does not change significantly from a swing to the next , but not for large - angle oscillations , because the period decreases considerably due to air friction .",
    "this behavior is confirmed in fig .  4 , where the period @xmath18 in units of @xmath9 is plotted as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "4 the curves for each approximation formula discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : compare ] are plotted .",
    "experimental data taken from refs .   and and the measurements taken by us in a more sophisticated experiment@xcite are also shown .",
    "the experimental data for amplitudes greater than @xmath65 clearly reveal a systematic overestimation for the period due to air damping .    in our experiment both",
    "the time - keeping and position detection were done automatically to reduce the instrumental error to milliseconds , which is much less than the error in time keeping when a common stopwatch is used ( of the order of 0.2s , the average human reaction time ) .",
    "we measured the pendulum period by measuring the time interval between two successive passages of the pendulum over the lower point of its circular path , which corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "the measurement was based on the variation of the electrical resistance of a light - dependent resistor during the passing of the pendulum s bob through the path of the light from a laser.@xcite electronic circuitry is needed for converting the analogue signal generated in the light - dependent resistor when the pendulum s bob cuts the light s path to ttl compatible digital voltage , so that the microprocessor can understand the change in current .",
    "the details of the design / operation of the circuitry and the microprocessor program required for measuring the time interval between successive interruptions in the light - dependent resistor are in ref .  .",
    "we devoted much attention to the reduction of the air resistance on the motion of the pendulum bob by choosing suitable materials and parameters for the pendulum .",
    "we used lead as the bob material due to its high density in comparison to other inexpensive metals , which gives a small size and large weight for the bob .",
    "we found that a cylinder is preferable to a sphere because it allows for a better localization of the center of mass , which is needed for measuring @xmath3 accurately .",
    "the cylindrical shape also yields a reduction of air resistance by reducing the scattering cross - section , that is , by choosing a diameter much smaller than the height of the cylinder .",
    "these considerations led us to fabricate a body with a mass of 0.400 kg . for this massive bob",
    "we verified that cords made of nylon , a commonly used material , are inadequate because they stretch considerably for large angle oscillations and cause undesirable vibrations .",
    "the more convenient material taking into account low elasticity , lightness ( see ref .   for the importance of this factor ) , price , and availability , seems to be cotton .",
    "we used a common sewing thread as the pendulum cord .",
    "we also investigated what cord length would give the best experimental results for large angles.@xcite after comparing many lengths for an amplitude of @xmath52 , we choose a length of 1.50 m so that the bob speed would be small ( because air friction increases with speed , the longer the string length , the less the effect of air friction on the period ) this length has a period of @xmath67s , which is sufficiently small for doing several repetitions of the period measurement for each amplitude during a typical one - hour class .",
    "these considerations led us to much more accurate experimental data for the pendulum period for amplitudes less than or equal to @xmath68 as shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that our experimental data ( black diamonds ) are closer to the exact period expected in the absence of air resistance ( the solid line ) than the data in refs .",
    "( crosses ) and ( circles ) . the logarithmic formula in eq .",
    "is also in better agreement with the experimental data .",
