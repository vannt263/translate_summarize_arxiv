    "supersoft sources are a separate class of x - ray objects .",
    "the most popular explanation of these sources is a white dwarf & sub - giant companion with a high accretion rate , 1001000 times greater than in cataclysmic variables ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "the large accretion rate creates steady hydrogen burning on the white dwarf surface causing x - ray emission .",
    "supersoft sources are difficult to detect in the galaxy as the high column density in the galactic plane absorbs most of the soft x - ray radiation .",
    "consequently there have been many more detections at high galactic latitudes such as in the lmc , smc and m31 . as of 1999",
    "( greiner 2000 ) , there were 57 supersoft sources : 10 in the galaxy , 4 in the smc , 8 in the lmc and 34 in m31 and 1 in ngc 55 .",
    "consequently , even though sources in the lmc and smc are further away , they have been studied in greater detail due to their larger numbers .",
    "for example , in 1997 fender , southwell & tzioumis ( 1998 ) searched for radio emission from non - galactic supersoft sources despite them being prohibitively further away than their galactic counterparts .    of the persistent super - soft sources , three",
    "have been reported to have outflows , detected by emission lines in their optical and infrared spectra .",
    "what is the makeup of these sources , and are they the link between the low velocity jets seen in star - forming systems , and the superluminal jets seen in the microquasars ?",
    "three supersoft sources have been observed with weak doppler - shifted optical emission lines .",
    "the first object to be detected was rx  j0513.9@xmath46951 , an lmc object which was discovered during an outburst in 1990 ( schaeidt et al .",
    "1993 ) , and optically identified by pakull et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and cowley et al .",
    "this source has persistent optical emission with dips in the lightcurve every 100200 days ( southwell et al .",
    "the evidence for jets in this source comes from strong heii , h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 lines with doppler - shifted components at @xmath7 4000 km  s@xmath2 ( southwell et al .",
    "these lines are still observed during an optical dip , but with a reduced equivalent width , implying a reduction in the accretion rate .",
    "the second supersoft jet source to be detected was rx  j0019.8 + 2156 ( beuermann et al .",
    "1995 ) , a galactic object at 2 kpc consisting of a 1 m@xmath8 wd and a 1.5 m@xmath8 donor star ( becker et al .",
    "the optical spectrum shows strong heii emission and p  cygni absorption in the balmer lines .",
    "this source displays slower red and blue - shifted lines with velocities of @xmath7 815 km  s@xmath2 , but these lines have a high fwhm of 400 km  s@xmath2 ( tomov et al .",
    "quaintrell & fender ( 1998 ) have also found these features in infrared spectra .",
    "becker et al .  ( 1998 ) conclude that the jets in this system come from an inclined cone of material blown off from an accretion disc .",
    "the third , and last , supersoft source to be discovered with an outflow is the galactic source rx  j0925.7@xmath44758 .",
    "this was observed by motch ( 1998 ) over two nights in 1997 .",
    "spectra showed prominent h@xmath6 blue and red - shifted lines with a velocity of 5800 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "motch ( 1998 ) modelled the emission from a cone with a large opening angle , at low inclination , similar to rx  j0019 + 2156 .",
    "the only radio detection of a supersoft source was that of the symbiotic star ag  draconis ( torbett & campbell 1987 ; seaquist et al.1993 ) .",
    "observations with the vla showed two unresolved components separated by @xmath9 1 , at fluxes of 200 and 400 @xmath1jy , shown in figure [ vla_merlin](a ) .",
    "these authors conclude that the emission is from optically thick thermal free - free emission , based on the majority of symbiotic systems .",
    "however , we can not rule out optically thick emission in this paper .",
    "of the ten galactic supersoft sources , four were observed by the vla .",
    "these are rx  j0019.8 + 2156 , t  pyx , ag  draconis and v1974 cygni .",
    "three of these sources were observed with the vla with the exception of ag dra which was observed using merlin for the purpose of resolving any detail .",
    "as we were primarily concerned with initial detections of point sources , a standard continuum setup was used for both the vla and merlin observations . for the vla we used a 100 mhz bandwidth",
    "split into two channels , and for merlin we used a 15 mhz bandwidth split into 15 channels .",
    "individual channels were retained in order to reduce the amount of bandwidth smearing of sources offset from the phase - centre .",
    "t  pyx is a recurrent nova first discovered by leavitt ( 1914 ) at a distance of 1.5 kpc ( shara 1997 ; margon & deutsch 1998 ) . an arcsecond size optical nebula around the source , which shows a large amount of clumpy material on sub - arcsec scales , was detected from this object ( williams 1982 ; duerbeck & sitter 1987 ) .",
    "this clumpy material would provide a rich medium for interaction with an outflow , such as the 11001400 km  s@xmath2 jets reported by shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( however , this outflow probably originates in the surrounding nebular , and not in jets , see obrien & cohen ( 1998 ) and margon & deutsch ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "observations were taken using the vla in cnb configuration on 2000 march 3 , 0415 - 0615 ut at 8.4 ghz and in d configuration on 2000 september 26 & 28 , 1600 - 1710 & 1400 - 1630 ut respectively .",
    "data were calibrated using the standard flux calibrator 3c  147 , and phase calibrator pks  j0921@xmath42618 .",
    "no emission was observed from either the source , or any of the 7 surrounding sources from the simbad database .",
    "we can put a @xmath10 rms upper - limit of 22 @xmath1jy beam@xmath2 at 4.8 ghz , and 19 @xmath1jy beam@xmath2 at 8.4 ghz .",
    "an observing log , together with beam sizes , rms noise and source details for all sources is given in table [ observing log ] .",
    ".observation log and source details .",
    "please note that the merlin observations are only at 5 ghz and the two fluxes presented are for two components in the image .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     together with the mass - loss rate and equation [ wind_fluxes ] , the flux from the wind can be found .",
    "unfortunately , the expected fluxes are not as precise as one hopes as a large number of important parameters such as composition ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , wind temperature and velocity ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) are unknown .",
    "van teeseling & king ( 1998 ) consider heii to be the main absorber of the wd radiation , which has implications to the composition and temperature of the resulting wind .",
    "the temperature of the wind will range from the ionisation temperature of heii to the temperature of the incident radiation , so we use a wind temperature of @xmath16 in this paper",
    ". the composition of a purely heii wind would give values for the mean atomic weight @xmath17 , the electron to ion number density ratio @xmath18 and the ionic charge @xmath19 .",
    "it would be surprising if these were realistic values for the wind , but they are useful approximations and only enter the wind - flux equation ( [ wind_fluxes ] ) as @xmath20 and so , small changes would not have a large effect on the estimation . the final variable to estimate",
    "is the wind velocity , @xmath15 . vtk98",
    "approximate the velocity to be 0.3 times the isothermal sound speed . for sound speeds of the order @xmath21 km s@xmath2",
    "this would give approximate wind velocities of @xmath22 km s@xmath2 . using these approximations to the wind gives flux estimates at 5 ghz ( @xmath23 ) and 8.3 ghz ( @xmath24 ) shown in table [ system_parameters ] .",
    "we have tried to estimate the radio flux from a white dwarf wind , but the uncertainties are too large to confidently quote numbers . both bondi - hoyle and roche lobe overflow accretion can not be reliably used to predict the mass - transfer rate , and therefore the amount of excess material that the white dwarf can process is also undetermined .      from our merlin and vla observations we can provide the flux for ag draconis and upper limits to the fluxes of the other three supersoft sources in this paper ( presented in table [ system_parameters ] ) .",
    "given the spread in the observable system parameters , the expected flux for all three non - detected sources is at , or below the 5 @xmath0 cutoff for detections .",
    "the surprise in this analysis is with ag dra where we detect with merlin two unresolved point sources with a combined flux of @xmath3 1 mjy .",
    "this is much larger than both the wind flux and an evaporated wind at that frequency of around 10 - 20 @xmath1jy and so we can conclude either the assumptions used in these models are unrealistic , or a different emission mechanism is producing the observed radio flux",
    ".    it could be significant that the only detected fluxes originate from a k giant secondary rather than f or m dwarfs .",
    "the geometry and accretion in ag dra is not expected to be from roche lobe overflow , but rather from the wind of the agb secondary .",
    "we have searched for quiescent , persistent radio emission from the northern hemisphere supersoft x - ray sources , and taken a high resolution image of the one known source with emission .",
    "we have improved the radio positions , source size and flux from the persistent emitter ag dra with merlin .",
    "the core is resolved at the milliarcsec scale into two components with a combined flux of @xmath3 1000 @xmath1jy .",
    "it is possible that the core detected in the vla image has significant nebulosity and is resolved out by the higher merlin resolution .",
    "a possible south component detected by the vla was unconfirmed , although this could be due to it having a flux lower than the noise in the merlin image , or also being resolved out .    no new emission was detected from rx j0019.8 + 2156 , t pyx and v1974 cygni down to a 1@xmath0 rms noise level of around 20 @xmath1jy beam@xmath2 .",
    "no emission was detected from any previously known galactic or extragalactic source in the 3 , 104 square arcsec fields imaged , and we place upper - limits to radio emission from these sources .",
    "we have investigated possible causes of radio emission from a wind environment , both directly from the secondary star , and also as a consequence of the high x - ray luminosity from the wd .",
    "a total of 17 new point - sources were imaged with fluxes between 100 and 1500 @xmath1jy giving an estimate to the density of sources with a flux @xmath25 100 @xmath1jy of 200 per square degree , at 5 ghz , in this region of the sky .",
