    "over the past decade the ads / cft correspondence has received increasing attention and many studies have been made on it .",
    "it has been believed that the ads / cft correspondence plays a central role in the study of the strongly coupled region of quantum field theory because it is simply described by classical gravity theory on ads spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "recently , the duality between the superconductor and gravity theory has been proposed  @xcite as a new application of the ads / cft correspondence , in which the simplest gravity theory is given by einstein - maxwell - charged scalar theory with negative cosmological constant . in this gravity theory one of static solutions",
    "is the well - known reissner - nordstrm - ads black hole solution , in which the scalar field vanishes .",
    "it is known that this solution is unstable when the temperature @xmath0 is lower than a critical temperature @xmath1 . in consequence of the instability",
    ", it is expected that the scalar field will condense into a non - vanishing profile and eventually the black hole will have the scalar hair breaking the @xmath5-gauge symmetry spontaneously . for low temperature @xmath2 , such a static solution has been constructed numerically .",
    "it was shown that the solution has similar properties with superconductors  @xcite .",
    "thus , the instability of the reissner - nordstrm - ads black hole for low temperature was identified with the superconducting phase transition . in the same way ,",
    "the reissner - nordstrm - ads and hairy black holes in the gravitational theory were identified with the normal and superconducting phases of a superconductor realized within the dual field theory , respectively .",
    "such holographic superconductors are considered as a hopeful approach to understand the property of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the non - equilibrium process of strongly correlated systems such as superconductors is not fully understood because of difficulties in its theoretical treatment , and has been attracting much attention  @xcite . the ads / cft correspondence offers a novel approach to this longstanding problem . to understand non - equilibrium process of strongly correlated systems",
    ", we should simply solve classical dynamics of gravitational systems in the bulk thanks to the duality .",
    "many attempts in this direction have been done to get insights for strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma , relativistic hydrodynamics and so on  @xcite . for near equilibrium dynamics of superconductor ,",
    "there are several approaches from the holography .",
    "for example , transport coefficients , such as the electric conductivity , were obtained by the linear response theory  @xcite .",
    "( see also  @xcite and references therein . )",
    "the static and dynamic critical phenomena were also studied in  @xcite .",
    "these studies played important rolls in understanding the holographic superconductor .",
    "however , very little progress has been made in the regime that the theory is far from equilibrium . in this paper , we give a holographic approach to understand the non - equilibrium process of superconductors .    as we mentioned before , for low temperature @xmath2 there are two phases of black holes in the gravity side , the reissner - nordstrm - ads and the hairy black holes , and they are regarded as supercooled normal phase and superconducting phases , respectively . in this paper , we consider small perturbations on the supercooled reissner - nordstrm - ads black holes and study non - linear time evolution of them . because of the instability of the reissner - nordstrm - ads black holes , the initial perturbations will grow exponentially at the beginning of the time evolution .",
    "it is expected that the exponential growth is saturated due to the non - linear effect and the spacetimes will approach static solutions .",
    "it is believed that the final states of the time evolution are the hairy black holes obtained in  @xcite , but there is no proof . studying non - linear time evolutions of the einstein - maxwell - charged scalar system , we will show that the final states are given by the hairy black holes .",
    "we are also interested in dynamics of the phase transition on the boundary theory . to reveal the non - equilibrium process",
    ", we observe the time dependence of the superconducting order parameter and study how the normal phase goes to superconducting phase in the boundary theory in the middle of the time evolution .",
    "we also evaluate the relaxation time scale of the boundary theory .",
    "finally , we study the time evolution of event and apparent horizons and discuss the correspondence with the entropy of the boundary theory .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : eom ] , we introduce the gravity theory of the holographic superconductor and give equations of motion . assuming the plane symmetry , we obtain the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "we also give the outline of our calculations . in section  [ sec : asym ] , we solve the equations of motion near the ads boundary in order to obtain boundary conditions at the ads boundary . in section  [ sec : method ] , we explain the numerical method to solve the equations of motion . in section  [ sec : result ] , we give the numerical results of non - linear time evolution .",
    "we find that the final states of the time evolutions coincide with the hairy black holes for general initial conditions . in the middle of time evolution",
    ", we study the time dependence of superconducting order parameters and measure the relaxation time of them . the time evolutions of event and apparent",
    "horizons are also studied .",

    "thus , it is quite likely that we can regard the area of the horizon as the entropy at the initial state .",
    "this issue will be examined further in the following subsection .",
    "the time evolution of the area of event and apparent horizons are depicted for @xmath150 and @xmath180 at the initial state .",
    "solid and dashed curves correspond to the area of event and apparent horizons respectively.,height=340 ]      having shown properties of the horizons in the bulk , we will discuss how to identify the bulk with the boundary based on observations of the bulk field dynamics . when the system is stationary , we know that the area of the black hole horizon in the bulk corresponds to the entropy of the dual boundary theory",
    ". however , there is subtlety in this correspondence for dynamical systems ( see , for example ,  @xcite and so on ) .",
    "when the system is dynamical , we do not know the mapping between horizons and ads boundary _ a priori_. in other words , there exists ambiguity of the time slices with which we identify the horizon and the boundary .",
    "the null time slices we used in this paper , which are illustrated in figure  [ fig : ponchi ] , is nothing but one of the uncountable set of time slices .",
    "thus , we can not immediately assert that figure  [ fig : hors ] is equivalent to the dynamics of the entropy in the dual theory . in this subsection",
    ", we would like to discuss this issue of the identification    figure  [ fig : static ] shows time dependence of a metric function @xmath68 . in this figure",
    ", we show the value of @xmath181 in gray - scale .",
    "the dark region , in which @xmath181 is large , represents non - stationary region . rigorously speaking",
    ", this figure indicates to what extent a coordinate vector @xmath182 satisfies the killing equation : @xmath183 .",
    "the quantity @xmath184 is , however , not always a good indicator of non - equilibrium property since @xmath185 coincides with the timelike killing vector on the ads boundary and @xmath186 tends to zero there . in order to examine non - staticity even at the boundary , we focus on the value of @xmath187 instead of @xmath188 ( see eq .",
    "( [ coeff ] ) ) . as we mentioned before ,",
    "the initial state and the final state are close to equilibrium .",
    "it turns out that this fact appears also in figure  [ fig : static ] .",
    "another point we should note is that the shaded region extends almost vertically in this figure .",
    "since we are using null time - slicing , the above fact means that the non - stationary region extends along the ingoing null direction from the boundary to the horizon in the bulk spacetime .",
    "consequently , it may be reasonable to suppose that the mapping between quantities of the boundary and the horizon is given by the null time slices in the current case",
    ". it will be interesting to examine whether we can apply this idea to other dynamical systems .    .",
    "the value of @xmath181 is plotted in gray - scale , in which the dark part represents the non - stationary region . in order to examine non - staticity of the entire bulk including the near - boundary region , we have focused on @xmath187 , which takes finite value even on the ads boundary , rather than on @xmath188 .",
    "the dashed curve represents the apparent horizon . ]",
    "we studied the non - equilibrium condensation process in the holographic superconductor by solving the time evolutions of the einstein - maxwell - charged scalar system in the asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "we considered small perturbations on the reissner - nordstrm - ads black holes , which are static solutions of this system , as the initial states .",
    "we found that , when the temperature is lower than the critical temperature @xmath1 , initial perturbations grow exponentially and the spacetimes settle into the hairy black holes obtained in  @xcite .",
    "it is concluded that the hairy black holes are the final states for the instability of the low - temperature reissner - nordstrm - ads black holes .",
    "we also found that the hairy black holes are stable against the plane - symmetric perturbations .",
    "as for the superconducting order parameter in the boundary theory , we clarified how it evolve in non - equilibrium process during the phase transition .",
    "as a byproduct , we obtained the relaxation time scale of the order parameter , which is inverse of the imaginary part of the fundamental quasi - normal mode .",
    "finally , we studied the time evolution of the event and apparent horizons and discussed the their relevance to the entropy of the boundary theory .",
    "there are many extensions and open issues .",
    "one of them is perturbation of dynamical spacetimes obtained in this paper .",
    "the dynamics of transport coefficients , such as electrical conductivity or shear viscosity , can be known from the perturbations on the dynamical spacetimes . from the dirac field perturbation",
    ", we may be able to study the fermi surface properties of superconductors  @xcite .",
    "these studies might deepen our understanding on dynamical phenomena in the ads / cft correspondence as well as on unknown properties of condensed matter system in non - equilibrium state .    in our calculations",
    ", we imposed the plane symmetry , that is , we assumed that the space on @xmath189-plane is homogeneous and isotropic , as in eq .",
    "( [ plane_sym ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to relax this symmetry .",
    "for example , we can consider the spacetime with homogeneous and anisotropic @xmath189-plane as @xmath190 the equations of motion for this metric ansatz are given by @xmath191-dimensional pdes , and thus we can straightforwardly apply the formalism of this paper . in this setting , we can take into account homogeneous electric or magnetic fields along the @xmath192 or @xmath193-directions and study the dynamics of the current in the boundary theory .",
    "more challenging problem is to take into account inhomogeneity along one direction , e.g. , the @xmath193-direction .",
    "the equations of motion are given by @xmath194-dimensional pdes . in the setting",
    ", we may holographically realize a system in which the temperature is not homogeneous and the condensed phase and the non - condensed phase coexist .",
    "in such an inhomogeneous system , we may observe the thermoelectric phenomena in superconductors  @xcite , such as pertier effect or the zeebeck effect , or the dynamics of the surface between the two phases  @xcite .",
    "another subject which can be studied by @xmath194-dimensional pdes is the vortex solution obtained in  @xcite : we must consider the @xmath5-symmetric spacetime where the @xmath5 is the rotational symmetry around the vortex .",
    "the spacetime of the vortex solution has a @xmath5-symmetry , which is the rotational symmetry around the vortex , and then the equations of motion are again given by @xmath194-dimensional pdes .",
    "investigation on the non - equilibrium phenomena in these inhomogeneous system and their comparison with theories and experiments in the field of the condensed matter physics may be interesting .    ultimately , we should study dynamics of spacetimes without any symmetry .",
    "such a task may be tackled only by numerical relativity technique , which is developing rapidly these days  @xcite . to apply this technique to asymptotically ads spacetime",
    ", we have to modify the formalism for asymptotically flat spacetime to accommodate the negative cosmological constant .",
    "if such a technique is established , we will be able to investigate on many interesting subjects concerning the non - equilibrium condensation process in the ads / cft .",
    "for example , it is expected that vortex lattice  @xcite are formed in a dynamical system from the simulation of the ( non - holographic ) superconducting system  @xcite . by simulating its holographic dual in the gravity side using the technique",
    ", we will be able to confirm further the ads / cft correspondence in a dynamical setup and also may clarify unknown properties of dynamical strongly - coupled systems .",
    "we believe that such studies will be fruitful for both of the quantum field theory and general relativity , and our study in this paper will serve as a first step toward such ambitious future issues .",
