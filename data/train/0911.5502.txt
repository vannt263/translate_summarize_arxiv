    "due to the enormous experimental progress in the investigation of nanoelectronic and molecular systems , one of the central issues of theoretical condensed matter physics is the understanding of nonequilibrium phenomena in small strongly correlated quantum systems coupled to an environment .",
    "traditionally such systems were investigated in the context of dissipative quantum mechanics , where energy exchange of a few - level system with a single bath of phonons was considered.@xcite with the realization of various devices involving metallic islands@xcite , quantum dots@xcite , single molecules@xcite , or quantum wires@xcite , a tunneling coupling to leads was realized , which enabled the controlled study of local quantum systems coupled via particle exchange to the environment .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of several leads , it became possible to study such systems in the presence of a finite bias voltage or temperature gradients ( inhomogeneous boundary conditions ) , i.e. a nonequilibrium and current - carrying state can be realized in the stationary situation .",
    "whereas in equilibrium there are powerful numerical and analytical techniques to describe linear transport or spectral properties of mesoscopic systems , the available methods in nonequilibrium are quite restrictive and still under development in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "exact solutions exist for some special cases@xcite .",
    "scattering bethe - ansatz solutions have been applied to the interacting resonant level model @xcite and the anderson impurity model @xcite , but the full understanding of the stationary state in all regimes has not yet been reached . to describe the steady state in the presence of a finite bias voltage , numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) methods using scattering waves",
    "@xcite , time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( td - dmrg ) @xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) with complex chemical potentials @xcite , and an approach based on iterative summation of path - integrals ( ispi ) ( ref .  )",
    "have been developed , but the efficiency of these methods is still not satisfactory in the regimes of strong coulomb interaction and/or large bias voltage . to calculate the time evolution into the stationary state , numerical techniques such as td - nrg,@xcite td - dmrg , ispi,@xcite and qmc in nonequilibrium@xcite have been used , as well as a fock space formulation of the multilayer multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree theory@xcite .",
    "however , the description of finite bias or the long - time limit still remains difficult .",
    "perturbation expansions in the coupling between the local system and the reservoirs or in the coulomb interaction on the local system can not cover the most interesting regime of quantum fluctuations and strong correlations at very low temperatures . to improve them significantly , the most promising analytic approaches are perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) methods for nonequilibrium systems .",
    "several methods have been proposed , which differ significantly concerning the extent up to which nonequilibrium aspects are taken into account and how the perturbative expansion in the renormalized vertices is set up .",
    "one of the first formally exact nonequilibrium rg methods for zero - dimensional quantum systems ( quantum dots ) was developed in refs .   and is called the real - time renormalization group method ( rtrg ) .",
    "this technique is based on an expansion in the renormalized coupling between quantum system and reservoir , whereas the correlations on the local system are taken exactly into account . later on , this method was formulated in pure frequency space and combined with a cutoff procedure on the imaginary frequency axis ( introduced in ref .  ) , the so - called rtrg - fs method @xcite . within this technique it was possible to solve analytically the generic problem how rg flows are cut off by the physics of transport rates .",
    "furthermore , it was demonstrated how all static and dynamic properties can be calculated analytically for the nonequilibrium kondo model in weak coupling @xcite and for the interacting resonant level model ( irlm ) in the scaling limit @xcite , which are two fundamental models for the physics of spin and charge fluctuations , respectively .",
    "another perturbative rg method in nonequilibrium ( called prg - ne ) , which also expands in the reservoir - system coupling , was developed in refs .  , where the slave particle approach was used in connection with keldysh formalism and quantum boltzmann equations .",
    "in these works it was investigated for the first time how the voltage and the magnetic field cuts off the rg flow for the kondo model and how the frequency dependence of the vertices influences various logarithmic contributions for the susceptibility and the nonlinear conductance .",
    "a real - frequency cutoff was used and the rg was formulated purely on one part of the keldysh - contour disregarding diagrams connecting the upper with the lower branch .",
    "this procedure turns out to be sufficient for the kondo model to calculate logarithmic terms in leading order but the cutoff by relaxation and decoherence rates was included intuitively ( recently an improved version of this method included parts of the spin relaxation and decoherence rates via self - energy insertions @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative microscopic approach to rtrg - fs for combining relaxation and decoherence rates within a nonequilibrium rg method for the kondo model was proposed in ref .  , where flow - equation methods @xcite were generalized to the nonequilibrium situation .",
    "within this method , it was shown for the kondo model that the cutoff of the rg flow by spin relaxation / decoherence rates occurs due to a competition of 1-loop and 2-loop terms on the r.h.s .",
    "of the rg equation for the vertex .",
    "whereas all of these perturbative rg methods are very successful , they have two important drawbacks .",
    "first , they expand all in the reservoir - system coupling and thus can only be used reliably in the regime of weak spin or orbital fluctuations ( strong charge fluctuations seem to be covered by rtrg - fs as was demonstrated recently for the irlm in ref .  ) . secondly , the rtrg - fs and the prg - ne scheme work in a basis of the many - particle eigenfunctions of the isolated local quantum system . as a consequence larger systems such as multi - level quantum dots , large molecules , or the crossover to the quantum wire case",
    "can not be addressed due to an exponentially large number of relevant many - particle states .",
    "therefore , another class of perturbative rg methods in nonequilibrium have been developed which are based on an expansion in the renormalized coulomb interaction on the local quantum system by combining the keldysh formalism with a quantum - field theoretical formulation of functional rg within the 1-particle irreducible wetterich scheme @xcite .",
    "in the following we call this approach the frg - ne method . it has been proposed and applied to transport through quantum dots and quantum wires in refs .  .",
    "similar implementations of the method have been developed for the application to bulk systems , investigating for instance quantum criticality in nonequilibrium@xcite or the long - time evolution of a bose gas starting from a nonequilibrium state@xcite . since the method is non - perturbative in the reservoir - system coupling and",
    "is parametrized in terms of single - particle states , it has the advantage that the case of low voltage and temperature can be described and it can be applied to multi - level quantum dots and quantum wires , at least if coulomb interactions are moderate .",
    "so far , the frg - ne scheme was used in approximation schemes with frequency independent self - energy .",
    "this approach describes reliably the leading effects of weak interactions in an effective single - particle picture . at higher interactions the decay rates generated by inelastic effects of the interaction are no longer negligible and",
    "may drastically change the behaviour of the system .",
    "these effects can only be described on the level of a frequency dependent self - energy , which is the subject of the present paper .",
    "we will address the problem of enhancing the level of the truncation scheme used in frg - ne , in order to enable it to describe interaction induced decay rates .",
    "the flow equations for the vertex functions are of such a structure that a frequency dependent self - energy can only result from a frequency dependent two - particle vertex .",
    "this is in turn a very complicated object , depending on four frequency , state and keldysh indices .",
    "conservation laws for spin , momentum , and frequency , and the symmetry properties of the vertex function discussed in ref .   can be used to reduce the complexity of the problem .",
    "nevertheless , the two - particle vertex function remains so complicated that it seems preferable to develop the methodology first for a physical system with as few interacting degrees of freedom as possible .",
    "this restricts at least the dimensionality of the state dependence of the vertex function .",
    "insight gained at this level can later be used to tackle larger systems .",
    "we choose to investigate the single impurity anderson model@xcite ( siam ) which is considered to be a generic model for strong local correlations@xcite and is a minimal model to study the interplay of charge and spin fluctuations .",
    "it consists of a single - level quantum dot with two spin states and on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath2 , which is coupled to leads .",
    "experimentally , it can be realized for small quantum dots or molecules . in the coulomb - blockade regime , this model is equivalent to the kondo model@xcite and the unitarity limit of the kondo effect has been measured@xcite .",
    "the perturbation theory of this model in @xmath2 is completely regular@xcite .",
    "however , the low energy behaviour at large interaction @xmath2 is governed by the so called kondo scale@xcite which is exponentially small in @xmath2 and hence can not be described in any finite order perturbation theory .",
    "this makes the model an interesting object for rg studies .",
    "since the model can be described in equilibrium very accurately by the numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite and even exact results for thermodynamic properties are available from bethe - ansatz@xcite there is the possibility to benchmark our results at least in equilibrium .    in case of thermal equilibrium",
    "the matsubara frg has so far been applied to the siam in two distinct formulations .",
    "one of them is a recent study based on hubbard - stratonovich fields representing spin fluctuations@xcite .",
    "the frg - ne implementation presented in this paper does not pursue this idea but is based on a weak coupling expansion analogously to the second class of equilibrium frg studies of the siam@xcite .",
    "these studies in turn have been done in two different truncation schemes .",
    "one of those schemes reduces the flow of the two - particle vertex to a renormalization of the static interaction strength and produces a frequency independent self - energy .",
    "this approximation is able to reproduce a kondo scale exponentially small in @xmath2 which appears e.g. in the pinning of the level to the chemical potential@xcite .",
    "it turned out to be a quite powerful tool for the description of static properties of diverse quantum dot geometries even at fairly large interactions  @xcite .",
    "the approximation is however unable to describe finite frequency properties .",
    "its restriction becomes manifest very clearly in the shape of the spectral function : the approximation of a static self - energy leads to a lorentzian resonance peak .",
    "the sharp kondo resonance , the side bands , the suppression of the kondo resonance with temperature are features which can not be described in principle by the static approximation .",
    "the second more elaborate approximation scheme which has been used within the weak - coupling equilibrium frg keeps the frequency dependence of the two - particle vertex function and neglects the three - particle vertex  @xcite .",
    "it yields quantitatively good results for small to intermediate interaction strengths .",
    "while finite frequencies properties are accessible to this frequency dependent frg approximation for not too large interactions , it has been observed that the large interaction asymptotics of this refined version are worse than the ones found in the static frg ; no kondo scale exponentially small in @xmath2 has been found  @xcite .",
    "also a technical disadvantage related to the use of the matsubara formalism becomes apparent : while the self - energy data are quite accurate on the imaginary frequency axis for small and intermediate @xmath2 , the analytic continuation to the real axis was instable for nonzero temperatures , working only for certain parameter sets",
    ". therefore only observables which are accessible from the imaginary frequency axis ( without resorting to analytic continuation ) can be systematically studied at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "this finding is an additional motivation to study a frequency dependent frg within the keldysh formalism , being formulated on the real frequency axis from the outset .",
    "apart from the possibility to access real frequency properties at finite temperature we envisage the opportunity to analyze the non - equilibrium behaviour of the siam .",
    "this has been recently in the focus of diverse publications . among them",
    "is also a non - equilibrium frg study that is based on a real - frequency cut - off and a static approximation scheme  @xcite ; results known from the matsubara frg could be partially reproduced by this method .",
    "it suffers however from the violation of causality related to the choice of the real - frequency cut - off .",
    "references   present perturbative studies that apply to moderate interactions and the special situation of particle - hole symmetry and vanishing magnetic field .",
    "the rtrg method was used in ref .   to describe the mixed valence and empty - orbital regime of the siam at finite bias .",
    "the results seem to be reliable but it was not possible to study the kondo regime since essential processes describing spin fluctuations were neglected . in ref .",
    "a time independent description of non - equilibrium based on a density operator for the steady state is used to make the problem accessible to qmc .",
    "the main challenge of this method is the numerical analytic continuation of two imaginary quantities to the real axis .",
    "a recent improvement of nonequilibrium qmc applied to the siam at zero magnetic field and zero gate voltage@xcite has given reliable results for @xmath3 ( in our notation @xmath4 denotes the level broadening , i.e. @xmath5 is the full width at half maximum of the noninteracting spectral density ) for the dot occupation and the nonlinear current . the ispi approach  @xcite provides an access to the current through the system for moderate @xmath2 and not too low temperatures .",
    "a very promising tool is the recently introduced scattering states nrg  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the results for the conductance obtained by this method still bear a considerable numerical uncertainty .",
    "spataru et al .",
    "@xcite generalized the gw approximation to non - equilibrium and concentrate on the coulomb blockade regime of the model .",
    "the td - dmrg technique  @xcite tries to access the steady state transport features of the model from the transient regime .",
    "data of the ispi and the td - dmrg methods for the current at moderate interactions have been found to agree very well with our frg results.@xcite    in contrast to many other methods , we propose in this paper a very flexible approach which provides reliable results for moderate interactions @xmath6 . in equilibrium , we will show that the linear conductance agrees very well with nrg data at finite gate voltage , magnetic field , and temperature .",
    "in nonequilibrium at finite bias @xmath7 , the nonlinear current @xmath8 is found to agree very well with td - dmrg data  @xcite .",
    "this provides the main evidence that our results can be trusted also for the nonlinear conductance @xmath9 at finite magnetic field @xmath10 and finite temperature @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , at @xmath12 , we find that our results for @xmath9 do not show anomalous peaks as obtained within fourth order perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that even the exponentially small scale of the kondo temperature can be identified in the second order derivative of the self - energy and the various fermi - liquid relations are reproduced",
    ". however , the effective mass still does not contain an exponentially small scale leading to a too large broadening of the spectral density for interaction strengths @xmath13 , in line with the equilibrium matsubara frg@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] introduces the model and its treatment within keldysh formalism . in section",
    "[ sec : frg ] we recapitulate the core elements of the frg for irreducible vertex functions .",
    "a motivation and discussion of the choice of hybridization as flow parameter follow in section  [ sec : flow_parameter ] . in section  [ sec : basic_approx ] we describe the more basic frequency independent approximation of the flow equations and show that in the case of equilibrium and zero temperature we reproduce exactly the flow equations known from the matsubara frg .",
    "section  [ sec : adv_approx ] is then devoted to the frg in frequency dependent approximation .",
    "there are three channels contributing to the flow of the two - particle vertex , and all three need to be taken into account .",
    "we describe an approximation scheme that simplifies the functional form in which the two - particle vertex depends on frequencies . in section  [ sec : apprb ] we demonstrate that the frg approach in the chosen truncation and approximation scheme preserves the fermi - liquid relations for the ( imaginary part of the ) self - energy ; furthermore we determine the frg estimate for the fermi - liquid coefficients .",

    "in particular , we obtained very good agreement for the nonlinear current @xmath8 with td - dmrg data at the most critical point @xmath441 . together with the fact that our equilibrium results agree well with nrg at finite magnetic field and finite temperature",
    ", we expect our results for the nonlinear conductance @xmath9 to be reliable at finite @xmath11 and @xmath10 , although no firm benchmark has yet been obtained by other techniques .",

    "frg the static self - energy feedback into the flow is preferable to the feedback of the full one , as opposed to the matsubara frg . and",
    "while the matsubara frg yields better results for the form of the spectral function at the particle - hole symmetric point , the keldysh frg produces better data for the linear conductance as function of gate voltage , making accessible finite temperatures where the matsubara frg is handicapped by the problem of analytic continuation .    in total",
    "our investigation gave insight on how a frequency dependent approximation to the keldysh frg can be constructed , and produced a flexible method to compute properties of the anderson impurity model for moderate interactions .",
    "a fundamental problem of applying the frg in the considered truncation scheme to this model is that the justification for the performed approximations can only be given by perturbative arguments .",
    "this difficulty is rooted in the regular perturbative expansion of the model .",
    "this contrasts with the situation in models with low energy divergencies which typically allow to distinguish relevant and irrelevant contributions to the rg flow by power counting .",
    "it would be interesting to figure out whether perturbative rg techniques are still capable to capture the exponentially small scale of the kondo temperature in the effective mass for large coulomb interactions . within our proposed approximation scheme",
    ", this scale already appeared in the second order derivative of the self - energy , showing that our perturbative rg scheme has the potential to extract such scales .",
    "therefore , it might appear possible that certain contributions from the 3-particle vertex can help to reveal the same scale for the effective mass as well .",
    "we expect that the approximation can be systematically improved by including the influence of higher order vertices on the flow , if care is taken to formulate the approximation scheme in accordance with ward identities",
    ". it might be also interesting to access the kondo limit of the anderson model using an approach based on hubbard - stratonovich fields decomposition as proposed in ref .   in combination with nonequilibrium frg .    in summary",

    "<S> we investigate nonequilibrium properties of the single impurity anderson model by means of the functional renormalization group ( frg ) within keldysh formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we present how the level broadening @xmath0 can be used as flow parameter for the frg . </S>",
    "<S> this choice preserves important aspects of the fermi liquid behaviour that the model exhibits in case of particle - hole symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> an approximation scheme for the keldysh frg is developed which accounts for the frequency dependence of the two - particle vertex in a way similar but not equivalent to a recently published approximation to the equilibrium matsubara frg . </S>",
    "<S> our method turns out to be a flexible tool for the study of weak to intermediate on - site interactions @xmath1 . in equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> we find excellent agreement with nrg results for the linear conductance at finite gate voltage , magnetic field , and temperature . in nonequilibrium </S>",
    "<S> , our results for the current agree well with td - dmrg . for the nonlinear conductance as function of the bias voltage , we propose reliable results at finite magnetic field and finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate the exponentially small scale of the kondo temperature to appear in the second order derivative of the self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the approximation is , however , not able to reproduce the scaling of the effective mass at large interactions . </S>"
