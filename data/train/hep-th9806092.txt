    "recently , following the ideas of @xcite , it has become possible to investigate non - perturbative properties of supersymmetric gauge theories by studying brane configurations in string and m theory @xcite .",
    "however , constructing chiral @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories has proven more difficult .",
    "several classes of chiral gauge theories were constructed in refs .",
    "an interesting development appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "it was shown that in the limit of vanishing string coupling it is possible to construct a large class of chiral theories ( including models known to exhibit dynamical supersymmetry breaking ) .",
    "one would like to understand the dynamics of these brane constructions at non - zero coupling . in this paper",
    ", we take a step in this direction and discuss some of the properties of the brane configurations introduced in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall the setup of the model .",
    "following @xcite , we consider field theory on d5-branes with world - volume in dimensions @xmath1 . to obtain a four - dimensional low energy effective theory ,",
    "we need these d - branes to be finite in two dimensions . therefore we will let them end on ns5-branes with world volume in @xmath2 and 5-branes with world - volume in @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to dimensional reduction from 6 to 4 dimensions , the inclusion of ns - branes also reduces the amount of supersymmetry to @xmath0 , and in general gives rise to chiral theories .",
    "the basic configuration with one gauge group is shown in figure [ fig : general ] .",
    "if we put @xmath4 d5-branes of finite extent into the box we obtain an @xmath5 gauge theory , while product group theories arise from configurations with several finite boxes .",
    "if we add ( semi - infinite ) d5-branes to the surrounding boxes this will give rise to matter in the fundamental representation given by strings between `` flavor '' and `` color '' d - branes as shown in figure [ fig : general ] . by convention",
    ", incoming arrows correspond to anti - fundamental fields , while outgoing arrows correspond to fundamental fields ( the same rules apply to the determination of charges under global symmetries ) .",
    "it is also possible to introduce more general matter content by adding d7-branes and orientifold 7-planes to the configuration .",
    "the original @xcite construction was done for zero string coupling . in this limit , one did not have to worry about the intersection of the d5 and ns- or -branes ; all branes are orthogonal .",
    "it is much more interesting if one can understand the bending of the branes at nonzero coupling .",
    "this is important because it should somehow reflect the dynamics of the field theories they represent .",
    "here we should distinguish between bending from perturbative and non - perturbative effects ; we will only address the former in this paper .",
    "a further motivation for the investigation of brane - bending is that it can potentially provide restrictions on the class of allowed theories .",
    "this is important because it appears that arbitrary configurations of the type described above ( including those leading to anomalous field theories ) are allowed .    in the case of weak coupling",
    ", it is possible to consider the bending of the ns- ( - ) branes and check if there exist continuous non - intersecting solutions . a first step in this direction",
    "was made in @xcite .",
    "it was required that asymptotically ( for large values of @xmath6 ) the angle under which the -branes bend ( and their @xmath7 coordinate ) should be independent of the @xmath8 coordinate on the brane ( an analogous conditions on the ns - brane bending did not lead to an independent constraint ) .",
    "the constraint required that : @xmath9 while these conditions are sufficient to guarantee anomaly freedom , they also allowed only theories with @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the constraints imposed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ggconstraint ] ) do not allow theories to flow in parameter space to pure @xmath0 sym ; neither do they allow one to construct sym theory itself , which is rather unsatisfactory .",
    "in this paper we will show that the conditions of @xcite are too restrictive by demonstrating the existence of smooth solutions to the brane bending problem .",
    "the existence of such solutions is to be expected given the new configurations proposed in @xcite which avoid this restriction , though it was not explicitly demonstrated there why the conditions of @xcite are unnecessary .",
    "the only constraint we derive from bending arises from restricting brane intersections .",
    "unfortunately , while our `` relaxed '' conditions will exclude some anomalous models , in general anomalous theories are still permitted .",
    "therefore , it remains an open question to find consistency conditions on the brane - box configurations ( or understand how anomalies can be cancelled due to the inflow from the bulk theory in the spirit of @xcite ) .",
    "presumably this problem is solved by a better understanding of the underlying string degrees of freedom of the theory .",
    "we will also show a connection between the running of the gauge coupling constant and the bending of the branes .",
    "we will first argue that in some simple configurations , the bending is logarithmic at large distances from the brane intersections , reflecting 4-dimensional physics . while we do not yet know the detailed connection between the running of the coupling constant and the brane bending in general cases",
    ", we will argue that the brane bending correctly reflects the leading term in the beta function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ bending ] we will find solutions for the brane bending in several illustrative cases and show that there exist smooth solutions for the brane in general configurations . in section [ restriction ] we will discuss what restrictions might be imposed on brane - box configurations from the requirement that the ns- ( - ) branes do not intersect over a 4-dimensional surface . in section [ sec : run ]",
    "we will discuss how the logarithmic running of the 4-dimensional gauge coupling is reflected in the bending of the ns- ( - ) branes in some simple configurations . in section [",
    "sec : beta ] we will argue that for general configurations the beta function is encoded in the bending of the branes . we summarize our results in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "consider an -brane in flat space .",
    "its dynamics is governed by a dirac - nambu - goto type action .",
    "its equation of motion derived from the action is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the induced metric @xmath13 .",
    "the equation reduces to the flat space laplace equation whenever @xmath12 is constant and proportional to the identity .",
    "if some other branes end on the ns - brane they will act as sources for the laplace equation and modify the right hand side of ( [ dbi ] ) .    now consider a d5-brane ending on an -brane . as a result the -brane will buckle in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "because of symmetry , the @xmath7 coordinate of the -brane depends only on @xmath6 , the distance from the d5-brane end point inside the -brane .",
    "consequently , for large values of @xmath6 ( far away from the region where the source is strong ) , the buckling is determined by the one dimensional flat space laplace equation @xcite .",
    "the solution is given by : @xmath14 where @xmath4 is the number of d5-branes and @xmath15 is the proportionality constant which vanishes in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "( note that we have chosen integration constants differently from @xcite so that the configuration is more symmetric ; see figure [ fig : fived ] ) .    if the d5-branes also terminate on ns - branes , and thus are finite in the @xmath8 direction , the situation changes . in that case",
    "the solution of equation ( [ dbi ] ) is no longer independent of @xmath8 , and one therefore has to solve a two dimensional laplace equation .        the solutions for the branes will not surprisingly look very different . for simplicity",
    ", we will solve the flat space laplace equation which is only an approximation to the true equation of motion . as a consistency check",
    ", one can plug the solution into the full equation of motion ( [ dbi ] ) and verify that far away from the source we get back the flat space laplace equation .",
    "generally , this means we trust our solution better far from the intersection .",
    "a relevant question to ask is what happens to supersymmetry when the d5-brane is finite and the ns - brane therefore bends in two dimensions as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "the answer can be found by examining the @xmath17-symmetry of the 5-brane @xcite .",
    "we find that supersymmetry is preserved when the following martix has zero eigenvalues @xmath18 here @xmath19 , the pullback of the space - time gamma matrices and @xmath20 contains the field strength of the world volume gauge field . when the 5-brane is flat @xmath20 is zero and we get the usual equation for a supersymmetric configuration .",
    "when the brane is curved we find that we have to turn on some non - trivial @xmath20 field to preserve supersymmetry in analogy with @xcite .",
    "we now consider explicitly the form of the solution in several relevant examples .",
    "* the first example we consider is the one describing pure n=1 sym theory .",
    "we will solve for the bending of the -brane . in our simplified discussion of the -brane bending the only role played by the ns - branes",
    "is to provide a point in the 6 - 7 plane on which the d5-branes can terminate . to find the bending of the -brane caused by one d5-brane of length @xmath21 ending on it ,",
    "we integrate the solution of the two - dimensional laplace equation for a point - like charge along the line @xmath22 , @xmath23 and find the solution : @xmath24 the first conclusion to be drawn from eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitebox ] ) is that there indeed exists a continuous and smooth solution , and thus this brane configuration is consistent .",
    "note that when viewed far from the intersection ( large @xmath6 ) , the solution exhibits _ logarithmic _ ( not linear ) bending .",
    "this is to be expected , since we no longer have an infinite line source of charge .",
    "when viewed from far away , the finite line of charge appears point - like ; one expects logarithmic bending .",
    "this is similar to the bending of the ns - branes in the type iia configuration @xcite . on the other hand , close to where the d5-brane is located",
    "the solution looks almost linear . to illustrate this point we plot a picture of a -brane being pulled by a d5-brane in figure [ fig : finitebox ] .",
    "+    * we next consider the solution for qcd with matter .",
    "we can add @xmath25 semi - infinite d5-branes on the left and on the right ( see figure [ fig : nlnrmodel ] ) .",
    "as was discussed in @xcite this corresponds to an @xmath5 gauge theory with @xmath26 flavors in the fundamental representation .",
    "it is convenient to find the solution for 3 finite boxes of length @xmath27 , @xmath21 , @xmath28 , and then take a limit @xmath29 .",
    "the bending of the -branes is given by @xmath30+\\cr         & ( n_c - n_f)(l - x_6 ) \\log ( ( l - x_6)^2+x_7 ^ 2)+ \\cr       & ( n_c - n_f)(l+x_6)\\log ( l+x_6)^2+x_7 ^ 2 ) ) + \\cr      & 2 \\pi n_f { \\left | x_7 \\right |},\\cr      \\end{array}\\ ] ] where we subtracted constant terms .",
    "at sufficiently large distances from the finite box , the bending is approximately given by the superposition of the linear and logarithmic terms .",
    "again , the solution we find is smooth .",
    "+   antiquarks and @xmath31 quarks , height=96 ] + in the case we are considering , the solution for the ns - brane bending is still logarithmic at large distances .",
    "it is identical to the solution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitebox ] ) with a factor of @xmath32 and an obvious relabelling of directions .",
    "when @xmath33 , we find that the ns - branes intersect .",
    "this is because the bending of one set of ns - brane does not carry the full information about the breaking of supersymmetry down to @xmath0 .",
    "thus the ns - brane intersection reflects the loss of asymptotic freedom in the `` parent '' @xmath34 theory .",
    "we conclude that in addition to sqcd with @xmath26 flavors the field theory of this brane configuration contains additional degrees of freedom which have not been identified .",
    "we therefore would not describe the @xmath33 theories in this manner but instead would construct configurations with @xmath33 by putting some of the d5-branes in different boxes @xcite . *",
    "the final configuration we consider is a case with no finite boxes , but two horizontal -branes and a single vertical ns - brane .",
    "one could similarly consider instead the example with more vertical ns - branes which can be interpreted as a gauge theory , but this simpler case is sufficient to illustrate our point .",
    "assume that the number of @xmath35 branes on the left ( right ) is @xmath36 .",
    "the solution contains infinite terms of the form @xmath37 .",
    "we can choose @xmath38 and @xmath39 in such a way that these terms cancel , and take the limit in a correlated fashion .",
    "the solution is then @xmath40 note that if either @xmath41 or @xmath31 were zero , we could not cancel the divergence . in that case",
    "the -brane would become vertical in the 4 - 6 plane .",
    "this problem suggests that it may be necessary for the d5-branes to end on d7-branes so that all d5-branes in the configuration are finite .",
    "these are presumably necessary if one is to describe correctly the moduli fields , analogously to d6-branes in the type iia theory @xcite .",
    "+   ] + in @xcite , it was argued that for @xmath42 , there would be a sharp transition as one moves along @xmath8 , which would literally tear the branes apart at large @xmath6 distances . as we can see from the solution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlnenr ] ) , the situation is quite different .",
    "we find that the transition region is smooth everywhere and in fact becomes more smooth as one goes to large @xmath6 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : angle ] where we have plotted the angle at which the brane bends ( @xmath43 ) as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath6 . as can be seen , there is a transition between two different bending angles but it is smooth everywhere and the branes do not break .    from these examples ,",
    "the general behavior of the solution should be clear .",
    "a general solution is a superposition of elementary solutions and in our approximation ns- and -branes bend independently . for instance , if we consider many finite boxes in a row ( corresponding to product group theories ) the solution is given by a linear superposition of many solutions from the first example ; again the general tendency should be clear .",
    "there is always a smooth solution to the two dimensional laplace equation which approximates the true answer .",
    "however , we have not yet considered restrictions which might be imposed when there is more than one ns- or -brane which is bending , so that there can be intersections which lead to new field theory degrees of freedom .",
    "we do this in the next section .",
    "in a model with anomalous matter content . , height=192 ]    in the previous section , we found that there exist smooth solutions for the - ( ns- ) brane shapes for arbitrary d - brane configurations .",
    "thus it appears that one can relax the conditions imposed in @xcite .",
    "can one impose any restrictions on allowed brane configurations by considering their bending ?",
    "we will require that all brane configurations are such that the ns- ( - ) branes do not intersect over a 4-dimensional manifold .",
    "if the branes would intersect , there would be additional light degrees of freedom living on the intersection and the content of the effective field theory would be different .",
    "let us illustrate the consequences of this requirement on an anomalous model with @xmath44 .",
    "combining the solution for pure sym theory in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finitebox ] ) with the solution for semi - infinite d5-branes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlnenr ] ) we plot the shape of one -brane at @xmath22 in figure [ fig : anomalous ] . since the other -brane bends in the opposite direction we find that two ( classically ) parallel -branes intersect over a 4-dimensional surface .",
    "thus the anomalous theory is problematic as a brane configuration .",
    "we therefore we impose the requirement @xmath45 .",
    "notice that this condition was imposed by hand from a knowledge of the field theory in @xcite but here we derive it from the brane configuration itself .",
    "for any theory constructed out of two ns - branes and two -branes the above condition becomes : @xmath46    it is easy to further generalize our conditions to an arbitrary array of brane boxes constructed out of h -branes and v ns - branes . requiring that branes do not intersect imposes @xmath47 independent conditions on @xmath48 numbers of d5-branes , which is far less than the @xmath49 conditions imposed in @xcite .",
    "yet we note that these conditions exclude some of the interesting models , including the @xmath50 model of dynamical supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it is , however , not quite clear to us whether even these less restrictive conditions imposed above are necessary .",
    "for example , instead of introducing matter by having semi - infinite d5-branes one could allow them to end on d7-branes as noted earlier . then moving the d7-branes sufficiently close to the gauge theory box , one could guarantee that there are no 4-dimensional intersections of ns- ( - ) branes .",
    "if this were possible , then the physics would depend on the @xmath8 position of the d7-branes and the @xmath7 position of the d7@xmath51 branes .",
    "this is in contrast to the role played by the d6-branes in type iia configurations , where holomorphic quantities do not depend on the @xmath8 coordinate of the d6-branes .",
    "this might be a reasonable difference , since it is difficult to identify the holomorphic structure of the field theory in the brane box configuration .",
    "we should mention however that the d7-branes change the geometry of space , introducing a deficit angle , so our flat space arguments may not be valid in their presence .",
    "while we lack a complete understanding of the conditions which should be imposed on brane configurations due to bending , we nonetheless can go on and consider implications of the above conditions together with anomaly freedom conditions imposed _",
    "by hand_. the total number of conditions would then be @xmath49 which is the same as the number of conditions in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the combination of our constraints and anomaly cancellation is always satisfied by the conditions of @xcite .",
    "however , in certain cases some of the anomaly freedom conditions are redundant , allowing theories with non - intersecting branes which do not satisfy conditions @xcite .",
    "we have seen an example of this in supersymmetric qcd . in figure",
    "[ fig : notgg ] , we give another example of an anomaly free , consistent brane configuration which does not satisfy the condition @xcite .    ) .",
    ", height=192 ]    finally , there is an additional subtlety .",
    "suppose we had started with a configuration in which the @xmath52th and @xmath53th ns ( or ) branes remain parallel ( even if they bend ) , so that the distance between them does not depend on the coordinate in the 4 - 5 ( 6 - 7 ) plane .",
    "then we can add @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 d5-branes to the corresponding ( finite ) boxes . as a result , the distance between the ns- ( - ) branes will change logarithmically at large values of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) . if @xmath59 , the two ns- ( - ) branes under consideration will intersect .",
    "we therefore exclude such configurations .",
    "our discussion of brane bending is also useful for understanding the relation of the running coupling constant to the brane configuration . due to dimensional reduction ,",
    "the 4-dimensional coupling constant is related to the area of the d5-brane bounded by the ns - branes .",
    "usually , the running of the coupling constant is associated with the bending of the ns - branes . however , since the intersection between the d5-brane and the ns- ( - ) brane is 4-dimensional , naively one would expect that the bending is linear , which would not reflect the running of the coupling constant in 4 dimensions .    as we have seen , in a pure sym configuration and at sufficiently large distances from the finite d5-branes , the solution ( and therefore , the distance between two ns - branes ) changes logarithmically : @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "it is tempting to identify this logarithmic bending with the properties of a 4-dimensional theory in analogy with @xcite .",
    "however , the coefficient of the log does not reproduce the beta function coefficient correctly .",
    "in fact the coefficient gives the correct value for @xmath34 sym .",
    "this is not surprising because our configuration has originated as an @xmath34 theory , and has been reduced to @xmath0 due to the presence of ns - branes .",
    "this is similar to the situation in the type iia constructions @xcite of @xmath0 sym .",
    "these models were constructed by rotating one of the ns - branes in the @xmath34 theory .",
    "the bending of each of the ns - branes is determined only by the number of d4-branes attached to it , and reflects the @xmath34 running coupling constant @xcite .",
    "one infers the beta function coefficient and the running of the coupling constant of the @xmath0 theory by taking into account the mass of the adjoint chiral multiplet which is not reflected in the bending of the branes . similarly in our case , the running coupling constant should be given by some function of the distances between both ns and -branes .",
    "gauge group with @xmath62 flavors in which the ns - branes do not bend . , height=192 ]    nevertheless , there do exist configurations with a simple relation between brane bending and the running gauge coupling . as has been argued in @xcite ,",
    "this is the case in the configurations where one set of ns - branes does not bend . in @xcite the one - loop coefficient @xmath63 of the beta function for such models ( see figure [ fig : bzero ] )",
    "was determined .",
    "the model in figure [ fig : bzero ] corresponds to an @xmath64 gauge theory with @xmath65 flavors .",
    "let us give an argument for the running coupling constant which is somewhat different from that in @xcite .",
    "the gauge coupling in the model is given by @xmath66 .",
    "the distance between the -branes depends linearly on @xmath6 : @xmath67    let us reconnect @xmath68 d5-branes in the middle row to form an infinite d5-brane and move them away in @xmath6 , thus higgsing the theory to @xmath69 colors and @xmath70 flavors .",
    "if we require that the asymptotic positions of the ns- and - branes do not change ( this would require an infinite amount of energy from a 4-dimensional point of view ) , then the area bounded by the ns- and -branes ( and , therefore the gauge coupling ) will change : @xmath71 where @xmath6 is the final position of the d5-branes .",
    "the coefficient in front of @xmath6 correctly reproduces the _ change _ in the one - loop beta - function coefficient @xmath63 .",
    "we could give analogous arguments for turning on mass terms by reconnecting an arbitrary number of d5-branes in the lower and/or bottom rows .",
    "thus it is tempting to identify the coefficient in front of @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : distance ] ) with @xmath63 .",
    "however , this would imply linear running of the gauge coupling , which seems to reflect that the origin of the theory is a five - dimensional theory .",
    "in fact , we can higgs the theory to take the d - branes off the ns - branes so that the theory really seems to be five - dimensional some of the semi - infinite d5-branes can not be reconnected into infinite ones , and the theory can never look truly five - dimensional .",
    "this is in an agreement with the fact that one does not expect inconsistencies in a five - dimensional configuration . ] .",
    "as we have noted before , even some potentially problematic configurations may be acceptable ( as far as the bending goes ) if all the d5-branes are finite ( which requires that flavor d5-branes end on d7 or d7@xmath51 branes ) . in the configuration of figure [ fig : bzero ] , we therefore introduce d7-branes .",
    "then asymptotically , the distance between the -branes changes _ logarithmically _ with the coefficient appropriate for @xmath0 theory : @xmath72 the arguments we have given above for matching couplings of the high energy and low energy theories are still valid , and thus we see the correct logarithmic running of the coupling constant .",
    "while we can not extract the running coupling constant from brane bending in an arbitrary configuration , it is possible to constrain the form of the beta function ( or more precisely , the one - loop coefficient of the beta function @xmath63 ) in the brane - box theories .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "assume that the beta function is an arbitrary function of @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and that it can be related to the bending of the branes .",
    "a precise knowledge of this relation is not necessary for the argument . from the assumption",
    "we conclude that any deformation of the brane configuration that does not change the bending of the branes can not change the beta function .",
    "in particular we can add one d5-brane that covers all the boxes .",
    "doing so we see that @xmath76 and that @xmath77 .",
    "the requirement that the beta function is invariant under this tells us that it is a function of the particular combination @xmath78 which is indeed correct for @xmath5 gauge theories with @xmath26 chiral multiplets in the fundamental representation .",
    "note that the same type of argument could be applied to the type iia configurations studied in @xcite .",
    "there one realizes @xmath34 supersymmetric gauge theories on the world volume of d4-branes suspended between ns - branes .",
    "if one adds a d4-brane that extends from minus infinity to plus infinity in @xmath79 , one does not change the bending of the ns - branes but one does indeed change the number of colors by one and the number of flavors by two giving the invariant combination @xmath80 which agrees with the @xmath34 beta function .",
    "so far , using the assumption that the brane bending encodes the beta function , we have established that ( the one loop coefficient of ) the beta function is an arbitrary function of @xmath81 : @xmath82 .",
    "assuming that this function is universal , we can determine its exact form by explicitly calculating its value in some simple cases . in section",
    "[ sec : run ] we were able to directly relate the change in brane bending of the configuration given in figure [ fig : bzero ] to the change of the value of @xmath63 .",
    "this tells us that @xmath83 where @xmath84 is an undetermined constant . finally we note that configurations without brane bending corresponds to field theories where @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "such configurations have @xmath86 and thus we find that @xmath87 .    in the presence of orientifolds , the identification of the degrees of freedom is less well understood .",
    "however , we believe that the argument given above should still apply in this case . the argument could in fact be used as a consistency check on any proposed counting of degrees of freedom in the presence of an orientifold plane .",
    "in this paper , using the fact that the bending of ns - branes in brane - box theories is determined by a two dimensional laplace equation , we have demonstrated the existence of consistent solutions .",
    "a d5-brane ending on the ns - brane looks like a line of charge and a line of charge of finite extent looks like a point charge at long distance and thus gives rise to logarithmic bending rather than linear bending .",
    "this means that we can relax some of the consistency conditions on these theories proposed in @xcite since they were derived assuming that all branes bend linearly . at long distance",
    "the brane bends as a smooth solution of the two dimensional laplace equation and the branes do not break .",
    "what can happen though is that two of the ns - branes intersect at some distance . in that case",
    "there can be new massless states that has not been taken into account in the field theory and it does not capture the physics on the branes correctly .    the requirement that branes do not intersect is much less restrictive than the condition given in @xcite . in particular , we find configurations of branes that do not intersect but that give rise to field theories that are anomalous .",
    "this shows that there is no direct relation between field theory anomalies and the brane bending . presumably to understand the anomalies better one would have to look at non - conservation of ramond - ramond charge in the brane set - up",
    "we also argued that if all `` flavor '' d5-branes are finite ending on d7 and/or d7@xmath51 branes , and if the d7- ( d7@xmath51- ) branes are sufficiently close , there may be even less restrictions .",
    "we have also seen that in some cases , the d7-branes may be required in order to have a truly 4-dimensional theory .",
    "however , we have observed a mysterious dependence on the @xmath8 ( @xmath7 ) coordinate of the d7- ( d7@xmath51- ) branes .",
    "also , the d7-branes introduce a deficit angle into the geometry and there might be restrictions on the allowed number of d7-branes .",
    "the physics associated with the introduction of d7-branes into the system requires further investigation .",
    "we also showed that in some simple configurations and in the presence of d7 branes , the logarithmic running of the gauge couplings can be simply read off from the brane bending .",
    "although it is not manifest how this relation works in general , we have demonstrated that the bending of the branes does correctly reflect the beta function dependence on @xmath4 and @xmath26 .",
    "we commented that this should also be true for theories with orientifolds .",
    "the argument makes it clear that the bending of the branes does encode the beta function and provides a nice consistency check on the brane - box theories since it relies only on the way flavors are counted in these theories .",
    "it would be interesting to identify more precisely how the branes encode this information about the beta function .",
    "also of importance ultimately is to see how the branes incorporate quantum effects .",
    "since these are presumably most important in the vicinity of the intersection of d5 and ns- or -branes , one might require a more exact solution to the equations of motion in order to explore non - perturbative gauge dynamics with brane - box theories .",
