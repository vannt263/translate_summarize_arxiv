    "besides its primary concern to many industrial applications , the rotor - stator problem has proved a fruitful means of studying turbulence in confined rotating flows .",
    "this specific configuration is indeed among the simplest ones where rotation brings significant modifications to the turbulent field .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of the turbulent flow in an enclosed high - speed rotor - stator system of large aspect ratio .",
    "the flow is of batchelor type and belongs to the regime denoted iv by daily and nece @xcite .",
    "these authors provided an estimated value for the local reynolds number at which turbulence originates with separated boundary layers , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 the radial location ) for @xmath10 .",
    "however , experiments have revealed that transition to turbulence can appear at a lower value of the reynolds number within the stator boundary layer ( the bdewadt layer ) , even though the flow remains laminar in the rotor boundary layer ( the ekman layer ) .",
    "recently , the 3d computed solution presented here has been compared to velocity measurements performed at irphe @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , for the rotational reynolds number @xmath11 , the bdewadt layer is turbulent and the rotor one is still laminar .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide detailed data of the turbulent boundary layer along the stator side in a large enclosed system ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the numerical approach is based on a pseudo - spectral technique using chebyshev polynomials in the radial and axial directions with fourier series in the azimuthal direction associated with a semi - implicit second order time scheme .",
    "an efficient projection method is introduced to solve the pressure - velocity coupling .",
    "a grid resolution composed of @xmath13 respectively in radial , axial and azimuthal directions has been used , with a dimensionless time step @xmath14 .",
    "numerical computations have been carried out on nec sx-5 ( idris , orsay , france ) .",
    "the detailed description of the mean field and of the axial variations of the reynolds stress tensor is given in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we recall the main results .",
    "a good agreement has been obtained between the 3d solution and the experimental data , whereas the axisymetric solution leads to a steady laminar flow .",
    "the flow is of batchelor type : the two boundary layers developed on each disk are separated by a central rotating core characterized by a quasi zero radial velocity and a constant tangential velocity .",
    "the bdewadt layer along the stator is centripetal , three - dimensional as the townsend structural parameter is lower than the limit value @xmath15 , and turbulent with turbulence intensities increasing from the axis to the periphery of the cavity . on the contrary , the ekman layer on the rotor is centrifugal and laminar .",
    "the turbulence is observed by the formation of turbulent spots developing along spiral arms towards the periphery of the cavity , as seen in figure [ fg1 ] from the instantaneous iso - values of the turbulence kinetic energy within the stator boundary layer .",
    "the balance equation for the turbulence kinetic energy @xmath16 can be written : @xmath17    with the advection term @xmath18 , the production term @xmath19 , the turbulent diffusion @xmath20 , the viscous diffusion @xmath21 , the velocity - pressure - gradient correlation @xmath22 and the dissipation term @xmath23 .     at : ( a ) @xmath24 , ( b ) @xmath25.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] +",
    "( a ) +   at : ( a ) @xmath24 , ( b ) @xmath25.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] + ( b )    figures [ bilankz]a and [ bilankz]b show the axial variations along @xmath26 of the different terms involved in the transport equation ( [ tkeb ] ) at two radial locations .",
    "it is clearly seen that all these terms vanish towards the rotor side ( @xmath27 ) , confirming the laminar nature of this zone up to the stator boundary layer ( @xmath28 ) . at the stator wall , the viscous diffusion balances the dissipation as well known in 3d turbulent boundary layer . within the bdewadt layer , even though some interaction between the different terms involved is observed , the major contributions come from the production , the dissipation and the viscous diffusion terms .",
    "the production is balanced by the dissipation and the viscous diffusion , the level of which increases in association with the thickening of the boundary layer towards the periphery",
    ". the production increases with increasing radius as already observed with the levels of the normal reynolds stresses @xcite .",
    "the maximum of the production term is obtained at the wall coordinate @xmath29 ( @xmath30 the total friction velocity and @xmath31 the axial coordinate ) for @xmath24 and at @xmath32 for @xmath25 , which confirms the approximately self - similar behavior of the bdewadt layer .",
    "the levels of the viscous diffusion increase when moving towards the outer casing , where the highest turbulence intensities prevail .",
    "it indicates that viscous effects still play an important role in the turbulence towards these regions , which does not allow for a distinct delineation of the viscous sublayer .",
    "this indicates also the weak nature of the turbulence obtained at this reynolds number .       of the conditionally averaged reynolds shear stress at @xmath33 in the vicinity of ( a ) a strong ejection @xmath34 @xmath35 and ( b ) a strong sweep @xmath34 @xmath36.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] + ( a )     of the conditionally averaged reynolds shear stress at @xmath33 in the vicinity of ( a ) a strong ejection @xmath34 @xmath35 and ( b ) a strong sweep @xmath34 @xmath36.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] + ( b )    to gain a better insight on the near - wall structure of the turbulent boundary layer along the stator side , a conditional - averaged quadrant analysis is performed to identify the contributions of intense intermittent bursting events ( ejections and sweeps ) on the reynolds shear stress producing vortical structures",
    ". it corresponds to four subdivisions of the fluctuation field according to the combination of the tangential @xmath37 and axial @xmath38 velocity fluctuations @xcite . following the definitions given in @xcite in a fixed frame ,",
    "a strong sweep is associated with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( quadrant q4 ) and a strong ejection with @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( quadrant q2 ) . in the first quadrant q1 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 , while in the third quadrant q3 , @xmath44 and @xmath40 .",
    "the quadrant analysis is applied at @xmath33 corresponding to the location of the maximum value of the turbulent shear stress .",
    "we have also considered the value @xmath45 to determine strong events , as used in @xcite .",
    "we display in figures [ vwsweep]a and [ vwsweep]b the variations with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 the wall coordinate in the radial direction ) of the conditionally averaged reynolds shear stress normalized by the unconditionally ensemble averaged reynolds shear stress @xmath48 near a strong ejection ( fig.[vwsweep]a ) and a strong sweep ( fig.[vwsweep]b ) .",
    "the contributions of each quadrant are also presented .",
    "the figures [ vwsweep]a and [ vwsweep]b clearly show that the ejection ( q2 ) and sweep ( q4 ) quadrants contribute much more to the reynolds shear stress production than the two other quadrants .",
    "on the other hand , it seems that the weakness of the turbulence in the present simulation accentuates the features observed in previous works .",
    "the results obtained support the conclusions of littell and eaton @xcite and lygren and andersson @xcite , in contrast with the findings of kang et @xmath49 @xcite : the asymmetries observed are dominated by reynolds stress - producing coherent structures ( sweep and ejection ) . lygren and andersson @xcite concluded that clockwise vortices contribute much more to the reynolds shear stress than counter - clockwise vortices .",
    "the same behavior applies in the presence of a sweep event . in this case , the levels of the surrounding ejections approach the strong sweep level and are even slightly beyond the fixed criterion condition @xmath45 , as seen in figure [ vwsweep]b , while the levels of sweeps around a strong ejection are less important ( fig.[vwsweep]a ) , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "case 1 vortices , having induced near - wall velocity in the direction of the crossflow , are found to be the major source of generation of special strong events .",
    "dns calculations have been used to describe the turbulent boundary layer along the stator side in a large enclosed rotor - stator cavity . for the rotational reynolds number under consideration @xmath50 ,",
    "the bdewadt layer is 3d turbulent , whereas the ekman layer on the rotor is still laminar .",
    "the transition to turbulence is associated with the onset of localized turbulent spots spiraling up along the stator side .",
    "the turbulence kinetic energy budgets have revealed that production is the major contribution with a maximum obtained at @xmath51 independently of the radial location , confirming the self - similar behavior of the bdewadt layer .",
    "the results of the quadrant analysis support the conclusions proposed by @xcite .",
    "the asymmetries observed by these authors have been clearly detected and the analysis of conditionally averaged streamwise and wall - normal velocity components confirms that these asymmetries mainly arise from the contributions of quadrants q2 and q4 , responsible for the generation of ejection and sweep events . therefore , case 1 vortices are found to be the major source of generation of special strong events .",
