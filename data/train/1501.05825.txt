    "a stellar atmospheric model describes the temperature and density stratification of the atmosphere , i.e. the variation of temperature and pressure with height in the atmosphere .",
    "in addition to the vertical stratification there may be horizontal temperature and density inhomogeneities due to , e.g. , rotation , magnetic fields , or convection .",
    "together with opacities , these stellar model atmospheres predict the spectrum emerging from every point of a stellar disk .",
    "most often model atmospheres are calibrated by and compared to integrated stellar spectra . however , spatially resolved observations can measure the intensity profile across the stellar disk and can thus provide stronger constraints on model atmospheres .",
    "such observations have been successfully executed by direct imaging observations of the sun , and by interferometric observations for the case of stars other than the sun .",
    "cool evolved stars finish their evolution that is driven by nuclear fusion along the hayashi track in the hertzsprung russel ( hr ) diagram .",
    "they are characterized by low effective temperatures between about 2500k and 4000k and low surface gravities .",
    "they show extended atmospheres that have conditions favorable for the formation of molecules and dust .",
    "dust is accelerated dragging along the gas , a process that leads to circumstellar shells and the expulsion of gas and dust into the interstellar medium via winds . from here on , the further stellar evolution of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( initial masses up to about 8 solar masses ) toward planetary nebulae ( pne ) and of red supergiants ( rsgs , initial masses above about 8 solar masses ) toward core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) is mostly driven by the mass - loss process .",
    "the details of this process are currently best constrained for carbon - rich agb stars , i.e. stars for which carbon has been dredged up from the core into the atmosphere , as outlined by , e.g. , wachter  ( @xcite ) and mattsson  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the process is less constrained for oxygen - rich agb stars ( e.g. , woitke @xcite , hfner @xcite ) and for red supergiants ( e.g. , josselin & plez @xcite ) . in order to constrain and to understand these processes ,",
    "it is important to observationally establish the detailed stratification and geometry of the extended atmosphere and the dust formation region , and to compare it to different modeling attempts .",
    "here , interferometry plays a crucial role by its ability to spatially resolve the atmospheres and innermost regions of the dust formation zone , where the mass - loss process is initiated .",
    "a few selected examples of interferometric observations of stellar atmospheres and circumstellar environments include constraints of the limb - darkening effect ( e.g. , quirrenbach  @xcite , wittkowski  @xcite ) , comparisons with models of photospheric convection ( e.g. , chiavassa  @xcite ) , interferometric observations of oblate shapes of rotating stars ( e.g. , domiciano de souza @xcite ) , constraints of stellar pulsations of cepheids ( e.g. , kervella  @xcite ) and mira variables ( e.g. , thompson  @xcite ) , dust formation around cepheids ( e.g. , kervella  @xcite ) and miras ( e.g. , wittkowski  @xcite ) , observations of disks in binary post - agb stars ( e.g. , deroo  @xcite ) , or investigations of the central regions of pne ( e.g. , chesneau @xcite ) .    in the following section we describe in more detail interferometric observations of stellar atmospheres on the ( first ) red giant branch ( rgb ) , the agb , and of rsgs .",
    "we continue with dust shells and winds from these cool evolved stars , and finally describe recent observational results on asymmetries of their circumstellar dust environments . in the context of the vlti school book , we focus on results obtained with the vlti , but also include examples of important results from other interferometers",
    ". evolutionary stages preceding and succeeding rgb , agb , and rsg stars are not ( fully ) covered by this article , as for instance hotter giants and supergiants , post - agb stars , pne , or wolf - rayet stars .",
    "interferometric observations of stars provide to first order stellar radii and such measurements have been the prime scientific target of early interferometers .",
    "the next - order effect of resolving a stellar surface is a measurement of the limb - darkening effect , where stars appear brighter at the center of the stellar disk and darker at the limb of the stellar disk .",
    "this phenomenon is a consequence of the vertical temperature stratification of the stellar atmosphere combined with the line - of - sight of the observation . along any line of sight",
    "the observer will see into a geometrical depth of the atmosphere that corresponds to an optical depth of unity . toward the center of the star , deeper atmospheric layers are seen , which are hotter because of the vertical temperature stratification ; toward the limb of the star shallower atmospheric layers are seen , which are cooler .",
    "observations of this effect thus constrain the vertical temperature stratification of the atmosphere , which is one of the prime outcomes of a model atmosphere .",
    "the strength of the effect depends on the temperature stratification of the star and on the wavelength of observation .",
    "model atmospheres are based on different model geometries , plane - parallel geometries and spherical geometries .",
    "the plane - parallel model is semi - infinite for all viewing angles , i.e. all paths are optically thick .",
    "it has a singularity at a viewing angle of 90 deg . , where the intensity drops suddenly to zero .",
    "the spherical model has an optically thin limb .",
    "this causes an inflection point of the intensity profile and a tail - like extension .",
    "more details on the effects of model geometries can be found in sect .",
    "3.4 of wittkowski  ( @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , effects of the true spherical nature of stars are more pronounced for stars that have very extended atmospheres , as in the case of cool evolved stars discussed here .",
    "it has been observationally established that the photospheres of agb stars and red supergiants are surrounded by atmospheric molecular layers ( e.g. , mennesson  @xcite , perrin  @xcite ) . in these cases",
    "the model geometry is more complex than a simple plane - parallel or spherical geometry . instead , the intensity profiles are strongly wavelength dependent and show multiple components or strong tail - like extensions ( cf .",
    "scholz @xcite ) .",
    "the definition of a stellar radius is not easy because of the complex geometries of the stellar atmospheres , as described above , and the complex resulting intensity profiles , cf .",
    "scholz ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is in particular true for cool evolved stars , which show extended atmospheres and extended molecular layers .",
    "different definitions have stellar diameters have been used in the literature in the context of interferometric observations :    * _ uniform disk radius : _ a uniform disk ( ud ) diameter is obtained from a fit of a uniform disk model to the measured visibility data , i.e. determining to first order the radius of a uniform disk that has the same integral flux as the true intensity profile . since the true intensity profile is not a uniform disk but limb - darkened or even more complex ( see above ) and depends on the wavelength , this uniform disk will be wavelength - dependent and does not correspond to a certain physical layer of the star .",
    "however , it can be corrected to a limb - darkened or rosseland - mean ( see below ) radius using model atmospheres . * _ 0% intensity radius : _ the 0% intensity radius corresponds to the radius where the intensity drops to zero .",
    "this is the radius that is obtained by fitting a model atmosphere to interferometric data . however , for a spherical geometry , the intensity never drops to zero but is set to zero at an arbitrary outer boundary condition .",
    "it can be corrected to a rosseland - mean ( see below ) radius using model atmospheres . * _ 50% radius or fwhm : _ a 50% radius or a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) diameter corresponds to the radius at which the intensity drops to 50% of its maximum value .",
    "this radius is better defined than a ud radius or a 0% intensity radius in the case of very extended intensity profiles .",
    "it depends on the bandpass in the same way as the ud diameter . * _ rosseland radius : _ the rosseland radius corresponds to the atmospheric layer where the rosseland - mean optical depth equals 2/3 .",
    "this definition is physically most meaningful , as it is independent of wavelength and corresponds to the radius as used in defining physical quantities such as the luminosity or the effective temperature .",
    "however , it is not a direct observable but has to be derived from observations based on model atmospheres .",
    "it may also be contaminated by extended molecular and dusty layers that are located above the photosphere but contribute to the rosseland - mean opacity .",
    "it may observationally best be determined by comparisons of observations in near - continuum bandpasses together with model atmosphere predictions .",
    "a physically meaningful determination of a stellar radius is also important to derive fundamental stellar parameters , most importantly effective temperature and luminosity .",
    "several teams used the vlti to concentrate on accurate measurements of stellar radii and fundamental parameters of cool evolved stars , including richichi & roccatagliata ( @xcite ) , wittkowski  ( @xcite ) , cusano  ( @xcite ) , cruzalbes  ( @xcite ) , arroyo - torres  ( @xcite ) , paumard  ( @xcite ) .",

    "direct observations of the limb - darkening effect require a higher spatial resolution that fully resolves the stellar disk , i.e. requires visibility measurements within the second lobe . these are more difficult to obtain because they require longer baselines and -more importantly- they require observations of low visibilities corresponding to vanishing fringe contrasts .",
    "early observations of the limb - darkening effect of red giants were obtained by quirrenbach  ( @xcite ) with the mark iii interferometer , hajian  ( @xcite ) and wittkowski  ( @xcite ) with the npoi interferometer , and by wittkowski  ( @xcite ) with the vlti .",
    "there are in principle two ways to probe the limb - darkening effect :    * interferometric observations in the 2nd lobe of the visibility function at one bandpass .",
    "this method directly probes the shape of the intensity profile . *",
    "measuring the variation of a ( ud ) diameter versus wavelength .",
    "this method probes the wavelength - dependent strength of the limb - darkening effect .",
    "model atmospheres are best constrained using a combination of both methods , i.e. by observations in the 2nd lobe of the visibility function at several bandpasses .",
    "[ fig : menkar ] shows as an example a measurement of the limb - darkening effect of the m giant menkar ( @xmath0  ceti ) obtained with the vinci instrument of the vlti by wittkowski  ( @xcite ) .",
    "it shows that the uniform disk model and the model atmosphere prediction are virtually identical within the first lobe of the visibility function and differ only in the second lobe .",
    "the maximum of the visibility within the second lobe is then a measure of the strength of the limb - darkening effect .",
    "comparisons of different models and different bandpasses show a trend that the limb - darkening effect is stronger at shorter ( visual ) wavelengths and weaker ( i.e. closer to the ud prediction ) at longer ( infrared ) wavelengths and that it is stronger for cooler stars , which have more extended atmospheres , than for hotter stars .",
    "finally , it should be noted that 3-dimensional ( 3-d ) model atmospheres including effects of photospheric convection predict a slightly different strength of the limb - darkening effect compared to 1-dimensional ( 1-d ) models of the same stellar parameters .",
    "hotter , rising granules have a warmer temperature structure than cooler , descending dark lanes .",
    "the mean temperature structure of a 3-d model then differs from that of a 1-d model ( e.g. hayek  @xcite ) .",
    "this effect has been observed interferometrically by aufdenberg  ( @xcite ) for procyon .",
    "high - precision interferometric observations in continuum bandpasses may thus in future provide further constraints on stellar convection and 3-d model atmospheres .",
    "agb stars are affected by stellar pulsations starting with irregular pulsation in mostly overtone modes on the low - luminosity agb to regular pulsation in fundamental mode of mira variables ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , wood @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsation in the stellar interior leads to atmospheric motion .",
    "shock fronts reach the atmosphere , levitate the gas , and lead to a very extended atmospheric structure and to conditions that are favorable for the formation of molecules .",
    "this leads to a scenario where molecular layers lie above the continuum - forming photosphere .",
    "the resulting intensity profiles are very complex and wavelength - dependent showing features such as multiple components , step - like functions corresponding to the locations of the shock fronts , or tail - like extensions .",

    "this was confirmed with non zero closure phase observations with isi by chandler  ( @xcite ) . even in this well studied case",
    ", it is not clear if the clumps follow a random direction or a preferential one ( like disc or spiral ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the small @xmath11-coverage of the observations .",
    "two j - type stars were observed by vlti / midi , and showed a clear signature of departure from symmetry in the differential phase ( deroo  @xcite ; ohnaka  @xcite ) .",
    "a general consensus about these objects is that they are binaries with an unseen companion , probably a main sequence star ( morris @xcite ; lloyd evans @xcite , and yamamura  @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were interpreted as circum - binary or circum - companion discs , in which the oxygen - material has been stored while the agb star transformed from an oxygen - rich star to a carbon - rich star ( cf . also ohnaka @xcite ) . as an illustration ,",
    "[ fig : ohnaka ] shows the best - fit asymmetric ring model of the silicate carbon star bm gem at a wavelength of 10@xmath4 m from ohnaka  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this ring model can be characterized by a broad ring with a bright region offset from the unresolved star , and can be interpreted as a system with a circum - companion disk .",
    "we note that the shape of the differential phase for the two stars by deroo  and ohnaka  is very different",
    ". this might be the effect of the different chemistry , mixed with the effect of different geometries .",
    "a similar signature was detected for the two mira variables r  for and rt  vir ( paladini  @xcite ; sacuto  @xcite ) .",
    "the asymmetry could be interpreted as a clump , without involving a disc structure .",
    "the authors were able to reproduce the visibility and differential phase with a simple model composed by a ud representing the central star , a gaussian for the extended envelope , and a dirac function representing a bright dust clump .",
    "the shape of the differential phase of r  for was matching the one observed by deroo  ( @xcite ) .",
    "an asymmetry was also found in the dusty region of the o - rich star with a peculiar co profile sv psc by klotz  ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the asymmetry is again interpreted as the presence of a disc or of a companion .",
    "again the poor @xmath11-coverage makes data interpretation complex and at this stage it is not possible to conclude if disks are present at this spatial scale , and if they are associated with hidden unknown binary companions , or with the mass loss mechanism .",
    "interestingly , the number of asymmetries detected in agb stars with optical interferometry is rather small compared to the number of papers published .",
    "ohnaka  ( @xcite ) , wittkowski  ( @xcite ) , sacuto  ( @xcite ) , zhao - geisler   ( @xcite,@xcite ) , karovicova  ( @xcite ) , klotz  ( @xcite ) did not detect any asymmetries of the circumstellar dust shells .",
    "this might imply that the asymmetric structures detected with midi are not very common among the agbs .",
    "alternatively , they might appear only at low visibility values ( below 0.1 ) , while most of the observations presented so far did not sample this part of the visibility curve ."
