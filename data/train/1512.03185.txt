    "magnetic recording heads generate intense local magnetic field pulses to write bits of information onto a magnetic medium .",
    "bits are encoded in the magnetization direction of magnetic domains separated by less than @xmath5 in state - of - the - art devices .",
    "write fields thus must be confined to a very narrow region in space , leading to extremely high local gradients . although these gradients can not be precisely measured , they are estimated to exceed @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this is far beyond the capability of static magnetic tips ( @xmath7 @xcite ) and that of nanoscale coils or microstrips ( @xmath8 @xcite ) , and likely close to the highest experimentally achievable gradient for this kind of field source .",
    "in addition , write poles are rapidly switchable , potentially allowing for dynamical control of magnetic fields up to @xmath9 @xcite at low power consumption . with these features ,",
    "the hard drive industry has created a tool that could enable important advances in many areas of nanoscale experimental physics .",
    "a significant challenge in characterizing and exploiting writer fields is their nanometer spatial confinement . in this study",
    ", we introduce a new variant of force microscopy  magnetic susceptibility force microscopy ( @xmath10fm )  to localize and measure the write pole field quantitatively and with high spatial resolution .",
    "the technique relies on the small diamagnetic moment induced in a nominally non - magnetic diamond tip @xcite that is positioned over the pole .",
    "we show that by using a state - of - the - art nanomechanical force transducer @xcite , tip magnetic moments far below one bohr magneton can be detected , thus greatly advancing the sensitivity of mechanical spin detection @xcite . moreover , because of the diamond tip s well - defined material composition and extremely sharp end radius ( @xmath11 ) , quantitative and high - resolution field maps of the pole can be reconstructed .",
    "our method thus provides advantages over magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) @xcite and electron holography @xcite , which are difficult to quantify , barely reach sufficient resolution , or provide two - dimensional projections .",
    "the experimental geometry and the basic protocol for magnetic susceptibility force measurements are presented in figures [ fig : fig_1 ] and [ fig : fig_2 ] , respectively .",
    "the magnetic force is generated by passing an alternating current @xmath12 through the write head s drive coil .",
    "the current dynamically magnetizes the write pole and a stray field @xmath13 appears above the pole .",
    "a tip placed in the stray field acquires a small magnetization @xmath14 owing to its magnetic susceptibility @xmath10 ( @xmath15na@xmath16 is the permeability of free space and typically @xmath17 ) .",
    "a weak force develops that attracts or repels the tip from the region of strongest field , depending on whether the tip is paramagnetic ( @xmath18 ) or diamagnetic ( @xmath19 ) . for a point - like particle located at position @xmath20",
    "the force is @xmath21 = \\frac{\\chi v}{\\mu_0 } \\nabla |{\\bm{{\\mathrm{b}}}}({\\bm{{\\mathrm{r}}}})|^2 \\ ,",
    "\\label{eq : force}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the magnetic moment and @xmath23 the volume of the particle . for a transducer responsive to forces along the @xmath24-direction , the measured force signal is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the magnetic gradient in @xmath24-direction .",
    "since both the susceptibility @xmath10 and the volume @xmath27 are small , the expected magnetic moment is minute , on the order of one bohr magneton for a field of a few hundred mt . even in a high gradient @xmath28 the diamagnetic force will therefore be less than @xmath29 . to distinguish this force signal from background fluctuations and spurious electrostatic driving , we modulate the drive current at half the cantilever resonance ( @xmath30 ) while measuring the force generated at @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2 ] ) . for small driving currents @xmath12 ,",
    "the write pole is not saturated and the field and gradient are both proportional to @xmath12 . for a sinusoidal modulation @xmath32 with amplitude @xmath33",

    "the force then drives mechanical oscillations @xmath36 of the cantilever that are detected by optical interferometry ( see methods ) .",
    "note that as the current is increased , the write pole eventually becomes saturated resulting in a square - wave response to a sinusoidal drive .",
    "this leads to the appearance of higher order terms in the fourier series .      in a first experiment",
    ", we demonstrate that magnetic susceptibility forces can indeed be measured . for this purpose , we positioned the diamond tip at @xmath37 over the pole surface and measured the cantilever signal as a function of drive current amplitude @xmath12 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_3]a . as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : force ] ) , the cantilever signal increased quadratically when increasing the driving current from zero to a few ma . to confirm that the observed signal is truly due to magnetic driving by the write pole , we have also varied the shape of the current modulation . when using a rectangular drive ,",
    "no signal was observed , consistent with the absence of a fourier component for this modulation pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_3]b ) . as the pattern was continuously changed from rectangular to triangular ,",
    "the cantilever signal first increased , reached a maximum at trapezoidal drive , and then decreased again ( see figure insets ) .    to record a two - dimensional image",
    ", we performed a raster scan over the pole and plotted the cantilever oscillation amplitude as a function of @xmath38 tip position ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_4]a ) .",
    "the scan clearly shows two regions of high signal , which we identify as the front and back end of the write pole .",
    "as expected , the largest force is generated near the trailing gap where the bending of field lines is highest .",
    "a finite element simulation of the expected force signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_4]b ) , based exclusively on the micrograph of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1]d , agrees surprisingly well with the scanning experiment ( see supplementary figure 1 for details ) .",
    "the signal peaks are localized to within @xmath4 , demonstrating the high spatial resolution of the magnetic susceptibility force imaging technique .    by measuring the phase shift between the cantilever oscillation and the drive current",
    ", information about the sign of @xmath10 can be extracted in addition to the magnitude of the magnetic force .",
    "[ fig : fig_4]c , d show two dimensional force images obtained by scanning two types of tips .",
    "tip a was coated with a @xmath39 pt layer and was moderately paramagnetic ( @xmath40 ) @xcite .",
    "tip b was a bare diamond nanowire and weakly diamagnetic ( @xmath41 ) @xcite .",
    "the two figures clearly show how the paramagnetic tip is attracted to the center of the write pole ( where the magnetic field is highest ) , while the diamagnetic tip is repelled from the high field region .",
    "these measurements demonstrate that the technique is sensitive to the sign of @xmath10 .      although our measurements record images of the magnetic force @xmath42 , and not the field @xmath13 , we can rigorously reconstruct the magnetic field and the gradient from a force map . by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : force ] ) along the @xmath24-direction , one obtains an expression for the magnetostatic energy of the tip as a function of position , @xmath43 this expression can be used to deduce the magnetic field , @xmath44^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "we have quantitatively determined @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the force map of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_4]d by calibrating the magnitude of the force and the effective tip volume ( @xmath47 , tip b ) ( see supplementary figures 2 - 4 and supplementary notes 1 - 2 ) .",
    "the resulting field maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_5]a , b . a region of high field is seen over the pole surface , as expected , with a sharp drop of high gradient just to the right . despite the relatively low drive current ( @xmath48 ) and large tip standoff ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "magnetic fields and gradients are already quite sizable with peak values around @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "to estimate the maximum field and gradient that can possibly be generated at the tip location , we measured the dipole force as a function of tip - surface distance @xmath52 and as a function of the drive current @xmath12 .",
    "these measurements are also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_5 ] . as the distance between tip and pole surface was reduced , the signal increased until non - contact friction @xcite began to dampen the mechanical oscillation .",
    "the signal decayed exponentially with distance with characteristic length @xmath53 for tip b ( fig . [ fig : fig_5]c ) and @xmath54 for tip a ( see supplementary figure 5 ) .",
    "the signal decay is thus not influenced by the tip shape .",
    "we found using numerical modeling that @xmath55 is mainly set by the width of the write pole near the trailing gap , which was about @xmath56 in our devices .    to test the maximum drive current ,",
    "we have monitored the signal from tip b while increasing the drive beyond the failure current density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_5]d ) .",
    "the signal continued to increase up to a breakdown current of @xmath57 , showing that the write pole had not reached magnetic saturation .",
    "we have modeled the magnetic response based on a langevin magnetization curve with a saturation field of @xmath58 ( feco ) @xcite and found that the pole magnetization at @xmath59 is about @xmath60 , or roughly 65% of the saturation magnetization ( see supplementary note 3 ) .",
    "note that the power dissipation is small even at the maximum driving amplitude .",
    "for a write head resistance of @xmath61 ( that should ideally be achievable ) , the dissipated power is only @xmath62 even when the coil is continuously driven with @xmath59 . in our experiments the total dissipated power was in fact limited by lead and contact resistances , and not the write element . in pulsed mode and at low duty cycle",
    ", we expect that saturation can be reached with less than @xmath63 average dissipation , eventually permitting millikelvin operation .",
    "table [ table : gradient ] collects some key experimental values for the magnetic field @xmath45 and field gradient @xmath46 , representative for a tip standoff of @xmath64 .",
    "the values are based on the force map in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_4]b and on the scaling of the force with drive current @xmath12 and distance @xmath52 .",
    "the experiment demonstrates that magnetic fields around @xmath65 and gradients around @xmath66 are present at @xmath59 drive , about @xmath67 larger than the gradients observed with static nanoscale ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "even larger gradients are expected under magnetic saturation , which could be reached by pulsing or by an external bias field .",
    "the experimental results are consistent with an independent finite element calculation ( that shared no common input parameters ) which predicts slightly smaller , but overall similar values ( see table [ table : gradient ] ) .",
    "the large gradient is a result of the close access ( @xmath68 ) enabled by the diamond nanowire tips , and also thanks to the recessed nature of the pole that prevents oxidation and allows for sharp , highly magnetized pole edges .",
    "write head gradient sources could therefore enable important steps forward in mechanical detection of electronic and nuclear spins . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_5]c , forces up to @xmath69 are generated with a net magnetic moment of only @xmath70 , roughly equivalent to @xmath71 .",
    "this represents a strong force per electron spin of about @xmath72 . since the force sensitivity of the transducer of @xmath73 per root hz is maintained even at @xmath64 spacing ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_5]e ) , an excellent magnetic moment sensitivity of @xmath74 per root hz results , which is equivalent to about 21 proton moments per root hz .",
    "this value improves to @xmath75 proton moments if the pole is magnetically saturated . by comparison , the best reported",
    "sensitivities for previous force detectors are @xmath76 proton moments @xcite , and @xmath77 proton moments for scanning squid sensors @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity is even more remarkable since the performance of the force transducer was not particularly optimized in our study .",
    "it could be further enhanced by surface passivation @xcite , change of material @xcite , or lower operating temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that write head gradients will pave the way for single nuclear spin detection .",
    "this will constitute a milestone advance towards the realization of the long - standing proposal of single nucleon magnetic resonance imaging @xcite .",
    "the depth resolution of such imaging would be limited by the decay length of the pole field , which is @xmath78 for the write heads used in our study .",
    "this is a significant depth resolution compared to other candidate imaging techniques , like nitrogen - vacancy spin sensors , where single - spin sensitivity does not extend beyond a few nm @xcite .    aside from the detection of magnetic forces ,",
    "the use of write heads may allow for significant advances in several fields of active research .",
    "perhaps the most important of these is the manipulation of spin systems in the context of quantum technologies @xcite .",
    "static magnetic field gradients can be used for rapid spin manipulation by means of electrical fields @xcite or quantum dot exchange interaction @xcite , and for strong and tunable coupling in hybrid quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the gradient can further be exploited to set up spin registers in quantum simulators @xcite .",
    "the combination of large field and rapid switching @xcite , which is difficult to achieve in typical research devices , will allow the implementation of very fast spin manipulation through magnetic resonance techniques @xcite . at a pulse amplitude of @xmath79 ,",
    "the nominal spin flip duration is @xmath80 for electrons and @xmath81 for protons , which would be faster than any previously demonstrated values @xcite .",
    "these flip rates will eventually be limited by the response time of the write head and pole material @xcite .",
    "universal spin control requires two orthogonal axes of rotation .",
    "although the write head only provides one axis given by the direction of @xmath82 , there are several possible ways to add a second axis , as proposed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_6 ] . beyond spin control ,",
    "write head devices may finally present creative new opportunities in nanoscale transport . for example , pulsed spin polarized currents could be launched through local magnetization of ferromagnetic electrodes @xcite .",
    "electrons in confined geometries , such as quantum point contacts , could be locally deflected and the magnetic potential varied within the ballistic regime . since write heads have an extremely flat surface made from nonconducting diamond - like carbon , complex lithographic structures including local gates , microwires , constrictions , quantum dots or spin qubits could be conveniently integrated .",
    "_ write heads : _ the hard disc write heads ( wh ) used in this study were extracted from seagate barracuda 1 tb and 4 tb desktop drives . as a general rule , we worked on anti - static mats and grounded ourselves while working with the wh to avoid electrostatic discharges .",
    "care was taken to avoid physical contact with the trailing edge of the wh where the write / read regions are located .",
    "we opened the hard drive casing to gain access to the platter discs and the actuator arms .",
    "the wh blocks are located at the end of these arms .",
    "we severed the ends of the actuator arms using a pair of scissors , then peeled the wh block from its metal support with a pair of sharp tweezers .",
    "the backside of a wh block has a small circular dab of glue to fix it to the actuator arm .",
    "the glue turned out to be problematic for precise , flat positioning of the wh in our experiment . to remove this dab of dried glue , we flipped the wh block upside down on a clean silicon wafer and scratched the backside of the wh block with a sharp pair of tweezers wrapped in a couple layers of kimwipe until the back surface was completely clean and residue - free as determined by optical microscopy .",
    "a @xmath83 pt layer was evaporated on the wh surface to screen electric charges .    for low - temperature scanning probe experiments",
    ", we fixed the wh on top of a sample stage made from shapal , an aluminum nitride ceramics with excellent thermal conductivity ( see supplementary figure 6 ) .",
    "we avoided metal as material for the stage to prevent eddy - current damping of radio - frequency magnetic fields that would eventually be used in nuclear spin - manipulation experiments .",
    "a total of nine metal bonding pads were found on the side of the wh block .",
    "two of the nine pads were connected to the current - carrying coil inside the wh block for controlling write pole magnetization direction .",
    "we identified the two relevant coil leads through trial and error by using magnetic force microscopy for readout verification ( see supplementary figure 7 ) . for electrical contact to macroscopic wires",
    ", we used a silicon jumper chip with lithographically patterned gold thin film structure matching the pad dimensions .",
    "the mechanical and electric reassembly process took place in the following sequence .",
    "we first glued the jumper chip to the shapal stage using an insulating glue compatible with high vacuum and cryogenic temperatures ( epotek h70e ) .",
    "we glued copper wires to the two metal pads on the jumper chip using a conducting epoxy ( epotek h20e ) and mechanically fixed them with an additional layer of epotek h70e .",
    "next , the wh block was carefully positioned such that the two leads for the write pole were aligned with the corresponding leads on the jumper chip , and then fixed using epotek h70e .",
    "finally , electrical contact between the wh and the jumper chip was established using epotek h20e with the aid of a hydraulic micromanipulator system ( narishige three - axis hanging joystick oil hydraulic micromanipulator , model : mmo-202nd ) operated under an optical microscope . finally , we used an asylum research cypher mfm to confirm successful electrical control of the write pole magnetization ( see supplementary figures 7 - 8 ) .    _ diamond nanowire tips : _ single - crystal diamond nanowire ( dnw ) tips were fabricated via inductively - coupled plasma etching following procedures detailed in a previous publication @xcite .",
