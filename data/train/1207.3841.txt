    "<S> dispersion in integrated ring resonators is composed of material dispersion ( which is normal for at all visible and near - infrared wavelengths ) , geometric dispersion due to the waveguide cross - section @xcite , as well as an additional contribution from the finite resonator radius as observed in whispering - gallery - mode microcavities @xcite . in previous numerical studies </S>",
