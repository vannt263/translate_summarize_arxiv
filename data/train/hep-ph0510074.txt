    "the position of the edges can be expressed in terms of the neutralino and intermediate slepton masses @xcite : @xmath199 in the case of the @xmath192 spectrum the first edge is practically invisible because the branching ratios of @xmath96 into @xmath200 and @xmath201 are tiny as can be seen in table  [ tab : br ] .",

    "lfv causes firstly a reduction of the height of the end point peak .",
    "secondly , it induces a difference between the @xmath204 and @xmath203 spectra because the mixings among the three slepton generations are in general different from one another .",
    "the peaks at @xmath193  gev in the @xmath204 and @xmath203 spectra are invisible as in the @xmath207 spectrum , for the same reason as mentioned above . as for the @xmath208 spetrum",
    "we remark that the height of the peak ( due to the intermediate @xmath130 ( @xmath209 ) ) in the @xmath208 spetrum gets reduced by about 5% and that the contributions due to the intermediate @xmath210 are invisible .",
    "moreover , the peak position gets shifted to a smaller value by about 2.7 gev since the mass of the intermediate @xmath130 gets reduced by 1 gev compared to the flavour conserving case .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the lfv case the rate of the channel @xmath1 can be larger than those of the channels with the same flavour , @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "moreover , by measuring all di - lepton spectra for the flavour violating as well as conserving channels , one can make an important cross check of this lfv scenario : the first peak position of the lepton flavour violating spectra ( except the @xmath207 spectrum ) must coincide with the end point of the @xmath208 spectrum and the second peak must coincide with those of the @xmath203 and @xmath204 spectra .    up to now",
    "we have investigated in detail the di - lepton mass spectra taking sps1a as a specific example . in the following we discuss which requirements other scenarios must fulfill to observe double - edge structures . obviously the kinematic condition @xmath211 must be fulfilled and sufficiently many @xmath212 must be produced . in addition",
    "there should be two sleptons contributing in a sizable way to the decay @xmath213 and , of course , the corresponding branching ratio has to be large enough to be observed .",
    "for this the corresponding lfv entries in the slepton mass matrix have to be large enough .",
    "moreover , also the mass difference between the two contributing sleptons has to be sufficiently large so that the difference of the positions of the two peaks is larger than the experimental resolution . in msugra - like scenarios the kinematic requirements ( including the positions of the peaks )",
    "are fulfilled in the regions of parameter space where @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the first condition provides for right sleptons lighter than the @xmath24 and the second condition ensures that the mass difference between @xmath3 and the other two right sleptons is sufficiently large . in the region where @xmath216 also the left sleptons are lighter than @xmath24 , giving the possibility of additional structures in the di - lepton mass spectra .",
    "we remark that sps1a is not the most favourable case because of the appearance of the decay @xmath217 which has quite a large branching ratio ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "for example in the original sps1a point this decay mode is absent allowing for much larger lfv branching ratios of @xmath24 .",
    "finally we briefly discuss background reactions in the lfv search at lhc .",
    "the largest sm background is due to @xmath219 production .",
    "there is also susy background due to uncorrelated leptons stemming from different squark and gluino decay chains .",
    "the resulting di - lepton mass distributions will , however , be smooth and decrease monotonically with increasing di - lepton invariant mass as was explicitly shown in a monte carlo analysis in @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the single edge structure can be observed over the smooth background in the @xmath207 and @xmath2 invariant mass distributions .",
    "therefore the novel distributions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dilepton ] , in particular the characteristic double - edge structures in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 invariant mass distributions , should be clearly visible on top of the background .",
    "note that the usual method for background suppression , by taking the sum @xmath220 , is not applicable in the case of lfv searches .",
    "instead one has to study the individual pair mass spectra .",
    "nevertheless , one can expect that these peaks will be well observable @xcite . here",
    "note also that the tau lepton could be identified by a hadronic `` tau jet '' though the double - edge structures in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra would get a smearing effect due to a neutrino emission @xcite . to show more clearly the observability of such lfv signals a detailed monte carlo study would be necessary .",

    "<S> we study lepton flavour violating decays of neutralinos and sleptons within the minimal supersymmetric standard model , assuming two and three generation mixings in the slepton sector . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account the most recent bounds on flavour violating rare lepton decays . </S>",
    "<S> taking the sps1a scenario as an example , we show that some of the lepton flavour violating branching ratios of neutralinos and sleptons can be sizable ( @xmath0 5 - 10% ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study the impact of the lepton flavour violating neutralino and slepton decays on the di - lepton mass distributions measured at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that they can result in novel and characteristic edge structures in the distributions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , double - edge structures can appear in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mass spectra if @xmath3 is the lightest slepton . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of these remarkable structures provides a powerful test of supersymmetric lepton flavour violation at lhc .    </S>",
