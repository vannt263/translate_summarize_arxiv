    "robotic manipulation of deformable objects is a challenging problem especially because of the complexity of the many different ways an object can deform .",
    "searching within such a high dimensional state space makes it difficult to recognize , track , and manipulate deformable objects . in this paper",
    "we present a feed - forward , model - driven approach to address this challenge , using a pre - computed , simulated database of deformable thin - shell object models , where the bending of the mesh models is predominant @xcite .",
    "the models are detailed , robust , and easy to construct , and using a physics engine one can accurately predict the behavior of the objects in simulation , which can then be applied to a real physical setting .",
    "this work bridges the gap between the simulation world and the real world .",
    "the predictive , feed - forward , model - driven approach takes advantages of the simulation and generates a large number of instances for learning approaches , which not only alleviates the burden of data collection , which can be efficiently done in simulation , but also makes adaptation of the methods to other application areas easier and faster .",
    "mesh models of common deformable garments are simulated with the garments picked up in multiple different poses under gravity , and stored in a database for fast and efficient retrieval . to validate this approach",
    ", we developed a comprehensive pipeline for manipulating clothing as in a typical laundry task .",
    "first , the database is used to estimate categories and poses of garments in arbitrary positions . a fully featured 3d volumetric model of the garment",
    "is constructed in real - time and volumetric features are then used to obtain the most similar model in the database to predict the object category and pose .",
    "second , the database can significantly benefit the manipulation of deformable objects via non - rigid registration , providing accurate correspondences between the reconstructed object model and the database models .",
    "third , the accurate model simulation can also be used to optimize the trajectories for manipulation of deformable objects , such as the folding of garments .",
    "in addition , the simulation can be easily adapted to new garment models .",
    "extensive experimental results are shown for the tasks above using a variety of different clothing .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we introduced a simulation database of common deformable garments to facilitate recognition and manipulation .",
    "the database contains five different garments within three categories : sweater , pants , and shorts .",
    "each garment is fully simulated with a number of depth images and 3d mesh models for all the semantic labeled grasping points .",
    "we demonstrated three applications of using the database to improve the recognition and the manipulation of deformable objects .",
    "the first is training from the simulated mesh models to recognizing an unknown object by 3d shape - based features .",
    "the second is applying the simulated mesh model to guide the iterative regrasping of the garment using both rigid and non - rigid registrations .",
    "the third is importing the mesh model into the simulator and computing optimized trajectories for manipulation of the deformable objects .",
    "ee extensively tested the three applications with designed experiments such as garment recognition via pick up , unfolding the garment to a known desired state and laying flat , and using pe - computed folding plans to fold it using a novel trajecotry optimization method that prevents common folding errors .",
    "we have addressed all the phases of the pipeline in figure [ fig : entire_pipeline ] individually . however , there are still some system and hardware issues that prevent the system from being a completely seamless pipeline .",
    "these are due to 1 ) kinematic constraints on the baxter robot which limits its ability to work with larger garments on a normal size table , and 2 ) our need to manually mount the iron on the robot hand for the ironing task .",
    "while the focus of our work has been on clothing , we want to underline the point that model - driven , feed forward prediction can work well in complex environments with many unknown states . while we have not yet attempted this , we believe that the ideas in this paper can be ported to similar domains such as food handling (  soft deformable objects \" ) and articulated rigid objects that have multiple kinematic states .",
    "we d like to thank j. weisz , j. varley , and r. ying for many discussions , p. m. lopez for the help of folding plan .",
    "we d also like to thank nvidia corporation , and intel corporation for the hardware support .",
