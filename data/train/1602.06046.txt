    "<S> although the symmetry analysis indicates that each @xmath15 orbital comprising the gold surface states couples to spinors in the same way as in the case of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , since the surface states of au has almost no in - plane @xmath15-orbital character , the spin degree of freedom is _ not _ entangled with the orbital ones . </S>",

    "<S> the light polarization vectors for these two cases are the same except that the signs of their out - of - plane components are opposite . because the spinors attached to in - plane and out - of - plane @xmath15 orbitals interfere with each other differently in the two cases , the corresponding * p * s are in principle different . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is sizable for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ( 111 ) [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s2p](a ) ] but is negligible for au ( 111 ) [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath34 ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath56 ( i.e. , normal incidence ) , @xmath57 , and only the in - plane @xmath15 orbitals are probed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in this case , @xmath33 of photoelectrons from both bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and au surfaces changes slowly with @xmath37 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath34 increases from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , @xmath55 becomes finite ; therefore , the dependence of @xmath33 of photoelectrons from au ( 111 ) on @xmath37 significantly changes , becoming similar to that corresponding to @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , however , this increase in @xmath34 does not have such a huge effect on @xmath33 .    from the results of our calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we can understand the hitherto incomprehensible differences in the results of sarpes experiments on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and au surfaces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the light with _ perfect _ s - polarization excites a surface state , the measured * p * must be antiparallel to the spin polarization of the surface state for both bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and au . in real experiments , however , the `` s - polarized '' light may contain a few percent of the p component due to the imperfection of the polarizer , the inaccuracy in the alignment , or the inhomogeneity of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ s2p](b ) ] suggest that this small fraction of p - polarized light may determine the spin polarization of photoelectrons from au ( 111 ) , which explains the experimental result  @xcite that s- and p - polarized lights produce photoelectrons with similar * p * s and that photo - induced spin modulation is hard to achieve with au ( 111 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the sarpes configuration @xmath25 and @xmath61 , i.e. , photons and electrons have the in - plane momenta parallel to @xmath16 . in this case , no symmetry principle restricts the spin direction of surface electrons or photoelectrons . nevertheless , when @xmath62 of a surface state is small , according to first - order @xmath63 perturbation theory  @xcite , the @xmath4 and @xmath52 orbitals in the surface states always couple to the spinor @xmath64 and the @xmath5 orbital to @xmath65 in the upper branch , where @xmath65 and @xmath64 are the eigenspinors of @xmath66 with eigenvalues 1 and @xmath44 , respectively . </S>",
