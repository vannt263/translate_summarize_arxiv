    "cp violations in the neutrino seesaw models have recently attracted much attention because the measurements of cp violation via neutrino oscillation are being planned in future experiments and there may exist a connection between the low energy neutrino cp violation and the matter and anti - matter asymmetry of the universe through the leptogenesis scenario in the seesaw models @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the quark sector , since the number of independent cp violating phases in the neutrino seesaw models is more than one@xcite , it is not straightforward to discriminate the cp violating phases contributing to the leptogenesis from the low energy experiments @xcite .",
    "one can show that the cp violation phases at high energy can contribute to the low energy effective majorana mass matrix and thus they may be concerned with a cp violating phase called @xmath4 in the standard parametrization of mns matrix , which is measurable from cp violation in neutrino oscillation .",
    "one might think that non - zero @xmath4 may play a role in cp violation for leptogenesis in the neutrino seesaw models . however , this is not always the case , because several independent cp phases contribute to both the leptogenesis cp violation at high energy and cp violation of neutrino oscillation at low energy .",
    "there is the case in which while at low energy the total effect of many cp phases are cancelled but at high energy cosmological cp violation remains .",
    "there is the opposite case in which the cosmological cp violation vanishes while cp violation at low energy is non - zero .",
    "considering the situation , it is important to study cp violation phenomena as much as possible both at high energy and low energy . in the previous work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the lepton family asymmetries @xmath5,@xmath6 and @xmath7 which are generated by heavy majorana neutrinos decays are sensitive to one of the many cp violating phases .",
    "though the total lepton asymmetry @xmath8 remains as a constant , flavor composition of the asymmetries @xmath9 can vary by changing the phase . as a particulary interesting case , the amount and the sign of each lepton family asymmetry @xmath10 can be very different from the total lepton asymmetry as @xmath11 .",
    "one can also find the case @xcite , the lepton asymmetry @xmath12 could be dominated by a particular lepton family asymmetry as @xmath13 or @xmath14 . if this is the case , it indicates the interesting scenario of baryogenesis that the matter in the present universe was originated by the second or the third family of leptons .",
    "interestingly , the models proposed in @xcite correspond to the @xmath15 or @xmath16 family number dominant leptogenesis scenarios . in this work ,",
    "we study how such scenario can be probed by low energy flavor violating processes such as neutrino oscillations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ,",
    "we study how cp violating phases are related to lepton family asymmetries .",
    "the reason why , in general , the family asymmetries can be different from the total lepton number asymmetry is shown in a comprehensive way . then we show how they have some impact on the cp violation in the neutrino mixings by deriving the formula for low energy cp violation neutrino mixings in terms of the fundamental parameters for the minimal seesaw model . the analytical formulae for mns matrix are given both for normal and inverted cases . in section , we focus on the textures with two zeros in yukawa mass terms . by using the mixing angles and",
    "mass squared diffrences determined by neutrino oscillation experiments , we determine the parameters of the models and make prediction on @xmath3 and cp violation in neutrino oscillation . based on this numerical fit , we reconstruct the leptonic unitarity triangles .",
