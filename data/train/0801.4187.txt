    "abundance studies of very metal - poor ( vmp ; [ fe / h ] @xmath3 ) = @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for elements a and b. ] stars have been pursued over the past few decades in order to constrain models of nucleosynthesis , stellar evolution , and early chemical enrichment in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one important result of these studies is the discovery of carbon enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars , which appear with increasing frequency at lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "these stars may be closely related to carbon stars in the galactic halo , known as ch stars @xcite and subgiant ch stars @xcite .",
    "recent chemical abundance studies for cemp stars have revealed that most ( 7080% ) cemp stars also exhibit excesses of s - process elements such as ba ( the cemp - s stars , according to beers & christlieb 2005 ) , indicating that the origin of the carbon excesses in these stars is likely to be the triple-@xmath6 reaction in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the cemp stars that are observed at present are likely to have been polluted by the transfer of carbon - enhanced material from a ( former ) agb companion across a binary system , while the agb star itself has now evolved to an unseen white dwarf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the abundance patterns of heavy elements in these stars provide useful constraints on models for s - process nucleosynthesis in agb stars . on the order of 20% of cemp stars exhibit no significant enhancement of their neutron - capture elements ( the cemp - no stars , according to beers & christlieb 2005 ) , suggesting the existence of other possible origins for their carbon excesses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have shown that the cemp - no stars generally occur at very low [ fe / h ] ; extreme examples of this class of stars include he  01075240 and he  13272326 , two hyper metal - poor ( hmp ) stars with [ fe / h ] below @xmath7 @xcite and having very large carbon excesses ( [ c / fe ] @xmath8 ) , as well as the recently identified ultra metal - poor ( ump ; [ fe / h ] = @xmath9 ) star he  0557 - 4840 , with [ c / fe ] @xmath10 ( norris et al .",
    "2007 ) .    among the cemp stars for which chemical compositions have been obtained from high - resolution spectroscopy",
    ", main - sequence turn - off stars are expected to be of particular importance . in the case of mass transfer in binary systems ,",
    "the accreted material from the primary agb star has been mixed at least by the first dredge - up in red giants , while turn - off stars might preserve pure material accreted from the primary at their surfaces . in such cases",
    ", one can investigate the efficiency of the production of carbon and neutron - capture elements in agb stars from abundance measurements of the secondary star .",
    "another interesting view arises from the suggested influence of so - called thermohaline mixing ( charbonnel & zahn 2007 ; stancliffe et al . 2007 ; denissenkov & pinsonneault 2007 ) , which provides the possibility of mixing the accreted surface material while the observed star is still on the main - sequence or only slightly evolved , prior to first dredge - up . in this scenario ,",
    "the contrast of the observed surface abundances of cemp turn - off stars with more evolved cemp stars also provides valuable clues to the nature of this proposed extensive mixing process .",
    "very large new samples of cemp stars have recently become available , discovered during the course of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "although originally designed as an extragalactic survey , sdss has also discovered large numbers of vmp stars @xcite .",
    "although some of the cemp stars are the result of directed studies ( margon et al .",
    "2002 ; downes et al . 2004 ) , many of them have appeared among the calibration objects used by sdss to obtain spectrophotometric and telluric corrections for other spectroscopic data . these calibration stars are primarily brighter , metal - poor main - sequence turn - off f- and g - type stars .",
    "the ongoing extension to sdss , sdss - ii ( which includes the program segue : sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ) , is expected to provide tens of thousands of additional vmp stars , at least several thousand of which are expected to be cemp stars .",
    "this paper reports the first application of abundance measurements obtained with high - resolution spectroscopy for cemp star candidates found by the sdss / segue surveys .    in  2",
    "we discuss the identification of our sample stars and the observations that were carried out .",
    "a description of our analysis techniques and results is provided in  3 . in ",
    "4 we present a discussion of our findings .",
    "the interesting kinematics of the sdss / segue cemp turn - off stars are discussed in  5 .",
    "we conclude with a few remarks in  6 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey uses a ccd camera ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) on a dedicated 2.5 m telescope ( gunn et al . 2006 ) at apache point observatory , new mexico , to obtain images in five broad optical bands ( @xmath11 ; fukugita et al .  1996 ) over approximately 10,000  deg@xmath12 of the high galactic latitude sky . the survey data - processing software measures the properties of each detected object in the imaging data in all five bands , and determines and applies both astrometric and photometric calibrations ( pier et al .",

    "2007a , b ) , it was noticed that a rather large number of stars were present in the sdss / segue database with clearly enhanced ch g - band strengths , and which were likely to be cemp stars .",
    "a list of over 1000 candidate cemp stars was assembled , drawing in particular on the calibration stars used by sdss .",
    "the sample formed the basis for a detailed investigation of the frequency of cemp stars in the sdss database ( see marsteller et al . 2006 ; marsteller 2007 ) .",
    "a handful of the brighter examples of the cemp turn - off stars were identified for carrying out a pilot study of their high - resolution spectroscopic abundances , reported on herein .",

    "our spectra cover the wavelength range from 4050 to 6800   , with a gap between 5350 and 5450   due to the separation between the two detectors .",
    "a two - by - two pixel on - chip binning procedure was applied .",
    "the resolving power of the spectra obtained in 2006 is @xmath23 ( using a slit width of 0.6 ) , while that obtained during the 2007 run is somewhat lower ( @xmath24 ) because a wider slit width ( 0.9 ) was applied in order to collect sufficient photons under relatively poor seeing conditions .",

    "figure  [ fig : rv ] shows the radial velocities of lp  7067 and cs  29526110 obtained by the present work , along with additional measurements obtained during recent service observing runs with the subaru telescope .",
    "for lp  7067 , the results of @xcite are also shown .",
    "a clear variation of radial velocity is found for cs  29526110 , indicating that this object belongs to a binary system , although the orbital period is still unclear . on the other hand ,",
    "no evidence of variability is obtained for lp  7067 , as has been discussed by @xcite , even though we have now obtained data extending over a range of some 6000 days .",
    "it was immediately noticed during the first observing night of 2007 that significant variations existed in the observed doppler shift of sdss 1707 + 58 .",
    "figure [ fig : s0353 ] shows the spectra of this object before any shifts have been obtained prior to co - addition for later analysis .",
    "no velocity variation is found for the d emission lines associated with the earth s atmosphere at 5989.9 and 5995.9   , nor for the interstellar absorption feature due to na , found about 0.5   blueward of these emission lines , indicating that the wavelength calibration was correctly carried out over all exposures .",
    "in contrast , absorption due to the stellar features quickly shifted in the spectra obtained in the first observing night ( the upper three spectra in the figure ) , while no significant variation is found for those obtained during the second night .",
    "we note that the exposure times applied to the first and second observing nights are 40 and 20 minutes , respectively .",
    "the shift in the first night is about 18  km  s@xmath31 per 40 minutes .",
    "hence , the broad absorption features of the first three spectra are almost certainly due to a radial velocity shift during the exposures rather than stellar rotation or macro - turbulence .",
    "the radial velocities and line widths measured for each spectrum of sdss 1707 + 58 are listed in table  [ tab : s0353 ] .",
    "the measurements are made for strong , , and lines , because measurements from the lines for individual exposures were quite uncertain . during the course of this procedure ,",

    "the ut and jd ( heliocentric julian day ) of the central time of each exposure is listed in the table .",
    "a spectrum of this object , suitable for carrying out the abundance analysis described below , is obtained by combining individual spectra obtained during the first night , after applying the appropriate doppler corrections .",
    "radial velocities are also measured from the sdss spectra , as listed in table  [ tab : rv_sdss ] .",
    "the radial velocities of sdss 003610 , sdss 0126 + 06 , and sdss 0924 + 40 agree with the results from the subaru spectra within the measurement errors .",
    "the radial velocity of sdss 2047 + 00 on jd = 2,452,932 is significantly higher than the other three measurements , suggesting a radial velocity variation and binarity of this object .",
    "we note that this object shows large over - abundances of carbon and neutron - capture elements (  [ sec : ana ] ) that are expected from mass transfer in a binary system .",
    "the radial velocity of sdss 1707 + 58 from the sdss spectrum is within the variation found in the subaru spectra given in table  [ tab : s0353 ] .",
    "finally , the radial velocity of sdss 0817 + 26 from the sdss spectrum , 45.8 @xmath32 km sec@xmath31 , is much higher than the value obtained from the hds spectrum",
    ". however , the measurement is only once for each instrument , so further measurement is required to derive any firm conclusions on the binarity of this object .",

    "scale are also listed in table  [ tab : photo ] . for cemp stars ,",
    "this color is sometimes severely affected by the presence of molecular absorption , and it is not preferable for temperature estimates .",
    "however , the molecular features of warm cemp stars studied here are not as significant as those for cooler stars , and would be expected to have less of an affect on the observed colors . moreover , the errors in the @xmath22-band photometry for some of the fainter objects in our sample are large ( see below ) , and the @xmath36 colors are relatively sensitive to the reddening correction .",
    "hence , the effective temperatures obtained from the @xmath37 colors are useful for comparison purposes .",

    "the @xmath13@xmath38 of the two coolest stars in our sample , lp  7067 and sdss 0924 + 40 , are lower than their @xmath13@xmath33 , perhaps as the result of their relatively strong ch molecular bands affecting the @xmath18-band measurement .",
    "a similar discrepancy between the two @xmath13 estimates is found for sdss 0817 + 26 , even though this object exhibits no or perhaps only a modest ( [ c / fe]@xmath39 ) carbon overabundance . however , the error in the @xmath22 photometry for this star is relatively large , which might explain the discrepancy .",
    "the @xmath40 of sdss 2047 + 00 is quite high ( 6800  k ) for a vmp turn - off star .",

    "we adopt @xmath13 = 6600  k , which is slightly lower than the estimate from the @xmath36 color .",
    "the @xmath13 of cs  29526110 is also quite high ( 6800  k ) .",
    "however , the reported error of the @xmath22 photometry for this object is 0.03 magnitudes , and the reddening correction adopted ( 0.033 magnitudes ) is not large . for this object ,",

    "this was interpreted as an indication that ( 1 ) the [ c / h ] ratios produced by agb stars are almost constant at [ c / h ] @xmath99 , independent of metallicity , and ( 2 ) the carbon - enhanced material transferred from agb stars to the companion is directly observed , or is only slightly diluted through the evolution from turn - off stars to giants . in this study we confirmed the absence of objects having [ c / h ] @xmath100 , found that the average of the [ c / h ] values for cemp turn - off stars is higher than that of giants , and that their dispersion is smaller .",
    "this result supports the interpretation of @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the process of thermohaline mixing in main - sequence stars that received carbon - enhanced material from a companion agb star across a binary system .",
    "they predicted that the accreted material quickly mixes throughout 90% of the star , and that the enhanced carbon is diluted in main - sequence stars as a result .",
    "the c abundance is predicted to change only slightly after the receiving star evolves through first dredge - up .",
    "this is not supported by the comparison of [ c / h ] distributions in figure  [ fig : hist_ch ] , although the possible bias in the sample selection could slightly affect the comparison .",
    "our present observational result suggests that the [ c / h ] ratios measured for turn - off stars represents the values produced by the donor agb stars , and the surface carbon abundance decreases in some cemp stars during their evolution after the first dredge - up .",

    "this agreement supports the above interpretation .",

    "it is noteworthy that these two stars both exhibit very large excesses of nitrogen  the [ n / fe ] of cs  29528041 is + 3.0 @xcite and that of cs  30322023 is + 2.8 @xcite .",
    "their [ ( c+n)/h ] values are @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively , which are not by far lower than those of other stars , although the nitrogen abundances are not determined for several stars including our sdss sample . cs  30322023 is a highly evolved giant , and possibly presently in the agb stage ( according to masseron et al . ) ; its surface composition could have been altered significantly during its evolution .",
    "the observed nitrogen excess of cs  29528041 should instead be a direct result of the nucleosynthesis in a donor agb star . as discussed by @xcite , cs  29528041",
    "might have been polluted by an intermediate - mass agb star in which nitrogen is enriched by the hot bottom burning process .      based on their",
    "observed [ c / h ] distribution , we have interpreted the surface abundances of cemp turn - off stars to represent the yields of the agb donors .",
    "if this is indeed the case , [ ba / h ] can be used as an indicator of the s - process efficiency in the donor stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist_bah ] depicts the distribution of [ ba / h ] for the cemp turn - off stars and giants that show excesses of ba ( [ ba / fe ] @xmath104 ) . the [ ba / h ] of the turn - off stars exhibits a wider distribution than was observed for their [ c / h ] .",

    "the wider distribution of [ ba / h ] of these stars , as compared to [ c / h ] , implies that the ba abundances produced by agb stars are likely to have a significantly larger intrinsic dispersion .",
    "the abundance ratios currently observed are those of the material transferred from the donor agb stars , which would be dependent on the evolutionary phase in which the mass transfer occurred .",
    "the abundances of carbon and ba are expected to increase with increasing the number of thermal pulses .",

    "the [ sr / ba ] ratios are distributed over a narrow range ( a standard deviation of 0.34  dex ) around [ sr / ba ] @xmath106 .",

    "that is , the production efficiency of the heavy neutron - capture elements , with respect to the light ones , apparently increases slightly with the total production efficiency of neutron - capture elements .",
    "it should be noted that the [ sr / ba ] ratios in these stars are lower than the prediction from models of the s - process in agb stars by @xcite : the [ ls / hs](@xmath107[hs / ls ] ) values of their calculations , where ls and hs mean the elements in the first and second abundance peaks of the s - process , range between 0 to @xmath108 , depending on stellar mass and choice of @xmath109c pocket , for the metallicity range of [ fe / h]@xmath110 .",

    "a similar correlation was found from the abundance measurements for carbon - rich post - agb stars by @xcite .",
    "they reported a positive correlation between the enhancement of s - process elements ( [ s / fe ] , which is the mean of the abundance ratios of several s - process elements ) and the abundance ratios of heavy to light neutron - capture elements ( [ hs / ls ] ) .",
    "we note that the efficiency of the neutron - capture nucleosynthesis is represented by [ s / fe ] in @xcite , while it is evaluated by [ ba / h ] in our investigation .",
    "however , a correlation between [ sr / ba ] and [ ba / fe ] is also found in our sample at a similar confidence level as that between [ sr / ba ] and [ ba / h ] .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : srbapb ] suggests that there may exist a correlation for [ ba / pb ] with [ ba / h ] , but this essentially depends on only one object ( he  00242523 ) , with [ ba / h ] @xmath111 and [ ba / pb ] @xmath112 .",
