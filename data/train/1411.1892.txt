    "up to now , experiments have established the fact that neutrinos oscillate among each other . two mass - squared differences ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , together with",
    "all three mixing angles(@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) have been measured@xcite , prompting us that at least two generations of neutrinos among the three are massive .",
    "type i see - saw mechanism is a way to generate small majorana neutrino masses@xcite by introducing lepton number violating @xmath6 majorana mass term for right - handed neutrinos . on the other hand , in the framework of supersymmetry ,",
    "after the lepton number is violated , one - loop radiative corrections naturally generate non - zero neutrino mass terms@xcite .",
    "it is possible to generate realistic neutrino spectrum by introducing just one right - handed neutrino in supersymmetry .",
    "minimal supersymmetry standard model ( mssm ) extended with one right - handed neutrino is discussed in @xcite .",
    "considering both tree - level see - saw mechanism and the one - loop radiative corrections@xcite , one right - handed neutrino is enough to generate masses for three generations of neutrinos .",
    "however , mssm suffers from the @xmath0 problem .",
    "next to minimal supersymmetry standard model ( nmssm)@xcite extended with one right - handed neutrino was originally discussed in @xcite , @xcite @xcite , where right - handed neutrinos acquire tev - scale majorana mass terms through their couplings with the singlet higgs superfield s introduced in nmssm .",
    "this coupling also establishes the connection between the right - handed neutrinos with the higgs sectors , which may influence the phenomenology of the higgs bosons . the possibility that right - handed neutrino in the framework of nmssm may contribute to the higgs boson mass",
    "is also discussed in @xcite .    in this paper , we will show that nmssm extended with a single right - handed neutrino superfield can generate the complete neutrino mass spectrum considering both contributions from the tree - level type - i see - saw mechanism and one - loop radiative corrections .",
    "we will show that this model contains all the possibilities of the size of mixing angles .",
    "it is because once the correct mass spectrum is generated , it is almost free for us to rotate the mass matrix , with little experimental limitations .",
    "we also considered other experimental constraints and calculated the corrections of the higgs boson mass from the contributions of the right - handed neutrino@xcite , and gave some numerical results .",
    "here we impose a global @xmath7 symmetry and keep the r - parity conservation , just as usual nmssm with @xmath7 symmetry@xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 quantum number assigned to the right - handed neutrino @xmath8 is the same as singlet higgs @xmath9 , while the r - parity of @xmath8 is set as positive , just as other mssm matter superfields .",
    "thus the involved superpotential is strongly limited into the form @xmath10 where @xmath9 is the singlet higgs superfield originally existed in nmssm , and @xmath8 is the right - handed neutrino . here",
    "we only listed the terms involving lepton and higgs fields .",
    "the relevant soft terms breaking the supersymmetry are listed below , @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "one might consider a more compact model that @xmath8 just plays the role of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , this model breaks r - parity and do not contain dark matter .",
    "if scalar @xmath13 acquires a vacuum expectation value(vev ) @xmath14 , @xmath15 terms like @xmath16 appears , which supplies the @xmath6 quadratic terms in the sneutrino sector , contributing to the one - loop neutrino mass corrections .",
    "the vevs of the doublet higgs fields are defined as @xmath17    treelevel    ( 150,60 )    neutrinos then acquire tree - level majorana mass terms after integrating out the fermionic @xmath8 through figure [ tree_see_saw ] @xcite , @xmath18 because @xmath19 , matrix @xmath20 has only one non - zero eigenvalue , which leave other neutrinos massless .",
    "now that we are considering a supersymmetric theory , each particle is paired up with a super - partner , so is the right - handed neutrino .",
    "thus , right - handed scalar - neutrino contribute into the mass terms of neutrino through radiative corrections in figure [ loop_level ] . as mentioned in @xcite , in order for the loop - level neutrino mass terms not to be aligned with the tree level ones , we also need cross terms in the sneutrino soft mass - squared matrix @xmath21 which result in flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes in the lepton sector .",
    "looplevel    ( 150,60 )    from figure [ loop_level ] , we can estimate the loop - level neutrino mass , @xmath22 where m is the typical mass scale of the propagators in the loop , @xmath23 is the off - diagonal elements of the soft mass - square matrix of the left - handed leptons .",
    "fortunately , for tev see - saw mechanics , @xmath24 tend to be rather small and are @xmath25 , which is comparable with the electron higgs yukawa coupling term , thus allows relatively large @xmath26 , which significantly increase the @xmath27 , and its phenomenological effects are also highly suppressed by the factor @xmath24 which always appear together with @xmath26 .",
    "figure [ loop_level ] is based upon the `` mass insertion method '' , which is clear in concept , however is complicated to be calculated when the number of `` crosses '' inserted into a propagator are many .",
    "unlike @xcite , in this paper we only use `` mass insertion method '' to analyse qualitatively however calculate directly in mass - eigenstate basis quantitatively through figure [ loop_level_mass_basis ] .",
    "looplevelmasseigen    ( 150,60 )    calculating in mass - eigenstate basis according to figure [ loop_level_mass_basis ] involves a summation over a group of graphs with different real scalar propagators .",
    "each graph in figure [ loop_level_mass_basis ] is infinite , unlike figure [ loop_level ] .",
    "if we use the dimensional regularization scheme , all @xmath28 terms appear in each diagram should be accurately cancelled , the non - zero remains of the finite part is just due to difference of the masses and the mixing between the real part and the imaginary part of each scalar field .",
    "the mixing among scalar fields can not be omitted even though they re small , exceeding the capability of ordinary computational numeric float - point data types , however , we use gmp / mpfr to deal with it",
    ".    calculating one single diagram in figure [ loop_level_mass_basis ] generates the result @xmath29 particularly , when @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 separately indicates the mass of the majorana particle and the real scalar particle running in the loop .",
    "@xmath0 can be any mass - scale and must be accurately cancelled into disappearance after summing over all corresponding diagrams . in ( [ single_diagram_1 ] ) and ( [ single_diagram_2 ] )",
    ", we also dropped the divergent @xmath28 for simplicity , which we know that should also be cancelled finally .",
    "we define @xmath34 notice that according to ( [ superfield ] ) ( [ soft_term ] ) , when @xmath13 acquires vacuum expectation value @xmath14 , @xmath35 terms are generated and thus split the mass spectrum of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and influence the spectrum of @xmath38 and @xmath39 through mixture between right - handed and left - handed sneutrinos .",
    "the result of the @xmath40 mass - square matrix of sneutrinos is showed below , @xmath41    \\left [    \\begin{array}{cccc }      m_{\\nu , 3 \\times 3 } & y_n a_{yn } v_u & 0 & 0 \\\\      y_n a_{yn } v_u & m_r^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\      0 & 0 & m_{\\nu , 3 \\times 3 } & y_n a_{yn } v_u \\\\      0 & 0 & y_n a_{yn } v_u & m_i^2    \\end{array } \\right ]    \\left [    \\begin{array}{c }      \\tilde{v}_{ir } \\\\      \\tilde{n}_r \\\\      \\tilde{v}_{ii }",

    "in addition , @xmath45    from observing ( [ sneutrino_mass_matrix ] ) together with ( [ r_i_mass ] ) , we can learn that the mass split of the real and the imaginary part of @xmath46 was transferred into @xmath47 by the mixing term @xmath48 .",
    "then , there are 8 different real - scalar sneutrinos out of 3 left - handed neutrino and one right - handed neutrino superfields .",
    "diagram [ loop_level_mass_basis ] involves the neutrilinos .",
    "there are 5 neutrilinos in nmssm theory , each is a mixture of bino , neutral wino , 2 higgisinos and one singlino .",
    "sneutrinos interact with the neutral gauginos through the supersymmetry electro - weak gauge vertices , while interact with the higgisinos through the yukawa vertices .",
    "left - handed neutrinos do not directly interact with singlinos .",
    "however , on the circumstances of the tev - scale see - saw mechanism , gauge coupling constant ( typically @xmath49 ) is much greater than yukawa coupling constant ( typically @xmath50 ) , so the radiative one - loop contribution is mainly due to the bino and neutral winos .",

    "we have to mention that this model do not have the ability to predict any mixing angles , that is to say , any mixing angle is permitted if only the correct mass - squared difference is acquired .",
    "if we get an example of neutrino mass matrix @xmath55 with the correct mass spectrum , then we can always find a unitary matrix @xmath56 to rotate @xmath55 into the `` correct '' matrix @xmath57 with the `` correct '' mixing angles , that is to say , @xmath58 use the same @xmath56 to operate the all of the sneutrino soft mass - square matrix , the @xmath59 yukawa coupling constants @xmath60 , and the a - terms @xmath61 altogether into a new group of parameters to input into the theory , @xmath62 then we can always acquire `` correct '' @xmath63 .",
    "what we only need to consider is that whether these operations involving @xmath64 disturb the off - diagonal terms which generate large fcnc .",
    "in fact , as @xmath65 always hold , so the magnitude of @xmath66 do not change .",
    "therefore , in the processes of numeric calculation , we only concern about the neutrino mass - square hierarchy .",
    "we modified nmssmtools-4.2.1@xcite@xcite by adding the effects of our extended sectors .",
    "the @xmath67 yukawa coupling constants and the corresponding a terms are so small that their phenomenology effects are highly suppressed , thus we need nt consider them .",
    "we checked and followed @xcite together with @xcite to calculate the loop contribution to higgs mass , and see appendix for the process and formulae in detail .",
    "we also assume that only r - parity odd @xmath46 can be the candidate of dark matter , thus we modified the model files contained in the microomegas@xcite inside the nmssmtools .",
    "we opened the constraint on muon anomalous @xmath68 when scanning , which is so sensitive to the supersymmetry breaking soft masses of sleptons .",
    "though we need non - zero off - diagonal elements of the soft mass - square matrix of the left - handed leptons , they are constrained by experimental limits such as the branching ratio of @xmath69@xcite . in order to avoid such constraints , we need either relatively large slepton masses or small off - diagonal terms",
    ". however , the constraint of muon s @xmath70 prefers smaller supersymmetry breaking soft terms of sleptons , so we set the range @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for each @xmath73 . this scale can not avoid fcnc @xmath74 completely , however , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "when calculating neutrino mass matrix , cases are that accuracy of beyond @xmath75 is needed , so we used the numerical tools gmp / mpfr .",
    "however , this technique extremely slows down the speed , so we scanned avoiding to consider the neutrino masses at first , then calculate the neutrino mass matrices by testing in @xmath76-@xmath26-@xmath77 parameter space for each parameter point passed the previous constraints . we should note that if the lepton - number @xmath78 symmetry does not break , diagrams in fig .",
    "[ loop_level_mass_basis ] cancel with each other strictly .",
    "it is due to the existence of the lepton - number violating terms @xmath79 and @xmath80 that different diagrams in fig .",
    "[ loop_level_mass_basis ] can not be cancelled out strictly , leaving a small finite value , looking as if we are tuning something .",
    "as mentioned before , we need nt care about the mixing angles as they can always be acquired after exerting the mentioned process on each parameter point without disturbing the phenomenology .",
    "the scanning processes are divided into three steps .",
    "first of all , scan from parameter space @xmath81 during this step , nmssmtools is hardly modified except the lower - bound of the lightest higgs mass .",
    "the higgs mass bound is temporarily set as @xmath82 .",
    "just because we opened the anomalous @xmath83 constraints , we can see from figure [ mliimls ] that @xmath84 concentrate below 600gev .    then the second step to calculate the modification of the higgs mass by the right - handed neutrino sectors is applied .",
    "we modified nmssmtools-4.2.1 by changing the part of the higgs sectors considering the effects from the right - handed neutrino sectors . here",
    ", the higgs mass bound is set back to @xmath85 in order to filter the consequences output from the previous step .",
    "the final and the most important step is to decide the remaining parameters inside the range @xmath86 for each of the parameter point obtained from the last step .",
    "we scanned randomly in this area at first , and tested each point to see whether it can lead to the correct neutrino mass - squared difference , then start from the nearest point to `` jog '' near the correct position @xmath87 this process takes most of the time .",
    "if we rotate the basis of @xmath88 by a unitary matrix @xmath56 , the parameters @xmath60 , @xmath89(i is not summed up ) correspondingly behave like a `` vector - like representation '' of @xmath56 , so define the scalar - like norm of these two parameters @xmath90 though @xmath91 do not transform like a vector , we still define a `` scalar - like '' @xmath92     - @xmath93 plane , width=384 ]     - @xmath94 plane , width=384 ]     - @xmath94 plane , width=384 ]     contributed by right - handed neutrino , width=384 ]    figure [ ynayn ] , [ ynmls ] and [ mliimls ] show the parameter points from the aspects of @xmath93 - @xmath95 , @xmath93 - @xmath96 , @xmath84 - @xmath96 planes separately , where @xmath97 denotes the soft mass of the sneutrino . especially from the figure [ ynayn ]",
    ", we can confirm our previous discussion that relatively large @xmath98 are needed in order to generate a relatively large loop contribution to the originally massless neutrinos in tree - level .",
    "however , @xmath99 , which is so small that they can be ignored in most of the phenomenology analysis .",
    "one might believe that a large a - term could break the stability of the correct vacuum , resulting in some other deeper vacua , as mentioned in the ref .",
    "however , in this situation , we should also consider the gauge quartic terms such as @xmath100 , and the @xmath101 from other yukawa terms .",
    "after a some calculation , we can see these quartic terms actually stabilize the correct vacuum .",
    "in fact , when we calculate the contribution to higgs mass from the right - handed neutrino sectors , we omitted these a - terms . by the way ,",
    "figure [ mhiggs ] shows that higgs mass does have the possibility to recieve a relatively large correction , which is compatible with that in @xcite .",
    "although we would like the @xmath26 terms to be large enough in order for the loop corrections to be comparable with the tree - level terms , loop - corrections still tend to be smaller .",
    "they only give smaller masses to the two neutrinos which are originally massless up to tree - level see - saw mechanism .",
    "thus , we predict a normal - hierarchy mass spectrum of neutrinos without any degeneracy .",
    "we have mentioned that we need off - diagonal terms in the soft mass - squared terms of sleptons , which may lead to visible @xmath69 decay .",
    "the branching ratio of this chain is estimated in @xcite @xmath102 from the data showed in figure [ mliimls ] , we can estimate that @xmath103 varies from @xmath104 .",
    "compared with the pdg data @xmath105@xcite , it means at least some of the points have passed the constraint and some are on the edge of the experimental bound . as mentioned before ,",
    "if we assume that the source of muon anomalous @xmath68 comes from the nmssm sectors , the soft masses of sleptons are strictly constrained to be much smaller than @xmath106 , and we imposed this constraint during our scanning procedure .",
    "if we release such a constraint , the slepton mass can reach above @xmath107 so that @xmath69 decay is totally invisible .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , bounds on other muon fcnc decay channels are listed , such as @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "these bounds on branching ratios are roughly of the similar order of magnitude of @xmath69 , but their feynmann - diagrams usually involve a higher - order perturbative expansion , thus the effects are depressed , so we did not discuss them . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath110-fcnc bounds are much looser , so we did not talk about them either .",
    "as mentioned in appendix i , tev scale right - handed neutrinos have no hope to become dark matter , as they usually decay quickly .",
    "if r - parity is conserved , the scalar partner of @xmath8 might become the lsp , thus the candidate of the dark matter , and the corresponding phenomenology is discussed in @xcite . as we have noted , we added the effects of the right - handed scalar neutrinos in our theory when calculating the dark matter relic density .",
    "generally , the possibility to discover a right - handed neutrino directly on a collider is significantly suppressed due to the rather small yukawa coupling @xmath24 in the case of tev see - saw mechanism , unless other physical sectors beyond the standard model which appear to interact with right - handed neutrinos exist@xcite . in the circumstances of nmssm , the interaction between the right - handed neutrino and the singlet higgs ( characterized by the magnitude of @xmath24 and @xmath26 ) can be relatively large .",
    "if we are able to observe the singlet higgs directly in the future , we can take a glimpse of right - handed neutrinos by watching the properties of the singlet , e.g. an invisible decay chain in the case that the right - handed ( s)neutrino is lighter than the singlet higgs , or its correction to the propagator when it is heavier .",
    "in this article , we have shown that nmssm with a @xmath7 symmetry extended with only one right - handed neutrino superfield can generate a complete spectrum of three massive light majorana left - handed neutrinos .",
    "the tree - level see - saw mechanism can only generate one massive neutrino , with the remaining two acquiring masses from radiative one - loop corrections .",
    "to accumulate the loop effects in order it can be comparable with the tree - level in quantity , we need relatively large @xmath111 , however other phenomenological effects from them are suppressed by the yukawa @xmath112 .",
    "though off - diagonal terms are needed in the soft mass - square terms of the sleptons , we are still able to acquire the correct neutrino mass differences without conflicting with the phenomenology constraints .",
    "we also showed that once the correct mass - difference is acquired , any figure of mixing angles is allowed , and of course so is the one measured by experiments .",
    "we also confirmed that the right - handed neutrino can contribute to higgs mass by its coupling with the higgs sectors .",

    "all of them are input into the microomegas@xcite model files inside the nmssmtools , and most of the vertices will also be used when calculating the higgs mass . because @xmath46 is assigned with the odd r - parity , @xmath46 rather than fermionic @xmath8 is set as the candidate of the dark matter .",
    "one may ask the question that whether right - handed neutrinos can play the role of dark matter if they decay slowly enough . according to @xcite@xcite , right - handed neutrinos",
