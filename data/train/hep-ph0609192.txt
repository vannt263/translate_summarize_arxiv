    "recent observations  @xcite give ground to believe that some astrophysical objects ( sgr and axp ) are magnetars , a distinct class of isolated neutron stars with magnetic field strength of @xmath1 g  @xcite , i.e. @xmath2 , where @xmath3  g  , @xmath4 is the electron mass , @xmath5 is the elementary charge . ] is the critical magnetic field .",
    "the spectra analysis of these objects is also providing evidence for the presence of electron - positron plasma in magnetar environment .",
    "it is well - known that strong magnetic field and/or plasma could influence essentially on different quantum processes  @xcite .",
    "therefore the effect of magnetized plasma on microscopic physics should be incorporated in the magnetosphere models of strongly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "the various studies indicate that electromagnetic processes such as compton scattering and photon splitting @xmath6 ( merging @xmath7 ) could play a crucial role in these models .",
    "for example , the process of photon splitting in strong magnetic field could suppress the production of electron - positron pair required for a detectable radio emission from magnetar  @xcite . in turn",
    ", compton scattering may play an important role in the models of atmosphere emission from strongly magnetized neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the both processes are very important in the models the radiation emission from sgr burst  @xcite .",
    "previously , compton scattering was studied under various conditions .",
    "the case of the magnetic field without plasma was investigated in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that compton scattering becomes strongly anisotropic and essentially depends on photon polarization . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the dispersion properties of photon in strongly magnetized cold plasma could significantly influence on the process under consideration .    in the present work the process of photon scattering , @xmath8 ,",
    "is investigated in the presence of strong magnetic field and charge - symmetric electron positron plasma , when the magnetic field strength @xmath9 is the maximal physical parameter , namely @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the plasma temperature , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the initial photon and electron energies . in this case",
    "almost all electrons and positrons in plasma are on the ground landau level .",
    "we also consider the none resonance case , when electron and photon momenta satisfy the condition @xmath14 .",
    "such conditions could be realized e.g. in the thompson & duncan model of sgr burst  @xcite in which magnetically trapped high temperature ( @xmath15 mev ) plasma fireball could be created .",
    "the main purposes of our work are :    * to investigate the influence of the strongly magnetized hot plasma on the process of compton scattering taking account of photon dispersion and wave function renormalization ; * to compare the compton scattering with the process of photon splitting ; * to estimate the possible effect of the process under consideration on spectral formation of sgr .",
    "the plan of the paper is following . in the section 2 we consider the propagation of the electromagnetic radiation in magnetized medium and",
    "give the expression of compton scattering amplitudes for different polarization configurations of the initial and final photons .",
    "the analytic and numerical calculations of the photon absorption rate and cross section of the process are presented in section 3 .",
    "the discussion of the possible astrophysical application of compton scattering are given in section 4 .",
    "the propagation of the electromagnetic radiation in any active medium is convenient to describe in terms of normal modes ( eigenmodes ) . in turn , the polarization and dispersion properties of normal modes are connected with eigenvectors and eigenvalues of polarization operator correspondingly . in the case of strongly magnetized charge - symmetric plasma",
    "the eigenvalues of the polarization operator can be obtained from the results of  @xcite :    @xmath16 { \\cal p}^{(2)}(q ) & \\simeq & -\\frac{2 eb \\alpha}{\\pi}\\left [ h\\left(\\frac{q^2_{\\mprl}}{4m^2 } \\right ) + { \\cal j}({q_{\\mbox{\\tiny $ \\|$ } } } ) \\right ] - q^2 \\ , \\lambda(b ) , \\label{p2 } \\\\[2 mm ] \\p^{(3)}(q ) & \\simeq &   - \\ , q^2 \\ , \\lambda(b ) , \\label{p3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17.\\ ] ] ( q _ ) = 4 q_^2 m^2 , e = , @xmath18^{-1}$ ] is the electron distribution function , h(z)= - 1 ,  z 1 .",
    "the four - vectors with indices @xmath19 and @xmath20 belong to the euclidean \\{1 , 2}-subspace and the minkowski \\{0 , 3}-subspace correspondingly in the frame were the magnetic field is directed along third axis ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the dimensionless field tensor and dual field tensor correspondingly .",
    "the tensors @xmath23 , @xmath24 , with equation @xmath25 are introduced .",
    "the dispersion properties of the normal modes are defined from the dispersion equations q^2 - ^()(q ) = 0 (= 1 , 2 , 3 ) .",
    "[ disper ] their analysis shows that the modes with @xmath26 and with polarization vectors _",
    "^(1)(q ) = , _",
    "^(2)(q ) = .",
    "[ epsilon ] are only physical in the case under consideration , just as in the pure magnetic field   and @xmath27 polarizations in pure magnetic field  @xcite and @xmath13- and @xmath28- modes in magnetized plasma  @xcite . ] .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the coincidence of the polarization vectors in the plasma is approximate , to within @xmath29 .",
    "notice , that in plasma only the eigenvalue @xmath30 modifies in comparison with pure magnetic field case .",
    "it means that the dispersion law of the mode 1 is the same one as in the magnetized vacuum , where its deviation from the vacuum law , @xmath31 , is negligibly small . from the other hand ,",
    "the dispersion properties of the mode 2 essentially differs from the magnetized vacuum ones . in the figure  [ fig : dis1 ]",
    "the photon dispersion in both strong magnetic field and magnetized plasma at various temperatures are depicted .",
    "one can see that in the presence of the magnetized plasma there exist the kinematical region , where @xmath32 contrary to the case of pure magnetic field .",
    "this fact could lead to the alteration of the different photon processes kinematic .",
    "for example , the photon splitting channel @xmath33 forbidden in the magnetic field without plasma becomes allowed  @xcite .",
    "another important distinction is an essentially different dependence of the dispersion law in variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 on the angle between the photon momentum and the magnetic field direction ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dis2 ] ) .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) that the eigenvalue of the polarization operator @xmath36 becomes large near the electron- positron pair production threshold , @xmath37 .",
    "this suggests that the renormalization of the wave function for a photon of this polarization should be taken into account : _",
    "^(2)(q ) , z^-1_2 = 1 - .",
    "[ eps ]    to calculate the amplitude of process in strong magnetic field one should use the dirac equation solutions at the ground landau level . for the electron propagator it is relevant to use its asymptotic form  @xcite . then substituting the polarization vectors  ( [ epsilon ] )",
    "one can obtain partial amplitudes for different polarization configuration of the initial and final photons .",
    "it is possible to present them in the covariant form : @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we can see from last equations that all amplitudes except @xmath44 are suppressed by magnetic field strength .",
    "therefore one could expect that mode 2 has the largest scattering absorption rate .",
    "to analyse the efficiency of the process under consideration and to compare it with other competitive reactions we calculate the photon absorption rate which can be defined in the following way : @xmath45 where @xmath46^{-1}$ ] is the photon distribution function . in the case of the rarefied plasma ( @xmath47 ) these absorption rates",
    "can be expressed in term of partial cross sections   @xmath48 : @xmath49 , \\label{eq : sigma11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50 , \\label{eq : sigma21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51 @xmath52 , \\label{eq : sigma22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the thompson cross section , @xmath54 is the parameter characterizing magnetic field influence , @xmath55 and the number of electron ( positron ) density in a strongly magnetized , charge - symmetric rarefied plasma can be estimated as @xmath56 in the low energy limit ( @xmath57 ) the formulas ( [ eq : sigma11]-[eq : sigma22 ] ) can be presented in the following form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is plasma frequency defined by equation @xmath60 = 0 .",
    "one can see that the presence of magnetized plasma slightly influences on the process cross - sections in this limit . moreover , the corrections connected with photon dispersion and wave function renormalization are significant only for @xmath61 , i.e. when magnetic field is rather strong @xmath62 . in the case",
    "@xmath63 which is relevant for the models of magnetar magnetosphere emission the formulas ( [ eq : sigma1st ] , [ eq : sigma2st ] ) coincide with the well - known result  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting also to consider the case of @xmath64 . in this region",
    "the magnetized vacuum influence is large and the cross - sections ( [ eq : sigma11]-[eq : sigma22 ] ) have the form : @xmath65 ,   \\quad \\sigma_{1 \\to 2 } = 4\\ , \\sigma_t   \\left ( \\frac{b_e}{b }",

    "we have made the numerical calculations of photon absorption rates for the various channels .",
    "the results are represented in figures [ fig : w22 ] and [ fig : w11 ] .",
    "in the models of soft gamma repeaters spectrum formation the dependence of photon absorption rates on energy and temperature plays an important role . it could influence on the shape of emergent spectrum and defines the temperature profile in the emission region during bursts in sgrs  @xcite . in the both figures [ fig : w22 ] and [ fig : w11 ]",
    "one can see that photon absorption rates corresponding to compton scattering are the fast increasing functions of temperature . at the same time",
    ", the channels with initial photon of mode 1 and mode 2 have different character of the absorption coefficient energy dependence . as shown in the fig.[fig : w22 ] the absorption rates for the reactions @xmath67 and @xmath68 have thresholds .",
    "they are caused by mode 2 dispersion relation with plasma frequency and indicated the fact that the electromagnetic wave corresponding to mode 2 ca nt propagate with energy below @xmath59 . in the region above plasma frequency @xmath69 is slightly depends on energy while @xmath70 tends to zero in the vicinity of @xmath59 and pair creation threshold , @xmath71 .",
    "we would like to note that in the vicinity of pair creation threshold taking account of wave function renormalization and photon dispersion becomes very important and defines the processes rates dependence on energy , temperature and magnetic field . in the region",
    "@xmath72 the photon of mode 2 is unstable due to the process @xmath73 with rate much lager than compton scattering .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath74 and @xmath75 is depicted in fig.[fig : w11 ] .",
    "on can see the fast increasing of absorption coefficients at low energies and rather slow dependence at @xmath76 .    the previous investigation of radiation transfer problem in strongly magnetized plasma have shown that along with compton scattering process the photon splitting @xmath6 could play a significant role as mechanism of photon production  @xcite . to compare these processes we depict the probabilities of the photon splitting channels on the same plots ( see dotted and chain lines in fig.[fig : w22 ] and fig.[fig : w11 ] ) .",
    "on can see that at temperature @xmath66 and in kinematical region @xmath77 the main photon splitting process is @xmath78 forbidden in pure magnetic field  @xcite . it is seen also that the rate of the process is much less than compton scattering ones .",
    "nevertheless , it could be an effective photon production mechanism at temperatures under consideration .",
    "the probabilities of the channels @xmath79 and @xmath80 increase with temperature falling and become comparable and even larger than compton scattering rates @xmath74 and @xmath75 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w11 ] the process of photon splitting strongly dominates over compton scattering at @xmath81 .",
    "it was claimed previously that the effect of the cold strongly magnetized plasma on photon splitting is not pronounced and the vacuum approximation can be used in the most calculations  @xcite .",
    "we can see now that in the presence of hot plasma the process of photon splitting could not be only intensive source of photon production but also an effective absorption mechanism .",
    "let us illustrate this fact in the framework of the magnetar model of sgr burst .",
    "it is known that the radiation transfer in the magnetically trapped plasma may be described as s diffusion of the 1-mode photons whereas 2-mode photons are locked  @xcite .",
    "the last circumstance is connected especially with weak dependence of the 2-mode absorption coefficient on photon energy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : w22 ] ) . in the assumption that the properties of the radiation field do not change much over absorption length @xmath82",
    "the radiation transfer may be conveniently described in terms of the rosseland mean free path of 1-mode photons  @xcite @xmath83^{-2 } d",
    "\\omega}{\\int \\omega^4 \\exp(\\omega / t ) [ \\exp(\\omega / t)-1]^{-2 } d \\omega } , \\label{eq : lr}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the total absorption coefficient .",
    "then the temperature distribution in the magnetically trapped plasma region could be defined from the diffusion equation : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath87 is the radiation flux .",
    "if only compton scattering process is considered then @xmath88 to take into account the effect of photon splitting one should add term @xmath89 to the equation ( [ eq : wcompt ] ) . in the figure  [ fig : rc_csp ] the ratio of the rosseland mean free path for only compton scattering to rosseland mean free path with photon splitting is depicted .",
    "one can see that at low temperatures the additional absorption process of photon splitting leads to the significant decreasing of the rosseland mean free path .",
    "the solution of the diffusion equation ( [ eq : difuss ] ) is out of the scope of this article .",
    "however , we would like to note that the more detail analysis of the radiation transfer needs the consistent solution of boltzmann equation for the photon occupation number and radiative transfer equation in the wide range of temperatures ( @xmath90 ) .        in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the influence of the strongly magnetized hot plasma on the compton scattering process with taking into account of photon dispersion and large radiative corrections .",
    "it was found that absorption rate of the dominant scattering channel of the 2-mode photon weakly depends on energy in wide temperature range whereas the 1-mode absorption coefficient is fast increasing function of photon energy .",
    "the comparison of the photon splitting effect and compton scattering shows that the influences of these reaction on the 1-mode radiation transfer are competitive in rarefied plasma @xmath91 .",
