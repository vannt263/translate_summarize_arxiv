    "the last decade has seen the discovery and characterization of an unexpectedly tight correlation between the mass of supermassive black holes ( smbh ; @xmath6 ) and the mass ( @xmath7 ) or velocity dispersion of their host galaxy s bulge @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass appears to be most strongly correlated with the bulge mass , not the total mass @xcite ; the scatter in this relation between bulge mass and black hole mass is estimated to be less than a factor of two @xcite .",
    "this relationship indicates that galaxy and black hole formation and evolution are interconnected .",
    "relation essentially through the central limit theorem , found that more than 10 generations of major mergers would be required to imprint a tight @xmath8 relation in a population that was initially uncorrelated .",
    "such a large number of major mergers is highly unlikely , arguing that while mergers may tighten this relation much of the correlation must be imprinted through a strong interconnection between @xmath7 and @xmath9 . ] in its weak form , such an interconnection could result if the black hole growth is limited by the wider galaxy environment ( ` dog wagging the tail ' ) .",
    "stronger forms of interconnection are also possible .",
    "the energy released by a growing smbh is sufficient , if it couples effectively with its surroundings , to have dramatic consequences on the galaxy ( ` tail wagging the dog ' ) .",
    "for example , the injection of energy into hot halo gas in galaxy clusters is indicated by the inflation of bubbles and the propagation of sound waves @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that smbhs with high accretion rates drive powerful outflows that remove ( at least some ) cold gas from galaxies @xcite .",
    "in fact , feedback from an accreting smbh / agn may help address many of the most difficult issues affecting models of galaxy evolution in a cosmological contest : e.g. , overcooling in massive halos and late star formation in elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "a diversity of models has been constructed to explore the interrelationship between bulge mass and black hole mass , featuring both weak and strong aspects of the possible interconnections ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , the details of the physical processes governing bh formation and growth , and the physical mechanisms whereby smbhs couple with their host galaxies and surroundings remain poorly understood",
    ". it will be impossible to model the full range of interconnected processes from theoretical first principles for some time , as the physics of the formation of smbhs and galaxy evolution spans at least @xmath10 7 orders of magnitude in scale .",
    "empirical and phenomenological constraints are therefore extremely important .",
    "a common feature of most `` unified '' models of smbh and galaxy formation is the concept of co - evolution , whereby the smbhs and their galaxies evolve under each other s influence .",
    "the term co - evolution means many things to many people ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the purpose of having strawmen to take aim at",
    ", we outline three possible scenarios :    * * strong co - evolution : * in its strongest sense ,",
    "co - evolution implies that bulges and black holes grow _ together _ , i.e. , in the same objects and at the same time . in this case",
    ", bh growth could be thought of as a sort of a ` tax ' : whenever star formation occurs , the smbh accretes some fraction of the mass involved .",
    "this scenario in its simplest form can already be ruled out  there are many examples of star - forming bulges without agn activity and bulges with agn activity and no sf ( e.g. , m87 ) . * * time offset : * one could imagine a scenario in which bulge stars and smbhs are formed in the same event , but on different timescales and/or stages of the event .",
    "for example , star formation might occur predominantly in the early stages of a merger , while bh growth might occur in the later stages ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such a picture would predict little evolution in the bh - bulge mass correlation for an unbiased ensemble , but galaxies in the throes of their bulge building events ( or black holes in their most rapid growth phase ) could exhibit significant deviations from the scaling relations ; this hypothesis is considerably more challenging to rule out . *",
    "* regulated growth : * a third possibility is that the major episodes of sf and bh accretion occur in different events , but the growth of one component regulates that of the other .",
    "for example , if black hole growth is regulated by feedback from the agn itself , as suggested by many workers ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the potential well of the pre - existing bulge determines how much energy is needed to stop further accretion and halt the growth of the black hole , and hence the final black hole mass .",
    "it is possible , even likely , that the bulge stars that dominate this potential well are formed mostly in previous star formation `` events '' , i.e. in progenitor disks which have subsequently merged . in this picture",
    ", one would expect a larger possible disconnect between observable episodes of sf vs. bh accretion _",
    ", even while the endpoints of this activity ( bulges and black holes ) are expected to end up being tightly related .",
    "there are a number of ways to attack the problem of co - evolution observationally .",
    "obviously , measuring the bh - bulge mass correlation at the present day at extremely low or high mass will provide powerful insights into the processes linking galaxy and smbh evolution @xcite .",
    "the study of the bh - bulge mass correlation during bh or bulge - building events is also an important avenue of approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most commonly - used technique in the latter approach is studying the masses of actively - accreting type i agn for which bh masses can be estimated using an empirically - calibrated combination of luminosity and broad line region line width ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; current results are controversial but tentatively support larger bh to bulge mass ratios at early times than those seen today ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also , e.g. , @xcite for the smaller ratios of black hole to bulge mass in rapidly - star - forming galaxies detected in the submm ) . with current generations of wide and deep cosmological surveys ,",
    "another means has opened up : comparison of evolution of the bh accretion rate ( bhar ) and that of the sfr of galaxies ( @xcite ; see @xcite and * ? ? ?",
    "* for early efforts ) .",
    "the history of bh accretion has been explored using primarily optical and x - ray techniques , with important insights being gained from observations in the radio and infrared @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a decade of intensive multi - wavelength and redshift surveying has placed powerful and interesting constraints on the volume - averaged sf history of the universe @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the integrated bh accretion and sf histories give values that match to within a factor of 2 or 3 of the present - day bh mass and stellar mass densities @xcite ; we will discuss in detail uncertainties and possible inconsistencies between the integral of the sfr and the present - day stellar mass in ",
    "[ sec : overall ] .",
    "the observational maturity of current datasets at @xmath11 allows the use of a novel angle of attack on the problem of co - evolution .",
    "recent multi - wavelength / hst surveys have covered enough volume that sfr density and bhar density can be estimated in well - defined subsamples of galaxies for the first time , offering potentially decisive insight into not only the statistical evolution of these quantities , but into whether black holes and bulges are actually growing _ in the same objects and at the same time_. this is the approach we will adopt in this paper . to do this ,",
    "we first examine the global sfr and bhar (  [ sec : overall ] ) , then the multiplicity functions of sfr and bhar as a function of redshift (  [ sec : multifuncs ] ) . in  [ sec : host ] , we present new measurements of sf activity in mass and morphology - limited samples of galaxies , and examine accretion activity driven by massive bhs in massive spheroids under assumptions widely used in literature . in  [ sec : summ ] , we discuss the results in the context of co - evolution and summarize our conclusions . throughout the paper we assume a cosmology with h@xmath12=70kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14=0.3 and @xmath15=0.7 .",
    "we first attempt to give some context to the analysis that will follow by exploring the cosmic star formation and black hole accretion histories .           during the last decade ,",
    "a number of studies have contributed to determining the average sfr per co - moving volume at different cosmic epochs with various sfr estimators ( e.g. , uv , h@xmath16 , ir and radio ) .",
    "the available measurements from the literature compiled by @xcite , and complemented with recent measurements from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are shown in figure  [ sfr ] .",
    "we include also recent estimates from the use of uv and 24 data to account for both unobscured and obscured star formation at @xmath11 @xcite . here",
    "all measurements are corrected to our adopted cosmology and a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "it can be seen from figure  [ sfr ] that the cosmic sfr density increases rapidly with redshift , peaks at @xmath17 , then becomes flat or declines at @xmath18 , although the uncertainties are large at these early epochs .",
    "the cosmic sfr density decreases by an order of magnitude from the @xmath1 to the present day , following @xmath19 .",
    "a complementary measurement to the cosmic sfr density is the cosmic stellar mass density .",
    "the assembly of stellar mass should be consistent with the integral of the cosmic sfr density .",
    "current measurements show a reasonably good agreement between the two , at least at redshifts less than about unity @xcite ; about 40 - 50% of local stars were formed since @xmath1 @xcite . as an aside",
    ", it is worth noting that there is a possible mismatch between the integral of the cosmic sfr density at @xmath20 with the stellar mass observed to be in place at @xmath1 : it appears that the integral is a factor of @xmath21 in excess of the stellar mass formed by @xmath1 .",
    "the origin of this mismatch is currently not well - understood .",
    "it is possible that this discrepancy signals a break - down in the utility of sfr indicators or a change or break - down of a universally - applicable stellar imf .",
    "it should also be noted that at @xmath20 the estimates of sfr ( and stellar mass ) are highly uncertain ; in particular , the relatively sensitive uv measurements need to be corrected for substantial ( factors of a few ) dust extinction using defensible but uncertain recipes @xcite , and measurements of the rest - frame ir and radio probe only the most luminous systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite for substantial progress towards this goal using stacking of radio data ; it is interesting that their resulting sfr densities are much lower than those reported previously at @xmath22 ) . yet , for our purposes , the possibility of a mismatch between sfr and stellar mass at @xmath20 is of relatively little importance ; the focus of our work is at the better - constrained @xmath11 redshift range .      observed ( optically `` bright '' ) bh accretion apparently can account for nearly all of the bh mass seen in remnants today , indicating that the bulk of bh mass growth occurs during a luminous agn phase with a radiation efficiency @xmath23 @xmath24 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we caution that compton - thick agn are not counted in the hrh07 bolometric lfs .",
    "correction for the missing accretion is suggested to be @xmath26dex ( a factor of 1.4 ; see hrh07 for more discussion ) .",
    "hrh07 presented several evolution models which fit the agn bolometric luminosity function at different cosmic epochs .",
    "we adopted the best - fit pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model and the luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model of the bolometric lf @xmath27 from hrh07 to calculate the bhar per co - moving volume as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bolometric luminosity and we have adopted @xmath30 . by default @xmath29 is given in units of @xmath31 .",

    "the cosmic bhar density peaks at @xmath33 , and dramatically decreases to the present day . at @xmath34 , the cosmic bhar density is likely to decline or stay flat to earlier cosmic times although the uncertainties are large ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "figure  [ sfr ] shows the cosmic sfr density to be in good agreement with the cosmic bhar density scaled by a factor of 2000 over a wide redshift range from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "the factor 2000 is the ratio of the integral of the cosmic sfr density to the integral of the cosmic bhar density within the redshift range from @xmath40 to @xmath1 , where both quantities are well determined . in the redshift range",
    "@xmath41 a quantitative comparison between the cosmic sfr density and bhar density can be made : they increase with redshift with almost the same slope of @xmath42 ( 1+z)@xmath43 within the errors .",
    "figure  [ sfr ] suggests that the cosmic bh accretion history is parallel to the cosmic sf history .",
    "if the strong co - evolution hypothesis is correct , the shift between the volume - averaged sfr and volume - averaged bhar ( a factor of 2000 ; 3.3dex ) should be consistent with the difference between the local stellar mass density and bh mass density .",
    "the integral of the sfr needs to be corrected for the recycling of mass back into gas during the process of stellar evolution ; with our adopted imf , almost 50% of the initially - formed stellar mass is returned to the ism within 57gyr .",
    "thus , one expects a ratio of local stellar mass density to bh mass density of @xmath44 .",

    "we have shown in  [ comsfrbh ] that the cosmic bh accretion history tracks the cosmic sf history through a universal scaling factor of 2000 . comparing the bhar function with the sfr function , we find that the former always tracks the latter in all four redshift slices from @xmath48 to @xmath1 after being re - scaled by a factor of 20 in bhar and by 100 in number density , as shown in figure  [ sfrfuncs ] . the two scaling factors 20 and 100 are empirically determined to make the agreement between the two functions as good as possible , particularly in the wide regime around the sfr function `` knee '' ( i.e. , 0@xmath542 ) , where the vast majority of the total sf occurs .",
    "we split sf events by their intensity into three classes : high - intensity ( @xmath55@xmath56 ; i.e. , ultraluminous ir galaxies ) , medium - intensity ( @xmath57@xmath56 ; i.e. , luminous ir galaxies ) and low - intensity ( @xmath58@xmath56 ; i.e. , `` normal '' galaxies ) .",

    "the results are shown in figure  [ sfrbhar ] .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ sfrbhar ] , the volume - averaged sfr / bhar contained in high - intensity star formation or bh accretion events decreases dramatically from @xmath1 to @xmath48 , whereas the decrease of the volume - averaged sfr / bhar with decreasing redshift is gradually slower for the medium - intensity and low - intensity sf and bh accretion events .",
    "the low - intensity sf and bh accretion events dominate the cosmic sfr / bhar at low-@xmath61 and the high - intensity star formation / bh accretion events start to dominate the cosmic sfr / bhar at @xmath62 .",
    "it is clear that for either the medium - intensity or the low - intensity class , the volume - averaged sfr matches the volume - averaged bhar remarkably well over the redshift range @xmath63 .",
    "for the high - intensity class , the agreement is poor , possibly because of the large uncertainties in the sfr and bhar functions in this range ( @xmath55@xmath56 or @xmath64@xmath56 ) .",
    "we conclude that sf events statistically track bh accretion events over @xmath63 when split by intensity .",
    "in  2 and  3 , we presented evidence that both the distribution ( multiplicity functions ) and integrals of the sf rate and supermassive black hole accretion rate evolve similarly at all redshifts , with an offset in integrated rate of a factor of @xmath65 at all @xmath66 .",
    "taken at face value , such a coincidence may lead one to predict a correlation between galaxy mass and supermassive black hole mass , offset by a factor of @xmath44 in zero point ( where the expected offset is a factor of 1000 rather than 2000 because of the recycling of stellar mass during the course of stellar evolution ) .",

    "there are both observational claims and theoretical expectations that the relationship between bh mass and spheroid mass might have been larger in the past .",
    "while this evolution would impact our calculation by shifting the mass of the bh ( and therefore the cutoff luminosity for agn ) to include in our `` matched '' bhar , this would only cause a minor change in the slope of the bhar and can not remove the mismatch between sf and bha in spheroid dominated galaxies .",
    "therefore , this would not change any of our conclusions .",
    "there are two possible ways to reconcile this apparent paradox .",
    "one possibility ( which shall now call merger scenario 1 ) is that bulges and bh grow in proportion to one another , and in the same _ events _ , but with an offset in time .",
    "for example , in simulations of galaxy - galaxy mergers including bh growth , the luminous agn phase is delayed by about a dynamical time ( a few hundred myr ) relative to the peak of the starburst activity @xcite . in this picture",
    ", we would expect that most agn hosts would resemble late - stage mergers , i.e. objects with spheroidal morphology but young stellar populations , in plausible agreement with our observational results . moreover , in this picture , we would expect that a small fraction of agn to be detected in early stage mergers , and the star formation associated with this bh growth should be observed in early - stage mergers , i.e. close pairs or highly morphologically disturbed objects .",
    "however , other studies have found that only a small fraction of the global star formation at @xmath11 is occurring in galaxy mergers @xcite : the strongest limit is set by robaina et al . , who find that @xmath410% of the star formation in massive galaxies ( @xmath162 ) is directly triggered by _ all identifiable phases _ ( from close pairs to morphologically disturbed remnants ) of major galaxy merging .",
    "this is strong evidence against the merger scenario 1 .",
    "therefore , while a small fraction of the star formation associated with the bh growth that we witness at @xmath163 may be occurring in the same merger events that feed the bh , it seems that this does not represent the majority of the sf activity needed to `` match '' the observed bh accretion .",
    "the second possibility ( merger scenario 2 ) is that most star formation takes place in isolated disks .",
    "when these disks merge , the pre - existing stars are scrambled into a dynamically hot spheroidal remnant .",
    "the presence of even a modest amount of gas leads to the formation of a remnant with higher phase - space density and hence a deeper gravitational potential well @xcite .",
    "if the depth of the potential well in the central parts of the galaxy determines how large the bh can grow , as in the picture of self - regulated bh growth outlined by @xcite , then the post - merger bh will end up on the bh mass - bulge mass relation , _ despite the fact that the sfr and bhar during the merger event may not necessarily obey the universal proportionality factor_.    one can easily see that in this scenario , in many cases the bh accretion and the star formation will not trace each other during the merger event . for example , in a major merger of two pure disk progenitors , the scaled bhar will be larger than the sfr associated with bulge growth .",
    "most of the bulge mass will be contributed by the pre - existing stars in the progenitor disks , and the bh will grow to `` catch up '' with the bulge . in the opposite extreme , in a merger of two galaxies with pre - existing massive bh , there may be very little bh accretion because the agn will almost immediately `` shut itself off '' . in this case",
    ", the sf in the merger might be larger than the scaled bh accretion ( if the progenitors contain enough gas ) .    because what we see is more bh accretion than we would expect based on the amount of star formation in spheroids ,",
    "we conclude that most of the mass in these spheroids was contributed by the pre - existing stars in the progenitors rather than by new stars formed in the merger - associated bursts .",
    "indeed , we have independent lines of evidence that this must be the case . we know that the colors of elliptical galaxies and bulges at @xmath163 are characteristic of fairly old stellar populations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and similarly , fossil evidence from line strengths in nearby ellipticals also precludes the very recent formation of a large fraction of the stellar mass @xcite . in addition , this picture is consistent with the relatively small fraction of star formation associated with ongoing mergers at @xmath11 : in cosmological models that incorporate a scenario like merger scenario 2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the predicted fraction of star formation triggered by major mergers at @xmath11 is about 7% , in excellent agreement with the observational estimates ( see robaina et al .",
    "2009 for details of the comparison ) .    a slightly modified version of merger scenario 2 can also be accommodated in a universe in which the bh - spheroid mass ratio has decreased with time .",
    "this is in fact expected in the theoretical picture that has emerged from the analysis of hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers with self - regulated bh growth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies find that the final bh - spheroid mass ratio depends on the gas fraction of the progenitors .",
    "this is because gas - rich progenitors can dissipate energy during the merger , and all else equal , form more compact remnants than gas - poor mergers @xcite . in this deep potential",
    "well , the bh can grow to a larger mass ( relative to the spheroid ) before the pressure - driven outflow halts further accretion .",
    "if gas fractions in merging galaxies were higher at high redshift , as is generally expected , this would then lead to the prediction that bh were more massive relative to their spheroids at high redshift . a significant fraction of mergers at @xmath11",
    "are expected to involve at least one galaxy that already contains a massive bh .",
    "if the pre - existing bh is already larger than the `` critical mass '' set by the new remnant , further bh growth will be stifled .",
    "theoretical models predict that this expected evolution is relatively mild : less than a factor of two since @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that the stellar mass in red ( predominantly spheroidal ) galaxies has increased by a factor of 23 since @xmath164 , while the stellar mass in blue ( disk - dominated ) galaxies has remained about the same over this time period .",
    "at the same time , we know that the bulk of new star formation is occurring in blue ( disk - dominated ) galaxies , implying that mass in blue ( disk ) galaxies must be transformed into red ( spheroidal ) galaxies at approximately the same rate that new stars are forming @xcite . given that most of the red galaxies are spheroid - dominated , which is well established at least at @xmath11 @xcite ,",
    "the mass on the red sequence can not grow simply via the quenching of star formation in disks  a strong dynamical process like merging is required .",
    "taken together , this evidence strongly favors a picture in which , at least at @xmath11 , the bulk of the growth of mass in spheroids is due to merging of pre - existing , already old disk stars , and bhs preferentially grow to `` catch up '' to their newly assembled bulges following a merger event . in this case",
    ", the parallel evolution of the global sfr and bhar may simply reflect the apparent coincidence that , at @xmath11 , the rate of formation of new stars is approximately equal to the rate that stellar mass is transferred from disks into bulges via mergers .",

    "<S> we use 903 galaxies from the combo-17 survey with m@xmath2m@xmath3 , ultraviolet and infrared - derived sfrs from spitzer and galex , and morphologies from gems hst / acs imaging . using stacking techniques , we find that @xmath425% of all sf occurs in spheroid - dominated galaxies ( srsic index @xmath52.5 ) , while the bhar that we would expect if the global scalings held is three times higher . </S>",
    "<S> this rules out the simplest picture of co - evolution , in which sf and bha trace each other at all times . </S>",
    "<S> these results could be explained if sf and bha occur in the same events , but offset in time , for example at different stages of a merger event . </S>",
    "<S> however , one would then expect to see the corresponding star formation activity in early - stage mergers , in conflict with observations . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the major episodes of sf and bha occur in different events , with the bulk of sf happening in isolated disks and most bha occurring in major mergers . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent global co - evolution results from the regulation of the bh growth by the potential well of the galactic spheroid , which includes a major contribution from disrupted disk stars . </S>"
