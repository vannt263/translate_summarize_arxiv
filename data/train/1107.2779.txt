    "cosmic inflation is arguably the most compelling way to overcome , or at least ameliorate , the so - called horizon and flatness problems of the hot big bang cosmology .",
    "however , these problems are successfully addressed by all models of inflation , provided that the inflationary expansion lasts long enough .",
    "therefore , discrimination between inflation models is based on another important consequence of inflationary expansion , namely the generation of the curvature perturbation @xmath0 in the universe , which is responsible for the formation of structures such as galaxies and galactic clusters and which is reflected onto the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation through the sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "the latest cmb observations appear to confirm the `` vanilla '' predictions of inflation with respect to @xmath0 : scale - invariance , gaussianity and statistical homogeneity and isotropy",
    ". however , a period of accelerated expansion of space ( this is the definition of cosmic inflation ) is not enough to guarantee scale - invariance for the curvature perturbation .",
    "indeed , inflation is required to be of the quasi - de sitter type , where the density of the universe remains roughly constant . also , the cmb observations seem to suggest that exact scale - invariance is not favoured ( although it is not ruled out ) with the spectral index of @xmath0 , satisfying ( at 1@xmath1 ) @xcite when @xmath2cdm cosmology is assumed . most likely , this reveals some dynamics for inflation ( the density is not exactly constant ) , which is indeed expected by model - builders . similarly , a high degree of gaussianity in the curvature perturbation is expected since this reflects the randomness of quantum fluctuations , on which the particle production process is feeding , in order to generate the superhorizon spectrum of the fields which eventually give rise to @xmath0 . however , the gaussianity of @xmath0 crucially depends on the linearity of the process which translates these field perturbations to @xmath0 .",
    "this is quantified through the so - called non - linearity parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the latest cmb observations provide a hint of non - zero non - gaussianity since , in the squeezed configuration , ( at 1@xmath1 ) @xcite , which again appears to deviate from the `` vanilla '' prediction .",
    "is indeed predominantly gaussian because the bispectrum @xmath4 is related to the power spectrum @xmath5 roughly as ( see eq .",
    "( [ fnldef ] ) ) , with the observations suggesting for the spectrum @xcite . ]    in the same spirit , observations suggest that there may be deviations from statistical homogeneity , since there seem to be a difference in the power of @xmath0 as large as 10% between hemispheres in the cmb @xcite .",
    "finally , statistical isotropy in @xmath0 is also questioned by observations . indeed ,",
    "there is tantalising evidence of a preferred direction on the microwave sky .",
    "this is the so - called `` axis of evil '' observation @xcite , which amounts to an alignment of the quadrupole and octupole moments in the cmb , which is statistically extremely unlikely @xcite and has been shown to persist beyond foreground removal @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that the precision of the cosmological observations is such that begins to enable us to explore beyond the `` vanilla '' predictions of inflation and use the observed deviations from them to discriminate between classes of models and paradigms .",
    "there is already a huge literature on deviations from exact scale - invariance and gaussianity for the curvature perturbation . in this paper",
    "we discuss possible deviations from statistical isotropy and we present a compelling paradigm for their generation ; namely the vector curvaton paradigm .    throughout the paper we consider a metric with negative signature and use natural units where and newton s gravitational constant is , with being the reduced planck mass .",
    "statistical anisotropy amounts to direction dependent patterns in the cmb .",
    "it can be quantified as follows .",
    "the spectrum @xmath6 of the curvature perturbation is defined through the two - point correlator as @xmath7 where and @xmath8 the reality condition demands that .",

    "a similar parametrisation can be assigned to higher order correlators , i.e. the bispectrum , trispectrum etc .",

    "@xcite the latest cmb data was analysed without the prior of statistical isotropy , in order to obtain bounds or even detect statistical anisotropy .",
    "indeed , it was found that at the level of 9@xmath1!. however , the preferred direction was too close to the ecliptic plane so the authors suspected some unknown systematic .",
    "hence , this number can be considered only as an upper bound .",
    "the observations of the planck satellite will strengthen this bound by at least an order of magnitude and reduce it to if statistical anisotropy in the spectrum of the curvature perturbation is indeed not observed @xcite .",
    "statistical anisotropy in the curvature perturbation can not be generated if one considers the effects of scalar fields only , because the latter can not introduce a preferred direction . in this paper",
    "we will study how vector boson fields can directly influence the curvature perturbation and generate statistical anisotropy .",
    "can also be generated by considering a mild anisotropisation of the inflationary expansion , due to the presence of a vector boson field condensate . in this case , it is the perturbations of the inflaton scalar field which are rendered statistically anisotropic @xcite . ]",
    "we will investigate the contribution of vector fields to @xmath0 through the so - called @xmath14 formalism @xcite .    according the @xmath14 formalism",

    "the anisotropy parameter is @xmath28 where we have defined @xmath29 which quantifies the relative contribution of the vector over the scalar field to the modulation of @xmath16 .",
    "notice that particle production becomes isotropic ( ) if .",
    "statistical anisotropy is also possible to be manifest in higher order correlators of the curvature perturbation . in this paper",
    "we discuss only the bispectrum ( for the trispectrum see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the bispectrum of the curvature perturbation is defined as @xmath30 the bispectrum @xmath4 is a measure of the non - gaussianity of the curvature perturbation since , for gaussian @xmath0 , @xmath4 is exactly zero .",
    "the curvature perturbation is generated due to the quantum fluctuations of suitable fields which are stretched to become classical perturbations during inflation . since",
    "quantum fluctuations are gaussian ( which reflects their randomness ) sizable non - gaussianity in @xmath0 is generated only if the process through which the perturbations of the relevant fields affect the expansion of the universe and imprint their contribution to the curvature perturbation .",
    "if this process is significantly non - linear deviations from gaussianity will be generated .",

    "for a vector field to directly affect the curvature perturbation in the universe we need two ingredients .",
    "first , we need a mechanism to break the conformal invariance of the vector field and generate a superhorizon spectrum of vector field perturbations @xmath40 .",
    "second , we need a mechanism that will allow these perturbations to affect ( or even generate ) the curvature perturbation @xmath0 . this can be done only if the vector field and/or its perturbations , in some way affect the universe evolution .    in this section",
    "we focus on the second ingredient , i.e. on a mechanism for the generation of a contribution from the vector field perturbations to the curvature perturbation of the universe ; namely the vector curvaton mechanism .",
    "thus , we assume that some given mechanism has produced the necessary superhorizon spectrum of vector field perturbations ( as is discussed in sec .",
    "[ pp ] ) during inflation , which for the moment we take for granted .",
    "a single vector field can not play the role of the inflaton .",
    "the reason is straightforward .",
    "inflation homogenises a vector field and a homogeneous vector field picks up a preferred direction in space . thus ,",
    "if a homogeneous vector field dominated the universe during inflation it would lead to excessive anisotropic stress , which would produce too much of a large - scale anisotropy and , therefore , will be in conflict with cmb observations .",
    "a huge number @xmath41 of vector fields , randomly oriented , could avoid this problem @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if this is the case then the statistical anisotropy produced is , which means that hundreds of vector fields are needed to satisfy the observational bounds .",
    "this not only implies the use of giant gauge groups but also requires the tuning of the initial conditions so that they are the same for all the fields .",
    "another option is to consider a `` triad '' of orthogonally oriented vector fields ( again with the same initial conditions ) so that the excessive anisotropic stress is eliminated @xcite . for the above reasons we will not consider vector fields as inflatons .",
    "if the vector field is not the inflaton , it needs to affect the universe expansion in some other way , either at the end or after the end of inflation .",
    "there are a multitude of mechanisms which may allow a vector field to do that , mirroring the corresponding scalar field models .",
    "prominent examples include the curvaton @xcite , the inhomogeneous end of inflation @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the modulated reheating @xcite mechanisms . historically , statistical anisotropy by vector field perturbations was first studied in the context of the inhomogeneous end of inflation mechanism @xcite , using a particular model of hybrid inflation . here , however , we concentrate on the curvaton mechanism , which has the considerable advantage that it does not rely on an interaction of any kind between the vector field and the inflaton sectors .",
    "this avoids overcomplicating the model but , more importantly , allows the vector curvaton sector to be completely independent of the physics of inflation . as such , not only can it apply in many given inflation scenarios , but it can correspond to physics at a much lower energy scale than inflation ; even tev physics . as is the case of the scalar curvaton ,",
    "the vector curvaton is not a particular model but it can correspond to a multitude of realisations , hence we refer to the mechanism as a paradigm rather than a model .",
    "the vector curvaton mechanism was first introduced in the pioneering work in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was the first article to consider the possibility that a vector boson field can contribute to the curvature perturbation in the universe .",
    "the idea of the curvaton assumes the existence of a spectator field during inflation , which has nothing to do with inflationary dynamics but is light enough so that it manages to obtain a superhorizon spectrum of perturbations . after the end of inflation ( possibly long afterwards )",
    ", the curvaton becomes heavy and begins undergoing oscillations which allow it to come to dominate ( or nearly dominate ) the universe before its decay .",
    "owing to its perturbations , the density of the curvaton is perturbed throughout space so that its ( near ) domination occurs at different times at different locations .",
    "thus , its effect on the evolution of the universe is location dependent , which is the reason why it can affect ( or even generate ) the curvature perturbation in the universe .",
    "note that , for a vector field to do this , it must avoid generating an excessive anisotropic stress at domination .",
    "consider a massive abelian vector boson field , with lagrangian density @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the vector field , @xmath44 is its mass and is the field strength tensor .",
    "inflation homogenises the vector field so that . if it is easy to show that the temporal component of the homogeneous vector field is zero , i.e. .",
    "if then the field is gauge invariant and we can set by virtue of a gauge choice .",
    "however , in this case the value of the spatial vector field @xmath45 is not well defined because gauge invariance allows us to change it as , where @xmath46 is a constant vector of arbitrary magnitude .",
    "thus , we will concentrate on the case from now on , where gauge invariance is broken and the homogeneous `` zero - mode '' is well defined .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for the vector field is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the metric tensor ( negative signature is assumed ) .",
    "the above can be written as @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 with @xmath51 where ` kin ' denotes the kinetic density @xmath52 .",
    "notice that the energy - momentum tensor is similar to the one of a perfect fluid with the crucial difference that the pressure along the longitudinal direction is of opposite sign to the pressure along the transverse directions .",
    "this means that , if this pressure were not zero and the vector field dominated the universe , it would give rise to significant anisotropic stress , which is the reason why a single vector field can not play the role of the inflaton .    using eq .",
    "( [ l0 ] ) one can obtain the equation of motion for the homogeneous vector field , which reads @xmath53 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath54 and is the hubble parameter , i.e. the rate of the universe expansion . at this point",
    "we need to stress that is the _ comoving _ and not the physical vector field . indeed , the mass term in eq .",
    "( [ l0 ] ) can be written as @xmath55 where we used that and a spatially flat frw metric . from the above it",
    "can deduced that the _ physical _ vector field has spatial components @xmath56    in terms of the physical vector field , eq .  ( [ eomw ] )",
    "is written as @xmath57 where . from eqs .",
    "( [ rkinva ] ) and ( [ phys ] ) one finds @xmath58    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eomhom ] ) is of the form @xcite @xmath59 , \\label{solu}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the barotropic parameter of the universe , , @xmath61 are constants of integration and @xmath62 denotes bessel function of the the first kind with order @xmath63 .",
    "when the physical vector field is light the above solution can be approximated as @xcite @xmath64 where the subscript ` end ' denotes the end of inflation . from the above solution",
    "it can be shown that @xcite @xmath65 thus , when the vector field is light its energy density is dominated by its kinetic density .",
    "therefore , @xcite @xmath66 i.e. the light vector field scales as radiation with the universe expansion .",
    "when the physical vector field is heavy the solution in eq .",
    "( [ solu ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath67 , \\label{heavysolu}\\ ] ] which shows that the vector field is undergoing rapid quasi - harmonic oscillations whose envelope is decreasing as .",
    "this is easy to understand since , for a heavy vector field , within a hubble time one can ignore the friction term in eq .",
    "( [ eomhom ] ) and write it as . from eqs .",
    "( [ r+v ] ) and ( [ heavysolu ] ) it is straightforward to find @xmath68\\rightarrow\\rho_a\\propto a^{-3},\\ ] ] where we used in a spatially flat frw universe .",
    "thus , we see that the density of the heavy oscillating vector field scales as pressureless matter with the universe expansion .",
    "but is it pressureless indeed ? from eqs .",
    "( [ rkinp ] ) , ( [ r+v ] ) and ( [ heavysolu ] ) we readily obtain @xcite @xmath69 \\rightarrow\\overline{p_\\perp}=0\\,,\\hspace{-1cm}\\ ] ] i.e. over a hubble time ( which corresponds to a large number of oscillations ) the average transverse pressure is zero . since the longitudinal pressure is @xmath70 it is zero too .",
    "this means that the energy - momentum of the rapidly oscillating homogeneous vector field is that or pressureless _ isotropic _ matter ( cf .",
    "( [ tdiag ] ) ) .",
    "hence , the vector field can dominate the universe without introducing excessive anisotropic stress .",
    "one way of understanding this is that , due to the harmonic oscillations which send , the direction of the vector field is rapidly alternated , so that , over a hubble time , there is _ no net direction _ and the vector field behaves as an approximately isotropic fluid .",
    "( 200,280 ) ( -100,-500 )      we have seen that the density of a massive abelian vector field homogenised by inflation scales as radiation when the field is light and as matter when it becomes heavy . after the end of inflation the energy density is eventually transferred into a newly formed thermal bath of relativistic particles .",
    "the density of this thermal bath is dominated by radiation @xmath71 .",
    "the homogeneous vector field is initially light so its density also scales as radiation .",
    "therefore , the density parameter of our vector field remains constant , where is the density of the universe . during radiation domination",
    "the hubble parameter reduces with time as so that eventually the vector field becomes heavy and begins its coherent oscillations . from then on ,",
    "its density scales like matter and its density parameter grows .",
    "thus , the vector field has a chance to dominate ( or nearly dominate ) the universe before its decay . when it does so it imposes its own curvature perturbation onto the universe , according to the curvaton scenario @xcite , without introducing any anisotropic stress @xcite . a schematic representation of the vector curvaton scenario is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig ] .",
    "the superhorizon perturbations of the vector field satisfy the same equation of motion as eq .",
    "( [ eomhom ] ) .",
    "the reason is that this equation is linear and that the gradient term is heavily diluted for superhorizon perturbations . where @xmath72 is the physical momentum scale , which is for superhorizon perturbations .",
    "note that the mass of the vector field is much larger than @xmath73 , when it is oscillating and the same is true for its perturbations . ] hence , the perturbations follow the same behaviour as the homogeneous zero - mode ( with ) . thus ,",
    "when the vector field becomes heavy they undergo quasi - harmonic oscillations too and their anisotropic stress is also eliminated .",
    "the existence of these perturbations of the vector field implies that the density @xmath74 is also perturbed and the field s ( near ) domination of the universe occurs at slightly different times at different locations .",
    "this results in a difference ( perturbation ) in the timescale of the universe history , which , according to the @xmath14 philosophy , results in a contribution to the curvature perturbation @xmath0 .",
    "since the density @xmath74 is a scalar quantity , this is a _ scalar _ contribution to @xmath0 ( and not a vector contribution ) .",
    "let us now quantify the above .",
    "the curvature perturbation in the universe is , in principle , the sum of the contribution of the vector field @xmath75 and any preexisting curvature perturbation , already present in the radiation fluid @xmath76 .",
    "then we can write @xcite @xmath77 where and we have assumed that the vector field has already become heavy .",
    "in the above , @xmath78 corresponds to the curvature perturbation attributed to the @xmath79-th component of the universe content , which , on a spatially flat slice of spacetime , is given by @xcite @xmath80 where we used the continuity equation for independent fluids .",
    "the above suggest that the contribution of the heavy vector field to @xmath0 is @xmath81 at the onset of the oscillations so that . thus , to first order we find @xmath82 from eq .",
    "( [ dn ] ) we see that the contribution of the vector field to @xmath0 to first order is .",
    "comparing with the above we get @xmath83 thus , to second order , the contribution of the vector curvaton to the curvature perturbation is @xcite @xmath84 note , however , that for , the one - loop correction ( last term in the above ) is negligible .",
    "let us now turn our attention to non - gaussianity . with the above values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 and eqs .",

    "( [ zb ] ) ) and @xmath92 is the angle between @xmath91 and the shorter momentum vector in the squeezed configuration .    from eqs .",
    "( [ fnleql ] ) and ( [ fnlsqz ] ) it is evident that , in the vector curvaton scenario with parity invariance , one can write @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the anisotropy parameter for non - gaussianity . in analogy to @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ gdef ] ) , @xmath94 quantifies statistical anisotropy in the bispectrum of @xmath0 . if , then non - gaussianity is predominantly anisotropic , which means that @xmath3 should have a clear angular modulation on the sky .",
    "if non - gaussianity is indeed observed and no such modulation is found then models which predict will be ruled out .",
    "it is important to note above that the directions of statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and the bispectrum are correlated , since they are both determined by @xmath95 .",
    "this is a smoking gun for the contribution of vector fields to @xmath0 .",
    "the vector curvaton mechanism can affect ( or even generate ) the curvature perturbation provided the vector field has , somehow , obtained a superhorizon spectrum of perturbations during inflation . in order to do this",
    "we need to have a mechanism which breaks the conformal invariance of the vector field .",
    "a massless abelian vector field is conformally invariant , which means that it is not affected by the universe expansion ( it perceives it as a conformal transformation to which it is insensitive ) .",
    "hence , it does not undergo particle production during inflation .",
    "consequently , its quantum fluctuations do not give rise to classical perturbations of the field as is done , for example , with minimally coupled massless scalar fields .",
    "thus , one expects a light vector field to be approximately conformally invariant and the production of its perturbations to be suppressed .",
    "an explicit breakdown of the vector field conformality is , therefore , required .",
    "this is model dependent , which suggests that observations might be able to discern between models and provide insight on the underlying theory .    in this section",

    "the first step is to perturb the vector field around the homogeneous value as .",
    "then we fourier transform the perturbations as @xmath96 and find the equations of motion of the fourier components @xmath97@xmath98 for the given model .",
    "the next step is to promote the vector field perturbations to quantum operators by expanding in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xmath99.\\ ] ] the mode functions @xmath100 and the fourier components of the perturbations of the vector field satisfy the same equations of motion because the latter are linear .",
    "thus , we need to solve these equations and find the the mode functions . to do this",

    "we investigate if this vector field can play the role of the vector curvaton .",
    "this was first studied in ref .",

    ", particle production has been studied in ref .",
    "it was found that , the transverse components obtain a scale invariant superhorizon spectrum of perturbations when @xmath121 where the subscript ` * ' denotes the time of horizon exit . to obtain a scale - invariant spectrum for the longitudinal component one needs an additional condition on the time - dependence of @xmath122 , which reads @xcite @xmath123",
    "if the vector field is a gauge boson then @xmath124 is the gauge kinetic function which is related with the gauge coupling as .",
    "this means that only the case when is possible since , only then does the gauge field remain weakly coupled during inflation .",
    "the gauge kinetic function is one of the three fundamental functions  which define a supergravity theory . in supergravity ,",
    "the gauge kinetic function is a holomorphic function of the scalar fields of the theory .",
    "now , during inflation , supergravity corrections are expected to give masses @xmath125 to the scalar fields @xcite .",
    "this means that , during inflation , these scalar fields are fast - rolling down the slopes of the scalar potential , which would cause significant variation to the gauge kinetic function .",
    "indeed , it is easy to show that is natural to expect .",
    "here we should note that , if @xmath124 is modulated by the inflaton field then , under fairly general conditions , is an attractor solution during inflation , which arises due to the backreaction of the vector field onto the roll of the inflaton down the inflationary scalar potential @xcite .",
    "thus , even though , originally , the inflaton may be also fast - rolling , the backreaction slows down its roll and allows slow - roll inflation to occur even with a relatively steep scalar potential .",
    "indeed , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this is a neat way to overcome the infamous @xmath126-problem of inflation , while simultaneously obtaining as an attractor solution .",
    "now let us discuss the behaviour of the mode functions @xmath108 in more detail .",
    "firstly , we define @xmath127 from the above and eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) it is evident that , if then , while if then .",
    "note that always , while eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) requires that .",
    "it turns out that there are three possible stages for the mode evolution @xcite .",
    "when , then the mode is still subhorizon and it is oscillating so that it can be matched to the boundary conditions in eq .",
    "( [ bd ] ) .",
    "as time passes @xmath128 decreases and the mode becomes superhorizon .",
    "when then the mode is found to undergo power - law evolution .",
    "the third possible stage has to do with the case only , when @xmath129 is growing in time . in this case",
    "we could finally reach the time when , when the superhorizon mode begins oscillating again . since we are interested in superhorizon scales ( they are the ones which can affect the curvature perturbation as observed in the cmb ) we will consider the modes which are caught by the end of inflation either when , or when , which is possible only with .",
    "this is the case when when inflation ends .",
    "the mode functions for the superhorizon modes are found to be @xcite @xmath130 using this , the power spectra for the superhorizon perturbations of the vector field are @xmath131 where we used that the theory is parity invariant . because in this regime we find that , which means that particle production is strongly anisotropic .",
    "therefore , if inflation ends in this power - law regime then the contribution of the vector curvaton to the curvature perturbation has to be subdominant ( otherwise it would generate excessive statistical anisotropy ) , so that , which means that @xmath16 is primarily modulated by a scalar field and not by our vector curvaton . in this case , therefore , the vector curvaton can only generate some statistical anisotropy in @xmath0 .",
    "for the spectrum , the anisotropy parameter is ( cf .",

    "i.e. non - gaussianity is predominantly anisotropic .",
    "thus , if non - gaussianity is indeed observed and it does not feature a strong angular modulation this regime of this model will be ruled out . and @xmath136 , in contrast to the non - minimally coupled model of the previous section , where we only had one scale @xmath73 so that .",
    "]    if then and , because of eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) , .",
    "thus , in this case and the above are the only possibility . if , however , then and @xmath137 is decreasing in time . yet , scale invariance is maintained because the amplitude of the modes when they exit the horizon is reduced in time in accordance to the reduction of the value of the spectrum . as a result , the piling of modes does not spoil the flatness of the superhorizon spectrum @xcite .",
    "this case offers the possibility that @xmath136 will reach and surpass @xmath73 before the end of inflation .",
    "if this happens , then we are no more in the power - law regime .",
    "this regime corresponds to the possibility that when inflation ends . because of eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) , when the cosmological scales exit the horizon we have .",
    "thus , this regime can be realised only if @xmath136 is growing during inflation , which is possible only if .",
    "note that , when , particle production stops and the perturbation of the field on scales that leave the horizon becomes essentially zero ( exponentially suppressed ) .",
    "however , the superhorizon scales which left the horizon when the vector field was still light , retain their perturbations , which evolve as follows .    in this case , the mode functions are given by @xcite @xmath138 considering superhorizon modes ( i.e. ) and also that in this regime , the above simplify to @xmath139 thus , we see that the mode functions are undergoing rapid coherent oscillations since . using these , we find that the average of the power spectra is @xmath140 thus , we see that we have isotropic particle production , which implies ( cf .",
    "( [ pq ] ) ) . in this case",
    "we do not need the input of a scalar field to generate the curvature perturbation as @xmath0 can indeed be fully produced by the vector field alone . to our knowledge",
    "this is the only model that manages to produce @xmath0 without the direct involvement of a fundamental scalar field . because we need no scalar field , .",
    "then eqs .",
    "( [ fnleql ] ) and ( [ fnlsqz ] ) both reduce to @xmath141 which is identical to the case of a scalar curvaton @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to briefly consider the so - called `` borderline '' regime , when at the end of inflation .",
    "again , this is realisable only if @xmath136 is growing during inflation , i.e. when .    in this case one has @xmath142 where .",
    "thus , we see that , to satisfy observational bounds at least within 30% . if this is the case then it can be shown that @xcite @xmath143 therefore , statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and the non - gaussianity have the same magnitude , i.e. .",
    "this is an interesting characteristic signature for this scenario .",
    "when , it is straightforward to show that the equation of motion for the homogeneous physical vector field is @xmath144 which looks identical to the klein - gordon equation for a minimally coupled massive scalar field .",
    "if then and we have .",
    "this means that @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the initial value of @xmath136 ( , since @xmath136 is constant ) and @xmath147 is the initial value of .",
    "now , if then and the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eoma ] ) is @xcite @xmath148 which means that the typical value of the vector field is . using this , eq .",

    "let us briefly look into how the model parameters are constrained by the requirement that the vector field performs as a successful curvaton . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite such considerations impose the following constraint on the model parameters @xmath151 where ` dec ' denotes the moment of the vector curvaton decay , ` dom ' denotes the moment when the vector curvaton dominates the universe ( if it does not decay earlier than that ) , @xmath152 is the decay rate of the vector curvaton and @xmath153 is the final value of its mass at the end of inflation .    if the vector field is still light at the end of inflation , i.e. if , we are in the anisotropic regime . then we obtain @xcite @xmath154 using this and also the requirement that the curvaton decays before big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( i.e. where is the temperature at bbn ) the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ cons ] ) gives @xmath155    if the vector field becomes heavy by the end of inflation , i.e. if , then we are in the ( almost ) isotropic regime . in this case",
    "the vector curvaton alone can be responsible for @xmath0 as we have discussed .",
    "thus , we have @xcite @xmath156 this results in the following bound @xmath157 the above corresponds to a relatively high scale of inflation which , in supergravity models , may result in gravitino overproduction .",
    "however , the latter can be avoided through the entropy release by the vector curvaton decay which can dilute the gravitinos .",
    "taking into account that the vector curvaton can decay at least through gravitational couplings , we find . using this",
    "it can be shown that the oscillations of the massive vector field can not commence earlier than e - folds of inflation . as a result",
    ", the range of @xmath153 for which this regime can be realised is found to be @xcite @xmath158 from eqs .",
    "( [ range1 ] ) and ( [ range2 ] ) we see that there is ample parameter space for both the possibilities ( light or heavy vector curvaton ) to be realised .",
    "the high precision cosmological observations enable cosmologists to investigate beyond the `` vanilla '' predictions of inflation and thereby discriminate between inflation models . a new such observable",
    "is statistical anisotropy , which amounts to direction dependent patterns in the cmb ( and possibly large scale structure too ) .",
    "statistical anisotropy is within the reach of the forthcoming observations of the planck satellite mission , which is expected to release its first cosmological data in the beginning of 2013 .",
    "currently , the latest cmb observations allow statistical anisotropy in the spectrum as much as 30% ( ) .",
    "planck will reduce this bound down to 2% if statistical anisotropy is not observed .",
    "it should be noted here that , even if the spectrum is weakly statistically anisotropic , the bispectrum can be predominantly anisotropic with .",
    "this means that , if non - gaussianity is indeed observed without a strong angular modulation of @xmath3 on the microwave sky , then all models which predict will be ruled out .",
    "vector boson fields are natural candidates for the generation of statistical anisotropy in the curvature perturbation , because they are expected to pick a preferred direction when homogenised by inflation .",
    "the vector curvaton paradigm offers a simple , generic and effective mechanism for the direct contribution of vector boson fields to the curvature perturbation .",
    "the mechanism assumes a proca vector field , whose zero - mode begins oscillating when the field becomes heavy , after the end of inflation .",
    "as shown , the oscillating zero - mode behaves as a pressureless isotropic fluid and can ( nearly ) dominate the universe without generating an excessive anisotropic stress .",
    "when doing so it imposes its own contribution to the curvature perturbation , in accordance to the curvaton mechanism .",
    "we should point out here that this perturbation is scalar in nature , because it is due to the perturbed value of the density of the vector field , which is a scalar quantity .",
    "a considerable advantage of the vector curvaton mechanism is that it does not rely on an interaction of any kind between the vector field and the inflaton sectors .",
    "this allows the vector field to correspond to physics at a much lower energy scale ( e.g. tev physics ) than the scale of inflation , which may connect with observations in collider experiments such as the lhc .    the particle production process , through which the vector curvaton obtains a superhorizon spectrum of perturbations , is in general anisotropic",
    "this is because the vector boson field has more than one degrees of freedom ( three if massive ) , for which the efficiency of the particle production is in general different .",
    "thus , the curvature perturbation contributed by a vector curvaton is , in general , statistically anisotropic .",
    "if particle production is indeed isotropic ( at least at the level allowed by the observations ) the vector curvaton mechanism can generate the curvature perturbation in the universe from vector fields alone without directly involving any fundamental scalar fields . if , however , statistical anisotropy is indeed observed , then we _ have _ to go beyond scalar fields to explain the observations .",
    "this means that , the observation of statistical anisotropy in the cmb , may probe the gauge field content of theories beyond the standard model .    there are some related issues which we did not go into in this paper .",
    "for example , studies of the trispectrum in vector field scenarios @xcite , or of one - loop contributions @xcite . note also , the possibility that the vector curvaton is non - abelian is investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the contribution to the curvature perturbation by p - forms can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the interest now is in finding realistic candidates in theories beyond the standard model , which can play the role of the vector curvaton .",
    "examples can include the supermassive gauge bosons of grand unified theories @xcite or the vector fluxes on probe branes in the context of dbi - inflation @xcite .",
    "another promising idea is investigating the possibility that the vector bosons associated with gauged axions can play the role of the vector curvaton . in this case , the generation of parity - violating statistical anisotropy is possible @xcite .",

    "<S> two specific models for the generation of superhorizon spectra for the components of an abelian vector field are analysed . </S>",
    "<S> emphasis is put on the observational signatures of the models when the vector fields play the role of vector curvatons . if future observations support the vector curvaton mechanism this will open a window into the gauge field content of theories beyond the standard model .    </S>",
