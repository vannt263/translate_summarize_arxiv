    "topological quantum computation @xcite , is an approach to fault - tolerant quantum computation in which the unitary quantum gates result from the braiding of certain topological quantum objects , called ` anyons ' .",
    "anyons braid nontrivially : two counter - clockwise exchanges do not leave the state of the system invariant , unlike in the cases of bosons or fermions .",
    "anyons can arise in two ways : as localized excitations of an interacting quantum hamiltonian @xcite or as defects in an ordered system @xcite .",
    "fractionally - charged excitations of the laughlin fractional quantum hall liquid are an example of the former .",
    "abrikosov vortices in a topological superconductor are an example of the latter .",
    "not all anyons are directly useful in topological quantum computation ; only non - abelian anyons are useful , which does not include the anyonic excitations ( sometimes referred to as abelian anyons , to distinguish them from the more exotic non - abelian anyons which are useful for topological quantum computation ) that are believed to occur in most odd - denominator fractional quantum hall states .",
    "a collection of non - abelian anyons at fixed positions and with fixed local quantum numbers has a non - trivial topological degeneracy ( which is , therefore , robust  i.e. immune to weak local perturbations ) .",
    "this topological degeneracy allows quantum computation since braiding enables unitary operations between the distinct degenerate states of the system .",
    "the unitary transformations resulting from braiding depend only on the topological class of the braid , thereby endowing them with fault - tolerance .",
    "this topological immunity is protected by an energy gap in the system and a length scale discussed below .",
    "as long as the braiding operations are slow compared with the inverse of the energy gap and external perturbations are not strong enough to close the gap , the system remains robust to disturbances and noise .",
    "these braiding operations constitute the elementary gate operations for the evolution of the topological quantum computation .",
    "perhaps the simplest realization of a non - abelian anyon is a quasiparticle or defect supporting a majorana zero mode ( mzm ) .",
    "( the zero - mode here refers to the zero - energy midgap excitations that these localized quasiparticles typically correspond to in a low - dimensional topological superconductor . )",
    "this is a real fermionic operator that commutes with the hamiltonian . the existence of such operators guarantees topological degeneracy and , as we explain in section [ sec : what - is - mzm ] , braiding necessarily causes non - commuting unitary transformations to act on this degenerate subspace",
    ". the term `` majorana '' refers to the fact that these fermion operators are real , as in majorana s real version of the dirac equation .",
    "however , there is little connection with majorana s original work or its application to neutrinos .",
    "rather , the key concept here is the non - abelian anyon , and mzms are a particular mechanism by which a particular type of non - abelian anyons , usually called `` ising anyons '' can arise .",
    "by contrast , majorana fermions , as originally conceived , obey ordinary fermi - dirac statistics , and are simply a particular type of fermion . although the terminology ` majorana fermions ' is somewhat misleading for mzms , it is used extensively in the literature .",
    "if majorana zero modes can be manipulated and their states measured in well - controlled experiments , this could pave the way towards the realization of a topological quantum computer .",
    "the subject got a tremendous boost in 2012 when an experimental group in delft published evidence for the existence of majorana zero modes in insb nanowires @xcite , following earlier theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the specific experimental finding , which has been reproduced later in other laboratories , is a zero - bias tunneling conductance peak in a semiconductor ( insb or inas ) nanowire in contact with an ordinary metallic superconductor ( al or nb ) , which shows up only when a finite external magnetic field is applied to the wire .",
    "several other experimental groups also saw evidence ( i.e. zero bias tunneling conductance peak in an applied magnetic field ) for the existence of majorana zero - modes in both insb and inas nanowires @xcite , thus verifying the delft finding .",
    "however , though these experiments are compelling , they do not show exponential localization with system length required by eq .",
    "( eqn : mzm - real - def ) or anyonic braiding behavior .",
    "as explained later in this article , the exponential localization of the isolated majorana modes at wire ends and the associated non - abelian braiding properties are the key features which enable topological quantum computation to be possible in these systems .    in the current article , we provide a perspective on where this interesting and important subject is today ( at the end of 2014 ) .",
    "this is by no means a review article for the field of majorana zero modes or the topic of topological quantum computation since such reviews will be too lengthy and too technical for a general readership .",
    "there are , in fact , several specialized review articles already discussing various aspects of the subject matter which we mention here for the interested reader .",
    "the subject of topological quantum computation has been reviewed by us in great length earlier @xcite , and we have also written a shorter version of anyonic braiding - based topological quantum computation elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there are also several excellent popular articles on the braiding of non - abelian anyons and topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the theory of majorana zero - modes and their potential application to topological quantum computation has recently been reviewed in great technical depth in several articles @xcite .",
    "there are essentially two distinct physical systems that have been primarily studied in the search for majorana zero modes for topological quantum computation ( tqc ) .",
    "the first is the so - called 5/2-fractional quantum hall system ( `` 5/2-fqhs '' ) where the application of a strong perpendicular magnetic field to a very high - mobility two - dimensional ( 2deg ) electron gas ( confined in epitaxially - grown gaas - algaas quantum wells ) leads to the even - denominator fractional quantization of the hall resistance .",
    "the generic fractional quantum hall effect leads to the quantization with odd - denominator fractions ( e.g. the original @xmath0 quantization observed in the famous experiment by tsui , stormer , and gossard in 1982 @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , of the almost 100 fqhs states that have so far been observed in the laboratory , the 5/2-fqhs is the only even - denominator state ever found in a single 2d layer .",
    "it has been hypothesized that this even - denominator state supports ising anyons .",
    "a topological qubit was proposed by us for this platform @xcite in 2005 , building upon previous theoretical work on the @xmath1 state @xcite . tantalizing experimental signatures for the possible existence of the desired non - abelian anyonic properties were reported in subsequent experiments @xcite .",
    "however , these results have not been reproduced in other laboratories .",
    "potential barriers to progress are the required extreme high sample quality ( mobility @xmath2 @xmath3/v.s ) , very low @xmath4mk temperature and high magnetic field @xmath5 .",
    "the second system is the semiconductor nanowire structure proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , building upon earlier theoretical work on topological superconductors @xcite .",
    "semiconductor nanowires are the focus of this paper , but the @xmath1 fractional quantum hall state is a useful point of comparison since a great deal of experimental and theoretical work has been done on the 5/2 fqhs over the last 27 years .",
    "a majorana zero mode ( mzm ) is a fermionic operator @xmath6 that squares to @xmath7 ( and , therefore , is necesarily self - adjoint ) and commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath8 of a system : @xmath9 = 0\\ ] ] any operator that satisfies the first two conditions is called a majorana fermion operator . if it satisfies the third condition , as well , then it is a majorana zero mode operator or , simply , a majorana zero mode@xcite .",
    "the existence of such operators implies the existence of a degenerate space of ground states , in which quantum information can be stored .",
    "if there are @xmath10 majorana zero modes , @xmath11 ( they must come in pairs since each mzm is , in a sense , half a fermion ) satisfying @xmath12 then the hamiltonian can be simultaneously diagonalized with the operators @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the ground states can be labelled by the eigenvalues @xmath17 of these @xmath18 operators , thereby leading to a @xmath19-fold degeneracy .",
    "there is a two - state system associated with each _ pair _ of mzms .",
    "this is to be contrasted with a collection of spin-@xmath20 particles , for which there is a two - state system associated with each spin . in the case of mzms , we are free to pair them however we like ; different pairings correspond to different choices of basis in the @xmath19-dimensional ground state hilbert space .",
    "unfortunately , the preceding mathematics is too idealized for a real physical system .",
    "if we are fortunate , there can , instead , be self - adjoint majorana fermion operators @xmath11 satisfying the anti - commutation relations ( [ eqn : car ] ) and @xmath21 \\sim e^{-x/\\xi}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a length scale mentioned in the introduction ( which can be construed to be the separation between two mzms in the pair ) and discussed momentarily , and @xmath23 is a correlation length associated with the hamiltonian @xmath8 . in the superconducting systems that will be discussed in the sections to follow , @xmath23 will be the superconducting coherence length .",
    "all states above the @xmath24-dimensional low - energy subspace have a minimum energy @xmath25 . in order for the definition ( [ eqn : mzm - real - def ] ) to approach the ideal condition ( [ eqn : mzm - ideal - def ] ) , it must be possible to make @xmath22 sufficiently large that the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mzm - real - def ] ) approaches zero rapidly .",
    "this can occur if the operators @xmath26 are localized at points @xmath27 ( which we have not , so far , assumed ) .",
    "then @xmath26 commutes or anti - commutes , up to corrections @xmath28 , with , respectively , all local bosonic or fermionic operators that can be written in terms of electron creation and annihilation operators whose support is a minimum distance @xmath29 from some point @xmath27 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for energies much lower than @xmath25 is a sum of local terms , which means that products of operators such as @xmath30 must have exponentially - small coefficients @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the condition ( [ eqn : mzm - real - def ] ) then holds @xcite . the number of majorana zero mode operators satisfying ( [ eqn : mzm - real - def ] ) must be even . consequently ,",
    "if we add a term to the hamiltonian that couples a single zero mode operator to the non - zero mode operators , a zero mode operator will remain since zero modes can only be lifted in pairs .",
    "thus , the exponential ` protection ' of the mzms allowing their quantum degeneracy is enabled by the energy gap , which should be as large as possible for effective tqc operations .",
    "thus , in a loose sense , two majoranas together give a dirac fermion , and these two mzms must be far away from each other for the exponential topological protection to apply .",
    "it is useful to combine the two mzms into a single dirac fermion @xmath32 .",
    "the two states of this pair of zero modes corresponds to the fermion parities @xmath33 .",
    "thus , if the total fermion parity of a system is fixed , then the degeneracy of @xmath10 mzms is @xmath24-fold .",
    "this quantum degeneracy , arising from the topological nature of the mzms , enables tqc to be feasible by braiding the mzms around each other .",
    "such localized mzms are known to occur in two related but distinct physical situations .",
    "the first is at a defect in an ordered state , such as a vortex in a superconductor or a domain wall in a 1d system .",
    "the defect does not have finite energy in the thermodynamic limit and , therefore , it is not possible to excite a pair of such defects at finite energy cost and pull them apart .",
    "however , by tuning experimental parameters ( which involves energies proportional to the system size ) , such defects can be created in pairs , thereby creating pairs of mzms .",
    "the best example of this is a topological superconductor .",
    "alternatively , there may be finite - energy quasiparticle excitations of a topological phase @xcite that support zero modes .",
    "this scenario is believed to be realized in the @xmath34 fractional quantum hall states , where charge @xmath35 excitations are hypothesized to support mzms .",
    "although the cases of defects in topological supercondcutors and quasiparticles in `` true '' topological phases are closely - related , there are some important differences , touched on later .    when two defects or quasiparticles supporting mzms are exchanged while maintaining a distance greater than @xmath23 , their mzms",
    "must also be exchanged .",
    "since the @xmath26 operators are real , the exchange process can , at most , change their signs .",
    "moreover , fermion parity must be conserved , which dictates that @xmath36 and @xmath37 must pick up opposite signs .",
    "hence , the transformation law is : @xmath38 the overall sign is a gauge choice .",
    "this transformation is generated by the unitary operator : @xmath39 this is the braiding transformation of ising anyons . strictly speaking",
    ", ising anyons have @xmath40 .",
    "other values of @xmath41 can occur if there are additional abelian anyons attached to the ising anyons , as is believed to occur in the @xmath34 fractional quantum hall state . in the case of defects , rather than quasiparticles , the phase @xmath41 will not , in general , be universal , and will depend on the particular path through which the defects were exchanged .",
    "we emphasize that this braiding transformation law follows from ( a ) the reality condition of the majorana fermion operators @xmath42 , ( b ) the locality of the mzms , and ( c ) conservation of fermion parity .",
    "therefore , an experimental observation consistent with such a braiding transformation is evidence that ( a)-(c ) hold .",
    "this , in turn is evidence that the defects or quasiparticles support majorana zero modes satisfying the definition ( [ eqn : mzm - real - def ] ) .",
    "such a direct experimental observation of braiding has not yet happened in the laboratory .    in the case of quasiparticles in topological phases , braiding properties , as revealed through various concrete proposed interference experiments such as those proposed in refs .",
    ", is , perhaps , the gold standard for detecting mzms .",
    "however , in the case of defects in ordered states and , in particular , in the special case of mzms in superconductors , a zero - bias peak in transport with a normal lead @xcite and a @xmath43 periodic josephson effect @xcite are also signatures , as discussed in section [ sec : other - signatures ] . before discussing these in more detail in section [ sec : other - signatures ] , it may be helpful to discuss the differences between topological superconductors and true topological phases .",
    "as noted in the introduction , ising anyons can be understood as quasiparticles or defects that support majorana zero modes . in the moore - read pfaffian state @xcite and the anti - pfaffian state @xcite , proposed as candidate non - abelian states for the 5/2 fqhs , charge-@xmath35",
    "quasiparticles are ising anyons @xcite .",
    "there is theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite evidence that the @xmath34 fractional quantum hall state is in one of these two universality classes .",
    "however , there are also some experiments @xcite that do not agree with this hypothesis . the non - abelian statistics of quasiparticles at @xmath34 has been reviewed in ref . and would require a digression into the physics of the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "hence , we do not elaborate on it here , other than to note that ising - type fractional quantum hall states are very nearly topological phases , apart from some deviations that are salient on higher - genus surfaces @xcite .",
    "however , the electrical charge that is attached to ising anyons enables their detection through charge transport experiments @xcite . ising anyons also occur in some lattice models of gapped , topologically - ordered spin liquids @xcite .",
    "these are true topological phases in which the mzm operators are associated with finite - energy excitations of the system and do not have a local relation to the underlying spin operators , much less the electron operators , whose charge degree of freedom is gapped .",
    "this limits the types of effects ( in comparison to the superconducting case ) that could break the topological degeneracy implied by eqs .",
    "[ eqn : mzm - ideal - def ] and [ eqn : car ] .",
    "mzms also occur at defects in certain types of superconductors that form a subset of the class generally called `` topological superconductors '' @xcite .",
    "we discuss these in general terms in this section and then in the context of specific physical realizations in section [ sec : synthetic ] .",
    "topological phases have some topological features and some `` ordinary '' non - topological features .",
    "however , the interplay between these two types of physics is even more central in topological superconductors .",
    "this is both `` bad '' and `` good . ''",
    "it is `` bad '' if the nontopological features represent an opportunity for error or lead to energy splittings that decohere desirable superpositions .",
    "it is `` good '' when they allow a convenient coupling to conventional physics , something we had better have available if we ever wish to measure the topological system . in topological phases",
    ", there is a trivial tensor product situation in which the topological and the  ordinary  degrees of freedom do not talk to each other . in this case , we do not have to worry that the latter induce errors in the former , but they also will not be useful in initializing or measuring the topological degrees of freedom .",
    "( as always , in discussing topological physics , we regard effects that diminish exponentially with length , frequency , or temperature as unimportant .",
    "this is somewhat analogous to computer scientists classifying algorithms as polynomial time or slower .",
    "clearly the power and even the constants can make a difference , but such a structural dichotomy is a useful starting point . )",
    "so , for example , if there are phonons in a system , their interaction with topological degrees of freedom causes a splitting of the topological degeneracy that vanishes as @xmath44 at zero temperature @xcite , so we would consider the system as essentially a tensor product , with the phonons in a separate factor .",
    "however , a topological superconductor is not a true topological phase but , rather , following the terminology of ref . a `` fermion parity protected quasi topological phase '' .",
    "the qualifier `` quasi '' permits the existence of benign gapless modes as discussed above . with slightly more precision",
    ": an excitation is topological if its local density matrices can not be produced to high fidelity by a local operator acting from one of the system s ground states .",
    "`` quasi '' permits low - energy excitations ( below the gap ) provided they are not `` topological '' .",
    "these subgap excitations surely do exist in real topological superconductors : there will be phonons and there will be gapless excitations of the superconducting order parameter - both are goldstone modes of broken symmetries ( translation in the first case and u(1)-charge conservation in the second ) .",
    "( the reader may wonder why the now - so - famous higgs mechanism fails to gap the goldstone mode of broken u(1 ) .",
    "the answer is the mismatch of dimensions , the gauge field roams 3-dimensional space while the superconductor lives in either two or one dimension . in the former case ,",
    "the interaction with the gauge field causes superconducting phase fluctuations to have dispersion @xmath45 while in the latter case @xmath46 . in a bulk 3d super conductor the gauge boson is indeed gapped out . )",
    "the more serious caveat is `` fermion parity protected '' .",
    "this is simultaneously a blessing and a curse for any project to compute with majorana zero modes in superconductors .",
    "the blessing is that the basis states of the topological qubit have this precise interpretation : fermion parity .",
    "if we are willing to move into an unprotected regime to measure them , mzms can be brought together and their charge parity detected locally . using more sophistication , one could keep the mzms at topological separation and exploit the aharonov - casher effect to measure the charge parity encircled by a vortex .",
    "so this coupling will allow measurement by physics very well in hand .",
    "( it is less clear how to do this with , for instance , the computationally more powerful fibonacci anyons @xcite . )",
    "measurement is crucial for processing quantum information with mzms since the braid group representation for ising anyons is a rather modest finite group : beyond input and output , distillation of quantum states is needed @xcite , and this is measurement intensive .",
    "the curse is quasi - particle - poisoning .",
    "a nearby electron can enter the system and be absorbed by a majorana zero mode , thereby flipping the fermion parity ",
    "i.e. flipping a qubit .",
    "the electrons charge is absorbed by the superconducting condensate .",
    "this propensity of a topological superconductor to be poisoned ( or equivalently , the fermion parity to flip in an uncontrolled manner ) represents a salient distinction from the moore - read state proposed for the @xmath34 fractional quantum hall state . in the moore - read state ,",
    "the vortices carry electric charge ( @xmath47 ) and fermions carry charge @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , there is an energy gap to bringing an electron from the outside into a @xmath34 fqhe fluid .",
    "its fermion parity can be absorbed by a majorana zero mode ( as in the case of a topologial superconductor ) , but there is no condensate to absorb its charge ; instead , four disjoint charge-@xmath35 quasiparticles must be created , with their attendant energy cost .",
    "it would be harder to poison a @xmath34 fluid but also harder to discern its state and the signatures discussed in the next section are not available for non - abelian fqhs states .",
    "thus , one must choose between potentially better protection ( 5/2 fqhe ) or easier measurement ( topological superconductor ) .",
    "due to the superconducting order parameter , it is possible for an electron to tunnel directly into a mzm in a superconductor .",
    "suppose there is a mzm @xmath6 at the origin @xmath50 in a superconductor .",
    "then , if we bring a metallic wire near the origin , electrons can tunnel from the lead to the superconductor via a coupling of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the electron annihilation operator in the lead . for simplicity",
    ", we have suppressed the spin index , which is a straightforward notational choice if the supercondutor and the lead are both fully spin - polarized . in the more generic case",
    ", the spin index must be handled with slightly more care .",
    "here , @xmath41 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "ordinarily , we would expect that it would be impossible for an electron , which carries electrical charge , to tunnel into a majorana zero mode , which is neutral since @xmath53 .",
    "however , the superconducting condensate ( which is a condensate of cooper pairs that breaks the u(1 ) charge conservation symmetry ) can accomodate electrical charge , thereby allowing this process , which is a form of andreev reflection . in the case of the moore - read pfaffian quantum hall state ,",
    "however , this is not possible . in order for an electron to tunnel into an mzm , four charge-@xmath35 quasiparticles",
    "must also be created in order to conserve electrical charge .",
    "this can only happen when the bias voltage exceeds four times the charge gap .    in the case of a topological superconductor , the coupling ( [ eqn : zm - lead - coupling ] ) , which seems like a drawback as compared to a topological phase ,",
    "can actually be an advantage since it opens up the possibility of a simple way of detecting majorana zero modes that does not involve braiding them .",
    "for at @xmath54 , the electrical conductivity from a 1d wire through a contact described by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : zm - lead - coupling ] ) takes the form @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a crossover scale determined by the tunneling strength , @xmath58 , where the exponent @xmath29 depends on the interaction strength in the 1d normal wire so that @xmath59 for a wire with vanishing interactions . at low voltage and low temperature ,",
    "the conductivity is @xmath60 , indicative of perfect andreev reflection : each electron that impinges on the contact is reflected as a hole and charge @xmath61 is absorbed by the topological superconductor .",
    "there is vanishing amplitude for an electron to be scattered back normally .",
    "such a conductivity can occur for other reasons ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , but they are non - generic and require some special circumstances and can , in principle , be ruled out by further experiments .",
    "thus the observation of perfect andreev reflection , with the associated quantized conductance at zero bias , robust to parameter changes , is an indication of the presence of a majorana zero mode . in section [ sec",
    ": experiments ] , we discuss the extent to which this quantized tunneling conductance associated with the zero - energy midgap majorana modes has actually been observed in experiments .",
    "a second probe of majorana zero modes that is special to topological superconductors is the the so - called fractional josephson effect .",
    "when two normal superconductors are in electrical contact , separated by a thin insulator or a weak link , the dominant coupling between them at low temperatures is @xmath62 where @xmath41 is the difference in the phases of the order parameters of the two superconductors .",
    "it is periodic in @xmath41 with period @xmath63 .",
    "the josephson current is the derivative of this coupling with respect to @xmath41 ; it , too , is periodic in @xmath41 with period @xmath63 .",
    "the josephson coupling is proportional to the square of the amplitude for an electron to tunnel from one superconductor to the other , @xmath64 .",
    "however , when two topologial superconductors are in contact and there are mzms on both sides of the josephson junction , the leading coupling is : @xmath65 so long as @xmath66 remains fixed during the measurement , the josephson current now has period @xmath43 , rather than @xmath63 as in nontopological superconductors .",
    "an observation of the @xmath43 ` fractional ' josephson effect in ac measurements would be compelling evidence in favor of the existence of mzms in a superconducting system .",
    "however , if @xmath66 can vary in order to find the minimum energy at each value of @xmath41 , then it will flip when @xmath67 changes sign .",
    "consquently , the current will have period @xmath63 .",
    "the value of @xmath66 can change if a fermion is absorbed by one of the zero modes @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "such a fermion may come from a localized low - energy state or an out - of - equilibrium fermion excited above the supercondcuting gap . in order to use the josephson effect to detect mzms ,",
    "an ac measurement must be done at frequencies higher than the inverse of the time scale for such processes .",
    "this can be done through the observation of shapiro steps @xcite . when an ordinary josephson junction is subjected to electromagnetic waves at frequency @xmath70 , a dc voltage develops and passes through a series of steps @xmath71 as the current",
    "is increased .",
    "however , when there are majorana zero modes at the junction , then the @xmath43 periodicity discussed above translates to shapiro steps @xmath72 .",
    "in essence , charge transport across a junction with mzms is due to charge @xmath73 rather than charge @xmath61 objects , so the flux periodicity and voltage steps are doubled . in terms of conventional shapiro steps",
    ", the odd steps should be missing @xcite , but the experiment actually observes only one missing odd step .",
    "this simple picture of missing odd shapiro steps , although physically plausible , may not be complete , and a complete theory for shapiro steps in the presence of mzms has not yet been formulated ( see , however , ref . ) .",
    "before further discussing experimental probes of ising anyons , we pause to discuss ` synthetic ' realizations of topological superconductors because it will be useful to have concrete device structures in mind when we describe procedures for braiding non - abelian anyons .",
    "` synthetic ' systems are important because there is no known ` natural ' system that spontaneously enters a topological superconducting phase .",
    "the a - phase of superfluid he-3 @xcite and superconducting sr@xmath74ruo@xmath75 @xcite are hypothesized to possess some topological properties , but it is not known precisely how to bring these systems into topological superconducting phases that support mzms , nor is it known precisely how to detect and manipulate majorana zero modes in these systems @xcite .",
    "there are also specific proposals for converting ultracold superfluid atomic fermionic gases into topological superfluids @xcite , but experimental progress has been slow in the atomic systems because of inherent heating problems",
    ". however , topological superconductivity can occur in`synthetic ' systems @xcite that combine ordinary non - topological superconductors with other materials , thereby facilitating interplay between superconductivity and other ( explicitly , rather than spontaneously ) broken symmetries .",
    "the following single - particle hamiltonian is a simple toy model for a topological superconducting wire @xcite which illustrates how mzms can arise at the ends of a 1d wire : @xmath76   - \\mu c^\\dagger_i c^{}_{i }   \\\\",

    "@xmath84 , @xmath85  i.e. they are majorana fermion operators .",

    "this can be done with a zeeman splitting that is large enough to fully spin - polarize the system , but superconductivity has never been observed in such a system ; if induced through the superconducting proximity effect , it is likely to be very weak since the amplitude of cooper pair tunneling from the superconductor into the ferromagnet would be very small . however , the surface state of a 3d topological insulator @xcite has such a band which can be exploited for these purposes@xcite .",

    "however , the peak conductance is expected to be suppressed by non - zero temperature in conjunction with finite tunnel barrier , and in short wires ( see , e.g. refs . ) . some of the experiments do appear to find that the zero - bias peak sometimes splits @xcite and that this splitting oscillates with magnetic field , as predicted @xcite , although a detailed quantitative comparison between experimental and theoretical zero bias peak splittings has not yet been carried out in depth , and such a comparison necessitates detailed knowledge about the experimental set ups ( e.g. whether the system is at constant density or constant chemical potential @xcite ) unavailable at the current time .",
    "the softness of the gap may be due to disorder , especially inhomogeneity in the strength of the superconducting proximity effect @xcite or perhaps an inverse proximity effect at the tunnel barriers where normal electrons could tunnel in from the metallic leads into the superconducting wire , leading to subgap states @xcite .",
    "the softness of the gap may also help explain why the zero - bias conductance is suppressed from its expected quantized peak value , although other factors ( e.g. finite wire length , finite temperature , finite tunnel barrier , etc . ) are likely to be playing a role too .",
    "very recent experimental efforts @xcite using epitaxial superconductor ( al)-semiconductor ( inas ) interfaces have led to hard proximity gaps .",
    "the absence of a visible gap closing at the putative quantum phase transition may be due to the vanishing amplitude of bulk states near the ends of the wire @xcite ; a tunneling probe into the middle of the wire would then observe a gap closing ( but presumably no mzm peaks which should decay exponentially with distance from the ends of the wires ) .",
    "such a gap closing has been tentatively identified in the experiments on inas nanowires in ref . .",
    "in the experiment of ref . , it was observed that the @xmath131 shapiro step was suppressed for magnetic fields larger than @xmath132 t . if this is the critical field beyond which @xmath133 in this device , then all of the odd shapiro steps should be suppressed .",
    "however , one could argue that the fermion parity of the mzms fluctuates more rapidly at higher voltages so that only the @xmath131 step is suppressed .",
    "more theoretical work is necessary to understand shapiro step behavior in the presence of mzms ( see , however , ref . ) .",
    "zbps can occur for other reasons , which must be ruled out before one can conclude that the experiments of refs .",
    "have observed a mzm , particularly since the expected conductance quantization associated with the perfect andreev reflection has not been seen .",
    "the kondo effect leads to a zbp @xcite . in the presence of spin - orbit coupling and a magnetic field",
    ", the two - level system may not be the two states of a spin-1/2 , but may be a singlet state and the lowest state of a triplet , which become degenerate at some non - zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the zbp may be due to ` resonant andreev scattering ' .",
    "of course , a mzm is a type of resonant andreev bound state so this alternative really means that there may be an andreev bound state at the end of the wire that is not due to topological superconductivity but is ` accidentally ' ( i.e. at one point in parameter space , rather than across an entire phase ) at zero energy .",
    "zbps could also arise simply due to strong disorder due to antilocalization at zero energy in 1d systems without time - reversal , charge conservation , or spin - rotational symmetry , usually called class d superconductors @xcite .",
    "the multiple observations of a zero - bias peak in different laboratories , occuring only in parameter regimes consistent with theory @xcite substantiate these interesting observations in semiconductor nanowires and show that they are , indeed , real effects and not experimental artifacts .",
    "although these experiments are broadly consistent with the presence of majorana zero modes at the ends of these wires , there is still room for skepticism , which can be answered by showing that the zbps evolve as expected when the wires are made longer , the soft gap is hardened ( which has happened recently @xcite ) , and the expected gap closing observed at the quantum phase transition .",
    "finally , experiments that demonstrate the fractional ac josephson effect and the expected non - abelian braiding properties of mzms would settle the matter .    very recently , there has been an interesting new development : the claim of an observation of mzms in metallic ferromagnetic ( specifically , fe ) nanowires on superconducting ( specifically , pb ) substrates where zbps appear at the wire ends without the application of any external magnetic field , presumably because of the large exchange spin splitting already present in the fe wire @xcite .",
    "there have been several theoretical analyses of this ferromagnetic nanowire majorana platform @xcite showing that such a system is indeed generically capable of supporting mzms without any need for fine - tuning of the chemical potential , i.e. the system is always in the topological phase since the spin splitting @xmath120 is always much larger than @xmath25 and @xmath121 .",
    "although potentially an important development , more data ( particularly , at lower temperatures , higher induced superconducting gap values , and longer wires ) would be necessary before any firm conclusion can be drawn about the experiment of ref . since the current experiments , which are carried out at temperatures comparable to the induced topological superconducting energy gap in wires much shorter than the majorana coherence length , only manifest very weak ( @xmath134 orders of magnitude weaker than @xmath60 ) and very broad ( broader than the energy gap ) zbps . if validated as mzms , this new metallic platform gives a boost to the study of non - abelian anyons in solid state systems .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the primary significance of majorana zero modes is that they are a mechanism for non - abelian braiding statistics , arising from their ground state topological quantum degeneracy .",
    "the braiding of non - abelian anyons provides a set of robust quantum gates with topological protection ( although , of course , this only applies if the temperature is much lower than the energy gap and all anyons are kept much further apart than the correlation length , so that the system is in the exponentially - small majorana energy splitting regime ) .",
    "these braiding properties are also the most direct and unequivocal way to detect non - abelian anyons  including , as a special case , those supporting majorana zero modes .    it is useful , at this point , to make a distinction between the two computational uses of braiding , for unitary gates and for projective measurement .",
    "braiding - based gates can operate in essentially the same way for quasiparticles in a topological phase and for defects in an ordered ( quasi - topological ) state . however , braiding - based measurement procedures rely on interferometry , which is only possible if the motional degrees of freedom of the objects being braided are sufficiently quantum - mechanical .",

    "practically , the fidelity of the clifford operations implementing the stabilizer checks dictates the minimum @xmath182 achievable using the distillation protocol .",
    "for example , to achieve @xmath183 , a reasonable value for quantum algorithms , the clifford operations must also have fidelity of @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "conventional qubit systems will require , e.g. , the surface code to achieve such fidelities on the clifford operations , while topological qubit systems may achieve this fidelity naturally .",
    "thus , a potential advantage of mzm - based tqc would be the need for fewer qubits and fewer gate operations than in conventional quantum computation .",
    "a given quantum algorithm must be decomposed into a circuit consisting of gates drawn from a fault - tolerant universal gate set , such as the set consisting of @xmath147 .",
    "quantum algorithm decomposition methods based on algebraic number theory have recently dramatically reduced the number of @xmath135 gates required to implement a given quantum algorithm @xcite . by additionally allowing an ancilla qubit and measurement to be used during decomposition , another constant factor reduction in the number of @xmath135 gates can be achieved @xcite .",
    "the latter technques are referred to as probabilistic  repeat - until - success \" ( rus ) circuits .",
    "these aforementioned methods , as well as , e.g. , techniques to produce fourier angle states @xcite , may be ultimately hybridized to more efficiently and fault - tolerantly implement a quantum algorithm using majorana anyons .    before concluding this section , we briefly mention some of the potential problems in carrying out tqc with the current majorana nanowire systems .",
    "first , the soft gap problem alluded to above indicates the presence of considerable non - thermal subgap fermionic states which would cause quasiparticle poisoning of the mzm as the majorana will hybridize with the subgap fermions and decay ( and thereby lose its non - abelian anyonic character ) .",
    "thus , poisoning by stray subgap non - thermal quasiparticles puts an absolute upper bound on the effective majorana coherence time since poisoning will directly destroy the fermion parity at the heart of the proposed non - abelian tqc .",
    "recent experimental work has suppressed quasiparticle poisoning considerably , leading to possible coherence times as long as 1 minute @xcite .",
    "another issue is that the current experimental topological gap is rather small ( a few k ) whereas the majorana splitting due to the overlap of the mzms from the two ends of the nanowire are likely to be in the range of 100 - 200 mk ( since the current nanowires are rather short ) .",
    "the lack of a large separation between these two energy scales introduces complications since the tqc braiding operations must be slow ( `` adiabatic '' ) compared with the topological gap energy and fast ( so that one is in the topologically protected regime ) compared with the majorana splitting energy .",
    "improvement in materials should lead to larger ( smaller ) gap ( splitting ) , making this issue go away eventually .",
    "finally , the current zbps , even assuming that they are indeed the predicted mzm conductance peaks , are much smaller ( by more than an order of magnitude ) than the quantized mzm conductance value of @xmath60 associated with the majorana - induced perfect andreev reflection , perhaps because of finite temperature , short wire length , and finite tunnel barrier at the interfaces .",
    "this could lead to severe visibility problem during majorana braiding with very weak signal to noise ratio , necessitating considerable measurement averaging .",
    "only future braiding experiments could actually decisively establish whether the observed zbps in the nanowire tunneling measurements are indeed the predicted mzms or not .",
    "it does not seem fanciful to compare majorana systems and nonabelian topological quantum systems in general with the field effect transistor ( fet ) . both are sweet theoretical solutions to the problem of efficient processing of signals and the information they carry .",
    "( for fets , of course , this theoretical solution has turned out , through moore s law , to be an astounding practical engineering success as well , leading to the modern it universe we live in . ) the kinds of information ( classical versus quantum ) and the energy scales ( ev versus mev ) are different , just as the two ideas are temporally separated by more than 50 years , but each proposes a radical solution to an information processing roadblock . in each case , the roadblock was not absolute but sufficiently daunting to inspire serious and sustained effort .",
    "there were pre - transistor electronic computers , and it may well be possible to build a pre - topological quantum computer through an extraordinary investment in error correction using ordinary non - topological qubits @xcite . as with our current efforts to build majorana zero mode systems ,",
    "the history of the fet was anchored in materials development and required a rethinking of solid state physics ( involving substantial and continuous developments in surface science , semiconductor physics , materials growth , and lithography ) . today",
    ", building topological materials will push the frontiers of purity and precision in materials growth and force us to extend our ability to model exotic bulk materials , interfaces , and , finally , devices . since our entire civilization now turns around the transistor",
    ", it would be grandiloquent to claim any untested technology as the new transistor , and we make no such claim .",
    "no one can see the future .",
    "however , we have arrived at a gateway where , in the next few years , our ability to process information may explode disruptively ; there is certainly a large heterogeneous international effort in this direction of building quantum information processing devices and circuits .",
    "in such a world the topological route is the analog of the fet .",
    "edgar lilienfeld filed the first fet patent in 1925 .",
    "it was in an entirely metallic system in which the required electronic depletion was too difficult to accomplish reliably .",
    "it took roughly four decades and the advent of semiconductor devices to realize the initial fet vision . where do we stand with majorana zero mode systems today ?",
    "experimentalists have picked the most promising materials : high land @xmath126-factor ( to keep the applied @xmath122-fields moderate ) , high spin - orbit coupling ( to strongly lock the spin and momentum bands in order to produce a large topological superconducting gap ) , low schottky barriers and good epitaxial contact ( to facilitate induced superconductivity ) , and high mobility ( for coherent transport ) , among what was known , i.e. `` lying around '' , and predicted by the theorists .",
    "incremental improvements in nanowire design , pacification of interfaces , and transparency to contacting superconductors , may take us into the regime of workable devices - the transistor of the 1950s .",
    "but one may expect now that the concepts are clear , that systematic study of materials and their growth and interface properties could easily lead to new choices .",
    "a lesson already emerging from experiments in copenhagen @xcite can radically reduce subgap states .",
    "their data shows a remarkably crisp bcs spectrum in epitaxially - coated nanowires @xcite .",
    "we can not of course be sure that the appropriate materials for the future tqc devices have already been developed after all , the first transistors were made of germanium although silicon now rules the electronics world but there is now a clear path for progress toward the eventual building of tqc using majorana anyons .",
    "the `` materials frontier '' discussed above addresses fidelity and lifetimes  the `` numerator '' of the expression defining computational power .",
    "the denominator is the clock rate . in the case of a majorana zero mode system , the key time scale is that of measurement . as explained in section [",
    "sec : quantum - inf ] , measurement of fermion parity is essential to the distillation of magic states , and is the leading candidate even for braiding operations . to compute",
    "well we must be able to measure quickly and accurately .",
    "the two figures of merit are in fact related : if we can make @xmath18 measurements within the qubit lifetime , it does us no good if the fidelity is less than @xmath185 , for with less fidelity the qubit state will be forgotten long before we make the @xmath186 measurement . for computations in parallel ( as will be the norm ) , the demands on fidelity are proportionately greater because the appropriate @xmath18 is the _ total _ number of measurements during the computation , not the number on any particular qubit .",
    "this tells us that there will be a second `` measurement frontier '' in which accuracy and speed will be the figures of merit .",
    "the leading measurement ideas today involve coupling to superconducting qubits living in an optical cavity and using a shift in the resonant frequency of the microwaves to read out fermion parity @xcite .",
    "this is certainly a good starting point , but the typical number are photon frequencies @xmath187 ghz and , with beat frequencies recording the energy spitting of tens of mhz , read out would be limited to perhaps a mhz clock speed .",
    "the inherent energy scales of present majorana zero mode systems are on the order of @xmath7 k @xmath188 ghz",
    "so there is room to do much better .",
    "in fact , to combine the two frontiers one might envision exploiting exotic superconductors with very large ( @xmath189k ) energy gap , pnictides or cuprates @xcite , in conjuction with semiconductor wires to increase the gap protecting majorana systems and clock rates by an order of magnitude .",
    "lifetimes / clock rate are hardware specs , but equally important is the scaling of the algorithms that we will run .",
    "there have been roughly three epochs : 1 ) circa 1982 , feynman @xcite told us that if we could build a quantum computer , its resource requirements would scale in precisely the same way as the quantum mechanical problems , e.g . , quantum chemistry problems , we wished to solve - replacing the exponential scaling of a classical computer ( in which memory must double to account for each new spin-@xmath20 degree of freedom ) .",
    "2 ) in the 1990s and 2000s , many key quantum algorithms were developed , including shor s factoring algorithm @xcite , and a detailed analysis of feynman s idea .",
    "3 ) recent papers have focused on realistic regimes for quantum chemistry , rather than asymptotics .",
    "a straightforward estimate for gate counts of quantum chemistry hamiltonians found that the number of computational steps for near equilibration to the ground state scaled rather disastrously ; polynomially by very high powers @xmath190 so that to obtain the energy of feo@xmath74 to a millihartree with a ghz clock rate would take the age of the universe @xcite",
    ". however , improved estimates @xcite , combined with some algorithmic improvement @xcite , has this time down now to a few minutes ( with the most recent polynomial scaling @xmath191th power ) .",
    "this is one example ; now that quantum computers appear to be increasingly realistic , computer scientists and physicists will find efficient quantum algorthims for an array of problems .",
    "many of these will be physical ( e.g. , quantum field theory @xcite and many - body localization are attractive targets @xcite ) , but even areas distant from physics are seeing quantum advances .",
    "deep learning has had a dramatic impact on machine learning in the last few years @xcite , but there is a computational bottleneck : computation of the true gradient of @xmath107 , where @xmath107 is the  log - likelihood function \" , is classically intractable , leading to classical methods that can efficiently only approximate @xmath192 . in physical terms",
    ", @xmath107 is an entropy of a transverse field ising model on a union of complete bipartite graphs .",
    "it is now known @xcite that quantum computers may be used to estimate @xmath192 efficiently by emulating the corresponding ising model , which leads to improved deep learning models using a quantum computer .",
    "but when do we get to the analog of the silicon fet ? presumably we will eventually do better than majorana zero modes .",
    "even as we anticipate great breakthroughs in the physics and engineering of majorana systems , we can anticipate their eventual eclipse by anyonic systems ( e.g. fibonacci ) that have topologically - protected universal quantum operation . for many years , that phrase primarily meant a dense braid group representation .",
    "majorana zero modes mirror the topological phase associated with su(2)@xmath74 ( see , e.g. ref . for an explanation of this notation ) .",
    "fibonacci anyons are present in su(2)@xmath193 and have dense braid group representations .",
    "furthermore , there is a hint of a potential path toward physical realization @xcite through a combination of fractional quantum hall effect ( at the @xmath194 plateau ) and superconductivity .",
    "su(2 ) and all levels 5 and higher also have dense braiding but seem physically impractical .",
    "su(2)@xmath75 is an anomaly ; it is potentially related to metaplectic anyonic systems @xcite with a proposed realization @xcite , but braiding alone does not furnish a dense gate set .",
    "however , recent unpublished work @xcite has demonstrated that su(2)@xmath75 becomes universal when braiding is combined with interferometric measurement .",
    "we are poised on the brink of a revolution in our ability to control quantum systems .",
    "topological systems , initially majorana systems , will play a role .",
    "how wide the technological impact will be outside of physics in not foreseeable , but we can say that we are standing at a transition  we are about to learn to process information - to _ think _ , so to speak , - in the manner that we know the universe operates : quantum mechanically .",
    "the first steps in this intellectual journey have been taken with the potential realization of mzms in the laboratory @xcite , but we still have a long way to go ."
