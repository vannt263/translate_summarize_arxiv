    ".      the line profiles entering the inversion code miss ( multi - line inversion of stellar spectra ) were carefully selected following the same criteria employed for the solar case ( allende prieto et al .",

    "( 1993 ) , their transition probabilities should have been measured by blackwell and collaborators in oxford ( e.g. blackwell & shallis 1979 ) , and they should be weaker than 80 m  in equivalent width ( w@xmath13 ) , to minimize both departures from lte , and the underestimate of the line damping by using the unsld approximation ( see , e.g. , ryan 1998 ) .",
    "these criteria provided 13 lines of iron , calcium , titanium , and chromium in the spectral range covered for gmb1830 , and 10 of them were also useful for @xmath0 eri ( the restriction of the lines w@xmath13 to be smaller than 80 m  was slightly relaxed for @xmath0 eri ) .",
    "this is a significantly smaller number of lines than the set employed for the solar inversion but , as we shall demonstrate below , the atmospheric structure can still be derived with confidence .",

    "the inversion proceeds analogously to the solar case , starting from an isothermal model photosphere ( @xmath14= 5000 k ) , increasing progressively the number of nodes until either no significant improvement in the fit of the line profiles is achieved or the temperature structure shows wiggles , which are evidence that the degree of the chosen polynomial is too high .",
    "the solar abundances ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) were taken as starting point for @xmath0 eri , while the abundances of the elements heavier than helium were scaled by a factor 0.0316 ( [ m / h ] = 1.5 ) for gmb1830 .",
    "the abundances assumed at the beginning do not determine the final result .",
    "1 shows the evolution of the iron abundance through the inversion procedure for gmb1830 , assuming different initial guesses .",
    "an initial iron abundance that was more than @xmath4 0.3 dex from [ fe / h ] =  1.5 provided a significantly different final abundance and a model photosphere that did not fit adequately the observed line profiles .",
    "the rotational velocity and the gaussian macroturbulence were allowed to vary , while the microturbulence was assumed to be solar ( @xmath4 0.6 km s@xmath8 ) , negligible , or larger than 1 km s@xmath8 , finally keeping the best value from the point of view of the @xmath15 criterion between observed and synthetic spectra .",
    "a gaussian profile was used to represent for the instrumental profile .",
    "uncertainties have been estimated following the algorithm described by snchez almeida ( 1997 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the standard covariance matrix , and @xmath3 is the number of free parameters .",
    "that is , errors are evaluated as the standard least - square estimate ( see , for instance , press et al 1988 ) , augmented by the square root of the ratio between the number of data and the number of free parameters . with this correction , uncertainties are reliable even in the case the minimum of @xmath15 has not been reached .",
    "we can make use of the previously studied solar case to estimate the boundaries of the depth coverage reached with the current set of spectral lines .",

    "( 1984 ) , with a higher signal - to - noise ratio and spectral resolution than our stellar spectra .",
    "the mcdonald day - light spectra were acquired with the same spectrograph and similar signal to noise as the stellar spectra , and provide the possibility to carry out a test of the results obtained with the mcdonald setup .",

    ". the smaller sample of lines narrows the photospheric region covered .",
    "nonetheless , the agreement is reasonable for @xmath18 , with differences smaller than 200 k suggesting that the ten selected spectral lines map approximately this part of the solar photosphere .      the derived model stellar photospheres are shown in fig . 3 , and compared with theoretical model photospheres from the grid by kurucz ( 1992 ) , and the exact solution to the gray atmosphere ( @xmath19 $ ] ) of the assigned effective temperatures ( see below ) .",
    "the quality of the final fit to the observed line spectra is shown in fig . 4 for the two stars .",
    "there are marked differences between the temperature stratification of the semi - empirical models and their purely theoretical counterparts . while the star s gravity is determined with high accuracy from the trigonometric parallaxes measured by hipparcos ( nissen , h@xmath20 g & schuster 1997 ; allende prieto et al .",
    "1999b ) and some additional hypotheses , the effective temperature typically gives discrepant values when derived from different methods such as photometry , balmer lines , excitation equilibrium , the spectral energy distribution , or temperature sensitive line ratios .",
    "we treat the effective temperature of the appropriate theoretical model as an unknown parameter .",
    "metallicity influences only weakly the considered spectral features .",
    "the derived rotational velocities are 2.5 and 2.1 km s@xmath8 for gmb1830 and @xmath0 eri , respectively .",
    "they compare well with those empirically measured by fekel ( 1997 ) : 2.2 and 2.0 km s@xmath8 .",
    "mayor and collaborators derived 1.5 km s@xmath8 for @xmath0 eri from the coravel measurements ( benz & mayor 1984 ) , while gray ( 1984 ) gives 2.2 km s@xmath8 .",

    "( 1992 ) derived 1.8 km s@xmath8 for the combination of the different broadening mechanisms : instrumental , macroturbulence and rotation .",
    "however , our rotational velocities should be taken with caution .",
    "the inversion code is not able to cleanly unravel the gaussian macroturbulence from the rotational broadening profile .",
    "moreover , the use of the van der waals approximation for the collisional broadening with neutral hydrogen is expected to underestimate , systematically , the collisional broadening , and should produce larger - than - real estimates for the rotation - macroturbulence broadening .",
    "the derived gaussian macroturbulence is 0.0 and 1.5 km s@xmath8 for gmb1830 and @xmath0 eri , respectively , and in both cases the preferred microturbulence was 0.6 km s@xmath8 .",
    "obviously , the abundances obtained directly from the inversion are only those of the elements whose lines are represented in the sample selected as input data .",
    "these are : calcium , titanium , chromium , and iron .",
    "the results appear in table 4 .",
    "the derived ratio of iron to calcium abundances for gmb1830 agrees very well with that found by smith et al .",

    "the comparison of the abundances of these elements in @xmath0 eri with the determination by drake & smith ( 1993 ) shows a discrepancy for calcium of @xmath21 dex ( a(ca ) = 6.26  6.39 ) . ] and a difference of 0.28 dex for iron : our result is [ fe / h ] = @xmath22 dex , and theirs was [ fe / h ] = @xmath23 .",
    "these and others inconsistencies found for @xmath0 eri ( see drake & smith ( 1993 ) and  5 of this paper ) might be partly related to the magnetic activity of the star .",
    "we have made use of several spectroscopic indicators to test the depth stratification of the stellar photosphere : the optical spectral energy distribution , weak metal lines spanning a wide range in excitation potential , and collisionally enhanced wings of strong metallic lines .",
    "the optical continuum and the excitation balance of weak metal lines are highly sensitive to temperature .",
    "the wings of the very few strong metal lines for which detailed theoretical calculations or laboratory measurements of their damping constants is available ( lambert 1993 ) are reliable estimators of the pressure in the line forming region ( see , e.g. , edvardsson 1988 , anstee , omara & ross 1997 ) .",
    "other tools are available , such as the wings of the balmer lines ( fuhrmann , axer & gehren 1993 ) , but have not been included here because they are more complicate to interpret .",
    "the reader is referred to fuhrmann et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for an extensive discussion on the analysis of hydrogen lines .",
    "while most of the spectrophotometric measurements in the literature do not provide an estimate of their accuracy , the availability of different * independent * determinations allows us to derive empirically their precision for the case of gmb1830 .",

    "the true continuum ( no line blanketing ) , given the low metallicity of the star , is expected to fall very close to the observed continuum , except in the blue part of the spectrum , where it should be higher , consistent with the presence of many absorption lines .",
    "the prediction of the miss model ( solid line ) shows this behavior .",
    "it is shown in the figure that , for the fixed gravity and metallicity ( @xmath25 = 4.68 ; [ fe / h ] = 1.3 ) , a theoretical model atmosphere with an effective temperature @xmath26 5050 k reproduces the observations .",
    "this was already pointed out by balachandran & carney ( 1996 ) .",
    "the fluxes for the theoretical ( kurucz 1992 ) models take into account the presence of lines ( unlike the miss continuum ) and are therefore directly comparable with the observations . the effective temperature derived from the optical continuum is consistent , as expected , with that recently derived by alonso , arribas , & martnez roger ( 1996 ) making use of the infrared flux method ( irfm ; blackwell et al . 1990 ) : 5029 k.    the absolutely calibrated uv spectra of gmb1830 in the iue final archive ( iuefa ) offer us the possibility to carry out an independent test . combining the apparent brightness of the star in the johnson v band , v = 6.42 , and the _ hipparcos _ parallax , @xmath27 = 0.109 mas , we arrive at an absolute magnitude for this star @xmath28 . using this value and the star s metallicity to choose an isochrone from @xmath29-elements enhanced models of bergbusch",
