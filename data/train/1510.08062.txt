    "approximately 1@xmath0 of nearby sun - like stars host short - period gas giant planets , known as  hot jupiters \" @xcite .",
    "standard models of planet formation suggest that hot jupiters are unlikely to have formed in situ , but must have formed beyond the ice line and migrated inward @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "proposed migration models include both planet - disk ( type ii ) interactions @xcite and dynamical models including kozai migration @xcite , planet - planet scattering @xcite , and secular chaos @xcite .",
    "while disk - driven migration is controlled primarily by local interactions , dynamical migration processes can be strongly affected by the presence of distant massive companions .",
    "in particular , the simplest variant of kozai migration requires a perturbing star @xcite , while planet - planet scattering can in principle be triggered by external perturbations @xcite . by studying the present - day properties of hot jupiter systems",
    ", we can distinguish between competing formation and migration channels .",
    "we generally expect that in isolation disk migration should produce hot jupiters on circular and well - aligned orbits , while dynamical migration simulations frequently result in planets with orbits that are eccentric and/or misaligned with respect to the star s spin axis .",
    "surveys of hot jupiter spin - orbit alignments indicate that approximately half of all hot jupiter systems are misaligned @xcite , suggesting that three - body dynamics may play an important role in these systems . on the other hand",
    ", the apparent paucity of high eccentricity gas giant planets at intermediate orbital periods suggest that less than half of all hot jupiters could have migrated via the star - planet kozai - lidov mechanism @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the presence of a stellar companion can also tilt the protoplanetary disk with respect to the stellar rotation axis , causing spin - orbit misalignments before planets have even formed @xcite .",
    "regardless of whether it is the disk or the planet orbit being tilted , both scenarios require the presence of a massive outer companion on a non - coplanar orbit ( albeit in different epochs ) in order to explain the present - day spin - orbit misalignments observed in a significant fraction of hot jupiter systems .",
    "although a majority of the extrasolar planets detected to date appear to orbit single stars , this is somewhat surprising as surveys of field stars indicate that approximately half of all sun - like stars in the solar neighborhood are found in binaries @xcite .",
    "it is unclear exactly what role a binary companion might play in the process of planet formation and migration .",
    "it has been suggested that wide separation binaries may warp or even truncate the outer edges of the protoplanetary disk and reduce average disk lifetimes ( e.g. , terquem & bertout 1993 ; pichardo et al .",
    "2005 ; kraus et al .",
    "2012 ; cheetham et al .",
    "dynamical interactions with a distant companion may increase turbulent velocities in the protoplanetary disk , thereby preventing materials from condensing @xcite . by searching for stellar companions to known planetary systems we can constrain their potential effects on these planetary systems , albeit with the caveat that close encounters between stars forming in crowded cluster environments may have similar effects ( e.g. , bonnell et al .",

    "previous surveys have identified a number of stellar companions in known planetary systems @xcite , but only a handful are close binaries with hot jupiters orbiting the primary star .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission has detected approximately a dozen circumbinary planets to date ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a number of adaptive optics ( ao ) surveys have proven to be effective at detecting more widely separated stellar companions ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a complete review of surveys prior to 2015 ) .",
    "the friends of hot jupiters ( fohj ) project systematically tests the validity of dynamical models of hot jupiter migration and performs a dedicated inquest on the stellar multiplicity rate of hot jupiter systems .",
    "we focus on a sample of nearby transiting hot jupiters with well - characterized spin - orbit alignments and orbital eccentricities , divided into a control group with circular , well - aligned orbits and an experimental group with eccentric and/or misaligned orbits .",
    "our approach differs from that of most previous surveys , which typically focused on either non - transiting planets or transiting planet candidates in the _ kepler _ sample , of which the vast majority are too small or too faint to detect the rossiter - mclaughlin effect and measure their corresponding spin - orbit misalignments ( e.g. , lillo - box 2012 ; adams et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "in @xcite we searched for long - term radial velocity accelerations due to distant planetary or stellar companions in these systems , and found that 51@xmath110@xmath0 of the stars in our sample hosted planetary mass companions with orbits between 1 - 20 au . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "we performed a complementary _ k _ band ao imaging search for stellar companions on relatively wide orbits , and found a binary rate of 48@xmath19@xmath0 for stellar companions with projected separations between 50 - 2000 au .",
    "this rate is approximately twice that of field stars having companions in this semi - major axis range @xcite , suggesting that stellar companions may play a role in the formation of these systems .",
    "although previous imaging studies hinted at a high stellar multiplicity rate for transiting planet host stars ( see ngo et al .",
    "2015 for a complete review ) , our study was the first to confirm that the imaged companions were gravitationally bound and to derive a completeness - corrected multiplicity rate for hot jupiter host stars .",
    "in both surveys there was no indication that eccentric or misaligned systems were more likely to have a massive outer companion than their circular and well - aligned counterparts .    in this study",

    "1998 ) to search for stellar companions that might have gone undetected in our ao and radial velocity observations .",
    "we use high - resolution _ k _ band spectroscopy to search for blended lines from cool stellar companions , exploiting the deep co molecular absorption features present in cool stars and distinct from the lines of the hotter primaries .",
    "we expect that these companions will have relatively small projected separations and/or high orbital inclinations , in order to be consistent with our previous radial velocity and ao observations of these systems . for systems in which we detect companions ,",
    "we can estimate their effective temperatures and place an upper limit on their projected separations from the primary .",

    "a similar technique is used to probe absorption lines in the atmospheres of hot jupiters , which exhibit rapidly varying velocity offsets @xcite . for cases where the hidden companion has a significantly different effective temperature than the target star ,",
    "@xcite were also able to detect companions with smaller radial velocity offsets .",
    "of the 1160 _ kepler _ stars with candidate transiting planets , sixty - three showed spectroscopic evidence for a companion star .",

    ", we create 34 two - star models , each with a different companion effective temperature ranging from 2300 to 5500 k. we assume all our companion stars have @xmath10 .",
    "we also assume our companion stars have the same radial veolcities as the primary stars because companions in short - period orbits would already have been detected in our radial velocity observations of the primary star .",
    "for example , a k - dwarf companion to a typical star in our survey with a random orbital orientation must on average be located beyond 10 au in order to avoid creating a detectable rv signal .",
    "at this separation , the companion star would have a rv offset of 6 km / s , corresponding to 0.4 pixels in our nirspec observations .",
    "this choice represents a departure from traditional spectroscopic binary analyses ( e.g. , zucker & mazeh 1994 ) , which allow for an arbitrary radial velocity offset between the two binary components .",
    "although our decision to fix the radial velocity offset between the two stars to zero precludes us from detecting chance blends with unassociated background or foreground stars , we note that such blends would need to have a differential magnitude less than 5.0 in order to be detectable and a separation of less than 0.4 `` in order to fall within our slit . in our ao survey of these stars we found that all candidate stellar companions with a differential k band magnitude less than 6.0 located within 5 '' of the primary were in fact bound companions ( see fig .",
    "4 in ngo et al . 2015 ) , and we therefore consider it unlikely that any chance blends would occur in our sample that meet the above criteria .",
    "we set @xmath5 $ ]  = 0 for our companion stars as the primary stars in these systems all have near - solar or solar metallicities .",
    "we evaluate the effect of metallicity on our models by re - running our fits to the most metal - rich star in our sample ( hat - p-13 , @xmath5 $ ]  = 0.46 @xmath1 0.07 ) , and find that our results are indistinguishable from those of stellar metallicity models .",
    "since cool stars typically have @xmath8 values less than 5 km / s , instrumental broadening will dominate and we fix the rotational broadening to zero for our cool star companion models .",
    "phoenix models are given in units of flux per unit surface area , and we multiply the spectra of the primary and companion stars by their respective areas in order to convert to total flux .",
    "we take the value for the radius of the primary star from the published literature , and we calculate the radius of the companion as a function of its effective temperature using the stellar evolution models of @xcite .",
    "we first fit the one - star model to the calibrated data , assuming constant errors at each wavelength bin .",
    "the wavelength solution ( described to third order as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is pixel number and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are free parameters ) and the width of the instrumental broadening kernel are left as free parameters when fitting each individual spectrum .",
    "we allow the instrumental broadening to vary across all orders and find that it remains roughly consistent throughout ( full - width half - maximum @xmath16 0.05 @xmath17 ) .",
    "the instrumental broadening kernel is assumed to be gaussian and represents the effect of poor seeing and the interaction of the starlight with the instrumental apparatus .",
    "the instrumental broadening varies from target to target according to the orientation of the telescope and the air mass of the observations .",
    "we find the best - fit model by minimizing @xmath18 and check that we have found the correct global minimum by repeating the calculation with different initial guesses in the parameter space .",
    "we then use the best - fit one - star model to determine empirical error bars for the data .",
    "these error bars are calculated as the standard deviation of each residual and its twenty nearest neighbors .",
    "this method of error calculation allows us to directly estimate the combined error due to the calibration , model fit , and photon noise contributions , many of which are difficult to predict a priori .",
    "we note that these empirically determined error values are only an approximation to the true error distribution ; our use of the @xmath18 metric implicitly assumes that each wavelength measurement is drawn from an independent gaussian distribution with a width @xmath19 determined by our empirical estimates .",
    "this is fundamentally an approximation and we therefore use the @xmath18 values from our fits as a metric of relative goodness - of - fit rather than an absolute measurement of the probability of a given model . with these new error bars , we refit the best - fit one - star model at the best - fitting grid point .",
    "we use the final best - fit parameters for the one - star model as the initial guess for fitting the two - star model . although we allow the instrumental broadening and wavelength solution to vary between the one and two - star models , we find consistent values between the two versions of the fit .",
    "we exclude the third order ( 2.155 - 2.185 @xmath20 m ) from our analysis , where we find that our telluric a star standards have a strong brackett gamma absorption line that propagates into our target spectra when applying our telluric correction .",
    "we plot the reduced chi - squared ( @xmath21 ) value for the two - star fit as a function of the stellar companion temperature and look for minima indicating the presence of a cool companion .",
    "the @xmath21 for the coolest stellar companions approaches that of the single - star fit , indicating that we are not sensitive to companions below a certain temperature , as shown in panels a - c of figure  [ nondetection ] .",
    "we also compare the one- and two - star fits using the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) , which is defined as : @xmath22 where @xmath18 is the canonical chi - squared value , @xmath23 is the number of free parameters , and @xmath24 is the number of data points . for our purposes ,",
    "n=4 for the one - star model , n=5 for the two - star model , and n = 4980 . in order",
    "to be classified as a detection , there must be a significant improvement in the @xmath21 and in the bic for the two - star model , and we must be able to verify the presence of absorption lines from the cool companion that are distinct from those of the primary ( i.e. , the code is not just improving the fit to a single star spectrum by overlaying a second nearly identical spectrum and better fitting to the measured line profiles ) .",
    "we find that in all cases the bic gives results that are equivalent to the @xmath21 approach .",
    "for the systems where we detect candidate stellar companions , we list the effective temperature of the cool companion that produces the largest improvement in @xmath21 over the one - star model . in some cases there",
    "is a broad minimum in @xmath21 for the two - star model centered on the effective temperature of the primary , which can create a slope that extends out to relatively low companion temperatures .",
    "we correct for the effect of this slope in cases where we detect a candidate stellar companion at lower temperatures by interpolating the slope across the region spanned by the minimum due to the companion and subtracting the interpolated trend .",
    "the endpoints for this interpolated line are chosen by finding the locations on either side of the local reduced chi - squared minimum having slopes equal to within 10% .",
    "our wavelength - dependent measurement errors are determined empirically from the data themselves and we expect them to be dominated by systematic errors due to imperfect corrections for telluric absorption and in our stellar models . as a result , there is no formal metric for determining whether or not a detection is statistically significant , and we therefore rank - order our detections from strongest to weakest according to the depth of the minimum in @xmath21 .",
    "fitting our data with this same procedure , but with uniform error bars , gives the same final sets of detections and non - detections , with only slight variations in detection strengths and companion effective temperatures .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties on the effective temperatures of the candidate stellar companions using two methods .",
    "we first calculated the range in effective temperature corresponding to a 1@xmath19 change in our best - fit @xmath18 value , but found that this method produced unrealistically small error bars with a typical size of 120 k. we instead adopted a more conservative method in which we calculate the range in effective temperature corresponding to a change in @xmath21 equal to half the total difference between the one- and two - star models at the best - fit companion temperature .",
    "we find typical uncertainties of 250 k using this method , as shown in table  [ detection ] .",
    "figure  [ spectrum ] shows the best - fit one - star and two - star models for wasp-2 in yellow and red , respectively .",
    "we evaluate our sensitivity to cool stellar companions in individual systems with non - detections by injecting synthetic companions into our data and determining the lowest effective temperature for which we can reliably detect the injected companion . in doing so",
    ", we characterize our dispositive null detections , where our lack of detection implies that there is no companion in a specific temperature and semi - major axis range in that system .",

    "the corrected companion fraction for the subset of planets with misaligned and/or eccentric orbits is @xmath87 , and for well - aligned planets on circular orbits is @xmath88 .",
    "these occurrence rates are consistent with one another and suggest that there is no obvious preference for misaligned hot jupiter systems to have stellar companions drawn from the ao sample .",
    "we next consider whether or not the candidate companions detected in this survey might be a field star population of intermediate - period companions located too close in to be detectable in ao images and too far out to be detected with with radial velocity monitoring .",
    "we calculate the sensitivity of our survey to this population by simulating @xmath89 binary companions with orbital elements and mass ratio distributions drawn from @xcite .",
    "we only consider systems with periods less than @xmath90 days ( i.e. , interior to our cutoff for the ao survey ) and those which do not create detectible rv trends . in our formulation ,",
    "a binary system has no detectable rv trend if the following criterion is satisfied : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the mass and semi - major axis of the simulated binary companion and @xmath94 is the angle from face - on , as in equation  [ semiamplitude ] .",
    "@xmath95 is the rv trend slope measured for system @xmath72 in  @xcite and @xmath96 is the error on that measurement .    for this population",
    ", we find that our average survey sensitivity is @xmath97 with a standard deviation of @xmath98 .",
    "this corresponds to a completeness - corrected companion fraction @xmath99 for the total sample , @xmath100 for the misaligned sample , and @xmath101 for the control sample .",
    "as before , we conclude that there is no detectable correlation between the presence of a stellar companion and the orbital properties of the transiting gas giant planet .",
    "we find that stellar companions that meet these two criterion typically have semi - major axes between 0.4 - 12.1 au . of field stars surveyed by @xcite , @xmath102 had companions in this semi - major axis range .",
    "we therefore conclude that , if these companions are drawn from a unique imtermediate period sample , our upper limit on the companion fraction for this population is consistent with the rates for field stars with comparable separations .",
    "we perform a spectroscopic search of fifty hot jupiter host stars in order to search for blended lines due to cool stellar companions with projected separations of less than 0.4  .",
    "we detect eight candidate companions having effective temperatures ranging from 3500 - 4000 k. this method is complementary to our previous ao imaging survey of these same systems , which was sensitive to companions with projected separations larger than 0.4 - 0.5  . it also allows us to determine whether or not any of the radial velocity trends in these systems might be due to high inclination stellar binaries as opposed to planetary or brown dwarf companions . our detection sensitivity and corrected companion fractions are consistent with a scenario in which all of the observed companions are located at larger orbital separations consistent with the population of companions detected in our previous ao survey .",
    "our results are also consistent with a scenario in which the observed companions are located at intermediate separations ( 0.4 - 12 au ) with a frequency comparable to that of field stars .",
    "regardless of the underlying population model , we find no evidence for a correlation between the presence of a spectroscopic stellar companions and the spin - orbit misalignment or orbital eccentricity of the transiting gas giant planets in these systems .",
    "other surveys have suggested that misaligned hot jupiters preferentially orbit stars having @xmath3@xmath34 6200 k @xcite .",
    "we note that hot stars also have higher intrinsic binary fractions ( e.g. , duchene & kraus 2013 ) , which might lead to a spurious correlation between spin - orbit alignment and stellar multiplicity if most of our misaligned planets are located preferentially around hot stars .",
    "we selected our sample of well - aligned planets on circular orbits to have approximately the same distribution of stellar masses as our sample of misaligned and/or eccentric planets ( see section 2.1 of @xcite ) in order to ensure that this was not an issue .",
    "we also note that this study identifies only one system with @xmath3@xmath34 6200 k containing a candidate companion , providing additional confirmation that our results are unaffected by this correlation .",
    "other studies have suggested that tides can remove non - zero obliquities for planets orbiting stars cooler than 6200 k @xcite , although planets orbiting hotter stars with less efficient tides should still retain their primordial spin - orbit alignments . in ngo",
    "2015 ) we addressed this issue by repeating our spin - orbit alignment correlation test for the subset of stars hotter than 6200 k , and found no evidence for a correlation between spin - orbit alignment and stellar multiplicity . although we could in theory repeat this analysis with our new sample of candidate companions , in practice we are limited in this case by the small number of companions detected in this survey .",
    "if misaligned orbits are instead the results of a primordial misalignment in the protoplanetary disk @xcite , the stellar companions responsible for the misalignment might have been lost to dissolution or exchange in the cluster , therefore weakening the observed correlation between spin - orbit misalignment and the presence of a stellar companion at the current epoch . finally , there would be no correlation between companion stars and misaligned planets if misalignment were caused by magnetic torque @xcite or turbulent accretion @xcite , neither of which require the presence of a stellar companion .",
    "although our data appear to be consistent with this hypothesis , these models are unable to reproduce the observed obliquity distribution for short - period gas giant planets @xcite .",
    "an independent confirmation of these spectroscopic detections would allow us to reliably calculate the statistical significance of our spectroscopic detections and to combine the results of this study with our previous rv and ao surveys in order to provide an improved estimate of the stellar multiplicity rate for these systems .",
    "as shown in @xcite , combined direct imaging and spectroscopic surveys provide an unparalleled look at the properties of stellar companions in these systems . in the future we plan to obtain high - contrast imaging follow - up observations using angular differential imaging on nirc2 at keck @xcite and the differential speckle survey instrument at gemini observatory @xcite , which will achieve better constrasts at small separations than our previous _",
    "k _ band ao images with nirc2 .",
    "because our candidate spectroscopic companions have negligible radial velocity offsets from the primary and are not typically detected by long - term radial velocity monitoring of the host star , we conclude that they are unlikely to have very small orbital separations and therefore should be resolvable with improved high - contrast imaging . in systems where we are able to directly resolve the candidate",
