    "this article concerns the local behavior of semi - linear elliptic equation @xmath0 with either neumann boundary condition @xmath1 or dirichlet boundary value problem @xmath2 the solution of equations ( [ or ] ) are the steady states of both heat transferring problem and the standing wave of sound propagation . for heat transferring problem ,",
    "the maximum of the solution is expected to occur at the boundary .",
    "this problem was proposed by rauch @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of this problem is not necessary true for standing wave problem .",
    "in fact , the counter example below looks more like a standing wave solution than the solution of heat transferring problem .",
    "perhaps this is the reason why that there are many counter examples as @xcite and example 1 of this article .",
    "after @xcite , this problem then adjusted to consider over convex domain .",
    "for nonlinear problem , similar behavior of the solution is called spike layer @xcite .",
    "spike layer problem attracts many research attentions , for example @xcite . in this article ,",
    "the location of the maximum of the solution of neumann boundary value and the uniqueness of local extrema of dirichlet boundary value problem are studied .",
    "example 1 is the counter example of both the hot spot problem and the inheritance of convexity of positive solution .",
    "it was believed that the positive solution of dirichlet boundary value problem of equation ( [ or ] ) will inherit the convexity of the domain .",
    "however , counter examples were found by koreeva @xcite , cabr and chanillo @xcite and hamel et al . @xcite over convex domain .",
    "thus , instead of studying the inheritance of convexity of the solution of elliptic equation , the uniqueness of local maximum of the solution will be considered in this article .",
    "although the condition of the solution that preserve convexity of domain remains unknown , the condition of positive solution to have a unique local maximum is obtained .    at first glance ,",
    "these two problems seem to be irrelevant because their boundary conditions are different although they share the same equation .",
    "however , the behavior of these two solutions of the contrary proposition of the corresponding problems s similar .",
    "for dirichlet boundary condition problem , the level curves should be a closed curves unless there are more then one isolated critical points that imply the existence of saddle point .",
    "on the other hand , the level curves of the solution of neumann boundary condition should be orthogonal to the boundary or the boundary itself is a collection of critical points . excluding the boundary being a collection of critical points , the level curves of neumann boundary condition should not form a closed curves inside the domain unless there exists some other isolated critical point in the interior of the domain that implies the existence of saddle point .",
    "thus , to derive the right condition of these problems , it is necessary to classify the critical point .",
    "the common method of classification critical points refers to hessian matrix .",
    "unfortunately , the solution of a differential equation is not a definite function therefore it is not possible to adept the hessian matrix to it . to this end ,",
    "a new testing method is introduced which involves the following definitions of critical points .",
    "an isolated critical point @xmath3 of function @xmath4 is a local maximum ( minimum ) if for any @xmath5 , there exists a @xmath6 such that @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 for @xmath10 ; otherwise , @xmath3 is a saddle point .    if @xmath11 is a simply connected component of level curve @xmath12 and @xmath13 for all @xmath14 then @xmath15 is called a non - isolated critical point of function @xmath4 .    if @xmath3 is a local maximum of solution @xmath4 of equation ( [ or ] ) then @xmath16 . to see this , we integrate equation ( [ or ] ) over @xmath17 and it yields , @xmath18",
    "since @xmath3 is a local maximum and the outward normal @xmath19 along @xmath20 , it gives @xmath21 . if @xmath22 then @xmath23 .",
    "notice that , @xmath24 is arbitrary , therefore @xmath16 and hence the following conclusion is derived .",
    "if @xmath3 is a local maximum ( minimum ) of the solution @xmath4 of ( [ or ] ) then @xmath16 @xmath25 .",
    "notice that definition 1 and 2 can be applied to classify the degenerate critical point such as @xmath26 of @xmath27 or the critical points at the boundary of the domain .    before discussing the main issues",
    ", a counter example will be given first .",
    "the counter example is constructed over disks because disk posses both convex and symmetry properties .",
    "thus if the counter example of these problems were found over disk then it seems that other kinds of necessary conditions are needed so that these conjectures hold .",
    "in fact , lemma 5 and the counter example below seem to suggest that the nonlinearity of reaction term is the key to solve these two problems . for instance , the power @xmath28 of the nonlinear reaction term of counter example satisfies @xmath29 ; however , the condition of lemma 5 ( pohozeav s identity ) says that if @xmath30 then @xmath31 . on the other hand , if @xmath32 then ( [ or ] ) turns to eigen - value problem and the location of hot spot of eigen - function depends on the domain .",
    "@xmath33 , which is the symmetry solution over domain @xmath34 of equation ( [ sym ] ) below , where @xmath35 is the ball of radius @xmath36 centered at point @xmath3 where    @xmath37    and its graph is as follows :        if domain @xmath38 then @xmath4 satisfies neumann boundary condition and all points of the boundary are maximum of @xmath4 which does agree with hot spot conjecture . however , if @xmath39 then @xmath4 satisfies both neumann and dirichlet boundary condition ; moreover , @xmath4 is positive but not convex and still @xmath40 along @xmath41 .",
    "thus @xmath4 conflicts with both hot spot of heat transferring on convex domain and the inheritance of convexity of positive solution .    in this article",
    ", we use @xmath12 to denote the level curves of a function .",
    "however , it is possible that the level curves contains more than one components . therefore , we use @xmath42 to denote the simply connected component of @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath43 may be a singleton @xmath44 , if @xmath45 is a local extrema .",
    "throughout this article we assume that @xmath46 is a smooth open bounded simply connected convex domain of @xmath47 satisfying interior spherical condition and @xmath48 is monotone with respect to @xmath4 or @xmath49 . as usual , we say that @xmath46 is smooth if @xmath50 is smooth .",
    "@xmath51 is the closure of domain @xmath46 and @xmath52 is the interior of @xmath46 .",
    "we shall note that all proofs of this article are dimensionless ; therefore , all results are expected to be true for higher dimension @xmath53 .    in the proof",
    "below , it involves with the critical point at boundary ; therefore , we introduce the following notations @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 without ambiguity , @xmath22 and @xmath57 if and only if @xmath58 where @xmath59 . in particular , if @xmath22 but @xmath60 remains constant sign , for all @xmath59 , then we still say that @xmath3 is a local extrema .      from neumann boundary condition , we have a natural constraint : @xmath61 therefore @xmath62 must change its sign , say at @xmath63 . as usual , we let @xmath64 .",
    "the assumption @xmath49 implies that @xmath65 concaves upward with respect to @xmath66 and hence @xmath63 is the absolute minimum of @xmath67 . to explore the behavior of solution @xmath4 of neumann boundary value problem , we denote @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 .            to derive the results",
    ", we apply phozeav identity locally . multiplying @xmath60 to equation ( [ or ] ) and integrating over @xmath77",
    ", it yields @xmath78 replacing @xmath79 by @xmath62 , the left hand side of ( [ 5 ] ) yields @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 calculating the right hand side of ( [ 5 ] ) and by @xmath83 it yields @xmath84 replacing @xmath85 by @xmath86 and then adding all together , we get @xmath87 let @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . if @xmath22 then @xmath92 otherwise it is an empty set .",
    "along @xmath93 , @xmath94 is parallel to the tangent of the curve therefore @xmath95 . on the other hand , @xmath96 over @xmath77 therefore @xmath97 .",
    "along @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath96 therefore @xmath97 . along @xmath46 , @xmath23 ( @xmath100 for dirichlet boundary value problem ) and",
    "@xmath101 . since @xmath102 , ( [ 9 ] ) yields @xmath103 every terms on the right hand side of equation ( [ 10 ] ) are negative , a contradiction",
    ". therefore @xmath3 must be a local extrema .",
    "the proof is completed .    from the conclusion of lemma 5 and implicit function theorem ,",
    "the level curves of @xmath4 are either the union of disjoint simply connected smooth curves or singletons .",
    "thus we have the following conclusion .      if hypothesis ( a ) holds , @xmath104 , and if @xmath107 contains only one component then @xmath108 , @xmath109 along @xmath110 and there exists a unique @xmath111 such that @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "if on the contrary @xmath114 then the sign of @xmath62 along @xmath50 remains constant . if @xmath115 then @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the unit tangent vector at @xmath15 along @xmath50 .",
    "thus @xmath13 which contradicts lemma 5 .",
    "hence @xmath4 can not be a constant along @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath118 and @xmath119 then by proposition 4 , @xmath120 , a contradiction .",
    "thus @xmath114 . by lemma 5 ,",
    "@xmath109 along @xmath110 .    to prove the uniqueness of local maximum along @xmath121",
    ", we let @xmath122 such that @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath124 be the arc containing all the points lie in between @xmath125 . by mean value theorem",
    ", there exists at least a critical point @xmath126 lies in between @xmath125 . by lemma 5 , @xmath126 can not be a saddle point .",
    "therefore @xmath126 is a local minimum which contradicts proposition 4 .    if the condition @xmath127 may relax to @xmath128 but with assumption @xmath129 only when @xmath130 , then lemma 5 still holds .",
    "thus @xmath4 contains interior maximum provided that @xmath110 contains more than one component .",
    "lemma 5 is a local property of the solution of equation ( [ or ] ) therefore it remains true for dirichlet boundary value problem . with the conclusion of lemma 5 and mean value theorem",
    ", we may derive that the positive solution of ( [ or ] ) has a unique local maximum provided that the domain is convex . from the proof of lemma 5",
    ", we see that the necessary condition of it is that @xmath104 .",
    "the positiveness of the solution and the conditions @xmath49 and @xmath131 for @xmath132 imply that @xmath127 over @xmath52 .",
    "thus the following conclusion holds .",
    "if @xmath3 , @xmath134 are both local maximum of @xmath4 then by mean value theorem there must another critical point @xmath126 which is either a saddle or a local minimum .",
    "if @xmath135 then @xmath126 can not be a local minimum because @xmath136 which contradicts proposition 4 .",
    "@xmath126 can not be a saddle because that will contradict lemma 5 .",
    "next , if @xmath137 and if it is a saddle or local minimum then there is a subset @xmath138 such that @xmath139 , if @xmath140 , which contradicts lemma 5 .",
    "thus the interior local extrema is unique .",
    "the proof is completed .    * remark 9 . * the assumptions",
    "@xmath141 and @xmath127 of hypothesis ( a ) indicate that if @xmath142 then @xmath143 which coincides with counter example 1 . the condition @xmath49 does fit the first non - constant eigenfunction of laplacian with neumann boundary condition .",
    "however , excluding the constant eigenfunction , the second non - constant eigenfunction @xmath144 on @xmath145 \\times[0 , 2\\pi]$ ] has an interior critical point and level curve @xmath146 contains two components .",
    "therefore , the location of the local extrema seems not only depends on the convexity of the domain but the structure of the level curve of @xmath63 as well .",
