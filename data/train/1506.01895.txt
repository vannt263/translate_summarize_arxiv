    "a classical way of presenting certain closed orientable @xmath0-manifolds is by taking cyclic covers of @xmath1 branched along knots .",
    "this article deals with the question of understanding in how many ways a given manifold can be presented as the total space of a cyclic branched cover of some knot .",
    "given a closed orientable @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 , these different presentations are in one - to - one correspondence with conjugacy classes of the corresponding groups of deck transformations .",
    "these are finite cyclic groups generated by periodic diffeomorphisms with connected and non - empty fixed - point set , and orbit space homeomorphic to the @xmath0-sphere .",
    "we call such diffeomorphisms _ hyperelliptic rotations_.    for example , the @xmath0-sphere is the @xmath3-fold cyclic branched cover of the trivial knot for any integer @xmath4 . on the other hand , due to the orbifold theorem , it is known that for a closed @xmath0-manifold which is not homeomorphic to @xmath1 , the order of a hyperelliptic rotation is bounded by a constant depending on the manifold , see @xcite .",
    "so when @xmath2 is not the @xmath0-sphere @xmath1 one may ask whether there is a universal upper bound for the number of distinct conjugacy classes of groups of deck transformations associated to cyclic branched covers .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case if the manifold is hyperbolic . for the general case of irreducible manifolds",
    "we obtain a universal bound only for the groups of deck transformations that have odd prime order .",
    "establishing such a universal upper bound for hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds boils down to bounding the number of conjugacy classes of cyclic groups of isometries generated by hyperelliptic rotations inside the finite group of isometries of the manifold . since any finite group acts on some hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold @xcite",
    ", @xcite we have to consider any finite group action on a @xmath0-manifold .",
    "the proof , however , only uses that the manifold is not @xmath1 , so our main result is the following    [ th : main4 ] let @xmath2 be a closed orientable connected @xmath0-manifold which is not homeomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a finite group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath5 contains at most six conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups generated by a hyperelliptic rotation of order not a power of @xmath6 .    thanks to previous work of one of the authors ( @xcite ) and of m. reni ( @xcite ) on hyperelliptic rotations of orders a power of @xmath6 ( see section  [ sec : generalization ] , theorem  [ th : powers of two ] ) , we deduce :    [ cor:4bis ] let @xmath2 be a closed orientable connected @xmath0-manifold which is not homeomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a finite group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath5 contains at most fifteen conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups generated by a hyperelliptic rotation .",
    "moreover , the set of orders of such subgroups has cardinality at most nine .",
    "the above corollary applies in particular to the orientation preserving group of isometries @xmath7 of a closed hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 which is finite .",
    "since any finite group of orientation preserving diffemorphisms acting on @xmath2 is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath7 , the following is a direct consequence of corollary  [ cor:4bis ]    [ cor : hyperbolic ] a closed orientable connected hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 is a cyclic cover of @xmath1 along a knot for at most fifteen distinct knots .",
    "the possible branching orders are at most nine .    from corollary  [ cor:4bis ]",
    "it is also possible to derive a characterisation of the @xmath0-sphere :    [ cor : char1 ] a closed , connected , orientable @xmath0-manifold @xmath2 is homeomorphic to @xmath1 if and only if there is a finite goup @xmath5 of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath2 such that @xmath5 contains sixteen conjugacy classes of subgroups generated by hyperelliptic rotations .",
    "one interesting aspect of the proof of theorem  [ th : main4 ] is the substantial use of finite group theory and the classification of finite simple groups . in particular",
    ", it relies on previous works on finite groups acting on @xmath0-manifolds by two of the authors in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a crucial point is to control the rank of the @xmath8-sylow subgroup of a finite group acting on a @xmath0-manifold .",
    "more precisely , the proof of theorem  [ th : main4 ] splits into various cases , according to the structures of the normalisers of the sylow @xmath8-subgroups containing an element of order @xmath8 that is a power of a hyperelliptic rotation , where @xmath8 is an odd prime number .",
    "this structure is reflected in the symmetry group of the branching knot in the quotient @xmath1 of the manifold by the action of the hyperelliptic rotation , see proposition  [ prop : symmetries and normalizer ] in section  [ sec : rotations ] .",
    "note that , although the proof of theorem  [ th : main4 ] uses the classification of finite simple groups , it is enough to know that there is only a finite number of sporadic simple groups ( that is , groups that are not alternating or of lie type ) to conclude on the existence of a uniform bound on the number of conjugacy classes . since",
    ", as we have already observed , every finite group acts on some closed orientable @xmath0-manifold ( see also section  [ sec : nonfree ] ) there is no way to avoid relying on the classification of finite simple groups to prove the above results .",
    "if we only consider @xmath0-manifolds that are @xmath9-homology spheres though , the proof of theorem  [ th : main4 ] ( with the very same bounds ) only relies on the gorenstein - harada classification of simple groups with sectional @xmath6-rank @xmath10 , @xcite , see corollary  [ cor : z2spheres ] .",
    "indeed , the homological condition provides control on the size of the sylow @xmath6-subgroups of finite groups that can act on such manifolds . for other topological conditions that impose constraints on the finite groups that can act on a manifold",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it follows from the proof of theorem  [ th : main4 ] that the existence of at least four distinct conjugacy classes of hyperelliptic rotations of orders not powers of @xmath6 in a finite group @xmath5 of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of a closed @xmath0-manifold imposes constraints on the structure of @xmath5 .",

    "our examples are not rational homology spheres , while the primeness assumption for the orders of the hyperelliptic rotations forces the manifold @xmath2 to be a rational homology sphere , see remark  [ rem : coverings ] in section  [ sec : rotations ] .",
    "_ arbitrary @xmath0-manifolds _    using the decomposition of a closed orientable connected @xmath0-manifold as a connected sum of prime manifolds , we deduce from theorem  [ th : knots ] an upper bound on the number of odd primes that can occur as orders of hyperelliptic rotations of arbitrary closed @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "remark that for any @xmath11 and every odd prime @xmath8 there are non prime @xmath0-manifolds that are the @xmath8-fold cyclic covers of at least @xmath12 non equivalent knots , so that theorem  [ th : knots ] does not generalise to arbitrary manifolds .",

    "in @xcite three of the authors showed that the upper bound is @xmath0 for the number of odd prime orders of hyperelliptic rotations acting on an integral homology sphere . in that case",

    "we do not know if the bound of corollary  [ th : main ] is sharp .",

    "the reduction of the proof relies basically on the fact that the sylow @xmath8-subgroup containing a non - trivial power of a hyperelliptic rotation has the same structure as that of a sylow @xmath8-subgroup containing a hyperelliptic rotation of order @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , all the key ingredients and essential difficulties are already encountered in the proof of theorem  [ th : main3 ] . in this section",

    "the key points to reduce the proof of theorem  [ th : main4 ] to that of theorem  [ th : main3 ] are the following :    1 .",
    "as explained in subsection  [ subsec : arbitrary - order ] , if @xmath43 is a hyperelliptic rotation in @xmath5 and @xmath8 is an odd prime dividing the order of @xmath43 , then a sylow @xmath8-subgroup of @xmath5 has the same algebraic properties as a sylow @xmath8-subgroup where @xmath8 is hyperelliptic .",
    "these properties are all that is needed in the proof of theorem  [ th : main3 ] .",
    "if @xmath43 itself has order @xmath8 and the sylow @xmath8-subgroup has rank @xmath6 , then exactly two cyclic groups generated by a rotation of order @xmath8 are contained in that sylow @xmath8-subgroup . in the general case , that is , when @xmath45 belongs to the sylow @xmath8-subgroup , this is not true anymore but we have at most two cyclic groups of order @xmath8 generated by elements with non - empty fixed - point sets , according to lemma  [ lem:2hyprot ] .",
    "we remark that if two hyperelliptic rotations have a common non - trivial power , then their fixed - point sets coincide and , by lemma  [ lem : commuting powers suffice ] , they generate the same cyclic group .",
    "this implies also that if two non - trivial powers of two hyperelliptic rotations are conjugate , then so are the subgroups generated by the two rotations .",
    "as noted in remark  [ rem : otherwise ] we know that proposition  [ prop : quotient action ] holds also in the general case . in the general case",
    "the subgroup @xmath164 can be replaced by the maximal normal solvable subgroup of odd order coprime with any prime that divides the order of a hyperelliptic rotation and @xmath165 can be replaced by the maximal normal solvable subgroup of order coprime with any odd prime that divides the order of a hyperelliptic rotation .",
    "4 .   theorem  [ th : solvable ] and proposition  [ prop : commuting rotations ] ensure that there are at most three commuting cyclic subgroups of hyperelliptic rotations of order not a power of @xmath6 , also in this setting .",
    "thus we can exploit the strategy to cover the group with solvable groups in the general case , too , and the results of section  [ sec : nonselfsym ] hold .",
    "5 .   in section",
    "[ sec : thm3 ] the proof is based essentially on the algebraic structure of the sylow @xmath8-subgroups when @xmath8 is hyperelliptic , so the arguments apply to cover the case of hyperelliptic rotations of order not a power of @xmath6 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that items 1 . and 2 .",
    "above imply that if @xmath5 is a finite group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms acting on a manifold @xmath36 then , for any odd prime @xmath8 , the cyclic subgroups generated by hyperelliptic rotations whose orders are divisible by @xmath8 belong to at most two different conjugacy classes .",

    "assume that @xmath5 contains at least four conjugacy classes of hyperelliptic rotations whose orders are not powers of @xmath6 .",
    "then , there is a solvable normal subgroup @xmath60 of @xmath5 such that :    * the layer @xmath177 has at most two components , which implies that so does @xmath5 ; * if the layer @xmath177 has two components , then @xmath446 .    moreover ,",
    "if @xmath129 is not a subgroup of @xmath229 , then any odd prime dividing the order of a hyperelliptic rotation does not divide the order of @xmath60 .",
    "the case of hyperelliptic rotations of order a power of @xmath6 is considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we remark that , if a manifold admits a hyperelliptic rotation of order @xmath447 , then the manifold is a @xmath34-homology sphere ( see  @xcite ) . combining the results in @xcite and @xcite",

    "in this short section we shall discuss finite groups of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms generated by hyperelliptic rotations and acting on reducible manifolds .",
    "we shall see that theorem  [ th : main3 ] is trivially fulfilled in this setting .",
    "the proof we give in the general case works also for the reducible one but here the situation is much simpler and is described by the following proposition .",
    "[ pro : reducible ] let @xmath2 be a reducible manifold and let @xmath29 be a finite group generated by at least two hyperelliptic rotations with distinct orders .",
    "in this case @xmath5 is isomorphic to a finite subgroup of @xmath448 , and thus , up to conjugacy , @xmath5 contains at most three cyclic groups generated by hyperelliptic rotations .",
    "since @xmath5 is a finite group , we can assume that it acts by isometries with respect to some riemannian metric on @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , by the equivariant sphere theorem , we can assume that there is a prime decomposition of @xmath2 into irreducible components which is @xmath5-equivariant .",
    "note that each hyperelliptic rotation must fix setwise each sphere of the decomposition since the space of orbits is @xmath1 , hence so must @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath5 acts by isometries , its action is determined by the action on any sphere of the decomposition .",
    "it follows that @xmath5 is conjugate to a finite subgroup of @xmath448 , that is cyclic , dihedral or a spherical triangular group .",
    "in this section we will show that every finite group @xmath5 admits a faithful action by orientation preserving diffeomorphisms on some rational homology sphere so that some elements of @xmath5 have non - empty fixed - point sets .",
    "cooper and long s construction of @xmath5-actions on rational homolgy spheres in @xcite consists in starting with a @xmath5-action on some @xmath0-manifold and then modifying the original manifold , notably by dehn surgery , so that the new manifold inherits a @xmath5-action but has  smaller \" rational homology .",
    "since their construction does not require that the @xmath5-action is free , it can be used to prove the existence of non - free @xmath5-actions .",
    "we will thus start by exhibiting non - free @xmath5-actions on some @xmath0-manifold before pointing out what need to be taken into account in this setting in order for cooper and long s construction to work .",

    "consider the free group of rank @xmath12 that we wish to see as the fundamental group of a @xmath616-punctured @xmath6-sphere : each generator @xmath617 corresponds to a loop around a puncture of the sphere so that a loop around the @xmath618st puncture corresponds to the element @xmath619 .",
    "build an orbifold @xmath620 by compactifying the punctured - sphere with cone points so that the @xmath364th puncture becomes a cone point of order @xmath621 .",
    "the resulting orbifold has ( orbifold ) fundamental group with the following presentation : @xmath622 clearly this group surjects onto @xmath5 .",
