    "starting with the seminal papers by lighthill , witham , and richards @xcite , traffic flow on a single road has been modeled in terms of a scalar conservation law : _",
    "t+(v())_x  =  0.here @xmath0 is the density of cars , while @xmath1 is their velocity , which we assume depends of the density alone . to describe traffic flow on an entire network of roads , one needs to further introduce a set of boundary conditions at road junctions @xcite .",
    "these conditions should relate the traffic densities on incoming roads @xmath2 and outgoing roads @xmath3 , depending on two main parameters :    driver s turning preferences . for every @xmath4",
    ", one should specify the fraction @xmath5 $ ] of drivers arriving to from the @xmath6-th road , who wish to turn into the @xmath7-th road .",
    "relative priorities assigned to different incoming roads . if the intersection is congested , these describe the maximum influx of cars arriving from each road @xmath8 , allowed to cross the intersection .",
    "various junction models of have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a survey .",
    "a convenient approach is to introduce a _ riemann solver _ ,",
    "i.e.  a rule that specifies how to construct the solution in the special case where the initial data is constant on every incoming and each outgoing road .",
    "as shown in @xcite , as soon as a riemann solver is given , the general cauchy problem for traffic flow near a junction can be uniquely solved ( under suitable assumptions ) .",
    "the recent counterexamples in @xcite show that , on a network of roads , in general the cauchy problem can be ill posed .",
    "indeed , two distinct solutions can be constructed for the same measurable initial data . on a network with several nodes",
    ", nonuniqueness can occur even if the initial data have small total variation .",
    "to readdress this situation , in @xcite an alternative intersection model was proposed , introducing a buffer of limited capacity at each road junction . for this new model , given any @xmath9 initial data , the cauchy problem has a unique solution , which is robust w.r.t .",
    "perturbations of the data .",
    "indeed , one has continuous dependence even w.r.t .",
    "the topology of weak convergence .",
    "a natural question , addressed in the present paper , is what happens in the limit as the size of the buffer approaches zero . for riemann initial data , constant along each incoming and outgoing road ,",
    "we show that this limit is described by a _",
    "limit riemann solver _ ( lrs ) which can be explicitly determined .",
    "see ( [ bbf])([of ] ) in section  2 .",
    "we recall that , in a model without buffer , the initial conditions consist of the constant densities @xmath10 on all incoming and outgoing roads @xmath11 , together with the drivers turning preferences @xmath12 . on the other hand , in the model with buffer , these initial conditions comprise also the length of the queues @xmath13 , @xmath14 , inside the buffer .",
    "one can think of @xmath15 as the number of cars already inside the intersection ( say , a traffic circle ) at time @xmath16 , waiting to access the outgoing road @xmath7 .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .    for",
    "any given riemann data @xmath17 , one can choose initial queue sizes @xmath13 such that , for all @xmath18 the solution of the problem with buffer is exactly the same as the solution determined by the riemann solver ( lrs ) .",
    "for any riemann data @xmath17 , and any initial queue sizes @xmath13 , as @xmath19 the solution of the problem with buffer approaches asymptotically the solution determined by the riemann solver ( lrs ) .",
    "using the fact that the conservation laws ( [ lwr ] ) are invariant under space and time rescalings , from ( ii ) we obtain a convergence result as the size of the buffer approaches zero .",
    "our present results apply only to solutions of the riemann problem , i.e.  with traffic density which is initially constant along each road .",
    "indeed , for a general cauchy problem the counterexamples in @xcite remain valid also for the riemann solver ( lrs ) , showing that the initial - value problem with measurable initial data can be ill posed .",
    "hence no convergence result can be expected .",
    "this should not appear as a paradox : for every positive size of the buffer , the cauchy problem has a unique solution , depending continuously on the initial data .",
    "however , as the size of the buffer approaches zero , the solution can become more and more sensitive to small changes in the initial conditions . in the limit",
    ", uniqueness is lost .",
    "an extension of our results may be possible in the case of initial data with bounded variation , for a network containing one single node . in view of the results in @xcite",
    ", we conjecture that in this case the solution to the cauchy problem with buffer converges to the solution determined by the riemann solver ( lrs ) . v",

    "indices @xmath21 denote _ incoming roads _ , while indices @xmath22 denote _ outgoing roads_. on the @xmath23-th road , the density of cars @xmath24 is governed by the scalar conservation law _",

    "these provide additional constraints on the limiting values of the vehicle densities |_k(t )  _ x0 _ k(t , x)k=1 ,  , m+nnear the intersection . in a realistic model",
    ", these boundary conditions should depend on :    * relative priority given to incoming roads .",
