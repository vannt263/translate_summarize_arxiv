    "in reference @xcite we investigated the solitary waves that arise in a deformed @xmath0 linear sigma model .",
    "these non - linear waves appear as kink defects when the system is considered in a @xmath1-dimensional space - time .",
    "the research performed in @xcite was based on study of the hamilton - jacobi equation of the mechanical analogue system that follows when time - independent field configurations are considered .",
    "interest in this model was explained in our previous work @xcite , and the physical meaning of the kinks was also discussed .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to gain a better understanding of the nature of such a rich variety of kinks .",
    "we shall focus on three important aspects :    i. in order to clarify the origin of the kink - energy sum rules we shall develop a treatment  la bogomolny @xcite rather than applying the hamilton - jacobi method as in @xcite . the system , which is a generalization of the mstb model to a three - component scalar field , is the bosonic sector of a super - symmetric system : the interaction energy is derived from a super - potential ( in fact , this property is not exclusive of the three - component case : the @xmath2-component analogue model is also the bosonic sector of a super - symmetric theory ) .",
    "thus , the time - independent solutions satisfy a set of systems of first - order ode that , of course , is equivalent to the ode system obtained in the framework of the hamilton - jacobi paradigm .",
    "the bonus of this approach is double : first , the appearance of the kink energies as several bogomolny bounds clarifies the fact that the energy of a generic kink is equal to the sum of the energies of two or three non - generic kinks in several ways and , second , the bogomolny formulation allows us to prove the stability of one of the kink solutions : the absolute minimum of the energy in the appropriate topological sector .",
    "there is a symmetry group in the system that is generated by the transformations @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , are the three components of the field .",
    "this group , @xmath7 , acts on the variety of kink solutions , which are classified into three types ; see @xcite :    \\1 . .",
    "there are two three - parametric families of topological kink trajectories whose three components are non - null . for obvious reasons ,",
    "they are usually termed as tk3 kinks .",
    "we shall use the term kink orbit , or simply kink , to denote the kink solution without specifying the spatial dependence . from this point of view , tk3 kinks are two two - parametric families of kink orbits and two three - parametric families of kink trajectories or solitary waves .",
    "there are four one - parametric families of non - topological kink orbits that also have three non - null components .",
    "ntk3 kinks live on one ellipsoid in the @xmath8 internal space that encloses all the other kinks .",
    "all the solitary waves of the @xmath9 mstb model appear embedded twice in the kink manifold of the @xmath10 system .",
    "thus , these kinks have at most two non - null components .",
    "there are two classes : a ) two - component non - topological and topological kinks .",
    "the ntk2 kink orbits form two one - parametric families in the @xmath11 plane and another two one - parametric families in the @xmath12 plane .",
    "tk2 kinks appear at a limit of these two families that we shall explain later .",
    "b ) one - component topological kinks .",
    "there exists one topological tk1 kink and one anti - kink both of which live on the @xmath13-axis .",
    "we briefly describe the action of @xmath14 on a given kink , starting in the opposite order :    * one - component topological kinks and anti - kinks are fixed points of the action of the elements @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the transformation @xmath17 , however , sends a tk1 kink to its anti - kink , and vice - versa . *",
    "the ntk2 families are invariant under the action of either @xmath16 or @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath18 exchanges the families living in the same plane . finally , @xmath15 sends one ntk2 kink of the @xmath11 plane to another in the same family , all of them invariant under @xmath16 .",
    "we find the same situation with the ntk2 family in the @xmath12 plane with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath19 , respectively . *",
    "the four ntk3 families are interchanged through the action of @xmath18 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath15 , however , relates two ntk3 kinks in the same family . *",
    "the two tk3 families are related by the @xmath18 transformation . @xmath15 and @xmath20 link two tk3 kinks in the same family .",
    "the moduli space of kinks is the quotient of the variety of kinks by the action of the @xmath14 group .",
    "restriction to the sub - variety of generic kinks leads to a good structure for the kink moduli sub - space because there are no fixed points",
    ". we shall show ( see also @xcite ) that the kink solutions are obtained using jacobi elliptic coordinates in the internal @xmath8 space .",
    "the sub - space of tk3 kink orbits in elliptic coordinates is parametrized by two real integration constants .",
    "thus , the tk3 moduli sub - space is the open @xmath21 plane .",
    "because the change from cartesian to elliptic coordinates is generically a @xmath22-to-@xmath23 map , a point in @xmath24 corresponds to eight tk3 kinks , which precisely form an orbit -in the sense of group action- of the @xmath14 group .",
    "there are identities between the energy of a generic kink and the sum of one embedded kink and one enveloping kink , or the sum of several embedded kinks , in several ways .",
    "the combinations of the embedded and the enveloping kinks are singular in the sense that they are fixed points of some sub - group of @xmath14 .",
    "fortunately , one can see that the singular configurations are a limiting case of tk3 kinks that appear in the boundary \" of the tk3 moduli sub - space .",
    "this situation calls for a compactification of @xmath25 and we shall describe how it is possible to include the whole variety of kinks in a compact moduli space .",
    "we thus find analogies with the mumford - deligne compactification of the moduli space of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath26 , @xcite .",
    "also , the kink moduli space is a similar structure to the moduli space of instantons in pure gauge theory , @xcite , or of bps monopoles in yang - mills - higgs systems , @xcite : the discrete group @xmath14 replaces the infinite dimensional diffeomorphism group in the case of surfaces , or the gauge group in the other cases .",
    "the orbit of every point in the kink moduli space is a discrete set ; the main difference with respect to the gauge theoretical analogues , however , is that in the system under consideration there are no solutions with several kinks and therefore the moduli space only encompasses the sectors of topological charges @xmath27 .",
    "there is another difference with the gauge theory solitons mentioned above : both the instantons and the bps magnetic monopoles are absolute minima of either the euclidean action or the energy , and are thus completely stable .",
    "the tk3 kinks , however , are not absolute minima of the energy ; in fact , we will show that they are unstable .",
    "study of the stability of the different types of kinks is the main concern of this paper .",
    "we shall analyze the stability problem , which is crucial in order to envisage the nature of the quantum states built around the classical kinks in three stages :    * the eight super - potentials that determine eight systems of first - order equations can not be differentiated at two focal \" lines : an ellipse in the @xmath11 plane and a hyperbola in the orthogonal @xmath12 plane .",
    "kink solutions crossing by any of these curves fail to be absolute minima of the energy in their topological sectors : these solutions are obtained by gluing the solutions of at least two different systems of first - order equations .",
    "we shall also show that there are jacobi fields along these kink orbits with zeroes in the vacuum points and the intersection points with the focal lines . according to one jacobi theorem , see @xcite , these kinks are not local minima of the energy and are therefore unstable . *",
    "the direct approach to studying kink stability requires an analysis of the spectrum of the second variation , or hessian functional .",
    "the explicit expression of the hessian functional is only available for the non - generic topological kinks . in the schrodinger operator that defines the hessian quadratic form ,",
    "the potential well depends on the kink solution ; the kink solutions , however , can not be written in terms of elementary transcendental functions except in the non - generic cases mentioned above .",
    "in fact , besides the jacobi fields , the spectral problem can only be fully solved for the tk1 kink , and , partially , for the tk2@xmath28 kink .",
    "nevertheless , the information obtained this way fits in with the kink - energy sum rules and with the fact that these non - generic kinks live at the boundary of the tk3 kink moduli space perfectly well . *",
    "finally , we shall construct the morse theory for the configuration space , choosing energy as the morse functional .",
    "knowledge of the jacobi fields allows an immediate application of the morse index theorem , as in reference @xcite , to identify the morse index - the dimension of the negative eigen - space of the hessian - of a kink trajectory with the number of crossing points through the focal ellipse and hyperbola : this count measures the degree of kink instability .",
    "moreover , we can easily proceed and read the homology of the configuration space of the system from the critical point structure of the hessian , following the pattern developed in @xcite for the mstb model .",
    "this procedure affords a direct connection between the existence and fate of topological defects and the topology of the configuration space , which , in turn , reveals many features of the quantum states built from these classical extended objects .",
    "the paper is organized in three sections .",
    "there are three sub - sections in section  2 .",
    " 2.1 introduces the model and proposes that the solitary waves satisfy a set of systems of first - order ordinary differential equations .  2.2 solves the system by passing to jacobi elliptic coordinates .",
    " 2.3 discusses the existence of the ( several ) super - potentials that allow the reduction to the first - order ode system , describes the kink solutions , and establishes the stability of the absolute minimum of the energy functional . section  3",
    "is divided into three sub - sections .",
    " 3.1 states the kink - energy sum rules . in  3.2 the singular kinks are considered as the limit of generic kinks when some of the integration constants that characterize the variety of solutions tend to infinity . in  3.3",
    "we briefly discuss the results of the two previous sub sections by showing the compact kink moduli space .",
    "the theme of section  4 is the stability of kinks . in  4.1 we give explicit expressions for the jacobi fields along the tk3 and ntk trajectories .",
    "the zeroes of these fields occur when the kink trajectories cross two focal lines , one an ellipse and the other one an hyperbola .",
    "sub - section  4.2 is devoted to solving the spectral problem for the second - order fluctuation operator around the non - generic topological kinks . in ",
    "4.3 , the topological implications of stability are unveiled through the elaboration of a morse theory of kinks .",
    "finally , some reflections on kink quantization are offered in section  5 .",
    "besides the second - order evolution equations , many soliton - like solutions satisfy first - order pd or od equations in relativistic field theories with relevance in fundamental physics and cosmology . this interesting discovery is due to a generalization by bogomolny , @xcite , of the self - duality equations of euclidean gauge theory , @xcite , to other space - time dimensions and other systems .",
    "bogomolny s idea has deep topological roots and leads to very rich spaces of ( bps ) states in quantum field theory with extended super - symmetry , see @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to show how the kinks discovered in reference @xcite in a deformed @xmath0 linear sigma model also enter this framework .",
    "we start by briefly describing the model and characterizing the solitary waves as solutions of a system of first - order ode . defining non - dimensional space - time coordinates , fields and physical parameters as in @xcite ,",
    "the dynamics of the model is determined by the action functional @xmath29 we also use all the conventions in @xcite and focus on the maximally asymmetric case , @xmath30 , in the range of the manifold parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where the kink manifold is richest .",
    "the mechanical system associated with the search for the solitary wave solutions of the model is completely integrable in the sense of liouville and all the kink solutions can be found analytically .",
    "here we shall not pursue this line of research ; it has been fully developed in @xcite .",
    "instead , we assume that there exists a super - potential for the system ; i.e. , a function @xmath33 in the internal space such that : @xmath34 if this is the case , it is possible to write the energy for static configurations ( @xmath35 )  la bogomolny , see @xcite : @xmath36&= & \\frac{m^3}{\\lambda^2\\sqrt{2}}\\int dx \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{d\\vec{\\phi}}{dx}\\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{\\phi}}{dx}+\\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\vec{\\phi } \\cdot \\vec{\\phi}-1\\right)^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{a=1}^3\\sigma_a^2 \\phi_a^2\\right\\}=\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{m^3}{2\\lambda^2\\sqrt{2}}\\left [ \\int dx \\sum_{a=1}^3\\left ( \\frac{d\\phi_a}{dx}- \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial\\phi_a}\\right ) \\left ( \\frac{d\\phi_a}{dx}- \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial\\phi_a}\\right ) + 2\\int \\sum_{a=1}^3d\\phi_a\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\phi_a}\\right ] \\label{13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] configurations that satisfy the system of first - order equations : @xmath37 do not contribute to the first term in @xmath38 $ ] and are also solutions of the second - order equations of the model .",
    "the solutions of ( [ 14 ] ) are kinks of the system if they also comply with the finite energy conditions : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a vector that belongs to the vacuum manifold @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath41 is formed by two vectors @xmath42 and the existence of two points in @xmath41 classifies the kink solutions into topological and non - topological , see @xcite for details .",
    "every kink orbit traces out a path in the internal @xmath8 space .",
    "there are two possibilities :    * the super - potential @xmath43 is differentiable along the kink path .",
    "thus , the second term in ( [ 13 ] ) is the integral of an exact differential and stoke s theorem tells us that it depends on the difference of the values of @xmath44 at the path endpoints .",
    "the energy is a topological bound and the kinks of this type are absolute minima of @xmath38 $ ] and stable against small fluctuations .",
    "* there is a discrete set of points along the kink path where @xmath43 is not differentiable . the second term in ( [ 13 ] )",
    "is only differentiable piece - wise and @xmath38 $ ] also depends on the values of @xmath43 at those points of non - differentiability ; for this type of kinks , @xmath38 $ ] is not a topological bound .",
    "we can not say strictly that these kinks are solutions of ( [ 14 ] ) because the points of non - differentiability of @xmath43 are turning points of the the kink orbit .",
    "moreover , in sub - section  2.3 we shall show that there are eight possible choices of @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 is a point where @xmath44 is non - differentiable , a kink is a solution of ( [ 14 ] ) for @xmath46 , with a given choice of @xmath44 ; the same kink solves ( [ 14 ] ) with another choice of @xmath44 for @xmath47 .",
    "these kinks are solutions of the second - order equations but are not absolute minima of @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "we shall see that not only the non - topological kinks belong to this class , but also many others that live in the topological sectors .",
    "we now introduce jacobi elliptic coordinates in the internal @xmath8 space , see @xcite",
    ". defining @xmath48 , we shall denote by @xmath49 the interior of the infinite parallelepiped @xmath50 : @xmath51    thus the map @xmath52 , from @xmath8 to @xmath49 , given by the change of coordinates : @xmath53 sends eight points of @xmath8 to one point in @xmath54 and induces a riemannian metric in @xmath54 : @xmath55 , where : @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the potential energy , @xmath58 , in elliptic coordinates reads : @xmath59    the crucial question is the following : is there a function @xmath60 such that the potential @xmath61 can be written in the form @xmath62 the answer is affirmative if the super - potential @xmath60 is a solution of the pde : @xmath63    note that ( [ 19 ] ) is no more than the hamilton - jacobi equation , formula ( 20 ) in @xcite , for the hamilton characteristic function @xmath60 , with no explicit dependence on @xmath64 .",
    "searching for solutions of the form @xmath65 , ( [ 19 ] ) becomes three separate ode : @xmath66 the ordinary differential equations into which the hj equation degenerates when all the separation constants are at zero , see formula ( 29 ) for @xmath10 in @xcite .",
    "the integration of ( [ 20 ] ) is elementary : @xmath67 if we set the integration constant to be zero .",
    "there is also a sign ambiguity fixed by the choice of @xmath68 .",
    "thus , there are eight solutions of the pde ( [ 19 ] ) : @xmath69 the generalization of equation ( [ eqq ] ) to the @xmath2-component scalar field case is solved using the same antsatz : @xmath70 leads us to the solution : @xmath71 .    the energy for static configurations is written in elliptic coordinates as : @xmath72=\\frac{m^3}{2\\lambda^2\\sqrt{2 } } \\int dx \\sum_{a , b=1}^3 \\left\\ { g_{ab}(\\vec{\\lambda } ) \\frac{d\\lambda_a}{dx}\\cdot \\frac{d\\lambda_b}{dx}+g_{ab}^{-1}(\\vec{\\lambda})\\frac{\\partial w^{(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)}}{\\partial\\lambda_a}\\frac{\\partial w^{(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)}}{\\partial \\lambda_b}\\right\\}\\label{22}\\ ] ] the possibility of writing the potential energy as a square `` in this way means that the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theory system admits a @xmath73 super - symmetric extension . here we shall not discuss the super - symmetric system ; instead , we focus on the fact that the energy can be written  la bogomolny @xcite : @xmath74&=&\\frac{m^3}{2\\lambda^2\\sqrt{2}}\\left [ \\int dx \\sum_{a , b=1 } ^3 g_{ab}(\\vec{\\lambda } ) \\left [ \\frac{d\\lambda_a}{dx } + \\sum_{c=1}^3 g_{ac}^{-1}(\\vec{\\lambda})\\frac{\\partial w^{(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3 ) } } { \\partial \\lambda_c}\\right ] \\left [ \\frac{d\\lambda_b}{dx } + \\sum_{d=1}^3 g_{bd}^{-1}(\\vec{\\lambda})\\frac{\\partial w^{(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3 ) } } { \\partial \\lambda_d}\\right ] \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{m^3}{\\lambda^2\\sqrt{2}}\\left [ \\left    w^{(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3 ) } } { \\partial\\lambda_a}[\\vec{\\lambda } ] \\frac{d\\lambda_a}{dx}\\right    a semi - definite positive contribution and there is a bound to the energy of a kink that satisfies the inequality : @xmath75\\geq \\frac{m^3}{\\lambda^2\\sqrt{2 } } \\displaystyle \\left| \\int_p \\sum_{a=1}^3\\frac{\\partial w^{(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3 ) } } { \\partial\\lambda_a}[\\vec{\\lambda } ] d\\lambda_a\\right| $ ] . the bogomolny bound is saturated -the inequality becomes equality- if the first - order '' equations @xmath76 are satisfied .",
    "we see that the existence of eight superpotentials is related to the choice of signs in the right members of the ode system ( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we could fix the superpotential , e.g. by setting @xmath77 , and allow for an independent choice of signs in each equation in ( [ 24 ] ) or in the bogomolny splitting ( [ 23 ] ) . in any case , (",
    "[ 24 ] ) constitutes eight different systems of three ordinary differential equations .",
    "we write the system ( [ 24 ] ) in the form : @xmath78 the sum of the three equations in ( [ 25 ] ) reads : @xmath79 we can also re - organize the equation ( [ 25 ] ) multiplying both members by @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "thus , this equivalent form of the ode system ( [ 25 ] ) contains six equations that can be added to obtain : @xmath82 through the use of the three equations in ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "integration of ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) provides all the separatrix orbits of the mechanical analogue system obtained by means of the hamilton - jacobi principle applied for zero particle energy and zero separation constants : compare with equations ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) for @xmath10 in reference @xcite .",
    "therefore , all the orbits found there are the kink solutions of the first - order system ( [ 24 ] ) . the kink form factors -the kink trajectories in the dynamical system terminology- are obtained after multiplication of the three equations in ( [ 25 ] ) by @xmath83 , addition of the three resulting identities , and use of ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) : @xmath84 note that the boundary conditions ( [ 15 ] ) in elliptic coordinates read : @xmath85 moreover , by squaring the first equation in ( [ 24 ] ) and defining the generalized momentum @xmath86 , we obtain : @xmath87 equation ( [ 36 ] ) describes the motion of a particle with zero energy moving under the influence of a potential @xmath88 @xmath89 has a maximum at @xmath90 and goes to @xmath91 when @xmath92 tends to @xmath91 ; therefore , bounded motion occurs only in the @xmath93 $ ] interval .",
    "together with the boundary conditions ( [ 28 ] ) , this means that the kink configurations lie in the finite parallelepiped @xmath94 : @xmath95 .      in this section",
    "we shall analyze the solutions of the first order equations ( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "the change in coordinates from cartesian to elliptic is singular at each face in @xmath94 , except at the dynamical frontier @xmath90 .",
    "we shall thus deal carefully with the limiting behaviour of the system in @xmath96 .",
    "there is a dimensional reduction of the system at these points and we expect a different kind of behaviour with respect to the regular points of the interior of @xmath97 .",
    "computation of the energies of the kink solutions can be performed by noticing that the solutions of the first - order equations ( [ 24 ] ) saturate the bogomolny bound : @xmath98=\\left|\\int_k dw^{(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)}\\right| $ ]      integration of ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) provides the orbits that the generic kinks trace in the internal space @xmath8 : @xmath99 @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are real integration constants .",
    "the kink form factor is obtained from integration of the equation ( [ 29 ] ) , @xmath103 and depends on a third integration constant @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the solitary kink waves of our system are composed of two ingredients : the orbit and the form factor .    the explicit integrations in ( [ 57 ] ) and",
    "( [ 58 ] ) are performed in reference @xcite , where they are written in compact form in formulas ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) .",
    "all the @xmath105 kink orbits found there are described in sub - section  3.2 of @xcite by means of a numerical algorithm implemented in mathematica ( here we reproduce figure 1 of a generic tk3 in both cartesian and elliptic space ) .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for information about the @xmath105 curves .",
    "instead , we now focus on computing the energy of a @xmath105 generic kink as a bogomolny bound : generic @xmath105 orbits grow from several steps , according to the different choices of signs in equations ( [ 26])-([27 ] ) .",
    "each piece of any @xmath105 orbit is a solution of the equations ( [ 26])-([27 ] ) , such that on these curves the @xmath105 kink also complies with ( [ 29 ] ) .",
    "the signs in each stage , i.e. , the values of @xmath68 in the equations ( [ 26])-([27])-([29 ] ) , must be chosen according to the sense of change in the elliptic variables along the corresponding piece of orbit .",
    "the behaviour of a generic tk3 solution in @xmath106 is as follows :    * \\1 .",
    "starting from the point d , with coordinates in @xmath107 : d@xmath108 at @xmath109 , the first step travels in @xmath110 to a point that we shall denote as p@xmath111 , the intersection of the kink with the face @xmath112 in @xmath113 , attained for some @xmath114 ( note that the invariance under translations in @xmath64 , i.e. , the arbitrariness of fixing @xmath104 , makes the exact value of @xmath115 arbitrary too ) .",

    "iteration of these basic elements produces the morse series : @xmath379    because all the coefficients of the odd powers of @xmath336 in @xmath380 are zero , the lacunary principle states that the morse inequality becomes equality , @xcite : @xmath381    the configuration space is of the same homology type as @xmath382 : the loop space in @xmath383 .",
    "there is some kind of topological universality and the first terms in @xmath384 tell us that the existence of tk2@xmath361 ak2@xmath28 kinks is due to the fact that the homology group @xmath385 is non - trivial ; the tk1 @xmath364 ak1 kink comes from @xmath386 ; the tk3 @xmath364 ak3 family corresponds to @xmath387 , and so forth .",
    "we have shown in sub - sections  4.1 and  4.2 that in the topological sectors @xmath388 and @xmath389 only the tk2@xmath246 and ak2@xmath246 kinks are stable , whereas in the non - topological sectors @xmath390 and @xmath391 only the ground states @xmath392 and @xmath393 are stable .",
    "the degree of instability of each kind of kink is measured by the morse index , which agrees with the number of kink configurations with lower energy in the same topological sector .",
