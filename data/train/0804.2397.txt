    "cuprate superconductors undergo considerable change in their electronic structure as a function of doping . in the overdoped regime",

    "superconductivity sets in at the temperature where phase coherence among the preexisting pairs occurs . only then does the system acquire long range order .",
    "another prominent possibility for the pseudogap is competing order@xcite such as d - density wave formation . on the other hand , from a phenomenological point of view many experimental findings , in the pseudogap region of the cuprate phase diagram , can be understood in a model which corresponds to a reduction of the electronic density of state in the vicinity of the fermi energy over an energy region ( @xmath0 ) which sets the pseudogap scale .",
    "an important concept in such a characterization of the pseudogap is its variation with temperature . at zero temperature",
    "there is a full gap of order @xmath0 which fills in with increasing temperature but does not change its magnitude@xcite .",

    "the rest of the fermi surface , called the fermi arc , remains ungaped .",
    "experiments have shown that the length of the fermi arc centered in the nodal direction is proportional to the reduced temperature @xmath4 and vanishes at @xmath5 at which point the entire fermi surface is fully gaped .",

    "because we have also included a background in @xmath28 in addition to a prominent peak at @xmath59 250 @xmath41 , there are minor differences , including very small tails below the energy of the prominent peak in @xmath28 shown in the inset .",
    "the dot - dashed ( blue ) curve includes a pseudogap @xmath50 550 @xmath41 with the lost states in @xmath46 moved to infinity . in this case",

    "the three remaining curves also have a pseudogap of 550 @xmath41 but , in addition the lost state in @xmath46 are placed in the energy region just above @xmath0 and state conservation is respected .",
    "this causes the scattering rate @xmath38 to rise much faster than in the dot - dashed curve because just above the gap we have more states to scatter into .",
    "the steepness of the rise depends on the distribution of states above @xmath63 .",
    "the more the pileup is restricted in range the steeper the rise .",
    "medium ( purple ) , light ( olive ) , and heavy ( red ) solid curves correspond , respectively to the case when the missing states are placed between @xmath0 and @xmath64 , 1.5@xmath0 , and 1.1@xmath0 ( see inset in the top frame for the case 1.5 @xmath0 where the dos is shown ) .",

    "these rules are very nearly satisfied in our model calculation even though we are using the spectra displayed in the inset lower frame rather than a pure delta function .",
    "we recall that the k - k transform of a sharp step like rise at @xmath54 and constant after this as applies to the quasiparticle scattering rate in a delta function model , has a logarithmic singularity at @xmath55 .",
