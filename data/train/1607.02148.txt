    "following these developments , several recent works @xcite have shown that under reasonable assumptions dns mergers can account for the history of r - process enrichment in the galaxy .",
    "however , recently , @xcite have used the observations of @xmath0-process elements in dwarf satellite galaxies to question the dns merger scenario for @xmath0-process production .",
    "@xcite , and independently , @xcite reported the discovery of an @xmath0-process enriched ultra - faint dwarf  ( ufd ) galaxy reticulum ii , the total stellar luminosity of reticulum ii is @xmath5 and the line of sight velocity dispersion is @xmath6  km / s  @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the kick given to the dns during the second collapse would eject the binary from such a small galaxy .",
    "a second problem that arises is that ufds are composed of very old stellar population  @xcite , suggesting that the chemical abundances have been frozen since @xmath7  gyr ago .",
    "this requires that the @xmath0-process formation should take place relatively soon after the formation of the first stars .",
    "this raises the question whether mergers could take place sufficiently rapidly so that their @xmath0-process material would be able to enrich the old stellar population .",
    "@xcite suggested , therefore , that a different mechanism must have produced the observed @xmath0-process material in these galaxies .",
    "a significant population of  rapid mergers \" ( @xmath8gyr ) is natural , and in fact is expected from observations of dns systems in our galaxy .",
    "two of the ten observed dns systems in our galaxy ( that do nt reside in globular clusters and for which the masses are well constrained ) , the double pulsar , j0737 - 3039 , and the original binary pulsar , b1913 - 16 , will merge in less than a few hundred myr .",

    "while the smallness of the sample and unknown selection effects do nt allow an accurate estimate of these distributions a clear picture emerges , there are two distinct types of neutron star formation .",
    "the majority of the systems , about two thirds , involve a minimal mass ejection ( @xmath13 ) and low kick velocities ( @xmath14  kms@xmath15 ) .",
    "the double pulsar system , psr j0737 - 3039 , is a prime candidate of this kind of collapse with @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "subsequent addition of a low mass ejection channel of neutron star formation ( via electron capture sne ) to population synthesis models @xcite improved the fit of the models to the observed dns population .",

    "@xcite have argued that many dnss are expected to remain confined and merge within globular clusters , which have comparable escape velocities to ufds .    to explore these ideas we begin , in  [ sec : kicks ] with a simulation of the typical velocities of dns systems using the implied distributions of mass ejection and kicks from bp16 .",
    "we then address the delay times between formation and merger in  [ rapid ] .",
    "we show that a significant fraction of dns systems will remain confined in ufds and merge rapidly , demonstrating the viability of dns mergers as sources of @xmath0-process material in ufds . in  [ sec : impgalaxy ] we consider the implications of these findings to the related problem of observation of heavy @xmath0-process material in some very low metallicity stars in the galaxy .",
    "we summarize our results and the case for dns mergers as the source of heavy @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis in ",

    "consider the second collapse leading to the formation of the younger neutron star in a neutron star binary . assuming an initially circular orbit , the change in the centre of mass velocity , @xmath18 , due to the second collapse is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the masses of the pulsar and the ( collapsing ) companion today , @xmath22 is the companion mass right before the collapse",
    ", @xmath23 is the initial keplerian velocity and @xmath24 is the kick velocity imparted on the companion by the ejected mass . naturally , if both the ejected mass , @xmath25 and the kick , @xmath26 are sufficiently small , the change in the cm velocity is also small .",
    "an inevitable mass loss , of order @xmath27 @xcite , arises due to emission of neutrinos . plugging these values into eq .",
    "[ eq : vcm ] with an initial separation @xmath28 cm , final neutron star masses of @xmath29 and no asymmetric kick , we find : @xmath30 .",
    "this is an approximate minimal value for the change in the cm velocity due to the collapse .",
    "a kick with a similar magnitude in approximately the opposite direction ( or increasing @xmath31 , although see  [ sec : introduction ] ) reduces somewhat this value .",
    "bp16 considered the orbital parameters and masses of the galactic dns population and constrained the two distributions of mass ejection and kick velocities directly from observations ( with no a - priori assumptions regarding evolutionary models and/or types of collapse involved ) .",
    "they ve shown that there is strong evidence for two distinct types of stellar collapses : the majority of systems have small eccentricities ( we refer to these as  small @xmath32 systems \" ) implying a small mass ejection ( @xmath33 ) and a low kick velocity ( @xmath34kms@xmath15 ) . only a minority of the systems (  large @xmath32 systems",
    "\" ) have been formed via the standard sn scenario involving a larger mass ejection of @xmath35 and kick velocities of up to @xmath36kms@xmath15 .    to calculate the fraction of systems with a given @xmath18 we performed a monte carlo simulation using the best fit distributions of collapse parameters found in bp16 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , given the rather small number of observed dns systems in the galaxy and possible observational biases ( see bp16 ) , it is impossible to determine the exact shapes of these distributions .",
    "the following calculations should thus be treated as an order of magnitude estimates .",
    "note , however , that bp16 considered several functional shapes for these distributions and the results depend only weakly on the exact functional shape chosen .",
    "we assume that @xmath37 of the systems are  small @xmath32 systems \" with a log - normal mass ejection distribution ( above the minimum neutrino mass loss , which we take here to be @xmath38 ) peaking at @xmath39 and a log - normal kick distribution peaking at @xmath40kms@xmath15 while @xmath41 of the systems are  large @xmath32 systems \" with a log - normal mass ejection distribution peaking at @xmath42 and a log - normal kick distribution peaking at @xmath43kms@xmath15 . in all of these distributions",
    "the standard deviations are half the magnitude of the corresponding peaks .",
    "the direction of the kick velocities were chosen randomly .",
    "in addition we take @xmath44 , and initially circular orbits with constant separations .",
    "[ fig : vcmdist ] depicts the fraction of dns systems with @xmath45 as a function of @xmath46 for different initial separations .",
    "the initial keplerian velocity decreases as the initial separation increases , resulting in a larger fraction of systems with small cm velocities for larger separations .",
    "the shape of each curve is composed of two sharp rises , the first corresponding to the  small @xmath32 systems \" with weak kicks and the second to the  large @xmath32 systems \" with strong kicks . for initial separations in the range @xmath47 cm ,",
    "a significant fraction of dns systems ( between @xmath48 ) have a cm velocity @xmath49kms@xmath15 ( smaller than a typical escape velocity of ufds ) .",
    "this suggests that if these systems originated in such galaxies , they would , most likely , remain bound .",
    "the time until merger of a dns depends strongly on the initial separation and eccentricity .",
    "generally an explosion occurring in one of the members of a binary , will cause the binary to become less bound .",
    "even if no asymmetric kick is imparted due to the explosion , the ejection of mass causes the stars to be less gravitationally bound .",
    "this can also be seen from the equation for energy conservation with no kick : @xmath50^{-1}=\\left[1-\\frac{\\delta m}{m_c+m_p}\\right]^{-1}>1\\ .\\ ] ] nevertheless , if the kick is oriented such that the relative velocity of the stars decreases , the system can become more bound after the explosion . since for a circular orbit , the kinetic energy is exactly minus that of the total orbital energy , the most energy that can be extracted is by reducing the kinetic to zero , thus doubling the ( negative ) energy and leaving the binary with half of the initial semi - major axis and a very eccentric ( @xmath51 ) orbit . for this to occur , the kick has to be oriented appropriately and its magnitude should be comparable to the keplerian velocity . a dns system with a kick of this type would merge on a much shorter time - scale than implied by the original separation .",
    "we carried out a monte carlo simulation as described in ",
    "[ sec : kicks ] . for each realization",
    ", we calculate the conditions after the second collapse and use the separation and eccentricity to find the time until merger due to gw emission . the fraction of dns systems merging by a time @xmath52 for both the  small @xmath32 \" and ",
    "large @xmath32 \" groups is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : probtmerger ] . for @xmath53 cm ( @xmath54 cm ) ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this population has important effects on the typical delay between sne and dns mergers leading to a faster rise in the abundance of heavy r - process elements as a compared to the iron abundance @xcite .",
    "so far we have addressed the questions of merger time and cm velocities separately .",
    "however , systems with confining kicks are preferentially those that undergo larger changes in the cm velocity .",
    "the decrease in the gravitational orbital energy is compensated by an increase in the kinetic energy of the cm .",
    "thus , although important for larger galaxies , confining kicks are not relevant for ufds .",
    "for the latter , it is important to consider the combined probability of having a rapid merger with a small cm velocity .",
    "[ fig : probtandv ] describes the fraction of dns systems merging before 1gyr with @xmath61 as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "we consider an initially circular orbit with a separation @xmath53 cm ( @xmath54 cm ) . for @xmath53",
    "cm , @xmath62 of the systems merge by 1gyr and have @xmath63kms@xmath15 ( comparable to the lowest escape velocities of ufds ) .",
    "however , this fraction decreases significantly , down to @xmath64 , for @xmath54 cm .",
    "as expected the distribution is dominated by the  small @xmath32 \" group of systems which merge on a time - scale that is dictated by their initial separation .",
    "the existence of rapid mergers as well as evidence for the typical initial separations used here is supported by observations of known dns systems in our galaxy ( see  [ sec : impgalaxy ] for details ) .",
    "another line of evidence for the existence of rapid mergers arises from observations of sgrb hosts .",
    "since sgrbs are most likely associated with dns mergers @xcite , one may expect that in the absence of rapid mergers , sgrbs would be predominantly observed in the more massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "in fact , a significant fraction of sgrbs are observed in star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of sgrbs in star forming galaxies is naturally expected if a significant population of dns systems merge rapidly .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to explore the possibility of a dns mergers taking place in ufds . still , this work and in particular the parts corresponding to rapid mergers has also implications to nucleosynthesis in the milky way .",
    "abundances of @xmath0-process elements have been observed in halo and disk stars covering a metallicity range @xmath65}\\approx-3.1 - 0.5 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this requires a significant fraction of @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis to take place within a few hundred myr or less .",
    "this has been used as an argument against dns mergers as the origin of heavy @xmath0-process material in the galaxy .",
    "the argument is roughly the following : dns mergers will take place a few gyr after star formation at which stage all stars would already be  contaminated \" by a significant amount of iron .",
    "furthermore , dns mergers require sne and those will produce iron before the @xmath0-process material is produced .",
    "most galactic dns systems were born in the past when the galactic sfr was larger ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . however",
    ", all the  rapid mergers \" that formed at that time have already merged .",
    "hence the total fraction of rapid mergers is larger than what is currently observed in the galactic binary pulsar population .",
    "this result is consistent with the global fast decay in the rate of sgrbs in the universe @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the observation that the current rate of deposition of radioactive @xmath66pu on earth is much lower than what it was 4.6  gyr ago when the solar system was formed @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that dns mergers can take place rapidly enough and enrich at least some parts of our galaxy on very short time scales .",
    "specifically , @xmath57 of the large @xmath32 systems with @xmath53 cm have merger times less than @xmath59  myr .",
    "they play important roles to account for a fast rise in the abundances of heavy @xmath0-process elements of metal poor stars in the galaxy .",
    "the large fluctuations in the eu / fe ratio in metal poor stars , supports a rare enrichment process like dns merger  .",
    "regarding the problem of  contamination \" of the ism by iron from sne that took place prior to the formation of the dns system , we note that in a significant fraction of the cases , the dns systems are produced with very little mass ejection .",
    "in other cases , the proper motion of the dns relative to their birth rest frame suggests that even in a few hundred myr they could move sufficiently within the galaxy to avoid the ism that has been contaminated by their  progenitor \" sne .",
    "such an effect should be taken into account in chemical evolution studies .",
    "an open question related to this involves the not yet understood topic of possible large scale turbulent mixing in the galaxy .",
    "we have examined here dns mergers as sources of heavy @xmath0-process material in dwarf galaxies .",
    "we have shown that both arguments raised by @xcite , that dns systems may be ejected from their galaxies due to strong kicks received at formation , and that dns would not be able to merge rapidly enough before the star formation in these galaxies has stopped , are naturally overcome .",
    "first , due to a significant population of dns receiving weak kicks at birth ( bp16 ) , a large fraction of dns systems would have cm velocities @xmath49kms@xmath15 ( comparable to the lowest escape velocities from ufds ) .",
    "second , given limits on the separation of the double pulsar system before its second collapse , a significant fraction of systems are expected to both remain confined in ufd galaxies and merge within less than a gyr .    moving from ufds to the galaxy , where small velocities are not required to remain confined ,",
    "the fraction of rapid mergers becomes even larger due to the contribution of  confining kicks \" .",
    "limits on the time between the second collapse until eventual merger , of two out of the ten observed dns systems in the galaxy , imply that many dns systems are expected to merge within less than a few hundred myr .",
    "this is also supported by observations of a rapid decay in the sgrb rate following the peak of star formation in the universe .",
    "this population of rapid mergers is composed mainly of systems that were formed with small amounts of mass ejection @xmath67 , ( bp16 ) .",
    "moreover , the mergers take place far away from the place of the progenitor sne .",
    "this implies that dns mergers can naturally account for the observations of significant amounts of @xmath0-process material in some low metallicities halo stars in the galaxy .",
    "this invalidates the argument used against dns mergers as the origin of @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis in our galaxy .",
