    "many physical phenomena that exhibit discontinuous solutions can be described by hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "various numerical methods have been proposed to approximate the solutions of these hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "upwind and central schemes @xcite are two of them which are widely used .",
    "an advantage of upwind schemes over central schemes is reduced numerical dissipation when dealing with discontinuous solutions .",
    "upwind schemes , however , involve the solution of local riemann problems @xcite which renders such algorithms numerically more complex and more costly . on the other hand ,",
    "central schemes are technically simpler as they do not require riemann solvers at the price of larger numerical diffusion . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on higher order central schemes in an effort to combine reduced numerical dissipation and computational cost .",
    "the very first central scheme was proposed by lax and friedrichs @xcite .",
    "this scheme employs spatial averaging of neighboring grid cells as part of the integration step  a procedure that can be regarded as an imprecise and highly diffusive partial approximation of a riemann problem .",
    "being first order accurate , the lax - friedrichs scheme is numerically too dissipative to be of practical use . with the aim of reducing the numerical viscosity ,",
    "a second order central scheme based on a non - oscillatory reconstruction of the linear interpolant has been developed @xcite .",
    "this approach was further improved by kurganov et al.@xcite by introducing second and third order semi - discrete central schemes .",
    "the heart of these semi - discrete central schemes is centrally weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( cweno ) reconstruction of the local polynomial under consideration .",
    "various third and fourth order cweno reconstruction methods have been proposed for 1d , 2d and 3d hyperbolic conservation laws @xcite .",
    "the genuine two - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite cweno reconstructions need bi - quadratic and triple - quadratic polynomials respectively .",
    "hence a truly multidimensional reconstruction requires all cells in a multi - dimensional stencil simultaneously to build up a reconstruction polynomial .",
    "in contrast , a dimension - by - dimension reconstruction just requires a few one - dimensional reconstruction sweeps . therefore a genuine multi - dimensional reconstruction is , particularly in three dimensions , computationally much more expensive than a dimension - by - dimension reconstruction .",
    "kurganov et al.@xcite have developed a third order semi - discrete central scheme for 2d hyperbolic systems using a third order dimension - by - dimension cweno reconstruction .",
    "the fourth order cweno reconstruction @xcite has not been investigated using the dimension - by - dimension approach for multidimensional problems and hence no comparison with truly multidimensional cweno reconstruction could be made . moreover , the efficiencies of a third and fourth order cweno reconstructions for multidimensional problems have not been compared yet . hence , the goal of this paper is to reconsider these aspects with the aim to provide an efficient fourth order central scheme using a dimension - by - dimension approach .",
    "the flow of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we give a brief overview of multidimensional hyperbolic conservation laws and the semi - discrete scheme .",
    "section iii has been devoted to the fourth order cweno reconstruction and the dimension - by - dimension reconstruction methods for multi - dimensional hyperbolic problems .",
    "section vi demonstrates the fourth order accuracy of the present scheme by solving various multi - dimensional linear and nonlinear hyperbolic problems and provides a comparison with truly multidimensional central schemes . in section v non - oscillatory behavior is confirmed and compared with truly multidimensional central schemes for the oblique sod s shock tube problem , 2d blast wave problem , 2d riemann problem , 3d burger s equation and 3d blast wave problem . in section",
    "vi , we compare the efficiencies of three dimensional central scheme @xcite with present fourth order central scheme for smooth and non - smooth nonlinear problems . in section vii",
    ", we provide a brief summary of the work presented in this paper .",
    "the 2d hyperbolic conservation laws in general from can be expressed as follows :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 . kurganov et al .",
    "@xcite first derived the semi - discrete scheme for one - dimensional conservation laws and later extended it for the multidimensional problems as ,    @xmath4    here @xmath5 is the cell average which is defined as ,    @xmath6    the function @xmath7 is the higher order centrally weighted essentially non - oscillatory polynomial .",
    "the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the higher order edge averaged fluxes along @xmath10- , @xmath11-directions respectively which can be computed by integrating the higher order point value fluxes over the grid cell edge .",
    "the point value flux at ( @xmath12 ) along the @xmath10-direction is defined as ,    @xmath13    the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote right and left reconstructed point values and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the corresponding point value fluxes of the conserved quantities at ( @xmath12 ) . here",
    "@xmath18 is the local maximum speeds of propagation which is estimated as    @xmath19    where @xmath20(a ) is the maximum of the magnitude of the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix a.    the authors of ref.@xcite have derived the semi - discrete scheme independent of the reconstruction polynomial .",
    "this allows us to use the 1d fourth order cweno reconstruction polynomial @xcite dimension - by - dimension along with a standard fourth order runge - kutta method @xcite as time integrator to develop a fourth order central scheme for multidimensional problems . in the next section",
    "we will give a brief overview of 1d fourth order cweno reconstruction and will talk about different ways to implement a dimension - by - dimension approach .",
    "the fourth order cweno reconstruction for 1d hyperbolic problems is comprehensively described by levy et al .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we give a brief overview of the method .",
    "in each cell @xmath21 , one has to reconstruct a quadratic polynomial @xmath22 which is a convex combination of three quadratic polynomials @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that ,    @xmath26    @xmath22 is reconstructed so as to satisfy all the three constraints accuracy , conservation and non - oscillatory .",
    "the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath27 are obtained uniquely by requiring it to conserve the cell averages @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "thus , each polynomial , @xmath27 , can be written as ,    @xmath32    the nonlinear weights @xmath33 are obtained as before , _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath34    here @xmath35 , @xmath36 are chosen to be @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively and @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "@xmath41 are the smoothness indicators which are defined as ,    @xmath42    once we have reconstructed all the the polynomials ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , smoothness indicators can easily be computed using eq .",
    "and hence nonlinear weights using eq .. these weights are finally used to reconstruct non - oscillatory the polynomial @xmath22 which provides fourth order accurate point values at the cell interfaces in smooth regions .    in the next subsection",
    ", we discuss the dimension - by - dimension approach for the multidimensional problems .      reconstructing a discretized solution on a cartesian grid in @xmath46-dimensional space with the",
    "dimension - by - dimension approach generally requires @xmath46 1d - reconstructions , one in each orthogonal direction . at the point of interception of these @xmath46 reconstructions a point value with the accuracy of the reconstruction polynomial",
    "is obtained .",
    "based on the higher - order point value usually computed on the cell edge in this way , a point - value numerical flux can be defined . in the following",
    ", we will discuss three different ways to arrive at the edge averaged numerical flux which will eventually be required in eq.(2 ) .",
    "first approach  in many publications ( see for example @xcite ) the average numerical flux is obtained by applying simpson s @xmath47 integration over the grid cell edges in the context of truly multi - dimensional reconstruction . in the dimension - by - dimension approach this procedure of averaging",
    "requires sixteen sweeps of 1d cweno reconstruction in each cell for 2d problems as can be seen in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "if one extends this method of integration to 3d problems it would require seventy eight sweeps of 1d cweno reconstruction in each grid cell .",
    "we have confirmed the fourth order accuracy and the shock capturing nature of this procedure in various nonlinear multidimensional problems .",
    "however , this method turns out to be computationally too expensive specially for 3d problems .",
    "second approach  one way of reducing the number of computationally expensive reconstruction steps is to compute the point value fluxes at the edge centers ( e , w , n , s ) which needs only eight sweeps of 1d cweno reconstruction for 2d problems .",
    "one can then perform a fourth order accurate averaging procedure @xcite to compute fourth order accurate averaged numerical flux as follows ,    @xmath48    if we extend this method to 3d problems it would require eighteen sweeps of 1d cweno reconstructions in each grid cell .",
    "we have confirmed the fourth order accuracy and the shock capturing nature of this procedure also in various nonlinear multidimensional problems .",
    "third approach ",
    "one can further reduce the computational cost by applying the finite difference formula @xcite to compute the point values ( e , w , n , s ) of the conserved quantities as ,    @xmath49    here @xmath50 stands for the edge average along the @xmath11-direction .",
    "this procedure requires only four sweeps of 1d cweno reconstruction in each grid cell for 2d problems .",
    "an extension of this to the 3d problems would involve only six sweeps of 1d cweno reconstruction .",
    "we have compared the accuracy , non - oscillatory behavior and computational expense of all the three approaches for various multi - dimensional nonlinear problems and found no significant difference among the three except the computational cost .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we compare the performance of the three approaches for 3d linear advection test and find that the third approach is approximately @xmath51 times faster than the first approach and @xmath52 times faster than the second approach for 3d hyperbolic problems .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab9 ]    thus , we see that the implementation of the present fourth order central scheme involves an additional non - negligible but generally acceptable computational expense together with significantly reduced numerical dissipation when compared with the third order implementation @xcite .",
    "a genuine multi - dimensional reconstruction for higher order schemes is complex and computationally more expensive than a dimension - by - dimension approach .",
    "therefore , in this paper we have adopted a dimension - by - dimension cweno approach to obtain a fourth order accurate central scheme .",
    "different ways to employ a dimension - by - dimension cweno approach have been discussed and the most efficient method has been applied to develop a fourth order cweno scheme to solve multidimensional hyperbolic problems . the fourth order accuracy and the non - oscillatory property",
    "are confirmed in various multi - dimensional problems .",
    "the accuracy of the present dimension - by - dimension cweno approach is found to be identical with truly multi - dimensional cweno schemes .",
