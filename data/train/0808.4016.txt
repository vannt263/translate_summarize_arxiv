    "single molecule biochemical experiments provide highly detailed knowledge about the mean time between successive reaction events and hence about the reaction rates .",
    "additionally , they deliver qualitatively new information , inaccessible to bulk experiments , by measuring other reactions statistics , such as variances and autocorrelations of successive reaction times @xcite . in their turn",
    ", these quantities relate to structural properties of the reaction networks , uncovering such phenomena as internal enzyme states or multi - step nature of seemingly simple reactions , and hence starting a new chapter in the studies of the complex biochemistry that underlies cellular regulation , signaling , and metabolism .    however , the bridge between the experimental data and the network properties is not trivial .",
    "since the class of exactly solvable biologically relevant models is limited @xcite , exact analytical calculations of statistical properties of reactions are impossible even for some of the simplest networks . similarly , the variational approach @xcite and other analytical approximations are of little help when the experimentally observed quantities depend on features that are difficult to approximate , such as the tails of the reaction events distributions .",
    "therefore , computer simulations are often the method of choice to explore an agreement between a presumed model and the observed experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , even the simplest biochemical simulations often face serious problems , both conceptual and practical .",
    "first , the networks usually involve _ combinatorially many _ molecular species and elementary reaction processes : for example , a single molecular receptor with @xmath0 modification sites can exist in @xmath1 states , and an even larger number of reactions connecting them @xcite .",
    "second , while it is widely known that _",
    "some _ molecules occur in the cell at very low copy numbers ( e.g. , a single copy of the dna ) , which give rise to relatively large stochastic fluctuations@xcite , it is less appreciated that the combinatorial complexity makes this true for _ almost all _ molecular species .",
    "indeed , complex systems with a large number of molecules , like in eukaryotic cells , may have small abundances of typical microscopic species if the number of the species is combinatorially large .",
    "third , and perhaps the most profound difficulty of the `` understanding - through - simulations '' approach , is that only very few of the kinetic parameters underlying the combinatorially complex , stochastic biochemical networks are experimentally observed or even observable .",
    "for example , the average rate of phosphorylation of a receptor on a particular residue can be measured , but it is hopeless to try to determine the rate for each of the individual microscopic states of the molecule determined by its modification on each of the other available sites .    while some day computers may be able to tackle the formidable problem of modeling astronomically large biochemical networks as a series of random discrete molecular reaction events ( which will properly account for stochastic copy number fluctuations ) , and then performing sweeps through parameter spaces in search of an agreement with experiments , such powerful computers are still far away .",
    "more importantly , even if this computational ability were available , it would not help in building a comprehensible , tractable interpretation of the modeled biological processes and in identifying connections between microscopic features and macroscopic parameters of the networks .",
    "clearly , such an interpretation can be aided by simplifying the networks through coarse - graining , that is , by merging or eliminating certain nodes and/or reaction processes . ideally , as in fig .",
    "[ cascade ] , one wants to substitute a whole network of elementary ( that is , single - step , poisson - distributed ) biochemical reactions with a few complex reaction links connecting the species that survive the coarse - graining in a way that retains predictability of the system . not incidentally ,",
    "this would also help with each of the three major roadblocks mentioned above , by reducing the number of interacting elements , increasing the number of molecules in agglomerated hyperspecies , and combining multiple features into a much smaller number of effective , mesoscopic kinetic parameters .",
    "( a ) a complex network of elementary reactions connecting the _ input _ and the _ output _ nodes .",
    "note that the choice of these nodes usually distinguishes different coarse - graining schemes , and it is rather arbitrary . in our work ,",
    "the choice is determined by the adiabatic time scale separation , as described in _",
    "methods_. in principle , such networks can be coarse - grained by multiple methods . in ( b ) we illustrate the decimation procedure , where intermediate nodes with fast dynamics get eliminated successively , resulting in complex reactions connecting their immediate neighbors ; the statistics of these complex reactions are determined by the cumulant generating functions ( cgf ) @xmath2 , cf .  _",
    "results_. other coarse - graining schemes are possible .",
    "for example , ( c ) nodes can be merged in hyper - nodes , again connected to each other by complex reactions .",
    "combinations of the strategies are also allowed .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) resemble the decimation and the blocking procedures in statistical physics @xcite , and , not coincidentally , statistical physics is the field where coarse - graining has had the biggest impact and is the most developed @xcite . both the decimation and the blocking are in the spirit of the real - space renormalization group on an irregular lattice , and one can also think of momentum - space - like approaches as a complement @xcite .",
    ", width=14 ]    the importance of coarse - graining in biochemistry has been understood since 1913 @xcite , when the first deterministic coarse - graining mechanism , now known as the michaelis - menten ( mm ) enzyme , was proposed for the following kinetic scheme : @xmath3}]{k_{1}[e][s ] } c\\xrightarrow{k_2[c ] } e+p .",

    "the enzyme catalyzes the @xmath12 transformation by merging with @xmath7 to create an unstable complex @xmath10 , which then dissociates either back into @xmath13 or forward into @xmath14 , leaving @xmath9 unmodified . if @xmath15\\gg[e]$ ] , then the enzyme cycles many times before @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] change appreciably",
    "this allows to simplify the enzyme - mediated dynamics by assuming that the enzymes equilibrate quickly at the current substrate concentration , resulting in a coarse - grained , complex reaction with decimated enzyme species : @xmath17[e]}{[s]+(k_2+k_{-1})/k_1}. \\label{mm - rate}\\ ] ]    however , this simple reduction is insufficient when stochastic effects are important : each complex mm reaction consists of multiple elementary steps , thus the statistics of the number of mm reactions per unit time , in general , is non - poissonian .",
    "while some relatively successful attempts have been undertaken to extend simple deterministic coarse - graining to the stochastic domain @xcite , a general set of tools for coarse - graining large biochemical networks has not been found yet .    in this article , we propose a method for a systematic rigorous coarse - graining of stochastic biochemical networks , which can be viewed as a step towards creation of comprehensive coarse - grained analysis tools .",
    "we start by noting that , in addition to the conceptual problems mentioned above , a technical difficulty stands in the way of stochastic simulations methods in systems biology : molecular species and reactions have very different dynamical time scales , which makes biochemical networks stiff and difficult to simulate . here",
    "we propose to use this property of separation of time scales to our advantage .",
    "the idea is not new , and multiple related approaches have been proposed in the literature , differing from each other mainly in the definition of fast and slow variables .",
    "a common practice is to use _ reaction rates _ to identify fast and slow reactions @xcite .",
    "however , if two species of very different typical abundances are coupled by one reaction , then a relatively small change in the concentration of the high abundance species can have a dramatic effect on that of the low abundance one .",
    "this notion of _ species_-based rather than _",
    "reaction_-based adiabaticity has been used in the original mm derivation , and it is also at the heart of our arguments .",
    "our method builds upon the stochastic path integral technique from mesoscopic physics @xcite , providing three major improvements that make the approach more applicable to biological networks .",
    "first , we extend the method , initially developed for large copy number species , to deal with simple discrete degrees of freedom , such as a single mm enzyme or a single gene .",
    "second , we explain how to apply the technique to a network of multiple reactions , thereby reducing the entire network to a single complex reaction step .",
    "finally , we show how the procedure can be turned into an efficient algorithm for simulations of coarse - grained networks , while preserving important statistical characteristics of the original dynamics .",
    "the algorithm is akin to the langevin @xcite or @xmath18-leaping @xcite schemes , widely used in biochemical simulations , but it allows to simulate an entire complex reaction in a single step .",
    "we believe that this development of a fast , yet precise simulation algorithm is the most important practical contribution of this manuscript .    for pedagogical reasons ,",
    "we develop the method using a model system that is simple enough for a detailed analysis , yet is complex enough to support our goals . a generalization to more complex systems",
    "is suggested in the _ discussion_.      consider the system in fig",

    "enzyme - substrate interactions are only possible in the adsorbed state .",

    "let s suppose that the latter reaction is observable ; for example , a gfp - tagged enzyme sparks each time a product molecule is created @xcite .",

    "consider an mm enzyme in the bulk together with the substrate .",
    "when the substrate concentration is small , only few of its molecules are sufficiently close to the enzyme to interact with it . in this context",
    ", one can approximate the full reaction - diffusion setup by a system having an inner ( reactive ) and an outer ( non - reactive ) regions surrounding the enzyme .",
    "diffusion takes substrate molecules between the regions with ( almost ) poisson statistics of transitions , with the rate parameters depending on the volume of the regions and the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the particles in the inner region can interact with the mm enzyme , completing the mapping between the reaction - diffusion system and the multi - state well - mixed kinetic process described above .",
    "there are three distinct effective time scales in the system in fig .  [ system ] .",
    "one is the time scale @xmath33 of the variation of the bulk substrate abundance .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 is much larger than @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , this time scale is the slowest , and we will be interested in studying the response of the system to the bulk substrate abundance @xmath19 on this scale .",
    "a faster time scale is given by the dynamics of the molecules on the membrane , @xmath34 .",
    "finally , at the other extreme , the fastest time scale , @xmath35 , is set by single reaction events , that is , the characteristic time between two successive product releases by the enzyme .",
    "overall , @xmath36 .",
    "we emphasize again that all species in the problem are connected by reactions that happen with approximately the same rates , and the separation of the time scales is a direct result of the particle abundances , rather than the conversion speeds : it takes only a few reaction events to change a low - abundance species drastically , and a lot longer to do the same to a high - abundance one .",
    "this is the main reason why we believe that this illustrative model will shed light on coarse - graining of a wide class of networks .",
    "the hierarchy of times allows us to coarse - grain the system in two steps , as in fig .",
    "[ reduction ] .",
    "first , we remove the variable with the fastest dynamics , that is , the binary occupancy substrate - enzyme complex @xmath10 .",

    "panel ( c ) shows the final reaction that describes the system at time scales much larger than the characteristic time of evolution of @xmath20 , the number of the substrate molecules on the membrane .",

    ", our derivation for the coarse - graining relies the corresponding moment generation functions ( mgfs ) is the _",

    "one then approximates the distribution of the number of reaction events by a poisson distribution .",
    "unfortunately , not all biochemical processes can be treated in such a simple manner .",
    "for example , due to the single - copy nature of the mm enzyme in our system , fig .",
    "[ reduction](a ) , the instantaneous rate of the product creation is a fast varying function of time , switching between zero and @xmath5 every time binding / unbinding events happen .",
    "therefore , one can not use @xmath18-leaping or langevin schemes @xcite , or treat the product creation as a homogeneous poisson process .",
    "we would like to avoid being forced into the gillespie @xcite or the stochsim @xcite analysis schemes .",
    "since either of these schemes is based on monte - carlo simulations of every individual reaction event , the estimation of parameters of interest may become excessively slow in large systems .    as an alternative",
    ", we will identify good approximations for the distribution of the number of reactions in a fixed time interval , which is no longer a poisson distribution , by characterizing its cgf ( see _ methods : moment generating functions for elementary chemical reactions _ ) . to this end",
    ", we propose to eliminate the binary substrate - enzyme complex variable and reduce the mm reaction triplet to a single reaction , whose dynamics can be considered stationary over times much longer than a single reaction event .",
    "this completes step 1 of the coarse - graining in which each reaction , or a small complex of reactions , is subsumed by a cgf @xmath51 of the distribution of the number of events , which can be considered stationary for extended times .",

    "the price for the coarse graining is that instead of characterizing any reaction by a single rate that defines a poisson distribution of reaction events , one is forced to use a distribution with the prescribed sequence of moments for the monte - carlo simulations .    in principle , generation of such random variables is a difficult and an ill - posed task since the moments do not define the distribution uniquely , and two distributions with matched moments can be arbitrarily different from each other . additionally , once we allow for a nonzero third or fourth cumulant , the remaining higher order cumulants can not be zero anymore@xcite , and the generated random variable will depend on the assumptions made about them . fortunately ,",

    "first , one finds a time scale @xmath54 , small enough for the slow species to be considered as almost static , and yet fast enough for the fast ones to equilibrate .",
    "if the fast species consist only of a few degrees of freedom , like in the case of a single enzyme , one can derive the cgf of the transformations mediated by these species either by using techniques presented in this article ( cf .",
    "_ methods : coarse - graining the michaelis menten reaction _ ) , or discussed previously @xcite .",
    "if instead the fast species are mesoscopic , one can use the stochastic path integral technique to derive the cgf by analogy with step 2 of this article .    at the next step ,",

    "the extremum of the effective hamiltonian determines the cumulant generating function . for hierarchies of time scales",

    "as biology continues to undergo the transformation from a qualitative , descriptive science to a quantitative one , it is expected that more and more rigorous analysis techniques developed in physics , chemistry , mathematics , and engineering will find suitable applications in the biological domain .",
    "this article represents one such example , where adiabatic approach , paired with the stochastic path integral formalism of mesoscopic statistical physics , allows one to coarse - grain stochastic biochemical kinetics systems .    for stiff systems with a pronounced separation of time scales ,",
    "our technique eliminates relatively fast variables .",
    "it reduces stochastic networks to only the relatively slow species , coupled by complex interactions that accounts for the decimated nodes .",
    "the simplified system is smaller , non - stiff , and hence easier to analyze and simulate , resulting , in particular , in orders of magnitude improvement in the computational complexity of the simulations .",
    "thus we believe that the approach has a potential to revolutionize the field of simulations in systems biology , at least for systems with the separation of time scales .",
    "fortunately , such separation occurs more prominently in nature than one would intuitively suspect .",
    "consider for example , the system given in fig .",
    "[ cube ] , briefly mentioned in the _ introduction_. a molecule must be modified on @xmath0 sites in an arbitrary order to move from the inactive ( @xmath110 ) to the active ( @xmath111 ) state . the kinetic diagram for this system",
    "is an @xmath0-dimensional hypercube , and the number of states of the molecule with @xmath112 modified sites is @xmath113 .",

    "modified site , respectively .",

    "( [ fano_f ] ) , approaches unity , suggesting a simplified , yet rigorous , interpretation with the entire reaction replaced by a simple poisson step .",
    "hence the list of relevant , important parameters may be smaller than suggested by the _ ab initio _ description of the system , aiding the understanding of the involved processes and decreasing the effective number of biochemical parameters that must be measured experimentally .",
    "recent theoretical analysis suggests that this may be a universal property of biochemical networks @xcite , with larger networks having proportionally fewer relevant parameters .",
    "thus one may hope that the rigorous identification of the relevant degrees of freedom presented here will become even more powerful as larger , more realistic systems are considered .",
    "we demonstrated the strength of our coarse - graining approach in analytical calculations of the fano factor for the model system ( relevant for single molecule experiments ) , and in numerical simulations , where the method substantially decreased the computational complexity . while impressive , this is still far from being able to coarse - grain large , cellular scale reaction networks .",
    "however , we believe that some important properties of our approach suggest that it may serve as an excellent starting point .",

    "* the stochastic path integral approach can deal with species that have copy numbers of order unity , which are ubiquitous in biological systems .",
    "this is not true for many other coarse - graining techniques . * finally , unlike many previous approaches , the stochastic path integral is rigorous , can be justified mathematically , and allows for controlled approximations .    in the forthcoming publications , we expect to show how these advantageous properties of the adiabatic path integral technique allow to coarse - grain many standard small and medium - sized biochemical networks .",

    "<S> we propose a universal approach for analysis and fast simulations of stiff stochastic biochemical kinetics networks , which rests on elimination of fast chemical species without a loss of information about mesoscopic , non - poissonian fluctuations of the slow ones . </S>",
    "<S> our approach , which is similar to the born - oppenheimer approximation in quantum mechanics , follows from the stochastic path integral representation of the full counting statistics of reaction events ( also known as the cumulant generating function ) . in applications with a small number of chemical reactions , this approach produces analytical expressions for moments of chemical fluxes between slow variables </S>",
    "<S> this allows for a low - dimensional , interpretable representation of the biochemical system , that can be used for coarse - grained numerical simulation schemes with a small computational complexity and yet high accuracy . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a chain of biochemical reactions , derive its coarse - grained description , and show that the gillespie simulations of the original stiff system , the coarse - grained simulations , and the full analytical treatment are in an agreement , but the coarse - grained simulations are three orders of magnitude faster than the gillespie analogue . </S>"
