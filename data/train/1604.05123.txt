    "strong - field physics is concerned with highly nonlinear phenomena originating from the interaction of strong laser radiation with atoms and molecules . above - threshold ionization ( ati ) , high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , and non - sequential double ionization ( nsdi ) are the most well - known examples ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) . among the main theoretical approaches used to understand these diverse phenomena are the direct numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) @xcite , and semiclassical models applying a classical description of an electron after it has been released from an atom , e.g. , by tunneling ionization @xcite .",
    "the most widely known examples of semiclassical approaches are the two - step model for ionization @xcite and the three - step models for harmonic radiation and rescattering @xcite . in the first step of the two - step model an electron tunnels out of an atom , and in the second step it propagates in the laser field .",
    "the third step involves the rescattering of the returning electron with the residual ion .",
    "thus the three - step model allows for a qualitative description of rescattering - induced processes : high - order ati , hhg , and nsdi .",
    "although significant progress has been made over the last two decades in development of the theoretical approaches based on the sfa and , particularly , on the tdse ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , the semiclassical models are still extensively used in strong - field physics .",
    "the reason is that these models have a number of advantages . indeed",
    ", semiclassical simulations can help to identify the specific mechanisms responsible for the phenomena under consideration , and provide an illustrative picture in terms of classical trajectories .",
    "for example , the three - step model explained the cutoffs in hhg @xcite and high - order ati spectra @xcite , the maximum angles in the photoelectron angular distributions @xcite , and the characteristic momenta of recoil ions of the nsdi @xcite .    in their original formulation ,",
    "the two - step and three - step models do not take into account the effect of the coulomb potential of the parent ion on the electron motion after ionization .",
    "the inclusion of the coulomb potential into the two - step model allowed to reveal the so - called coulomb focusing effect @xcite .",
    "employing classical trajectory monte - carlo ( ctmc ) simulations for the second step , the coulomb cusp in the angular distribution of strong - field ionized electrons could be identified @xcite . among the more recent examples of application of the semiclassical models with the coulomb potential",
    "are the investigation of the so - called  ionization surprise \" @xcite , i.e. , the low - energy structures in strong - field ionization by midinfrared pulses @xcite , the study of the angular shifts of the photoelectron momentum distributions in close to circularly polarized laser fields @xcite , and the analysis of the nonadiabatic effects in strong - field ionization ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "semiclassical simulations are often computationally much simpler than the direct numerical solution of the tdse .",
    "there are still many strong - field problems , for which semiclassical models are the only feasible approach .",
    "well known examples of the latter category include the nsdi of atoms by elliptically @xcite and circularly @xcite polarized fields as well as the nsdi of molecules @xcite .",
    "therefore , improvements of the semiclassical models of strong - field phenomena are being sought with the goal to render them quantitatively predictive .",
    "recently , some progress among these lines has been achieved .",
    "for example , a criterion of applicability of the two - step model with the coulomb potential of the parent ion was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite . within a purely classical treatment of the electron dynamics subsequent to tunnel ionization , interference structures in the photoelectron spectrum and two - dimensional momentum distribution @xcite can not be reproduced .",
    "this deficiency has been overcome by a semiclassical model denoted by the authors of @xcite as the `` quantum trajectory monte - carlo ( qtmc ) . ''",
    "this model allows to include interference effects into the two - step model with the coulomb potential .",
    "accordingly , each classical trajectory is associated with a phase determined by the classical action , and the contributions of all trajectories leading to a given final momentum calculated by a ctmc approach are added coherently .",
    "the qtmc model has already been used in the study of nonadiabatic effects in tunneling ionization of atoms in elliptically polarized laser fields @xcite . a similar approach , but disregarding the coulomb potential , was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate the holographic interference patterns in strong - field ionization of n@xmath0 , o@xmath0 , and co@xmath0 .",
    "very recently , the qtmc model has been applied to the identification of resonance structures in the low - energy part of the photoelectron spectra  @xcite and to the study of the nonadiabatic subcycle electron dynamics in orthogonally polarized two - color laser fields @xcite .",
    "the coulomb - corrected strong - field approximation ( ccsfa ) @xcite has been applied to analyze results of experiment and theory .",
    "the ccsfa invokes first - order perturbation theory @xcite to include the coulomb potential . likewise , according to the supplementary material in ref .",
    "@xcite , the qtmc model includes the coulomb effect in a perturbative manner ; a point that we will discuss below .",
    "it is , therefore , of interest to formulate a semiclassical two - step ( scts ) model that accounts for the coulomb potential beyond the semiclassical perturbation theory .",
    "our present approach is based on the theory of semiclassical time - dependent propagators ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a text - book treatment ) . here",
    "we derive a semiclassical expression for the transition amplitude for strong - field ionization that differs from the one used in the qtmc and ccsfa models improving the agreement with full quantum simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "we briefly review previous two - step models that invoke semiclassical approximations at various stages of their development . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we present our semiclassical two - step model that combines the ctmc method for trajectory sampling with the phase of the semiclassical propagator and discuss its numerical implementation .",

    "[ sec4 ] followed by concluding remarks in sec .",
    "atomic units are used throughout the paper unless indicated otherwise .",
    "the two - step models for direct strong - field ionization as well as their three - step extensions typically invoke semiclassical approximations to the full quantum dynamics at various levels .",
    "we briefly sketch the major steps involved in order to delineate the point of departure of the present scts model .",
    "it should be stressed that our model is different from sfa - type models such as the ccsfa model @xcite as the latter are applicable for arbitrary values of the keldysh parameter @xmath1 @xcite ( here @xmath2 is the angular frequency of the laser field , @xmath3 is the field amplitude , and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the ionization potential ) .",
