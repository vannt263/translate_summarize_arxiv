    "the neutron star xmmu j173203.334418 ( hereafter xmmu  j1732 ) belongs to the class of central compact objects ( ccos ) , relatively young cooling neutron stars in supernova remnants .",
    "ccos possess relatively low dipole - like large - scale surface magnetic fields ( @xmath0 g ) and show thermal emission in soft x - rays .",
    "xmmu  j1732  was discovered in 2007 with _ xmm - newton _ @xcite near the center of the hess j1731347",

    "spectral fits of the x - ray emission from xmmu  j1732  with traditional black - body and hydrogen atmosphere models yielded radius of the emitting region much lower than typical radii of neutron stars for the plausible distance to the source of 35kpc .",
    "these results might have been interpreted as the radiation from a hot spot on the neutron star surface .",
    "however , no pulsations have been detected from xmmu  j1732  so far which would imply a very special geometry in which either the spot is aligned with the spin axis of the star or the spin axis is directed along the line of sight .",
    "this uncomfortable explanation was questioned by @xcite .",
    "the authors fitted the spectra with the carbon atmosphere model and showed that such fits lead to the radius of the emitting region comparable to a typical radius of neutron stars .",
    "if so , the observed radiation can be interpreted as the thermal radiation emergent from the entire neutron star surface .",
    "we adopt this explanation here .",
    "we note , that xmmu  j1732  is the second cco where the carbon atmosphere is used to explain the observed emission properties , after the neutron star in the cassiopeia  a supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "the next important step was done by @xcite , hereafter paper i , who analyzed longer observations of xmmu  j1732  with _ xmm - newton _ and fitted the entire dataset with the carbon atmosphere model computed by @xcite .",
    "they analyzed different assumptions on the distance @xmath1 to the star and concluded that @xmath2  kpc seems most realistic ( although other possibilities are not excluded ) . assuming @xmath2  kpc they obtained sufficiently narrow confident regions for the neutron star mass and radius .",
    "as for the neutron star age @xmath3 , they took @xmath4 kyr from @xcite and added ( rather arbitrarily ) an uncertainty range of 1040 kyr as the age might in fact be lower .",
    "we adopt these values here and apply the elaborated cooling model to analyze the data .",

    "theoretically , such a cooling can be explained ( paper  i ) by ( i ) a strong suppression of neutrino emission from the stellar core and ( ii ) assuming a massive carbon heat blanketing envelope .",

    "\\(i ) no enhanced neutrino cooling mechanism such as direct urca process @xcite or neutrino emission due to triplet - state cooper pairing of neutrons ( @xcite ; also see @xcite and references therein ) can operate in the xmmu  j1732  core .",
    "the enhanced emission would make the star colder than it is .",
    "in particular , the core can not contain any wide layer of superfluid neutrons .    moreover , even if the standard neutrino emission due to the modified urca ( mu ) process operated in the stellar core , the star would have been insufficiently hot .",
    "this is shown by the solid cooling curve mu in fig .",

    "the star is supposed to have the standard heat blanketing envelope made of iron ( with a thin carbon atmosphere on top ) . according to fig .",
    "[ f : cool ] and table [ tab : xmmu ] , the mu model can not explain the observations of xmmu  j1732 .",
    "the model implies that the star is non - superfluid ; in addition to the mu processes , weaker processes of neutrino emission in neutron - neutron ( nn ) , neutron - proton ( np ) and proton - proton ( pp ) collisions ( called neutrino - pair bremsstrahlung in nucleon - nucleon collisions ) also operate in the core but do not affect the cooling .",
    "the neutrino emission of the star can be further reduced by strong proton superfluidity in the stellar core .",
    "it greatly suppresses the neutrino reactions involving protons which are the mu - process and the weaker neutrino processes of pp and np collisions .",
    "however , the neutrino emission of non - superfluid neutrons in nn collisions survives ; it is 30100 times weaker than the mu process .",
    "the cooling scenario sf is for the star with strong proton superfluidity and iron heat blanket .",
    "the star becomes noticeably hotter than the mu star , but still insufficiently hot to explain the data .",
    "\\(ii ) the second powerful regulator of the xmmu  j1732  surface temperature is the amount of carbon ( generally , of accreted matter containing light elements ",
    "@xcite ) in the heat blanketing envelope .",
    "the thermal conductivity of the carbon envelope is higher than that of the iron one ; at the same internal temperature the surface temperature becomes higher .",
    "model muac is for a non - superfluid star with nearly maximum possible mass of carbon @xmath15 in the envelope ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the surface temperature of a non - superfluid star becomes noticeably higher than that for the mu model , but it is still not high enough . finally , model sfac is for the superfluid star with the maximum mass of carbon in the envelope .",

    "this is because xmmu  j1732  cools via neutrinos from inside .",
    "accordingly , the presence of carbon in the heat blanket just increases @xmath5 making the surface hotter without any back reaction on the neutron star interiors .",
    "it is worth to mention that the cooling scenarios sf and sfac can also be realized if direct urca process is formally allowed in xmmu  j1732  for a given eos but is exponentially suppressed by very strong proton superfluidity ( similar situations are described , e.g. , by @xcite ) .",

    "such superfluidity completely suppresses the mu , np and pp processes of neutrino cooling so that the star cools via the neutrino emission in nn collisions .",
    "in addition , strong proton superfluidity fully suppresses the proton heat capacity . in both cases @xmath31 and @xmath32 . then @xmath33 the factor @xmath34 ( to be expressed in k  s@xmath35 ) depends on @xmath36 , @xmath37 and eos in the stellar core ( see below ) ; @xmath38 .    the cooling equation ( [ e : cool ] ) with the neutrino cooling function ( [ eq_cooling1 ] ) after reaching the state of internal thermal relaxation of the star gives the well known analytic solution ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath39 where @xmath3 has to be expressed in seconds ; we insert the normalization temperature @xmath40  k to ensure proper dimensions of @xmath34 and @xmath3 .",

    "accordingly , one can further reduce the @xmath36@xmath37 range allowed by cooling models ( shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] ) by removing the region of rather high masses .",
    "however , this additional restriction of the cooling models requires further consideration .",
    "generally , cooling theories predict that massive stars can not be very hot . in principle , the direct urca process can be suppressed by strong superfluidity but the existence of strong superfluidity in central parts of massive stars is unlikely on theoretical grounds ( see above ) .",
    "however , xmmu  j1732  can be a moderate - mass star , with the direct urca process formally allowed but exponentially suppressed by strong superfluidity .",

    "now we can combine the mass - radius constraints given by spectral fits ( fig .",
    "[ f : eoses ] ) and the cooling theory ( fig.[fig : contours ] ) .",
    "one example of such analysis is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : obstheor ] . to be specific ,",
    "we take the 68 per cent banana - like confidence region of @xmath36 and @xmath37 from fig.[f : eoses ] . for certainty",

    "let us mention that if we used only realistic theoretical eoss of neutron stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) to reduce the banana - like region , we would do similar reduction .",
    "the joint region allowed by the observed spectra and cooling models is densely shaded in fig .",
    "[ f : obstheor ] .",
    "the cooling models disfavor very low and very large radii ( both ends on the banana ) , just in accordance with theoretical expectations .",
    "notice that the best fit @xmath36 and @xmath37 obtained from the spectral fits ( the cross in figs .",
    "[ f : eoses ] , [ fig : contours ] and [ f : obstheor ] ) appear to be near the center of the densely shaded region .    our analysis based on fig .",
    "[ f : obstheor ] is evidently not strict because we have assumed specific values of @xmath99 @xmath111 and specific minimal @xmath116 .",
    "we could slightly increase @xmath88 ( up to its maximum value @xmath117 @xmath111 ) which would widen the range of @xmath36 and @xmath37 provided by the cooling models at @xmath115 ( left - hand panel on fig .",

    "if we slightly decrease @xmath88 below @xmath118 @xmath111 , the @xmath89 range allowed by the cooling models with @xmath115 will shift to higher @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( outside the banana range , where , in addition , the existence of exceptionally hot xmmu  j1732  is questionable due to possible opening of the direct urca process ) . in principle",
    ", we could take the minimum value of @xmath57 lower than 1/60 .",
    "this would increase the @xmath89 range allowed by the cooling models but very low @xmath57 seem unrealistic ( as explained above ) .",
    "all in all , although we have presented only one example of chosen @xmath88 and @xmath57 , we have actually not much freedom to vary the parameters and be consistent with the observations .",
    "we have extended the cooling theory of neutron stars to study a very slow cooling of exceptionally hot middle - aged stars .",
    "such a cooling can take place ( e.g. , paper i ) under the effects of strong proton superfluidity in stellar cores ( to suppress internal neutrino cooling ) and large amount of sufficiently light elements in the heat blanketing envelopes ( to increase the heat transparency of the envelopes and rise the surface temperature ) .",
    "we have presented simple expressions ( [ eq_tg - t ] ) , ( [ eq_reductdef ] ) , ( [ eq_f - ps ] ) and ( [ eq_f - do ] ) which enable fast and accurate calculation of the internal temperature @xmath10 of a very slowly cooling neutron star as a function of age @xmath3 at the neutrino cooling stage .",
    "the expressions are obtained for neutron stars with nucleon cores , where protons can be in a superfluid state .",
    "the expressions are universal , valid for many eoss of nucleon matter . equations ( [ eq_f - ps ] ) and ( [ eq_f - do ] ) are derived by fitting the results of numerical calculations for many eoss .",
    "equation ( [ eq_f - do ] ) takes into account a very slow ( but finite ) neutrino cooling in the presence of strong proton superfluidity which has not been calculated earlier . the effect of proton superfluidity",
    "is described by one parameter @xmath57 which is the suppression factor of the neutrino cooling of the star with respect to a standard neutrino candle . in our case",
    "the cooling is regulated by neutron star mass @xmath36 , radius @xmath37 , factor @xmath57 , and by the amount of light elements in the heat blanketing envelope .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that it is universal and does not depend on a specific model for proton superfluidity .",
    "all the information on proton superfluidity is contained in @xmath57 .",
    "it is @xmath57 which can be inferred from observations ; allowable models of @xmath119 to ensure this @xmath57 can be analyzed later .",
    "these models can describe the cases in which a non - superfluid star would cool mainly via modified or even direct urca process but both urca processes are greatly suppressed by proton superfluidity . in this sense",
    "our consideration extends model - independent analysis of cooling neutron stars with standard cooling function @xmath120 , started by @xcite and @xcite , and a more complicated model - independent analysis of the cooling enhanced by the onset of triplet - state pairing of neutrons and associated neutrino emission in the neutron star core @xcite .",
    "the cooling model has been applied to interpret the observations of thermal radiation of the xmmu  j1732  neutron star in the supernova remnant hess j1731347 .",
    "a preliminary interpretation was presented in paper i. following paper i we have assumed the carbon atmosphere models , the distance @xmath2  kpc , and the neutron star age @xmath4  kyr . the modified theory has noticeably improved the interpretation of observations .",
    "we have obtained that the reasonable values of @xmath57 should be around 1/60 and the heat blanketing envelope should contain a lot of carbon , up to the density @xmath121  @xmath111 . the theory has allowed us to strongly restrict the range of masses and radii of xmmu  j1732  ( see the densely shaded region in fig .  [",
    "f : obstheor ] ) in comparison with the ranges obtained from spectral fits .",
    "nevertheless we would like to warn the reader that that these results can be considered as semi - quantitative .",
    "for instance , strictly speaking , the factor @xmath57 can vary with time ( larger layers of the core become superfluid ) .",
    "we have neglected this effect assuming it is weak . moreover , owing to the strong temperature dependence of the neutrino cooling function @xmath29 ( section  [ s : coolfun ] ) , the values of @xmath57 which we infer from the observations are very sensitive to the measured values of @xmath5 and to a not very certain microphysics of the neutron star matter . in particular , they are sensitive to the thermal insulation of the heat blanketing envelopes ( to the relation between the surface and internal temperatures ) .",
    "another example ",
    "our equations ( [ eq_f - ps ] ) and ( [ eq_f - do ] ) are obtained using certain expressions ( e.g. , @xcite ) for the neutrino emission in the modified urca process and nucleon - nucleon collisions ( table [ tab : xmmu ] ) .",
    "although these expressions are widely used in cooling simulations , they are model dependent .",
    "were the theory of neutrino processes improved ( first of all , with regard to matrix elements of the processes ) , equations ( [ eq_f - ps ] ) and ( [ eq_f - do ] ) should have been updated which may change the results .",
    "in addition , our consideration is based on the age of xmmu  j1732  equal to 27  kyr .",
    "however , one can not exclude that the age is different which would affect the results . if the age were larger ,",
    "say , 40 kyr , our cooling model would still be able to explain the data but assuming the strongest proton superfluidity and fully carbon blanketing envelope .",
    "were the age lower ( e.g. , as low as 10 kyr ) the situation would be more relaxed , than at @xmath4 kyr , but we would still need both , strong superfluidity and massive carbon envelope . to become an ` ordinary ' cooling neutron star ( instead of extraordinary hot one ) its age should be @xmath122 kyr .",
    "the distance to xmmu  j1732  is also not very certain . were @xmath123 kpc instead of 3.2 kpc , the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 inferred from the spectral fits would be noticeable higher , not very realistic for neutron stars , and the inferred surface temperature would also be slightly higher ( paper i ) .",
    "although there is no rigorous proof , it is widely believed that such a very massive star should cool rapidly , in disagreement with the inferred @xmath5 .",
