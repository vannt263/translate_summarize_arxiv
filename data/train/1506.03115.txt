    "icecube is a cubic - kilometer - sized neutrino detector installed in the ice at the geographic south pole between depths of 1450 m and 2450 m @xcite .",
    "it consists of an array of photon sensors , called digital optical modules ( doms ) , attached to 86 cables , called strings .",
    "detector construction started in 2005 and finished in december 2010 .",
    "neutrino observation relies on the optical detection of cherenkov radiation emitted by secondary particles produced in neutrino interactions in ice or bedrock near icecube . due to the small neutrino interaction cross - section",
    ", the kilometer - scale detector has an effective area of only for muon neutrinos of energy @xcite . as part of the optical follow - up ( ofu ) program , the icecube neutrino observatory records high - energy ( @xmath1 ) neutrino events at a rate of about @xmath2 , about 250 per day .",
    "those events are mostly ( @xmath3 ) cosmic - ray induced neutrinos from the atmosphere , referred to as atmospheric neutrinos , with about a 10% contamination of cosmic - ray induced atmospheric muons .",
    "routine neutrino analyses in icecube , which are referred to as _ offline _ analyses , are performed after a certain amount of data , e.g.  one or several years , has been collected .",
    "they benefit from events being put through computationally expensive reconstructions , as well as information on detector performance that become available only days or weeks after data acquisition . in contrast",
    ", neutrino analyses running _ online _ will not have access to such information , but have the advantage of being near real - time ",
    "results are available with a latency of @xmath4 .",
    "with such a short latency neutrino analysis , multi - wavelength follow - up observations can be triggered by neutrino events .",
    "these follow - up data have the potential to reveal the electromagnetic counterpart of a transient neutrino source , which might otherwise be missed and thus be unavailable for further observations .",
    "in addition , the coincident detection of neutrino and electromagnetic emission can be statistically more significant and provide more information about the physics of the source than the neutrino detection alone .",
    "another advantage of an online analysis is the prompt availability of the reconstructed neutrino dataset and thus the possibility of fast response analyses .",
    "thus , icecube s online neutrino analysis efforts have also enabled fast @xmath5-ray burst ( grb ) searches like the one following grb 130427a , published in a gcn circular @xcite .    the online search for short transient neutrino sources ( order of @xmath6 ) is mostly motivated by models of neutrinos from long duration grbs @xcite and from choked jet supernovae ( sne ) @xcite .",
    "the two source classes are related : both are thought to host a jet , which is highly relativistic in case of long grbs , but only mildly relativistic in case of choked jet sne .",
    "long grb progenitors are conceived to be wolf - rayet stars that have lost their outer hydrogen and helium envelope @xcite , while choked jet sne can still have those outer layers @xcite which are important for efficient high - energy ( he ) neutrino production .",
    "the choked jet is more baryon - rich and has a much lower lorentz factor @xmath7 than the grb jet with @xmath8 .",
    "it can not penetrate the stellar envelope and remains optically thick , making it invisible in @xmath5-rays .",
    "the neutrinos produced at energies can escape nevertheless and may trigger the discovery of the sn in other channels . in particular , for a bright nearby sn , a neutrino detection would enable the acquisition of optical data during the rise of the light curve , strengthening the time correlation between the neutrino burst and the optical supernova via the improved estimate of the explosion time @xcite .",
    "mildly relativistic jets may occur in a much larger fraction of core - collapse sne than highly relativistic jets , i.e.  grbs @xcite .",
    "detections of neutrinos from grbs and choked jet sne would be a remarkable discovery and could provide important insight into the supernova - grb connection and the underlying jet physics @xcite .",
    "both sources are expected to emit a short , about long burst of neutrinos @xcite either before or at the time of the @xmath5-ray burst ( if detectable ) @xcite , setting the natural time scale of the neutrino search .",
    "after recording the neutrino burst , follow - up observations can be used to identify the counterpart of the transient neutrino source .",
    "a @xmath5-ray burst can be identified either via the prompt @xmath5-ray emission lasting up to about @xmath9 @xcite or via the optical and x - ray afterglow lasting up to several hours @xcite .",
    "the latter involves instruments of limited field of view and thus requires telescope slew , but has the advantage of much better angular resolution well below an arc minute @xcite . a fast response within minutes to hours",
    "is required for a grb afterglow follow - up .",
    "a choked jet sn is found by detecting a shock breakout or a sn light curve in the follow - up images , slowly rising and then declining within weeks after the neutrino burst . following this scientific motivation , an online neutrino analysis , targeted at sn and grb afterglow detection ,",
    "was installed at icecube in 2008 ( see section  [ sec : ofu ] ) .",
    "in addition to the transient neutrino emission within , as discussed above , sne can be promising sources of high - energy neutrinos over longer time scales . in this paper ,",
    "the class of type iin sne @xcite is explored further .",
    "these are core - collapse sne embedded in a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) that was ejected in a pre - explosion phase .",
    "following the explosion , the sn ejecta plow through the dense csm and collisionless shocks can form and accelerate particles , which may create high - energy neutrinos .",
    "this is comparable to a sn remnant , but on a much shorter time scale of @xcite .",
    "sne iin ( `` n '' for narrow ) are spectrally characterized by the presence of strong emission lines , most notably h@xmath10 , that have a narrow component , together with blue continuum emission @xcite .",
    "the narrow component is interpreted to originate from surrounding hii regions , and the generally slow spectral evolution is due to the presence of a high - density csm @xcite . since interaction of the sn ejecta with the dense csm can lead to the conversion of a large fraction of the ejecta s kinetic energy to radiation , sne iin are on average more luminous than other sne ii @xcite .",
    "they generally fade quite slowly and some belong to the most luminous sne @xcite .",
    "there is much diversity within the subclass of sne iin @xcite , both spectroscopically and photometrically , which can be explained by a diversity of progenitor stars and mass loss histories prior to explosion @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been observations of eruptions prior to sn iin explosions associated with mass loss which explain the existence of the dense csm shells ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report the discovery of a type iin sn in the optical observations triggered by an icecube neutrino alert from march 2012 , and analyze the available neutrino and electromagnetic observations .",
    "the sn is already at a late stage at the time of the neutrino detection , which means that the neutrino - sn connection is presumably coincidental .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : ofu ] introduces the optical follow - up system of icecube .",
    "section  [ sec : alert ] gives details about the neutrino alert triggering the follow - up observations that led to the sn discovery .",
    "section  [ sec : highenergy ] reports limits from a complementary offline neutrino search and x - ray limits .",
    "the uv and optical data that were obtained are discussed in depth in section  [ sec : lowenergy ] .",
    "we finally summarize the results and give a conclusion in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in late 2008 , an online neutrino event selection was set up at icecube , looking for muons produced by charged current interactions of muon neutrinos in or near the icecube detector .",
    "the analysis is running in real - time within the limited computing resources at the south pole , capable of reconstructing and filtering the neutrinos and sending alerts to follow - up instruments with a latency of only a few minutes @xcite .",
    "the optical ( ofu ) and x - ray ( xfu ) real - time follow - up programs currently encompass three follow - up instruments : the robotic optical transient search experiment ( rotse ) @xcite , the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) @xcite and the swift satellite @xcite .",
    "these triggered observations were supplemented with a retrospective search through the pan - starrs1 3@xmath11 survey data @xcite , which is discussed further in section  [ sec : lowenergy ] .",
    "in addition , there is also a real - time @xmath5-ray follow - up program ( gfu ) targeting slower transients ( time scale of weeks ) , e.g.  flaring active galactic nuclei , that is sending alerts to the @xmath5-ray telescopes magic and veritas @xcite .",
    "the background of cosmic - ray induced muons from the atmosphere above the detector amounts to @xmath12 muon events per neutrino event . in a first step ,",
    "it is reduced by limiting the sample to the northern hemisphere , using the earth as a muon shield and selecting only muon tracks that are reconstructed as up - going in the detector .",
    "afterwards , cuts on quality parameters similar to those in @xcite are applied to reject mis - reconstructed muon events : after an initial removal of likely noise signals , a chain of reconstructions is performed , which utilizes the spatial and temporal distribution of recorded photons on the doms . starting with a simple linear track algorithm , more advanced",
    "reconstructions are employed , seeded with the respective preceding reconstruction .",
    "the advanced reconstructions maximize a likelihood that accounts for the optical properties of the ice for photon propagation @xcite .",
    "the final reconstruction in this chain is used to select events that are up - going in the detector . at this point , because of the vast amount of atmospheric muons , the data are still dominated by ( down - going ) muons that are mis - reconstructed as up - going . to reject this remaining background ,",
    "high quality events are selected , where the selection parameters are derived from the value of the maximized track likelihood and from the number and geometry of recorded signals with a detection time compatible with unscattered photon propagation .",
    "alternatively , events with a large number of total recorded photon signals are selected .",
    "the resulting analysis sample has an event rate of about @xmath2 , of which @xmath3 are atmospheric muon neutrinos that have passed through the earth and @xmath13 are contamination of cosmic - ray induced muons from the atmosphere .    in the analysis sample ,",
    "the median angular resolution of the neutrino direction is about for a multi - tev muon neutrino charged current interaction event , and or less for and higher energies .",
    "the angular resolution of the sample is estimated using monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "additionally , an estimator of the directional uncertainty is computed for each event , which is based on the shape of the reconstruction likelihood close to the found maximum @xcite .",
    "it is calibrated such that its median matches the mc derived angular resolution .",
    "we define the _ bulk _ of a sample as events within the central 90% of the energy distribution .",
    "the bulk of the main background contained in the analysis sample , atmospheric neutrinos , has energies between and .",
    "in contrast , the bulk of signal events from an unbroken @xmath14 power - law spectrum would have energies @xmath15 .",
    "signal neutrinos from grbs are expected to follow a spectrum similar to @xmath14 , which has cut - off energies between @xmath16 to @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "choked jet sne are predicted to have lower cut - off energies around @xcite so that the overlap with atmospheric neutrinos is presumably much larger , while iin neutrinos may have higher cut - offs of ( see section  [ sec : offline ] ) .    in order to suppress background from atmospheric neutrinos ,",
    "a multiplet of at least two neutrinos within 100 seconds and angular separation of or less is required to trigger an alert .",
    "in addition , since 2011 mid - september , a test statistic is used , providing a single parameter for selection of the most significant alerts .",
    "it was derived as the analytic maximization of a likelihood ratio following @xcite , for the special case of a neutrino doublet with rich signal content : @xmath18 where the time between the neutrinos in the doublet is denoted as @xmath19 , and their angular separation as @xmath20 .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend on the event - by - event directional uncertainties @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the two neutrino events , typically @xmath25 .",
    "the angle @xmath26 corresponds to the circularized angular radius of the field of view ( fov ) of the follow - up telescope .",
    "it is set to @xmath27 for swift and @xmath28 for rotse and ptf .",
    "the test statistic @xmath29 is smaller for more signal - like alerts , which have small separation @xmath20 , small time difference @xmath19 and a high chance to lie in the fov of the telescope .",
    "thus , @xmath29 is a useful parameter to separate signal and background alerts . for each follow - up program , a specific cut on @xmath29",
    "is applied in order to send the most significant alerts to the follow - up instruments . in the 2011/12 data acquisition ( daq ) season , which is discussed here , a cut of @xmath30 was used for the rotse follow - up , while cut values of and were used for ptf and swift .",
    "multiplets of multiplicity higher than two are passed directly to all follow - up instruments . since the expected background rate is low ( @xmath31 per year ) , each observation of a triplet or higher order multiplet is significant by itself .    *",
    "rotse * @xcite is a network of four optical telescopes with aperture and @xmath32 fov , located in australia , texas , namibia and turkey . since late 2012 , only the two northern hemisphere telescopes continue operation .",
    "rotse is a completely automatic and autonomous system that can receive alerts , perform observations and send resulting data without requiring human interaction .",
    "the limiting magnitude of @xmath33   is however insufficient to discover faint or far sne .",
    "for instance , for a very bright sn with absolute magnitude , the detection radius is about , while a faint sn with is only visible within a radius of .",
    "icecube has been sending @xmath34 alerts per year to rotse , since 2008 december .",

    "icecube s x - ray follow - up program triggers swift s xrt , which can provide valuable information by observing a grb afterglow in x - rays .",
    "the xrt has a fov of only @xmath40 in diameter , hence swift performs seven pointings for each icecube follow - up , resulting in an effective fov of about in diameter .",

    "deviations ) was recorded and sent to rotse and ptf simultaneously .",
    "the significance was also above the threshold for swift ( @xmath44 ) , however it was within swift s moon proximity constraint , which delayed the observations by three weeks .",

    "therefore , it is highly unlikely that the neutrinos were produced by a jet at the sn site , as this is expected to happen immediately after core collapse in the choked jet scenario @xcite .    however , steady neutrino emission on a time scale of several months is a possibility and explored in section  [ sec : offline ] .",

    ", the broad line component is emitted from shocked sn ejecta expanding in a relatively rarefied wind , while the intermediate component arises from a shocked dense part of the wind , which can either consist of dense clumps or be a dense equatorial wind @xcite .",
    "this is an indication of ejecta - csm interaction .",
    "the intermediate and broad component of the early spectrum s h@xmath10 line are blueshifted which may indicate formation of dust , as explored by @xcite for sn 2010jl . a more recent study by @xcite , the most comprehensive work on the sn 2010jl emission line blueshifts to date , finds very strong evidence for a wavelength dependence of the blueshift .",
    "therefore , the authors conclude that the origin of the blueshifts is most likely the rapid formation of large dust grains , confirming @xcite and having implications on the origin of dust in galaxies .",
    "alternatively , @xcite explain the line blueshift in sn 2010jl with a bulk velocity of the emitting gas towards the observer .",
    "this is more consistent with observations if the spectral lines are symmetric about a center and if there is no wavelength dependence of the blueshift .",
    "the bulk velocity is believed to be the result of radiative acceleration of the gas by flux from the sn .",
    "presumably , there are also other possible explanations for the blueshift , e.g.  the geometry or density structure of the csm . in case of sn ptf12csy ,",
    "spectral line blueshift is only clearly visible in the h@xmath10 line , prohibiting the interpretation of the blueshift in favor of any scenario .    the late spectrum s",
    "h@xmath10 line has a much more complicated structure than the early spectrum s .",
    "it does not peak at zero velocity anymore , but the peak is blueshifted and there are many sub - peaks .",
    "again , the blueshift might be connected to dust formation or radiative gas acceleration , but other reasons are conceivable as well .",
    "at least part of the late h@xmath10 line s complex appearance might be due to superposition of other spectral lines , e.g.  nii .",
    "apart from that , it is an indication of an inhomogeneous , maybe clumpy , csm structure , and perhaps asymmetric sn explosion .",
    "the spectra are compared to template spectra from the padova - asiago supernova archive ( asa ) @xcite using the online tool gelato .",
    "the algorithm @xcite divides a spectrum into 11 relevant bins and averages within the bins to classify and compare with the archived spectra .",
    "the ptf12csy spectra are de - reddened with @xmath209 and compared to other type ii sne .",
    "gelato returns the best 30 matching spectra together with their phases , ordered by quality of fit .",
    "for both the gemini north spectrum taken at and the keck i spectrum from , the majority of best matching template spectra come from sn 2010jl .",
    "the mean phase of the matching spectra is significantly higher for the keck i spectrum : , versus for the gemini n spectrum .",
    "however , the reference dates for the spectra are mostly the discovery date , only rarely the date of maximum light or explosion date .",
    "the galaxy hosting ptf12csy is a faint dwarf galaxy designated sdss j065832.82 + 171541.6 , barely visible in the sdss dr12 images .",
    "since it has no cataloged redshift , we measure its redshift via oii @xmath202 and oiii @xmath210 lines in the keck i spectrum .",
    "the redshift is , corresponding to a luminosity distance of @xmath211 assuming standard cosmology with hubble parameter @xmath212 , matter density @xmath168 , and dark energy density @xmath169 .    adopting the luminosity distance from above",
    ", the host galaxy has absolute magnitudes of @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215(corrected for galactic extinction ) . using the luminosity - metallicity relation from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  1 ) , we find a metallicity of @xmath216 , indicating that the host galaxy is quite metal - poor .",
    "overluminous sne iin , such as ptf12csy , have been preferentially found to occur in subluminous , low - metallicity galaxies @xcite , such as the host of ptf12csy .",
    "this is a trend , which is also observed for long grbs @xcite .",
    "statistics are still low and @xcite cautioned that there could be some selection bias due to intrinsically bright sne in faint host galaxies being more easily discovered during surveys doing aperture photometry . however , new surveys performing image subtraction and observing large untargeted fields , e.g. ptf and pan - starrs , provide increasing evidence for this trend , as most of the discovered bright objects would have been luminous enough to be detected in bright galaxies and in searches that are targeted to bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "ptf12csy , probably discovered by coincidence in an unbiased way , confirms this emerging trend as well .",
    "the sdss dr12has the host galaxy s cataloged center position about away from the found sn position ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : subtraction ] ) . with an apparent diameter of about ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath217 , this is quite far from the center of the galaxy , i.e.about off - center .",
    "the highest significance alert from the icecube optical follow - up program led to a coincidental discovery of the interesting and unusual type iin sn ptf12csy , which was already at least 169 days old .",
    "the combined _ a posteriori _ significance of the neutrino doublet alert and the coincident detection of any core - collapse sn within the error radius of the neutrino events ( ) and within the luminosity distance of the sn ( ) is , for the time interval of the icecube data acquisition season 2011/12 .",
    "ptf12csy is rare and unusual : with peak absolute magnitudes of @xmath218 , perhaps about -20 , it belongs to the most luminous sne .",
    "the sn is most likely powered by interaction of the ejecta with a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "the spectrum indicates a complicated structure of the csm . its host galaxy is a faint and metal - poor dwarf galaxy , confirming an observed trend for luminous sne iin .",
    "ptf12csy is similar in photometry and spectroscopy to other rare luminous sne iin , e.g.  sne 2008iy and 2010jl .",
    "the total radiated energy is within the first 400 rest frame days after detection .    given the ejecta - csm interaction , high - energy ( he ) cosmic ray production and neutrino emission may be expected on a time scale of , according to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the sn is too far away for icecube to detect this emission .",
    "a complementary neutrino analysis performed offline , using one year of icecube data which cover most of the optical sn fluence , does not reveal a signal - like accumulation of neutrino events from the sn s position , leading to a very high upper limit of more than 1000 times the tested model fluence , owing to the large distance .",
    "due to the long delay of several months between explosion date and neutrinos , the doublet of neutrinos within less than two seconds can not be explained by the formation of a jet shortly after core - collapse according to the choked jet model @xcite . nor can it be explained by the expected he neutrino production from ejecta - csm interaction of sne iin ( s.a . ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the only reasonable explanation is that the sn detection was coincidental and the neutrino doublet was produced by uncorrelated background events of atmospheric neutrinos and/or mis - reconstructed atmospheric muons .",
    "however , if there was a delaying mechanism at work , such as the spin - down of a supramassive neutron star that delays its collapse to a black hole , as in the blitzar model @xcite , then the neutrino doublet may have originated from a jet forming in the course of this delayed collapse few hundred days after sn explosion .",
    "the coincidental detection of a type iin sn following an icecube neutrino alert demonstrates the capability of the follow - up system to reveal transient he neutrino sources .",
    "an advantage of the follow - up paradigm is the prompt availability of multi - messenger information for the identification of the source , as well as the mere statistical significance of a coincidence between a neutrino burst and an electromagnetic transient detection . in this case",
    ", the significance is very low due to the delay of several months between explosion and neutrinos .",
    "however , this coincidence motivates the continuation of the follow - up program as well as further stacked neutrino analyses of type iin supernovae .",
