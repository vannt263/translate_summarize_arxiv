    "the goal of the ultra - relativistic nuclear collision program is the creation of a system of deconfined quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy of the transverse momentum distribution for non - central collisions is thought to be sensitive to the early evolution of the system .",
    "the second fourier coefficient of this anisotropy , @xmath4 , is called elliptic flow .",
    "it is an important observable since it is sensitive to the rescattering of the constituents in the created hot and dense matter .",
    "this rescattering converts the initial spatial anisotropy , due to the almond shape of the overlap region of non - central collisions , into momentum anisotropy .",
    "the spatial anisotropy is largest early in the evolution of the collision , but as the system expands and becomes more spherical , this driving force quenches itself .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of the observed elliptic flow reflects the extent of the rescattering at early time  @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions was first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been studied intensively in recent years at ags  @xcite , sps  @xcite and rhic  @xcite energies .",
    "the studies at the top ags energy and at sps energies have found that elliptic flow at these energies is in the plane defined by the beam direction and the impact parameter , @xmath5 , as expected from most models .    the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star )  @xcite measures charged particles , and due to its azimuthal symmetry and large coverage , it is ideally suited for measuring elliptic flow .",
    "the detector consists of several sub - systems in a large solenoidal magnet .",
    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath6 for collisions in the center of the tpc .",
    "the magnet is operated at a 0.25 tesla field , allowing tracking of particles with @xmath7  mev / c .",
    "two zero degree calorimeters  @xcite located at @xmath8 2 mrad , which mainly detect fragmentation neutrons , are used in coincidence for the trigger .",
    "the tpc is surrounded by a scintillator barrel which measures the charged particle multiplicity for triggering purposes within @xmath9 .    for this analysis ,",
    "120,000 events were selected with a primary vertex position within 75  cm longitudinally of the tpc center and within 1  cm radially of the beam line .",
    "for determination of the event plane , charged particle tracks were selected with @xmath10 gev / c .",
    "the tracks used to determine the event plane and the tracks correlated with the event plane passed within 2  cm of the primary vertex and had at least 15 measured space points . also , the ratio of the number of space points to the expected maximum number of space points for that particular track was required to be greater than 0.52 , suppressing split tracks from being counted more than once .",
    "the tracks used for the determination of the reaction plane were within @xmath11 , and the tracks correlated with the reaction plane were within @xmath12 .",
    "these cuts are similar to the ones used in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the analysis results are not sensitive to the cuts .",

    "the peaked shape of the centrality dependence of @xmath14\\rangle$ ] is a signature of anisotropic flow .",
    "however , the correlation between the sub - events may not be due entirely to anisotropic flow . to estimate the magnitude of non - flow effects",
    "we have chosen the sub - events in three different ways : 1 ) assigning particles with pseudorapidity @xmath15 to one sub - event and particles with @xmath16 to the other .",

    "3 ) assigning positive particles to one sub - event and negative particles to the other , allowing an estimation of the contribution from resonance decays . in fig .",
    "[ methods ] the resulting @xmath1 versus centrality from each of these methods is shown .",
    "the charged particles were integrated over @xmath17 gev/@xmath3 and @xmath12 .",
    "the results from the three methods are for the central and mid - peripheral events very similar . however , for the most peripheral events the results vary among the methods by about 0.005 .     from top ags to rhic energies.,scaledwidth=110.0% ]     from top ags to rhic energies.,scaledwidth=110.0% ]",
    "not all non - flow contributions might be known and the effects of others , such as jets , are difficult to estimate because of their long - range correlation .",
    "recently new methods to estimate these non - flow effects have become available  @xcite . in order to estimate the systematic uncertainty due to the effects of jets in this analysis",
    ", we assume that jets contribute at the same level to both the first and second order correlations .",
    "this assumption is verified by the hijing  @xcite model .",
    "taking the maximum observed positive first order correlation , 0.05 , as being completely due to non - flow will reduce the calculated @xmath1 values .",
    "figure  [ errors ] shows @xmath1 versus centrality , where the statistical uncertainties are smaller than the markers and the uncertainties shown are the systematic uncertainties due to this estimated non - flow effect .",

    "it rises monotonically from about 0.02 at the top ags energy  @xcite , 0.035 at the sps  @xcite to about 0.06 at rhic energies  @xcite .",
    "this increasing magnitude of the integrated elliptic flow indicates that the degree of thermalization , which is associated with the amount of rescattering , is higher at the higher beam energies .",
    "however , interpretation of the excitation function has to be done with care .",
    "the @xmath1 values used here are the maximum values as a function of centrality for each energy .",

    "the @xmath1(@xmath2 ) above 2 gev/@xmath3 can be described by medium induced radiative energy loss of high @xmath2 partons ( jet quenching )  @xcite .",
