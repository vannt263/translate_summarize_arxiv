    ".    production of high transverse momentum jets is a hard process which implies a head - on collision of qcd partons  quarks and/or gluons  from the small - distance wave functions of initial hadrons .",
    "cross section of a hard collision is small compared with the size of hadron , @xmath6 , with @xmath5 the scale related to transverse momenta of the produced jets , @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , typically it is two partons that experience a hard collision in a given event .",
    "a large angle scattering of these two partons produces two ( or more ) final state partons that manifest themselves as hadron large transverse momentum jets . at the same time",
    ", one can not exclude a possibility that more than one pair of partons happen to collide in a given event , giving rise to a multi - jet event .",
    "a possibility of a double hard collision becomes more important with increase of the energy of the collision where scattering off small @xmath8 partons which have much higher densities becomes possible .    in recent years multiparton collisions",
    "have attracted close attention .",
    "following the pioneering work of refs .",
    "@xcite , a large number of related theoretical papers appeared @xcite , based on the parton model and geometrical picture in the impact parameter space .",
    "more recently , this topic has been intensively discussed in view of the lhc program @xcite .",
    "monte carlo event generators that produce multiple parton collisions are being developed @xcite ; theoretical papers exploring properties of double parton distributions and discussing their qcd evolution have appeared @xcite .    in our view , however , important elements of qcd that are necessary for theoretical understanding of the multiple hard interactions issue have not yet been properly taken into account by above - mentioned intuitive approaches .",
    "the problem is , sort of , educational : both the probabilistic picture , the mc generator technology is based upon , and the familiar feynman diagram technique , when used in the momentum space , prove to be inadequate for careful analysis and understanding of the physics of multiple collisions .    from experience gained by treating standard ( single ) hard processes ,",
    "one became used to a motto that a large momentum transfer scale @xmath5 ensures the dominance of small distances , @xmath9 , in a process under consideration . with the multiple collisions under focus",
    ", however , one has to distinguish two space - time scales : that of _ localization _ of the parton participating in a hard interaction , @xmath10 , and that of _ transverse separation _ , @xmath11 , between the two hard collision vertices .",
    "the latter can be large , of the order of the hadron size , even for large @xmath5 .    in order to be able to trace the relative distance between the partons",
    ", one has to use the mixed longitudinal momentum ",
    "impact parameter representation which , in the momentum language , reduces to introduction of a mismatch between the transverse momentum of the parton in the amplitude and that of the same parton in the amplitude conjugated .    another unusual feature of the multiple collision analysis that may look confusing at the first sight is the fact that  even at the tree level  _ the amplitude _ describing the double hard interaction process contains additional integrations over longitudinal momentum components ; more precisely  over the difference of the ( large ) light - cone momentum components of the two partons originating from the same incident hadron ( see section  [ subsec : pt34 ] ) .    in the previous short publication @xcite",
    "we have considered production of two pairs of _ nearly back - to - back _ jets resulting from simultaneous hard collisions of two partons from the wave function of one incident hadron with two partons from the other hadron ( `` four - to - four '' processes ) .",
    "as we have shown , this necessitates introduction of a new object  a generalized double parton distribution , @xmath3gpd , that depends on a new transverse momentum parameter @xmath12 conjugate to the relative distance between the two partons in the hadron wave function .",
    "generalized double parton distributions provide a natural framework for incorporating longitudinal and transverse correlations between partons in the hadron wave function at the @xmath13 scale , and for tracing the perturbative @xmath5-evolution of the correlations .",
    "the corresponding 4-jet cross section can be expressed in terms of @xmath3gpd s as follows [ eq:1 ]    & = & d_a(x_1,x_2 ; ) d_b(x_3,x_4;- ) .",
    "the factor on the second line has dimension of inverse area : = , [ b3 ] where @xmath14 are the corresponding one - parton distributions .",
    "the ratio of the product of two single - inclusive cross sections and the double - inclusive cross section ( @xmath15 ) is often referred to in the literature as `` an effective cross section '' @xmath16 .",
    "we prefer , however , not to look at this quantity as a cross section , since it reflects transversal area of parton overlap as well as longitudinal correlations of the partons . at the same time , it has little to do with the measure of the strength of the interaction , which is what `` cross section '' represents .    in a two - parton collision , scattered partons form two nearly back - to - back jets , while additional jets ( should there be any ) tend to be softer and to align with the directions of initial and final partons , because of collinear enhancements due to radiative nature of secondary partons",
    ". such will be typical characteristics of a _",
    "4-jet event _ , in particular . on the other hand , four jets produced as a result of a _",
    "double hard collision _ of two parton pairs would , on the contrary , form _ two pairs _ of _ nearly back - to - back _ jets .",
    "this kinematical preference is in stark contrast with `` hedgehog - like '' configurations of four jets stemming from a single collision and can be used in order to single out double hard collisions experimentally .",
    "such experimental studies were recently carried out by the cdf and d0 collaborations who have studied production of three jets + photon @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the data performed in @xcite using information about generalized parton distribution ( gpds ) obtained from the study of hard exclusive processes at hera has found that observed @xmath17 rates were a factor @xmath18 higher than the expected rates based on a naive model that neglected correlations between partons in the transverse plane .",
    "the use of @xmath3gpd allows one to incorporate such correlations and predict their @xmath5 evolution .    on the theory side ,",
    "the back - to - back enhancement has been discussed , at tree level , in a number of studies of various channels ( see , for example , discussion of the 2  jets+@xmath19 in @xcite and references therein ) .    in the present paper",
    "we study perturbative radiative effects in the _ differential _",
    "4-jet distribution in the back - to - back kinematics and derive the expression for the corresponding cross section in the leading logarithmic collinear approximation .",
    "it takes into account qcd evolution of the generalized double parton distributions as well as effects due to multiple soft gluon radiation , and turns out to be a direct generalization of the known `` ddt formula '' for back - to - back production of two large transverse momentum particles in hadron collisions @xcite .",
    "we also discuss and treat new specific correlations between transverse momenta of jets due to 3-parton interactions producing 4 jets,``three - to - four '' .",
    "such processes are induced by perturbative splitting of a parton from one of the hadrons , the offspring of which enter double hard collision with two partons from the wave function of the second hadron .",
    "the hard scale of this parton splitting is determined by transverse momentum imbalances of pairs of jets , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and exhibits specific collinear enhancement in the kinematical region where two jet imbalances practically compensate one another , @xmath22 .    consistently taking into account three - to - four parton process",
    "solves a longstanding problem of double counting in treating multi - parton interactions .",
    "discussion of the 2-parton distribution has a long history .",
    "it is commonly defined in the momentum space as a 2-particle inclusive quantity depending on two parton momenta , see @xcite .",
    "being related to ( the imaginary part of ) a certain _ forward _ scattering amplitude , it therefore disregards impact parameter space geometry of the interaction .",
    "exploring properties of 2-parton distributions so defined , an approach to the study of the multiple jet production has been recently suggested in ref .",
    "the reason why this approach has faced difficulties , @xcite , and did not solve , in our view , the problem of systematic pqcd analysis of 4-jet production is clear : it did not incorporate effects due to variations of the transverse separation between the partons  information encoded by @xmath3gpd s but not by the 2-parton momentum distributions .",
    "the @xmath3gpd s were recently used in ref .",
    "@xcite for intuitive description of the total 4-jet production cross section .",
    "however , the differential distributions were not discussed in that paper , and not all relevant pqcd contributions were included , so that our results are different from the ones obtained in @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section [ ptanalysis ] we recall the main ingredients of the perturbative analysis based on selection of maximally collinear enhanced contributions in all orders . in section [ sec : eveq ] we present the evolution equation for generalized two - parton distributions .",
    "section [ sec : pt ] is devoted to the perturbative analysis of small - distance correlations between partons .",
    "the main result of the paper  the differential distribution of 4-jet production in the back - to - back kinematics  is formulated in section  [ sec:4324 ] , and the total cross section of two - dijet production is described in section  [ total ] .",
    "conclusions and outlook are presented in section  [ conclude ] .",
    "the perturbative approach implies that all hardness ( transverse momentum ) scales that characterize the problem are comfortably larger than the intrinsic qcd scale @xmath23 : @xmath24 .",
    "the process under consideration may have up to five hard scales involved .",
    "indeed , in the leading order in @xmath4 , large transverse momentum partons are produced in pairs and have nearly opposite transverse momenta , setting the hard scale @xmath25 . within the parton model framework ( neglecting finite smearing due to intrinsic transverse momenta of incident partons )",
    ", one has @xmath26 .",
    "secondary qcd processes  evolution of initial parton distributions and accompanying soft gluon radiation  introduce transverse momentum imbalance : @xmath27 which constitutes another hard scale : @xmath28 . for production of four jets in the back - to - back kinematics , this gives four different hard scales . as we shall see below",
    ", in the 3-partons collisions producing four jets yet another scale enters the game : @xmath29 with @xmath30  the total transverse momentum of the 4-jet ensemble . in what follows we consider transverse momenta of all four jets to be of the same order , @xmath31",
    "this is not necessary but helps to avoid complications in the hierarchy of relevant scales .",
    "finally , let us mention that in what follows it will be tacitly implied that fixing these scales  from the largest one , @xmath5 , down to smaller ones , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,  is not compromised by uncertainties in determination of the transverse momenta of the jets .",
    "the basic 2-jet production cross section scales , asymptotically , as [ eq:22 ] . according to , production of four jets in simultaneous hard collisions of four partons yields    [ eq:44 ] r^-2()^2 , with @xmath34 the characteristic distance between the two partons in the hadron wave function . at large @xmath5",
    "this cross section is parametrically smaller than that for production of four well separated jets with transverse momenta @xmath35 in a 2-parton collision : [ eq:24 ]    ( with transverse momenta of two out of four jets being integrated over ) .",
    "qualitatively , the production mechanism can be labelled a `` higher twist effect '' .",
    "nevertheless , it may turn out to be essential  comparable with the `` leading twist '' @xmath2 , eq .",
    " if one looks at specific kinematics of the 4-jet ensemble .",
    "let @xmath36 be the direction of colliding hadron momenta .",
    "imagine that we are triggering on two jets moving along the @xmath8 and @xmath37 axes in the transverse plane , and look for two accompanying jets inside some solid angles @xmath38 around the @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions .",
    "the production mechanism does not populate this region : the higher order @xmath2 qcd matrix element is enhanced when two final state partons become _ quasi - collinear _ but is perfectly smooth in the back - to - back kinematics .",
    "therefore , its contribution will be suppressed , @xmath41 contrary to the @xmath1 production mechanism which is concentrated in this very kinematical region .",
    "the differential 4-jet production cross section possesses two collinear enhancements . depending on the kinematics of the jets , they are , symbolically ,    [ eqs:4434 ] [ eq:443444 ] d^(44 ) & & d^2j_3d^2j_4 d , + & & _ 13 ^ 2 q^2 , _ 24 ^ 2 q^2 ; + [ eq:443434 ]",

    "the integrated cross section @xmath45 contains the squared matrix element of the four - parton production and is of the order of @xmath46 , cf .",
    "at the born level , the jets in pairs are exactly back - to - back , so that @xmath47 in .",
    "to have a non - zero value of the transverse momentum imbalance , one has to have additional large transverse momentum parton(s ) produced .    in the second important contribution to the cross section , eq .",
    ", one power of the coupling emerges from the splitting of a parton from one of the incident hadrons into two , and the second power is due to production of an additional final state parton with @xmath48 .    in both cases the smallness due to additional powers of the coupling",
    "is compensated by two broad ( logarithmic ) integrations over transverse momentum imbalances as indicated in .      in the leading order in @xmath4 , it suffices to have just one parton present with @xmath49 in order to assure @xmath50 . at the same time",
    ", inclusive production of accompanying partons with transverse momenta @xmath51 turns out to be _ suppressed _ in a broad interval @xmath52 , as long as one wants to preserve the collinear enhancement factor @xmath53 in the jet correlation .",
    "this dynamical `` veto '' has two consequences .",
    "first of all , it results in _ reduction _ of the hardness scale of the parton distributions from the natural scale @xmath5 ( scale of the parton distributions in the integrated cross section ) down to the observation - induced scale @xmath54 .",
    "then , it introduces double logarithmic ( dl ) form factors of participating initial state partons , since the transverse momentum of the jet pair can be compensated not only by a hard ( energetic ) parton from inside initial parton distributions but also by a _",
    "soft gluon _ whose radiation did not affect inclusive parton distributions due to real  virtual cancellation .    the presence of the dl form factors depending on the logarithm of a large ratio of scales , @xmath55 , is typical for the so - called `` semi - inclusive '' processes  @xcite .",
    "production of massive lepton pairs in hadron collisions ( the drell  yan process ) is a classical example of a two - scale problem . here",
    "enter form factors of colliding quarks that depend on the ratio of the invariant mass @xmath56 to the transverse momentum of the lepton pair , @xmath57 , in the dominant kinematical region @xmath58 : [ eq : ddt2 ] & & = + & & \\",

    "@xmath59 is the double logarithmic qcd quark form factor .",
    "sudakov quark and gluon form factors can be expressed via the exponent of the total probability of the parton decay in the range of virtualities ( transverse momenta ) between the two hard scales :    [ eq : sudakovs ] s_q(q^2,^2 ) & = & \\{- _ ^2^q^2 _ 0 ^ 1-k / q dz p_q^q(z ) } , + s_g(q^2,^2 ) & = & \\{- _ ^2^q^2 _ 0 ^ 1-k / q dz}.    here @xmath60 are the non - regularized one - loop dglap splitting functions ( without the `` + '' prescription ) :    [ eq : splits ]    p_q^q(z ) & = c_f , p_q^g(z ) = p_q^q(1-z ) , p_g^q(z ) & = t_r , p_g^g(z ) = c_a ;    the upper limit of @xmath36-integrals properly regularizes the soft gluon singularity , @xmath61 ( in physical terms , it can be looked upon as a condition that the energy of a gluon should be larger than its transverse momentum , @xcite ) .",
    "the case of hadron interactions producing large transverse momentum _ partons _ ( instead of colorless objects like a drell  yan pair or an intermediate boson ) is more involved since here the transverse momentum imbalance may be compensated by qcd radiation from the _ final state partons _ too .    the azimuthal correlation between two nearly back - to - back large transverse momentum _ particles _ was considered in @xcite .",
    "an analog of the `` ddt formula '' has been derived in the collinear approximation , which expression contained the product of four form factors , two initial parton distributions and two fragmentation functions .",
    "the case when _ jets _ are being reconstructed in the final state is more complicated to analyze as it yields an answer depending on the jet finding algorithm .",
    "the problem has been addressed by banfi and dasgupta in @xcite where a smart way of defining the final state jets was formulated that permitted to write down a resummed qcd formula for soft gluon effects in `` 2 partons @xmath62 2 jets '' cross sections .",
    "collinear logarithms due to hard splittings of the final state partons do not pose a problem : such secondary partons populate the jets .",
    "partons that appear as separate out - of - jet radiation  and are relevant for transverse momentum imbalance compensation  have to be produced at sufficiently large angles with respect to the jet axis .",
    "this is the domain of large - angle gluon radiation .",

    "contrary to _ collinear enhanced effects _",
    "( that drive evolution of parton distributions and fragmentation functions and determine the sudakov form factors ) , the large - angle gluon radiation can not be attributed to one or another of the partons participating in the hard scattering .",
    "it is coherent and depends on the kinematics and color topology of the hard parton ensemble as a whole .",
    "as a result , resummation of these sl corrections becomes a matrix problem that involves tracing various color states of the parton system , see @xcite and references therein .    in the present paper we concentrate on resummation of _ collinear enhanced _ dl and sl terms and",
    "avoid complications due to _ soft _ sl corrections .",
    "this means ignoring color transfer effects in hard interactions .",
    "thus , production of four jets with large transverse momenta @xmath64 and pair imbalances @xmath65 will be equivalent , in our treatment , to production of two colorless drell  yan pairs with invariant masses @xmath66 and transverse momenta @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "generalization of the results of @xcite to the case of double parton scattering seems straightforward and should be considered separately .",
    "the @xmath3gpd in the expression for the multiparton production cross section has a meaning of a two body form factor when partons @xmath67 and @xmath68 receive transverse momenta @xmath69 and @xmath70 leaving the hadron intact",

    "they , however , do not produce collinear enhanced contributions .",
    "effective three - parton interaction vertices are proportional to the linear combination of the transverse momenta of participating partons weighted with the longitudinal light - cone momentum fractions : k_^= _ i k_j^- _ j k_i^. in the matrix element the vector index is contracted with the gluon polarization vector ( for details see @xcite ) .                                reproducing the structure of .",

    "<S> we express differential and total cross sections for two - dijet production in double parton collisions through the generalized two - parton distributions , @xmath3gpds @xcite , that contain large - distance two - parton correlations of non - perturbative origin as well as small - distance correlations due to parton evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these large- and small - distance correlations participate in different manner in 4-jet production , and treat them in the leading logarithmic approximation of pqcd that resums collinear logarithms in all orders .    </S>",
    "<S> a special emphasis is given to @xmath0 double hard interaction processes that occur as an interplay between large- and short - distance parton correlations and were not taken into consideration by approaches inspired by the parton model picture . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the @xmath0 mechanism , being of the same order in @xmath4 as the @xmath1 process , turns out to be _ geometrically enhanced _ compared to the latter and should contribute significantly to 4-jet production .    </S>",
    "<S> the framework developed here takes into systematic consideration perturbative @xmath5 evolution of @xmath3gpds . </S>",
    "<S> it can be used as a basis for future analysis of nlo corrections to multi - parton interactions ( mpi ) at lhc and tevatron colliders , in particular for improving evaluation of qcd backgrounds to new physics searches . </S>"
