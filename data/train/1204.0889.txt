    "in the last decades a lot of attention has been devoted to the role of temperature in quantum information and in quantum mechanics in general .",
    "in particular , the detrimental effects of an environment at finite or even high temperature have been studied in connection with many aspects of quantum mechanics . nevertheless , many studies aimed at singling out robustness of quantum features even in the presence of high temperature , which for instance is the case of thermal entanglement .",
    "recently , the connection between temperature and quantum zeno phenomena has also been explored .",
    "the concept of quantum zeno effect ( qze )  according to its original definition qze consists in the inhibition of the dynamics of a physical system due to repeated pulsed measurements  @xcite , which has been demonstrated in various systems  @xcite  has been progressively generalized .",
    "the first generalization consists in considering continuous measurements meant as dissipative processes  @xcite , showing that a strong decay can be responsible for a dynamical decoupling that weakens the effects of other interactions  @xcite .",
    "another important generalization is related to the knowledge that even an additional coherent coupling can be responsible for diminishing the effects of other interactions , hence realizing the so called zeno dynamics  @xcite and eventually leading to the concept of zeno subspaces  @xcite .",
    "also pulsed interactions have been proven to be responsible for the formation of dynamically invariant subspaces  @xcite .",
    "quantum zeno effect has been exploited to develop applications in various fields , such as quantum information and nanotechnologies  @xcite . moreover , its importance in connection with fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics has been widely discussed  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , zeno phenomena are not confined to the realm of quantum mechanics , but , according to peres , similar occurrences are possible even in classical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the connection between zeno phenomena and temperature has been investigated by various authors . in 2002",
    "ruseckas analyzed the effects of thermalization of a measurement apparatus on the appearance and intensity of the quantum zeno effect , showing that an higher temperature can amplify the power of pulsed measurements in inducing zeno phenomena  @xcite . in 2006",
    "et al _ have studied the crossover between qze and aze  anti - zeno effect is the acceleration of the dynamics induced by measurements , usually incoming for short - but - not - too - short time intervals between subsequent measurements  in connection with the temperature of the bath the system under scrutiny is interacting with , showing that the qze - aze border can be significantly affected by temperature  @xcite .",
    "recently , scala _",
    "et al _ have analyzed landau - zener ( lz ) transitions in the presence of environmental effects , even in the case of a bath at finite or high temperature  @xcite .",
    "the analysis , developed through a master equation approach beyond the secular approximation , has shown that temperature can be responsible for a dynamical decoupling , which eventually leads to a zeno effect . a subsequent study  @xcite developed in connection with a different physical situation  a simplified version of the previous problem , wherein a time - independent hamiltonian has been considered in place of the lz time - dependent coupling scheme",
    " has shown that in some situations temperature can clearly contribute to induce a zeno dynamics , weakening the effects of coherent couplings .",
    "starting from these results , one could wonder whether in those cases wherein temperature can influence more than one interactions it is possible to have temperature - dependent hierarchies of couplings , driving the appearance of zeno behaviors .",
    "indeed , for instance , if two or more interactions are strengthened by temperature , occurrence of zeno phenomena could be obstructed , because of the impossibility of finding a coupling which is much stronger than others ; in other cases temperature can enhance inhibition of the dynamics . in this paper",
    "we analyze the role of temperature when it affects more than one interactions , discussing appearance and disappearance of temperature - induced zeno dynamics , and studying in depth the underlying physical mechanisms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : two_oscillators ] we analyze the dynamics of a three - level system resonantly interacting with two harmonic oscillators initially prepared in a thermal state . in section [ sec : detuning_effects ] we extend the scheme by considering some detuning effects and show an interesting competition between detuning and temperature in determining zeno regimes . in section [ sec : generalization ] we give some preliminary results that pave the way to the analysis of the case where many oscillators are involved in the coupling scheme .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we give some conclusive remarks .",
    "let us consider a three - state system interacting with two harmonic oscillators initially prepared in a thermal state .",
    "the interaction with the oscillators can induce transitions from the upper state to the intermediate one and from the intermediate to the lowest .",
    "both interactions are assumed to be resonant ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : two_osc_res ] ) .    from general statements for the appearance of zeno dynamics  @xcite ,",
    "if the strength of the coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is much greater than the strength of the other coupling , i.e. if @xmath2 , then transitions from @xmath3 to @xmath0  and vice versa  are hindered .",
    "therefore , if the atomic system is initially prepared in the state @xmath3 then the system does not evolve significantly .",
    "we will show that this behavior occurs when temperature is high even if the condition @xmath2 is not fulfilled , provided the frequency of the oscillator assisting @xmath4 transitions is much smaller than the frequency of the oscillator which couples @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "consider the following hamiltonian model ( @xmath5 ) : @xmath6 assuming complete resonance ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , it clearly corresponds to the coupling scheme represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : two_osc_res ] .    )",
    "is resonantly coupled to the intermediate level ( @xmath0 ) , which in turn is resonantly coupled to the lowest level ( @xmath1).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the structure of the hamiltonian is such that the total number of excitations , @xmath9 is a constant of the motion .",
    "therefore the hilbert space is partitioned into invariant three - dimensional subspaces , each spanned by a set @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and each one corresponding to a restriction of the hamiltonian operator which has the following form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the identity of the @xmath15 matrix space . the restricted operator @xmath16 generates the restricted unitary evolution @xmath17 .",
    "we now prove that when @xmath18 the survival probability of the state @xmath10 is preserved .",
    "preliminarily , consider that one of the three eigenenergies associated to @xmath16 is @xmath19  according to the analysis in the appendix [ app : matrix3x3 ] , the matrix in the second line has a vanishing eigenvalue  and that the corresponding eigenstate is @xmath20 with @xmath21^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "now , given a positive number @xmath22 , provided @xmath23 one easily gets that if the initial state is @xmath24 then the population of such initial state is kept close to unity through all the evolution : @xmath25 which can be proven on the basis of the analysis in appendix [ app : matrix3x3 ] .    this result can be thought of as the occurrence of a zeno dynamics , since the @xmath4 coupling hinders the dynamics induced by the @xmath26 interaction .",

    "in fact , for @xmath48 , by choosing @xmath49 , since @xmath50 for very small @xmath22 , one gets @xmath51 .",
    "the limit @xmath52 can be reached in different ways : two possibilities are assuming @xmath53 or assuming @xmath54 . on this basis",
    ", one can assert that in each of the two limits , @xmath55 or @xmath56 , it turns out that @xmath57 for any @xmath30 , provided the temperature is high enough .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in order to achieve the limit in ( [ eq : p1_lower_bound_ii ] ) one must legitimate truncation of the series expansions of the exponentials involved , which is possible under the assumption that the following conditions are fulfilled :    @xmath58    these two inequalities define the limit of high temperature for any fixed value of @xmath22 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolutions_two_osc_res_system ] are shown the evolutions of the survival probability for different temperatures and for different ratios of the frequencies of the two oscillators .",
    "it is evident that the higher the temperature the higher the survival probability at any time .",
    "moreover , the smaller the ratio @xmath59 the higher the asymptotic value of @xmath60 .",
    "it is worth noting the difference with the case analyzed in the previous paper on zeno subspaces induced by temperature  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in that case the limit of the survival probability for @xmath61 is unity , while in the present case the survival probability does not tend toward unity , unless assuming @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) .",
    "this difference can be explained analyzing the physical mechanism on the basis of these zeno - like behaviors induced by temperature .",
    "indeed , the key points are two : first , in each invariant subspace the strength of the coupling with an oscillator grows up as the number of excitations increases ; second , the higher the temperature the more the subspaces with high excitation numbers are populated .",
    "now , in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite the interaction @xmath26 is not assisted by an harmonic oscillator and therefore it is not strengthened by temperature as the interaction @xmath4 is . as a consequence ,",
    "an higher temperature makes the ratio between the two coupling strengths tend toward zero in most of the subspaces . on the contrary , in the present case ,",
    "both couplings , @xmath26 and @xmath4 , are effectively enhanced by temperature , and one needs @xmath64 in order to make the coupling @xmath4 prevail in the majority of the subspaces .",
    "indeed , @xmath65 means that excited states of the oscillator @xmath66 are more populated than the corresponding states of oscillator @xmath67 , at the same temperature .",
    "if this condition ( or the alternative one , i.e. , @xmath68 ) is not properly fulfilled , occurrence of zeno dynamics is attenuated .      in order to better understand the role of temperature",
    ", it could be useful to compare the behaviors of the survival probability at low and high temperature .",
    "in fact , in the zero - temperature case , the only block involved in the dynamics is the one related to @xmath69 , and the inhibition of the dynamics of @xmath70 is determined by the condition @xmath71 , so that it is essentially due to a significant difference between the strengths of the two couplings . on the contrary , when the high - temperature limit is considered , the parameter determining the minimum value of the survival probability is @xmath72 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : definition_eta ] ) , which involves both the coupling strengths and the frequencies of the oscillators .",
    "as already discussed before , a smaller frequency implies an higher degree of population of the excited levels of the oscillator , and eventually a stronger coupling in most of the hilbert space .    on this basis",
    ", one finds that zeno dynamics is possible even in the case @xmath73 , provided @xmath64 and temperature high enough . on the contrary",
    ", temperature can produce the opposite effect , determining disappearance of zeno dynamics .",
    "as an example , consider the case @xmath71 , which implies zeno dynamics at zero temperature , and @xmath74 , which renders @xmath72 large enough to invalidate inhibition of the dynamics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : low_vs_high_temp ] it is shown a case wherein by increasing temperature one lowers the survival probability at any time .     at low and high temperature .",
    "the relevant quantities are @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; temperature : @xmath78 ( red solid line ) , @xmath79 ( black dashed line).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "let us now consider again the hamiltonian in eq.([eq : complete_hamiltonian_model ] ) but without the resonance conditions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : second_system ] ) . generally speaking",
    "the presence of a detuning causes a diminishing of the interaction strength , so that the presence of a detuning in the @xmath4 transition will make us analyze the competition between detuning and temperature in connection with the occurrence of zeno dynamics . on the contrary",
    ", the presence of a detuning in the @xmath26 transition would simply hinder the evolution of the initial atomic state ( @xmath3 ) even in the absence of the second oscillator and relevant coupling .",
    "therefore this analysis would be less interesting .",
    "hence , for the sake of simplicity , let us assume that the transition @xmath26 is resonant with the relevant oscillator ( @xmath80 ) , while the transition @xmath4 is assumed not to be resonant with the second oscillator : @xmath81 .",
    "the restriction of the hamiltonian in the generic invariant subspace corresponding to @xmath82 and @xmath83 is given by the following matrix : @xmath84    ) is resonantly coupled to the intermediate level ( @xmath0 ) , which in turn is non resonantly coupled to the lowest level ( @xmath1).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    according with the analysis in appendix [ app : matrix3x3 ] , in order to have inhibition of the dynamics of the state @xmath85  making it a quasi - eigenstate of the hamiltonian  one needs that @xmath86 is much grater than @xmath87 and greater than @xmath88 .",
    "a large value of detuning can obstacle the appearance of zeno dynamics , but larger values of temperature can establish again such a regime by populating more and more those subspaces wherein @xmath86 is larger ( and even much larger ) than @xmath88 .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : evolutions_detuning ] it is shown the behavior of the population of the atomic state @xmath3 as a function of time but for different values of temperature and detuning . from fig .",
    "[ fig : evolutions_detuning]a we learn that even in the presence of non vanishing detuning there is an increase of the survival probability when temperature becomes higher .",
    "nevertheless , comparing the bold line in this figure with the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolutions_two_osc_res_system]a , we see that the asymptotic value of the population is slightly smaller in the presence of detuning , in spite of the fact that the temperature is the same .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolutions_detuning]b it is shown that , for a fixed value of temperature , a diminishing of the detuning produces an increase of the asymptotic population , as expected .",
    "in view of a possible study of interactions between a few - level system and its environment , the previous analysis could deserve a generalization to the case wherein many harmonic oscillators couple both transitions , @xmath26 and @xmath4 .",
    "since we are interested to the case of quite different bohr frequencies , we can consider two independent sets of oscillators .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian is given by , @xmath89 which conserves the following quantity : @xmath90    therefore the hilbert space is partitioned into invariant subspaces @xmath91 of dimension @xmath92 and spanned by the following vectors : @xmath93 ; @xmath94 with @xmath95 ; @xmath96 , with @xmath95 and @xmath97 .",
    "the restriction of the hamiltonian to each subspace has the following structure :    @xmath98    where the only non vanishing terms in a line or column are between two symbols different from @xmath99 in that line or column . in spite of this fact , the matrix is rather involved and difficult to study .    in the very special case of @xmath100 ,",
    "such structure becomes quite simple : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in the generic subspace",
    "@xmath91 one has @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the matrix in eq .  ( [ eq:1xq_matrix ] ) has the same structure of the matrix analyzed in the appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the basis of that analysis",
    ", we claim that when the system starts form @xmath106 and @xmath107 then the dynamics is hindered .",
    "therefore , focusing our attention on the population of the atomic state @xmath3 irrespectively of the number of excitations of the oscillators , by reasoning as in the previous sections , we can say that the evolution of such population turns out to be hindered when the frequencies @xmath108 are smaller  preferably much smaller  than @xmath109 .",
    "such a condition on the frequencies makes the previous assertion true even if , for example , @xmath110 .",
    "the analysis developed in this paper shows in a clear way the role of the temperature in determining the occurrence of zeno dynamics .    in particular ,",
    "we have considered a few - level system prepared in an excited state and interacting with a set of harmonic oscillators initially prepared in thermal states at the same temperature .",
    "we have pointed out that an higher temperature implies a more significant role of the subspaces of the hilbert space characterized by higher numbers of excitations , which in turn imply stronger effective couplings .",
    "the smaller the frequency of an oscillator the more its excited states are involved in the dynamics , for a given temperature . therefore , the presence of a coupling between the lowest state @xmath1 and the intermediate one @xmath0 can significantly weaken the effects of the @xmath26 coupling , especially when the bohr frequency of the @xmath4 transition is sufficiently small .",
    "this is a significant difference between high - temperature and low - temperature limit , since in the latter case the role of the frequencies is absent and only coupling strengths are important .",
    "this analysis is the prosecution of the study developed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the @xmath26 coupling was induced by an external field assumed not to be affected by temperature . in the present work , instead , we have considered the competition between the growing of both the couplings , @xmath26 and @xmath4 , and the role of temperature and bohr frequencies in making one of them prevail .    a further analysis aimed at considering a set of harmonic oscillators driving each atomic transition  similar to the one performed in the previous paper",
    " would be appropriate .",
    "some preliminary results have been reported in section [ sec : generalization ] .",
    "another point that could deserve attention is the role of possible counter rotating terms in the interaction between the few - level system and the bosonic part of the total system .",
    "the author wishes to thank antonino messina and matteo scala for carefully reading the manuscript .      in this appendix",
    "we prove that a matrix of the following form ( written in the basis @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) : @xmath114 has an eigenvalue whose corresponding eigenstate becomes closer to @xmath111 as the modulus of the coupling constant @xmath115 grows up .",
    "let us first consider the special situation @xmath116 , in which case we can directly check that @xmath117 is an eigenvalue and that the corresponding eigenstate is @xmath118 from which one deduces that @xmath119 tends toward unity in the limit @xmath120 .",
    "now , assume @xmath130 and @xmath120 ( which in turn implies @xmath131 and then @xmath132 ) , one finds that @xmath133\\right| < |\\alpha_1/\\alpha_2|^2\\times|\\delta/(\\delta-\\eta)|^2 < 2|\\alpha_1/\\alpha_2|^2 $ ] .",
    "then , under the previous hypotheses one has @xmath134 .",
    "we conclude reminding that ( see appendix a of ref.@xcite ) if the system is prepared in the initial state @xmath135 , then the survival probability has a non vanishing lower bound : @xmath136 , which of course is close to unity when @xmath137 ."
