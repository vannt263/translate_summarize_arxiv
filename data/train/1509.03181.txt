    "stereoscopic observations , moreover , provide an unprecedented insight into the 3d properties of coronal mass ejections , and allow the determination of cme kinematics without the need to assume constant velocity and strictly radial propagation ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this work we present the analysis of the fast cme that erupted on 03 april 2010 , associated with an interplanetary shock detected by ace on 05 april 2010 .",

    "when deceleration is assumed to take place in the cme propagation , we find @xmath7 , @xmath117 and @xmath9 .",
    "+ although the cme apex was at an angle @xmath135 with respect to the ecliptic plane , an assessment of the error associated to the use of the sssem to determine the shock parameters showed that their values at the cme nose do not substantially differ from those obtained via the sssem .",
