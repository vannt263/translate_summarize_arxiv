    "in 1988 one of us found a preprint by vaughan jones , `` on a certain value of the kauffman polynomial '' @xcite .",
    "we immediately saw that the metaplectic representation for @xmath2 therein had to be related to our chiral potts model work @xcite and it soon became clear that it was even related to the 5-state fateev ",
    "zamolodchikov model @xcite .",
    "after reporting this to vaughan we received an invitation to the workshop on integrable systems in statistical mechanics , quantum field theory , and knot theory , at msri , uc berkeley , january 1989 .",
    "there we both had detailed further discussions on the relationships between knot theory and integrable models of statistical mechanics and some of that got incorporated in the paper `` on knot invariants related to some statistical mechanical models '' @xcite .",
    "one evening during the workshop , vaughan invited us both to his apartment , but helen could not go as our baby was not well . at one point vaughan",
    "came up with five copies of hndel s messiah for five of us present .",
    "he then assigned the four voice parts , `` jacques , do you want to sing tenor or bass?''and anthony wasserman got the piano accompaniment .",
    "thus we performed the entire piece from cover to cover .",
    "it was a deeply spiritual experience with the entire text taken from the king james version of the bible .",
    "we have met vaughan later at several other meetings and have played several games of snooker together . once during a conference honoring baxter in canberra we had a bus trip to tidbinbilla .",
    "vaughan said ,  helen , you have to sit somewhere else ; i have to sit next to jacques . \"  and we sang several parts of the messiah together . even during the great wall expedition of the qinhuangdao conference we sang ` comfort ye ' and",

    "baxter equation @xcite is a generalization of artin s braid equation in knot theory with spectral variables called rapidities @xmath3 , living on oriented lines , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "to each crossing of the rapidity lines one assigns boltzmann weights @xmath4 or @xmath5 depending on a black - white checkerboard coloring assigned to the faces .",
    "most generally , one can have spin variables on all faces , vertices and line pieces , while each spin variable can be chosen independently from a finite or infinite set .",
    "one can sum over the spin @xmath6 at the vertex , obtaining the irf - vertex model with new boltzmann weights @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "such a reduction can always be applied and has been useful in certain spin models , see e.g.  @xcite .    assuming that there are no spins at the intersections of rapidity lines",
    ", one can define several special cases @xcite .",
    "first , if the spins on the line pieces ( @xmath9 ) only take a single value , one can omit them , arriving at the checkerboard interaction - round - a - face ( irf ) model with weights @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "second , assuming all spins on the faces have a single value ( and thus can be omitted ) one receives the checkerboard vertex model with weights @xmath12 , @xmath13 . forgetting about the coloring of the faces one gets the usual vertex model with @xmath14 .",
