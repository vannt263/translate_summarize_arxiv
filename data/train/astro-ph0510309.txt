    "the long bursts ( @xmath2 s ) are known to originate at cosmological distances with many identified counterparts and they are widely believed to be related to the collapse of massive stars @xcite .",
    "considerable information about the short bursts can be found @xcite including the very interesting possibility that the long and short bursts come from the same sources @xcite .",
    "swift results seem to indicate the merger scenario @xcite but further study of short bursts is necessary . in this letter",
    "we discuss the properties of the very short bursts ( @xmath0 ms ; hereafter vsb ) .",
    "we have found some unusual aspects of these events including :    \\a ) very hard photon spectra compared to longer duration grbs .",
    "\\b ) a significant angular asymmetry on the galactic plane .",
    "\\c ) a @xmath3 value consistent with 1/2 .    in this paper",
    "we update the results of @xcite including new events .",
    "we also analyze the vsb observed with the konus detector that have been recently reported @xcite .",
    "sensitivity of konus detector above 1 mev allows to draw firm conclusions on the hard part of the vsb spectra .",
    "data analysis is given in section 2 ( batse results ) and section 3 ( konus results ) , and the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we use the data from the batse current gamma - ray burst catalog @xcite .",
    "it contains the following data base : basic ( 2702 events - last update sep .",
    "9 , 2000 ) , duration ( 2041 events - last update aug.17 , 2000 ) , cmax / cmin ( 1318 events - last update aug . 1 , 2003 ) .",
    "the subsample of short bursts ( hereafter sb ) , with @xmath4 s @xmath5 s , consists of 448 bursts .",
    "there are 51 bursts that have @xmath6 s , and they form our subsample of vsb .",
    "we note that there has been evidence for an anisotropy in the sb from a previous study @xcite .      the angular distribution of vsb and sb in galactic coordinates is shown in fig .",
    "the sky was divided into 8 equal regions . in the case of isotropic distribution",
    "the number of bursts in each region should be described by the poisson distribution .",
    "the histograms of such values are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the probability of any number of bursts in a single zone multiplied by the number of zones ( 8) is shown with full circles . for 448 sb ( @xmath4 s @xmath7 s )",
    "we see conformity with isotropic distribution , but for vsb ( @xmath8 s ) the observed distribution is strongly improbable for isotropic distribution .",
    "the number of bursts in one of the regions ( roughly in the direction of the galactic anticenter ) is 20 , which is much higher than the expected average of 51/8 .",
    "the probability to find twenty or more events ( from the total number of fifty one ) in the region of 1/8 area is 0.00007 .",
    "this result argues for other explanation than the statistical fluctuation .",
    "background in the direction of the galactic center is @xmath9 cts  s@xmath10 , while the mean level of the background outside the region is @xmath11 cts  s@xmath10 , and the total number of sb in this regions is slightly lower than the expected average ( but within the expected error ) .",
    "therefore , background anisotropy can not be responsible for the observed distribution of the vsb across the sky .",
    "we support the choice of @xmath12 = 0.1 s to discriminate vsb from sb with the following consideration . in fig.2",
    "we show the distribution of the excess number of the grbs as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "the excess from the isotropic distribution is calculated as a difference between the grbs number in the chosen region and the sum of all grbs number in other regions divided by seven .",
    "this study shows that the incompatibility with isotropic distribution is seen only for grbs with @xmath8 s. we observe the total excess of @xmath13 bursts in this region .",
    "we have also reanalyzed the overall radial distribution of the vsb and the sb using the standard @xmath3 test @xcite .",
    "we use the cmax / cmin table from batse catalog as an input for @xmath1 calculations : @xmath1 = @xmath14 and we follow the standard algorithm given in @xcite .",
    "eight events in the table cmax / cmin have all values lower than the accepted trigger .",
    "we can either reject these events , or attribute them the value close to the detection threshold ( @xmath15 @xmath16 0.9 ) .",
    "the choice does not affect significantly the measured value of @xmath1 ( see table  [ tab0 ] ) .",
    "the result of @xmath1 distributions and mean values are presented in fig .",
    "3 . sb appear to come from cosmological distances given the @xmath1 distribution we see since this is similar to the distribution for the long grbs .",
    "no cosmological effects are seen in the distribution of vsb .",
    "in table  [ tab1 ] are listed the candidates for vsb from konus - 18 events ! this is approximately what would be expected from the relative konus and batse exposure and confirms that the batse events are real . in the case , when the same event ( the same time of registration ) was observed in both konus and batse experiments both @xmath12 values are shown in table  [ tab1 ] @xcite .",
    "independent detections by satellites other than konus are also marked , including the trigger number ( b - batse , u - ulysses , n - near ) .",
    "we accept as vsb events where no other significant maximum ( above background ) appears within 30 seconds after the trigger .",
    "the konus detector has a significantly larger energy acceptance out to tens of mev .",
    "the batse detector has a smaller nai absorber and is not sensitive to 1 - 10 mev photons .",
    "therefore the konus detector offers the first chance to measure higher energy photons from vsb . however , there are no corresponding coordinates for the konus events as in the case of batse .",
    "we therefore use the konus data mainly for spectral information .",
    "all vsb show appreciable number of photons above 1 mev energy .",
    "this follows the trend observed in the batse data that the vsb events have a hard energy spectrum .",
    "all events also show gamma rays above 5 mev . in fig.4",
    "we compare the mean energy of sb and vsb for konus events .",
    "we observe that in the mev region the spectra of vsb are significantly harder than the spectra of sb .",
    "the spectra start to be flatter above 3 mev and the effect in the case of vsb is again stronger .",
    "this extended analysis of the batse data and the results of the konus detector continue to suggest that the vsb events form a separate class of events from the sb .",
    "strong anisotropy and @xmath17 consistent with euclidean space strongly argue for the local origin of this phenomenon .",
    "spectra of vsb are very hard , supporting the claim that a different mechanism is here at work .    detected counterparts of long bursts at other wavelengths established the relation of those events to the massive star collapse ; no such support was available for sbs @xcite .",
    "therefore , several possibilities for the origin of this class of bursts were proposed , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this includes neutron star mergers @xcite and neutron star collapse to strange - quark stars @xcite .",
    "there were also suggestions that the nature of long and short bursts is the same @xcite although sb are on average harder @xcite , have @xmath18 closer to 1 and show traces of anisotropy @xcite .",
    "vsbs are extreme examples being still harder and showing even more spectacular anisotropy , clearly indicating towards the local origin of this class of events .",
    "primordial black hole evaporation , as an explanation of the existence of the vsb class , is also possible ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the energy expected from such phenomenon is of order of @xmath19 , and the currently evaporating black holes have masses @xmath20 g @xcite",
    ". such energy , if converted with an efficiency @xmath21 into the form of @xmath22-rays collimated in a solid angle @xmath23 , would give the observed fluence @xmath24}$ ] .",
    "the weakest vsb ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) can come from distances of @xmath25 pc if uncollimated , and from further out if some collimation is involved .",
    "however , less standard approach to primordial black hole mass evaporation gives much broader range of numbers @xcite .",
    "we also note that there is some confusion between the short grb and the sgr super flares @xcite",
    ". however , the very hard spectrum of the vsb would seem to separate those types of events .",
    "plausible detection of x - ray afterglows @xcite , and recent claims of the identification of a host galaxy for two sb swift bursts @xcite might point toward merger scenario .",
    "one of the localized bursts ( grb  050724 ) is a typical sb ( @xmath26 s ) .",
    "the other one ( grb  050509b ) is intermediate between a vsb and a sb .",
    "its galactic coordinate is not in the excess region of fig 1a and the limited energy acceptance of swift does not allow a test of the presence of mev photons to compare with other vsb studied here .",
    "more swift data may clear the issue .",
    "in this paper we have provided a new analysis of the most recent vsb events from batse .",
    "we have also studied the vsb from konus for the first time .",
    "we show that the grbs with time duration below 100 ms appear to form a separate class of grbs .",
    "the konus data show that these events have a very hard photon spectrum up to 10 mev - this effect was already hinted in the batse hardness data .",
    "the events appear to originate nearby within the galaxy as the asymmetry plot ( fig .",
    "1.a ) and the @xmath1 distribution ( fig .",
    "2.a ) indicate .",
    "this effect is statistically significant . in previous studies of this subject ,",
    "we have suggested that such events could come from primordial black hole evaporation @xcite , with supplementary details in @xcite .",
    "the other local sources such as neutron stars should also be candidates .",
