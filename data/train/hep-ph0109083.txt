    "<S> \\label{eq : i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we treat the soft susy - breaking parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 as free ones since the ratios @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are highly model - dependent . by diagonalizing the matrix ( [ eq : f ] ) one gets the mass eigenstate @xmath18 . + we take @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the su(2 ) , u(1 ) gaugino and gluino mass , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath24 as @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> full expressions of the widths of the squark decays are given in @xcite .    in case @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> are relatively large in eqs.([eq : f]-[eq : i ] ) , for @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) we have @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , which may allow the bosonic decays of eq.([eq : bmodes ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two patterns of the squark mass spectrum : @xmath28 with ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) @xmath30 ( @xmath31,@xmath32 ) for @xmath33 , and @xmath29 with ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) @xmath30 ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the bosonic decays considered here are basically the decays of @xmath31 into @xmath32 and @xmath35 into @xmath34 .    </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : gh+ ] the higgs bosons @xmath37 couple mainly to @xmath38 combinations . </S>",
    "<S> these couplings are proportional to the yukawa couplings @xmath39 and the squark mixing parameters @xmath14 and @xmath40 ( eq.([eq : gh+ ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence the widths of the squark decays into @xmath37 may be large for large @xmath14 and @xmath40 . in contrast , the gauge bosons @xmath41 couple only to @xmath42 , which results in suppression of the decays into @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this suppression is largely compensated by a large extra factor steming from the contribution of the longitudinally polarized w boson radiation ( @xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence the widths of the squark decays into @xmath41 may be large for a sizable @xmath44 mixing term @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the fermionic decays are not enhanced for large @xmath14 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the branching ratios of the bosonic decays of eq.([eq : bmodes ] ) are expected to be large for large @xmath14 and @xmath40 if the gluino mode is kinematically forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> the widths of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays into @xmath37 receive very large susy - qcd corrections for large @xmath46 in the on - shell ( os ) renormalization scheme @xcite , making the perturbative calculation unreliable . </S>",
    "<S> this problem can be solved by carefully defining the relevant tree - level couplings in terms of appropriate running parameters and on - shell squark mixing angles @xmath47 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following ref.@xcite , we calculate the tree - level widths of the squark decays by using the corresponding tree - level couplings defined in terms of the susy - qcd running parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( with q = ( on - shell mass of the decaying squark @xmath50 ) ) , and the on - shell squark mixing angles @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> we call the widths thus obtained as renormalization group ( rg ) improved tree - level widths. our input parameters are all on - shell ones except @xmath51 which is a running one , i.e. they are @xmath52 , and m. @xmath53 is the on - shell @xmath54 for the @xmath55 sector . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure for getting all necessary on - shell and susy - qcd running parameters is given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the calculation of the standard model running quark mass @xmath56 from the two - loop rg equations we use the two - loop running @xmath57 as in @xcite . we take @xmath58=175gev and @xmath59=5gev . </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath60 = @xmath61 = @xmath62 ( @xmath60 = @xmath63 = @xmath64 ) for @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) decays , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 decay , for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we fix m=400gev ( i.e. @xmath23=1065gev ) and @xmath25=150gev . </S>",

    "<S> we show also those of the corresponding branching ratio @xmath70 at the naive ( unimproved ) tree - level , where all input parameters are bare ones ( see eqs.([eq : f]-[eq : i ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the @xmath3 decays into bosons are dominant in a large region of the a-@xmath40 plane , especially for large @xmath72 and/or @xmath73 , as we expected . comparing fig.1.c with fig.1.d we find that the effect of running of the quark and squark parameters @xmath74 is quite dramatic </S>",
    "<S> . for @xmath4 decays we have obtained similar results to those for the @xmath3 decays @xcite .    in fig.3 of ref . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the branching ratios of the @xmath3 decays into bosons increase with increasing @xmath46 and become dominant for large @xmath46 @xmath76 , while the @xmath4 decays into bosons are dominant in the entire range of @xmath46 shown , as expected @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dominance of the bosonic modes is fairly insensitive to the choice of the values of @xmath25 , m , and the ratio @xmath77 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays into higgs or gauge bosons can be dominant in a fairly wide mssm parameter region with large mass difference between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , large @xmath78 and/or @xmath73 , and large @xmath23 ( and large @xmath46 for the @xmath3 decay ) . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the conventional fermionic decays these bosonic decays can have significantly different decay distributions @xcite . </S>",
