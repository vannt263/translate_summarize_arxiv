    "gauge theories of gravitation are an attempt to describe such interaction using techniques well established in the description of the other fundamental interactions .",
    "moreover , the study of symmetries and conservation laws in physical space is a powerful tool for understanding the fundamentals of mechanics .",
    "the idea of extrapolating and using the same kind of apparatus in an internal space opens a window of possibilities ; this was exactly what allowed us to understand the real essence of the `` charge '' : quantities conserved under the action of a particular group of symmetry in internal space @xcite .",
    "the existence of an internal space , in turn , is associated with extra degrees of freedom which are evident in the hamiltonian formulation of the theory .",
    "these theories are said to be constrained , since its phase space has decreased @xcite .",
    "although in the study of constrained hamiltonian systems the appearance of extra degrees of freedom ( internal space ) is a consequence of the size of the configuration space , without any physical notion of real essence of this space , we know they are degrees of freedom associated with the source field ; a consequence of the invariance of the total lagrangian under transformations in this field .    the equivalence principle states that the equations of special relativity must be recovered in a locally inertial coordinate system in which gravitational effects are absent .",
    "thus , based on this principle , it would be natural to expect that gravitation had a local poincar symmetry , and it was possible to describe it as a genuine gauge theory for this group .",
    "in fact , this is possible @xcite .",
    "however there are evidences , both theoretical and experimental / observational , that from the most fundamental point of view ( beyond the standard model ) the lorentz symmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "this would eliminate the poincar group as local symmetry group of gravity , leaving room only for the translational sector or another more general .",
    "the tegr is a particular case of a more general theory that has a set of three free parameters , the teleparallel gravity , which is fully equivalent to general relativity @xcite . in order of better understanding its internal structure ,",
    "one should apply the tools mentioned in the paragraphs above . as will be seen ,",
    "we show that starting from the tegr lagrangian presented in the literature , we conclude that the internal space associated with the tegr seems to be invariant under the action of a group which generalizes the poincar group .",
    "notation : the greek alphabet is used to represent physical space indices ( @xmath0 , ... = 0,1,2,3 ) , the first half of the latin alphabet @xmath1 represents indices of the internal space , or gauge , and the second half of the latin alphabet @xmath2 assumes the values of 1 , 2 and 3 of the physical space .",
    "the lagrangian density associated with tegr has the form .",
    "the object @xmath3 is the weitzenbock connection defined by @xmath4 . ]",
    "@xcite : @xmath5 \\ ; \\label{1}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this expression can be rewritten in a more elegant form to get @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 \\label{3}\\ ] ] and @xmath10 is the contortion tensor given by @xmath11    the procedure of a legendre transformation from the previous lagrangian density is not sufficient to get its hamiltonian version , since it is not possible to isolate all the terms of velocities depending on the momenta @xcite . to circumvent this problem , we should simplify this lagrangian density , making it linear before proceeding @xcite ; this `` linearization '' is done by introducing auxiliary fields @xmath12 that will be related to the torsion tensor .",
    "the first order differential lagrangian formulation in empty physical space reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 and @xmath17 . after a long development , the first class secondary constraints",
    "are found @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 furthermore , the objects were defined : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 \\label{12}\\ ] ] and @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the momenta canonically conjugated to @xmath26 .",
    "being the constraints first class we can use them to calculate the transformations generated by the constraints , which do not alter the physical state of the system ( gauge transformations ) @xcite : @xmath27 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int d^{3}x ' \\varepsilon_{1}^{a}(x ' ) \\left(\\frac{\\delta h^{b}{}_{\\rho}(x)}{\\delta h^{c}{}_{\\beta}(x ' ) } \\frac{\\delta \\phi_{a}(x)}{\\delta \\pi_{c}{}^{\\beta}(x')}-\\frac{\\delta h^{b}{}_{\\rho}(x)}{\\delta \\pi_{c}{}^{\\beta}(x ' ) } \\frac{\\delta \\phi_{a}(x)}{\\delta h^{c}{}_{\\beta}(x ' ) } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\int d^{3}x ' \\varepsilon_{2}^{a}(x ' ) \\left(\\frac{\\delta h^{b}{}_{\\rho}(x)}{\\delta h^{c}{}_{\\beta}(x ' ) } \\frac{\\delta \\chi_{a}(x)}{\\delta \\pi_{c}{}^{\\beta}(x')}-\\frac{\\delta h^{b}{}_{\\rho}(x)}{\\delta \\pi_{c}{}^{\\beta}(x ' ) } \\frac{\\delta \\chi_{a}(x)}{\\delta h^{c}{}_{\\beta}(x ' ) } \\right ) , \\label{14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that results in @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 playing the role of covariant derivative and connection , respectively .",
    "we can go ahead and rewrite ( [ 15 ] ) as follows : @xmath31 introducing now the following relation between the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 we have : @xmath35 the subindex 2 can now be ignored , @xmath36 the above transformations allow a direct analogy with the gauge transformations obtained in the yang - mills theory .",
    "the transformations ( [ 21 ] ) enable a fundamental analysis to understand the kinematics of the internal space ( gauge symmetry group ) .",
    "we have @xmath37 and motivated by the soldering property @xcite , we can decompose @xmath38 as follows @xmath39 even if there is no gauge potential ( gravity ) , the trivial part @xmath40 remains `` linking '' the physical and internal spaces .",
    "although we have no idea of what would represent other potentials , besides the already well known @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we have kept open the possibility that they exist .",
    "armed with this decomposition , it is possible to write @xmath43 or , using ( [ 22 ] ) @xmath44 from this point it is possible , by integrating in @xmath45 , to get the following expression for the internal space transformations : @xmath46 with @xmath47 or , rearranging terms : @xmath48 here @xmath49 , and the negative sign of @xmath50 was absorbed by @xmath51 . in this case , assuming that the last integral in ( [ 27 ] ) results in the usual lorentz transformations , we clearly have a generalization of the poincar transformations @xmath52 however , this generalization only exists for cases in which we include potentials beyond the usual @xmath41 and @xmath53 , which would imply the existence of other degrees of freedom associated with these potentials . for the case",
    "where the last integral in ( [ 27 ] ) does not result in the lorentz transformations , we have a generalization even if we have not included other potential .",
    "in addition , the transformations ( [ 28 ] ) may vary both in form and scale , the first two integrals in ( [ 27 ] ) depend of @xmath54 , and therefore have different results for each of the possible indexes for this parameter , internal or physical .    from the expressions ( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) it can be noted that for the case in which @xmath38 is decomposed only as @xmath55 , all the `` rotation '' matrices @xmath50 are zero , hence : @xmath56 which is exactly a translation in the internal space .",
    "this is in total agreement with the literature of gauge theories to the translation group @xcite , in which the fundamental object is the potential @xmath41 .",
    "regardless of what values are calculated in the integrations ( [ 27 ] ) , it seems reasonable to think that their results will take the form ( [ 28 ] ) , since through it we can get both poincar as translations , depending on how we make the decomposition of the tetrad field components @xmath38 .",
    "from the viewpoint of gauge theories , the gauge fields `` appear '' as compensating fields , that guarantee the invariance of the lagrangian under the action of a transformation group acting on the source field ( first kind gauge transformations ) @xcite . thinking this way , the analysis of a lagrangian without sources - anywhere - is merely an academic exercise , not having much physical support ; the only way to `` generate '' the gauge field is through the action of the symmetry group of the internal space ( variation of the source field ) . for the case of gravitation , however , the previous statement is not necessarily true , since the free lagrangian leads to the field equations that contain a term of `` vacuum source '' : in other words , gravitation is nonlinear .",
    "when trying to do a mental exercise and view the generation of gauge fields in the case of gravitation , we face the following problem .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary source of gravity defined in an internal space .",
    "acting with the symmetry group of this space there emerges a distortion in a compensatory way ( tension , making an analogy with a fabric ) in physical space , which manifests itself through the gravitational field .",
    "this gravitational field , in turn , having a not null energy should also generate an additional distortion in space ( second order effect ) , but , being defined in physical space , how could it restart the cycle ?",
    "it is necessary that the gravitational field interferes locally in the internal space for it generates , in turn , a new perturbation in the physical space ( second order field ) , and this process repeats itself indefinitely .",
    "the figure 1 illustrates some of what was said .     and @xmath57 , representing the field strength generated by the acting of the groups @xmath58 and @xmath59 . ]    observing the first and second kind gauge transformations it is possible to infer how the process occurs .",
    "we have , after a gauge transformation in the internal space ,    @xmath60    and consequently the physical space responds with the emergence of @xmath38 .",
    "this , in turn , varies with @xmath61 according to @xmath62 the connection @xmath63 can be divided into two parts ; the first one leads algebra indices into algebra indices again , as in the yang - mills theory .",
    "the second , in turn , leads algebra indices into physical space indices : @xmath64\\varepsilon^{a } , \\label{33}\\ ] ] or , @xmath65 .",
    "\\label{34}\\ ] ] the first part is analogous to the yang - mills connection .",
    "the second part , however , allows that @xmath66 , now with physical space index , calibrates objects defined in this space .",
    "note that this is not only a consequence of the locality of gauge transformations ; the effect of the first kind transformations is just `` to force '' the emergence of the field .",
    "however , it does not ensure that this field generates new transformations ; these arise as consequence of the parameters @xmath67 having the possibility to be written as being @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , as already mentioned , the form of transformations ( [ 31 ] ) is not fixed , it varies with @xmath69 ; the first two integrals in ( [ 27 ] ) depend on @xmath66 , and therefore they have different results for each of the possible indices for this parameter , internal or physical .",
    "another key issue is that for the case of gauge theories such as electromagnetism , for example , the first kind transformations are represented by the action of the symmetry group in a given source field . for the case of gravitation , however , the action of the group takes place directly on the base that defines the internal space @xmath70 , not on a source field defined in this space .",
    "this allows us to conjecture that the source of gravity must be associated to the existence of internal space itself , and not to the sources defined therein , as with other interactions .",
    "the equivalence principle , or equivalently the universality of free fall , leaves a tiny gap to the issue of symmetry of internal space . in fact , being the gravitation universal , its symmetry group of the internal space should act on any field that has non - zero energy , thus ensuring its coupling to this field .",
    "however , the very usual concept of gauge symmetry rejects this idea , i.e. the gauge group acts only on fields with specific properties . ] and therefore defined in a special space , called internal space . one way to circumvent this issue",
    "is to assume that the internal space of gravity is the very physical space in a `` local scale '' , in such way that thinking in a symmetry group for this space is now the same as thinking in a kinematics to the physical space .",
    "this kinematics is given by the set of transformations ( [ 28 ] ) , which can generalize the usual transformations of special relativity .",
    "for obvious reasons , this alternative is valid only if the gravitation is in fact universal .",
    "the figure 2 illustrates how would be the fiber bundle of the fundamental interactions in the scenario described throughout this section .",
    "note that the scenario above is quite different from a mere extrapolation of gravity for the context of gauge theories .",
    "such extrapolation would imply a scenario as illustrated by the figure 3 .",
    "however , as we have seen , there are sufficient reasons to disregard this second scenario .",
    "through the second kind gauge transformations , it was possible to get the most fundamental transformations , i.e. , the first kind ones .",
    "we show that with the possibility of decomposing the tetrad field components as a trivial part plus some potential besides the usual lorentz and translational potentials , there is still the possibility that the symmetry group of the internal space be a generalization of the poincar group . still in the analysis of transformations in the internal space",
    ", we saw that for the case in which the decomposition of the tetrad field components mentioned above includes only a trivial part plus the translational potential , we recover the group of translations .",
    "this is in complete agreement with the literature .",
    "the _ spin _ connection present in ( [ 32 ] ) , and rewritten in ( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 34 ] ) , allows that internal space indices be taken as physical space indices , i.e. , the parameters of gauge transformation can also be defined on the base manifold .",
    "this unique peculiarity of gravitation makes impossible that the parameters defined in ( [ 27 ] ) be interpreted as phases of wave functions defined in internal space , being this peculiarity related to universality of gravitation , i.e. , the universality allows that objects be defined both in physical space or in the internal space . in short ,",
    "given a source field @xmath71 , can be associated with the gravitational field itself .",
    "however , as already said , it does not mean that there are other sources . ]",
    "@xmath72 can be any @xmath73 , with @xmath74 given by ( [ 22 ] ) . when choosing a specific calibration , through the introduction of new second class constraints , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are also specified , i.e. all degrees of freedom have now been transferred to the physical space .",
    "this specification , however , was not made at the expense of choosing a particular phase of a wave function defined in internal space , but choosing parameters , even without a precise physical interpretation , which can be defined in both spaces .",
    "is also worth mentioning that being gravitation universal , its internal space must be the actual physical space ( local scale ) , and therefore its symmetry group of internal space is the kinematical group of physical space itself .",
    "this group was obtained , and is represented by the set of transformations ( [ 28 ] ) .          from the astrophysicist viewpoint",
    "a singularity occurs when a gravitational energy source is confined to a sufficiently small region of space . from a more fundamental point of view , singularities like schwarzschild @xmath75 exist independently of the value of the mass , being necessary only that the mass be contained in a region smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "the `` non - compactness '' allows the internal space to be `` bigger '' than the very physical space ( in a local scale ) , thus , by making a first kind gauge transformation it is possible that the physical space , being locally attached to the internal space , has its structure `` stretched '' beyond the supportable . as a result , the fabric of the physical space would be `` ripped '' thus creating a singularity .",
    "the figure 4 illustrates what was said .",
    "a complete analysis of this issue will be made elsewhere .",
