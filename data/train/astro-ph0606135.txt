    "the zz ceti stars are pulsating white dwarfs whose optical spectra are dominated by hydrogen lines ( da stars ) .",
    "they are found in a very well defined region in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane , known as the zz ceti instability strip .",
    "they exhibit pulsation periods in the range 100 - 1400 s , corresponding to low degree gravity - mode oscillations .",
    "the detected pulsation modes have amplitudes that are found in the range from a few millimagnitudes in the low - amplitude pulsators to a fraction of a magnitude in the largest amplitude ones .",
    "the zz ceti stars show some remarkable trends , although there are a few exceptions .",
    "for instance , the cooler pulsators tend to show longer periods and larger amplitudes . also , for a given effective temperature",
    ", the observed periods tend to be longer for lower gravity objects .    since the early 90 s",
    ", our group in montral has been carrying out a systematic study aimed at defining the empirical boundaries of the zz ceti instability strip .",
    "we use quantitative time - averaged optical spectroscopy to pin down the locations of candidate stars in the @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram , and we follow up on these candidates with `` white light '' fast photometry to determine if a target pulsates or not .",
    "the determination of these boundaries is essential if we are to understand better the zz ceti phenomenon and to establish on a more quantitative footing the trends already alluded to above .",
    "the question of the purity of the instability strip ( i.e. , the absence of photometrically constant stars within ) is also an important issue , and this for several reasons .",
    "first , a pure strip implies that the zz ceti phenomenon is an evolutionary phase through which all da white dwarfs must pass .",
    "it is then possible to apply what is gleaned from asteroseismological studies of these stars , such as information on their internal structure , to the entire class of da white dwarfs .",
    "second , knowing that the strip is pure allows us to predict the variability of a star simply through a measure of its atmospheric parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the paper of @xcite presented , for the first time , a complete and homogeneous picture of the zz ceti stars in terms of their time - averaged properties .",
    "it was based on the sample of 22 pulsators known at the time . in the meantime",
    ", we pursued our survey to improve statistics , and we reported several discoveries and new findings in a series of papers , the last of which is @xcite where references to our previous work can be found .",
    "one of the key results of @xcite , based on our homogeneous spectroscopic sample of 39 pulsators and 121 constant stars , is the demonstration that the zz ceti strip is indeed pure .",
    "furthermore , that paper incorporated the first results of an extended ongoing survey whose primary aim is to define more accurately the empirical boundaries of the instability strip .",
    "that survey is based on spectroscopic measurements of a subsample of da white dwarfs from the catalog of spectroscopically identified white dwarfs of @xcite .",
    "we thus obtain optical spectra for each star and then fit the balmer line profiles using a grid of synthetic spectra generated from detailed model atmospheres .",
    "this allows us to accurately measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 for each star .",
    "it is then possible to identify white dwarfs whose atmospheric parameters place them near or within the zz ceti instability strip . in this paper",
    ", we report on the latest results of this ongoing survey after the 2005 - 2006 observing season .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the vast majority of the new pulsators , however , are significantly fainter than those previously known and , therefore , have a much less interesting asteroseismological potential . moreover , the relatively low s /",
    "n ratio spectroscopic observations reached in the sdss limits the usefulness of statistical studies based on them .",
    "of particular interest here , @xcite claimed that the zz ceti instability strip contains several nonvariable stars on the basis of the sdss sample of @xcite .",
    "we conclusively showed in @xcite , however , that this incorrect result could be explained in terms of insufficient s / n ratio in the sdss spectra .",
    "thus , we believe that improvements in our empirical description of the zz ceti instability strip necessarily rests on high s / n ( @xmath4 80 ) time - averaged spectroscopy such as in the survey we are currently pursuing .",
    "this limits the potential targets to relatively bright stars ( @xmath5 ) , but as we are finding out as well as others ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are still bright zz ceti pulsators to be discovered .",
    "we proceeded to secure high - speed photometric measurements for those newly analyzed stars in our spectroscopic survey whose atmospheric parameters would place them inside or near the edges ( blue and red ) of the known zz ceti instability domain .",
    "these follow - up observations were secured over the course of 3 observing runs in 2005 and 2006 . in all , 6 of these stars turned out to be genuine pulsating da white dwarfs : zz ceti stars .",
    "a summary of our observations is presented in table 1 .",
    "mct 2148@xmath22911 was observed on 2005 august 13 with the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope equipped with lapoune , the portable montral three - channel photometer .",

    ", we provide the data for the white dwarfs we found to be photometrically constant .",
    "in addition to the apparent magnitude , we also indicate the limit to which no photometric variations were detected ( in the 20 - 2000 s period range ) .",

    "it is necessary to set the exposure time long enough to cover several pulsation cycles .",
    "however , not knowing a priori that the stars listed in table 2 would turn out to be variable , this criterion was not met for the three longer period variables .",
    "it will therefore be necessary to acquire new optical spectra for these stars in order to refine our determination of their atmospheric parameters .",
    "consequently , the atmospheric parameters for these objects are considered preliminary and as such , they are marked with a colon in table 4 .",
    "nonetheless , these results demonstrate once again the ability of the spectroscopic method , pioneered by @xcite , at predicting the variability of da white dwarfs .",

    "note that three low - gravity objects , shown by filled squares in figure [ zzstrip ] , represent unresolved double degenerate systems and that the atmospheric parameters are the average values of both components of the system ; the red square is gd 429 ( wd  0416 + 701 ) identified as a velocity variable by @xcite .",
    "hence these can not be used to constrain the slope of the blue edge , as discussed by @xcite . furthermore , since the atmospheric parameters for the new long period variables are preliminary , we have refrained from redefining the empirical red edge , and we have simply reproduced in figure [ zzstrip ] the value obtained by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that additional observations are required to pin down the final empirical boundaries , in particular near the blue edge of the strip .",
    "hopefully we will report such observations in the near future when our survey is completed .",
    "we note that the periods of the dominant oscillation modes in the first three stars of table 2 , as well as those of the last three objects , are consistent with the positions of these stars inside or near the blue ( short - period pulsators ) and red ( long - period pulsators ) edges of the instability strip , respectively .",
    "however , as a curiosity , we also point out that the amplitudes of the detected modes in the three `` red edge '' pulsators are not very large , especially for gd 1212 .",
    "this goes against the general tendency to observe large amplitudes in the cooler objects .",
    "note also the very long period seen in kuv 03442 + 0719 , one of the longest if not the longest one ever detected in a zz ceti star .",
    "are we observing stars at the very red edge of the strip , basically `` dying off '' in amplitude ?",

    "the amplitude modulation due to destructive interference between the different pulsation modes is also very evident . from this light curve , we computed the fourier ( amplitude ) spectrum shown in the top panel of figure [ fft_g232 ] .",
    "the dominant pulsation period obtained from the fourier spectrum is 870.4 s. the light curve and associated fourier spectrum are , in fact , quite reminiscent of those found in another cool large amplitude zz ceti star , gd 154 @xcite whose fourier spectrum is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fft_g232 ] .",
    "the fourier spectrum of gd 154 was calculated from a nearly 6-hour long light curve which we obtained on the night of 1991 may 22 with lapoune attached to the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "it is likely , as in gd 154 , that the main peak in the fourier spectrum of g232 - 38 contains a few closely spaced modes in frequency , and that the other peaks are simply nonlinear structures caused by harmonics and cross - frequencies of the main modes .",
