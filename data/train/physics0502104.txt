    "this work further develops the @xmath0 approximation suggested in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it also presents the details of the calculations of the energy levels of ge  ii , sn  ii and pb  ii @xcite which were needed to study their dependence on the fine structure constant @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "some lines of ge  ii , sn  ii and pb  ii have been observed in quasar absorption spectra and the information on the dependence of corresponding frequencies on @xmath2 is needed to study possible variation of the fine structure constant at early epoch .    in the vicinity of the physical value of @xmath2 the frequency of an atomic transition",
    "can be presented in a form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the present - day laboratory values of the fine structure constant and transition frequency .",
    "the values of the @xmath8-coefficients can only be found from atomic calculations by , e.g. , varying the value of @xmath2 in computer codes based on relativistic equations . in many cases calculated values of the @xmath8-coefficients are more stable than the energies .",
    "this is because they are not sensitive to incompleteness of the basis set with respect to the principal quantum number @xmath9 . indeed , relativistic corrections are proportional to @xmath10 @xcite ( @xmath11 is the effective principal quantum number ) while energies are proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "if we include more states of high @xmath11 this would have greater effect on the energies than on relativistic corrections presented by @xmath8-coefficients .",
    "however , in the case of strong configuration mixing and level pseudo - crossing calculation of @xmath8-coefficients may become very unstable @xcite . in the vicinity of level",
    "pseudo - crossing the values of @xmath8-coefficients change very rapidly with @xmath2 and small error in determining the position of the level crossing may lead to large error in the values of @xmath8 .",
    "level pseudo - crossing always means strong configuration mixing between the states .",
    "however , strong configuration mixing may also take place without level pseudo - crossing .",
    "this can also cause instability in calculated values of @xmath8-coefficients .",
    "indeed , relativistic correction to the energy of a single electron state @xmath13 strongly depends on the total momentum @xmath14 of this state ( see , e.g. formula  ( 7 ) in ref .",
    "therefore configurations composed from states of different @xmath14 may have very different values of @xmath8 and small error in the the configuration mixing coefficients would lead to large error in the resulting @xmath8 value for the mixed state  @xcite .    strong configuration mixing and level pseudo - crossing take place for ge  ii , sn  ii and pb  ii ions @xcite as well as for many other atoms and ions @xcite .",
    "this means that calculations need to be done to very high accuracy to ensure stable values of the @xmath8-coefficients .",
    "the criterion is that deviation of the calculated energies from the experimental values must be much smaller than the experimental energy interval between mixed states .",
    "there are many other areas of research where accurate atomic calculations are needed .",
    "these include parity and time invariance violation in atoms ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , atomic clocks @xcite , interaction of positrons with atoms  @xcite , etc .",
    "a way to do accurate calculations for atoms with several @xmath15 and/or @xmath16 valence electrons has been suggested in ref .",
    "it is called `` the @xmath0 approximation '' , where @xmath17 is the hartree - fock potential created by @xmath18 electrons of the closed shell ion , @xmath19 is total number of electrons in neutral atom and @xmath20 is the number of valence electrons .",
    "initial hartree - fock calculations are done for a closed - shell positive ion with all valence electrons removed .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the hartree - fock potential of the closed - shell positive ion is often a good starting approximation for a neutral atom .",
    "this is the case when valence electrons are localized on distances larger than the size of the core",
    ". then they can affect only energies of core states but not their wave functions . since the potential created by core electrons depends on the electron charge density and",
    "does not depend on electron energies it does nt matter which core states are used to calculate the potential - states of the neutral atom or states of the closed - shell positive ion .    the effective hamiltonian for valence electrons is constructed using the configuration interaction ( ci ) technique .",
    "core - valence correlations are included by adding the electron correlation operator @xmath21 to the ci hamiltonian .",
    "many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) is used to calculate @xmath21 .",
    "the main advantage of the @xmath0 approximation is that mbpt is relatively simple ( no subtraction diagrams ) and the @xmath21 operator can be calculated beyond the second - order of the mbpt .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that inclusion of the higher - order core valence correlations lead to further significant improvement of the accuracy of calculations .    in the previous work  @xcite the @xmath0 approximation was used for kr and ba while higher - order core - valence correlations were included for ba and ba@xmath22 only . in the present work we study twelve",
    "complicated many - electron systems including germanium , tin , lead and their positive ions .",
    "we demonstrate that using the @xmath23 approximation ( @xmath1 for the case of ge , sn and pb ) and accurate treatment of the core - valence correlations lead to high accuracy of calculations for all twelve systems .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath0 approximation is a good approximation for a wide range of atoms and ions .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for valence electrons in the @xmath0 approximation has the form @xmath24 @xmath25 is the one - electron part of the hamiltonian @xmath26 @xmath27 is the correlation potential operator which is exactly the same in the @xmath0 approximation as for the single - valence electron atoms ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it can be calculated in the second - order of the mbpt . selected chains of the higher - order diagrams",
    "can be included into @xmath27 in all orders using technique developed for single - valence electron atoms ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath28 is the two - electron part of the hamiltonian @xmath29 @xmath30 is the two - electron part of core - valence correlations .",
    "it represents screening of coulomb interaction between valence electrons by core electrons .",
    "we calculate @xmath30 in the second order of mbpt .",
    "inclusion of the higher - order correlations into @xmath30 will be a subject of further study .",
    "however , the calculations show that in most cases accurate treatment of @xmath27 is more important than for @xmath30 . the details of the calculation of @xmath27 and @xmath30 can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note however that in contrast to the previous works  @xcite we have no so called _",
    "subtraction diagrams_.    number of electrons @xmath20 is the only parameter in the effective hamiltonian  ( [ heff ] ) which changes when we move between different ions of the same atom .",
    "the terms @xmath23 , @xmath27 and @xmath30 remain exactly the same .",
    "the form of the effective hamiltonian is also the same for all ions if some other potential @xmath17 is used to generate the core states .",
    "however , the @xmath21 operator would have terms proportional to @xmath31 ( subtraction diagrams @xcite ) . in the @xmath0 approximation @xmath32 and",
    "subtraction diagrams disappear .",
    "the mbpt becomes relatively simple which makes it easier to include higher - order core - valence correlations .      to understand how the @xmath0 approximation works it",
    "is very instructive to look at electron shells of a many - electron atom .",
    "we chose lead because it is the heaviest of the considered atoms .",
    "it probably has the richest possible electron shell structure .",
    "neutral lead has eighty two electrons occupying six shells .",
    "angular momentum @xmath33 ranges from 0 ( @xmath15-electrons ) to 3 ( @xmath34-electrons ) .",
    "[ pb1 ] and [ pb2 ] present electron densities of pb  i ( solid line ) and pb  v ( dotted line ) separately for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath35 and @xmath34 electrons .",
    "the density is the sum over principal quantum number @xmath9 , total momentum @xmath14 and its projection @xmath36 while angular momentum @xmath33 is fixed : @xmath37 the values of @xmath38 in the maximum are very different for different @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we present normalized functions @xmath39 to be able to fit all graphs into one diagram .",
    "electron shell structure can be clearly seen on fig .",
    "each density has a local peak at @xmath40 etc .",
    "the position of the peak depends mostly on @xmath9 and is about the same for all @xmath33 .",
    "this means that all electrons with the same @xmath9 are localized at about the same distances regardless of their angular momentum @xmath33 , thus making a shell .",
    "the difference between pb  i and pb  v can not be seen on fig .",
    "[ pb2 ] presents details of the right bottom corner of the fig .",
    "dotted lines which correspond to electron densities of the pb  v ion show no peak at @xmath41 because of absence of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 electrons .",
    "the removal of four valence electrons has some effect on the density of @xmath35-electrons at about the same distances where the @xmath42 and @xmath43 electrons are localized and practically no effect on the densities of all electrons on shorter distances .",
    "this is because valence electrons are localized on large distances and they can only create constant potential in the core which can change the energies of the core states but can not change their wave functions .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ pb2 ] that there is an overlap between the wave functions of valence electrons of pb  i ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 electrons ) and the wave function of the core outermost state @xmath44 .",
    "we have presented for comparison on fig .",
    "[ ba ] the electron densities of ba  i and ba  iii on large distances .",
    "it is easy to see that the overlap between core and valence electrons in barium is much smaller than the overlap between core and valence electrons in lead . as a consequence ,",
    "outermost core state of barium ( @xmath45 ) is much less affected by removal of two @xmath42 electrons than compared to the effect of removal of two @xmath42 and two @xmath43 electrons on the @xmath44 state of lead .",
    "this means that the @xmath46 approximation for ba should work much better than the @xmath23 approximation for pb .",
    "the situation is exactly the same as for the @xmath47 approximation for atoms with one external electron .",
    "it is very well known that the @xmath47 approximation works extremely well for alkali atoms and not so well for atoms like ga , in , tl , etc .",
    "the reason is the same in both cases .",
    "valence electrons must not overlap with the core for the @xmath0 to be good starting approximation regardless of whether @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "similar to the fact that the @xmath47 approximation is a good approximation for thallium , although not as good as for alkali atoms , the @xmath0 approximation is a good approximation for pb , sn and ge , although not as good as for ba .",
    "below we present specifics of calculations for germanium , tin and lead .",
    "germanium is the lightest of three atoms ( @xmath50=32 ) and the easiest from computational point of view .",
    "its ground state configuration is @xmath51 .",
    "the core - valence correlations are relatively small due to small number of electrons in the core .",
    "we calculate @xmath27 and @xmath30 for the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) in the second order of the mbpt .",
    "inclusion of @xmath27 brings single - electron energies of ge  iv to agreement with the experiment on the level of 0.1% .",
    "no higher - order core - valence correlations need to be included .",
    "in fact , inclusion of the higher - order correlations using technique developed in ref .",
    "@xcite does nt lead to better results for germanium .",
    "this is because the technique was developed for heavy atoms in which higher order correlations are dominated by screening of the coulomb interaction between core and valence electrons by other core electrons . in light atoms like germanium",
    "this effect does not dominate due to small number of electrons in the core .",
    "therefore , inclusion of screening , while other higher - order effects are not included , does not improve the accuracy .",
    "the results of calculations are presented in table  [ ge ] .",
    "the ground - state energies are given as energies to remove all valence electrons from an atom or ion ( in atomic units ) .",
    "corresponding experimental energies are sums of the ionization potentials of all relevant ions . for the convenience of comparison with moore s tables",
    "@xcite we present energies of excited states relative to the ground state in @xmath52 . column marked ci presents the results of the standard configuration interaction method without @xmath21 .",
    "column @xmath53 presents the results of calculations with the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) in which @xmath21 is calculated in the second order of mbpt .",
    "the results presented in table  [ ge ] show that inclusion of the core - valence correlations leads to systematic significant improvement of the accuracy of calculations for all states of all ions and for neutral germanium .",

    "it is instructive to compare our results with the results of recent calculations by safronova _",
    "@xcite ( see table  [ pb ] ) .",
    "energy levels of pb  ii were calculated by safronova _",
    "et al _ with the use of the coupled - cluster ( cc ) approach and the third - order mbpt .",
    "the pb  ii ion was treated as an ion with one external electron above closed shells .",
    "therefore only energies of states in which the @xmath42 subshell remained closed were calculated .",
    "the agreement with experiment for these states is slightly better than for our results with @xmath93 .",
    "the reason for this is better treatment of the interaction between core and valence electrons .",
    "the @xmath42 electrons were included in the initial hartree - fock procedure .",
    "also , interaction between the @xmath43 electron and the core is included in the cc approach in all - orders of the mbpt .",
    "this does nt mean that the @xmath23 approximation is not good for lead .",
    "first , as can be seen from table  [ pb ] , inclusion of core - valence correlation does lead to systematic significant improvement of the accuracy and final results are very close to the experiment .",
    "second , the fact that inclusion of the higher order core - valence correlations does nt always lead to improvement of energy intervals does nt mean that the @xmath23 approximation is not good .",
    "it rather means that not all dominating higher - order diagrams are included into @xmath93 .",
    "the situation is very similar to what takes place for single - valence - electron atoms .",
    "the technique developed by us for alkali atoms  @xcite does nt work very well for atoms like thallium where interaction between valence electron and the core is important . here cc+mbpt approach gives better results  @xcite which may mean that the combination of the cc approach with the ci method is a better option for atoms like lead .",
