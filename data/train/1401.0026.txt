    "recently , pusey , barrett , and rudolph ( hereafter abbreviated as pbr ) proved an important theorem , showing that different quantum states represent physically different states of reality @xcite .",
    "differently put , the theorem refutes the idea that one and the same physical reality can be consistently described by two different quantum states .",
    "epr s proof is based on the idea that independent preparation devices can be constructed which can be set up to prepare a quantum system either in a state @xmath0 , or a different state @xmath1 .",
    "an ensemble of @xmath2 copies of this device ( @xmath3 ) can then be used to prepare @xmath2 independent states @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with either @xmath6 or @xmath7 , depending on the preparation @xmath8 of device @xmath9 .",
    "all these states are then destroyed in an @xmath2-partite entanglement measurement . since each device",
    "can be prepared in two different ways , @xmath10 physically different situations can be construced .",
    "epr construct entanglement measurements @xmath11 with @xmath10 different possible outcomes , in such a way that there is a bijective mapping of each of the @xmath10 possible device settings to one outcome which is measured with zero probability if this setting is chosen .",
    "if we assume that there is a non - zero probability of at least @xmath12 that a device produces a physical reality which is compatible with _ both _ states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it follows from the independent preparation of the states that the product state @xmath13 would be compatible with _ all _ possible product states with a probability of at least @xmath14 .",
    "however , this would mean that _ all _ possible outcomes of @xmath11 should be zero , which leads to a contradiction .",
    "thus  given quantum mechanics is correct ",
    "we must conclude that two different quantum states can never be consistent with the same reality .",
    "different proofs have been given , which lead to the same general conclusion @xcite .",
    "the tricky part of the proof by epr is the construction of the basis of the entanglement measurement @xmath11 .",
    "they show that the simplest case @xmath15 is sufficient to proove the theorem only for a subset of possible state pairs @xmath16 that are `` not too close to each other '' ; more precisely , their scalar product must fulfill the inequality @xmath17 . for a general proof , a larger number of independent preparation devices @xmath2 has to be used . here",
    ", i present an argument that even in the general case , it is always possible to track the problem down to the case @xmath15 , rendering the construction of entanglement measurement bases @xmath11 with @xmath3 unnecessary .    in section 2 , i recapitulate the proof for @xmath15 , based on pbr s paper . in section 3 ,",
    "i present the alternative general proof , and section 4 compares both proofs .",
    "two identical devices , labelled by @xmath18 , can be prepared to either produce the quantum state @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "independetly of the dimension if the hilbert space @xmath21 which @xmath19 and @xmath20 are defined in , a basis @xmath22 can always be chosen such that ( possibly after the multiplication of one of the states with a phase @xmath23 , without any effect to the physical state of the system ) @xmath24 thus , the modulus of the scalar product the two is given as @xmath25 the crucial point here is , that regardless of the dimension of @xmath21 , the whole problem can be reduced to two two - dimensional hilbert spaces , treating the quantum state generated by each device as a qbit .",
    "we define the four basis states of the product hilbert space @xmath26 by : @xmath27 on this product space , we define an operator @xmath28 , such that @xmath28 generates all four product states which can be jointly generated by the two devices : @xmath29 in matrix form , @xmath28 is given as @xmath30 a given product state @xmath31 with @xmath32 is now subject to an entanglement measurement , with a measurement basis given by states @xmath33 , @xmath34 generated by a unitary operator @xmath35 which in matrix form is given as @xmath36 with real numbers @xmath37 and @xmath38 . if the measurement returns the output @xmath39 , the quantum system will be projected to the entagled state @xmath33 .",
    "given that the system is prepared in the initial state @xmath31 by a corresponding setup of the two devices , the probability of recieving a measurement output @xmath39 is given as @xmath40 .",
    "pbr show that under certain conditions it is possible to choose @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that given the initial state @xmath31 , the probability of measuring @xmath41 becomes zero .",
    "this is the case if @xmath42 this equation yields for @xmath38 the solution @xmath43 using the identity @xmath44 this equation can also be written as @xmath45 the relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ cosbcosw ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , showing that @xmath47 is only fulfilled in the range @xmath48 . if @xmath49 , @xmath50 becomes larger than @xmath51 , meaning that no real value for @xmath38 can be given in order to fulfill eq .",
    "( [ jmcj ] ) .",
    "the assumption as already mentioned in the introduction , that both devices independently produce a physical state which is compatible with @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath18 at the same time with a non - zero probability of at least @xmath54 , leads to the desired contradiction with eq .",
    "( [ jmcj ] ) : in these cases , the product state would be compatible with all @xmath55 , meaning that all four possible measurement outcomes would get zero probability .",
    "note , however , that this argument fails if @xmath56 , and is thus not sufficient for a general proof .",
    "we now assume arbitrary states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , without any restriction to @xmath46 .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath2 independent copies of the preparation device , with @xmath2 being an even number such that the devices can be divided into two groups , say , group 1 and 2 , each consisting of @xmath57 devices .",
    "we denote the devices in group 1 by @xmath58 , and in group 2 by @xmath59 . all devices in group 1",
    "can be prepared to generate a product state @xmath60 , with either @xmath61 , or @xmath62 . respectively , all deviced in group 2 can be prepared to generate a state @xmath63 .",
    "we can now define : @xmath64 using eq .",
    "( [ def_omega ] ) , the scalar product of these product states fulfills @xmath65 where we define @xmath66 with @xmath67 , in analogy to @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ def_omega ] ) . since @xmath68",
    ", it is always possible to choose @xmath2 large enough such that @xmath69 .",
    "if we now apply the pbr assumption as stated in the introduction , that there is at least the probability @xmath14 that all states @xmath70 , @xmath58 in group 1 and @xmath71 , @xmath59 in group 2 are each compatible with both @xmath19 and @xmath20 , this would imply that with non - zero probability , the product state @xmath72 were compatible with both @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and at the same time , @xmath75 were compatible with both @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus , we can to perform the replacements @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 and repeat the two - qbit proof given in section 2 for the product states @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this is possible , since in eq .",
    "( [ basis_qbit ] ) there is no restriction to the hilbert space in which the two states are defined in . using these replacements , we yield a general proof of the pbr theorem , by reducing it to the two - qbit case .",
    "pbr prove the general case by constructing a hierarchy of multi - partite entanglement measurements , where the number of independently prepared quantum states @xmath2 must be chosen such that @xmath83 which is equivalent to @xmath84 where again the identity eq .",
    "( [ tan_cos_identity ] ) has been used .",
    "the proof presented here is identical to pbr s for the case @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath85 , being equivalent to @xmath86 otherwise , according to eq .",
    "( [ def_gross_omega ] ) , @xmath2 has to be chosen such that @xmath87 leading to the condition @xmath88 with @xmath2 being an even number , for the choice of @xmath2 .",
    "the minimal number of @xmath2 to prove the theorm with a given value of @xmath89 , is give in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] for both the pbr prove and the alternative proof , as given by eqs .",
    "( [ n_pbr ] ) and ( [ n_alternative ] ) , respectively .",
    "the graph shows , that a larger number of indepentend preparation devices is necessary for the alternative proof , if @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , we could state that bpr s original proof is more `` efficient '' . on the other hand , the proof presented here works without the construction of a non - trivial multi - partite entanglement measurement basis for more than two qbits , but rests on a simple argument in the case where bpr s proof does not work with two qbits only .",
    "it shows that the general case follows immediately from the two qbit case .",
    "it is therefore simpler than the proof given by pbr .",
