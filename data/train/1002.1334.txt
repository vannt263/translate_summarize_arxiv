    "such an analysis yields an effective dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction between dimers on adjacent bilayers connected by the @xmath10 and @xmath11 exchange constants : @xmath83 with @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "microscopically , this process turns one singlet into an @xmath19 triplet or vice versa .",
    "this effective dm coupling between pseudo - spins results from two important symmetry considerations .",
    "first , the singlet and the triplet states of a given dimer have opposite parity under exchange of the two sites of the dimer : @xmath88 .",
    "second , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms of @xmath76 are invariant under the inversion symmetry transformation around the center of the corresponding bonds : @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( see fig . [ twod](a ) ) .",
    "this implies that a dm term is allowed between pseudo - spins connected by the @xmath10 and @xmath11 exchanges .",
    "in contrast , the effective dm interaction can not occur for pairs of dimers within a plane because the @xmath90 and @xmath91 terms of @xmath76 are invariant under the symmetry transformation @xmath89 , while the effective dm interaction changes sign under such transformation .",
    "these symmetries are fundamentally equivalent to the selection rules governing the dm vector in the effective lattice , where each dimer constitutes a single , unique site . in such a lattice",
    ", there is a center of inversion symmetry at the midpoint of the effective @xmath90 and @xmath91 exchange , precluding a dm term by the normal selection rules , while no such inversion symmetry exists at the midpoints of the effective @xmath10 and @xmath11 exchanges .",
    "this is contrast to the symmetries of the @xmath92 lattice , where there are inversion symmetries at the midpoint of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 exchanges but none at the midpoint of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 exchanges .",
    "that leads to eq .",

    "field direction along @xmath49 axis , @xmath94 along @xmath95 axis , and @xmath3 axis vertical.,width=302 ]    this effective dm interaction between dimers on adjacent layers is frustrated in both ordered states at a mean field level ( the mean value of eq .",
    "( [ efff2 ] ) is zero for the semi - classical states associated with phases i and ii ) .",
    "therefore , the small contribution of the effective dm interaction to the ground state energy must be produced by quantum fluctuations . because the dm vectors point along the @xmath95 direction ( perpendicular to the applied field and to the easy @xmath3 axis ) this contribution term will favor phase ii , for which the pseudo - spins only have @xmath96 and @xmath49 components ( fig .",
    "[ twod](b)(ii ) ) , as opposed to phase i for which the pseudo - spins have an additional third component along the @xmath95 direction ( fig .",
    "[ twod](b)(i ) ) @xcite .",
    "thus this contribution strengthens phase ii relative to phase i near @xmath82 and leads to a small non - monotonic behavior of the @xmath40 curve ( see fig .",
    "[ torq ] ) .",
    "although this simple analysis captures the qualitative non - monotonic behavior of the @xmath40 curve , it can not account for the magnitude of the observed effect .",
    "the amplitude @xmath97 of the effective dm interaction is of order 100 mk for @xmath98 . because the interaction mixes the singlet and @xmath19 triplet dimer states , the mean value of the dm term is less than @xmath99 for any state with magnetization @xmath100 ( the mean density of @xmath19 triplets ) .",
    "noting that @xmath101 at @xmath40 , the upper bound on the dm term of @xmath102 mk is the order of magnitude of the observed non - monotonic effect of 5 - 10 mk in the @xmath40 curve .",
    "given that @xmath103 is much weaker than the dominant terms of @xmath76 , it is clear that the effective dm term can only explain the magnitude of the non - monotonic effect if it gives a first order contribution to the energy of phase ii .",
    "however , as established above for the proposed ordered states , the effective dm interaction contributes via a second order correction and must therefore be considerably smaller .",
    "this leaves us with two possibilities : a ) the magnetic structure of phase ii is different from the simple ising phase proposed in ref . [ ] in such a way that the mean value of the effective dm term is non - zero , or b ) the non - monotonic effect is caused by a term that has not been included in @xmath76 . at present",
    "it is impossible to distinguish between these possibilities , but ongoing efforts to experimentally determine the magnetic structure have the potential to directly address option ( a ) , while epr experiments should , at least in principle , be able to determine the energy scale of additional interactions not considered in the minimal spin hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) .",
    "in summary , via heat capacity and torque magnetometry measurements we have established the angular dependence of the phase boundary for singlet - triplet ordered states of ba@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the data reveal a striking non - monotonicity of the phase boundary as the field is rotated between the principal axes .",
    "the angle - dependence of @xmath5 can be quantitatively understood in terms of the original minimal spin hamiltonian that we had proposed for this material .",
    "this quantity does not depend on details of the magnetically ordered states but only on the minimum of the triplet dispersion .",
    "however , the observed non - monotonicity in @xmath104 is at least an order of magnitude larger than anticipated based on this model and assuming the magnetic structures previously proposed .",
