    "the mechanism for breaking the symmetry of the electroweak interactions has not been directly accessed in experiments thus far .",
    "one possibility is that the higgs boson is so heavy that it will not be produced even in the next generation of colliders . in this case and in other strongly interacting symmetry - breaking scenarios , it is interesting to parametrize the symmetry - breaking sector in a model independent way through the use of chiral lagrangians @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the low energy effects of new physics are represented by an infinite tower of non - renormalizable effective operators which are consistent with the @xmath12 symmetry of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the lowest order chiral lagrangian exhibits an universal behavior for the dynamics of the electroweak interactions , being independent of the details of the mechanism of symmetry - breaking .",
    "however , at the next - to - leading order in the chiral expansion , there are 14 effective operators whose coefficients are dictated by the underlying dynamics . among the next - to - leading operators , there is only one that is cp conserving but parity violating @xcite .",
    "this operator also breaks the custodial @xmath13 symmetry @xcite and is given by @xmath14 where the dimensionless unitary unimodular matrix @xmath15 contains the would - be goldstone bosons @xmath16 , @xmath17 gev is the symmetry - breaking scale , the @xmath18 covariant derivative is @xmath19 and the field strength tensors are written in terms of @xmath20 @xmath21 \\right ) \\ ; , \\\\",

    "@xcite , we have the correspondence for the triple gauge - boson vertex @xmath25 where we denote the sine ( cosine ) of the weak mixing angle by @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . the expected size of @xmath0 depends upon whether or not the underlying dynamics respects the custodial symmetry . in models with a custodial symmetry , @xmath0 should be of the order of @xmath28 , while for models without this symmetry we expect @xmath29 .    at low energies , the bounds on this operator come from one - loop contributions to meson decays and to the vertex @xmath30 . from the study of the decay @xmath31 , we obtain limits of the order @xmath32 @xcite , while the precise measurements of the @xmath33 flavor diagonal couplings imply that @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "these bounds are obtained using the naturalness assumption that no cancellations take place between contributions from different anomalous interactions .",
    "however , a closer look at the interaction ( [ lag : gz5 ] ) reveals that it is momentum dependent , and consequently it can be better studied directly in processes at high energies .    the next linear @xmath2 collider ( nlc ) @xcite will reach a center - of - mass energy between 500 and 2000 gev with an yearly integrated luminosity of at least @xmath9 fb@xmath10 .",
    "an interesting feature of this new machine is the possibility of transforming an electron beam into a photon one through the laser backscattering mechanism @xcite .",
    "this process will allow the nlc to operate in three different modes , @xmath2 , @xmath11 , and @xmath5 , opening up the opportunity for a wider search for new physics .",
    "however , it is important to stress that the collider can operate in only one of its three modes at a given time , therefore , it is imperative to study comparatively the different features of each of these setups .",
    "previously , the phenomenological implications of the operator ( [ lag : gz5 ] ) to the reaction @xmath35 at high energies were analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which showed that it is possible to obtain limits of the order of @xmath36 for a center - of - mass energy of 500 gev .",
    "however , this sensitivity to @xmath0 can only be achieved for a high degree of @xmath37 polarization .",
    "this interaction was also studied in @xmath11 collisions in ref.@xcite through the process @xmath38 , that will be able to lead to constraints @xmath39 for a center - of - mass energy of 500 gev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath9 fb@xmath10 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the bounds obtained in the above processes originate from the direct tree - level contributions of the anomalous interaction .    in this work",
    "we examine the capability of the next generation of @xmath2 colliders operating in the @xmath5 mode to place direct bounds on the effective operator ( [ lag : gz5 ] ) through the reaction @xmath40 @xcite . in a @xmath5 collider",
    ", this process exhibits tree - level contributions from the anomalous interaction ( [ lag : gz5 ] ) and contains the minimum number of final state particles .",
    "we show that for a center - of - mass of @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) gev it is possible to obtain bounds @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) for an integrated luminosity of @xmath9 fb@xmath10 .",
    "the most promising mechanism to generate hard photon beams in an @xmath45 linear collider is laser backscattering .",
    "assuming unpolarized electron and laser beams , the backscattered photon distribution function @xcite is @xmath46 \\ ; , \\label{f : l}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the compton cross section , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the electron mass and energy respectively , and @xmath52 is the laser - photon energy .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 stands for the ratio between the scattered photon and initial electron energy and its maximum value is @xmath54 in what follows , we assume that the laser frequency is such that @xmath55 , which leads to the hardest possible spectrum of photons with a large luminosity .    the cross section for @xmath56 production via @xmath5 fusion can be obtained by folding the elementary cross section for the subprocesses @xmath57 with the photon - photon luminosity ( @xmath58 ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is the @xmath2 ( @xmath5 ) center - of - mass energy , @xmath62 , and the photon - photon luminosity is @xmath63    the analytical calculation of the cross section for the subprocess @xmath57 requires the evaluation of 12 feynman diagrams in the unitary gauge and it is very lengthy and tedious despite being straightforward .",
    "we evaluated numerically the helicity amplitudes for this process using the techniques outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to obtain our results in an efficient and reliable way . as a check of our results",
    ", we explicitly verified that the amplitudes were lorentz and @xmath64 invariant .",
    "the phase space integrations were performed numerically using the monte carlo routine vegas @xcite .",
    "the total cross section for the process @xmath65 is a quadratic function of the anomalous coupling @xmath0 , _ i.e. _ @xmath66 where @xmath67 stands for the sm cross section @xcite and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is the interference ( pure anomalous ) contribution .",
    "we evaluated these contributions for unpolarized backscattered photons imposing that the polar angles of the produced vector bosons with the beam pipe are larger than @xmath70 . in table",
    "[ sigmas : z ] , we present our results for several @xmath2 center - of - mass energies . the interference term vanishes since the anomalous amplitude has a phase of @xmath71 with respect to the standard model amplitude for an unpolarized initial state .",
    "in order to quantify the effect of the new couplings , we defined the statistical significance @xmath72 of the anomalous signal @xmath73 which can be easily evaluated using the parametrization ( [ base ] ) with the coefficients given in table [ sigmas : z ] .",
    "we list in table [ const ] the values of the anomalous couplings that correspond to a @xmath74 effect in the total cross section for the different center - of - mass energies of the associated @xmath2 collider , assuming an integrated luminosity @xmath75 fb@xmath10 . from this table",
    ", we can learn that a @xmath5 collider leads to bounds on @xmath0 that are better than the ones that can be obtained in the usual @xmath2 mode .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 and @xmath11 collider lead to similar constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "the kinematical distributions of the final state particles can be used , at least in principle , to increase the sensitivity of the @xmath5 reactions to anomalous interactions , improving consequently the bounds on them . in order to reach a better understanding of the effects of the anomalous interaction ( [ lag : gz5 ] ) in the reaction @xmath76 , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig:1][fig:3 ] various representative distributions of the final state gauge bosons , adopting the values of the anomalous coupling constants that lead to a @xmath74 deviation in the total cross section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show the normalized distribution in the rapidity @xmath77 of the @xmath78 for a center - of - mass energy of @xmath3 and @xmath4 tev .",
    "the distributions for @xmath79 and @xmath80 coincide due to the absence of the interference term in the cross section .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the anomalous coupling @xmath0 enhances the production of @xmath78 in the central region of the detector , where they can be more easily reconstructed .",
    "furthermore , increasing the center of mass energy , the @xmath81 s tend to populate the high rapidity region , as it happens in the process @xmath82 .",
    "consequently , the cut in the @xmath81 angle with beam pipe discards a larger fraction of events at high energies .",
    "the normalized invariant mass distributions of @xmath83 pairs are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for a center - of - mass energy of @xmath3 and @xmath4 tev .",
    "once again the @xmath84 and @xmath85 curves coincide . from this figure",
    "we can learn that the presence of the anomalous interaction increases slightly the invariant mass of the @xmath83 pairs since the new couplings are proportional to the photon momentum .",
    "moreover , as the center - of - mass energy of the collider is increased , the distributions broaden and shift toward higher invariant masses .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the laboratory energy distribution of the @xmath33 gauge boson . as we can see from this figure",
    ", the introduction of the anomalous interaction favors the production of more energetic @xmath33 bosons , because of the new momentum - dependent couplings . at lower center - of - mass energies the distribution is rather peaked around small values for the energy of the @xmath33 boson because of the available phase space .",
    "however , as the center - of - mass energy of the collider increases , the distributions broaden , exhibiting many @xmath33 bosons with high energies .",
    "up to this point we were able to demonstrate that a @xmath5 collider can reveal the existence of an anomalous interaction such as the one described by ( [ lag : gz5 ] ) .",
    "however , the determination that the anomalous events are because of this interaction is a much harder task . in principle this could be done through the study of kinematical distributions .",
    "notwithstanding , several anomalous interactions lead to distributions similar to the ones that we presented , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite . the effective operator ( [ lag : gz5 ] )",
    "could be singled out through the forward - backward asymmetry associated to parity violation , however , this does not happen for unpolarized photons since the interference term vanishes , see table [ sigmas : z ] .",
    "therefore , in order to determine which anomalous interaction is responsible for the anomalous events we must employ polarized backscattered photons . as an illustration , we show in fig.[fig:4 ] the normalized @xmath78 rapidity distributions for the subprocess @xmath86 with @xmath87 tev , assuming that one photon has a left - handed polarization while the other is right - handed . as we can see from this figure , the rapidity distribution for the @xmath79 and @xmath80 do not coincide , despite the result being clearly @xmath88 invariant .",
    "this a feature unique to the anomalous interaction ( [ lag : gz5 ] ) .",
    "we analyzed in this work the capability of an @xmath2 collider operating in the @xmath5 mode to unravel the existence of the anomalous interaction ( [ lag : gz5 ] ) .",
    "we demonstrated that for a center - of - mass energy of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) tev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath9 fb@xmath10 , the study of the reaction @xmath89 can lead to bounds @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "these bounds are similar to the ones that can be obtained in the @xmath11 mode of the collider and are better than the one steaming from the usual @xmath2 mode . moreover , at higher energies the luminosity of @xmath5 colliders can be larger than the corresponding @xmath11 because of problems in the construction this last mode @xcite .",
