    "the phenomenology of high-@xmath8 superconductors ( htsc ) has brought several fundamental issues @xcite .",
    "one of these issues is certainly the nature of the pseudogap found in some of those materials . in the possible competing scenarios on the nature of the pseudogap",
    ", one should mention two of them . assuming that the pseudogap occurs below a temperature @xmath9 : ( i )",
    "the pseudogap would be due to the formation of incoherent pairs until that a superconducting phase develops below the critical temperature @xmath10 @xcite ; ( ii ) the pseudogap would be due to short - range fluctuations of magnetic nature which below a certain temperature @xmath11 would give rise an ordered state ending at a quantum critical point ( qcp ) which can coexist with the sc phase @xcite . nevertheless , despite of the intense debate ,",
    "the complete explanation for the nature of the pseudogap is clearly an unsolved question .",
    "quite recently , an attractive hubbard model with non - local interaction @xcite has been considered using a two pole approximation @xcite .",
    "although our model is not fully realistic for htsc , it allows superconductivity with @xmath12wave symmetry @xcite and also can be quite useful to bring information on the possible sources of the pseudogap . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been obtained the evolution of the fermi surface from a closed shape to a hole pocket shape as well as the behavior of the @xmath13 with a maximum at @xmath14 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , and then , decreasing when @xmath15 .",
    "remarkably , both results can be traced from one single mechanism , i. e. , from short range antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations . to be precise , for a proper range of temperature and doping these correlations distort the renormalized quasi - particles bands shifting by @xmath16 the flat region on the anti - nodal points ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) to energies below the chemical potential @xcite . as a consequence , a pseudogap @xmath17 , emerges in the dos close to the chemical potential .",
    "the mechanism discussed in the previous paragraph also favors the existence of @xmath18-wave superconductivity in the attractive non - local hubbard model @xcite .",
    "this occurs because the magnetic correlations enhance the density of states at the van hove singularity ( vhs ) providing more electrons able to form superconducting pairs .",
    "it should be noticed , that is exactly the non - locality of the attractive interacting term which triggers the short range af correlations within the two pole approximation for the attractive hubbard model .",
    "the electronic specific heat @xmath19 is an important quantity giving relevant information about the pseudogap and the mechanisms behind it . mostly important",
    ", the close relation between the specific heat and the density of states allows a theoretical investigation about effects of correlations , in particular , the magnetic ones .",
    "therefore , we present here a systematic study of the specific heat using the attractive non - local hubbard model within the two pole approximation . this approximation allows to deal properly with the regime of strong correlations .",
    "in particular , we assume that there is also next - neighbor hopping .",
    "as will be shown below , this hopping furnishes an additional mechanism to amplify magnetic correlations and , therefore modifies the dos , thus affecting the specific heat .",
    "the model investigated is a two - dimensional one - band hubbard model @xcite which is given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath22 with spin @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the number operator .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 represents the hopping between sites @xmath22 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 indicates the sum over the first and the second - nearest - neighbors of @xmath22 and @xmath28 is the chemical potential .",
    "the second term in @xmath29 takes into account the interaction between the electrons in which @xmath2 is a non - local attractive potential .",
    "the bare dispersion relation is given by @xmath30 + 4t_{2}\\cos ( k_{x}a ) \\cos ( k_{y}a)$ ] where @xmath31 is the first - neighbor and @xmath32 is the second - neighbor hopping amplitudes and @xmath33 is the lattice parameter .    in the two - poles approximation proposed by roth @xcite , the green s function matrix is defined as @xmath34 in which @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the normalization and the energy matrices , respectively @xcite .",
    "the specific heat is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the energy per atom  and @xmath39 the temperature .",
    "in the grand canonical ensemble , the energy is a function of the chemical potential @xmath40 , where @xmath41 changes with the temperature .",
    "therefore , the calculation of @xmath19 must be performed keeping @xmath42 constant in the @xmath43 plane @xcite .",
    "the energy per atom is @xmath44 ( @xmath45 being the number of sites of the system ) and can be written as @xcite : @xmath46d{\\omega } \\label{eqe } % \\end{align}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the fermi function and @xmath48 is a green s function of the type @xmath49 with the spectral weights @xmath50 and the renormalized bands @xmath51 defined in app ( [ app : a ] ) .    combining @xmath37 with equations ( [ eqe ] ) and ( [ eqg ] ) we obtain @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the function @xmath55 is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the spin - spin correlation function discussed in the numerical results section is given by : @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 defined in app ( [ app : a ] ) .",
    "the specific heat for the hubbard model with only nearest neighbor hopping , is shown in the left panel in figure [ fig111 ] , for @xmath62 and different values for the interaction @xmath2 . for @xmath63 ,",
    "the specific heat presents a schottky anomaly @xcite with a maximum at @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath65 is increased , the peak in @xmath64 is preserved and a second peak emerges in @xmath66 , as can be observed for @xmath67 . for high values of @xmath65 , for instance @xmath68 , the peak at low temperature dominates and the specific heat shows only a single peak .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig111 ] shows the spin - spin correlation function @xmath69 .",
    "another feature observed in @xmath19 is the presence of a crossing point in @xmath70 .",
    "such crossing point is a characteristic of the specific heat of many correlated systems @xcite .    in order to understanding the temperature dependence of @xmath19 ,",
    "let us analyze @xmath71 and @xmath72 defined above .",
    "figure [ gwfwfwg](a ) shows @xmath72 for @xmath62 and different values of @xmath2 .",
    "the figure [ gwfwfwg](b ) presents @xmath73 for @xmath67 and different values of @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath71 is shown in figure [ gwfwfwg](c ) .",
    "the @xmath72 shown in figure [ gwfwfwg](a ) presents an important feature , namely , both the positive area associated to the lower hubbard band and the negative area related to the upper hubbard band enhance as @xmath65 increases . as a consequence ,",
    "the low temperature peak on @xmath19 is favored by @xmath2 while the high temperature peak is suppressed by @xmath2 , as can be observed in figure [ fig111 ] . for intermediate values of @xmath2",
    ", there is a temperature in which the negative area in @xmath72 associated to the upper hubbard band gives the maximum contribution to @xmath71 leading to a local minimum in @xmath19 at this temperature .",
    "this is the reason why at moderated values of @xmath2 , both the low and high temperature peaks coexist on @xmath19 as can be observed in figure [ fig111 ] , for @xmath67 .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig111 ] shows that @xmath75 is large at low temperatures and increases with @xmath65 . as discussed in references",
    "@xcite , the @xmath69 modify the renormalized band structure by enlarging the flat region near the anti - nodal points @xmath76 and @xmath77 . as a consequence ,",
    "a pronounced peak emerges on the density of state . if such peak is near the chemical potential it gives a strong contribution to the specific heat . at high temperatures @xmath75 decreases and",
    "its effect becomes negligible .",
    "the density of states for different temperatures and @xmath2 are shown in figure [ dos ] . in [ dos](a ) , @xmath78 and the chemical potential @xmath41 intercepts the density of states @xmath79 below the peak associated to a vhs , for all values of temperatures shown in the figure . in [ dos](b ) , in which @xmath67 , @xmath80 is maximum for @xmath81 , while for @xmath82 , @xmath41 intercepts @xmath79 after the vhs where @xmath83 ( see the inset ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the specific heat presents a peak just at @xmath81 and a local minimum at @xmath82 ( see figure [ fig111 ] ) .",
    "this occurs because at low temperatures the function @xmath54 ( @xmath47 is the fermi function ) is very close to the chemical potential . in this case",
    "the position of chemical potential on @xmath79 plays an important role . for @xmath68 , figure [ dos](c ) shows that the chemical potential intercepts @xmath79 on the vhs when @xmath81 .",
    "however , for @xmath82 and @xmath84 , @xmath41 is found within the gap , where @xmath85 .",
    "figure [ cn](a ) shows the specific heat for different values of @xmath86 .",
    "notice that when @xmath86 decreases the peak at low temperature disappears .",
    "this occurs because the @xmath75 becomes small decreasing the density of states at the vhs .",
    "moreover , the low occupation moves the chemical potential @xmath41 away from the vhs . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath86 increases , @xmath75 is enhanced , @xmath41 moves closer to the vhs and as consequence the low temperature peak in @xmath19 enlarges .",
    "figure [ cn](b ) shows the spin - spin correlation function @xmath69 for the same parameters as in the upper panel .",
    "figure [ cn](c ) shows that at low temperatures , the specific heat exhibits a maximum for a given @xmath86 . at high temperatures",
    "the maximum disappears .",
    "figure [ cn](d ) displays the spin - spin correlation function @xmath69 for the same parameters as in the upper panel .",
    "the figure [ ctl](a ) presents the specific heat as a function of temperature for different values of the second nearest - neighbors amplitude @xmath88 .",
    "the low temperature peak in the specific heat is strongly enhanced by @xmath89 .",
    "this occurs because @xmath88 enhances @xmath69 and enlarges the flat regions on the renormalized bands resulting in a high density of states on the vhs . as a consequence , the low temperature peak on @xmath19 increases while the high temperature peak is not affected because temperature suppresses @xmath69 .",
    "the lower panel in figure [ ctl](b ) shows the behavior of @xmath69 for the same parameters as in [ ctl](a ) .",
    "figure [ ctl](c ) shows that the effects of @xmath89 on @xmath19 are more intensive at low temperatures where @xmath69 is stronger .",
    "furthermore , there is a maximum on @xmath19 in @xmath90 but , this maximum does not show at high temperatures .",
    "figure [ ctl](d ) shows @xmath69 for the same parameters has in [ ctl](c ) . in figure [ w1z1 ]",
    "we present the renormalized band structures and the effective spectral weights for @xmath91 and several values of @xmath89 .",
    "we observe that a pseudogap @xmath92 emerges from @xmath93 and persists until @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , the pseudogap is maximum for @xmath95 which is just the value of @xmath89 for which @xmath19 is maximum ( see figure [ ctl ] ) .",
    "the inset in the upper panel of figure [ w1z1 ] shows in detail the pseudogap @xmath92 for @xmath96 . indeed , for @xmath96 ,",
    "the presence of the pseudogap gives rise to a wide flattening in @xmath97 along the direction @xmath77-@xmath98 , which increases the density of states at the vhs and also produces a peak on @xmath72 .",
    "when @xmath89 increases , the pseudogap opens and the region of @xmath99 near @xmath77 becomes positive resulting in an enhancement of the specific heat .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath100 , the pseudogap starts to decrease and closes for @xmath101 .",
    "the lower panel in figure [ w1z1 ] shows that the negative region on @xmath102 increases with @xmath89 .",
    "however , at low temperatures such regions do not contribute to @xmath19 because they are associated to the upper hubbard band .",
    "on the other hand , when the temperature increases , the negative regions of @xmath102 become relevant and affect the specific heat ( see @xmath19 for @xmath103 in the upper panel in figure [ ctl](c ) ) .",
    "figure [ figpg ] displays the temperature @xmath104 below which a pseudogap appears on the renormalized band as shown in figure [ w1z1 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the pseudogap lines are displayed for different intensities @xmath89 and a common feature is that @xmath105 increases with the total occupation @xmath86 .",
    "nevertheless , we observed that from @xmath106 to @xmath107 the pseudogap lines start in ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "this occurs because above @xmath109 and below a critical value of @xmath105 , the spin - spin correlations become so strong that distort the renormalized band sufficiently to close the pseudogap .",
    "therefore , in the present scenario , the pseudogap is observed in a range of @xmath2 , @xmath88 , @xmath86 and @xmath110 in which the spin - spin correlations are typical for a ( @xmath111 ) regime .",
    "the inset in figure [ figpg ] shows the pseudogap line as a function of @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath105 increases with @xmath65 because @xmath2 favors the correlations @xmath75 ( see the right panel of figure [ fig111 ] ) which , in the present scenario , are responsible for the pseudogap . for @xmath112 ,",
    "the systems becomes weakly correlated and the pseudogap closes because the chemical potential reaches the upper hubbard band .",
    "the specific heat @xmath19 of an attractive extended hubbard model has been studied within a two - pole approximation @xcite .",
    "it has been verified that @xmath19 as a function of temperature shows a two peak structure . a systematic analysis of @xmath19 in terms of the renormalized band structure allowed us to identify the mechanisms behind the two peak structure .",
    "indeed , the low temperature peak is associated to the lower hubbard band while the high temperature peak is related to the upper hubbard band .",
    "if @xmath41 is near a van hove singularity ( vhs ) the low temperature peak is enhanced due to the close relation between specific heat and density of states . on the other hand",
    ", the upper hubbard band contributes with a positive and also a negative portion for @xmath19 . for small @xmath2 ,",
    "the contribution is positive but when @xmath65 increases the negative portion dominates and the high temperature peak on @xmath19 is suppressed .",
    "it should be stressed that the af magnetic correlations associated to the spin - spin correlation function @xmath69 affect the behavior of the peaks on the specific heat .",
    "this occurs because @xmath69 changes the renormalized band structure resulting in an enhancement or a decrease of the density of states , mainly , on the vhs .",
    "the lower temperature peak is more affected by this effect because the vhs contributes significantly to that peak which is the only one preserved when @xmath65 increases .",
    "the low temperature peak is also deeply dependent on the occupation @xmath86 . at low @xmath86",
    "the chemical potential @xmath41 is far from the vhs .",
    "therefore , the low density of states on @xmath41 is not sufficient to induces the low temperature peak on @xmath19 .",
    "it has been verified that if the second nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath89 is present , these same @xmath69 correlations induce a pseudogap on the renormalized band structure .",
    "the pseudogap opens at the anti - nodal points @xmath6 and @xmath7 suggesting a @xmath18-wave symmetry for it .",
    "nevertheless , the pseudogap and the two peak structure on @xmath19 do not coexist .",
    "indeed , the second nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath89 enhances the spin - spin correlations which increases the low temperature peak on @xmath19 and suppresses the high temperature peak .    in summary",
    ", the present results for an attractive non - local hubbard model suggest that in presence of a pseudogap the specific heat has a single peak structure which is closely related to short - range af magnetic correlations .",
