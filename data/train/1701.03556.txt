    "this discrepancy can be understood since only took dense regions into account and did not apply the correction factor .",
    "assuming that the two clouds make the same contribution to the mass of the intersection , we arrive at a mass of 1.2@xmath23  @xmath24 for l1188a and 2.7@xmath23  @xmath24 for l1188b .    in order to investigate the velocity structure , we make position - velocity diagrams along the long axes of l1188a and l1188b shown in fig .",

    "furthermore , we can see that both l1188a and l1188b have small velocity spreads of @xmath72  kms@xmath8 at the 3@xmath18 level of @xmath2co emission .",
    "in contrast , the intersection of the two clouds shows a larger velocity spread of @xmath75  kms@xmath8 , indicating that molecular gas in this region is more turbulent .",
    "the region showing such a large velocity spread has a size of 20 , corresponding to a physical scale of 4.7 pc .",
    "figure  [ fig : coll]a shows the @xmath1co excitation temperature map . in the intersection , we find an open arc structure which has excitation temperatures ( 1822  k ) higher than those ( @xmath2515  k ) of ambient gas .",
    "the radius of curvature of the arc structure is found to be about 0.6 pc .",
    "in addition , the arc structure appears to be enhanced in both @xmath1co and @xmath2co emission ( see fig .  [",

    "we find widespread emission showing broad @xmath1co line wings ( see three examples in fig .  [",
    "fig : coll]c ) , indicating that molecular gas in the arc structure is perturbed by shocks .",
    "we use the wise data @xcite and the criteria introduced by @xcite to search for class i and class ii ysos in the observed region . as a result",
    ", we found 228 yso candidates , among which 31 are class i and 197 are class ii .",
    "figure  [ fig : sf]a shows the distribution of these yso candidates . in l1188 , there are several regions showing overdense yso candidates . what we are interested is the one located at the intersection of l1188a and l1188b . in this intersection ,",
    "twenty - eight yso candidates , including 3 class i and 25 class ii yso candidates , are found to be clustered around the arc structure .",
    "this is indicative of enhanced star formation . in the arc structure ,",
    "we also discover two c@xmath3o cores , labeled as c1 and c2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf]b .",
    "their deconvolved radii are found to be 0.22 pc and 0.16 pc . by assuming lte and a constant [ @xmath26o/@xmath3o ] isotopic ratio of 560 , their core masses are found to be 35  @xmath24 and 15  @xmath24 by summing up all column densities inside the contour of 0.6  k  kms@xmath8(see fig .",
    "[ fig : sf]b ) .",
    "c1 is more elongated and massive than c2 .",
    "compared with the empirical mass - size relationship for the formation of massive stars @xcite , the two cores are unlikely to form massive stars .",
    "the two @xmath1co high velocity wings ( w1 and w2 ) revealed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv]b are indicative of outflows driven by ysos . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pv]a , w1 is likely associated with c1 .",
    "however , we can not resolve the outflows with our data due to the limited angular resolution and the contamination from ambient clouds .",
    "in sect .  [ sec.mor ] , we suggest that l1188 consists of two nearly orthogonal filamentary molecular clouds . although the morphology can be alternatively explained by cores accretion from the surrounding filament material which was believed to play an important role in the formation of the embedded serpens south protocluster @xcite , this does nt seem to be the case for l1188 .",
    "such filamentary accretion flows will display self - absorption in optically thick emission and a single peaked profile in optically thin emission , which is not found in our data .",
    "instead , our @xmath2co data has low optical depths ( @xmath250.5 ) and show two distinct peaks , which supports that the two velocity components arise from two clouds rather than accretion flows .",
    "we also find several pieces of evidence to support the idea that l1188a and l1188b are colliding with each other .",
    "firstly , bridging features connect the two clouds in velocity , which points out that the two clouds are interacting @xcite .",
    "secondly , the intersection of the two clouds show large velocity spreads , indicative of more turbulent motions .",
    "this agrees with results given by simulations of cloud - cloud collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thirdly , an arc structure exhibiting high excitation temperatures , enhanced @xmath1co and @xmath2co emission , and broad @xmath1co line wings is found in the intersection of the two clouds .",
    "such a structure could result from stellar feedback .",
    "however , we do not find hii regions or ysos toward the center of the arc structure to our knowledge .",
    "instead , the open arc structure has been successfully created by simulations of cloud - cloud collisions where the arc - like layer is formed due to the shock compression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "toward the arc structure , the widespread gas showing broad @xmath1co line wings reinforce the presence of shocks .",
    "furthermore , there is lack of ysos around the positions showing such wings , indicating that the shocks arise from the cloud - cloud collision .",
    "we note that such wing profile is seldom reported in the other cloud - cloud candidates mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .    from the systemic velocities of the two clouds ,",
    "their velocity difference is about 2.5  kms@xmath8which is a lower limit of the relative collision velocity due to the projection effect .",
    "previous studies suggest that the velocity spread in the shocked layer is similar to the relative collision velocity @xcite .",
    "we thus roughly assume the relative collision velocity to be 5  kms@xmath8 .",
    "the collision velocity is also in consistent with simulations of small clouds which predicted an open arc dense structure at the assumed relative collision velocity @xcite .",
    "compared with the velocity difference , the relative collision velocity implies that the relative motion of the two clouds is about 60to the line of sight . assuming an effective radius of 5 pc for l1188",
    ", we estimate that a mass of 2.4@xmath22  @xmath24 is required to gravitationally bind the two clouds , which is six times the observed lte mass ( 3.9@xmath23  @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , the total mass of l1188 is too small to gravitationally bind the two clouds .    given that star forming activities are found in the intersection , we propose a scenario that star formation is triggered by a collision of molecular clouds in l1188 .",
    "the relative collision velocity of 5  kms@xmath8gives a transverse velocity of 4.3  kms@xmath8 .",
    "assuming that the perturbed region showing large velocity spreads in fig .",
    "[ fig : pv]b is ascribable to the collision , this implies that l1188a and l1188b collided with each other about a timescale of 4.7 pc divided by 4.3  kms@xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath271 myr ago .",
    "such a timescale is longer than the lifetime ( @xmath70.5 myr ) of class i ysos and comparable to the lifetime ( 2@xmath171 myr ) of class ii ysos @xcite , which means that the yso candidates in the region are possible to form after the collision between l1188a and l1188b .",
    "this implies that these stars are possible to be triggered by the collision .",
    "together with the geometric simplicity of l1188 , the cloud complex is unlikely to form massive stars , which makes it one of the best candidates to further study cloud - cloud collision triggering the formation of the low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "based on the 3d extinction map , we perform the distance estimate toward l1188 which is found to be @xmath7800 pc . we present a new large - scale ( 2@xmath02 ) mapping of l1188 in the three co isotopic lines with the pmo 13.7-m telescope .",
    "we unveil that l1188 , displaying a cross - like morphology , consists of two nearly orthogonal filamentary molecular clouds ( l1188a and l1188b ) with systemic velocities of about @xmath510.5 and @xmath58.0  kms@xmath8 .",
    "the total mass of l1188 is 3.9@xmath23  m@xmath28 , unable to bind the two clouds . toward the intersection of the two clouds which shows large velocity spreads , we find several bridging features connecting the two clouds in velocity , and an open arc structure which exhibits high excitation temperatures , enhanced @xmath1co and @xmath2co emission , and broad @xmath1co line wings",
    "this is in consistent with the scenario that the two clouds are colliding with each other .",
    "an overdense distribution of young stellar object candidates is found in the intersection of the two clouds , indicative of enhanced star formation .",
