    "magnetars are thought to be neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "further work by @xcite theorized how the decay of the strong magnetic fields in magnetars can produce soft gamma - ray and x - ray emission and proposed that anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) could indeed be magnetars .",
    "this identification of axps and sgrs as magnetars was validated when pulsations with spin - down ( a typical characteristic of pulsars ) were first detected from one of these objects @xcite . at the time of writing",
    ", 23 magnetars have been discovered ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and only four have conclusively shown pulsed radio emission @xcite .",
    "sgr  j1745@xmath02900 , the subject of this work , is the last one discovered , and is a compelling object due to its proximity to sagittarius a * ( sgr@xmath9a * ) , the supermassive black hole candidate in the galactic centre ( gc )",
    ". initially discovered at high energies @xcite , pulsations in the radio band up to @xmath10 were also detected with different radio telescopes @xcite .",
    "one peculiar characteristic of radio - loud magnetars is that they tend to show shallower spectral indices than ordinary pulsars .",
    "this property makes magnetars unique sources to obtain pulsar observations at high radio frequencies , where ordinary pulsars are , with a few exceptions @xcite , usually too faint to be detected and studied .",
    "this underexplored region of the spectrum of emission is valuable in the study of pulsar emission physics .",
    "for instance some emission models include effects that may only be detectable at high radio frequencies , like `` coherence breakdown '' between the radio and infrared bands where an incoherent component of emission becomes dominant @xcite .",
    "additionally , unexpected effects have been seen in some of the high frequency pulsar observations available to date : spectral flattening @xcite , variability in flux density @xcite or changes in polarization degree @xcite .",
    "this particular source lies in the vicinity of sgr@xmath9a*. it has been shown that pulsars closely orbiting the black hole could be used to test general relativity and alternative theories of gravity to the highest precision @xcite . because the scattering towards the gc remains not well understood @xcite , and scattering may still limit our chances of finding pulsars in the gc , sgr  j1745@xmath02900 is therefore a useful target for tests of high - frequency observations of the gc .",
    "we present here observations of the magnetar sgr  j1745@xmath02900 from 2.54 to @xmath4 .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and data reduction .",
    "our results are presented in section 3 .",
    "finally , a summary and discussion are given in section 4 .",
    "_ nanay and effelsberg : _ at the nanay radio telescope , observations were taken at a central frequency of @xmath11 with a bandwidth of @xmath12 .",
    "data from dual linear polarizations were coherently dedispersed , folded modulo the magnetar period and recorded to disc .",
    "the observations were flux density calibrated using the standard psrchive software routines that require the use of a calibrated noise diode in combination with observations of a calibration source ; in this case 3c286 was used .",
    "observations at 4.85 and @xmath13 were made at the effelsberg@xmath9100-m radio telescope using both a digital spectrometer , operating in a pulsar search mode , and a coherent dedispersion system . at each frequency",
    "dual circular polarizations were recorded over a total bandwidth of @xmath14 .",
    "a calibrated noise diode was used to determine the flux density scale by comparing it to ngc7027 .",
    "data were processed with the sigproc software package .    _ _ : observations in the millimetre band were made at the radio telescope and used the eight mixer receiver ( emir , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the broad - band - continuum ( bbc ) backend .",
    "the bbc is connected to four outputs of emir working with dual frequency bands and dual sideband mixers .",
    "two frequency combinations were used : centred at 87 , 101 , 138 , 154 ghz ( mode e0/e1 ) and 87 , 101 , 209 , 225 ghz ( mode e0/e2 ) .",
    "the effective bandwidth of the bbc is estimated to be 24 ghz ( 6 ghz per frequency band ) .",
    "both horizontal ( h ) and vertical ( v ) linear polarizations were recorded .",
    "we noted a systematic lower sensitivity in the h polarization channel , the cause of which we were not able to identify . a special set - up of the backend enabled fast time sampling of the continuum signal at @xmath15 .",
    "the total variations of the system temperature ( @xmath16 ) during the four days were between 77@xmath0183@xmath17 for the @xmath18 band , 84@xmath0208@xmath17 for the @xmath19 band , 87@xmath0257@xmath17 for @xmath20 band , 98@xmath0327@xmath17 for the @xmath3 band , 478@xmath0571@xmath17 for the @xmath21 band and 520@xmath0621@xmath17 for the @xmath2 band .",
    "temporal fluctuations in the atmospheric water vapour are responsible for the high variations of @xmath16 .",
    "we observed in `` total power '' mode , i.e. always on source .",
    "this observing mode has the disadvantage that atmospheric and receiver gain variations are reflected in the data as variations of the mean count level .",
    "self - produced instrumental interference was present in the data , in particular at harmonics of @xmath22 , most likely produced by the cryogenerator .",
    "the data reduction was as follows . the dispersion delay due to the interstellar medium , even at the large @xmath23 of the source , is only @xmath24 across the observing frequency range .",
    "this delay is smaller than the sampling time of @xmath15 and therefore negligible .",
    "the variations in the time series and interference needed to be removed because they contaminated significantly the baseline of the folded pulsar profile , reducing our sensitivity to the pulsed emission .",
    "our solution consisted of using a sliding window of width @xmath25 where a sine wave of @xmath22 and baseline were fit to the data , subtracting the central @xmath26 of the fit from the raw data .",
    "this reduced the variations enough to produce a nearly flat - baseline folded profile . for 209 and 225ghz ,",
    "this method was less effective than a running mean filtering , that was applied twice to the time series with windows of 10 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "both filtering methods subtract the continuum emission contribution from the gc .",
    "finally , the cleaned time series were folded with the topocentric period of sgr  j1745@xmath02900 , calculated from a recent ephemeris from a timing analysis performed at lower frequencies .",
    "the flux density calculations were done using interspersed hot - cold load calibration measurements at the beginning and end of each observation scan , providing the required quantities to convert counts to antenna temperature ta*. the methodology follows @xcite . the conversion factor from ta * to flux density @xmath28",
    "was obtained from the observatory efficiency tables .",
    "pointing corrections were also applied between scans .",
    "in addition , due to the low telescope elevations during the observations , an elevation - dependent telescope - gain correction was applied @xcite .",
    "our flux density calibration method was verified with pointings on the planets mars and uranus .    _ apex _ : additional millimetre and submillimetre data were taken with the apex radio telescope .",
    "the system used was the flash@xmath29 receiver with a special version of the continuum pocket backend ( pbe ) .",
    "flash@xmath29 worked in dual sideband mode providing simultaneously four bands centred at 296 , 308 , 460 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the total bandwidth was 16 ghz ( 4 ghz per frequency band ) , splitting and recording one polarization at 296 and @xmath30 and the other at 460 and @xmath4 .",
    "the sampling time of the continuum signal was @xmath31 .",
    "sgr  j1745@xmath02900 was observed on 2014 august 24 for @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath16 varied during the observation between 119@xmath0130@xmath17 for the @xmath33 band , 129@xmath0143@xmath17 for the @xmath30 band , 589@xmath0811@xmath17 for the @xmath34 band , and 471@xmath03414@xmath17 for the @xmath4 band .",
    "the atmospheric water vapour content is responsible for the high @xmath16 at 460 and @xmath4 .",
    "again , `` total power '' measurements were done .",
    "we applied the two - running - mean method with 10 and @xmath27 windows to reduce the variations in the time series and subtract the continuum contributions of the atmosphere and gc .",
    "the cleaned time series were then folded using the topocentric period of sgr  j1745@xmath02900 computed from our ephemeris . for the non - detection flux density limits , the radiometer equation with a signal - to - noise threshold of 5 ,",
    "duty cycle of 0.075 , and telescope gain from the observatory efficiency tables is used ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "factors to account for the transmissivity of the atmosphere are also included .    within the constraints of the source visibility",

    "the polarization splitting of the apex receiver ( see  2 ) , if the magnetar is highly linearly polarized at these frequencies , could have also led to a loss in sensitivity if the radiation was misaligned with the feed at the lower bands , 296 and @xmath30 , that were much more sensitive .",
    "because of these uncertainties , we can not conclusively rule out the emission of sgr  j1745@xmath02900 between 296 and @xmath4 , nor a lack of it .",
    "the detections of sgr  j1745@xmath02900 up to @xmath2 and its single pulses up to @xmath3 set new records for the detection of pulsed emission from a neutron star in the radio band .",
    "the high measured flux density of sgr  j1745@xmath02900 at the millimetre band between 87 and @xmath2 , @xmath89 , and the numerous strong single - pulses detected up to @xmath3 show that sgr  j1745@xmath02900 can be , at least during some periods of activity , an efficient producer of radiation at very high radio frequencies . in combination with the work by @xcite",
    ", our detections suggest that emission at very high radio frequencies from radio - loud magnetars might be a frequent characteristic of these objects .",
    "the origin of the radio emission from magnetars is still unclear .",
    "the case of magnetars is perhaps more complex than for ordinary pulsars , which are thought to be powered entirely by their loss of rotational kinetic energy , ( also called `` spin - down luminosity '' ) @xmath90 .",
    "some magnetars show luminosities at high energies that are much larger than @xmath90 ( see , e.g. , tables  2 and 7 in * ? ? ?",

    "is required .",

    ". therefore , @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "this shows that the radio emission could be powered by its rotational kinetic energy ; although this does not mean that this is the source or rule out that other mechanisms are involved .",
    "sgr  j1745@xmath02900 shows common characteristics with ordinary pulsars , and remarkable differences , like it is for the other three known radio magnetars @xcite .",
    "the reason for this , as well as the details of the radio emission from pulsars in general , is still unknown .",
    "finally , the detection of sgr  j1745@xmath02900 up to 225@xmath9ghz at a distance of 8.3@xmath9kpc shows that it is , in principle , possible to search for pulsars in the gc at these frequencies .",
    "a key advantage of pulsar searches at millimetre wavelengths is that any deleterious effects caused by the gc interstellar medium ( i.e. pulse scattering and dispersion ) can be fully neglected . along the same lines , any deleterious effects caused by the intergalactic medium , which are not well known ,",
    "could also be neglected or will have a minimal impact .",
    "it might therefore also be an option to search for shallow - spectrum pulsars in nearby galaxies through single - pulse emission . at 1.4@xmath9ghz",
    ", the magnetar is more luminous than 97 per cent of all known pulsars , and it is by far the most luminous in the millimetre band .",
    "this fact alone suggests a larger less - luminous population that can be detected with increased sensitivity at the millimetre band . in any case",
    ", pulsar searches with more sensitive millimetre telescopes , such as alma , are promising .",
