    "the development of a new generation of time - dependent mean - field codes @xcite , which are able to perform symmetry unrestricted large amplitude nuclear motion , with eventually superfluid effects , is an important step towards a unified microscopic description of the many facets of nuclear dynamics .",
    "these approaches have recently been applied to describe a variety of phenomena , such as collective motion @xcite , fusion and transfer reactions @xcite , or fission @xcite .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory is particularly suitable when quantum aspects of single - particles are important , and the internal excitation of the system is not too high .",
    "for this reason , it appears adequate for nuclear reactions close to the coulomb barrier where fusion and transfer reactions compete .",
    "the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) and tdhf+bcs theories have been used for instance to study dynamical effects on the fusion barriers @xcite or dissipative transport coefficients @xcite . by using projection techniques borrowed from nuclear structure studies",
    ", it was also possible to extract the transfer probabilities for 1 neutron ( 1 proton ) , 2 neutrons ( 2 protons ) , ... channels and to analyze possible effects of superfluidity @xcite . due to nucleon exchange",
    ", the transfer process also induces a global dissipation of the energy leading to an energy loss between the entrance and exit channels .",
    "the time - dependent mean - field theory gives access , for a given impact parameter and beam energy , to the energy loss averaged over the different transfer channels .",
    "this energy loss is a priori properly described because tdhf correctly includes the one - body dissipation effects associated to deformation and nucleon exchange processes @xcite .",
    "detailed measurements of @xmath0u+@xmath1c transfer reactions have been performed at ganil @xcite .",
    "data on the excitation of the transfer products have been individually obtained for each transfer channel , and the dependence with the center - of - mass energy has been experimentally investigated .",
    "these findings , which bring an experimental probe of the transfer mechanism , have largely motivated the present work . the possibility to get",
    "any observable channel  by  channel from a mean - field theory is a particularly interesting and challenging problem . indeed ,",
    "tdhf or its extensions , can be seen as an average over the different channels .",
    "therefore , the possibility to trace - back individual probabilities instead of the average is to be clarified .",
    "one recent example where this was possible concerns the determination of transfer probabilities .",
    "the use of the projection operator technique @xcite gives access to the individual probability of each channel . in the present article , which uses this technique as starting point",
    ", we propose a method to get the excitation energy distribution of each channel .",
    "we describe here the reaction @xmath0u+@xmath1c at 6.14 mev / a .",
    "the @xmath0u is superfluid and deformed in its ground state . to describe this reaction",
    ", we use the recently developed tdhf3d+bcs @xcite model .",
    "the pairing correlation is taken into account during the initialization of the two nuclei with the bcs approach .",
    "the skyrme force sly4d @xcite is used , with a surface pairing interaction @xcite . during the collision ,",
    "the occupation numbers are assumed to be constant ( frozen occupation approximation @xcite ) .",
    "calculations are done in a spatial grid of @xmath2 @xmath3 with a lattice spacing @xmath4 fm and a time step 0.5 fm / c . following recent applications of tdhf to transfer @xcite and in order to reduce the computational time , all the calculations are done at zero impact parameter , denoted by @xmath5 hereafter .",
    "the impact parameter influence is then taken into account in an effective way by using an impact parameter dependent center of mass energy , @xmath6 this formula is obtained by supposing that the fictitious zero impact parameter trajectory has the same minimal distance of approach as the rutherford trajectory for the impact parameter @xmath5 and center of mass energy @xmath7 considered .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to assume that the transfer probabilities mainly depend on the distance of closest approach @xcite .",
    "the evolution will also depend on the angle @xmath8 between the collision axis and the orientation of the @xmath0u .",
    "for each energy , two tdhf+bcs calculations are performed , at @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "examples of mean - field evolutions for energies slightly below the coulomb barrier are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : film ] .",
    "we can see that the uranium is deformed in its ground state .",
    "we found a deformation parameter @xmath11 .",
    "note that , due to deformation , the fusion barrier also depends on the orientation . by using the same method as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamical barriers are estimated to be 57.6 mev and 63.9 mev , for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .     in the center of mass at different times for the collision @xmath0u on @xmath1c .",
    "the results showed on the left- and right - side plots correspond to the perpendicular ( @xmath10 ) and parallel ( @xmath9 ) orientations respectively .",
    "the center of mass energies are @xmath12 mev ( for @xmath10 ) and @xmath13 ( for @xmath9 ) . ]    for each energy @xmath14 , i.e. each impact parameter , the energy loss between the entrance and the exit channel is computed .",
    "note that during the reaction time , few light particles might be emitted . here",
    ", we neglect the energy that might be released by emission and simply assume that the energy loss is entirely converted into internal excitation of the fragments . the excitation energy determined with this method",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exc ] as a function of the center of mass energy @xmath15 .",
    "the change of orientation shifts the function by about 6 mev .",
    "this result is expected since the excitation comes mainly from the contact between the two fragments .",
    "the energy at which this contact occurs is lower for the parallel orientation than for the perpendicular one .",
    "blue crosses and dots correspond to a perpendicular and parallel orientations of the uranium , respectively . in both cases",

    "the latter is the dynamical fusion barrier .",
    "a second important quantity that can be extracted from the tdhf+bcs evolution is the transfer probability for different channels .",
    "after the collision , the probability to have @xmath21 neutrons and @xmath22 protons in one of the sides of the lattice is computed with the projection method described in ref .",

    "calculations are done for 3 different center of mass energies : @xmath28 -0.1 mev / a ( green triangles ) , -0.4 mev / a ( blue dots ) and -1.4 mev / a ( red crosses ) . ]    a systematic illustration of the probability distributions for the two considered orientations is given as a function of the center of mass energy for the @xmath29be channel in fig .",

    "the pure transfer probabilities can be well reproduced by the formula , @xmath31 the values of the @xmath32 parameters , which were obtained by fitting the calculated transfer probabilities , are reported in table [ tab : exp_exc ] , for the different channels discussed below and the two considered orientations .",

    "the values of the @xmath33 parameters are given in mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the parameterization of the excitation energy given above and the transfer probabilities and following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can now determine the transfer cross section as a function of the excitation energy @xmath34 , @xmath35 eq .   together with eq . gives a bijection between the impact parameter and the excitation energy .",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain the impact parameter @xmath36 as a function of the excitation energy @xmath34 for a given center of mass energy and a given orientation of the heavy nucleus .",
    "one drawback of the time - dependent mean - field approach is that it does not describe properly the possible competition between transfer channels and fusion .",
    "indeed , for energies above the fusion barrier , the mean - field evolution always leads to fusion while , for energies below , only transfer channels are populated .",
    "this limitation stems from the semiclassical nature of the mean - field dynamics in collective space .",
    "experimentally , both reaction mechanisms coexist in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier . in the experiment performed at ganil , only transfer reactions leading to fission",
    "have been detected .",
    "the details of the experiment can be found in ref @xcite . in order to compare with experimental observations",
    ", one should start from the calculated pure transfer probabilities @xmath37 and account for : ( i ) the competition with fusion channel , and ( ii ) the fact that , even if transfer occurs , it does not automatically lead to the fission of the heavy fragment .",

    "the fluctuation of the barrier height is assumed to be @xmath39=0.5 mev .",
    "note that the fusion probabilities for all possible orientations are necessary .",
    "a method will be discussed below that smoothly interpolates between a parallel and a perpendicular orientation of the heavy nucleus .    for the fission probability",
    ", we took advantage of the experimental results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig . [",

    "results of the this parametrization is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pf_240pu ] with solid line .",
    "note that different transfer channels lead to different heavy systems that might eventually fission . for simplicity",
    ", we assume here that all these heavy systems have a fission probability equal to the one measured for @xmath48pu . the impact of this approximation has been investigated through specific calculations , which took into account the different fission probability of each system .",
    "the results , which only showed minor effects , justified such a simplification .",
    "having now phenomenological prescriptions for the fusion and fission probabilities , we can deduce the transfer - induced fission probability .",
    "this probability is calculated as the pure transfer cross - section convoluted by the probabilities that no fusion occurred and that the heavy system did fission .",

    "[ fig : aver_all_comp_shift_bar ] .",
    "while the tdhf+bcs results are in relatively good agreement with the data at high center of mass energies , a systematic overestimation is seen in the low energy regions .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy is the difference between the barrier height obtained by tdhf+bcs ( 62 mev ) and the experimental one ( 65 mev ) .",
    "this difference is most probably due to the poor treatment of light systems like @xmath1c in the mean - field approach . in order to correct for this systematic error ,",
    "we have artificially shifted the average excitation energy used in the cross - section calculation with tdhf by 3 mev , i.e @xmath64 with this correction , the general behavior of the average excitation energy as a function of the center of mass energy is in better agreement with the experimental results . in particular , for the @xmath29be channel .",

    "@xcite which was originally designed for heavy - ion reactions around the fermi energy , and it is able to describe a variety of reaction mechanisms including secondary decay leading eventually to fission .",
    "the main ingredient of this approach is the exploration of all the accessible phase - space configurations at the minimal distance of approach , accounting for all the energetic and geometric constraints .",
    "@xcite for further details . due to the semi - classical treatment of the incoming nuclei ,",
    "it could only be used above the fusion barrier and therefore it can be seen as a complementary study compared to tdhf+bcs .",
    "a set of events has been generated with hipse for several beam energies : @xmath65 mev / a , @xmath66 mev / a , @xmath67 mev / a , @xmath68 mev / a and @xmath69 mev / a . in each case",
    ", @xmath70 events have been generated with impact parameters ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath71 fm .",
    "note that above 4 fm , the two nuclei do not touch each other due to the high charge of the uranium beam .",
    "the different simulations have been performed using an adiabatic parameter equal to -0.13 and a transfer rate equal to @xmath72 while it is assumed that no direct two - body collisions occurs due to the pauli blocking effect .",
    "note that changing slightly the two former parameters does not affect the result .",
    "one advantage of the hipse model is that it gives access to the fragment partition as well as their internal excitation before decay . using this information ,",
    "we have estimated the average excitation energy of the heavy fragment before secondary decay for the different channels populated in the experiments of refs .",
    "results are shown by orange triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : aver_all_comp_shift_bar ] .",
    "when no results are shown , it means that the channel was not populated by hipse .",
    "note that , this model being optimized at higher beam energies , it is not expected to be predictive for the transfer cross - sections .",
    "however , we see that , when the channel is observed in hipse , the average excitation energy is rather close from both the experimental and tdhf+bcs estimates .",
    "this gives further confidence in the values obtained here using the microscopic mean - field approach .",
    "in the present work , a method is proposed to determine the evolution of the excitation energy as a function of the center of mass energy with the tdhf+bcs theory .",
    "all the calculations being done by assuming a head - on collision , a method is used in order to effectively take into account the impact parameter effects .",
    "the deformation is taken into account via an interpolation method between the perpendicular and parallel orientations of the heavy nucleus . to make contact with experiments ,",
    "several ingredients should be taken into account .",
    "in particular , the fusion as well as the fission probabilities should be used to transform the pure transfer probabilities obtained with our microscopic theory into a transfer  fission probability that was measured experimentally .",
    "it is shown that the microscopic theory slightly overestimates the experimental excitation energy at low center of mass energy ( most peripheral collisions ) while at higher excitation energy , a good agreement is obtained .",
    "this discrepancy can be traced back in the poor treatment of very light systems like @xmath1c in the mean - field approach .",
    "once this aspect is corrected , the experimental results for the reaction @xmath0u+@xmath1c compares rather well with tdhf+bcs calculations .",
    "in particular , the evolution of the excitation energy as a function of the center of mass for the main channel . the mean - field and experimental values of excitation energy at high center of mass energy",
    "are also consistent with the hipse results .",
    "while the time - dependent mean - field approach does a priori give average information on the nuclear reaction , the present work further confirms that the mean - field theory can be also helpful to extract chemical or energetic information on transfer reaction channel  by  channel . for future applications , calculations taking into account",
    "explicitly the impact parameter @xcite could be done in order to improve the results .",
