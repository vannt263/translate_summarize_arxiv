    "the modern idea of gravitation , at least in its classical description , is based upon the postulates of metric theories @xcite , which embody the so  called weak equivalence principle ( wep ) .",
    "this principle postulates : _ if an uncharged test body is placed at an initial event of space  time and given an initial velocity , then its subsequent trajectory will be independent of its internal structure and composition _ @xcite .",
    "this principle has its experimental foundation in the universality of free fall , an experiment first performed by galileo @xcite , and it entails a relation between two different concepts of mass , i.e. , inertial mass ( @xmath0 ) and passive gravitational mass ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "indeed , the classical equation of motion for a point  like particle immersed in a homogeneous gravitational field ( along the @xmath2axis ) reads    @xmath3    wep states that the solution to this equation depends upon initial conditions , but not on the internal structure of the considered particle . in other words , it is based upon the fact that    @xmath4    is a universal constant , i.e. , the same for all particles .    at this point",
    "two remarks have to be done .",
    "firstly , wep requires as a necessary condition a particle  independent value of @xmath5 . in other words ,",
    "the particular value of @xmath5 is completely irrelevant .",
    "this may be understood if we introduce ( [ wepcla2 ] ) into the motion equation    @xmath6    here @xmath7 .",
    "a value of @xmath8 would entail a redefinition of the acceleration of gravity . in an experiment we can not detect @xmath9 or @xmath5 ,",
    "only the _ effective _ acceleration of gravity , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "this proves that the value of @xmath5 ( assuming the validity of wep ) is irrelevant , it can not be measured .",
    "secondly , the geometrization of gravity requires wep . in other words , if @xmath5 is particle  dependent , then wep breaks down and therefore the geometrization of gravity would be a dubious issue , at least with a four  dimensional manifold . finally , let us add that any experimental test of the validity , or invalidity , of wep requires the use of more than one particle . indeed ,",
    "wep is based upon the universal character of @xmath5 and one particle can not provide us this kind of information .",
    "the mathematical version of wep is done stating : _ the motion of an uncharged particle is provided by the geodesics of the corresponding manifold _",
    "notice that behind this phrase lies the concept of trajectory .",
    "the experimental verification of wep in the classical level has been done in different approaches and devices @xcite but the quantum  mechanical version demands a careful analysis .",
    "this last remark acquires relevance since in quantum theory the concept of trajectory is not a necessary one , i.e. , the theory can be formulated without it @xcite .",
    "we may cast this last idea in the following manner : is it conceptually correct to formulate wep in the validity region of quantum theory in terms of a concept which happens to be not a fundamental one in quantum theory ?",
    "this last comment leads us to the main question in the present work . indeed , since wep is formulated in terms of trajectories and quantum mechanics does not contain this notion as a central one , how could we formulate wep in terms of ideas fundamental in quantum theory ?",
    "the present work puts forward a definition in this sense .",
    "this will be done resorting to the idea of interference pattern , which is a wave  like property .",
    "the first experiments ( usually denoted by cow ) showing how gravity appears in the realm of quantum theory can be considered to begin in 1974 @xcite . the phenomenon dealt with in this series of experiments",
    "can be denoted a gravity  induced quantum interference .",
    "they embody an interference pattern of thermal neutrons induced by gravity .",
    "a brief description of this experiment is the following one @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use an almost monoenergetic beam of thermal neutrons .",
    "this last statement means a kinetic energy of about 20 mev , which is tantamount to a speed of @xmath10 .",
    "the primary beam is split into two parts , such that each one of the new beams travels along different paths .",
    "these paths define a parallelogram of sides @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "if these two paths lie in a horizontal plane , then , there is vanishing relative phase shift between the two beams .",
    "if we now rotate the plane , say an angle @xmath13 around any of its arms , then a non  vanishing relative phase shift appears , due to the fact that the paths , these secondary beams follow , are located at heights associated with different gravitational potential .",
    "it can be shown that the phase difference between the two secondary beams , @xmath14 , has the following form @xcite    @xmath15    in this last expression @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the mass of the neutrons and the de broglie wavelength of the neutrons , respectively .",
    "notice that in all these experiments no distinction is introduced between inertial and passive gravitational mass @xcite .",
    "the dependence of ( [ atomic3 ] ) on the mass of the involved particles has originated a hot debate about the possible presence of a non  geometric element of gravity at the quantum realm , and in consequence the claim of a violation of wep has been put forward @xcite .",
    "this ambiguity of cow in relation with wep appears even in some texts books on quantum mechanics , see , for instance , the last paragraph and footnote on page 129 in @xcite .    of course",
    ", we may find in the literature the opposite position .",
    "for instance , already in the abstract of @xcite we may find the following phrase : _ we show that the cow experiment respects the equivalence principle_. this work @xcite is an interesting one and sheds light upon some similarities between the classical and quantal versions of the experiment .",
    "other results within the context of neutron interferometry address different issues related to this experiment .",
    "for instance , the influence of spacetime torsion upon these experiments has already been analyzed @xcite , as well as the general relativistic description of them @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these works do not tackle the relation between the mass dependency of the phase shift and wep . as a matter of fact",
    ", a fleeting glance at these works allows us to confirm that none of them establishes a distinction between inertial and passive gravitational mass . in other words ,",
    "they take by granted wep .    concerning this debate around the validity of wep in the context of quantum theory",
    "we will take no sides .",
    "the appearance of mass in expression ( [ atomic3 ] ) seems to the authors neither enough to state that wep is violate , nor fulfilled .",
    "the situation calls for some new solution that could lead to the disentanglement of the problem .",
    "our contribution lies along this direction .",
    "one possibility has already been considered , at least theoretically , i.e. , free fall of quantum particles , with and without classical analogue @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out the use of this idea seems to imply a redefinition of wep for quantum theory since no quantum object can reproduce the classical concept of deterministic trajectory and the macroscopic version of wep is formulated in terms of trajectories @xcite .",
    "the present proposal is a slight generalization of cow , in order to consider the possibility of testing directly a quantal version for wep .",
    "this definition does not require the concept of trajectory and relies upon the phase shift induced by a gravitational field in the context of a quantum interference experiment of two coherent beams of particles , i.e. , it resorts to wavelike properties .",
    "additionally , an experimental proposal designed to test it is also here put forward .",
    "we will address the issue from its most fundamental aspect .",
    "firstly , as mentioned in the introduction wep is based upon the fact that @xmath18 is particle independent .",
    "this condition implies the universality of free fall .",
    "secondly , quantum mechanics does not require the concept of trajectories .",
    "in other words , a quantal version of wep based upon the idea of trajectory seems conceptually a mistake .",
    "hence , the problem we face is to define in a consistent way the meaning of wep .",
    "a possibility is to define wep operationally as follows .",
    "let us re - write the phase shift introducing from square one the distinction between inertial and passive gravitational masses .",
    "then we obtain    @xmath19    introducing @xmath20 we have    @xmath21    this expression allows us to put forward a quantal wep definition .",
    "indeed , a fleeting glance at ( [ atomic5 ] ) shows us that now we may distinguish between different particles , in the sense that @xmath5 could be particle  dependent .",
    "the usual expression , see ( [ atomic3 ] ) , assumes that @xmath22 for all particles , and in consequence assumes from the very beginning the validity of wep .",
    "* definition * : let us consider a cow device , i.e. , the geometry of it is already given .",
    "this means @xmath11 , @xmath12 the lengths of the arms , and the tilt angle @xmath13 are fixed parameters , and also @xmath9 .",
    "wep in the quantum realm means that    @xmath23    is a universal a parameter , i.e. , independent of the mass of the employed particles . before proceeding let us mention that this definition is motivated by two factors",
    "firstly , as mentioned before the core behind the classical wep is encoded in a universal value for @xmath5 , and in this sense our definition embodies the most substantial factor involved in the macroscopic version of this principle .",
    "in other words , our definition encompasses the main ingredient behind the macroscopic version of wep .",
    "secondly , the idea is to have a feasible experimental verification of it . since our principle resorts",
    "to cow we need a slight generalization of it to have a possibility to falsify our definition .      at our disposal , as experimental parameters , we have the arms length of the interferometer , the wavelength of the particle , and the tilt angle .",
    "this remark entails us to introduce three different variations of the same kind of experiment .",
    "the first series of experiments modifies only the wavelength of the particle . with our arm lengths @xmath11 and @xmath12 and a certain non  vanishing tilt angle @xmath13 we tune the velocity of our first type of particles ( whose inertial mass will be denoted by @xmath24 ) .",
    "hence , since momentum and wavelength satisfy de broglie s relation , i.e. , @xmath25 , ( [ atomic5 ] ) becomes    @xmath26    here @xmath27 takes into account the possible particle  dependence of this parameter .",
    "suppose now that we perform our experiment in such a way that our first case for the velocity , @xmath28 , provides a constructive interference pattern , hence @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an integer .",
    "our second experiment employs a velocity , @xmath31 , such that it provides the nearest destructive interference pattern to the first experiment ( there are two velocities , one above @xmath28 and one below it fulfilling this condition )",
    ". then we have the following two expressions    @xmath32    @xmath33 = \\frac{m^{(1)}_{(i)}gl_1l_2\\sin(\\theta)}{\\hbar v_{(2)}}\\label{atomic9}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with them we obtain    @xmath34 ^ 2}\\label{atomic10}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now carry out the same experiment with a different kind of particles ( @xmath35 ) and obtain    @xmath36",
    "^ 2}\\label{atomic11}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the corresponding velocities , which do not need to be equal to @xmath31 and @xmath28 .",
    "notice that in this way we may deduce the value of @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "we may now put forward an experimental proposal for testing the just introduced quantal wep definition .",
    "let us assume that we perform several times , resorting to different kind of particles , this experiment .",
    "according to our definition @xmath5 has to be particle ",
    "independent , hence , if wep is to be fulfilled , then for different particles the same value for @xmath5 shall emerge .",
    "more than one value would imply the breakdown of wep .      if the tuning up of the velocity becomes a nuisance , then the possibility of having several samples of the silicon crystal interferometer could be exploited , and in this way we obtain an expression tantamount to @xmath41 .",
    "one of the arms , say @xmath11 takes to different values .",
    "from now on we write for these two values @xmath42 , where , @xmath43 .",
    "this means that in this situation we have ( here the velocity @xmath44 is the same for both experiments )    @xmath45    clearly , in this manner we may compare the value of @xmath5 for different type of particles .",
    "the third possibility could be the easiest to handle .",
    "it encompasses different values for the acceleration of gravity .",
    "this does not mean , necessarily , the use of satellites , though this is also an additional possibility . a fleeting glance to @xmath46 shows us that in cow we have an _ effective acceleration of gravity _",
    "given by    @xmath47    then we may _ change the effective acceleration of gravity _ with @xmath13 .",
    "this means that now we have two different values for our effective acceleration @xmath48 , @xmath49 such that    @xmath50    once again we may use our derived expression with different kind of particles and test our quantal wep definition .    we may wonder what information could be elicited from @xcite in connection with the present model .",
    "figure 2 on page 1473 allows us to estimate ( using expression ( 2 ) on 1472 ) in a rough way the value of @xmath5 for neutrons .",
    "indeed , consider the first maximum and minimum to the right of @xmath51 .",
    "the angle , in degrees , of the crest is , approximately , 2 , while the valley is around 5 degrees .",
    "the experimental parameters are all given except the value of the acceleration of gravity , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "taking a value of @xmath52 we obtain @xmath53 for the case depicted in @xcite . comparing against the result obtained in @xcite ( @xmath54",
    "$ ] ) we conclude that our rough procedure provides a reasonable value for @xmath5 .",
    "a simple definition for a quantal wep version has been put forward , the one does not require the concept of trajectory and that also includes for macroscopic bodies the main element behind this principle .",
    "our proposal is connected with the phase shift appearing in cow and measures a possible particle dependency in the relation inertial mass  passive gravitational mass .",
    "three different experiments have been also mentioned .",
    "finally , let us address an additional issue which has to be contemplated in the context of the feasibility of the present proposal . as underlined before ,",
    "different kinds of particles are required in order to test wep , i.e. , neutron interferometry does not suffice .",
    "therefore , we must mention some other systems that could be employed in a interference experiment of this sort .",
    "the first atomic interferometry experiment is already an old experiment @xcite , though in this case it is a young type  like device , i.e. , it measures space coherence , and not time coherence as in a cow experiment , which can be catalogued as a mach ",
    "zehnder situation @xcite .",
    "additional results may already be found in the extant literature @xcite .",
    "these last works prove that atomic and even molecular interferometry are already a real possibility .",
    "these devices introduce different sort of particles , a factor which is the key element in our work . in other words",
    ", we may contemplate the possibility of resorting to atomic interferometry in the detection of gravity  induced phase shifts .",
    "of course , this requires additional work , and at this point it defines an experimental problem .    finally , modern elementary particle theories regard , for instance , the neutron as a system embodying more than one elementary particle called quarks @xcite . in our experiment",
    "we do not take into account this structure .",
    "the reason for it is quite simple , namely , the quark confinement hypothesis , i.e. , free quarks are never seen in isolation .",
    "indeed , the quark confinement hypothesis , which can be understood as an implication of the asymptotic freedom , tells us that the force between two quarks increases at lower energies as they are separated more and more from one another .",
    "in other words , it seems that a possible detection of the quarks , defining a neutron , by cow could imply a violation of the quark confinement hypothesis .",
