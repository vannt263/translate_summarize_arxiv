    "solar prominences are seen as bright translucent clouds at @xmath010 mm over the solar limb because they mainly scatter light from the underlying disk . when seen on the solar disk",
    ", they appear as dark , long filamentary structures , hence called filaments .",
    "the main body of the filament ( spine ) often has shorter side - wards extensions ( filament barbs ) which , when seen at the limb , give the impression of extending from the spine to the photosphere below ( prominence feet ) @xcite .",
    "it has long been clear that a magnetic field supports the dense material of prominences against gravity and prevents them from dissipating into the faint , extremely hot corona .",
    "local dips on magnetic field lines can support the plasma , and could be induced by the dense , heavy prominence plasma itself @xcite , or they can exist in force - free @xcite or stochastic magnetic fields @xcite . yet , all these theoretical claims must be constrained by the empirical determination of magnetic fields in prominences .    in the sun , and in any astrophysical plasma in general , we are not able to directly measure these fields , but we are obliged to infer them from the light they emit .",
    "spectro - polarimetry , the measurement of the polarized spectrum of light allows us to recover _ quantitative _ information on the magnetic field vector .",
    "the polarization state of observed light is compatible with the intrinsic ( broken ) symmetries of the emitting plasma , in particular , with the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "thus , for example , the emission by an isotropic ( and therefore unmagnetized ) medium is unpolarized",
    ". polarized emission along a magnetic field is circularly polarized while , normally to the field , it is linearly polarized , as in the longitudinal or transversal zeeman effects , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if light is scattered , additional symmetries are broken and the dependencies of polarization are more involved . in solar prominences and filaments , spectral lines are polarized by scattering and the zeeman effect , and futher modified by the hanle effect @xcite , providing direct information on the magnetic field vector .",
    "many studies have observed prominences with the aim to determine magnetic fields .",
    "some maps of the magnetic field vector in quiescent prominences show horizontal magnetic fields of @xmath1 g @xcite , in agreement with results obtained in the 1970 s and 1980 s from observations with limited spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "in contrast , vertical fields have been also diagnosed in prominences @xcite .",
    "considering prominence feet , the observation of vertical velocities in these structures suggest vertical fields directly connecting the spine with the photosphere @xcite .",
    "also , from observations of photospheric magnetic fields ( not the prominence itself ) , the barbs are interpreted as a series of local horizontal dips sustaining plasma at different heights @xcite .    in the light of these results",
    "it is clear that , from the observational point of view , the precise topology of magnetic fields in prominences is still a matter of debate .",
    "the main reasons are that 1 ) measuring the polarized spectrum of solar prominences is an observational challenge , and 2 ) the inference of the magnetic field vector in the hanle regime is subject to potential ambiguities . in this paper , we reconstruct the topology of the feet of a quiescent prominence from spectro - polarimetric data at the hei 1083.0 nm line .",
    "we study the possible solutions to the inverse problem and , in contrast to previous results , we discard some of them using a physical constraint .",
    "we also propose an analytical method to be used to find the multiple solutions in the case of hanle diagnostics in prominences and write the explicit equations in the appendix .",
    "on april 24 2011 ( 10:00 - 13:00 ut ) , we performed four consecutive spectro - polarimetric scans of a quiescent prominence ( located at 90e 42s ) focusing at the 1083.0  nm multiplet using the tenerife infrared polarimeter @xcite at the german vacuum tower telescope in the observatorio del teide .",
    "we integrated 30 s per scan step to reach a polarimetric sensitivity of 7@xmath2 10@xmath3 times the maximum intensity .",
    "each scan of the prominenece took around 30 min .",
    "this data set constitute a unique time series of high polarimetric sensitivity and unprecedented spatial resolution ( @xmath4 km on the sun ) of a prominence .",
    "we applied standard reduction procedures to the raw spectra ( bias and flat - field correction , and polarization demodulation ) to obtain maps of the four stokes parameters i , q , u , and v ( fig .",
    "the slit was always kept across the solar limb ( horizontal direction in the images ) , which allowed us to correct for seeing - induced cross - talk and stray light @xcite .",
    "the seeing conditions were excellent , the adaptive optics system often reaching an apparent mirror diameter of 20 cm .",
    "this made the applied seeing - induced corrections to be very small , i.e. , close to the limb , where the effects of seeing are expected to be the largest , the average corrections applied were @xmath5 10@xmath6 times the maximum intensity .",
    "simultaneous images were taken with a narrow - band lyot filter centered at the core of the h@xmath7 line with a cadence of 1 s. these images were treated with blind deconvolution techniques @xcite to resolve very fine spatial details of the temporal evolution of the prominence ( fig . 1a and the online version of the h@xmath7 movie ) .",
    "further context was provided by imaging in the coronal line of fe ix at ( fig .",
    "1b ) observed with the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instrument onboard the solar dynamics observatory @xcite .        in this paper",
    ", we focus on the study of the third scan because of the double - helix appearence of the prominence feet .",
    "figure 1 displays the multiwavelength intensity , and polarimetric imaging of the observed prominence .",
    "both in the he i 1083.0 nm scan and h@xmath7 intensity images , one of the two prominence feet ( f2 from fig .",
    "1f ) shows a clear double - helix structure formed by two fibrils . a more compact , twisted helical structure",
    "can also be guessed in foot f1 .",
    "the two prominence feet correspond to vertical , dark ( absorption ) structures observed at 17.1 nm that resemble those recently named _ solar tornadoes _",
    "they were observable in the aia data for almost three more days , and on april 26 ( 23:38 ut ) , they suddenly erupted , showing a clear helical shape .",
    "interestingly , the foot f2 presents opposite polarities of the stokes @xmath8 parameter at both sides of one fibril ( f2a ) .",
    "this means that the magnetic field has reversed polarities along the line of sight at both sides of this fibril .",
    "moreover , when subtracting the average circular polarization ( i.e. , the mean longitudinal magnetic field ) to the other fibril of feet f2 ( panel f2b ) and to the other feet ( f1 ) , we find similar patterns .",
    "we analyze the spectro - polarimetric data using the numerical code hazel ( hanle zeeman light ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to recover the full magnetic field vector and the thermodynamical properties of the plasma .",
    "facing an inverse problem with observational data and a large number of dimensions is always ill - posed .",
    "a classical inversion code such as hazel retrieves one atmospheric model that fits the observed profiles , though others may exist . in our case ,",
    "the number of these ambiguous solutions depend on the regime of the magnetic field and , more importantly , on the scattering geometry .",
    "our approach is to find compatible solutions of the same inverse problem in each pixel and then select the global scenario physically compatible with the context .",
    "this procedure step is essential to reconstruct the global topology of the magnetic field in the prominence .",
    "the angle of the emitting atom in the local vertical ( or the observed strcuture if we assume it in the same plane ) with respect to the line - of - sight ( the scattering angle @xmath9 ) is a very important parameter to correctly infer the magnetic field vector from spectro - polarimetric signals generated from scattering processes . in order to determine it , we used the images of the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) at 17.1 nm in which we identified the feet of our observed prominence as two dark ( absorption ) vertical filaments ( fig .",
    "we followed these filaments as they entered onto the disk and detected their positions ( as a projection onto the plane of the sky ) .",
    "we measure the projected distance of the filaments to the limb @xmath10 over time @xmath11 and fit it with the approximate expression @xmath12 inferring the value of @xmath13 , the time at which the prominence feet were at the limb .",
    "the symbol @xmath14 is the radius of the parallel at latitude @xmath15 , and @xmath16 h@xmath17 is the solar angular velocity at that latitude .",
    "the distance @xmath10 was obtained as the length of the horizontal line from the foot to the limb , which is a good approximation close to the limb .",
    "the inferred scattering angle ( the angle between the line of sight and the local vertical ) is approximately given by @xmath18 the distance @xmath19 obtained by substituting @xmath20 , i.e. , the time of the observations , in eq .",
    "[ scatt_angle ] . after this procedure",
    ", we obtain that the spectro - polarimetric scan was taken at a scattering geometry of @xmath21 , i.e. while the prominence was slightly behind the limb .",
    "we follow a 2-step inversion scheme to obtain a robust convergence of the code .",
    "since the magnetic field is of second order to the intensity profile , we first use the intensity profile alone to infer the thermodynamical quantities . on a second step ,",
    "we fix the thermodynamical parameters and find the magnetic field vector using the information of the polarization profiles .    as stated before",
    ", this may not be the unique solution to the problem . in order to capture all possible solutions",
    "we follow , again , a 2-step procedure .",
    "first , we sample the space of parameters with approximate ( though appropriate ) analytical expressions .",
    "finally , we use these analytical solutions as initial guesses for a second hazel inversion .",
    "this will allow us to refine the solutions in the general unsaturated regime to overcome the approximations we have made .    in the case of an optically thin plasma , a normal zeeman triplet , and a magnetic field in the saturated hanle effect regime ",
    "when the larmor frequency is much larger than the inverse of the characteristic time for scattering , the geometric dependencies of polarization are simply expressed through the stokes parameters as @xcite : @xmath22 showing a dependence on the inclination @xmath23 and azimuth @xmath24 of the magnetic field with respect to the line - of - sight ( los ) , like in the zeeman effect , and an additional dependence on the geometry of the scattering event through the inclination @xmath25 of the magnetic field with respect to the local vertical ( lv ) .",
    "the linearly polarized components ( stokes @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) are dominated by scattering polarization and the hanle effect , while the circularly polarized component ( stokes @xmath8 ) is generated by the longitudinal zeeman effect , and defines the polarity of the magnetic field along the los @xcite .",
    "equations  [ eqs ] show a dependence of polarization on @xmath23 and @xmath24 that yield the well - known @xmath28-ambiguity for @xmath24 of classical zeeman diagnostics .",
    "the additional dependence on @xmath25 , characteristic of scattering processes , may yield two additional ambiguous solutions for the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the he  i 1083.0 nm line often forms close to the saturation regime described by eqs .",
    "[ eqs ] and all ( up to four ) ambiguous field configurations can be determined analytically ( see the appendix ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in order to have an idea of the potential multiple solutions we face , we have represented in figure [ diagrama ] the so - called hanle diagram : the amplitude of stokes @xmath26 and @xmath27 in terms of the inclination ( @xmath25 ) and azimuth ( @xmath29 ) of the magnetic field in the lv .",
    "the diagram is computed for a point at 15@xmath30 above the solar limb ( middle - upper parts of the observed prominence feet ) .",
    "we have assumed the saturation regime ( in particular a field strength of 30 g ) , and the scattering angle determined by our observations ( 98@xmath31 ) .",
    "the zero inclination is defined as a field in the lv , and the zero azimuth is defined in the los , being @xmath32 a field directed away from the observer .",
    "the more vertical fields ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) have four possible solutions irrespective of the azimuth value : two of them ( the ones represented by filled and empty circles ) are not ambiguous if circular polarization is observed , since it provides the sign of the longitudinal component of the magnetic field .",
    "the other two solutions have opposite polarities of the field in the lv .",
    "fields with inclinations between @xmath35 and @xmath36 have eight possible solutions : a more vertical inclination with the four solutions stated above and another four solutions with more inclined fields . in the case of our observations ,",
    "the sensitivity of circular polarization allows us to constrain the azimuth range , and hence only four ambiguous solutions need to be determined .",
    "the polarity of the field ( in the lv ) can not be determined . however , as we will see , this ambiguity is unimportant for the purposes of this paper .     scattering geometry and the saturation regime ( b=30 g ) .",

    "the hanle diagram for the range of inclinations between 90@xmath31 and @xmath28 is the same but with a reversed color palette .",

    "the ambiguities apply at each pixel of our observations .",
    "however , we assume that there are no tangential discontinuities or shocks and hence the magnetic field in the prominence draw continuous lines .",
    "we reconstructed four global topologies of the magnetic field which could be grouped into two broad categories : one with fields inclined by @xmath38 , and another one with more inclined fields ( @xmath39 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the projection of the field onto the plane of the sky is at an angle with the axis of each fibril that form the prominence feet .",
    "the fibril f2a ( displayed in fig .",
    "1 ) shows a los polarity reversal at opposite sides of its axis .",
    "similar los polarity inversions appear across the axes of the other fibrils when the average value of stokes v in the region , corresponding to the mean los component of the magnetic field , is subtracted ( figs .",
    "1f1 and 1f2b ) .",
    "put together , this points to an helical global topology in both families of solutions , with the more horizontal configurations showing a more twisted field .    in order to disambiguate the problem",
    ", we introduce a physical constraint through a stability analysis . according to the kruskal - shafranov criterion @xcite a kink instability develops when the amount of magnetic twist exceeds a critical value , so that a structure is stable if @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the radius and the length of the fibril , respectively , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the vertical and azimuthal components of the magnetic field , respectively . estimating and for our prominence , the stability criterion yields 0.09 for the solution with the fields around 90@xmath31 and 1.28 for the fields with inclinations of @xmath45 .",
    "figure 2 shows the magnetic field strength and topology of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field strength has very similar values throughout all families of solutions . in most of the prominence",
    "the magnetic field strength is below 20  g , but shows filamentary structures , parallel to the helix structure , of higher field strength ( @xmath46 g ; fig .",
    "the projection of the field onto the plane of the sky is always roughly perpendicular to the solar limb , and at an angle ( @xmath47-@xmath48 ) with the axis of the fibrils that form the prominence feet ( fig .",
    "all fibrils present magnetic field polarity reversals at both sides of their axis .",
    "this implies a helical field along the fibrils with the axis in the plane of the sky in f2a ( since the average longitudinal magnetic field is close to zero ) , and slightly tilted relative to the lv in the other fibrils ( since polarity reversals are only seen when the mean longitudinal magnetic field is subtracted ) .",
    "the helical magnetic fields of the two fibrils are interlaced to form a double - helix that constitutes one foot of the prominence ( see fig . 3 and the online movie of the artistic representation of the field topology ) .",
    "the feet magnetically connect the spine with lower layers , in contrast to previous works suggesting that feet are just a collection of dips at different heights @xcite .",
    "the intensity profiles of the he i line carry information on the los velocity , opacity , temperature , and density of the structure .",
    "we recover all these parameters along with the magnetic topology using the hazel code .",
    "they have the same values for all families of solutions of the magnetic field .",
    "figure 5a shows the inferred los velocities .",
    "interestingly , they have opposite signs at both sides of both feet of the prominence ( f1 and f2 ) , with values up to ( similar values as * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the neutral atoms of he still trace the field lines , this pattern of velocities could be a natural consequence if the prominence material is flowing along the inferred double - helix structure of the prominence feet .",
    "note that f1 has a positive - negative doppler pattern at lower heights , while it has a negative - positive one higher in the feet , as we would expect for a more compact double - helix , which implies a larger twist .",
    "if the material is flowing along the helical field lines of the fibrils of each feet , a doppler pattern similar to that of large scales should be observed at smaller scales .",
    "the upper parts of f2a show a positive - negative pattern .",
    "the rest of the fibrils have a continuous increase of the doppler velocity as we move from left to right across the structure .",
    "this could be interpreted as a negative - positive pattern if the fibrils are not at a 90@xmath31 scattering geometry , which is very likely .",
    "the two fibrils of f2 exhibit a periodic motion in the h@xmath7 space - time diagram , with a period of @xmath46 min ( fig .",
    "5b ) , consistent with the periods reported in @xcite for solar tornadoes .",
    "assuming that the change in h@xmath7 brightness is only due to plasma movements , the observed periodic motion could be also interpreted in terms of plasma flowing along helical field lines .",
    "rotation of the magnetic structure is very unlikely since the observed @xmath49 min period would imply a full turn of the magnetic field in less than one hour .",
    "this will considerably increase the twist of the structure and will soon make it unstable under magnetohydrodynamical instabilities ( easily within a day ) .",
    "the plane - of - the - sky periodic motions show maximum tangential velocities of @xmath50 km s@xmath17 , which are far larger than the ones inferred from the doppler effect in the hei line",
    ". we must be careful to directly relate those two velocities since doppler measurements are generated only by plasma motions while changes in h@xmath7 brightness can not only be assigned to plasma movements but to changes in the thermal conditions .",
    "the feet of the observed prominence harbor helical magnetic fields . after assuming a simple stability criterion",
    ", we have a preference for the more vertical solution and conclude that the magnetic fields in prominence feet connect the spine with the underlying atmosphere .",
    "these results are in contrast to the scenario in which these structures are formed by a series of local horizontal dips that sustain the plasma at different heights @xcite . assuming a uniformly twisted straight cylinder , the magnetic field displays a twist ( number of turns over its length @xmath42 ) of 1.32 at each fibril .",
    "we speculate that the connectivity of the prominence spine , with a well - defined helicity , and the photospheric magnetic field below , with a fluctuating topology , may naturally yield the kind of helical structures we find .",
    "the hei doppler velocities display opposite velocities along the los at both sides of prominence feet .",
    "the h@xmath7 intensity displays periodic motions in the plane - of - the - sky . using only the doppler velocities or the plane - of - the - sky motions alone",
    "do not allow to reach any conclusion on the plasma motions and can lead to controversies in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we put the hei and the h@xmath7 information together , we could interpret these observations as the material of the prominence flowing along helical field lines .",
    "however , the los doppler velocities inferred from the hei line and the tangential velocities expected for the observed period of the h@xmath7 images do not match . it could be that neutral h and he clouds have different thermodynamical properties or it could be that the changes in the h@xmath7 brightness have an important contribution from changing thermal conditions , but we need more data to really understand this issue .    the prominence remains stable for several days , and we think that the magnetic topology of the prominence feet reported in this paper plays a fundamental role on the stability of the prominence as a whole .",
