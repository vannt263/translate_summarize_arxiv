    "the lowering of the coulomb potential has two effects : on the one hand , the energy level is shifted to lower energies , on the other hand , at a certain critical distance , the threshold of potential energy between neighboured atoms crosses the shifted electrons energy level , and the bound state is dissolved into the continuum .",
    "this is the case , if the distance between neighbours comes into the range of the extension of the electrons wave - function .",

    "such levels appear only during the process of expansion and may be used as a signal to infer the state of the microplasma at the corresponding time stage .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the observed balmer spectra can not be interpreted within an equilibrium picture of the laser produced microplasma .",
    "we could not infer consistent values of plasma parameters for temperature and density .",
    "a consistent description is only possible if the time evolution of the expanding microplasma is considered as a non - equilibrium process .",
    "we follow the dynamical expansion of the laser excited hydrogen droplet as given by the hydrodynamical calculation .",
    "first , the time evolution of the density is considered , with account to the effective densities derived from the measured line profiles .",
    "thereby , one can determine the time at which the h@xmath101 line appears , i.e. where the inferred density @xmath164 is reached .",

    "the critical density for h@xmath103 , @xmath174 is reached after 0.8 ns .",
