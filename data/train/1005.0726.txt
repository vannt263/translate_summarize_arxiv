    "<S> for the result of model ( i ) , shown by the left - column three panels of fig .  2 , the measurement time @xmath0 is carried out using the wave - packet analysis , while the dephasing rate @xmath1 is computed respectively by the three methods _ ( i)_-_(iii ) _ outlined above . for @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> we observe serious deviation from the desired result ( solid line ) , indicating that either the smallest - eigenvalue method ( dotted line ) or the glauber coherence function approach ( dashed line ) breaks down in this context , particularly for small @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> since we are considering a strong coupling detector ( i.e. with large @xmath54 interaction ) , the dephasing rate is dominantly determined by @xmath66 , being nearly independent of @xmath73 . concerning the efficiency of model ( i ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find that merely increasing the tunneling asymmetry @xmath73 can not reach the quantum limit in weak or even relatively strong response regimes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the tunneling asymmetry , the efficiency is also bounded by , and actually quite sensitive to , the response strength . </S>",
    "<S> this feature contradicts our intuition that an asymmetric set is like a point - contact ( pc ) detector , by noting that an ideal pc detector has unit quantum efficiency which is independent of the response strength . </S>",
    "<S> we also notice that this conclusion differs from some statements in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but agrees well with the fact that the signal - to - noise ratio is considerably affected by the response strength @xcite .    for the strong response detector model ( ii ) , </S>",
    "<S> we now demonstrate that the quantum limit can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the respective @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are plotted in the right column of fig  2 . the solid - line in the upper panel plots the simple result @xmath74 from the waiting - time analysis , while the dotted - line shows the result from the wave - packet analysis as a comparison . for @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> shown in the mid - panel , we again find that the dephasing is dominantly caused by the tunneling events from the left lead of set to its central dot , i.e. , @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted and dashed lines , respectively from the smallest eigenvalue and the glauber coherence function methods , clearly show the extent of failure when applied to this model . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , quite straightforwardly , the quantum efficiency is analytically obtained as : @xmath76 from this result , we see that the measurement is to be quantum limited with increasing @xmath77 .    note that what this model ( ii ) performs is actually a _ </S>",
    "<S> strong projective measurement _ since one can immediately conclude that the qubit is in one of the basis states if an electron tunnels through the detector . in terms of ensemble </S>",
    "<S> average times as used in the quantum efficiency definition ( i.e. , average over large number of transmitted and reflected events ) , the random tunneling through the left junction ( equivalently , the random occupation of the set dot ) determines the dephasing rate of the qubit , while the detection in the right reservoir for the tunneled electron determines the measurement time . in this ensemble average sense , </S>",
    "<S> the qubit coherence is destroyed by the first jump , and the measurement rate is governed by the current @xmath78 .    for strong projective measurement , </S>",
    "<S> however , it may not be immediately clear how the fact whether the detector is quantum - limited or not would manifest itself in each single realization of measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we may explain this issue in terms of possible information loss in each single realization of projective measurement . </S>",
    "<S> let us reconsider the measurement process . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the left reservoir ( source ) emits a measuring electron , this electron first tunnels through the left junction , then through the right one , and is finally detected in the right reservoir ( drain ) . from an information - theoretic point of view , the right - hand - side detector can not distinguish whether there is a tunneling event from the left reservoir to the set dot . </S>",
    "<S> this implies an information loss , and results in a non - unit quantum efficiency which makes sense even at the level of single projective measurement . to avoid this information loss , </S>",
    "<S> one possible way is to detect the tunneling electron in the right reservoir with increase of the tunneling asymmetry @xmath79 , as indicated by the above calculation . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , based on the information - theoretic discussion , for model ( ii ) with arbitrary @xmath79 , one can also reach the quantum limit by alternatively detecting electron tunneling through the left junction . </S>",
    "<S> this can be implemented by adding a nearby point - contact to detect the charge state of the set dot , similar to the experiment by gustavsson _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this way , the information - gain rate coincides with the dephasing rate , leading thus to a unit quantum efficiency .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion._ to summarize , we have presented an analysis for the quantum efficiency of qubit measurements with a set detector . </S>",
    "<S> two models were analyzed : one corresponds to a strong response set , and the other is a tunable one in response strength . </S>",
    "<S> we found that quantum limited measurements can be achieved only in a limiting case of strong response as schematically shown by model ( ii ) , together with an asymmetric tunneling setup . in the most range of response strengths , </S>",
    "<S> the set detector can not reach the quantum limit of efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be qualitatively understood by means of an information - theoretic interpretation , and are quantitatively demonstrated with direct calculations by appropriately justifying the measurement and backaction dephasing rates .    </S>",
