    "we start with the phenomenological hamiltonian for graphene proposed by baskaran@xcite : @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the creation operators on the two inequivalent lattice sites of the honeycomb lattice , see fig .",
    "[ fig : junction]a , @xmath16  ev is the hopping parameter , @xmath17 indicates nearest neighbors , and @xmath18 is the effective chemical potential where @xmath19 corresponds to the dirac point .",
    "the sb correlations are modeled by the last term where @xmath20 is the spin - singlet creation operator on the bond between atoms @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath21 and therefore the last term in equation ( [ eq : h_sb ] ) both effectively models the sb correlations and shows its cooper pairing nature .",
    "the effective coupling constant @xmath22 has been estimated to be as large as @xmath23.@xcite using @xmath24 as the mean - field order parameter , equation ( [ eq : h_sb ] ) can solved with a double bogoliubov - valatin transformation . here @xmath25 denotes the nearest neighbor bond , see again fig .",
    "[ fig : junction]a , and we allow the order parameter to be independent on the three bonds .",
    "the most favorable superconducting state in the bulk has @xmath26 which corresponds to a @xmath27-wave symmetry in the brillouin zone . as long as @xmath28 this state has a finite @xmath3 for any finite doping level and @xmath3 increases rapidly with either hole or electron doping.@xcite    in addition to equation  ( [ eq : h_sb ] ) , the influence of the superconducting contacts , deposited on top of the graphene sheet as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : junction]b , has to be taken into account .",
    "we do this by assuming that the contacts induce into the s regions of the graphene a ) an effective paring potential and b ) a high doping level . for @xmath1-wave",
    "contacts the simplest effective pairing potential is the same @xmath22-term as for the intrinsic sb correlations .",
    "we therefore chose to model the effect of the contacts with a strong @xmath22-term in the s regions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : junction]c . the particular @xmath1-wave  symmetry in the s regions is fixed to the @xmath29-wave on the zigzag interface which is achieved by setting @xmath30.@xcite we have checked that a @xmath31 rotation of either interface or @xmath1-wave  symmetry produces no notable change in the proximity effect .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath1-wave  symmetry is still unrestricted in the n region , though with the symmetry fixed in the s regions and relatively short junctions , the same symmetry choice in n is now energetically favored .",
    "we should also note that we have set an artificially high value for @xmath22 in s in order to get a short superconducting coherence length @xmath32 and therefore reduce the computational size of the problem .",
    "however , we believe our conclusions are still applicable for an experimental setup with , e.g. , a @xmath1-wave  high-@xmath3 cuprate superconductor as the contact metal .",
    "the doping is set to be high in the s regions since the superconducting contacts act as large electronic reservoirs directly in contact with the graphene . in the n region",
    "we assume that the doping level is finite in order to produce a non - zero @xmath3 for the intrinsic sb correlations .",
    "in fact , the doping in the n region is kept moderately high in our calculations in order to deal with numerically accessible @xmath3s for the sb superconductivity .",
    "but , since our results use only @xmath3 as the relevant sb parameter , this should not affect the generalization of our results to a more realistic lower doping regime .",
    "we assume that the effective chemical potential abruptly drops at the sn interfaces . while this is a simplification , a moderate leakage of charge from s to n",
    "would only raise the intrinsic @xmath3 in the interface region and thus enhance the sb pairing effect .",
    "the above framework can be solved self - consistently for the position - dependent @xmath33 using the tb bdg formalism for ballistic graphene sns josephson junctions.@xcite we assume clean , smooth interfaces in order to reduce the computational effort but we do not expect a moderately disordered interface to significantly change our results.@xcite it is the use of an effective pairing potential instead of an effective order parameter in the s regions that allows us to solve self - consistently for the order parameter .",
    "this leads to a self - consistent calculation of the proximity effect depletion in s and leakage into n of the pair amplitude @xmath34 and its norm @xmath35 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : jinnproxeff ] .",
    "this should be compared to the analytical dirac - bdg ( dbdg ) formalism developed for graphene sns josephson junctions@xcite where the order parameter is assumed to be constant in the s regions .",
    "not only is a self - consistent solution necessary for studying the coupling between the externally induced @xmath1-wave  state and the sb pairing correlations but a recent comparison between the two methods has also demonstrated the necessity for a self - consistent solution when unconventional contacts are considered.@xcite",
    "the most straightforward physical quantity to study in the tb bdg framework is the proximity effect , or more specifically , the cooper pair amplitude distribution in the sns junction .",
    "if a measurable signal of sb correlations were found in this quantity , there ought to be signs in other , more easily experimentally measurable , quantities such as the josephson current .",
    "[ fig : jinnproxeff ] shows the norm of the pair amplitude , @xmath35 , for a @xmath1-wave  contact sns junction .    in black",
    "are the results when the sb correlations are ignored at two different temperatures and , as seen , the results are essentially temperature independent in this range .",
    "when sb correlations are included ( red ) the pair amplitude in n increases .",
    "the pair amplitude inside n is in fact larger by almost an order of a magnitude than it would have been in a bulk sample with the same strength sb pairing .",
    "this means that in @xmath1-wave  contact sns junctions the intrinsic sb pairing is heavily benefitting from the proximity to the superconducting contacts .",
    "this is despite the large fermi level mis - match ( flm ) at the sn interfaces , due to different doping levels in s and n , which acts as an effective interface barrier.@xcite however , since the extrinsic superconducting state and the intrinsic sb pairing here by design have the same symmetry this is probably not a too surprising result .",
    "more interesting is the temperature scale over which this enhanced sb pairing takes place .",
    "the solid curve is for @xmath36 , i.e.  when the doping level is sufficient for intrinsic sb superconductivity to be present , and the dashed curve is recorded when @xmath37 .",
    "we thus see a strongly enhanced proximity effect in the sns junction even far above @xmath3 .",
    "one very closely related , but easier quantifiable , property to the proximity effect is the superconducting decay length , or normal state coherence length @xmath38 , which is the length scale over which the pairing amplitude ( exponentially ) decay inside n : @xmath39 fig .",
    "[ fig : decaylength ] shows the inverse temperature dependence of @xmath38 for several different strengths of the intrinsic sb pairing . in black circles",
    "are the results when sb correlations are ignored whereas colored crosses show the results when they are present with the vertical lines indicating the corresponding intrinsic @xmath3 .",
    "the red and magenta curves correspond to the same @xmath3 but achieved through different combinations of sb correlation strength @xmath22 and doping level , which demonstrates the dependence on @xmath3 only .    from the figure",
    "we clearly see that to a good approximation @xmath40 in the uncorrelated case . for any finite sb pairing inside",
    "n , @xmath38 will diverge at the corresponding intrinsic @xmath3 leading to a giant proximity effect for temperatures close to @xmath3 .",
    "the same diverging behavior has recently also been predicted for the square lattice for both @xmath12-wave  and @xmath1-wave  contact sns junctions when the n region exhibits weak superconductivity of the same symmetry,@xcite although this study was conducted with no flm at the sn interfaces .",
    "the increase in proximity effect far above @xmath3 documented in fig .",
    "[ fig : jinnproxeff ] , is here reflected in an increased decay length even at elevated temperatures .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : decaylength ] shows that for temperatures moderately to high above @xmath3 we can extract the following functional form for the superconducting decay length : @xmath41 the limited accuracy due to finite model systems makes our numerical data deviate from this relationship at temperatures close to @xmath3 , but we expect equation  ( [ eq : tdepxi ] ) to be valid even as @xmath42 . from this",
    "we can conclude that any evidence of a divergence in @xmath38 at a non - zero temperature with a @xmath2 functional form in a @xmath1-wave  contact graphene sns junction would be a clear measurement of the strength of the intrinsic sb correlations in graphene",
    ".    it would also be useful to characterize the effect of sb correlations on the most accessible property of a sns junction , namely the josephson current .",
    "[ fig : icvst ] shows the critical current as a function of temperature when sb correlations are ignored ( circles ) and present ( crosses ) for three different doping levels in n. the corresponding @xmath3s for the sb pairing are again marked with vertical lines .    as seen , the josephson current increases with decreasing temperatures in all cases .",
    "this is expected since @xmath38 is inversely proportional to the temperature .",
    "there is also a pronounced increase in the current when sb correlations are present in the junction , and , most importantly , the current is enhanced far above @xmath3 . for systems with stronger sb correlations ,",
    "the current increases more compared to the uncorrelated case at and below @xmath3 .",
    "this effect is not due to the decay length per see , since @xmath38 diverges at @xmath3 for all strengths of the sb correlations , but related to the strength of the intrinsic sb superconducting state in n.",
    "the results in figs .  [ fig : jinnproxeff]-[fig : icvst ] clearly demonstrate that the intrinsic sb correlations in graphene are greatly enhanced in a graphene @xmath1-wave  contact sns josephson junction even far above their intrinsic @xmath3 .",
    "since the intrinsic sb correlations at the currently experimentally fairly limited doping levels of graphene are expected to be rather weak , this enhancement even far above @xmath3 is crucial for any experimental detection and a finding of a finite @xmath3 in a graphene @xmath1-wave  contact sns josephson junction will directly establish the strength of the effective sb coupling @xmath22 as a function of the doping level of the graphene .        , _ _ ( , , ) , * * , ( ) , , , , , * * , ( ) , , , , , , , , * * , ( ) , * * , ( ) , * * , ( ) , * * , ( ) , * * , ( ) , * * , ( ) , * * , ( ) , , , ( ) , * * , ( ) , , , , * * , ( ) , , , in _ _ , edited by ( , ) , chap .   , , , , , , ,",
