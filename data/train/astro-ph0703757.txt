    "the nature of dark matter ( dm ) is , more than 70 years after its discovery , still an open problem .",
    "it is commonly assumed that dm is made of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , arising in theories beyond the standard model ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) , the most widely discussed dm candidates being the supersymmetric neutralino and the lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) in theories with unified extra - dimensions @xcite .",
    "these particles will be actively searched for in upcoming high energy physics experiments such as the large hadron collider ( lhc , see e.g. refs.@xcite for recent discussions in the context of dm searches ) , while hints on the nature of dm may already come from direct detection experiments aiming at detecting the nuclear recoils due to dm scattering off nuclei in large detectors ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent update on the status of direct searches ) .",
    "alternatively , one could search for dm _ indirectly _ , i.e. through the detection of its annihilation products such as photons , neutrinos , positrons and antiprotons .",
    "the annihilation rate being proportional to the square of the dm density , ideal targets of indirect searches include all those regions where the dm density is strongly enhanced , due to gravitational clustering , as in the case of the galactic center @xcite and halo substructures @xcite , or because of energy losses capture in large celestial bodies , as in the case of the sun and the earth ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "large dm overdensities can also form as a consequence of astrophysical processes , such as the adiabatic growth of supermassive  @xcite or intermediate mass black holes  @xcite .",
    "in fact , dm halos inevitably react to the growth of black holes , leading , in the case of adiabatic growth , to the formation of large dm overdensities called _ spikes _ @xcite .",
    "a dm cusp with a power - law density profile @xmath3 , gets redistributed after the bh growth into a steeper profile @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , within the radius of gravitational influence of the black hole ( bh ) ( see below for further details ) .",
    "bhs can thus be thought as _ annihilation boosters _ , because the annihilation rate after their growth is boosted by several orders of magnitude , making these objects ideal targets for indirect dm searches . even in absence of mergers  @xcite , and ignoring a possible off - center formation  @xcite , a spike around the supermassive bh at the galactic center would inevitably be destroyed by the combined effect of gravitational scattering off the _ observed _ stellar cusp at the gc , and dm annihilations  @xcite .",
    "the very same gravitational processes can still lead to the formation of moderate enhancements called _ crests _ ( collisionally regenerated structures ) , but these structures do not lead to significant enhancements of the annihilation signal  @xcite . _",
    "mini - spikes _ around intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) are more promising targets of indirect detection , since they would not be affected by these dynamical processes , and they should appear as bright point - like sources , which could be easily detected by large field of view gamma - ray experiments as glast @xcite and further studied with ground - based air cherenkov telescopes ( acts ) @xcite such as cangaroo @xcite , hess @xcite , magic @xcite and veritas @xcite . + here ,",
    "we further explore the mini - spikes scenario , and focus on the population of imbhs in the andromeda galaxy ( also known as m31 ) , a spiral galaxy very similar to the milky way ( mw ) , whose center is located @xmath6 away from us .",
    "we compute gamma - ray fluxes from dm annihilations around imbhs in m31 , and show that the prospects for detection with glast are very promising : in an optimistic case ( a neutralino with a mass @xmath7 and annihilation cross section @xmath8 ) , glast may detect up to 20 point - like sources ( at @xmath9 and with a 2 months exposure ) , within @xmath10 from the center of andromeda .",
    "the proposed observational strategy appears particularly suited for acts like magic and veritas , ( m31 is in a region of the sky not accessible to hess ) , since the main difficulty in the search for galactic mini - spikes is that they can not perform _ deep _ full - sky searches , due to their limited field of view . in the case of mini - spikes in m31",
    ", acts can search for them by scanning a small region of @xmath11 around the center of m31 , and an effective exposure of @xmath12 hours in this region would be sufficient to probe the proposed scenario , at least for dm mass in the tev range .",
    "the next - generation cherenkov telescopes array ( cta)@xcite , is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity , increase the field of view and decrease the energy threshold with respect to existing acts , thus representing an ideal experiment for the proposed scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : next section ( section [ sec : chapter two ] ) is devoted to describe the formation scenario of imbhs .",
    "we then ( section [ sec : chapter three ] ) present the imbhs catalogue and how it is adapted to the andromeda galaxy .",
    "we compute the gamma - ray flux emitted by each point - like spike around an imbh , considering a particular energy annihilation spectrum for a dm particle . in section [ sec : chapter four ] we estimate the prospects for detection for a generic act .",
    "then in section [ sec : chapter five ] we turn to glast .",
    "finally our results are discussed in section [ sec : chapter six ] .",
    "imbhs are compact objects with mass larger than @xmath13 , the heaviest remnant of a stellar collapse @xcite , and smaller than @xmath14 , the lower end of the mass range of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) @xcite .",
    "the theoretical and observational motivations for imbhs were recently reviewed in ref .",
    "for instance , ultra - luminous x - ray point sources ( ulxs ) could be interpreted as accreting imbhs , since alternative explanations in terms of agns , neutron stars or smbhs appear to be problematic or even ruled out  @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", a population of massive seed black holes could help to explain the origin of smbhs .",
    "in fact , observations of quasars at redshift @xmath15 in the sloan digital survey  @xcite suggest that smbhs were already in place when the universe was only @xmath16 gyr old , a circumstance that can be understood in terms of rapid growth starting from massive seeds ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in fact , a generic prediction of scenarios that seek to explain the properties of the observed supermassive black hole population , is that a large number of `` wandering '' imbhs should exist in dm halos  @xcite . despite their theoretical interest",
    ", it is difficult to obtain conclusive evidence for the existence of imbhs .",
    "a viable detection strategy could be the search for gravitational waves produced in the mergers of the imbh population  @xcite , with space - based interferometers such as lisa  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , two scenarios for imbhs formation have been considered .",
    "the first posits imbhs as remnants of the collapse of population iii stars .",
    "zero - metallicity population iii stars are more massive than more recent metal - enriched stars and , if heavier than @xmath17 , they would collapse directly into black holes ( @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .    here , we will focus only on the second scenario , based on ref .",
    "@xcite , where imbhs form at high redshift from gas collapsing in mini - halos .",
    "if the latter are massive enough , proto - galactic disks form at the center of each halo .",
    "gravitational instabilities introduce an effective viscosity that causes an inward mass and an outward angular momentum flow .",
    "the process goes on till it is interrupted by feedback from star formation ( 1 - 10 myrs ) that heats the disk .",
    "then the so - formed object undergoes gravitational collapse into a black hole .",
    "a characteristic mass scale of @xmath18 is imprinted to the mini - halo by the requirements that it is heavy enough to form a gravitational unstable disc and that the black hole formation timescale is shorter than the typical major mergers one .",
    "the resulting black holes have a mass log - normally scattered , with a @xmath19 , around the mean value of  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is that fraction of the baryonic mass which loses its angular moment that remains in the remnant black hole .",
    "@xmath22 is the fraction of the total baryonic mass in the halo that has fallen into the disc , @xmath23 is the halo virial mass , @xmath24 is the redshift of formation and @xmath25 the timescale for the evolution of the first generation of stars .",
    "+ in ref .",
    "@xcite bertone et al . have studied the population of imbhs in the mw , following the evolution of mini - halos hosting imbhs at high redshift ( populated with the prescriptions of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , down to redshift @xmath26 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) . as a result",
    ", they obtained 200 realizations of the imbhs population in the galaxy , that were used to produce 200 mock catalogs of dm mini - spikes , and to study the prospects for detection of these objects in the galaxy .",
    "the average number of unmerged imbhs was found to be @xmath27 , and each of these objects is characterized by its mass , distance from the center of the galaxy , and surrounding dm distribution .      following earlier work on the dynamics of stars and dm around compact objects ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , gondolo and silk have shown that the adiabatic growth of a massive black hole in the center of a dark halo modifies the distribution of the surrounding dm , inducing an enhancement of the density called `` spike '' @xcite .",
    "they focused their attention on the smbh at the center of our galaxy , but the same formalism can be applied also to imbhs .",
    "the initial dm distribution in all mini - halos can be adequately parametrized with a navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) profile  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , called the scale radius , sets the radius at which the profile slope changes",
    ". the new profile after the adiabatic growth , will be @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the density function of the initial nfw profile .",
    "@xmath32 gives the upper limit inside which eq . [ eqn : powerlaw ] is considered valid and is related to the radius of gravitational influence of the black hole @xmath33 : @xmath34 @xcite , where @xmath35 is implicitly defined as : @xmath36 with @xmath37 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "+ the spike profile diverges at low radii but annihilations set an upper limit to the physical density . solving the evolution of the dm particles number density , one finds that the upper limit depends on the microphysical properties of the dm particles ( mass and annihilation cross section ) and on the evolution timescale of the black hole .",

    "as we shall see the prospects for detection depend on the expected or measured experimental performances , but also on the atmospheric and astrophysical backgrounds .",

    "the calculations in this section are performed for a generic act , but they are particularly relevant for two specific experiments : magic and veritas . as for hess , being located in namibia , it can not detect gamma - rays from the direction of andromeda .    to determine the significance of the signal from an individual mini - spike ,",
    "as calculated in the previous section , we compare the number of signal photons , to the fluctuations of the background @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the exposure time , @xmath50 the effective area , @xmath51 the solid angle , @xmath52 is the total background differential flux",
    ".    for air cherenkov telescopes , the main background is due to hadrons interacting with the atmosphere and producing electromagnetic showers . following ref .",
    "@xcite @xcite , we consider @xmath53        the ratio of the number of hadrons misinterpreted as gamma - rays , over the total number of cosmic ray hadrons , @xmath54 , provides an estimate of the telescope potential to discriminate the gamma - ray signal from the hadronic background .",

    "the minimum flux for a 5@xmath57 detection with an effective area of @xmath58 @xcite and an exposure time of 100 hours , is @xmath59 .    to produce this estimate we have considered values of effective area and angular resolution similar to magic and the result is consistent with earlier estimates of the magic sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "an actual estimate of the instrument performance suggests that the minimum flux can be up to an order of magnitude higher  @xcite .",
    "+ the fluxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : averagemap ] are thus found to lie below the minimum detectable flux so determined , so one may navely conclude that there is no hope to detect them with this experimental setting",
    ". however , for a more careful assessment of the prospects for detection , we need to estimate the detectability in each realization and _ then _ average over all the realization , and not viceversa .",
    "in fact , as demonstrated in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : first_ma ] , in each random realization , the emission is much more patchy , with a large number of high emission peaks , corresponding to individual mini - spikes , that can thus be resolved with the adopted angular resolution .",
    "black circles highlight the position of objects brighter than the experimental sensitivity ( indicated in the color scale by the black line ) . in total , for @xmath60 , the number of detectable imbhs is @xmath61 , where the error is relative to the 1-@xmath62 scatter among different realizations .",
    "we note that current simulations indicate that the next - generation cherenkov telescopes array ( cta)@xcite , may significantly improve the sensitivity , down to @xmath63 , thus leading to a substantial improvement in the prospects for detection .",
    "the space satellite glast is expected to play a crucial role in indirect dm searches , thanks both to its ability to perform observations at energy scales comparable to the mass of common dm candidates and to its potential of making deep full - sky maps in gamma - rays , thanks to its large ( @xmath64 sr ) field of view  @xcite . despite the smaller effective area ,",
    "it is not affected , being a satellite , by the atmospheric hadronic and electron background .",
    "furthermore , its lower energy threshold ( 30 mev ) allows to probe lighter dm particles , typically leading to higher fluxes .",
    "the angular resolution of glast is @xmath65 in the energy range 30 mev-500 mev , becomes @xmath66 from 500 mev to 4 gev , and reaches @xmath67 above 4 gev @xcite .    as in the case of acts ,",
    "we compare the expected fluxes with the photon background , which in this case , since glast will perform observations above the atmosphere , is mainly due to diffuse gamma - ray emission .",
    "the galactic and extragalactic background has been measured in @xcite by egret in the energy range between 30 mev and 10 gev and we extrapolate it to higher energies by fitting with a power - law with spectral index of -2.1 .",
    "the resulting formula is @xmath68    we note here that a large fraction of the observed gamma - ray background might be actually due to dm annihilations  @xcite , in particular if astrophysical processes can boost the annihilation signal  @xcite . in this case , the smoking - gun for this scenario would be the distinctive shape of the angular power - spectrum of the background , that may allow , already with glast , the discrimination against ordinary astrophysical sources  @xcite .    the sensitivity above 30 mev , i.e. the minimum detectable flux for a 5@xmath57 detection with an exposure of 2 months , is found to be @xmath69 .",
    "this value is derived from eq .",
    "[ eqn : sigma ] , adopting values of the energy dependent effective area provided by  @xcite , and is consistent with glast sensitivity maps obtained in ref .",

    "black circles highlight those objects that produce a flux detectable at @xmath76 with glast , with a 2 months exposure .",
    "although we have performed the analysis of the prospects for detection with glast and acts for 2 different benchmark scenarios ( essentially high dm particle mass for acts , low @xmath77 for glast ) , the analysis can be easily extended to any value of the particle physics parameters of the annihilating dm particle . to explore the dependence on @xmath77",
    ", we show in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : radiale ] the number of objects that can be detected with the aforementioned experiments , as a function of the dm particle mass . near the experiment threshold ,",
    "fluxes increase with mass .",
    "when @xmath78 this threshold effect disappears and one recovers the expected behavior ( smaller fluxes for higher masses ) .",
    "similarly , one can plot the number of detectable objects as a function of the angular distance from the center of m31 , to estimate the region where most mini - spikes can be found .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : radiale ] where the total number of objects is also shown for comparison .",
    "vertical lines denote the angular size of the region that contains 90% of the detectable imbhs for the various experiments , which has a characteristic size of @xmath79 .    we stress that while in the case of galactic imbhs the identification of mini - spikes will require a case - by - case analysis of the spectral properties of unidentified gamma - ray sources , the detection of a cluster of sources around the center of andromeda would _ per se _ provide unmistakable evidence for the proposesd scenario .",
    "in conclusion , we have computed gamma - ray fluxes from dm annihilations in mini - spikes around imbhs in the andromeda galaxy .",
    "we have studied the prospects for detection with air cherenkov telescopes like magic and veritas and with the glast satellite , and found that a handful of sources might be within the reach of current acts , while the prospects for the planned cta are more encouraging .",
    "the obvious advantage of the proposed scenario with respect to mini - spikes in the mw , is that they are not randomly distributed over the sky , but they are contained , at 90% , within 3 degrees from the center of andromeda , and can thus be searched for with acts by performing a deep scan of this small region .",
    "the prospects for glast appear more promising , since an exposure time of 2 months allows the detection of up to of @xmath80 mini - spikes , that would be resolved as a cluster of point - sources with identical spectra , within a @xmath81 region around the center of andromeda .",
    "such a distinctive prediction can not be mimicked by ordinary astrophysical sources . as in the case of imbhs in the mw",
    ", null searches would place very strong constraints on the proposed scenario in a wide portion of the dm parameter space .",

    "<S> the existence of a population of wandering intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) is a generic prediction of scenarios that seek to explain the formation of supermassive black holes in terms of growth from massive seeds . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of imbhs may lead to the formation of dm overdensities called `` mini - spikes '' , recently proposed as ideal targets for indirect dm searches . </S>",
    "<S> current ground - based gamma - ray experiments , however , can not search for these objects due to their limited field of view , and it might be challenging to discriminate mini - spikes in the milky way from the many astrophysical sources that glast is expected to observe . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that gamma - ray experiments can effectively search for imbhs in the nearby andromeda galaxy ( also known as m31 ) , where mini - spikes would appear as a distribution of point - sources , isotropically distributed in a @xmath0 circle around the galactic center . for a neutralino - like dm candidate with a mass @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , up to 20 sources would be detected with glast ( at @xmath2 , in 2 months ) . with air cherenkov telescopes such as magic and veritas , </S>",
    "<S> up to 10 sources might be detected , provided that the mass of neutralino is in the tev range or above . </S>"
