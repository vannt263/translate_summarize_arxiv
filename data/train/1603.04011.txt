    "interstellar complex organic molecules ( coms ) , which are defined as carbon - containing molecules with 6 or more atoms , have attracted increasing interest in the past few decades  @xcite . although this definition can refer to the unsaturated carbon - chain species detected in cold cores , the acronym is more commonly used to refer to the more terrestrial - like molecules most strongly associated with hot cores and corinos .",
    "the interest in coms derives not only from the fact that coms can be good probes of physical conditions of astronomical sources , but also because coms may be the basis of prebiotic molecules , which may be related to the origin of life .",
    "although coms were first observed in hot cores  @xcite , they are also detected in a variety of other types of astronomical sources in the early phases of star formation  @xcite .",
    "progress in the astrochemical modeling of com formation has been driven by new observations of these species .",
    "coms were first believed to be synthesized in the gas phase from precursors formed on cold dust grains and desorbed into the gas as the temperature of dust grains increased  @xcite .",
    "new observations towards hot corinos and the galactic center challenged the original hypothesis that coms are formed in the gas phase  @xcite . moreover , new experimental and computational results showed that the gas phase syntheses used in the original models of coms are not efficient enough to explain the abundances of methyl formate and other species in hot cores and corinos  @xcite .",
    "a commonly accepted formation mechanism , which is consistent with observations in these sources , has been developed  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "zeroth generation coms such as methanol are formed on the growing ice mantles of cold dust grains by one mobile reactant , typically an atom or a diatomic molecule bound sufficiently loosely to a grain to diffuse rapidly even at 10 k , and another species .",
    "more complex species than methanol may also be formed by this mechanism . as the temperature increases , photodissociation products of zeroth generation coms , which are typically radicals , are able to diffuse on dust grain surfaces .",
    "the more strongly bound of these species do not desorb initially ; thus , they can recombine via radical - radical association reactions to produce the first generation coms , such as methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath1 ) .",
    "subsequent photodissociation and radical - radical reactions produce second - generation coms , etc .    as the temperature continues to rise ,",
    "the coms desorb thermally into the gas , where they can be detected .",
    "other mechanisms for desorption of coms include shock processes  @xcite , in regions such as the galactic center not closely associated with hot cores , and non - thermal processes operative at low temperatures , such as photodesorption  @xcite .",
    "the thermal mechanism can explain in a semi - quantitative sense most of the com observations in hot cores and corinos  @xcite .",
    "most of the radical - radical recombination reactions used in this model , however , have not been studied in the laboratory , and complications have been found .",
    "for example , the methoxy radical ( ch@xmath2o ) , used in the formation of methyl formate via surface recombination with the formyl radical ( hco ) , has not been found on ice surfaces in the synthesis of methanol from co , leading to the suggestion that it may be converted into the isomeric form ch@xmath3oh and not be available to react with other radicals  @xcite .",
    "of course , laboratory and interstellar time scales for surface reactions can be quite different ; nevertheless , more research is clearly needed to confirm the radical - radical mechanism .",
    "the recent detection of methyl formate and dimethyl ether in cold cores with temperatures as low as 10 k raises more serious questions about the general validity of the radical - radical mechanism to form coms  @xcite because radicals can diffuse only slowly if at all on ice mantles at 10 k , and so can not react efficiently with each other .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the studied sources are complex and the low resolution of single - dish telescopes might result in observations that mix both low temperature and higher temperature portions . in order to explain the recent detection of coms in cold cores ,  @xcite suggested that the coms are formed by precursors such as methanol which are first formed on grain surfaces at 10 k and then desorb to the gas phase via non - thermal mechanisms such as reactive desorption .",
    "even so , they found that it was necessary to add more gas - phase reactions such as radiative association to produce reasonable abundances of methyl formate and dimethyl ether .",
    "a more recent approach to the gas - phase chemistry by @xcite indicates that methyl formate can be formed in sufficient abundance via the gas - phase reaction @xmath4 moreover , they show that the ch@xmath2och@xmath3 radical is formed from dimethyl ether , leading to a correlation between the abundances of dimethyl ether and methyl formate .",
    "this correlation has been observed by  @xcite over a wide range of sources with differing conditions .",
    "however , a common problem of gas phase routes to form dimethyl ether is that gas phase methoxy abundances must be high enough in order to produce enough dimethyl ether  @xcite . given the low fractional abundance of gas phase methoxy ( @xmath5 ) observed in b1-b  @xcite , it is unclear that dimethyl ether can be formed solely in the gas phase in cold cores . for instance , in the standard model of @xcite , where the reactive desorption efficiency is set to be 0.01 and gas phase com formation reactions included , at the time when the calculated fractional abundances of dimethyl ether and methyl formate fit observations in b1-b , the fractional abundance of methoxy is more than one order of magnitude larger than the observed value .",
    "thus , even in cold cores where thermal desorption of coms is very inefficient , coms may also be formed appreciably on dust grains and then desorb into the gas phase via non - thermal processes .",
    "recently  @xcite suggested that the abundances of gas phase coms in cold and dense regions can be significantly enhanced by introducing eley - rideal and complex induced reaction mechanisms on dust grains .",
    "however , the simulated abundances of methyl formate in their models are still more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed values in both b1-b and l1689b .    in this paper",
    ", we employ a different mechanism to help explain the detection of coms in cold sources as well as the correlation of the abundances of methyl formate and dimethyl ether .",
    "our explanation is based on non - diffusive surface reactions , such as we and others considered for the case of co@xmath3 , which is one of the major components of ice mantles  @xcite .",
    "the most efficient formation mechanism to form co@xmath0 is the reaction co + oh @xmath6 co@xmath0 + h , although it does possess a significant barrier in the gas . in the laboratory , the surface analog appears to proceed via an eley - rideal mechanism , in which a gaseous co molecule lands on and reacts with a surface oh radical , formed via photodissociation of water @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this reaction in the interstellar medium has not been determined . another possible process to enable the co",
    "+ oh reaction is the so - called `` chain reaction '' mechanism , in which an o atom on a surface reacts diffusively with an h atom to form the oh radical , which can subsequently react with co without undergoing diffusion if a co molecule lies right below it  @xcite . without the initial reaction between o and h , the o atoms can not react efficiently with co since the process has a significant barrier . here",
    ", as discussed in  @xcite , we use the chain - reaction mechanism to produce coms on the top layers of ice mantles . note that chain reactions in our model are allowed to occur only if the radical - radical reactions are already in the network , so that it is possible that both this mechanism and a diffusive one can be operative , although the role of diffusion is limited for the production of coms at low temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , we show how dimethyl ether ( ch@xmath2och@xmath2 ) is formed via a chain reaction in which an h atom adds to a methylene ( ch@xmath3 ) radical on the surface to form a methyl ( ch@xmath2 ) radical , which then can react with a methoxy radical ( ch@xmath2o ) lying beneath the methyl radical .",
    "note also that the interstitial h atom shown in the figure ( see below for a discussion ) does not partake in the process .",
    "recently , we performed a unified microscopic - macroscopic monte carlo ( ummmc ) simulation using a full gas - grain reaction network with physical conditions pertaining to cold cores  @xcite .",
    "we found that moderate amounts of methyl formate and dimethyl ether could be formed on dust grains at temperatures as low as 10 k. the major non - thermal desorption mechanism considered was photodesorption ; however , it is not sufficiently efficient to drive a significant fraction of coms into the gas phase , so that most methyl formate and dimethyl ether remain on grain surfaces . in this paper",
    ", we report calculated gas phase abundances of coms in a cold core in a simulation that includes an efficient reactive desorption mechanism . in this mechanism ,",
    "the exothermicity of a surface reaction is used to drive the reaction product into the gas phase .",
    "in addition to this non - thermal desorption mechanism , we also include a number of improvements to the gas - phase network .",
    "the improved model is able to reproduce observed abundances of coms in cold sources as well as the strong correlation in abundances between methyl formate and dimethyl ether .",
    "we confine ourselves to a brief explanation of our simulation methods because they have been explained in detail in earlier papers  @xcite , after which our chemical models are introduced .      in our ummmc approach ,",
    "the kinetics that occurs on grains is handled by a microscopic approach , in which the position of all species is known , while the gas - phase kinetics is handled by a macroscopic approach  @xcite . in order to simulate chemical kinetics on a dust grain surface with @xmath7 binding sites",
    ", we put these @xmath7 sites on a @xmath8 square lattice where @xmath9 .",
    "nodes in the lattice that have both even numbered @xmath10 and @xmath11 coordinates are termed normal while nodes with both odd numbered @xmath10 and @xmath11 sites are termed interstitial .",
    "normal sites exist both on the surface of a dust grain and in the bulk of the ice , while interstitial sites exist only in the bulk .",
    "species on normal sites are called normal while species occupying interstitial sites are labeled interstitial .",
    "normal species on the topmost ( surface ) layer can hop from one normal site to another or desorb into the gas phase , while interstitial species can diffuse from one interstitial site to another in the bulk . the surface hopping rate @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) from one normal site to its nearest neighbor at temperature @xmath14 is determined by the surface diffusion barrier @xmath15 via the expression @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the trial frequency .",
    "similarly , the interstitial diffusion rate within the ice mantle is given by the expression @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the interstitial diffusion barrier while the thermal desorption rate is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the desorption energy .",
    "we set @xmath22 as in  @xcite .",
    "the formation of major species and coms on dust grain surfaces is found to be independent of the value of the interstitial diffusion barrier , @xmath19  @xcite , while the abundance of radicals which are formed in the ice by photodissociation and bulk diffusion of photodissociation products is strongly dependent on @xmath19 . because we only allow reactive desorption to occur on the topmost layer",
    ", the value of @xmath19 should not affect the abundance of gas phase coms when reactive desorption is included in the simulation .",
    "we choose a value , @xmath23 , which ensures that the interstitial diffusion rate is slower than the surface diffusion rate , while light species such as atomic h can still diffuse within the ice bulk .",
    "the desorption energy @xmath21 for each species on ice is taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hopping , interstitial diffusion , and thermal desorption are all modeled as poisson processes , so the time interval between two consecutive events is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a random number uniformly distributed within ( 0 , 1 ) while @xmath26 is the rate of hopping , interstitial diffusion or thermal desorption .",
    "a chemical reaction can occur when one reactive species hops into another site with a reactive species , or , in the chain reaction mechanism , a second reaction occurs between a newly formed species on the surface and one below it .",
    "interstitial species can also diffuse out of the ice mantle and become normal surface species  @xcite .",
    "photodissociation processes are modeled as outcomes of another poisson process , photon arrival .",
    "when photons arrive and strike the ice mantle , we keep track of the penetration of photons and decide whether photodissociation reactions can happen or not .",
    "the exponential nature of photon penetration is maintained in our simulation  @xcite .",
    "another possible outcome of photon arrival is photodesorption , which only occurs on the topmost 2 layers . in order to include the reactive desorption mechanism in the ummmc simulation , whenever a chemical reaction on the topmost layer occurs either diffusively or via a chain reaction",
    ", we generate a random number @xmath27 , which is uniformly distributed within ( 0 , 1 ) , and compare @xmath27 with a probability @xmath28 . if @xmath29 , then all products of the reaction will desorb into the gas phase , otherwise these products will remain on the ice mantle .",
    "products of chemical reactions within the ice mantle still remain in the bulk , as in  @xcite .",
    "the probability @xmath28 is the efficiency of reactive desorption , which is highly uncertain .",
    "on the other hand , it was found that @xmath30 is large enough to explain the observed gas - phase methanol abundance while @xmath31 is the highest value considered by  @xcite .",
    "we report simulation results from models with five different @xmath28 values , 0 , 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.05 and 0.1 .",
    "the chemical reaction network used is based on the gas - grain reaction network used in  @xcite .",
    "networks of this type can simulate both the gas - phase and grain - surface chemistry very well , and predict abundances of many classes of molecules accurately .",
    "in cold cores . therefore , in this paper , we will concentrate on species such as coms not treated by standard simulations , without discussing most other species in any detail .",
    "in particular , we emphasize methyl formate , dimethyl ether and acetaldehyde , which were found both in b1-b and l1689b @xcite , as well as the most ubiquitous com , methanol . although glycolaldehyde has not been found in cold cores so far , we still report the abundance of glycolaldehyde for comparison .",
    "moreover , h@xmath0co is a precursor of hcooch@xmath1 in some gas phase synthetic routes  @xcite , while the simulated abundance of h@xmath0co is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the observed value in b1-b  @xcite , so we also report the abundance of h@xmath0co in our models .",
    "the cosmic - ray ionization rate is set at @xmath32 s@xmath33 .",
    "the physical conditions pertain to the cold regions of dense clouds where methyl formate and dimethyl ether have been found  @xcite : the temperature is fixed at 10 k while the total proton density ( @xmath34 ) is @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio is fixed at @xmath37 , and the visual extinction @xmath38 .",
    "the major source of photons under these physical conditions occurs via the ionization of h@xmath3 by cosmic rays followed by electron excitation of h@xmath3 leading to photon emission @xcite .",
    "we start from bare grain surfaces and use the same initial gas phase abundances as in  @xcite , which are based on the assumption of low - metal abundances .",
    "we run each model 25 times up to a time of @xmath39 yr and take the average of these 25 simulation results so that the minimum non - zero fractional abundance of each species in the model is @xmath40 .",
    "the more important additional gas - phase chemical reactions are listed in table  [ table1 ] ; of these , a few have been studied at 10 k , while some of the reaction rate coefficients have been extrapolated from higher temperature values , and still others represent a higher degree of speculation . the important formation of methoxy in the gas - phase via the reaction between oh radical and methanol : @xmath41 is well studied @xcite .",
    "this reaction proceeds via an intermediate metastable van der vaals - type complex , ch@xmath1ohoh@xmath42 , which can redissociate into reactants or proceed to form the final products via tunneling .",
    "contrary to our earlier work  @xcite , we distinguish the methoxy and hydroxymethyl ( ch@xmath0oh ) radicals in this study .",
    "we include the new gas - phase reactions related to methoxy , dimethyl ether and methyl formate in  @xcite and @xcite except chemical reactions involving atomic fluorine because f can be quickly locked in the form of hf , so that cl atoms play the major role in converting ch@xmath1och@xmath1 to ch@xmath1och@xmath0 in the gas phase  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the additional gas - phase loss pathways of ch@xmath1o , h@xmath0co , ch@xmath1och@xmath0 , ch@xmath1cho and ch@xmath0oh in  @xcite are also included in our reaction network . because ch@xmath1o and ch@xmath1och@xmath0 are crucial for the gas phase synthesis of coms , we included destruction reactions of these two species by ions to complete the gas phase destruction pathways .",
    "the rate coefficients and products of ion - ch@xmath1o reactions are set to be the same as those for ion -ch@xmath0oh reactions , which already exist in our gas - grain network .",
    "similarly , the rate coefficients of ion - ch@xmath1och@xmath0 reactions are set to be the same as those of ion - ch@xmath1och@xmath1 reactions in our original gas grain network .",
    "we also introduced the channel ch@xmath1och@xmath1@xmath43 + e@xmath44 @xmath6 ch@xmath1och@xmath0 + h to complete the gas - phase formation routes of ch@xmath1och@xmath0 , and we have included the gas - phase , mainly destruction , reactions related to glycolaldehyde ( ch@xmath0ohcho ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that atomic c can react quickly with methanol at low temperatures and this reaction may be the major loss process in the gas phase when atomic c is abundant . we included this reaction in our reaction network .",
    "in addition , we included three reactions involving the radical ch and the species h@xmath3o , ch@xmath2oh , and h@xmath3co ; these are analogs of surface reactions which are shown in table  [ table20 ] .",
    ".some additional gas - phase reactions [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     there were also attempts to detect ethanol in b1-b  @xcite .",
    "however , ethanol has not been detected with a @xmath45 upper limit to its column density .",
    "we estimate the upper limit of the abundance of ethanol to be @xmath46 . at the time of best fit for b1-b , because ethanol can be efficiently formed on grain surfaces in our models other than m432 , simulated ethanol abundances in these models are around @xmath47 which is more than one order of magnitude larger than the upper limit of ethanol abundance in b1-b . on the other hand , because the surface synthesis of ethanol almost ceases due to the depletion of atomic gaseous c in model m432 at the time of best fit , our simulated ethanol abundance drops to @xmath48 , which is still somewhat larger than the upper limit to the abundance in b1-b .",
    "since our simulated ethanol abundances are above the observed upper limit , some important destruction mechanisms may be missing .",
    "one possibility is the destruction reaction with atomic carbon , which , although unstudied to the best of our knowledge , may be rapid because the analogous reaction involving methanol is rapid at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "if we assume the rate coefficient of c + c@xmath0h@xmath49oh to be the same as that of c + ch@xmath1oh at 10 k , i.e. , about @xmath47 @xmath50 s@xmath33 , then we can make an order of magnitude estimation of the significance of the reaction c + c@xmath0h@xmath49oh .",
    "the ion - ethanol destruction routes are the major destruction mechanism in our reaction network .",
    "because ethanol is polar , we estimate the ion - ethanol rate coefficient to be 10@xmath51 @xmath50 s@xmath33 .",
    "the total fractional abundance of destructive ions is about @xmath52 .",
    "so if the fractional abundance of c is greater than @xmath53 the c + c@xmath0h@xmath49oh reaction is the dominant destruction mechanism . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we can see that the c + c@xmath0h@xmath49oh reaction may be the major destruction mechanism before @xmath35 yr because gas phase c is sufficiently abundant before this time .",
    "however , after @xmath35 yr , the ion - ethanol reactions remain the major destruction routes of ethanol because gas phase c is severely depleted .",
    "our crude estimation can be confirmed by mc simulations .",
    "we included the reaction c + c@xmath0h@xmath49oh @xmath6 hco + c@xmath0h@xmath49 in the reaction network once again assuming the rate coefficient of c + c@xmath0h@xmath49oh to be the same as that of c + ch@xmath1oh at 10 k. we then ran models m43 and m432 again .",
    "the times of best fit are not altered by the new reaction .",
    "we found that at these times ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 yr for models m43 and m432 respectively ) , the abundance of ethanol drops to about 1.2@xmath56 in model m43 , which is below the observed upper limit while the abundance of ethanol in model m432 drops only slightly to 1.7@xmath57 , which is still above the observed upper limit in b1-b .",
    "nevertheless , the inclusion of the reaction between c and c@xmath3h@xmath58oh improves the agreement with observation .",
    "recently @xcite studied coms in l1544 .",
    "the fractional abundances of methanol and acetaldehyde were found to be @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "in addition , upper bounds were estimated for methoxy ( @xmath61 ) , methyl formate ( @xmath62 ) , and dimethyl ether ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the standard model of  @xcite , which sets @xmath30 and includes new gas phase com formation reactions , can reproduce the observed results in l1544 very well , while model b  @xcite can also reproduce observed results in l1544 except that the methanol abundance is about one order of magnitude lower than the observed value . at the times of",
    "best fit for b1-b , our models m432 and m43 can reproduce the methanol and acetaldehyde abundances in l1544 . moreover , the abundances of methoxy , methyl formate and dimethyl ether in models m432 and m43 lie below the upper limits of abundances of these species in l1544 .",
    "it was also recently found that there is a strong correlation between the abundances of methyl formate and dimethyl ether  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the abundance of methyl formate is almost linearly dependent on the abundance of dimethyl ether in various astronomical sources ranging over five orders of magnitude .",
    "it is argued that they may have the same precursor or one species may be the precursor of the other one .",
    "the standard model of  @xcite supports the second hypothesis if these two coms are formed solely in the gas phase .",
    "our models suggest that if they are formed on grain surfaces , then they have the same precursor .",
    "the radical ch@xmath0 is a precursor of dimethyl ether while ch is the precursor of methyl formate in our models .",
    "dimethyl ether is formed by the gradual hydrogenation of carbon atoms on top of ch@xmath1o while methyl formate is formed by hydrogenation of carbon atoms to ch on top of ch@xmath1o followed by the reaction between ch and o. the radical ch is a precursor of ch@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the abundances of radicals ch and ch@xmath0 are both dependent on gas phase c , so the strong correlation between the abundances of methyl formate and dimethyl ether can be explained via the primal precursor c. it is also found  @xcite that the correlation between the abundances of methyl formate and acetaldehyde is weak , which can be explained by the fact that the gas - phase synthesis of methyl formate requires different precursors from the gas phase synthesis of acetaldehyde .",
    "moreover , the formation mechanisms of acetaldehyde and methyl formate are not dependent on each other in the gas phase .",
    "we performed ummmc simulations with an efficient reactive desorption mechanism under physical conditions pertaining to cold cores , where coms were recently found .",
    "the observed abundances of gas phase coms and the methoxy radical in the cold cores l1689b and l1544 can be reproduced by our simulations at temperatures as low as 10 k while most observed gas phase com abundances in b1-b can also be reproduced without overestimating the methoxy abundance . moreover",
    ", our models can also explain the strong correlation between the abundances of hcooch@xmath1 and ch@xmath1och@xmath1 and the weak correlation between the abundances of hcooch@xmath1 and ch@xmath1cho .",
    "the problem of com formation in cold cores is linked to the problem of co@xmath0 formation on cold dust grains in our models .",
    "coms can be formed by the same type of chain reactions used to produce co@xmath3 under cold conditions where diffusion of large species does not occur .",
    "the co@xmath0 formation on cold dust grains by chain reactions was discussed in the introduction . moreover",
    ", the formation of surface methoxy on the topmost layer of an ice mantle also relies on this non - diffusive process .",
    "the success of our models further shows that non - diffusive chemical reactions should be included in surface reaction networks for better astrochemical modeling .",
    "such processes include our chain reaction mechanism as well as the eley - rideal and complex mechanisms advocated by @xcite .",
    "moreover , reactive desorption plays a key role in the non - thermal desorption of large molecules formed on dust grains .",
    "successful experiments on this process are adding to our understanding @xcite .",
    "experimental results from  @xcite show that reactive desorption efficiency is dependent on surface coverage and varies significantly depending on each specific reaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the reactive desorption efficiency of chain reactions has never been reported .",
    "chain reactions are different from single reactions in that they are combination of two reactions , which might enhance reactive desorption efficiency because the energy released by two reactions should be more than that by one single reaction",
    ". this effect could be important if the reactive desorption efficiency is low for a single reaction .",
    "more experimental work on reactive desorption should be undertaken to help explain com formation in cold astronomical sources .",

    "<S> the recent discovery of methyl formate and dimethyl ether in the gas phase of cold cores with temperatures as cold as 10 k challenges our previous astrochemical models concerning the formation of complex organic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the strong correlation between the abundances and distributions of methyl formate and dimethyl ether further shows that current astrochemical models may be missing important chemical processes in cold astronomical sources . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a scenario in which complex organic molecules and the methoxy radical can be formed on dust grains via a so - called `` chain reaction '' mechanism , in a similar manner to co@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a unified gas - grain microscopic - macroscopic monte carlo approach with both normal and interstitial sites for icy grain mantles is used to perform the chemical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> reactive desorption with varying degrees of efficiency is included to enhance the non - thermal desorption of species formed on cold dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , varying degrees of efficiency for the surface formation of methoxy are also included . </S>",
    "<S> the observed abundances of a variety of organic molecules in cold cores can be reproduced in our models . </S>",
    "<S> the strong correlation between the abundances of methyl formate and dimethyl ether in cold cores can also be explained . </S>",
    "<S> non - diffusive chemical reactions on dust grain surfaces may play a key role in the formation of some complex organic molecules . </S>"
