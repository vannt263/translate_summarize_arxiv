    "an exciting advance in recent years has been the increasing ability to observe and manipulate the dynamical processes of individual quantum systems . in this *  * endeavor , an important physical system has been a single atom strongly coupled to the electromagnetic field of a high-@xmath0 ( optical or microwave ) cavity within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) . @xcite here the coupling frequency of one atom to a single mode of an optical resonator is denoted by @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath2 is the one - photon rabi frequency ) , with the regime of strong coupling defined by the requirement that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the atomic decay rate to modes other than the cavity mode and @xmath5 is the decay rate of the cavity mode itself . in this circumstance ,",
    "the number of photons required to saturate an intracavity atom is @xmath6 and the number of atoms required to have an appreciable effect on the intracavity field is @xmath7 @xcite .    although there have been numerous laboratory advances which demonstrate the effect of strong coupling on the _ internal _ degrees of freedom of an atomic dipole coupled to the quantized cavity field ( i.e. , @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath4 ) , the consequences of strong coupling for the_external _ , atomic center - of - mass motion with kinetic energy @xmath10 have only recently been explored experimentally @xcite . in a regime of strong coupling for the _ external _ degrees of freedom , @xmath11 ,",
    "a single quantum is sufficient to profoundly alter the atomic center - of - mass ( cm ) motion , as an atom moves through a region of spatially varying coupling coefficient @xmath12 [ _ e.g. _ , as arises in the gaussian mode of a fabry - perot cavity , @xmath13 .    perhaps most strikingly",
    ", the spatial variation of the cavity mode can lead to a confining potential sufficient to trap an atom within the cavity mode even for a single quantum of excitation of the atom - cavity system , as first discussed in the work of refs.@xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 , which shows the the possibility for trapping by excitation to the lower component @xmath14 in the jaynes - cummings manifold of eigenstates",
    ".  modifications of the atomic cm dynamics can in turn significantly alter the cavity field .",
    "this situation is very different from the usual case for trapped atoms or ions in fixed external potentials , in that here the confining field and the atomic motion can be strongly interacting , in which case the overall state of the system must be determined in a self - consistent fashion .    the experimental requirements to investigate strong coupling for both the _ internal _ and _ external _ degrees of freedom are stringent [ namely , @xmath15 , and have required the integration of the techniques of laser cooling and trapping with those of cavity qed , as was initially achieved in 1996 @xcite and as illustrated in fig .  2",
    "mechanical effects due to strong coupling with single quanta were first observed in 1998 @xcite , in an experiment with peak coupling energy @xmath16  mk and with initial atomic kinetic energy @xmath17  k.    following this theme , two groups recently reported trapping of single atoms with intracavity fields at the single - photon level , beginning with the work of ref.@xcite and culminating in that of refs.@xcite . that such trapping might be possible in these experiments is indicated by the fact that the ratio @xmath18 of initial atomic kinetic energy @xmath10 to the coherent coupling energy @xmath19 , @xmath20 is less than unity .",
    "for the work in refs.@xcite , @xmath21 , while for that in ref.@xcite @xmath22 . although these ratios are indicative of the possibility of trapping with single quanta in cavity qed , the actual forces and confining potentials are somewhat more complex to analyze , as we shall see",
    ". moreover , beyond providing single - quantum forces sufficient for atomic localization , strong coupling also means that the presence of one atom can significantly modify the intracavity field , thereby providing a means to track atomic motion by way of the light emerging from the cavity .    to understand the basic scheme for trapping of single atoms with single quanta in cavity qed , consider the energies @xmath23  for the first excited states @xmath24 of the atom - cavity system .",
    "along the radial direction @xmath25 and for optimal @xmath26 ( standing - wave )  position , @xmath27 has the spatial dependence indicated in fig .  1 , which neglects dissipation .",
    "the ground state of the atom - cavity system is @xmath28 ; the atom is in its ground state @xmath29 , and there are no photons in the cavity .  for weak coupling ( atom far from the cavity mode center ) ,",
    "the first two excited states are that of one photon in the cavity and the atom in the ground state , @xmath30 , and of the atom in the excited state @xmath31 with no photons in the cavity , @xmath32 .",
    "these two states are separated by an energy @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the detuning between the `` bare '' ( uncoupled ) atom and cavity resonances .    as an atom enters the cavity along @xmath35 it encounters the spatially varying mode of the cavity field , and hence a spatially varying interaction energy @xmath36 , given by @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the bare states map via this coupling to the dressed states @xmath24 shown in the figure , with energies @xmath39^{1/2}.\\ ] ] our interest is in the state @xmath14 ; the spatial dependence of the energy @xmath40 represents a pseudopotential well that can be selectively populated by our choice of driving field @xmath41 and @xmath42 to trap the atom , as first suggested by parkins@xcite .",
    "the system is monitored with a weak probe beam as an atom enters the cavity mode ; detection of an atom transit signal triggers an increase in driving strength to populate the state @xmath14 and trap the atom .",
    "because the experiments in the optical domain have atomic and cavity decay times ( @xmath43 ) that are small compared to the time @xmath44 for motion through the cavity field , the atom - cavity system must be continually re - excited by way of @xmath45 , thereby providing an effective pseudopotential on time scales @xmath46 such that ( @xmath47)@xmath48 .",
    "although a full theory based on the preceding discussion is _ sufficient _ to provide detailed agreement with the experimental observations of refs .",
    "@xcite ( as we shall show in subsequent sections ) , it is reasonable to ask to what extent such a theory based on the interactions in cavity qed  is _ necessary_. in particular , it might well be that the well - established theory of laser cooling and trapping in free space@xcite could provide an adequate description of the potentials and heating rates , with the cavity merely providing a convenient means for attaining a strong drive field .",
    "with respect to the experimental results of pinkse _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , we find that this is in fact largely the case ; there are only small quantitative distinctions between the free - space theory and the appropriate quantum theory . one interesting feature to note in this experiment is enhanced cooling of the atomic motion relative to the parameters of hood",
    "_ et al._@xcite .",
    "this effect , which enables trapping in this parameter regime , arises through cavity - mediated cooling @xcite . for these parameters , the average localization time from simulations",
    "is extended by 75% relative to the equivalent free - atom signal ; both these times are shorter than the time for an atom to transit freely through the cavity .",
    "by contrast , in the regime of the experiment of hood _",
    "( ref.@xcite ) , the cavity qed interactions result in a strong suppression of dipole heating along the cavity axis relative to the free - space theory , which has a strong effect on both the duration and character of the observed atom transits . in the cavity qed setting it becomes possible to create a potential deep enough to trap an atom without simultaneously introducing heating rates that cause rapid escape from that potential . for these parameters ,",
    "the average experimentally observed localization time is a factor of 3.5 longer than the equivalent free - atom average .",
    "the results of extensive numerical simulations of trapping times and radial oscillation frequencies , and their validation by way of comparisons to experimentally measured distributions , demonstrate the essential role of the single - photon trapping mechanism in the experiment of ref.@xcite . at root",
    "is the distinction between the nonlinear response of an atom in free space and one strongly coupled to an optical cavity . for these experimental parameters , the eigenvalue structure of fig .  1 leads to profound differences between the standard theory of laser cooling and trapping , and the extension of this theory to the regime of strong coupling in cavity qed .",
    "note that prior experiments in our group have confirmed that the full quantum treatment of the one - atom master equation in cavity qed is required for a description of the dynamics associated with the internal degrees of freedom for a single atom in an optical cavity in the regime @xmath49 .",
    "these experimental confirmations come by way of measurements of the nonlinear susceptibility for the coupled system in settings close to that for the experiment of ref.@xcite@xcite .",
    "a principal goal of this paper is to investigate the extent to which a theory of atomic motion within the setting of cavity qed is likewise a _",
    "necessary _ component in describing the center - of - mass dynamics for the experiments of refs.@xcite .",
    "a second goal is to examine the related question of the extent to which inferences about atomic motion within the cavity can be drawn from real - time observations of the cavity field , either via photon counting @xcite or heterodyne detection @xcite of the cavity output .",
    "the interactions in cavity qed  bring an _ in principle _ enhancement in the ability to sense atomic motion beyond that which is otherwise possible in free space . stated more quantitatively",
    ", the ability to sense atomic motion within an optical cavity by way of the transmitted field can be characterized by the optical information  @xmath50 , which , roughly speaking , is the maximum possible number of photons that can be collected as signal in time @xmath51 with efficiency @xmath52  as an atom transits between a region of optimal coupling @xmath1 and one with @xmath53 .",
    "a key enabling aspect of the experiments in refs.@xcite is that @xmath54 , leading to information about atomic motion at a rate that far exceeds that from either cavity or spontaneous decay ( as in fluorescence imaging ) . in practice , for detection strategies employed experimentally ,",
    "information is extracted at a somewhat lower rate .",
    "for example , in the experiment of hood et al .",
    "@xcite , the photon count rate would be @xmath55s@xmath56 ( including the overall escape and detection efficiency @xmath57 ) , while for the experiment of pinkse et al.@xcite it is @xmath58s@xmath56 ( including an estimated overall escape and detection efficiency @xmath59)@xcite . for time scales",
    "@xmath60  s as relevant to the following discussion , atomic motion through the spatially varying cavity mode leads to variations in the transmitted field that can be recorded with a high signal - to - noise ratio , namely , a signal of @xmath61 photons for the experiment of hood et al . and @xmath62 for that of pinkse et al .",
    ", where each is calculated for an intracavity field strength of one photon .",
    "the value of the optical information itself does not tell the complete story . for cavity qed  experiments like those considered here ,",
    "one records either the sequence of photoelectric counts or the heterodyne current versus time , from which necessarily only limited inferences about atomic motion can be drawn .",
    "however , if center - of - mass dynamics ( i.e. , axial and radial motions ) occur on well - separated time scales , then it is reasonable to suggest that appropriate signal processing techniques could extract information about these motions from the single time sequence of the photocurrent @xmath63 .",
    "such processing could presumably occur in real time if @xmath64 is much faster than the rates for radial and axial motion [ e.g. , the oscillation frequencies @xmath65 in a potential well , with @xmath66 .",
    "unfortunately , in neither experiment @xcite is @xmath67 large enough to resolve the axial dynamics directly , so the task of disentangling the radial and axial motion signals becomes more difficult , and theoretical simulations of the experiment become useful in understanding the nature of the observed transmission signals .",
    "this difficulty arises in the experimental regime of pinkse et al.@xcite .",
    "for these parameters , axial heating leads to frequent bursts of large - amplitude motion along the cavity axis , with envelopes extending over time scales comparable to those for radial motion .",
    "consequently , at experimental bandwidths ( averaging times ) , both types of motion give rise to qualitatively similar modulations in the measured transmission signal .",
    "furthermore , motion in the radial direction has a strong diffusive component , giving rise to a wide spread of time scales for radial motion .",
    "our simulations discussed in sec .",
    "v suggest that for these parameters , short - time - scale modulations ( @xmath68  @xmath69s )  tend to be mostly due to bandwidth averaging over axial motion , while longer ( @xmath70  @xmath69 s ) variations such as presented in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite typically reflect radial motion , though these long - time - scale variations are generally modified in amplitude by the presence of axial motion .",
    "modulations on intermediate time scales appear ambiguous in their dynamical origin .",
    "by contrast , as shown in ref.@xcite , for the parameters of hood et al .",
    "atoms are well localized along the standing - wave direction throughout most of the trapping interval , with axial motion giving rise to negligible signal until finally rapid axial heating leads to atomic escape .",
    "consequently , observed variations in the photocurrent @xmath63 are simpler than those of ref .",
    "@xcite , and directly yield the radial atomic position .",
    "furthermore , in this experiment the radial oscillation frequency is large compared to the spontaneous emission heating rate , meaning that the resulting atomic motion is largely conservative ( rather than diffusive )  in nature , taking place in a known potential ( as demonstrated both experimentally and by way of numerical simulation ) .",
    "hence , from @xmath63 it becomes possible to make detailed inferences about the radial motion , even to the point of real - time observations of the anharmonic motion of a single atom and of the reconstruction of actual atomic trajectories .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "following this introduction , in sec .",
    "ii we present a detailed description of our theoretical model and its use for the implementation of numerical simulations .",
    "section iiicompares effective potentials and momentum diffusion rates derived for the two experiments , along with their analogs for the hypothetical case of an equal - intensity free - space trap .",
    "these calculations explore the distinction between quantum and classical , and also give insight into the nature of atomic motion expected in both experiments .",
    "sample simulated trajectories are presented for both cases .  in sec .",
    "iv we present experimental and simulation results for the case of hood et al .",
    ", which serve both to verify the simulations and also to demonstrate important features of the resulting motion .",
    "v  gives the application of the same tools to analyze the experiment of pinkse et al . ; we see that standing - wave motion and diffusive radial motion complicate the correlation between atomic position and detected field in this case .",
    "finally , axial motion is explored in more depth , and fourier analysis of our simulations show that oscillations of comparable amplitude and frequency should be visible for both atoms confined ( but heated )  within a well , and atoms skipping along the standing wave .",
    "the theoretical treatment and numerical simulation of the motion of a single atom strongly coupled to an optical cavity , as described in sec .",
    "ii , lead to a surprisingly rich range of often qualitatively different dynamics . the motion may be essentially conservative and tightly confined around antinodes of the standing wave , or essentially dissipative and diffusive and involve interesting flights between different potential wells of the standing wave .",
    "indeed we find that the existing experimental results of hood _ et al . _ and pinkse _ et al .",
    "_ exemplify these very different dynamical regimes .",
    "key features of the atomic motion in both experimental regimes are addressed as follows :    figures 35 and their associated discussion in sec .",
    "iii elucidate the nature of the trapping potential and momentum diffusion in an optical cavity as opposed to a free space standing wave .",
    "in particular we find that , even when the atom - cavity system is strongly coupled and driven such that it has a mean intracavity photon number of roughly @xmath71 , the trapping potential and momentum diffusion may be only slightly different from those in a free - space standing wave , and in fact this is the case for the parameters of pinkse _",
    "et al_. on the other hand , for the parameters of hood _",
    "et al . _ the usual fluctuations of the dipole force along the standing wave are suppressed by an order of magnitude , which to our knowledge represents qualitatively new physics for optical forces at the single - photon level within the context of cavity qed .",
    "we show that in the parameter regime of pinkse _ et al . _",
    "the heating rates are such that the atom could be expected to gain energy equal to a significant fraction of the total trapping potential during a single motional oscillation period for both axial and radial motion . by this measure the heating rates in the experiment of hood _",
    "_ are much slower , indicating more nearly conservative motion , and this could be expected to have a profound effect on the qualitative nature of the dynamics in the two experiments .",
    "figures 6 and 7 and the corresponding text in sec .",
    "iiipresent simulated transits for both experiments , and discuss the qualitative features of atomic dynamics in both cases . for the parameter regime of hood _ al .",
    "_ , conservative radial motion dominates diffusion and standing - wave motion , with atomic trajectories localized at peaks of a single standing - wave antinode .",
    "atoms trapped with the mean trapping time execute several radial orbits .",
    "the eventual escape is typically due to heating along the cavity axis .",
    "by contrast , for the experiment of pinkse _ et al .",
    "_ , a trajectory of typical duration , as in fig .",
    "7(a ) , does not experience a complete radial orbit and in fact resembles a scattering event , with a large contribution from radial diffusion as well .",
    "for these events the observed localization time is comparable to the time for free flight through the cavity .",
    "axially the simulations show that in longer duration transits the atom frequently skips between wells of the standing - wave potential due to repeated heating and recooling .",
    "section iv , with figs . 810 , presents a more detailed and quantitative investigation of trapping and motional dynamics for the experiment of hood et al . the ability of our simulations to closely reproduce the mean trapping times observed in the experiment provides evidence of their accuracy and utility . as illustrated in fig .",
    "9 , the triggering strategy leads to significant modifications of the distribution of residence times within the cavity .",
    "the essentially conservative nature of the dynamics and the strong axial confinement make it possible to confidently ascribe oscillations in the transmitted intensity to radial motion of the atom . as shown in fig .",
    "10 , the experimentally observed oscillations are consistent with the calculated potential .",
    "the conservative nature of the motion is further confirmed by the separation of orbital periods by angular momentum that is also apparent in this figure .",
    "section v , with figs .",
    "1115 , presents a detailed analysis of trapping and motional dynamics for the experiment of pinkse et al .",
    "again , our simulations are sufficient to reproduce the reported mean localization time . in this case",
    ", the triggering strategy leads to relatively minor modifications of the distribution of residence times for an atom within the cavity . in this case",
    "the dissipative nature of the evolution is significant ; essentially no long - term localization is observed if the sign of the friction coefficient is reversed , whereas this has little effect in the parameter regime of hood _",
    "these largely dissipative and diffusive motional dynamics are found to have significant effect on the information about the motion that is available in the transmitted field .",
    "for those events with a long localization time , the axial motion of the atom is repeatedly heated and cooled , resulting in slow variations in envelope of the amplitude of the rapid oscillations of the transmitted light . the time scale of these variations is comparable to that for radial motion of the atom .",
    "there are thus no unambiguous signatures for radial motion and only longer time scale excursions of the atom in the radial potential lead to variations of the output field that may be confidently ascribed to the radial motion . likewise , although information about axial motion is also available in the output light , we find that it is in general difficult to distinguish large oscillations in a single well of the axial potential from free flight over several wells as attempted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we outline the derivation from the full quantum - mechanical master equation of the `` semiclassical model '' for the atomic motion used in ref .",
    "it turns out that this model is able to reproduce the experimental observations very accurately .",
    "note that here the term `` semiclassical '' refers to approximations with respect to the atomic center - of - mass motion , and not to the internal degrees of freedom , for which the full quantum character is retained .",
    "this situation should not be confused with the semiclassical theory of cavity qed for which expectation values of field operators @xmath72 and atomic operators @xmath72 are assumed to factorize , @xmath73 ; no such approximation is made here . to distinguish these two cases",
    ", we introduce the term _ quasiclassical _ for the case of atomic motion .",
    "the validity of the quasiclassical model depends on a separation of time scales between the atomic motion and the cavity and internal atomic dynamics .",
    "we adapt the work of dalibard and cohen - tannoudji  @xcite to the situation of a quantized cavity mode .",
    "a similar derivation in the bad - cavity limit appears in  @xcite .",
    "the details of the derivation are essentially unchanged from free space , since the terms of the master equation which refer to the dynamics of the cavity have no explicit dependence on the operators describing the atomic motion .",
    "however , we do find conditions for the validity of the approximation for this system which depend on the properties of the cavity .",
    "finally , we describe in more detail the numerical simulations of the resulting model first presented in ref .",
    "these simulations are of the kind discussed in refs.@xcite .    an analytical calculation of force , momentum diffusion and friction coefficients for the quasiclassical model of atomic motion in the low driving limit was derived by horak and co - workers  @xcite , who found a regime in which the steady - state temperature scaled as the cavity decay rate .",
    "this allows cooling of the atom below the doppler limit , so long as the cavity can be made to have lower loss than the atom .",
    "the parameters of refs.@xcite are very far from this low driving limit .",
    "hence we employ numerical techniques based on solving the appropriate master equations by expansions in terms of fock states of the cavity field  @xcite .",
    "note that a very early contribution developed a different theoretical framework and numerical scheme for calculating the force and friction ( but not the momentum diffusion ) of an atom in a cavity ( or `` colored vacuum '' )  @xcite .",
    "very recently , vuletic and chu  @xcite found cavity - mediated cooling in a slightly different regime to that considered by horak _",

    "the hamiltonian for a two - level atom interacting with a single mode of the electromagnetic field in an optical cavity using the electric dipole and rotating - wave approximations ( in the interaction picture with respect to the laser frequency ) is @xmath74 this is the familiar jaynes - cummings hamiltonian modified to take into account the external degrees of freedom of the atom and the spatial variation of the cavity mode .",
    "the first term is the kinetic energy of the atom , and the next two terms are the energy in the internal state of the atom and the cavity excitation .",
    "the fourth term describes the position - dependent interaction of the cavity mode and the atomic dipole .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are operators .",
    "thus , for example , the exact strength of the coupling between the atomic internal state and the cavity field depends on the shape of the atomic wave packet , which is in turn determined by the mechanical effects of the cavity field .",

    "it is possible to eliminate the internal and cavity dynamics adiabatically in favor of the slower dynamics of the motional state in parameter regimes of direct relevance to current experiments .",
    "intuitively , for the quasiclassical approximation to work , the state of the atom needs to be sufficiently localized in position and momentum on the scales important to the problem so that it can be thought of as a classical particle .",
    "the conditions for adiabatically eliminating the internal and cavity dynamics roughly correspond to this idea .",
    "it turns out that it is necessary first that exchanges of momentum with either the cavity field or by spontaneous emission into free space should result in momentum kicks that are small compared with the momentum spread @xmath84 of the atomic wigner function , thus @xmath85 for an atom which is in a minimum uncertainty state with respect to the position - momentum heisenberg inequality this requires that the state is localized to better than a wavelength . the atomic motional state will in general",
    "be a mixture allowing the position spread to be broader .",
    "however , this requirement means that the motional state can be thought of as a probabilistic mixture of pure states localized to within a wavelength , and so places a limit on the coherence length of the motional state  @xcite .",
    "second it is important that the range of doppler shifts of the atom due to its momentum spread is small compared to the atomic and cavity linewidths , thus @xmath86 in this paper it will be assumed that the root - mean - square atomic momentum obeys this inequality , thus making a low velocity approximation , but the arguments here can in fact be generalized to arbitrary mean velocities of the atom  @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg inequality means that this also requires a minimum position spread of the atom @xmath87 these criteria are a simple generalization of the situation for laser cooling in free space which can be imagined as the situation @xmath88 .",
    "the consistency of these conditions , which effectively put lower and upper limits on the atomic momentum spread , requires that @xmath89 the first of these conditions is well known for laser cooling in free space  the requirement that the recoil energy of the atomic transition be much lower than the doppler energy , which effectively controls the limiting temperature of the laser cooling . this condition is well satisfied for heavy atoms such as cesium and rubidium and the optical transitions employed in cavity qed experiments considered here .",
    "the analogous condition brought about by the cavity dynamics requires that the recoil energy associated with exchanging excitation with the cavity field is much smaller than the energy width of the cavity resonance .",

    "the force and momentum diffusion coefficient for the cavity system were calculated according to the formulas described above by numerical techniques based on ref.@xcite .",
    "the field state is expanded in terms of number states , and truncated at an appropriate level and a matrix - continued fraction algorithm is used to calculate @xmath110 .",
    "the axial potentials and heating rates have @xmath137  nm periodicity inherited from the standing - wave field strength .",
    "observe that the axial heating rates have minima at both field antinodes and field nodes .",
    "the first thing to note is that the axial and radial heating rates are very different . in the radial direction ,",
    "heating is dominated by diffusion due to spontaneous - emission recoils .",
    "axially , however , the reactive or dipole fluctuation component of the diffusion dominates .",
    "this is because the reactive component is proportional to the gradient of the field squared , which is much larger for the axial direction where variations are greater ( by a factor of @xmath138 ) .",
    "this contribution also has the property that it does not saturate with the atomic response .",
    "it is already clear that it should be possible to trap individual atoms , since the potential depth of roughly 2.5 mk is greater than the initial energy of the atoms in the experiment ( around 0.46 mk ) and the heating rate in the radial potential is relatively slow . over 50 @xmath139s ( a time scale over which the atomic motion is strongly affected by the potential )",
    "the total heating will typically still be small compared to the depth of the potential .",
    "however , the importance of the quantum character of the relevant fields or phenomena is not ensured by the statement that trapping occurs with a mean field strength of @xmath140 photon , since this is trivially the case in an equivalent free - space volume for a field of the same intensity as that inside the cavity .    in order to see whether a full quantum description of the atom - cavity is necessary in order",

    "3 also shows the values calculated for an atom in an equivalent free - space standing wave , calculated by standard techniques@xcite .",
    "this free - space standing wave has the same geometry as the cavity mode , and the same peak field strength @xmath141 the detuning between the free - space field and the atom is chosen to be @xmath142 .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the only large difference between the two models is in the axial heating rate , where a strong suppression of the axial heating is seen in the quantum calculation .",
    "this suppression is an effect of the quantized nature of the intracavity field .",
    "the self - consistent coupling of the cavity field and atomic position ( in a semiclassical sense )  can not explain this suppression ; in fact , by itself this coupling would lead to an increase in diffusion over the free - space case , since the atomic motion within the cavity induces steeper gradients in the field .",
    "the suppression  of diffusion is then evidence that it is necessary to use a fully quantum description , and speak of single photons rather than classical fields for these experimental parameters . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this suppression of the axial heating was essential for the trapping of atoms in the cavity .",
    "thus for these experimental parameters , the eigenvalue structure of fig .  1 leads to profound differences between the standard theory of laser cooling and trapping and the extension of this theory to the regime of strong coupling in cavity qed .    by way of comparison ,",
    "the same quantities are plotted for the parameters relevant to pinkse _",
    "et al._@xcite in fig .",
    ". the smaller value of @xmath1 in this experiment leads to a smaller effective potential , since the spatial gradients of the dressed state energy levels ( which lead to the potential ) are proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "more importantly , the diffusion values calculated from the full quantum model discussed above are now little different from those of the equivalent free - space standing wave .",
    "this lack of a clear difference in potentials or diffusion indicates that the quantized nature of the field is not required to explain the radial trapping observed in ref .",
    "note that the resulting axial heating rates are essentially the same as those of ref .",
    "@xcite in absolute magnitude ; however , in ref .",
    "@xcite the potential was made deeper _ without _ the expected corresponding  increase in diffusion .",
    "for the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite one additional interesting feature appears  enhanced cooling of the atom motion relative to the parameters of ref .",
    "this arises through cavity - mediated cooling @xcite , and as we shall see , has an important effect on the axial dynamics of atoms in the experiment of @xcite .",
    "we now wish to use these potentials and heating rates to gain an intuitive understanding of the character of atomic motion that we would expect to observe in each case .",
    "in particular , we are interested in exploring the degree to which the atomic motion in the potential can be close to conservative motion , or likewise the degree to which it could be dominated by diffusion .",
    "the time scales of relevance to the conservative motion may be characterized by the period associated with small - amplitude oscillations in the bottom of the axial ( @xmath143 ) and radial ( @xmath144 ) potential wells",
    ". if the energy changes only by a small fraction ( relative to the the total well depth @xmath145 ) on this time scale , motion will be nearly conservative .",
    "5 plots the potentials and heating rates for the two cases in this new set of scaled units ; heating rates are expressed as an energy increase per oscillation period , as a fraction of @xmath145 ( note as the atom heats and explores the anharmonicity of the potential , this only lengthens the period of oscillation ) .",
    "interestingly , we see a clear qualitative difference in the nature of the atomic motional dynamics . for the parameters of hood",
    "et al . , in the radial plane spontaneous emission only gives small perturbations to the energy over the time scale of single orbits , and motion is nearly conservative .",
    "we note that this low level of diffusion enabled the reconstructions of single - atom trajectories in ref .",
    "@xcite , for which the small changes in angular momentum could be accurately tracked .",
    "a quite different regime is found for the parameters of pinkse _ et al . , _ where the radial atomic motion is strongly affected by heating from spontaneous emission kicks .",
    "here an average atom gains an energy of nearly half the well depth in what would be a radial orbit time , adding a large diffusive component to the motion .",
    "this same scaling shows that the axial heating rate is also much more rapid on the scale of the potential in ref .",
    "@xcite , which suggests that the atom will more quickly escape its confinement near an antinode and begin to skip along the standing wave .",
    "the qualitative understanding of the atomic motion gained here is borne out by the simulations of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , and is explored in more detail in the simulations to follow .",
    "simulations of the kind described in sec .",
    "ii were performed for the parameters of the two experiments , and individual instances of these simulations give insight into the dynamics of the motion  for example , the relative significance of conservative or dissipative dynamics  and the correlation between atomic motion and the cavity field state , which is in turn measured by detection of the output field .",
    "ensembles of these trajectories provide the statistics of the motion described by the fokker - planck equation [ eq .  [ eq : fokker ] ] which may then be used to provide histograms of transit times to compare to the experimental data or to test reconstruction algorithms for the motion . in order to approximate the experiment as closely as possible",
    ", some effort was made to match the detailed experimental conditions .",
    "the two general considerations were to reasonably accurately estimate the initial distribution of atomic positions and momenta for atoms and to consider detection noise and bandwidth when simulating the feedback switching of the probe laser power .",
    "for each trajectory in the simulations , initial atomic position and momentum values were drawn from a probability distribution , which was chosen to correspond to the cloud of atoms following laser cooling and then free fall @xcite or launching by an atomic fountain @xcite to the cavity mirrors . in the simulations ,",
    "all the atoms started in a horizontal plane @xmath71 @xmath146 mode waists above or below the center of the cavity mode , where mechanical effects on the atom are negligible .",
    "since the mot from which the atoms are falling or rising has dimensions much larger than the cavity mode , the initial position in the axial direction was chosen from a flat distribution over the cavity mode , and the initial position along the @xmath147 axis was also chosen from a flat distribution over 1 @xmath148 mode waists on either side of the mode center  this distance could be modified but atoms that are far out in the mode radially do not typically cause large increases in the cavity transmission , and therefore do not trigger the feedback .",
    "the velocity of the atom along the cavity axis is limited by the fact that it must not hit one of the mirrors while falling toward the cavity , and this was also chosen from a flat distribution where the speed was not more than 0.46 cm / s for the cavity of hood et al.@xcite . although the two experiments have rather different geometries , we estimate that this consideration leads to a very similar limiting velocity for motion along the axis . in the experiment of pinkse et al.@xcite",
    ", we used 0.4 cm / s .",
    "the velocity along the @xmath149 axis was chosen from a gaussian distribution appropriate to the temperature of the mot ( @xmath150 @xmath151 ) after polarization gradient cooling .",
    "for @xcite the velocities in the vertical direction were chosen by calculating as appropriate for an atom falling freely from the mot ( the mot  is situated 3.2 mm above the mode with a spatial extent of standard deviation 0.6 mm ) .",
    "thus atoms arriving at the cavity axis have a mean vertical velocity @xmath152@xmath153s .",
    "some of these parameters such as the height , size and temperature of the initial mot  are not precisely known for the experiment , so that some consideration of the variation of the histograms and other features of the resulting simulations has been made although no systematic optimization in order to obtain the best agreement has been undertaken . in ref .",
    "@xcite the mean initial vertical velocity of atoms entering the cavity is @xmath154 cm / s .",
    "this speed is very much less than the mean velocity imparted to the atoms by the pushing beam which launches them from the mot @xmath155 cm below , and as a result the atoms are all near the top of their trajectories .",
    "simple kinematical calculations show that the resulting distribution of velocities should be rather broad compared to the mean . in the absence of more detailed information about the mottemperature and spatial size and the strength of the pushing beam we choose the initial vertical velocity distribution to be a gaussian of mean 20 cm / s and standard deviation 10 cm / s ",
    "this leads to a distribution of trapping times with a mean that matches the mean reported in ref .",
    "each trajectory proceeds until the atom is either a greater radial distance from the center of the mode than it started from , or it has moved sufficiently far in the axial direction that it would hit one of the cavity mirrors .",
    "the detection and triggering are modeled as follows . in the parameter range",
    "in which the `` quasiclassical '' model is valid , the cavity field comes to equilibrium with the atomic position on a time scale much faster than the atomic motion itself , and thus the light transmitted through the cavity ( over bandwidths of the order of tens to hundreds of kilohertz ) is associated with the atomic motion . at each point in the simulation",
    "the intracavity field and intensity expectation values are stored in order to record for each trajectory a noiseless and infinite - bandwidth trace . in practice",
    ", experimental traces will look like filtered and noisy versions of these traces . as an atom enters the cavity mode ,",
    "a weak driving field is present for probing .  in order to model the triggering step , the field intensity @xmath156 or field amplitude modulus squared @xmath157",
    "is averaged over a time equal to the bandwidth of the detection in the case of heterodyne detection as in ref .",
    "@xcite , or over the time windows in which photocounts are binned in the case of direct photodetection as in ref .",
    "@xcite . a random number with the appropriate variance to represent the shot noise",
    "is added and the total is compared with some predecided level  if the transmission exceeds this level the probe laser beam is increased in strength in order to attempt to trap the atom . in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite the trigger level is @xmath158 0.32 , the averaging time is 9 @xmath139s , and there is a 2-@xmath139s delay between triggering and changing the driving laser power . for the experimental bandwidth of 100 khz",
    ", the appropriate noise has standard deviation 0.05 at a transmitted signal of 0.32 .",
    "these parameters are chosen so as to match as closely as possible the conditions of the experiment .",
    "the same procedure is followed for simulations of the parameters @xcite . although the exact triggering protocol is not described there , we assumed that counts over a period of @xmath159 @xmath139s were used to decide whether or not to trigger and the noise was chosen to be consistent with the reported photon count rate of @xmath160s@xmath161 @xcite .",
    "examples of such trajectories are plotted for the parameters of ref.@xcite in fig .  6 and for those of ref .",
    "@xcite in fig",
    "the chosen trajectories range in length from the experimentally reported mean transit time upward , and are chosen because they show typical features of the dynamics in each case .",
    "it is clear that the two experiments are in quite different parameter regimes , as already indicated by the relative sizes of the potentials and heating rates .    for the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , the atoms orbit in a radial plane ; some have nearly circular and some very eccentric orbits .",
    "the motion along the axial direction is usually well localized near an antinode of the standing wave , where the axial heating rate is small .",
    "this localization occurs because atoms are channeled into the antinodes by the weak potential associated with the initial probing field , which slowly begins to affect an atom as it falls across the mode waist during the detection stage of the experiment .",
    "however the strong axial heating that is present away from the antinodes means that once an atom begins to heat axially , it suffers a burst of heating ( over several hundred microseconds ) , which leads to its loss from the potential well associated with a single antinode of the field .",
    "frequently the atom leaves an axial potential well when it is radially far from the center of the cavity mode , since in this case the axial potential becomes weaker .",
    "note that the mean transit time in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to @xmath162 radial orbits around the center of the cavity mode , so transits with multiple oscillations are frequently observed . in ref .",
    "@xcite the radial oscillation frequency is slower , so an atom of mean transit time does not in fact make a complete rotation about the mode center .",
    "the radial motion in this case is also visibly more stochastic in nature , as a result of the relatively faster spontaneous emission momentum diffusion discussed above .",
    "another interesting difference between the two parameter regimes is , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relative importance of atomic motion along the standing wave as opposed to oscillations around a single antinode . in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , long , strongly trapped transits almost always involve intervals when an atom is skipping along the standing wave , as well as intervals when it is oscillating in an individual well .",
    "by contrast , for the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , only a few percent of trajectories involve skipping during times in which the atom is trapped , and this is usually associated with movement over one or two wells with the atom falling back into the adjacent or a nearby well .",
    "this happens so quickly that it does not affect the radial motion in practice , or lead to a detectable signal in the output light , so that these rare events of skipping do not affect the reconstructions of ref .",
    "@xcite .    as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the axial motion often becomes more significant at the end of a transit and as the atom is leaving the mode , which leads to atoms skipping a well in perhaps as many as one in five cases at the end of the transit .",
    "we find from the simulations that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first escape time from an axial potential well for an atom initially localized near an antinode is sufficiently short compared to the mean trapping time that skipping along the wells almost always takes place . on the other hand ,",
    "the first escape time is of the order of several times the mean trapping time for the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , so skipping between standing wells is correspondingly rare .",
    "it is interesting to note that the friction coefficient for the parameters of pinkse _ et al . _",
    "is much more significant than for the experiment of hood _",
    "_ , and plays an important role in the axial motion of the atom . as in the trajectories shown here",
    "it is a feature of essentially every trajectory for the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite that the atom spends time in potential wells associated with several different antinodes of the field .",
    "however , we performed simulations with the sign of the friction coefficient reversed , and found that no more than a few percent of trajectories were recaptured in a second well after having begun to skip along the standing wave .",
    "clearly the dissipative nature of the motion is an integral feature of the dynamics in this regime , and in particular it enables the atoms to fall back into axial potential wells after escape due to the rapid heating in that dimension .",
    "having presented the theoretical basis underlying the simulated atom trajectories , in this section we present results of these simulations and their comparison with experimental results as reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "we generate a set of simulated trajectories for the parameters @xmath163 mhz with detuning parameters @xmath164 mhz and @xmath165 mhz . in correspondence with the experimental protocol ,",
    "the initial pretriggering level of the driving laser gives a 0.05-photon mean - field strength in the empty cavity ; when this level rises to 0.32 photons indicating the presence of an atom , we trigger a sixfold increase in the driving strength to a trapping level of a 0.3-photon empty - cavity mean field strength .",
    "a close correspondence between theory and experiment is obtained for these results , demonstrating the relevance of this theoretical model to the physics of the actual experiment .",
    "in addition , both theoretical and experimental results exhibit features which are relevant to building up a picture of the nature of the single - atom , single - photon trapping and atomic dynamics , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "we begin by presenting the qualitative similarity of experimental and simulated atom transit signals , as observed via detection of cavity transmission as a function of time .",
    "8 shows two sample experimental transits [ ( a ) and ( b ) ] and two sample simulated transits [ ( c ) and ( d ) ] . for the simulated transits , traces of the corresponding radial and axial motion",
    "are also shown .",
    "transmission is shown here as @xmath166 , as is appropriate for the balanced heterodyne detection of ref.@xcite . in the case of the simulated results ,",
    "the simulated transmission signal has been filtered down to the experimental detection bandwidth of 100 khz , and both technical noise and shot noise have been added@xcite .",
    "the transmission signal thus processed can be seen to lose some of the clarity with which it reflects the full atomic dynamics , in comparison to the transmission traces of fig .",
    "in particular , the experimental detection bandwidth is much slower than the time scale for axial oscillation in the confining potential , so that observed transmission signals are averaged over the fast variation in @xmath126 caused by these axial oscillations.the observed maximum transmission should therefore be lowered relative to theoretical predictions , by an amount dependent on the amplitude of typical axial motion .",
    "thus this finite - bandwidth effect allows for an experimental estimation of the axial confinement of a typical transit .",
    "such a procedure gives an estimate of confinement within @xmath167 @xmath168 of an antinode , in good agreement with simulation results which suggest typical confinement within @xmath169 @xmath168 .",
    "it is important to note that while such tight confinement appears typical over the duration of a trajectory , atoms commonly undergo rapid diffusive heating near the end of their confinement lifetime , which leads to their escape in a majority of cases .",
    "from the entire set of experimental and simulated trajectories like those of fig .",
    "8 , it is possible to investigate some quantitative aspects of the trapping dynamics .",
    "first we focus on the trap lifetimes produced by the triggered - trapping scheme",
    ". figures 9(a ) and 9(b ) show histograms of experimental transit times for untrapped atoms and for atoms trapped by means of the triggered - trapping strategy .",
    "transit durations are determined from the experimental data by recording the time interval during which the transmission signal is clearly distinguishable from the empty - cavity transmission level , in the presence of experimental noise .",
    "since the signal - to - noise ratio for observing transits depends on the specific probe parameters , one must be careful to compare untriggered and triggered transits observed with the same detunings and intracavity field strengths .",
    "the sole difference must be that in the untriggered case , the empty cavity field is set at a constant strength so that the atom falls through the effective potential , whereas in the triggered case the field begins at a lower level and is only turned up once the atom enters the cavity , thus confining the atom .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "8(a ) shows sample untriggered ( dashed ) and triggered ( solid ) transit signals which correspond to one another in this way .    in fig .",
    "9 the difference in transit lifetimes between triggered ( b ) and untriggered ( a ) cases is immediately striking . for their initial fall velocity of @xmath152 cm / s ,",
    "atoms have a free - fall time of @xmath170 @xmath69s across the cavity waist @xmath171 @xmath69 m ) .",
    "as discussed above , the duration of observed transits is limited by the signal - to - noise ratio , which provides a slightly more restrictive cut on transit durations , so the untriggered data set shows a mean duration of @xmath172 @xmath69s .",
    "in contrast , when the triggered - trapping strategy is employed , the mean trapping lifetime is @xmath173 @xmath69s .",
    "the dispersion about the mean likewise changes drastically from @xmath174 @xmath69s in the untriggered case to @xmath175 @xmath69s in the triggered case .",
    "these results represent a clear signature of the trapping of single atoms with single photons via this method . in this",
    "setting , atoms have been observed to remain trapped in the cavity field for as long as @xmath176 ms .",
    "the corresponding theoretical histograms are shown in figs .",
    "9(c ) and 9(d ) for the untriggered and triggered cases .",
    "the start of the transit is taken to be the time at which an atom could be distinguished in the cavity given the signal to noise , and the final time is taken to be the last point at which the transmission dropped to within the noise of the transmission with no atom .",
    "this definition accounts for the fact that as atoms move out in the radial direction the transmission often drops to around the free space value , but returns again to some large value over the time scales of the atomic motion .",
    "these levels were chosen to duplicate as closely as possible the protocol for deciding transit times for the experimental data .",
    "the simulated transit set shows a mean trapping time of @xmath177 @xmath69s in the untriggered case and @xmath178 @xmath69s in the triggered case and dispersions of @xmath179 and @xmath175 @xmath69s , respectively .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the experimental results when statistical errors and uncertainties in the initial mot parameters are taken into account .",
    "the agreement between experimental and simulated trap lifetimes , in both mean and distribution , gives an indication of the validity of the theoretically calculated trapping potential and diffusive forces on the atom .",
    "the 3.5-fold increase in observed lifetimes due to trapping is made possible by the cavity qed  interaction , which allows creation of a deep trapping potential without correspondingly large diffusion as in the free - space case .",
    "we now turn to a more detailed investigation of the dynamics of motion experienced by a trapped atom . as we have seen , the transmission signal for a single trapped atom exhibits large variations over time which may be tentatively identified with atomic motion in the radial ( gaussian ) dimensions of the cavity field .",
    "thus , for example , the highest transmission occurs when the atom passes closest to the cavity axis , @xmath180 . to determine the validity of such an identification",
    ", we examine the periods of observed oscillation in the transmission signal .",
    "the calculated effective potential is approximately gaussian in the radial dimension , so a one - dimensional conservative - motion model predicts periods as a function of oscillation amplitude in this anharmonic effective potential well .",
    "referring to the sample transits of fig .",
    "8 , one does indeed note a trend toward large modulations with long periods and smaller modulations with shorter periods . to quantify this observation , we plot period @xmath181 versus the amplitude @xmath182 for individual oscillations , where @xmath183/(h_{1}+h_{2})$ ] , with @xmath184 as indicated in fig .  8 .",
    "figure 10(a ) shows the experimental data plotted along with the calculated curve for one - dimensional motion in the effective potential @xmath135(see fig .",
    "3 ) , for the same parameters as fig .  8 .",
    "( this is a different data set from that presented in fig .",
    "4 . of ref @xcite . )",
    "note that since an atom approaches the cavity axis @xmath180 twice over the course of one orbital period , the predicted period for oscillations in the transmission signal is half the period of the underlying atomic motion .",
    "experimental data clearly map out this calculated curve for radial atomic motion , demonstrating that oscillations in the observed cavity transmission do indeed reflect radial position of an atom as it varies over time within the trap .",
    "the agreement also indicates the quantitative correctness of the theoretical model for the radial potential depth and spatial profile .",
    "note that the comparison is absolute with no adjustable parameters .",
    "the same analysis may be performed for transmission oscillations in the set of simulated transits , yielding the plot of fig .",
    "this plot again shows agreement with the calculated curve , with some spread away from the line .  for simulated transits , it is possible to turn to the underlying atomic position record to determine an angular momentum for the atom during a given oscillation .",
    "thus the oscillation data of fig .",
    "10(b ) are plotted by atomic angular momentum , where lower angular momentum data points are shown with circles .",
    "_  _ a separation by angular momentum is clearly evident , with lower angular momentum points most closely following the calculated one - dimensional ( and thus zero angular momentum ) curve .",
    "this separation , while it may seem expected , is in fact a non - trivial indication that angular momentum is a valid quantity for the atomic motion over the course of an oscillation period .",
    "since the atomic motion is not in fact conservative , but is also influenced by random ( diffusive ) forces , a separation by angular momentum can only be expected to occur if the effect of diffusive forces is sufficiently small over the time scale of an orbit in the conservative potential .",
    "the plots of fig .  3",
    "provide an initial indication that this is indeed the case for these parameters , and this idea is borne out by the current investigation . confidence in the relatively small effect of diffusion over a single orbital period is crucial in the reconstruction of two - dimensional atomic trajectories as in ref.@xcite .",

    "hence we expect that the correspondence between the simulations and experiment should be at least of the quality as in the preceding section .",
    "our starting point is the generation of a large set of simulated trajectories for the parameters reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , @xmath185 mhz with detuning parameters @xmath186 mhz and @xmath187 mhz . the initial pretriggering level of the driving laser gives a 0.15-photon mean intensity in the empty cavity ; when this level rises to 0.85 photons , indicating the presence of an atom , we trigger an increase in the driving strength to a trapping level of 0.9-photon empty - cavity intensity .  these criteria are intended to follow the parameters indicated in figs .",
    "2 and 3 of ref.@xcite .",
    "note that for the cavity geometry of this experiment , the time for an atom to transit freely through the cavity mode in the absence of any light forces is @xmath188 @xmath139s , where as before we take twice the cavity waist @xmath189 as a measure of the transverse dimension of the cavity .      from the set of such simulated trajectories ( @xmath190 in this particular case )",
    ", we can construct histograms for the number of events as a function of total transit signal duration .",
    "following the experimental protocol of ref.@xcite , which employed photon counting , we base this analysis upon the intracavity photon number @xmath191 rather than@xmath192 as in ref.@xcite , although this distinction is not critical to any of the following considerations .",
    "the resulting histograms for the experiment of ref.@xcite are displayed in fig .",
    "11 for the cases of untriggered and triggered trajectories . as in the discussion of fig .  9 ,",
    "the external drive strengths are set to be equal for this comparison to provide equal detectability for an atom passing through the cavity mode .",
    "detection with lower external drive strength gives a lower signal - to - noise ratio for atom detection , which results in detected transit durations much shorter than the actual passage time through the cavity ( which is of order @xmath193 ) , as for example in fig .",
    "2(a ) of ref.@xcite .    in support of the validity of our simulations for the experiment of pinkse et al .",
    "( including the initial atomic velocity and position distribution and the triggering conditions ) , note that the mean of @xmath194 @xmath139s for the histogram in the triggered case of fig .",
    "11(b ) corresponds quite well with that quoted in ref.@xcite , namely , @xmath195 @xmath139s .",
    "further , the histograms in fig .",
    "11 exhibit an extension of the mean transit duration from @xmath196 @xmath139s for the case of no triggering in ( a ) to @xmath194 @xmath139s with triggering in ( b ) , in support of the claim of trapping in ref.@xcite .",
    "the dispersion of events around the mean is quite large in both cases , @xmath197 @xmath69 s in the untriggered set and @xmath198 @xmath69s in the triggered set .",
    "the increase in the mean is largely associated with an increase in the number of events in the range 200 - 300 @xmath69s , as well as in the number of rare events much longer than the mean duration .",
    "once again we note that the dissipative nature of the dynamics plays a crucial role in the observed motion for the experiment of pinkse _",
    "et al_. a histogram of transit durations calculated with the sign of the friction coefficient reversed has a lower mean than that of transits with no triggering .",
    "however , it is certainly worth noting that the observed `` average trapping time '' @xmath199 @xmath139s quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as the corresponding mean time from our simulations , are smaller than the time @xmath200",
    "@xmath139s for an atom to transit freely through the cavity mode .",
    "additionally , even in the case of no triggering , there is already a significant number of events with similar long duration to those in ( b ) with triggering .",
    "such events arise from the relatively large contribution of diffusion - driven fluctuations whereby an atom randomly loses a large fraction of its initial kinetic energy as it enters the cavity .",
    "that such fluctuations play a critical role should already be clear from the plots of the confining potentials and diffusion coefficients in fig .",
    "4 .      trapping dynamics can also be explored if atomic oscillation in the trapping potential can be directly observed .",
    "certainly the observations presented in fig .",
    "10 make this case for the experiment of ref.@xcite , with the observed oscillation frequencies found to be in good quantitative agreement with those computed directly from the anharmonic potential without adjustable parameters and with the results of the numerical simulations .    towards the goal of constructing a similar plot for the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , consider a long - duration transit event such as that in fig .",
    "recall that the output flux from the cavity is given by the cavity decay rate @xmath201 into the relevant detection channel times the intracavity photon number , or @xmath202 , with then the detected count rate found from the overall propagation and detection efficiency as @xmath203 .",
    "of course , in any actual experiment the full information displayed for the intracavity photon number @xmath204 is not available because of finite detection efficiencies @xmath205 and the requirement to average over many cavity lifetimes in order to achieve an acceptable signal - to - noise ratio ( roughly for a time such that @xmath206 .    rather than attempt a detailed analysis of such effects for the experiment of ref.@xcite , here",
    "we wish to illustrate several generic effects that hinder definitive observation of radial oscillations in this regime .",
    "we therefore take _ the full ideal signal _ @xmath207 _  with no degradation due to cavity escape efficiency or subsequent system losses _ ( which we estimate to be @xmath208 and @xmath209 for an overall efficiency of 0.11 ) . as shown in fig .  12 , to this ideal signal we apply a low - pass filter with cutoff @xmath210 khz intended to optimize the visibility of any radial oscillations for frequencies @xmath211 khz , where @xmath212 khz is the orbital frequency for small - amplitude oscillation near the bottom of the radial potential .",
    "as before , recall that a periodic variation in the radial coordinate at frequency @xmath97 results in a variation in @xmath204 at @xmath213",
    ". precisely such a filtering protocol was implemented for the analysis in fig .",
    "10 , there with @xmath214 khz in correspondence to the larger radial oscillation frequencies ( @xmath215 khz for ref.@xcite ) @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the frequent and large bursts of axial heating evident for the simulated trajectories of fig .  7 result in large variations in the intracavity photon number on time scales set by twice the axial oscillation frequency @xmath216 khz .",
    "while these axial oscillations can not be directly resolved in the detected counting signal @xmath217 , their envelope nonetheless leads to variations in @xmath207 and hence @xmath217 on time scales comparable to that associated with radial motion ( i.e. , @xmath218 ) , as is apparent in fig .",
    "12 . consequently , the low - pass filtering [ or , equivalently , the time averaging over segments in @xmath217 ] that is required experimentally to obtain an acceptable signal - to - noise ratio gives rise to observed variations in @xmath207 that can arise from either axial or radial atomic motion . in the particular transit shown in fig .",
    "12 , two apparent variations on time scales @xmath220 @xmath69s are introduced by a filtering of the axial motion , whereas the longer modulation ( @xmath221s duration ) does reflect the radial position of the atom .",
    "this is something of a generic feature of the several hundred simulated transits examined ; shorter - time - scale modulations ( @xmath68 @xmath69s ) can reflect either a genuine radial excursion or a filtering of axial motion , whereas very long period variations ( 500600 @xmath69s ) are indicative of radial atomic motions .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that the bursts of axial motion tend to have time scales limited to a few @xmath222 @xmath69s .    to illustrate these points further",
    ", we have constructed a plot of period versus normalized amplitude of transmission oscillations from our simulations of the experiment of pinkse et al.@xcite , with the result given in fig .",
    "we emphasize that the protocol followed is precisely as for the analysis that led to fig .",
    "10(b ) for the experiment of hood et al.@xcite ( see also fig .",
    "4 of ref.@xcite ) , with the exception of the aforementioned reduction in the low - pass cutoff frequency . in marked contrast to that case",
    ", here there is a poor correspondence between the distribution of orbital periods from the ensemble of simulated trajectories and the prediction from the potential obtained from eq.([fop ] ) . referring to the discussion of fig .",
    "12 above , we note that about 2/3  of the points in the 100300 @xmath69s range result from averaging over axial motion , whereas for longer - period ( p>300 @xmath69s ) modulations , 80%  ofthe observed points reflect changes in the radial motion , but with associated transmission amplitude typically modified by the presence of axial motion .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "13 [ which are for the ideal case of @xmath207 without signal degradation due to finite escape and detection efficiency ] suggest that only in restricted cases can temporal variations in @xmath217 be attributed to radial motion , and not instead of ( or in addition to ) the envelopes of axial heating processes .",
    "indeed , such effects are well known in the literature , having been previously discussed for the case of individual atoms falling through the cavity mode ( albeit without triggering or trapping ) @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached , namely , that axial heating processes contaminate the frequency band associated with radial motion , thereby precluding inferences about radial motion . for the data presented by pinkse et al .",
    "@xcite , the long ( @xmath223 @xmath69s )  time scale of the modulations suggests an assignment of these signals to radial motion ; however , a more detailed characterization of the atom dynamics over a larger ensemble of transits should yield this more definitively .",
    "it is also worth noting that the quoted average trapping time _  _",
    "@xmath224 @xmath139s in ref.@xcite is itself less than @xmath225 @xmath139s , which is _ shortest time _ for a full radial orbit .",
    "hence any conclusion about motion in the radial plane must necessarily be based upon rare events in the tail of the histograms of fig .",
    "the rare occurrence of these long events is reflected in the small number of data points in fig .",
    "13 , which was constructed from the same number of simulated transits as fig .",
    "10(b ) .",
    "we next turn to analyze motion along the axial direction , and to the statement of pinkse et al.@xcite that fig .",
    "@xcite `` is direct evidence for the atom moving along the cavity axis , '' as opposed to instances of localization around an antinode for which `` hardly any periodic structure is visible . '' in their analysis , pinkse et al .",
    "employed a function @xmath226 , whose intention is to pick out two - time correlations in intensity , with an enhanced signal - to - noise ratio of intensity fluctuations by measuring coincidences of photon pairs .",
    "here we attempt to investigate manifestations of the axial motion independent of the details of any specific such function by analyzing @xmath207 directly by way of a windowed fast - fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "more specifically , for each trajectory from a large ensemble from our simulations , we apply a fft to the record @xmath207 with a hanning window centered at time @xmath227 and of total width @xmath155 @xmath139s , with the window then offset sequentially to @xmath228 @xmath139s to cover the whole range of a given atomic trajectory .",
    "the window width @xmath155 @xmath139s is chosen to be in close correspondence to the record length of @xmath154 @xmath139s employed by pinkse et al .",

    "4(b ) of pinkse et al .",
    ", for which their simulation leads to @xmath239550 khz for variations in the function @xmath240 .",
    "however , our analysis , as in the comparison of @xmath241 above , indicates that neither the observation of a peak in @xmath242 around @xmath243 nor of oscillatory structure in @xmath226 around @xmath244 is sufficient to justify direct evidence for the atom moving along the cavity axis .",
    "rather , peaks in @xmath245 are ubiquitous around frequencies @xmath246500600 , and appear whether the atom s motion is localized ( but heated ) within a given axial well or whether the atom is in flight across several wells .",
    "this feature follows from an analysis of the full record of @xmath207 without the deleterious effects of finite escape and detection efficiency , or of finite detection bandwidth .",
    "such a result suggests that the measurements of fig .",
    "4 in ref@xcite are not in and of themselves sufficient to establish unambiguous observation of atomic motion across several wells of the cavity field standing wave .",
    "our analysis does suggest that it may still be possible to distinguish between axial motion confined within a well and flight along the cavity axis through a more careful quantitative analysis of the respective spectral distributions @xmath237 .",
    "with reference to figs .  14 and 15 , note that a principal distinction between these cases is that in the case of flight there is a large _ decrease _ of spectral content in the lowest frequency components around @xmath247 .",
    "this decrease reflects the fact that axial skipping causes full - range variation in @xmath126 , and thereby pulls down the time - averaged value of transmission @xmath207 .",
    "in addition , we note an _ increase _ in @xmath248 as compared to @xmath249 for fourier components in a broad range around @xmath250 and up to @xmath251 the increase appears to reflect atomic motion that , during skipping , explores the full nonlinear ( anharmonic ) range of the axial potential .",
    "these characteristics of the overall spectral distributions seem to discriminate more reliably between flight and localized heating than does a single - frequency peak criterion ; they may still offer an avenue for observing atomic skips across the standing wave .",
    "a principal objective of this paper has been to investigate the extent to which light - induced forces in cavity qed  are distinct from their free - space counterparts .",
    "our perspective has been to seek qualitatively new manifestations of optical forces at the single - photon level within the setting of cavity qed .",
    "note that the importance of a quantum character for the relevant fields or phenomena is not ensured by the statement that the mean photon number @xmath252 , since this is trivially the case in an equivalent free - space volume for a field of the same intensity as that inside the cavity .    as a starting point",
    ", we have presented comparisons between the effective potential @xmath253 in cavity qed and the corresponding free - space potential , as well as of the diffusion coefficients in both contexts ( figs.3 and 4 ) . perhaps surprisingly ,",

    "note that the comparison of fig .",
    "4 includes `` the back action of the atom on the cavity field''@xcite , and yet there are nonetheless no substantive differences between the cavity qed  and free - space cases for the experiment of pinkse et al .",
    "hence , although the cavity qed interactions do bring a substantial advantage for atomic detection within the cavity volume , we conclude that the claim of trapping an atom with single photons in ref.@xcite involves no new characteristics unique to the cavity qed environment , with the conservative forces and diffusion largely described by the well - known free - space theory ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "friction which enhances trapping in this regime can be ascribed to cavity - mediated cooling effects@xcite , which are in themselves not uniquely features of the quantized - field treatment . however",

    "<S> the atomic motion is strongly diffusive , leading to an average localization time comparable to the time for an atom to transit freely through the cavity , and to a reduction in the ability to infer aspects of the atomic motion from the intracavity photon number .    2 </S>"
