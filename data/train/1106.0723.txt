    "clearly , a jet model is required that satisfies the condition of a soft state jet quenching factor of almost three orders of magnitude .",
    "it has been argued that the geometrically thin disks in soft state bhxbs may have much weaker vertical fields than hard state disks , and a jet quenching factor of @xmath55200 was estimated by @xcite ( 2001 ; this value has a dependence on the disk viscosity parameter and the bh spin ) .",

    "radio emission in soft state nss , when detections are made , are generally fainter than expected from their radio  x - ray luminosity correlations as measured in hard states , and are sometimes consistent with being compact , steady jets like those of hard state bhxbs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "radio emission has been detected from agn in a state analogous to the soft state of bhxbs .",
    "these are agn with evidence for thin disks ( mostly seyferts ) , and are identified by their power spectra or sometimes their spectral energy distributions .",
    "some of the least luminous seyfert radio cores @xcite have radio luminosities @xmath56100 times fainter than the fundamental plane relation of @xcite .",
    "this suggests jet production does not turn off entirely for soft state agn , and in fact jet quenching factors in different agn may cover a range @xmath561000 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the two with deep upper limits so far , 4u  1957 + 11  and h1743322 @xcite , imply soft state bhxbs may be more radio faint , on average , than soft state agn , which hints toward a fundamental difference in the jet launching process in bhs of different masses surrounded by geometrically thin disks .",

    "<S> we present ultradeep radio observations with the expanded very large array of 4u  1957 + 11 , a galactic black hole candidate x - ray binary known to exist in a persistent soft x - ray state . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a stringent upper limit of 11.4 @xmath0jy beam@xmath1 ( 3@xmath2 ) at 57 ghz , which provides the most rigorous upper limit to date on the presence of jets in a soft state black hole x - ray binary . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray , uv and optical fluxes obtained within a few weeks of the radio data can be explained by thermal emission from the disk . at this x - ray luminosity , a hard state black hole x - ray binary that follows the established empirical radio  </S>",
    "<S> x - ray correlation would be at least 330810 times brighter at radio frequencies , depending on the distance to 4u  1957 + 11 . </S>",
    "<S> this jet quenching of @xmath3 orders of magnitude is greater than some models predict , and implies the jets are prevented from being launched altogether in the soft state . </S>",
    "<S> 4u  1957 + 11  is also more than one order of magnitude fainter than the faintest of the ` radio - quiet ' population of hard state black holes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that on average , soft state stellar - mass bhs probably have fainter jets than most active galactic nuclei in a state equivalent to the soft state . </S>",
    "<S> these results have implications for the conditions required for powerful , relativistic jets to form , and provide a new empirical constraint for time- and accretion mode - dependent jet models , furthering our understanding of jet production and accretion onto bhs . </S>"
