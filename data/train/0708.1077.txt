    ", we need to modify the geometry at short length scale .",
    "technically , we need to introduce an effective ` cut - off ' in the theory .",
    "superstring theory naturally gives such a cut - off , since the ultra - violet divergence is removed by the cut - off at string scale @xmath2 .",
    "while string theory is well - defined only in ten dimensions , the structure of space - time , which includes the number of effectively emergent space - time dimensions , should be decided by itself .",
    "type iib matrix model is proposed as a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory @xcite .",

    "light - cone superstring field theory of type iib superstring is reproduced from a continuum limit of loop equations for wilson loops in the large @xmath3 limit @xcite .",
    "since this model is in some sense a lorentz covariantly regularized theory , not only space , but also even time may naturally emerge in this model .    in string theory , the effect of cut - off is seen through the t - duality transformation @xcite . in a compactified space with the radius @xmath4 , a string",

    "is completely determined by the supersymmetry transformation . in iib matrix model , the coupling to supergravity multiplet",

    "each sym with different dimensionality shows an interesting behavior and they are related with each other in a large variety of way .",
    "in particular , two dimensional @xmath0 @xmath7 sym is proposed as a type iia multi - string theory @xcite .",
