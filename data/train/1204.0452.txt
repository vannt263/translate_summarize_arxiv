    "double absorption features have so far been observed in integrated radio profiles of b1929@xmath110 ( rankin & rathnasree 1997 ) , j0437@xmath24715 ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) and b0950@xmath108 ( mclaughlin & rankin 2004 ) .",
    "they are the peculiar ` w'-shaped features observed in highly polarised emission .",
    "the minima of the ` w ' approach each other with increasing frequency @xmath3 .",
    "they have a large depth of @xmath4% ( perry & lyne 1985 ; rankin & rathnasree 1997 ) .",
    "initial attempts tried to explain the features in terms of a double eclipse , with the doubleness generated by special relativistic effects ( wright 2004 ; dyks , frackowiak , sowikowska , et al .",
    "dyks , rudak & rankin ( 2007 , hereafter drr07 ) proposed that the feature represents the shape of a microscopic beam of emitted coherent radiation .",
    "it has been suggested that this beam is also observable in pulsar profiles as a double emission feature , hereafter called a bifurcated emission component ( bec ) .",
    "examples of such components can be found in the pulse profiles of j0437@xmath24715 and j1012@xmath15307 ( dyks , rudak & demorest 2010 , hereafter drd10 ) .",
    "however , the beam that had been proposed initially by drr07  the hollow cone of emission caused by parallel acceleration  could not reproduce the observed large depth of double notches ( @xmath4% ) .",
    "drd10 have shown that the drop of flux in the minima of double notches by several tens percent imposes constraints on the general structure of the emission beam .",
    "the flux drop in the ` w ' must be caused by either a small non - emitting region ( wherein the coherent amplification fails ) , or by some obscuring / intervening / eclipsing object .",
    "for the hollow cone beam , the decrease of flux expected in such a model is maximally a few percent ( see figs .",
    "2c , and 4 in drr07 ) .",
    "this is because within the hollow - cone beam a considerable amount of radiation is emitted along many non - parallel directions .",
    "a single line of sight is then capable of receiving considerable contributions from sideway emissions .",
    "for this reason a laterally extended , two- ( or three- ) dimensional emission region contains many places that backlit the notches and make them shallow .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that this  depth problem \" can not be naturally overcome through manipulations with geometry of the non - emitting ( or absorbing ) region ( see fig . 5 in drr07 for sample results ) .",
    "in drd10 it has been recognized that the depth approaching @xmath5% results from the fact that the emission is intrinsically two - directional , or , that the beam is double - lobed .",
    "in such a case , at any pulse longitude the observer simultaneously detects radiation from two separate places located somewhere within the extended emission region . at the phase of minimum in the notches , only one of the two places is eclipsed ( or is non - emitting ) ,",
    "hence the 50% upper limit for the depth of notches .",
    "when the double - lobed beam is carried along with the electron , a split - fan beam is created , as shown in fig .",
    "[ stream ] . in this paper",
    "we show that when the line of sight cuts through the stream at an oblique angle , a specific change of the bec s shape is expected across the frequency spectrum ( section 2 ) .",
    "the resulting asymmetry of the bec allows for a piece - wise fitting of double notches with a physical beam - shape model ( section 3 ) .    one important difference between the stream - cut origin of components and the conal view of profile formation is the following : the _ altitude _ of detectable emission corresponds to that part of the stream , which is nearly tangential to the line of sight , whereas in the conal model",
    ", the altitude is fixed by a preselected value of @xmath3 ( the tangency condition determines the _ azimuth _ of detectable region , but not the altitude ) .",
    "in the case of the stream - cut scenario , when the line of sight is not in the plane of the radio - emitting stream , no ( or little ) radiation is detectable , irrespective of @xmath3 .",
    "when the sightline crosses the stream plane , only a localized piece of the stream is detectable , namely , the part that happens to be ( nearly ) tangent to the line of sight .",
    "thus , the ` observable ' altitude is frequency - independent , because the condition for tangency does not depend on the frequency of observation .",
    "consequently , if the components observed in pulse profiles arise from stream cutting ( whether they appear double , or single because of convolution effects ) , they will not exhibit the radius - to - frequency mapping ( rfm ) .",
    "that is , the components will remain at fixed , frequency - independent locations in pulse profiles observed at different @xmath3 .",
    "such a stream - cut origin of components allows us then to explain the lack of rfm in millisecond pulsars ( msps ; kramer et al .",
    "stream - cut viewing geometry is more likely in msps , because the polar cap of msps is much larger than for normal pulsars .",
    "therefore , any transverse motion of limited magnitude , like the @xmath6 drift , is less likely to create the hollow - cone emission pattern",
    ". moreover , magnetic field lines in the msps flare strongly away from the dipole axis , which facilitates cutting of sightline through streams .",
    "the split - fan emission of a stream , when projected on the sky , creates an elongated double track , such as the slanted pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ show3b ] . there",
    ", the sky - projected emission is presented at three frequencies : @xmath7 ( two left contours : l1 , and t1 ) , @xmath8 ( grey central contours : l2 , t2 ) , and @xmath9 ( two right - hand side contours : l3 , t3 ) . for clarity of the figure , the contours mark only the brightest ( topmost ) parts of the emission pattern .",
    "there is actually considerable ( and detectable ) level of emission extending all the way across the figure at each frequency .",
    "passage of sightline through the pattern , eg .  along the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ show3b ] , results in essentially double shape of observed component , regardless of the frequency of observation ( see the triple inset ) . assuming some residual rfm , for decreasing @xmath3 the double track has a maximum at increasing distances from the polar cap , ie .",
    "the location of the peak flux moves from right to left in fig .",
    "[ show3b ] . for appropriate traverse of sightline , there exists a frequency ( denoted @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ show3b ] , and hereafter called the frequency of symmetry , @xmath0 ) , at which both maxima in the bec have the same peak flux",
    ". note that for non - orthogonal cuts ( @xmath10 ) through the split pattern , the line of sight does not cross through the maxima of the @xmath0-pattern ( marked ` l2 ' and ` t2 ' in the figure ) . even at this frequency of symmetry",
    "the sightline misses the leading maximum l2 , moving on the ` far side ' of it .",
    "that is , the sightline passes through the stream at a larger radial distance @xmath11 than that of the peak emission : @xmath12 .",
    "the trailing maximum of the @xmath8-pattern is passed - by at @xmath13 , ie .",
    "below the radial distance of peak flux at this frequency .",
    "thus , _ even when peaks of an observed bec have perfectly the same - height , they nevertheless correspond to different emission altitudes _",
    "( for @xmath14 ) .",
    "for this reason , despite having equally high peaks at @xmath0 , the observed bec will not be _ ideally _ symmetric : the peaks can have somewhat different widths due to a difference in curvature radii ( see below ) .    at a lower frequency @xmath15 the bec will have the leading peak brighter than the trailing one , because our line of sight passes closer to the leading maximum in the @xmath7 pattern ( l1 ) . using the markings of fig .",
    "[ show3b ] , at frequency @xmath15 we have @xmath16 .",
    "that is , the leading peak is expected to dominate at @xmath17 if the bec is observed as a precursor ; for a ` postcursor ' position of the bec , the opposite is expected : a brighter trailing peak at @xmath17 .",
    "conversely , the trailing peak of a bec becomes brighter at @xmath18 , because @xmath19 , see fig .",
    "[ show3b ] .",
    "thus , when the bec is inspected at increasing frequencies , _ the dominating ( brighter ) peak switches from the leading to trailing position at @xmath0 _ ( see the inset of fig .  [ show3b ] ) .",
    "observations of kramer et al .",
    "1999 ( fig .  5 therein )",
    "provide evidence of such behaviour in j1012@xmath15307 .",
    "_ for the precursor location of the bec , it is the leading peak which is expected to be brighter at low @xmath3 _ , again in consistency with the profile of j1012@xmath15307 .      at the  frequency of symmetry \"",
    "the maxima of bec have precisely equal height , but the symmetry is approximate , because their widths are slightly different .",
    "the reason for this is that the width - scale of the bec also depends on the curvature of trajectory of electrons flowing in the stream ( in addition to the dependence on @xmath20 ) .",
    "low in the dipolar field , the curvature radius @xmath21 increases with altitude , as a result of which the emitted beam becomes narrower .",
    "the leading half of the bec originates from larger altitudes ( see fig .  [ show3b ] ) and should therefore be narrower than the trailing part , for which the altitude and @xmath21 are smaller .",
    "assuming the oblique cut and the normal rfm , the bifurcated _ precursors _ are then expected to have the leading wing narrower than the trailing one .",
    "weak traces of such asymmetry can be discerned in the bec of j1012@xmath15307 ( see fig .  4 in drd10 ) .",
    "this inference has been verified with a numerical code that follows beam - resolved emission of electrons moving along narrow streams in rotating dipolar magnetosphere . in the numerical calculations illustrated in figs .",
    "3 and 4 , we assume that the b - field has the geometry of the rotating retarded vacuum dipole as given by equations a1  a3 in dyks & harding ( 2004 ) . thus , we do not take into account the modifications of @xmath22 , that are expected for plasma - filled magnetosphere ( see eg .",
    "bai & spitkovsky 2010 for the force - free case ) .",
    "the usual static - shape dipole is assumed only for the analytical calculations of section 2.2.2 and fig .",
    "5 . in the calculations that have led to figs .  3 and 4 ,",
    "the local beam of non - coherent curvature radiation is emitted , with the realistic size appropriate for a preselected frequency @xmath3 , and for local @xmath21 ( as measured in the inertial observer s frame iof ) .",
    "however , instead of using the bandwidth - integrated beam , in figs .  3 and 4 we have used the ` bolometric beam ' which is integrated over the entire frequency spectrum",
    "this is because : 1 ) the bolometric beam is given by the simple analytical formula of eq .",
    "8 in drd10 , and 2 ) the shape of the bolometric beam happens to be similar to the observed shape of the bec in j1012@xmath15307 , despite the latter is bandwidth - limited only . in this way we have avoided some deeply - nested calculation loops that would have otherwise been required to perform bandwidth - limited integration of the frequency - resolved beam , which can not be expressed in a simple analytical way .",
    "such a realistic beam shape ( ie .",
    "one which corresponds to the observed bandwidth ) is only used in section 3 to fit the double notches of b1929@xmath110 . the lorentz factor @xmath23 in the bolometric beam",
    "is set to a value that corresponds to the realistic opening angle of bandwidth - limited beam at the central frequency of @xmath24 mhz , and which also corresponds to the local iof curvature radius of electron trajectory .",
    "[ note : in the low - frequency limit , ie .",
    "when the bec s spectrum extends to much higher frequency than the observation frequency @xmath3 , the frequency - resolved beam of curvature radiation does not depend on the lorentz factor , so the observation frequency and the curvature of trajectory fully define the opening angle .",
    "] thus , whereas the shape of the beam used for calculations illustrated in figs .  3 and 4 is approximate ,",
    "its opening angle is a realistic one .",
    "the aberration and propagation time effects ( for flat space - time ) are included in these calculations .",
    "note that on the ls of polar cap , the iof radius of curvature increases with the radial distance @xmath25 at a slower rate than the standard dipolar radius of curvature @xmath26 .",
    "the latter is equal to : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fieldline footprint parameter , @xmath29 is the magnetic colatitude ( measured from the dipole axis ) , @xmath30 is the magnetic colatitude of the last open field lines at radial distance @xmath25 , and @xmath31 is the light cylinder radius .",
    "the corresponding radius of curvature of electron trajectory in the iof is : @xmath32 this equation only refers to the leading side of polar tube and holds when the viewing angle @xmath33 is equal to the dipole inclination ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "comparison of eqs .   and tells us that the increase of radius of curvature with altitude is smaller for the electron trajectory , than it is for the corresponding b - field line along which the electron moves in the corotating frame cf . for the orthogonally - rotating msp with @xmath35 s ( @xmath36 cm ) ,",
    "the dipolar radius of curvature at the leading side of polar cap is @xmath37 cm , whereas the radius of curvature of the corresponding iof trajectory is equal to @xmath38 cm . in our numerical code ,",

    "a convenient function that we had arbitrarily selected was the gauss function of the iof length of electron path ( measured along their iof trajectory ) .",
    "the emissivity had a maximum at some ` path - tracing ' distance of @xmath50 from the polar cap , and the @xmath51 width of the emissivity profile was equal to @xmath52 .",

    "[ r3 ] confirm the expectations based on fig .",
    "[ show3b ] : because of the rfm , the ratio of fluxes in the two peaks becomes inverted , but the bec stays fixed at the same pulse phase at all frequencies . the separation of maxima in the bec increases for decreasing frequencies ( @xmath57 ) , which is caused purely by intrinsic properties of the emitted microbeam ; it is not caused by the rfm . the trailing half of the simulated bec is wider than the leading one ( if both are measured at half maxima ) .",
    "this results from the fact that the leading part of the bec on average originates from a larger @xmath25 than the trailing part ( see fig .  [ show3b ] ) . in the simulation shown , the asymmetry of width amounts to @xmath58% , which is noticeably larger than observed for j1012 .",

    "far from @xmath0 the ratio @xmath65 can evolve with @xmath3 or stay constant , depending on the radial profile of emissivity .",

    "regions of _ strong _ radio emission in pulsar magnetosphere are definitely more localised than shown in fig .",
    "[ skyd ] , because the observed profiles usually have duty cycles much smaller than @xmath136 . however , most of the emission that contains double features is _ not _ localized within a narrow range of phase .",

    "narrow radio pulses become a possibility when azimuthal limitations for the extent of emission are allowed , or when the radial extent of strong emissivity is not too large , yet noticeable , say @xmath137 .    it is worth to note that even for very extended emission regions , interpulses do not have to be always detectable , because of bulk topological properties of pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "one example of this is the outer gap model , in which ` the other pole ' emission is undetectable by a single observer because it is constrained to regions above the null - charge surface ( romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ; wang et al .  2011 ) .",
    "another example is the slot gap model ( arons 1983 ; muslimov & harding 2003 ) with the large - scale acceleration possible only on favourable ( poleward ) magnetic field lines .",
    "thus , in a large fraction of existing magnetosphere models the invisibility of the other pole is an inherent property .",
    "it is therefore possible that radially - extended emission streams are present in many objects , but are not directly manifested by unavoidable second - pole emission .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ show3b ] , the altitude of detectable emission changes gradually while the sightline is obliquely traversing through the double pattern .",
    "therefore , the width and height of the sampled microbeam also gradually change with pulse phase , because they depend on the curvature radius @xmath138 and @xmath25-dependent emissivity .",
    "obviously , the same is true for double features in the absorption version , ie .  for double notches which may have @xmath25-dependent width and depth .",
    "precise fits to double features then require a full 3d modelling of the stream - cut geometry , ie .",
    "the @xmath25-dependence of the depth of the notches , and the @xmath25-dependence of @xmath21 need to be assumed in addition to @xmath67 , @xmath33 , and the specific functional form of the microbeam .",
    "this kind of calculation is feasible with the code of type that produced the result shown in fig .",
    "however , the frequency - integrated ( bolometric ) microbeam which is now used by the code , would need to be replaced by an observing - band - integrated beam . and",
    "the code would have to be embedded into a fitting routine with some iterative capability of heading towards @xmath139 minimum . instead of these numerical developments",
    ", we make a direct , but piece - wise fit to the double notches of b1929@xmath110 using the bandwidth - integrated beam .",
    "more precisely , it is assumed that the left half of the notches on average originates from some unspecified altitude with one curvature radius @xmath140 , and the other half on average originates from another altitude and @xmath141 .",
    "since the scale of the fitted beam depends only on the curvature radius @xmath21 , it is only the values of @xmath142 that are provided by the fit .",
    "any further association of @xmath142 with radial distances @xmath143 is not unique because of unknown viewing geometry ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "as will be seen below , the limited quality of the best - available data on the notches of b1929@xmath110 , makes this procedure reasonable , because fractional values of @xmath144 can be reached even with this simplified model .      the radio flux at pulse longitudes surrounding the notches of b1929@xmath110 changes linearly ( see fig .  1 in drr07 )",

    "the decreased flux at the central maximum probably results from some convolution effects , such as the non - zero width of the non - emitting / eclipsing region . to avoid the complexity of such convolution ( eg .  the selection of transverse plasma density profile ) , we instead lower down the maximum by adding a bit of the parallel mode ( @xmath157 , fig .",

    "[ bandfit]a ) , the shape of the curvature subbeam neatly reflects the steepness of the outer walls of the ` w ' , as well as the bulk width of the minima , as compared to the separation between them . with the central maximum lowered down for the price of one additional fit parameter ( @xmath154 ) , the quality of the fit reaches @xmath170 and @xmath171 for the left and right - hand side notch respectively ( fig .",

    "however , to produce strong and unsmeared double features , the gyrational motion would have to be spatially ordered within a large volume of magnetosphere .",
    "this does not immediately seem to be natural .      in view of the remarkable agreement seen in fig .",
    "[ bandfit ] , it is needed to verify if the separation @xmath44 between the minima ( or maxima ) in double features is also consistent with the properties of curvature radiation . according to the classical electrodynamics , at low frequencies ( @xmath160 ) the separation @xmath44 decreases with increasing @xmath3 according to eq .",
    ", ie .  according to the power - law @xmath203 with the index @xmath204 .",
    "the bifurcation angle in this case is @xmath205 , where @xmath23 is the lorentz factor of the emitting particles . at the high - energy end of the emitted spectrum , ie .  within the high - energy spectral decline ,",
    "the features merge faster , with the index @xmath206 ( eg .",
    "jackson 1975 ) , and the bifurcation becomes very small : @xmath207 .",
    "a simple arithmetic average then allows us to expect an ` average ' merging rate of @xmath208 around the spectral maximum .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that many models of _ coherent _ curvature emission follow the same @xmath209 as the non - coherent curvature radiation .",
    "such models include those based on bunching of charges ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) , as well as some maser mechanisms ( luo & melrose 1992 ; kaganovich & lyubarsky 2010 ) ,    the theoretical range of merging rate for the curvature radiation is compared to the available data on double features in fig .",

    "dashed verticals mark the range of @xmath211 expected if the doubleness is caused by the double - lobed microscopic beam of curvature radiation ( eq .  [ int ] ) .",
    "the notches of b0950@xmath109 ( not included in this figure ) are also consistent with @xmath212 ( see fig .",
    "9 in drr07 ) . ,",
    "scaledwidth=48.0% ]    one can see that within the statistical @xmath51 errors , the measured merging rate is consistent with the one expected for the curvature beam .",
    "inspection of @xmath44 as a function of @xmath3 may even be revealing some decrease of @xmath211 at lower frequencies ( see fig .",
    "6a in drr07 ) .",
    "we remind here that it is not the merging rate that differentiates the curvature radiation from the other emission processes , because the latter can also have @xmath213 ( eg .",
    "melrose 1978 ; drd10 ) . however ,",
    "if the origin of the observed doubleness is not related to the microscopic beam , this would possibly be manifested by merging index values from outside of the range @xmath214 $ ] .",
    "the large number of indices near @xmath215 may be considered to be not quite natural for the curvature radiation , because double features should be more easily observable at low @xmath3 , where the beam is wider , and the merging index @xmath211 is closer to @xmath216 . however , double features at high @xmath3 can be more easily affected by blurring effects , which can also bring the maxima increasingly closer together , thus increasing @xmath211 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the analysis of merging rate is broadly consistent with the curvature origin of double features .",
    "we have also made several fits to the bec of j1012@xmath15307 , in which the outer wings are much less steep than the outer wings of the double notches in b1929@xmath110 .",
    "therefore , we have used functions that are a convolution of some bell - shaped plasma - density profile ( like the gauss or lorentz functions ) with the microbeam of eq .  .",
    "this type of model has appeared to be unable to reproduce the bec : before the flux in the wide outer wings has been reached , the flux in the central minimum was already too large .",
    "we conclude that with the use of the microbeam from eq .  , the shape of the outer wings of the bec in j1012@xmath15307 can not be reproduced by convolving it with bell - shaped density functions .",
    "another convolution that is possible for the simple case of @xmath160 , and which remains to be tried out , is a spread in curvature radii @xmath21 , which can act similarly to the integration over a wide frequency range ( much wider than the bandwidth ) .",
    "yet another possibility is the case of @xmath217 , ie .  the observation frequency being close to the characteristic frequency of curvature spectrum , in which case the opening angle is @xmath218 , where @xmath23 is the electron energy in units of @xmath219 .",
    "finding the shape of bec in such a case would require us to make integration over the electron energy distribution ( in addition to the spatial convolution ) .",
    "we conclude that the stream - cut geometry is a successful model for such components in radio pulse profiles like the _ apparently _ ` conal ' components in j0437@xmath24715 , or the bec in j1012@xmath15307 .",
    "such geometry naturally explains the fixed , frequency - independent location of these features in the profiles .",
    "the components stay at a fixed phase not because of the ` lack of rfm ' , but because the emission region is narrow in azimuth ( stream - like emitting region , or spoke - like , if there are more streams ) .",
    "if the rfm is added to this picture , it does not move the components away from the profile center . instead ,",
    "in the case of non - orthogonal cut through the stream , the rfm is making the double features asymmetric at all frequencies , except from at @xmath0 .",
    "this conjecture is valid for stream - like emitters with rfm regardless of the actual origin of the doubleness , ie .  regardless of whether the bifurcation has the micro- or macroscopic origin .",
    "if we assume that the doubleness reflects the shape of the microphysical beam , then the curvature radiation in the extraordinary mode becomes a natural process , because : 1 .",
    "it is intrinsically double - lobed ( bifurcated ) , which is a necessary condition for producing _ deep _ double notches ( drd10 ) ; 2 .",
    "the extraordinary part of the curvature beam reproduces the shape of notches in b1929@xmath110 ; 3 .",
    "the rate of merging of double features with increasing frequency is consistent with the curvature origin ; 4 .",
    "the width - scale of double features in b1929@xmath110 and j0437@xmath24715 is consistent with dipolar curvature radii ; 5 .",
    "the high polarisation of double features is consistent with the single - mode nature of the double - lobed beam .",
    "this said , it is not quite clear why some of the observed double features have the width of @xmath220 at 1 ghz , despite the intrinsic beam is expected to be only @xmath68 wide .",
    "however , the quite large probability of strong geometric magnification , along with the possibility of smaller - than - dipolar @xmath21 , do not really allow us to consider this issue as a serious problem for the curvature microbeam model .",
    "as recently noted by yan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who verify fairly large sample of high - quality profiles of msps , bifurcated features are rare among msps .",
    "this is in line with the special requirements that need to be fulfilled for these features to be observable .",
    "the requirements apparently include at least the following : 1 . the spatial extent ( azimuthal width of the stream ) must not be too large to blur the feature ; 2 .",
    "the feature be best magnified by geometrical effects to be wide and easily detectable .",
    "it is not clear why we do not observe features with @xmath221 , that fulfill the condition no .  1 , but are not magnified geometrically .",
    "generally , however , the intrinsic narrowness of the curvature beam seems to be consistent with the rarity of double features in the observed profiles .",
    "this is because for even a small azimuthal extent of emission region , the doubleness should become hidden by spatial convolution effects .",
    "we conclude that the asymmetry of double features at different frequencies , the shape of notches in b1920@xmath110 , the way they merge , their high polarisation , and their fixed phase locations can all be understood in terms of sightline cuts through streams of plasma that emits curvature - radiation in the orthogonal polarisation mode .",
