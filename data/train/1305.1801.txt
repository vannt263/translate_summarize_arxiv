    "ca - rich sne \" @xcite may be the result of the explosive ejection of a shell from the surface of a he - accreting white dwarf .",
    "all these sne are also formally members of the snib / c class , but their physical origin can be very different .    still , the connection between sneib / c , massive stars and grbs is one of the most important reasons to study these stellar explosions . while extremely massive stars ( m@xmath10 ) are believed to explode via the pair instability mechanism , which leaves no remnant , stars more massive than @xmath11 should collapse to form black holes .",
    "this mechanism is thought to be responsible for the emission of long - soft grbs @xcite .",
    "although the details of the energy extraction are not yet understood , there is sufficient energy to power a relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "in fact , all well observed grb / sne are broad - lined sneic , and all have been inferred to have large ejected mass and kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "these quantities are derived from modelling the light curves and spectra of these sne , and the results consistently yield ejected masses of @xmath12 , kinetic energies of several @xmath13erg , @xmath0ni  masses of @xmath14 , which have been used to infer progenitor star masses of @xmath15 .    on the other hand ,",
    "x - ray flash / sne like sn2006aj seem to come from stars of lower mass ( @xmath16 ) , suggesting that energy injection from a magnetar is the mechanism which originated the xrf and energised the explosion @xcite .",
    "there are various cases of broad - lined sneic whose properties are intermediate between those of grb / sne and those of xrf / sne and are apparently not accompanied by a relativistic outflow ( e.g.  sn1997ef @xcite ; sn1997dq @xcite ; sn2002ap @xcite ) .",
    "this may suggest that some of the properties of these sne were not sufficient for the generation of a grb .",
    "alternatively , they may all have off - axis grbs , but this seems to be ruled out by radio observations @xcite",
    ". studies of the emission line profiles in the late , nebular phase @xcite do not suggest the off - axis option for most of these sne , although they clearly do so for some of them @xcite .",

    "* ) , and that more energetic sne are more aspherical than lower - energy ones @xcite .",
    "clearly , in order to improve our understanding of these explosions , we need to extend the observed sample , cover a broader range of sn properties .",
    "a particularly interesting domain is sneib / c with properties straddling those of grb- and non - grb / sne .",

    "@xcite suggested that the sn is intermediate in spectral properties between the grb / sn1998bw @xcite and the non - grb sn1997ef @xcite .",
    "actually , sn1998bw is the closest match , as can be seen from figs . 2 and 3 of @xcite .",

    "the striking spectral similarity to sn1998bw and the lack of an associated @xmath22- or x - ray counterpart make sn2010ah an interesting event .",

    "we compare the two available spectra of sn2010ah with the spectra of sne1998bw and 2002ap that look most similar based on an eye estimate of the available ones .",
    "the overall similarity is apparent : all three sne show extreme line blending . in particular , ca  iiir and o  i7774  are blended , which requires sufficient ejecta with @xmath24 . in the blue ,",
    "most pseudo - emission peaks ( which actually correspond to regions of low line opacity where photons can escape ) are obliterated because of line blocking by high - velocity material ( fe , cr , ti ) .",
    "this effect is more apparent in sn1998bw than in either sn2002ap or 2010ah , indicating a higher metal content at high velocity . on the other hand",
    ", sn2010ah seems to have the highest line velocity of the three sne @xcite .",
    "this is shown in particular by the blueshift of the si  ii6355  absorption in the 7 mar spectrum , which has @xmath25 km  s@xmath26 .",
    "considering that the epoch of the spectrum is at least 12 days after explosion @xcite , this velocity is exceptionally high , and similar only to grb / sne @xcite .",
    "the spectra of sn2010ah and sn2002ap used for the comparison are closer to one another in time than those of sn1998bw .",
    "based on the epochs of the spectra it can be roughly estimated that the time evolution of sn2010ah is faster than that of sn1998bw by about a factor 1.3 . in section 4",
    "we show how this is in fact confirmed by the evolution of the light curves .",
    "the ptf follow - up campaign collected a good @xmath27-band light curve of sn2010ah , but other bands were poorly sampled @xcite .",

    "imaging observations of sn 2010ah in the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath23-bands were performed under non - photometric conditions with the subaru telescope equipped with the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas , * ? ? ?",

    "the images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "photometry was performed relative to 5 stars in the field for the @xmath23 and @xmath29-band images and to 4 stars for the @xmath28-band images .",
    "we used an aperture of 1.5 times the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the point - spread function ( psf ) of each image , estimated as the mean of the fwhm measured over the references stars and sn2010ah .",
    "the magnitudes of the reference stars , originally in the sdss system , were calibrated to @xmath30 using the conversions described in @xcite .",
    "color corrections were applied to each image assuming that the measurement using the filter at the adjacent longer wavelength contains the information required to perform the correction .",

    ", width=336 ]    figure 2 shows the multiband photometry of sn2010ah from @xcite and the new subaru data , highlighted as large circles . in order to build this figure ,",
    "the photometric data originally acquired with filters different from the johnson - cousins system in the ptf campaign have been reduced to this system as follows .",
    "for the p48 data , @xmath36 was assumed .",
    "the p60 @xmath37 magnitudes were transformed to @xmath38 using colours from simultaneous observations and normalisations as in @xcite .",
    "lacking spectroscopic information for sn2010ah after maximum and based on the spectral similarity with sn1998bw ( see figure 1 ) , the @xmath39 and mould-@xmath23 magnitudes of sn2010ah have been converted to the @xmath40 system and k - corrected following @xcite and @xcite , using as templates the spectra of sn1998bw at phases comparable to those of sn2010ah , after application of a time - folding factor of 1.3 .",
    "the uvot u - band filters were transformed to @xmath41 magnitudes using the zero - points of @xcite and a @xmath42 power - law for the uv spectrum .",
    "finally , synthetic magnitudes were extracted from the gemini and keck spectra .",
    "as these were both taken with the slit positioned near the parallactic angle , we assumed that in both cases flux calibration is reasonable across the whole spectrum .",
    "when we measured the synthetic photometry we conservatively assigned an uncertainty of @xmath43mag to both points , as in @xcite .",
    "the error on the first 2 @xmath23-band points has been increased to 0.2mags because the k - correction for those points is based on extrapolation from a sn1998bw spectrum whose epoch is 3.5 days later in the time frame of sn2010ah . at early epochs",
    "the spectral shape may change significantly over this time interval .",
    "a fiducial time of explosion was selected .",
    "since the explosion date is constrained by an upper limit on 19 feb 2010 , 4 days before the first ptf detection @xcite , we assumed that the explosion occurred 2 days before first detection .    in fig .",
    "2 all magnitudes have been dereddened with @xmath44 @xcite , adopting @xmath45 and the galactic extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the rest - frame light curves of sn2010ah with the much better sampled ones of sn1998bw in the same filters , and especially in the @xmath23-band , where sn2010ah has been most intensively observed , confirms that the time evolution of sn2010ah is faster than that of sn1998bw by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "if the rest - frame monochromatic light curves of sn1998bw are divided by this factor they match those of sn2010ah reasonably well ( fig .",
    "2 ) , although bluer bands in sn2010ah seem to evolve slightly faster than redder bands with respect to sn1998bw . in the @xmath41-band , the two points available for sn2010ah are below the sn1998bw template , suggesting a more rapid decay in this band , and perhaps some modest local absorption .",
    "in order to build a successful model for sn2010ah it is necessary to construct a bolometric light curve .",
    "this is essential for the estimate of the mass of @xmath0ni  synthesised in the explosion and as an input to our spectrum - synthesis code .",
    "since ptf photometry was obtained almost exclusively in the @xmath27-band , it is difficult to construct a well sampled bolometric light curve . at the same time it would be dangerous to use @xmath27 as a proxy for bolometric because the bolometric correction from @xmath27 may be different from sn to sn .    in order to compute the bolometric light curve of sn2010ah we made use of the spectroscopic similarity between sn2010ah and sn1998bw and of the similar temporal evolution after rescaling in time by a factor @xmath35 ( figure 2 ,",
    "see also * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore adopted for sn2010ah the bolometric correction from @xmath27 obtained for sn1998bw @xcite at corresponding epochs ( stretched in time by @xmath35 ) .",
    "the resulting bolometric light curve is shown in fig .",
    "the epoch and brightness of the peak are not very well determined , but the good coverage of the decline phase allows a model to be developed .    as a verification of this method ,",
    "for the two epochs when spectra are available we integrated the flux under the spectra , added 20% to account for flux outside the optical range taking sn1998bw as an example ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) , and allowed for a conservatively large error to account for uncertain flux calibration of the spectra .",
    "also , again as a verification , a bolometric magnitude was computed directly from the monochromatic data when sufficient coverage of the spectrum was available .",
    "this includes the epochs of the subaru photometry , when quasi - simultaneous wise @xmath47-band data are also available @xcite , and an epoch near 50 days , when @xmath48 and @xmath49 photometry is available .",
    "a correction of 20% was again added for flux outside the optical bands .",
    "these points are highlighted in figures 3 and 4 .        .",
    "this is a good match to sn1998bw except the earliest epochs .",
    "empty blue dots show the light curve of sn2002ap shifted upwards by 1.1 mags .",
    "this is a reasonable match to sn2010ah.,width=336 ]      a useful first step towards establishing a model for sn2010ah is to derive basic information from the light curve and the spectra . in the spirit of @xcite this requires measuring the width of the light curve and a characteristic ejecta velocity from the spectra .",
    "these in turn can be transformed into first guesses for the ejected mass and kinetic energy . in fig .",
    "4 we compare the bolometric light curve of sne2010ah , 1998bw and 2002ap , all of which look similar spectroscopically .",
    "the light curve of sn2010ah is very similar in shape to that of sn2002ap , showing a fast rise to peak , which is reached within @xmath50 days .",
    "the light curve of sn2010ah is @xmath51% broader than that of sn2002ap , but significantly narrower ( @xmath52% ) than that of sn1998bw . the characteristic velocity ( at maximum ) of sn2010ah",
    "can be derived from fig .",
    "5 of @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain a rough estimate of the properties of sn2010ah we can apply the well - known relations between ejected mass and velocity on the one hand and kinetic energy and light curve shape on the other @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath3  is the kinetic energy of the ejecta , @xmath1  the ejected mass , @xmath54 the optical opacity , @xmath55 the characteristic width of the light curve . adopting the commonly made assumption that @xmath54 is constant in all sneib / c , simple scaling relations can be obtained :    @xmath56    the results that are obtained from these relations depend sensitively on the choice of @xmath57 .",
    "this is a characteristic ejecta velocity , and in itself it is not a very well defined quantity . measuring line velocity and using that value has a number of shortcomings : 1 ) the velocity changes ( decreases ) with time ; 2 ) the velocity at which lines form can be different ( higher ) than the momentary photosphere ; 3 ) different lines may form at different velocities because of ionization or optical depth effects .    adopting a velocity used for modelling ( as for example",
    "was done for the sne shown in fig.5 of @xcite , with the exception of sn2010ah itself ) eliminates at least some of these problems .",
    "still , a single velocity does not represent the actual velocity distribution of the ejected matter .",
    "the velocity changes rapidly with time , and light curves have different shapes .",
    "very different results can be obtained if velocities at the same sn physical age ( i.e.  days from explosion , which is also an uncertain quantity except for grb / sne or for cases where shock breakout is detected ) or at a particular _ phase _ of the light curve ( e.g.  maximum ) are used , since different sne peak at different physical times from explosion .",
    "let us show some examples of this .",
    "since the epoch of maximum of the light curve of sn2010ah is not well defined , different epochs can be chosen .",
    "additionally , only two spectra are available .",
    "we use the velocity derived from the second spectrum ( 7 march 2010 ) , 18000 km  s@xmath26 . @xcite",
    "assigned to this spectrum an epoch of 11 days , based on the first detection .",
    "corresponding velocities at this epoch can be obtained for both sn1998bw ( via interpolation ) and sn2002ap ( from direct modelling ) .",
    "all values are shown in table 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath3  changes somewhat if we start from sn1998bw or from sn2002ap , reflecting the uncertainty in lc shape and time of maximum for sn2010ah .",
    "alternatively , we can consider the non - detection limit 4 days earlier , and assign to the march 7 spectrum a fiducial epoch of 13 days , as we do in the spectroscopic analysis below .",
    "the velocities of sne1998bw and 2002ap change significantly , despite the small change in epoch , and so do the results obtained for @xmath1  and @xmath3  of sn2010ah .",
    "the value of @xmath3 , in particular , is now much higher .",
    "indicative results for sn2010ah are @xmath1@xmath58 , @xmath3@xmath59erg , with large uncertainties .",
    "similarly uncertain results would be obtained if we used the earlier spectrum as a reference for velocity .",
    "this shows that the rescaling method should be applied with caution , especially if the data coverage is not excellent .",
    "furthermore , it is imperative that sne are used that have very similar spectral properties in order to avoid carrying incorrect information ( especially about @xmath3  as derived from velocities ) from the sn used as template to the one which is being studied .",
    ".derived properties of sn2010ah ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) with different assumptions about the epoch and using different reference sne , whose @xmath1   and @xmath3  are given as are their velocities at different reference epochs . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the other important quantity that can be derived by interpolation is the mass of @xmath0ni .",
    "this can be done using as reference the peak of the light curve , or alternatively the late phase .",
    "the use of different and independent methods makes the estimate of the m(@xmath0ni ) more reliable than those of @xmath1  or @xmath3 .",
    "4 shows the two different approaches .",
    "the temporal evolution of the bolometric light curve of sn2010ah looks rather similar to that of sn2002ap .",
    "if the bolometric light curve of sn2002ap is shifted up by 1.1 mag it tracks that of sn2010ah very well , except for the first point , which suggests that sn2010ah had a broader light curve .",
    "the early rise of the light curve of sn2010ah may be due to mixing out of some @xmath0ni , possibly in an aspherical explosion like that of sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "a shift of 1.1mags corresponds to a factor 2.75 in luminosity .",
    "the mass of @xmath0ni  for sn2002ap was determined from modelling as @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this yields for sn2010ah m(@xmath0ni@xmath61 , consistent with the value derived by @xcite .",
    "if we use as reference sn1998bw , on the other hand , we can follow two different approaches .",
    "the post - maximum lc of sn2010ah can be superposed on that of sn1998bw if it is scaled up by 0.9mags .",
    "this is a factor of 2.3 in luminosity . adopting for sn1998bw a @xmath0ni  mass of @xmath62 @xcite , a @xmath0ni  mass of @xmath63",
    "is obtained for sn2010ah , consistent with the value obtained when rescaling from sn2002ap .",
    "in fact , differences in the relative times are negligible at advanced epochs .",
    "this is therefore the safest approach .",
    "alternatively , one can rescale the bolometric light curve of sn2010ah in flux and stretch it by a factor 1.3 to generate a light curve that looks like that of sn1998bw . in this case",
    "the rescaling factor is only 1.6 ( 0.5 mags ) , and the @xmath0ni  mass for sn2010ah is @xmath64 .",
    "this result is clearly inconsistent .",
    "the different time evolution of the two light curves must be taken into account : at early times the contribution of @xmath0co  can be ignored , and shifting the peak from 17 days ( sn1998bw ) to 13 days ( sn2010ah ) leads to a @xmath0ni  mass for sn2010ah smaller by a factor of 0.63 with respect to the inital estimate .",
    "hence we recover m(@xmath0ni)@xmath65 , which is reasonably consistent with the estimate based on the light curve tail .",
    "we conclude that for sn2010ah m(@xmath0ni)@xmath66 . a departure from this value",
    "can be introduced by a ) any @xmath0ni  which is mixed to high velocities and is only visible in the rising phase ; b ) some deeply hidden @xmath0ni  which at peak does not yet contribute to the luminosity and only affects the light curve at very late times .",
    "this central @xmath0ni  is known to be present in a high density inner region in probably all hypernovae @xcite .",
    "a signature of this deep @xmath0ni  may also be seen in sn2010ah after about day 40 , when the lc begins to flatten , although data unfortunately stop soon thereafter .",
    "therefore , m(@xmath0ni)@xmath67 is probably a lower limit for the mass of @xmath0ni  in sn2010ah .",
    "given the description above , only accurate spectral ( and light curve ) modelling can yield reliable information on the properties of sneib / c . for sn2010ah",
    "only two spectra are available , so a very accurate result should not be expected . however , since the two spectra are separated by several days modelling may yield significant information .",
    "we used our sn montecarlo spectrum synthesis code , which was first presented by .",
    "the code computes radiation transport in a sn ejecta starting from an assumed luminosity emitted at a lower boundary as a black body .",
    "sn ejecta are assumed to be in free expansion , so that @xmath68 .",
    "bound - free processes are ignored , but electron scattering and line absorption are considered .",
    "the latter is treated including the process of fluorescence , which is essential for the formation of type i sn spectra @xcite .",
    "radiative equilibrium is enforced in the sn envelope by conserving photon packets .",
    "level populations are computed adopting a modified nebular approximation , which successfully accounts for the deviation from lte .",
    "the code has been successfully applied to a number of different sneib / c ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) , and it has proved a very useful tool to go beyond line identification : thanks to its physical treatment of opacities it allows different density and abundance profiles to be tested , so that various sn properties can be determined quantitatively .    since our code uses a physical luminosity , flux - calibrated spectra are necessary for a meaningful comparison .",
    "the spectra are assumed to be reasonably well flux - calibrated based on the observational techniques used to obtain them .",
    "we corrected them for a milky way extinction of @xmath69 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) and measured r - band magnitudes using the pysynphot package . in order to account for calibration errors we applied a large error of 0.3mags for both measurements .",
    "the corrected observed magnitudes are @xmath70mag for the gemini spectrum and @xmath71mag for the keck spectrum .",
    "our code requires as input a density distribution .",
    "this is essential in order to define the properties of the sn .",
    "in particular , sneic with progressively broader lines are characterised by increasing values of the parameter @xmath3/@xmath1 .",
    "low - energy ,  normal \" sne like sn1994i have @xmath3/@xmath1@xmath72 @xcite , while grb / sne like sn1998bw , which show very broad lines , have @xmath3/@xmath1@xmath73 @xcite .",
    "given the spectral similarity between sn2010ah , sn1998bw and sn2002ap , we adopt the explosion model that was used for sn1998bw , rescaling it to match the parameters of sn2010ah as estimated above .",
    "we use a distance of 216mpc ( i.e.  a distance modulus @xmath74mag ) assuming @xmath75 km  s@xmath26mpc@xmath26 and standard cosmology , and a reddening @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "given the estimated mass and energy of sn2010ah , we started by rescaling the model for sn1998bw ( model co138 , @xmath1@xmath76 , @xmath3@xmath77erg , * ? ? ? * ) by a factor between 0.3 and 0.5 in mass , which obviously implies a reduction in energy of the same magnitude .",
    "since both spectra are relatively early , our models can only probe the outer part of the ejecta .",
    "therefore , while they can yield a reasonable estimate of the one - dimensional energy , which is mostly associated with the high - velocity outer ejecta , they can not probe the bulk of the mass , which is located at lower velocities and deeper layers than the early spectra can reach .",
    "a more accurate estimate of the mass in this case requires modelling the light curve .",
    "nebular spectra would be very useful for this purpose ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but none are available for sn2010ah .",
    "a fundamental element is the choice of risetime .",
    "the longer the risetime , the larger the ejected mass has to be in order to obtain a reasonable spectrum .",
    "sn2010ah was first detected on 23.5 feb 2010 .",
    "the first spectrum was obtained on 2 mar 2010 , i.e.  7 days later .",
    "a deep non - detection limit 4 days prior to discovery means that the upper limit for the age of the first spectrum is 11 days ( 10.5 rest - frame days ) .",
    "averaging these values , we assume @xmath78days as the epoch of the first spectrum . considering the redshift @xmath79 , we adopted for the 2 mar spectrum @xmath80d .",
    "our code computes a spectrum starting from the sn physical parameters @xmath81 , and @xmath57 , in order to define a consistent temperature structure in the ejecta .",
    "the photospheric velocity @xmath82 can be inferred from the spectra . @xcite measured a si  ii6355  absorption velocity @xmath83 km  s@xmath26  in the 2 march spectrum .",
    "we adopt for the model a slightly lower velocity , @xmath84 km  s@xmath26 , and obtain a reasonable solution for the spectrum .",
    "the luminosity necessary to reproduce the flux in the 2 mar spectrum is @xmath85erg s@xmath26 , i.e.  @xmath86 .",
    "given the rather small epoch , we find that the best results are obtained if model co138 is rescaled in mass by a factor 0.3 .",
    "this gives @xmath1@xmath87 ; @xmath3@xmath88erg , but we should remark once more that the mass derived from the spectral fits alone can be highly uncertain since the spectra do not cover a large range of epochs .",
    "it appears however that a much smaller mass is located at high velocities than in the case of sn1998bw , so we need to reduce the mass at @xmath89 km  s@xmath26 .",
    "we did this by steepening the density slope , using a power - law @xmath90 with index @xmath91 above 20000 km  s@xmath26 .",
    "we find @xmath92 at @xmath93 , compared to @xmath94 for sn1998bw .",
    "there is however practically no material at @xmath95 km  s@xmath26 , as was also the case for sn1998bw . on 2 mar 2010 ,",
    "only @xmath14 of material is found above @xmath82 . the equivalent model for sn1998bw had @xmath96 located above @xmath97 km  s@xmath26  on 3 may 1998 @xcite , 8 days after explosion .",
    "therefore the velocity of sn2010ah is actually slightly smaller than that of sn1998bw .",
    "the synthetic spectrum is compared to the observed one in fig .",
    "main features are fe  ii  absorption at @xmath98 , 4600 , si  ii  near 6000 , the o  i - ca  ii  blend near 7000 .",
    "the observed spectrum is reproduced adopting a composition above the photosphere dominated by oxygen ( 78% by number ) , followed by ne ( 20% ) , intermediate - mass elements ( 5% ) .",
    "ca and fe are only present at the level of @xmath99% .",
    "the next spectrum is only 5 days later , 7 mar 2010 .",
    "this corresponds to 14 days , ( 13.3 days in the rest frame ) .",
    "the velocity in this spectrum has dropped significantly ( * ? ? ?",
    "* measured 18000 km  s@xmath26  in the si  ii line ) , which is compatible with the drop observed in both grb / hne and non - grb / hne .",
    "we can thus probe deeper layers of the ejecta .",
    "the luminosity required to match the flux is @xmath100erg s@xmath26 , i.e.  @xmath101 .",
    "a velocity of @xmath102 km  s@xmath26  gives the best fit to the spectrum using the same density distribution as at the earlier epoch rescaled to the later epoch ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "the photospheric velocity drops by much more than the observed si  ii  velocity , suggesting that the observed feature is affected by other contributions .",
    "on the other hand , our synthetic si  ii  line has a somewhat lower velocity than the observed one . at this epoch",
    "the mass above the photosphere is @xmath103 .",
    "the composition is similar to that used for the previous epoch , with a little less oxygen ( 60% ) , replaced by neon ( 30% ) .",
    "the spectrum is still formed inside the oxygen layer .",
    "abundances do not indicate enrichment of intermediate - mass elements or mixing - out of fe .",
    "the synthetic o  i  line is too deep , but it is blended with ca  iiir , which actually dominates in strength near 7500 .",
    "a lower density may lead to a better o  i  line , but the si  ii  line would look worse . since we only have these two spectra , we refrain from performing a more detailed but uncertain analysis .",
    "we rather turn to the light curve in order to determine parameters such as @xmath1 , @xmath0ni  mass and distribution .",
    "it is well known that light curve models alone do not have the ability to determine uniquely all sn parameters . in particular , while the mass of @xmath0nican be reasonably well established from the light curve peak if the time of explosion is known to within a good accuracy , or from the late , exponential decline phase of the light curve if this is observed , the two parameters that determine the shape of the light curve , @xmath1  and @xmath3 , are degenerate ( eq.2 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "only the simultaneous use of light curve and spectra can break this degeneracy @xcite .",
    "having established the most likely values of @xmath1  and @xmath3  through spectral modelling , we can test whether they can reproduce the light curve @xcite .",
    "fitting the light curve yields additional information about the mass and distribution of @xmath0ni , in particular at velocities lower than the photosphere sampled by the spectra .",
    "this is particularly useful for sn2010ah , since for this sn we do not have nebular spectra , which would make it possible to obtain an accurate description of the inner ejecta ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the properties of the light curve of a sn of type i ( i.e.  h - free ) are determined by the mass of @xmath0ni , which determines the overall luminosity , and by the mass , density and composition of the ejecta .",
    "mass and energy have a direct impact on the density of the ejecta as a function of time , and hence on the diffusion time of the photons .",
    "the abundances in the ejecta are important in that they determine the opacity ( in a type i sn this is dominated by line opacity ; * ? ? ?",
    "if both early and late - time spectra are available , all these quantities can be independently determined through spectral modelling .",
    "typically only small modifications to the mass and distribution of @xmath0ni  are required to reproduce the light curve and validate the results @xcite .",
    "this is however not the case for sn2010ah , since no nebular spectra are available .",
    "here we must rely on light curve modelling alone to establish the mass and density of the inner layers .",
    "still , the properties of the outer layers are known from the early - time spectra , and so @xmath3  is reasonably well established .",
    "we use the one - dimensional , monochromatic light curve code described in @xcite and later modifications .",
    "the code is based on the montecarlo method : given a density structure of the ejecta and a @xmath0ni  distribution , the emission and deposition of @xmath22-rays and positrons produced in the radioactive decay of @xmath0ni  to @xmath0co  and hence to @xmath0fe  are computed .",
    "deposition is assumed to be instantaneous , and to be followed by the emission of optical photons .",
    "photon diffusion , which determines the light curve , is also followed with a montecarlo scheme .",
    "optical opacity is treated assuming that line opacity dominates : accordingly , it is assumed to depend on composition , as in @xcite , reflecting the different number of active spectral lines in different atomic species .",
    "light curve of sn2010ah and two models , one obtained using the rescaled explosion model used to fit the spectra ( blue ) and one where corrections have been applied for mixed - out @xmath0ni  and a dense inner core ( black ) . the bigger blue points are those obtained from direct integration of the observed magnitudes from the spectra ( near peak ) , from subaru photometry ( @xmath52 days ) , and at one late epoch ( 14 april 2010 , 49 rest - frame days ) when multiple photometry was available.,width=336 ]    initially , we use as input the density / abundance profiles derived from early - time spectral modelling .",
    "in particular , the model we used has @xmath1@xmath104 , @xmath3@xmath105erg .",
    "the result is the synthetic light curve shown in blue in fig.7 .",
    "this reproduces the maximum using a @xmath0ni  mass of @xmath106 , but the rise is delayed relative to the observations .",
    "the decline is also well reproduced , but only until day 30 or so .",
    "neither of these problems is new in the context of snic light curve modelling : the slow rise of the synthetic light curve is typically the result of insufficient mixing - out of @xmath0ni , while the slow observed late - time decline is actually common to all sneic , and a solution was proposed that involves a dense low - velocity core , possibly a signature of an aspherical explosion @xcite .",
    "we therefore modified both the inner density and the outer @xmath0ni  abundance , and obtained the light curve shown in black in fig .",
    "7 . this modified model has a power - law index @xmath107 below 20000 km  s@xmath26 .",
    "it also has a slightly larger mass : @xmath108 .",
    "the additional @xmath109 are located at @xmath110 km  s@xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath0ni  distribution is also enhanced : outer layers ( @xmath111 km  s@xmath26 ) contain a @xmath0ni  mass fraction of @xmath50% .",
    "this is much larger than the spectral modelling results , which indicate @xmath112% .",
    "the @xmath0ni  mass is now @xmath113 ( instead of @xmath106 ) , but because of the location of the additional @xmath0ni  there is no effect on the peak of the light curve , only on the rising phase .",
    "the highest @xmath0ni  abundance is at the lowest velocities , @xmath114 km  s@xmath26 , where a mass fraction of more than 50% is reached .",
    "however , most of the @xmath0ni  is located at intermediate velocities , with a mass fraction of @xmath115% at 5000 - 10000 km  s@xmath26  and @xmath112% at 10000 - 20000 km  s@xmath26 .",
    "the kinetic energy , on the other hand , is only marginally increased ( now @xmath116erg instead of @xmath117erg ) .",
    "the modified model gives a better match to the overall light curve of sn2010ah .",
    "only the last phase ( @xmath118d ) shows a discrepancy . a further increase in mass at very low velocities may be a solution , but we refrain from attempting such models because of the lack of later points to confirm the slower decline",
    "additionally , although galaxy subtraction has been applied homogeneously to all images @xcite , since the galaxy brightness in @xmath27 is comparable to that of sn2010ah at about 30 days after explosion , the presence of some residual at epochs @xmath119 days can not be excluded .",
    "this may explain the excess seen in fig .",
    "7 .    in the modified models @xmath0ni  is added mostly at high velocity ( @xmath120 km  s@xmath26 ) .",
    "this requires reaching a @xmath0ni  mass fraction of @xmath121 in the outer ejecta .",
    "although the @xmath0ni  distribution we have used yields a reasonably good match to the peak of the light curve of sn2010ah , it is inconsistent with the abundance of @xmath0ni  and decay products required for the spectra .",
    "this discrepancy is potentially interesting .",
    "it may indicate that some @xmath0ni  was ejected at high velocity but not along our line of sight , so that it caused the rapid rise of the light curve @xcite without leaving an imprint on the spectra in the form of absorption lines .",
    "although this suggestion depends mostly on the first light curve point , this interpretation is appealing in view of the properties of highly energetic sneic .",
    "we know from nebular spectroscopy that the distribution of elements is not spherically symmetric , in the sense that some @xmath0ni  and fe are found at high velocities , probably in a funnel - like distribution which may track the position of the grb jet in some cases @xcite , while oxygen and other unburned elements are ejected more in a plane , likely the equator of the progenitor .",
    "two - dimensional models suggest this @xcite .",
    "there is further evidence for asphericity in sneib / c .",
    "nebular studies suggest that even lower - energy sne can be aspherical , albeit to a lesser degree @xcite .",
    "it is also particularly interesting that in a snib linked to an x - ray flash ( sn2008d , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectral analysis suggests a high kinetic energy and the presence of a jet which was quenched by the helium shell @xcite , and later data confirmed asphericity in the oxygen distribution @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy derived for sn2010ah is larger than that of sn2008d , although smaller than in grb / sne , and the ejected mass is compatible with that of sn2008d if the he shell in the latter is not considered .",
    "an off - axis , jet - driven sn was proposed for sn2008d @xcite .",
    "more energetic sneic are all linked to grbs and aspherical ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "given the peculiarly high first point in the light curve of sn2010ah , an aspherical distribution of elements may also be speculated for sn2010ah .",
    "the lack of nebular or spectropolarimetric data prevents us from testing this hypothesis .",
    "the results of the analysis we performed can be used to estimate the properties of the progenitor of sn2010ah .",
    "this is interesting , because of the suggested relation between @xmath3 , m(@xmath0ni ) , and @xmath1 , which should be a good proxy for the mass of the progenitor star @xcite . in the case of sn2010ah",
    ", we found @xmath1@xmath122 , @xmath3@xmath123erg ( in spherical symmetry ) , m(@xmath0ni)@xmath124 .",
    "if we plot the properties of sn2010ah and those of other well studied sne ( figures 8 and 9 ) , we see a trend between @xmath1 , m(@xmath0ni ) , and @xmath3 . figure 8 shows m(@xmath0ni ) v. @xmath3 .",
    "the trend is clear , although sn2006aj deviates somewhat . in this case",
    "the birth of a magnetar was suggested @xcite , and the energy released may have led to an increased synthesis of @xmath0ni .",
    "slightly more massive progenitors probably collapsed to a black hole , thus reducing the amount of material available for nucleosynthesis . at larger masses ( and larger energies ) the efficiency of production and ejection of @xmath0niincreases again .",
    "figure 9 shows m(@xmath0ni ) v. @xmath3 . here",
    "the relation is less well defined , but a trend is still visible .",
    "sneib and iib have a massive he envelope and lie slightly higher in the plot , suggesting that the @xmath3  is not influenced by the properties of the outer layers , as is reasonable to expect .",
    "ni  and the @xmath3  as derived from spectral / light curve modelling of a number of sneib / c .",

    "colour - coding is by spectral type , and it is the same as in fig .",
    "9.,width=347 ]    we can try to go from the estimated @xmath1  to a progenitor mass . using the @xcite models , and assuming that the mass ejected by sn2010ah corresponds to the co core of a massive star minus the remnant mass , we end up with a black hole remnant , a co core of @xmath8 , and a m@xmath125 . in the more traditional plots of m(@xmath0ni ) or @xmath3  v.",
    "m@xmath126 ( figures 10 and 11 ) , sn2010ah falls nicely on the relation that is taking shape ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this relation is derived for single - star evolution , and using a single , albeit old set of stellar models .",
    "the process of stripping the outer h and he layers may require interaction with a companion in a binary system @xcite and may not be easy to parametrise . also , the uncertainty on the nature of the remnant ( a neutron star or a black hole ? ) may introduce errors in the mass estimate .",
    "still , in the case of sn2010ah , it looks as if all properties we derived ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 , m(@xmath0ni ) ) are consistently smaller than those of grb / sne , although they are large compared to other non - grb / hne .",
    "we may be testing the limits for stars to produce grbs .",
    "another recent non - grb / hn , sn2010ay @xcite may come even closer to this limit and it will be an interesting case study .",
    "a question remains concerning sn2010ah : did it produce a grb , or was it at least driven by a jet which failed to escape from the star , as was suggested for sn2008d @xcite ?",
    "no detection of a grb has been reported .",
    "off - axis grbs may be detected in the radio , but this is not the case for sn2010ah @xcite .",
    "the anomalously rapid rise of the light curve may suggest the presence of highly processed material in a direction not along our line of sight , but this can not be regarded as a strong argument in the absence of other supporting evidence .",
    "spectropolarimetry in the early phase or late - time spectroscopy would be useful in order to reveal asphericities .",
    "these may in turn point to the presence of a jet which , as in the case of sn2008d @xcite , may have aided exploding the star even though it may not have emerged from it .",
    "unfortunately , no such data are available for sn2010ah , so we can not determine the degree of asphericity or the presence of any asymmetry .",
    "a suggestion for asphericity drawn from the rapid rise of the light curve may be a point in favour of this .",
