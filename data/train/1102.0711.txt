    "liquid crystal phases consist of anisotropic molecules , either elongated or disk - like @xcite . in many theoretical @xcite and computer simulation studies @xcite it is assumed that the molecules have the @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) symmetry and that the interactions do not change if a molecule will point to the opposite direction",
