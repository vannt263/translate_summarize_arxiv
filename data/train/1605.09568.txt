    "metrological measurements are of paramount importance in fundamental physics and technology .",
    "they generally rely on the estimation of the value of a parameter  @xmath1 ( e.g. ,  the amplitude of a dc or ac electromagnetic field , a small mechanical force , _ etc _ ) controlling the evolution of a quantum system .",
    "this system , initially prepared in a ` resource ' state , evolves according to the parameter value and is finally measured , directly or indirectly through ancillae .",
    "due to the intrinsically statistical nature of the quantum measurement , the final standard deviation , @xmath2 , of the parameter estimation scales as @xmath3 , in the limit of a large number @xmath4 of experimental realizations : @xmath5 ( saturated cramr  rao bound @xcite ) . here , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fisher information provided by a single realization of the measurement protocol .    for a given resource state , @xmath7",
    "is bounded from above by the quantum fisher information , @xmath8 .",
    "it measures the maximal information on @xmath1 which can be imprinted onto the resource state and is independent upon the final measurement procedure ( quantum cramr ",
    "rao bound @xcite ) . optimizing the measurement precision amounts to choosing the resource state so that @xmath8 is large and to choosing the final system s measurement to realize @xmath9 .",
    "when the resource state is classical ( e.g. ,  a coherent state for a harmonic oscillator ) , @xmath8 defines the standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite .",
    "this limit can be overcome by using a non - classical resource state @xcite , such as a squeeezed state @xcite or a mesoscopic quantum state superposition ( mqss ) @xcite .",
    "this strategy has led to a considerable development for quantum - enabled metrology  @xcite beyond the sql . among the many remarkable achievements of this active field ,",
    "let us mention sensitive optical phase measurements @xcite , magnetometry @xcite , and gravitational wave detection @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting class of measurements is that of a weak force acting on an oscillator - like system and resulting in a small displacement of the resource state @xcite .",
    "it is relevant for the detection of small forces in the optomechanical context @xcite , of a photon scattering recoil in ion traps @xcite , and of weak fields in spin systems  @xcite .    for harmonic oscillator displacements ,",
    "the sql is simply determined by the extension of the wigner distribution in phase space of a classical coherent state , of the order of @xmath10 .  as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , beating the sql thus amounts to using a resource state whose wigner representation has structures at a scale lower than @xmath10 , i.e. ,  sub - planck structures , conspicuous in squeezed states or in mqss .    in this paper , we report the first quantum - enabled measurement of a microwave field amplitude based on a mesoscopic non - classical resource state of an entangled atom - cavity system .",
    "it uses the resonant interaction between an initially coherent field in a superconducting cavity and a single circular rydberg atom , as proposed in ref .",
    "this interaction prepares a mqss entangled state , which is used as a resource for measuring the amplitude of a microwave field injected into the cavity , and leads to a quantum fisher information much larger than that resulting from the initial coherent state .",
    "the resource state undergoes the displacement by an amplitude @xmath1 to be measured .",
    "the subsequent atom - field interaction and the final state - selective atomic detection lead to a quantum measurement approaching the quantum cramr  rao bound .",
    "the precision @xmath11 is found to beat the sql , by 2.4 db .",
    "this quantum - enabled measurement protocol could be fruitfully transposed in other contexts , particularly that of circuit qed .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section  ii describes in more details the measurement protocol .",
    "section iii analyzes the measurement in terms of fisher information and shows that it ideally saturates the quantum cramr  rao bound .",
    "section iv is devoted to the description of the experiment and section v to a discussion of its results .",
    "we finally conclude in section  vi .",
    "the aim of this experiment is to measure the amplitude @xmath1 of a small displacement produced by a classical source coupled to a cavity . along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , we use as measuring system a two - level atom ( upper state @xmath12 , lower state @xmath13 ) and a field stored in the cavity .",
    "the resource state is produced by the resonant interaction during a time @xmath14 of the atom , initially in @xmath12 , with a coherent field @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the fock state with @xmath17 photons and @xmath18 is taken as real without loss of generality .",
    "the atom undergoes in the initial coherent field a quantum rabi oscillation entangling it with the cavity . in an approximation valid for a large enough @xmath18 and for moderate interaction times",

    "the atom and the cavity are not yet maximally entangled and the population of state @xmath13 undergoes a rabi oscillation at the average frequency @xmath24 . as the two components separate further , the atom - cavity entanglement grows and the rabi oscillations accordingly collapse after the characteristic collapse time @xmath25 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the two field components are nearly orthogonal , and the atom - field system is cast in a mqss .",
    "figure  [ fig : phasespace ] schematically shows the evolution of the field in phase space starting from the initial state @xmath27 .",
    "the creation of the resource mqss corresponds to two arrows labelled @xmath28 .",
    "after time @xmath14 , we perform the displacement by a real amplitude @xmath1 , both field components being changed into @xmath29 , see arrows labelled @xmath30 .    .",
    "see text for details.,width=226 ]    the measurement of the system starts after this injection .",
    "it relies on the observation of a revival of the rabi oscillation . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the rabi signal can be revived after its initial collapse by applying a time inversion , induced by a @xmath31-phase shift between atomic states @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",

    "the two components of the field mqss merge again ( arrows @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] ) for a measurement time @xmath35 around @xmath14 . at the end of this period ,",
    "the interaction is stopped by detuning the atomic frequency out of the cavity resonance and the atomic state is measured in the @xmath36 basis",
    ".    for @xmath37 , the final probability , @xmath38 , for finding the atom in state @xmath13 has the following simple expression : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the separation , in phase space , of the field components @xmath41 before the measurement .",
    "these expressions hold when @xmath42 is notably larger than  @xmath28 ( atom - field entanglement condition ) and when @xmath43 is not too large ( implying that @xmath18 is large ) so that @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath38 signal is an oscillatory function of @xmath1 , providing direct information on the displacement amplitude .",
    "note that for large initial field amplitude @xmath18 , the oscillation period is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the oscillation phase , @xmath45 , is about 4 times the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] , and reflects the geometric phase accumulated by the mqss coherent components during their excursion in phase space .",
    "clearly , this area , and hence the sensitivity , are maximal when the phase of the initial coherent state matches that of the measured displacement .",
    "moreover , these oscillations are not limited to small values of @xmath1 , allowing one in principle to measure arbitrarily large field amplitudes with the same high precision . note that the @xmath38 oscillation period , @xmath46 , is the same as that of the oscillations observed close to the origin in phase space for the wigner function of the mqss @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , such states known as ` photonic cat ' states @xcite can also be used for sub - planck metrology .",
    "however , the corresponding methods are limited to small @xmath1 values , @xmath48 .",
    "in the general case of @xmath49 , the final probability @xmath38 reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 the contrast @xmath52 of this oscillating function of @xmath1 is set by the overlap of the coherent field components at @xmath35 , given  by @xmath53 the highest sensitivity for a given resource state ( fixed @xmath14 and large @xmath18 ) is obtained by compromising a faster oscillation frequency ( obtained for large @xmath35 values ) and the decay of @xmath52 for @xmath54 .",
    "let us now discuss the performance of this measurement in terms of fisher information .",
    "the absolute quantum limit for a given resource state is set by the quantum fisher information , @xmath8 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the qfi is linked to the variance in the resource state of the operator @xmath55 generating the unitary displacement @xmath56 : @xmath57 using the resource state of eq .  , and",
    "for the same approximation as above , we obtain @xmath58    the smallest value of @xmath8 is 4 , corresponding to a coherent resource state ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "it thus defines the sql and leads to @xmath60 .",
    "increasing the resource size @xmath42 and using a proper measurement , we go beyond the sql and enter the sub - planck region .",
    "ultimately , for @xmath61 reached at @xmath62 , the size @xmath42 is maximal ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 .",
    "this corresponds to the heisenberg limit ( hl ) in this context . since in our experiment , as will be discussed later , we are technically limited by the interaction duration , rather than by the resource energy , from now on , we focus on moderately large values of @xmath14 so that @xmath65    the actual information extracted by the measurement protocol is measured by the fisher information ( fi ) of the atomic signal . for a discrete measurement with two possible outcomes @xmath66 , this fi is given by @xmath67 using , we get @xmath68    the variation of @xmath7 with @xmath69 , except for @xmath70 , reflects the oscillations of @xmath38",

    "the quantum phase accumulated on the coherent components trajectories increases linearly with @xmath35 . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> we report a quantum measurement beyond the standard quantum limit ( sql ) for the amplitude of a small displacement acting on a cavity field . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement uses as resource an entangled mesoscopic state , prepared by the resonant interaction of a circular rydberg atom with a field stored in a superconducting cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the measurement process in terms of fisher information and prove that it is , in principle , optimal . the achieved experimental precision , @xmath0  db below the sql , is well understood in terms of experimental imperfections.this method could be transposed to other systems , particularly to circuit qed , for the precise measurements of weak forces acting on oscillators . </S>"
