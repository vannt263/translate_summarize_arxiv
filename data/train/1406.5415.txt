    "<S> , the low-@xmath0 qsl is separated from the high-@xmath0 paramagnet by the thermodynamic singularity at @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> there is no adiabatic connection between the two states , and the transition always appears to be continuous within the present calculations . </S>",
    "<S> these are in sharp contrast to the situation in conventional fluids where liquid and gas are adiabatically connected with each other beyond the critical end point in the phase boundary of the discontinuous transition . </S>",
    "<S> thus , thermodynamics of the qsls is not understood by the conventional theory for liquids .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the value of @xmath44 becomes maximum at @xmath48 : the qsl phase is most stable against thermal fluctuations in the isotropic case . </S>",

    "<S> hence , interestingly , our mc results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) show that the frustration tends to stabilize the qsl against thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this frustration effect is opposite to that on conventional magnetically ordered states where frustration suppresses the critical temperatures .     </S>",
    "<S> variables @xmath5 per ten - site plaquette , @xmath56 , and ( d ) the wilson loop @xmath57 . ]    in the vicinity of @xmath22 , the ground state is the gapless qsl . by decreasing @xmath43 , the ground state changes into the gapped qsl at the quantum critical point at @xmath58 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath44 changes smoothly around @xmath58 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> also we find no singularity in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath37 around @xmath58 within the present precision , except for @xmath44 [ e.g. , see fig .  [ fig4](a ) ] . in the low-@xmath0 limit , however , there should be some anomaly in @xmath37 , reflecting the change of low - energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that such anomaly will happen to be seen at much lower @xmath0 than @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us discuss the reason why the specific heat @xmath37 exhibits two peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we show the @xmath0 dependence of the entropy per site , @xmath60 , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) , obtained by the numerical integration of @xmath37 divided by @xmath0 . by decreasing @xmath0 , the entropy decreases from @xmath61 corresponding to the high-@xmath0 peak in @xmath37 and approaches @xmath62 . in the @xmath0 region between the two peaks in @xmath37 , </S>",
    "<S> the entropy stays at @xmath63 . as further decreasing @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the entropy rapidly deceases again corresponding to the low-@xmath0 peak in @xmath37 , and approaches zero toward @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the successive entropy release is ascribed to a separation of the energy scales for the majorana fermions and the @xmath4 variables @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , while decreasing @xmath0 , the entropy of @xmath62 associated with majorana fermions is first gradually released at @xmath66 , corresponding to their kinetic energy scale @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the remaining entropy of @xmath62 , associated with the @xmath4 variables , is released at the phase transition . this lower energy scale is set by the effective interactions between the @xmath4 variables mediated by majorana fermions , which depend on the anisotropy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm this picture by calculating @xmath56 defined as the thermal average of the density of the @xmath4 variables @xmath68 defined for each ten - site loop [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) ] , which is computed by the product of @xmath65  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4](c ) shows the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity rapidly increases at the lower-@xmath0 peak in @xmath37 as @xmath0 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the entropy of @xmath62 is released according to the coherent growth of @xmath5 at @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , it is worth noting that the phase transition at @xmath44 is not caused by the symmetry breaking in terms of the local variables @xmath5 . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the phase transition will be understood by the topological nature of excited states as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the excited states are generated by flipping @xmath5 from the ground state where all @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the flipped @xmath70 form loops because of the local constraints originating from the fundamental spin-1/2 algebra  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energy of loops and their configurational entropy compete with each other , which may lead to the phase transition at a finite @xmath0 , as is discussed by peierls for the 2d ising model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this picture was indeed confirmed in the limit of @xmath71 , through the winding number defined for @xmath5  @xcite . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> however , the winding number can not be defined , as the calculations are done under the open boundary conditions in the @xmath72 and @xmath33 directions . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we calculate the thermal average of the wilson loop along the edge of the @xmath73 plane , @xmath57 , which serves as an alternative parameter to the winding number  @xcite . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](d ) , @xmath57 behaves like an order parameter : it becomes nonzero below @xmath44  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is in sharp contrast to the 2d kitaev model , where the excitation with @xmath70 is allowed independently without local constraints , and consequently , the qsl is adiabatically connected to the high-@xmath0 paramagnet .    </S>",
    "<S> our results on the topological transition suggest a new paradigm of critical phenomena beyond the ginzburg - landau - wilson ( glw ) theory . due to the lack of local order parameter , </S>",
    "<S> the description based on the glw theory is no longer applicable to the `` vaporization '' of qsls . </S>",
    "<S> such nontrivial finite-@xmath0 phase transitions have been studied by the mean - field approximations for 3d @xmath4 qsls on the basis of the @xmath4 gauge theory  @xcite . to understand the critical properties , however , it is necessary to take into account fluctuations of a topological structure in the excitations beyond the mean - field approach . </S>",
    "<S> the current study presents the first unbiased results on topological transitions , which may give birth to a new concept of critical phenomena beyond the conventional glw theory </S>",
    "<S> .    it will also be interesting to consider the `` solidification '' of qsls . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the solid phase ( magnetically ordered phase ) is accessible in the context of the present 3d kitaev model , by considering additional interactions which favor a magnetic order , such as the heisenberg exchange interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed study of the magnetic three states of matter , liquid , gas , and solid , will provide a new insight in the research area of magnetism .    </S>",
    "<S> the present results give a counterexample to the conventional `` myth '' on qsls : the absence of phase transition is a requirement for qsl . </S>",
    "<S> this myth has long haunted the experimental identification of qsls . </S>",
    "<S> our results , however , indicate that a phase transition does not always signal symmetry breaking by a magnetic long - range order . </S>",
    "<S> this will urge reconsideration of the experimental detection of qsls ; even if the system exhibits a phase transition , it should not be excluded from the candidates for qsls , as long as a clear indication of magnetic ordering is not established .    </S>",
