    "40004000  = 1000              the observational distribution of measured velocity widths ( @xmath0 ) of  forest absorption lines may be parameterized as gaussian , but with a significant non - gaussian , high - velocity tail ( @xmath5 ; cf . for recent observational results ) .",
    "investigations based on spherical gaseous clouds bounded by external pressure @xcite find that the @xmath0-distribution can only be reproduced by a population with a strong correlation between central density , radii , and cloud mass , requiring a tight correlation between column density and @xmath0 , which has not been strongly supported by the data ( , discusses selection effects which may have produced earlier reported correlations ) .",
    "other researchers find that high implied temperatures of such clouds ( assuming @xmath6 ) can not be produced by structures in thermal equilibrium with an ionizing uv background , and may imply recent adiabatic collapse @xcite .",
    "the ramifications of cdm structure formation models as the origin of the  forest have been extensively investigated .",
    "recent workers , using hydrodynamic simulations of cosmological models ( usually cdm or @xmath7cdm ) , describe the structures responsible for the low - density ( @xmath8 )  forest to be filaments , pancakes , `` cigar - like '' , mini - pancakes , or sheets @xcite .",
    "commonly , the @xmath0-distribution is parameterized as a gaussian ; in addition , a non - gaussian high - velocity tail is universally noted .",
    "the measured @xmath0-values do not always correspond directly to a temperature , and most structure formation theories produce fluctuations in the density of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) larger ( in redshift space ) than the thermal width ( ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we describe how this high - velocity tail may be generated by the same structures responsible for the lower - velocity gaussian peak .",
    "the low - velocity ( gaussian peak ) values are caused by the line - of - sight passing nearly perpendicular to the long - axis of the sheet / filament - type structures , while the high - velocity tail is due to higher angles of incidence .",
    "the relative number of low vs. high @xmath0-values are , in this scenario , determined by the geometry of the absorbing structures , and is otherwise unrelated to the physical state of the absorbing structure .    in exploring this scenario ,",
    "we keep in mind the fact that the fluctuations which are produced in large - scale structure formation simulations are in a continuous density field , and ascribing a simplified geometry to them in the way we do ( as a cylinder , or an infinite sheet ) is an idealization of a structure which has already been observed in the simulations to be more complicated .      in this model",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath0 corresponds to the line - of - sight width of the absorbing structure in velocity space , which is determined both by its physical size in comoving space and by its peculiar velocity structure .      in the simplest manifestation ( refer to fig .  [",
    "fig : absorption ] ) , an observer s line - of - sight ( los ) crosses an absorber which has a minimum ( velocity ) width @xmath9 , and which has a long - axis .",
    "we assume that the geometry of the absorber is such that the cross section  which is the plane shared by the short - axis @xmath9 and the los , parallel to the long axis  can be described as a rectangle of width @xmath9 and quasi - infinite length .",
    "this is a fair assumption to describe cross - sections of filaments and sheets , but not of spheres .",
    "presently , we treat the long - axis as infinite , but the expected finite length would produce observationally important effects , which we discuss below .",
    "the los crosses the absorber at an angle @xmath10 to the perpendicular of @xmath9 , producing a line - of - sight crossing distance ( in velocity space ) of @xmath0 .",
    "the observed velocity - width @xmath0 is geometrically related to the short axis @xmath9 :      this is the relationship between the los velocity - width ( @xmath0 ) of the observed absorption line and the velocity - width @xmath9 of the density enhancement ( that is , filament or sheet ) .",
    "if we assume a random distribution in @xmath10 ( that is , a random orientation of absorbing structures relative to the los ) , because @xmath12 is the axis of symmetry for the cylindrical filament , the number of los per unit @xmath10 is : @xmath13        we assume a cylindrical filament , with a diameter @xmath15 ; @xmath9 then depends on an angle @xmath16 , corresponding to an impact parameter relative to the center of the cylinder s circular cross - section :      where @xmath18 when the los passes through the center of the cylinder s circular cross - section , and @xmath19 when the los passes nearly tangent to the cylinder s circular cross - section .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath9 , assuming a random distribution of impact parameters , is :          after making a change of variables of @xmath22 , converting the integrating variable from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , and replacing @xmath25 , the integral is in a tabulated form ( , 200.01 and 202.01 ) .",
    "once integrated , we find the distribution of velocity - widths @xmath0 to be : @xmath26   & { \\bbar } >   1 \\\\          \\frac{1}{2l}\\left [ ( 1 + \\frac{1}{\\bbar^2 } ) \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\bbar + 1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\bbar^2}}\\right ) - \\frac{1}{\\bbar}\\right ]   &   { \\bbar } <   1       \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    this is the normalized @xmath0-distribution function for an ensemble of cylindrical filaments of velocity - diameter @xmath15 , oriented randomly with respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "this distribution function is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdist]a , super - imposed on combined datasets 1 + 3 + 5 ( see table  [ tab : datasets ] ) . the distribution is sharply peaked , with a broader wing at lower - velocities than at higher velocities .",
    "it is a very poor description of the data near the gaussian peak , indicating that , at the very least , a distribution of @xmath15 values must be imposed .      plus",
    "higher order terms .",
    "thus , the differential distribution of los velocities at values greater than the velocity diameter of the cylinder decreases as an inverse cube of the measured velocity . because this decrease is a power - law , integrating over a distribution in @xmath15 will not change it s power - law nature at @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the largest contributing @xmath15 value ) .      which is the fraction of @xmath0 values expected to be larger than some value @xmath0 , for a known value of @xmath15 .",
    "the median is @xmath31 ( that is , @xmath32 ) .",
    "approximately eighty per cent of the @xmath0 values are between 0.5 and 2.0 of the median . at the high velocity end ( @xmath33 ) , the cumulative @xmath0-distribution decreases as @xmath34 , as expected . we show this cumulative distribution for an assumed @xmath35 , super - imposed on datasets 1 + 3 + 5 ( see table  [ tab : datasets ] ) , in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdist]b .",
    "the power - nature of the cumulative distribution at @xmath3628  is apparent , and is comparable to that seen in the dataset .",
    "( we comment on the possibility of a break in the data near @xmath37  in sec  [ sec : break ] , where we statistically compare the observed distribution with a power - law distribution ) .",
    "the differential distribution for sheets may be found similarly to cylinders .",
    "the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath9 ( the short axis velocity ) is as in eq .",
    "[ eq : b ] , where again we refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : absorption ] .",
    "however , the axis of symmetry for the sheet is now perpendicular to the surface of the sheet , and the number of los per angle @xmath10 changes accordingly ( compare with eq .",
    "[ eq : cyltheta ] ) :      this is the important difference with the filament distribution .",
    "we assume a delta - function distribution of @xmath9(=@xmath15  the width of the sheet ) . by chain rule ,",
    "the differential @xmath0-distribution is :          thus , the differential distribution expected from sheets is @xmath41 , and the cumulative distribution is @xmath42 .",
    "the differential distribution is non - zero only at @xmath36l  and thus is truncated at the sheet - width .      the dependence of the @xmath0 distribution @xmath43 or @xmath44 may be present in existing data - sets . in this section , we perform a few comparisons between the data and power - law @xmath0-distributions .",
    "these comparisons may be hampered by contributions to line - measurements of line - blending ( when 2 or more individual lines can not be statistically decomposed , and thus the properties of only one , broader , blended line is measured ) , and also to the sensitivity of the detection measurement algorithms to lines of these velocity widths .",
    "we have assumed that the measurement algorithms are 100% efficient .",
    "we used data from three recently published studies of the  forest absorbers @xcite .",
    "from these , we have used only lines with measured column densities @xmath45 , and @xmath3 . using a ks - test @xcite",
    ", we determine the probability that data from these observations are consistent with having been drawn from a differential distribution with a single - power - law , for a range of power - law values in 0.05 increments .",
    "we tested each data - set individually ( datasets 2 , 4 , and 6 , see table  [ tab : datasets ] ) , producing 99.5% confidence limits ( where the dataset has a 0.5% probability of being drawn from a parent distribution with that power - law value ) .",
    "the results of these are shown in table  [ tab : datasets ] .",
    "the combination of all three datasets ( dataset 7 ) places limits on a single - value - power - law parent population for the differential distribution with a power - law between [ @xmath46 .",
    "the combined data - set is inconsistent with a single - value power - law @xmath1 at 99.99% confidence , and inconsistent with @xmath2 at ( @xmath47)% confidence .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdist]b , there is what looks like an apparent break from a single power - law in the data near @xmath37 . in a combined dataset from all three observations , using values of @xmath48 , we find the 99.5% upper - limit on the power - law slope is @xmath49 ( the lower - limit is @xmath50 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the range found for @xmath51 ( [ -4.55,-2.05 ] , 99.5% confidence range , drawn from dataset 7 ; 346 lines ) .",
    "thus , the break is not statistically significant . [",
    "sec : break ]      we have described a model in which we have assumed the absorbing structures of the  forest may be idealized as infinite sheets and cylinders in velocity space . in this model ,",
    "the measured los velocity width @xmath0 is due to the line - of - sight size in velocity space of the absorbing structure , determined both by its physical size in comoving space and by its peculiar velocity structure . assuming a random orientation of these structures relative to the los , a high - velocity - tail to the distribution of los velocity widths of the  forest",
    "is produced .",
    "this tail is due to the chance occurrence of a los passing close to the long - axis , making the total traverse distance much longer than that of a los which passes nearly perpendicular to the long axis .",
    "the differential distribution due to an ensemble of infinite cylinders ( sheets ) shows a dependence @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the shape of the @xmath15-distribution ( the characteristic size of the structure ) will dominate the observational @xmath0-distribution at low values (  @xmath54 ) .",
    "thus , in this model the gaussian which is observed in the velocity range @xmath5510 - 40 km  is largely due to the shape of the @xmath15 distribution , while the high - velocity tail is due to the line - of - sight penetrating absorbing structures close to their long - axis .",
    "the single power - law differential @xmath0-distribution of @xmath56 for cylinders and @xmath44 for sheets should continue up to values of @xmath57 only if these structures are infinitely long .",
    "this is almost certainly not the case . at high values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the distribution should break from these power - laws , due to the finite size of the absorbing structures .    a comparison with a combined dataset of 447 lines with @xmath3635  places limits on the value of the power - law distribution , with @xmath58}$ ] ( 99.5% confidence limits ) . a pure power - law @xmath59 is excluded at a probability of @xmath60 while @xmath61 is excluded at @xmath62 .",
    "under this model , including values of @xmath0 toward lower velocities ( @xmath63 ) could bias the power - law toward more negative values ; however , using a dataset consisting only of higher velocities ( @xmath48 ) the data are even more inconsistent with @xmath43",
    ". therefore such low-@xmath0 contamination can not be responsible for the inconsistency between the observational data and the predicted power - law dependency .",
    "the effects of finite - length sheets and filaments may be responsible for the steepness of this power - law .",
    "further work on the observational limits of such a break could provide a direct measurement of the size of these structures .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations can play an important role in predicting the form and magnitude of this break , providing observers with the tools they need to find it .",
    "in conclusion , modeling the absorbing structures of the igm responsible for the  forest as infinite cylindrical filaments and sheets in velocity space predicts power - law @xmath0-distributions  which predict more observed high-@xmath0 lines than are reported in the observations .",
    "this can be due to several causes , among them the finite - size of such structures , a decreasing detection efficiency with increasing @xmath0 , or that the geometric idealization here presented does not accurately reflect the physical system .",
