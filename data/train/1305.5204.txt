    "<S> the absolute spectra differ due to the ( slightly ) different absolute values of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 coefficients .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , our first - principles lda+dmft calculations predict the existence of a pressure- and temperature- induced orbital transition in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 . at this transition , </S>",
    "<S> the 4@xmath3 electron weight is transferred from cf state @xmath18 ( the atomic ground - state for vanishing hybridization ) to the excited level @xmath19 , because the latter hybridizes more strongly with conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> our results lead to clear - cut predictions for spectroscopic experiments like nixs , where the fingerprint of the orbital transition can be detected in momentum - transfer dependent scattering cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> a similar `` meta - orbital '' transition between two cf levels with different hybridizations has been recently discussed in the context of a two - band periodical anderson model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has not been , to our knowledge , demonstrated from _ ab initio _ simulations of any real heavy - fermion material . </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to speculate that the critical fluctuations associated with this orbital transition are responsible for the pairing in the high - pressure sc dome of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 and iso - electronic cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the calculated critical pressure of 2.5 gpa at zero temperature is rather close to the experimental maximum of this dome . </S>",
    "<S> similar orbital transitions between cf levels may also explain the superconductivity away from magnetic quantum points in other hf compounds </S>",
    "<S> . it will be interesting to investigate whether such orbital transitions are always related to a double - dome sc or whether they can as well occur in single - dome and non - sc hf compounds ( e.g. cepd@xmath0si@xmath0 , ceal@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we finally note that ` composite pairing ' sc has been proposed theoretically  @xcite to arise at the boundary between two distinct hf liquids originating in two orthogonal cf levels . </S>",
    "<S> we acknowledge discussions with d.  jaccard , who attracted our attention to this problem , as well as with j .- p .  </S>",
