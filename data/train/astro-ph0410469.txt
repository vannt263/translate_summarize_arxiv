    "pattern speed ( @xmath6 ) is defined as an angular rotation velocity of spiral pattern . according to the spiral density wave theory @xcite",
    ", @xmath6 determines the location and even the existence of resonances , which would greatly affect the morphology and kinematics of a galaxy .",
    "the results of numerical simulations also show the large dependence of spiral structure on @xmath6 @xcite . despite its importance on the study of galaxies",
    ", it can not be determined directly from observations , since the pattern structure is not a material but a density wave propagating through the disk .",
    "several methods have been proposed to date for the determination of pattern speed .",
    "@xcite presented the method using the continuity equation for the surface brightness of galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that the residual velocity field , obtained by subtracting the axisymmetric component from observed velocity field , has a difference in pattern between the inside and outside of the corotation .",
    "@xcite pointed out that where the arm to interarm ratio of star formation efficiency has a sharp dip could be thought as the corotation .",
    "these methods work well for some galaxies , but there are still inconsistencies or large uncertainties .      in this letter , we examined offsets between h@xmath2 and co arms of a spiral galaxy .",
    "we suggest that we can use them as a new method for the determination of pattern speed and typical timescale for star formation .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission is the tracer of hii region , which surrounds newly born massive stars , while the co emission is the tracer of molecular gas . according to the galactic shock wave theory @xcite ,",
    "most molecular clouds are formed and then condensed by the compression owing to the spiral shock wave and thus belong to the spiral arm .",
    "since galactic scale star formations take place in these molecular arms , some molecular gases are used to form stars , and the others are dissociated by uv emission from massive stars born in that star formation . in consequence , molecular clouds disappear soon after their formation and their position appears to be fixed to the spiral pattern , though individual molecular clouds move at the speed of gas .",
    "therefore , the position of spiral pattern and h@xmath2 arm can be measured by using that of a molecular arm and an ensemble of hii regions respectively . in other words ,",
    "offset between the arms of h@xmath2 and co represents the difference between the speed of gas and spiral pattern , as well as the time needed for star formation from molecular clouds .",
    "this offset has been found in many spiral galaxies ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) . we can easily see it in a @xmath11-band image as a displacement of an arm s peak and a dust lane , since the light of @xmath11-band is mainly emitted by the young ob star and the distribution of dust lane and molecular gas are almost the same .",
    "however , this offset has not been studied quantitatively yet , since the resolution of the co image was too large to examine detail structures of spiral arms .",
    "we assume that the pattern of spiral is rigid , and that the gas rotates in circular orbit .",
    "then we define a timescale @xmath7 as an _ average _ time for h@xmath2 arm to develop from a galactic - shock - compressed molecular arm .",
    "if the physical processes of star formation are not extremely different in the spiral disk , this timescale can be regarded as a constant parameter representing a typical value of the entire disk .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)draw.ps    figure [ fig.draw ] illustrates this idea for the inside of the cr . if we observe a face - on spiral galaxy at @xmath12 ( the left panel ) , at @xmath13 the same galaxy will be observed as the right panel and the offset distance between the arms of h@xmath2 and co , @xmath14 , can be written as @xmath15 } , \\label{eq.d}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the velocity of gas , and @xmath17 is the velocity of pattern .",
    "we adopt this expression , in which @xmath14 becomes a positive value , since most of molecules exist in a rather central part of the disk and thus they seem to be in the inside of the cr .",
    "if molecular gas is more extended and the outside of the cr should be taken into account , h@xmath2 arm will be seen on the concave side of co arm and @xmath14 will be negative .    dividing both sides of equation ( [ eq.d ] ) by radius @xmath18 [ kpc ]",
    ", we obtain @xmath19 } , \\label{eq.ofst}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath3 is the azimuthal offset .",
    "this equation shows the relation between two observables , @xmath4 and @xmath3 , and we can rewrite it as @xmath22 where @xmath3 is in degree and @xmath7 is in @xmath23 yr .",
    "if we assume that @xmath7 is constant in a certain range of radius in a galaxy , @xmath3 becomes a linear function of @xmath4 , since we assume the rigid pattern , in other words , constant @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , by plotting @xmath3 against @xmath4 and fitting them with a line , both @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be determined at the same time .",
    "in addition , the linearity of this plot can verify the validity of the assumptions we made .",
    "we discuss this validity in section 4 .",
    "we observed a sac galaxy ngc 4254 in the @xmath0co ( @xmath1=1 - 0 ) line using nobeyama millimeter array during a long - term project , `` virgo high resolution co survey '' @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolution is about 2 arcsec , which corresponds to @xmath24 pc at a distance from the virgo cluster of 16.1 mpc .",
    "this resolution is small enough to trace the spiral arms with typical width of 1 kpc . for more detailed information about this galaxy and the co observation ,",
    "see @xcite .    @xcite presented broadband _",
    "r _ and narrowband h@xmath2 images of 63 spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "the resolution of the image is 1.2 arcsec , comparable to that of our co data .",
    "we determined the coordinate of the h@xmath2 image using the galactic stars seen in the _ r _ band image , since these two images had the same field of view .",
    "the typical uncertainty of this coordinate fitting is about 1 arcsec , smaller than the resolution of the images .",

    "see the following paragraph for detail . ) and has well - ordered spiral arms ( classified as arm class 9 by @xcite ) , so that the spiral structure can be easily traced .",
    "this is why we selected this galaxy to examine offsets between h@xmath2 and co arms",
    ".    position angle ( p.a . ) and inclination ( _ i _ ) are also important parameters of a galaxy .",
    "we determined them applying the task gal of aips to the velocity field of co. this task cuts annuli out from a velocity field , and fits them with a pure circular rotation velocity field in order to derive p.a . and _ i _ at each radius .",

    "filled boxes and circles are the peaks of h@xmath2 and co intensity , respectively .",
    "see the following section for detail .",
    "we divided the phase diagram into strips of 200 pc radial width , averaged the intensity with respect to radius at each azimuth in each strip , and plotted the averaged intensity against azimuth .",
    "we defined an offset angle @xmath3 as an azimuthal angular separation of intensity peaks between the h@xmath2 and co arms .",
    "since arms of this galaxy are not totally continuous and have some breaks , we could not find corresponding peaks at some radii .",
    "in addition , we only used the range of 1 kpc @xmath27 2.6 kpc , since the spiral feature is not clear in the inner region and the rotation curve has a large dispersion in the outer region ( see figure [ fig.rc ] ) . in figure",

    "the largest factor for the error in @xmath3 is the resolution of co data , which is about 2 arcsec .",
    "thus this error is written as @xmath30}. \\label{eq.delta}\\ ] ] in addition , the uncertainty of the coordinate fitting of h@xmath2 image and the fact that the determination of offset angles is somewhat subjective would also be possible sources of error in @xmath3 . we , however , neglected these errors for the simplicity of calculations , so that the error in @xmath3 could be larger than the value obtained from equation ( [ eq.delta ] ) by a factor of 2 at most .",
    "we plotted the derived offsets against @xmath4 , derived from rotation curve ( figure [ fig.chi_fit ] ) .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fit.eps    errorbars in offset angle are @xmath31 , calculated from equation ( [ eq.delta ] ) at each radius .",
    "we used the @xmath32-square fitting method and obtained @xmath9 yr and @xmath10 .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig.chi_fit ] is the fitted line , and the gradient and horizontal - axis - intercept of this line corresponds to the resultant value of @xmath7 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "@xcite showed that the corotation radius for the same galaxy is about 7.5 kpc from numerical simulations , and corresponding @xmath6 is about 20 @xmath33 .",
    "they assumed the distance to the galaxy as 20 mpc .",
    "if we adjust this result to the distance of 16.1 mpc , @xmath6 should be about 25 @xmath33 . the typical timescale of star formation has been suggested as about @xmath23 yr from the calculation of jeans time in molecular clouds .",
    "our results are in good agreement with these previous studies .      in our method",
    ", we assumed a pure circular rotation and a constant time delay for star formation from molecular clouds , and we did not do any correction for extinction in h@xmath2 data .",
    "we however know that deviations from these assumptions are not critically large . the streaming motion and the velocity dispersion would generate some non - circular motion , but in a spiral disk , these are usually about 10 km s@xmath34 @xcite , which is very small compared to the circular rotation velocity of @xmath35 km s@xmath34 .",
    "the validity of the latter assumption , constant @xmath7 , can be checked by the linearity of @xmath36 plot ( figure [ fig.chi_fit ] ) . since this plot is well fitted with a line , dependence of @xmath7 on the environment should be small and included in the error of the derived value .",
    "the extinction of h@xmath2 is surely significant to luminosity and this might lead us to overestimate the offset values , since the amount of extinction becomes larger as hii regions get closer to molecular arms and an h@xmath2 arm thus seems to shift to the downstream side from where it really is .",
    "@xcite showed azimuthal brightness profiles of ngc 4254 in @xmath37- , @xmath38- , and @xmath39-band image at r=@xmath40 ( figure 20 in their paper ) .",
    "though the shape of profile is different from one to another , the positions of peak brightness are well consistent among them .",
    "hence , we can assume that the extinction would hardly change the position of h@xmath2 arms and neglect the effect of extinction on the offset values .",
    "we examined the offset between the arm of h@xmath2 and co of sac galaxy ngc 4254 , derived ten offset values and found the linear relation between the offset angle and the angular rotation velocity .",
    "this linearity implies that a rigid spiral pattern exists and that the physical processes of star formation can be regarded as not to extremely change in the disk .",
    "we emphasize that this is the first work to show this relationship .",
    "with this relation , we derived the pattern speed @xmath41 , and the time delay for star formation @xmath9 yr .",
    "we again emphasize that we can derive both @xmath6 and @xmath7 simultaneously .",
    "since the obtained values are consistent with previous studies , the way of our analysis can be a new method for the determination of the pattern speed and the typical timescale needed for star formations .",
    "thus , this method can investigate not only the kinematics , but also the star formation mechanisms quantitatively .",
    "moreover , this method can be applied to many spiral galaxies , since offsets between h@xmath2 and co arms have been found in many spirals .",
