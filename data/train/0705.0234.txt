    "blazars represent the most active side of active galactic nuclei due to a priviledged aspect angle enhancing the emission from the jet with respect to that from the accretion disk .",
    "the strongly variable non - thermal continuum , extending from the radio to the high - energy @xmath7rays , produced within the jet ( with bulk lorentz factors @xmath8 ) is strongly amplified in the forward direction by relativistic beaming .",
    "the short variability timescale ( down to hours ) indicates that the emission region must be located quite close to the central engine , at distances of the order of 0.010.1 pc .",
    "therefore , studying emission from blazars we can probe the physical state of the jet close to its base , allowing important insights on the physical mechanism able to produce such extreme structures . the double - humped spectral energy distribution displayed by blazars ( sambruna et al .",
    "1996 , fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) is generally described in terms of synchrotron ( contributing from the radio to the uv - x - ray range ) and inverse compton ( extending from x - rays to @xmath6-rays ) emission from a single population of relativistic electrons ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "the peaks of the two components show a clear trend with the total emitted power ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) . for low power sources",
    "( bolometric luminosity @xmath9 erg / s ) the synchrotron peak falls in the uv - x - rays and the ic peak in the multi gev - tev range . in high power sources ( bolometric luminosity @xmath10 erg / s ) ,",
    "the synchrotron peak is located in the submm - fir band , while the ic component , usually dominating the total radiative output , peaks in the mev - gev region . thus in low - luminosity blazars ( mostly bl lac objects ) x - rays probe the high energy end of the synchrotron component allowing the investigation of the dynamics of high - energy electrons , while for powerful blazars ( belonging to the fsrq class ) the x - ray emission is produced via the ic process by relatively low energy electrons .",
    "the study of the x - ray portion of the seds of fsrq is crucial for different reasons .",
    "first of all , the hard x - ray spectrum of fsrq is generally attributed to the ic radiation produced by low - energy electrons scattering ambient photons ( external compton emission ) .",
    "its investigation offers the only possibility to probe directly the low energy portion of the electron distribution which is essential for estimating the total power of the jet ( e.g. , maraschi & tavecchio 2003 ) and is unaccessible at radio frequencies because of self - absorption .",
    "moreover , the slope of the x - ray continuum , directly connected to the slope of the underlying population of low - energy electrons , can provide important constraints on the acceleration mechanisms acting on the relativistic electrons .",
    "a good description of the continuum requires broad band observations ( 0.1 - 100 kev ) .",
    "unfortunately , few fsrqs have high statistics above 10 kev , most of them obtained in the past decade with the pds instruments onboard @xmath11sax ( e.g. , tavecchio et al . 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "the joint fit of the medium ( 2 - 10 kev ) and the hard ( above 10 kev ) x - ray data revealed in same cases the presence of very hard spectra , with slopes @xmath12 above 23 kev ( here and in the following @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 ) .",
    "these results have been recently extended using observations with _ swift _ ( sambruna et al . 2006a , 2007 ) ,",
    "although in these cases the data in the hard x - rays represent averages over months .",
    "the presence of such hard spectra is difficult to reconcile with the standard picture considering the formation of power law distributions through shock acceleration or cooling of high energy electrons ( e.g. , sikora et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the medium - soft x - ray spectrum may reveal the very low end of the ec component and therefore of the relativistic electron spectrum . around these energies",
    "a `` break '' is expected in the ec emission which is the `` footprint '' of the thermal photon population . while above the break the slope of the spectrum is connected to the slope of the electron distribution , below the break the slope of the spectrum",
    "should instead reveal the spectral distribution of the ambient photons .",
    "similar `` convex '' spectra have in fact been observed in some intermediate redshift fsrqs ( e.g. , tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "an important consequence of the detection of such a break is the determination of the mimimum lorentz factor of the emitting electrons , a key parameter for the determination of the kinetic power carried by the jet ( e.g. , celotti & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "however , the situation can be more complex , with the simultaneous presence in this band of different components , such as the synchrotron self - compton emission and , as recently pointed out by celotti , ghisellini & fabian ( 2007 ) , the spectral components originating from the `` bulk comptonization '' of ambient photons by _ cold _ electrons in the jet .",
    "the interpretation of the shape of the soft x - ray continuum is not unique .",
    "in fact , in several high - redshift blazars ( @xmath15 ; e.g. , yuan et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) the steepening of the soft x - ray spectrum is interpreted in terms of absorption by a dense region of ( warm ) plasma ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) present in the region surrounding the qso ( expected to be in the form of a wind / outflow , e.g. , fabian 1999 ) .",
    "if confirmed , the presence of this large amount of absorbing gas in the vicinity of the jet , would have strong consequences for the structure of the jet and its interaction with the ism .",
    "an excellent laboratory to address most of the issues discussed above is the fsrqs rbs  315 ( from the rosat bright survey , schwope et al .",
    "2000 ; also known as gb6  j0225 + 1846 , @xmath0 ) , for which a previous _ xmm - newton _ observation revealed the presence of an extremely hard x - ray continuum ( photon index @xmath16 , page et al .",

    "swift_. in the following we report the data analysis ( sec.2 ) , the results ( sec.3 ) and the modelling of the derived seds ( sec.4 ) .",
    "the discussion is given in sec.5 , where we explore in particular the possibility that the convex spectrum reflects the _ intrinsic _ curvature of the ic component .",

    "we remind that the model can not reproduce the emission in the radio band since the source is opaque in this band due to synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the radio emission is generally assumed to originate from larger regions of the jet , downstream to the blazar region .",
    "the ic process involves both the synchrotron photons ( synchrotron self - compton , maraschi et al .",

    "1994 ] ) entering the jet ( external compton ) . in sources like rbs  315 the ec emission dominate the high - energy component , while the ssc component could contribute in the soft x - ray band .    in the case in which the ambient photons are dominated by the emission from the blr",
    "clouds it is customary to model the external photon spectrum with a black body shape peaking around @xmath57 hz ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "although rather crude , the ic spectra derived from this approximation reproduces quite well more refined spectra calculated taking into account the exact shape of the blr spectrum ( tavecchio et al .",

    "unfortunately we could not found useful information on @xmath60 , the luminosity of the emission lines of this source .",
    "therefore we indirectly fix @xmath60 assuming that optical - uv emission directly measure the disk luminosity , @xmath61 , and that a fraction @xmath62 of the disk emission is reprocessed by the blr ( this is consistent with the results obtained for the few sources in which a measure of the disk and line luminosity is simultaneously available , e.g. , sambruna et al .",
    "the luminosity - radius relations for the blr ( kaspi et al .",

    "these large radii would imply small @xmath58 .",
    "however , the validity of these relations in these extreme regimes is not tested . moreover , besides the blr radiation , we may have the radiation coming directly from the accretion disk and/or isotropized by intercloud scattering material .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath64 cm , which implies a relatively large radiation energy density .",
    "the models are reported in figs.([sedall])-([sedallabs ] ) and the model parameters are reported in tab.([parameters ] ) , together with the derived jet radiative luminosity and jet power ( see the discussion ) .",
    "we report the models calculated both in the case of the x - ray spectrum measured by _ xmm - newton _ in 2003 and that derived by in 2006 .    in fig .",
    "( [ sedall ] ) we report the models for the _ c _ case ( the insert shows a zoom on the x - ray band ) . the high - energy emission , from x - rays to @xmath7-rays , is dominated by the ec component .",
    "this can be approximately described by three power laws : 1 ) an extremely hard power law below a `` break frequency '' @xmath65 hz ( where @xmath66 hz , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , values typically derived in these sources , e.g. , tavecchio et al .",

    "3 ) a steeper power law with slope @xmath72 up to the frequency @xmath73 .",
    "we remark that the steepening of the spectrum below @xmath70 is _ required _ by the standard emission models for this kind of sources , although the precise shape and position of the break depends on the jet parameters and on the assumed underlying ambient photon population ( tavecchio et al .",
    ", in prep ) . in particular , the slope below @xmath70 reflects the shape of the underlying soft photons . using the black - body approximation",
    "the resulting spectrum is @xmath74 .",
    "the slope of the power law above @xmath70 , @xmath75 , is fixed by the measured slope of the power - law derived from the fitting of the x - ray data .",

    "we report the predicted _ glast _ 5@xmath81 sensitivity ( long - dashed curve ) calculated for 1 year all - sky survey .",
    "the models for the case of intrinsic absorption are reported in fig.([sedallabs ] ) . in this case",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the source is a power - law extending down to lower energy . to correctly reproduce this spectrum we decrease the bulk lorentz factor with respect to the previous case ( to @xmath82 ) , so that the hard tail falls outside the region probed by the data .",
    "we compensated the lower degree of beaming with a larger electron density , with the effect to increase the relative importance of the ssc emission , which fills the region between the optical - uv and the soft x - ray band .    in both cases the x - ray spectrum",
    "can be well fitted by assuming a standard slope @xmath83 for the low energy branch of the electron energy distribution .",
    "on the other hand , the extremely hard x - ray continuum measured by _ xmm - newton _ requires a rather flat distribution ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "apart for the change of @xmath52 , the transition between the state of 2003 to that of 2006 can be reproduced with small changes in the other parameters , in particular a slightly larger value of the magnetic field .",
    "both the and the data of rbs  315 show a clear hardening of the x - ray spectrum below 1 kev , equally well fitted by a power - law model with absorption in excess to the galactic value or by a broken - power law continuum with galactic absorption .",
    "this feature , observed in several high-@xmath85 quasars , is commonly ascribed to the presence of absorbing material in the quasar environment ( e.g. , elvis et al .",

    "2006 ) , suggesting that absorption is linked to the presence of a relativistic jet . however , as pointed out by page et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , if the @xmath86 correlation is real , the fact that radio - loud sources appear to be more absorbed could simply be due to a selection effect , since radio - loud quasars are brighter in x - rays and can be observed at larger distances .",
    "we note that a substantial number of the high @xmath85 radio loud quasars are in fact blazars , i.e. observed at small angle to the jet axis as is the case for rbs  315 and the very hard x - ray spectra indicate that their emission is dominated by the jet .",
    "a potentially severe problem of the absorption interpretation is the apparent absence of strong extinction in the optical - uv band .",
    "indeed , with the column densities inferred from the x - ray spectral fits , in some cases reaching values of @xmath87 @xmath3 ( fabian et al .",
    "2001a ) , the corresponding obscuration would be huge ( @xmath88 ) , in contrast with the optical observations requiring rather small reddening .",
    "a solution to this discrepancy is to invoke an extreme gas to dust ratio in these sources , possibly due to the high - ionization state of the gas ( as the warm absorber found in seyfert galaxies ) .",
    "however , the evidence of the high - ionization state from the fits of the x - ray spectra is not conclusive , even with good quality data ( e.g. worsley et al .",
    "2004a , b ) . in fact , due to the redshift , the most important features that can be used for the diagnostics move below 0.1 kev and can not be observed .",
    "the discussion above is based on the assumption that the hardening at low energies is due to ( intrinsic ) absorption in both radio - quiet and radio - loud sources .",
    "however in radio - loud sources , and in particular in blazars , the observed spectral shape could be _ naturally _ accounted for by the intrinsic curvature of the ic emission from the jet , as shown here for the case of rbs  315 ( see also fabian et al .",
    "2001a ; sambruna et al . 2006a , 2007 ) .",
    "indeed , for parameters typically derived in reproducing the sed of powerful blazars , the model predicts a smooth hardening of the spectrum below a few kev ( in the rest frame ) . to better illustrate this point",
    ", we show in fig.([compa ] ) the comparison between the ec spectrum ( solid line ) and an absorbed power law spectrum ( dashed ) for an intrinsic column density @xmath89 @xmath3 ( calculated using the zwabs model of xspec ) , for a source located at @xmath90 ( energies are in the observer frame ) . as already discussed , the ec spectrum present a break at a frequency approximately given by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the peak frequency of the external radiation field . to mimic an effective column density one has therefore to adjust the parameters to obtain the right value for the break frequency .",
    "for instance , the curve reported in fig.([compa ] ) have been calculated assuming @xmath93 hz and fixing the low - energy end of the electron distribution to @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , @xmath70 is fixed only by the value of the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "as can be seen , the shapes of the two kinds of spectra are substantially similar down to energies of 0.3 - 0.4 kev ( but this energy is lower for sources at higher @xmath85 ) . below that energy",
    ", the ec curve stays systematically above the absorbed power - law , since it asymptotically reaches a spectrum @xmath95 ( reproducing the slope of the underlying population of soft photons , assumed to follow a black - body shape ) , while the absorption imprints an exponential cut - off .",
    "however , with data covering a limited energy range the two models can give equally acceptable fits .",
    "the hardening of the ec spectrum at low energies could be masked by the possible presence of the softer ssc component , which typically peaks between the uv and the soft x - ray band .",
    "however , from the observational point of view ( e.g. fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) the relative importance of the ssc component seems to decrease with the power of the source ( maybe due to an increasing importance of the accretion disk and then of the external radiation field : e.g. , celotti et al .",
    "2007 ) , leaving an almost `` naked '' ec component in the most powerful sources . in this case , the apparent effect of the absorption should be more important for the most powerful sources , accounting for the apparent trend of the @xmath26 with @xmath85 ( since for high redshift we select the most powerful sources ) .",
    "in conclusion , in radio - loud , blazar - like , quasars , the intrinsic curvature of the ec component is a viable alternative to explain the cut - off in the soft x - ray band .",
    "clearly , more observational effort should be devoted to study this effect .",
    "the most direct observation able to discriminate between the two possible explanations would be the direct detection of features ( i.e. absorption edges ) directly imprinted on the x - ray continuum by the absorbing material .",
    "spectra with sufficient signal can possibly be obtained with long exposures with the present instrumentation . in any case",
    ", this can be one of the goals of the next generation of x - ray instruments .",
    "moreover , it is mandatory to investigate the detailed shape of soft the x - ray continuum expected by considering realistic spectra for the soft ambient photons scattered in the ec component ( tavecchio et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "besides the problems related to the cut - off at low energies , the quite hard x - ray spectrum of rbs  315 above 1 kev ( similar to that of other powerful blazars ) poses a great challenge to the scenarios currently accepted for particle acceleration ( ghisellini 1996 , sikora et al .",
    "2002 ) . indeed , to correctly reproduce the x - ray continuum we have to assume @xmath55 ( especially for the observations ) .",
    "however , a slope @xmath96 for the electron energy distribution ( implying a spectral index @xmath97 ) is predicted in scenarios considering either shock accelerated electrons or a population of cooled electrons . particularly difficult to be reconciled with the standard models",
    "is the exceptionally hard slope measured by in 2003 .",
    "note , moreover , that such hard spectra are not uncommon .",
    "for instance , in the sample of 16 radio - loud quasars at @xmath98 considered by page et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , 4 have hard spectra with @xmath99 .",
    "this evidence could suggest either that shocks can produce relativistic electrons with a distribution much harder than @xmath96 or that another mechanism energizes the electrons , at least those with lorentz factors below @xmath100 ( which typically emits through ec at energies below 100 kev ) .",
    "this possibility has been discussed by sikora et al .",
    "( 2002 ) which proposed a two - step acceleration process . in this scenario",
    ", electrons are initially accelerated from thermal energies to relativistic ones by a stochastic process ( involving , for instance plasma instabilities / turbulence or following magnetic reconnection events ) , thought to provide electron distributions harder than @xmath96 .",
    "only those particles with energies above a threshold can effectively be accelerated by the fermi process at the shock front at energies at which they can emit @xmath7-rays .",
    "however these speculations need to be assessed by improved theoretical analysis and calculations .",
    "another interesting point concerns the variability .",
    "although extremely variable in the @xmath7-rays , fsrq show little variability in the x - ray band on small timescales ( days ) . on longer timescales ( @xmath101months ) variability",
    "is observed , but the variations are usually small , both in flux and slope ( see , for instance , the comparison reported in sambruna et al .",
    "2007 ) . only in few cases extreme",
    "variability has been observed both on long ( e.g. , pian et al . 2006 ) and short ( e.g. , foschini et al .",
    "2006b ) timescales . rbs  315 changes the slope of the x - ray spectrum from @xmath102 to 1.5 between the two observations , separated by 3 years .",
    "an interesting point to note is that the spectrum seems to change `` pivoting '' around 1 kev ( see fig.[sedall],[sedallabs ] ) .",
    "sources displaying a behaviour similar to rbs  315 are rx j1028.6 - 0844 ( @xmath103 ) , for which two observations separated by one year show a change of the photon index from @xmath104 to 1.5 ( yuan et al .",
    "2005 ) , and 0836 + 710 , for which the hard x - ray spectrum ( 20 - 200 kev ) softens from @xmath105 ( as measured by _ bepposax _ ) to @xmath106 ( _ bat / swift _ ) ( sambruna et al .",
    "2007 ) .      in tab.[parameters ]",
    "we also report the radiative luminosity , @xmath107 , and the power carried by the jet , @xmath108 , calculated assuming the presence of 1 proton for each relativistic electron .",
    "this choice is dictated by the condition that the jet carries enough power to support the large radiative output of these sources ( e.g. maraschi & tavecchio 2003 ) .",
    "the derived values are around @xmath109 erg / s , quite large , but consistent with the values inferred for sources of similar radiative luminosity ( e.g. tavecchio et al . 2000 ) . the ratio @xmath110 , indicating the radiative efficiency of the jet , spans the range 10 - 50 , again , typical for this kind of sources ( e.g. sambruna et al .",
    "2006b ) .    in the hypothesis that the disk substantially contributes to the optical - uv luminosity , one can derive the disk luminosity , @xmath44 erg / s .",
    "as already discussed for other powerful blazars , in the case of the standard value of @xmath111 for the accretion efficiency , this would imply that the jet carries away a power comparable to that carried inward by the accretion flow ( rawlings & saunders 1991 , celotti et al .",
    "1997 , maraschi & tavecchio 2003 ) .",
    "finally we note that even if the black hole is accreting at the eddington limit , the large luminosity requires an extreme value for its mass , @xmath112 @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath114 the analysis of the spectrum of rbs  315 confirms the finding of page et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and piconcelli & guainazzi ( 2005 ) made using data on the presence of a cut - off in the soft - x - ray spectrum . this can be fitted equally well either using a power - law with absorption in excess of the galactic value or a broken power - law with galactic absorption .",
    "@xmath114 the very hard spectrum measured by ( photon index @xmath115 ) poses a difficult challenge to the models usually considered for the acceleration of relativistic electrons . during the observation , however , the slope was steeper , @xmath4 , closer to more `` standard '' values .",
    "@xmath114 the sed , constructed with historical radio data , optical - uv data obtained with _",
    "uvot _ and the x - ray data , is consistent with those usually derived for other intermediate / high-@xmath85 powerful blazars , usually shining in the @xmath7-ray band .",
    "it is thus likely that rbs  315 will be detected by the upcoming _ glast _ satellite .",
    "@xmath114 through the modeling of the sed with the standard synchrotron+ic emission model for blazars we derive parameters typical for powerful blazars .",
    "however , the lack of the @xmath7-ray detection prevent a firm constraint of all the parameters .",
    "@xmath114 we showed that the cut - off in the soft x - ray band , commonly ascribed to absorption by material in the quasar environment , can be also naturally reproduced by the hard tail of the ic component .",
    "further studies are required to distinguish between the two alternatives .",
