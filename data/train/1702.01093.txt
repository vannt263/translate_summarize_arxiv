    "optimal control problems are usually solved with the help of the famous pontryagin maximum principle ( pmp ) , which provides a generalization of the classical euler  lagrange and weierstrass necessary optimality conditions of the calculus of variations and is one of the central results of the mathematics of the xx century @xcite . on the other hand , fractional ( noninteger order ) derivatives play an increasing role in mathematics , physics and engineering @xcite .",
    "the two subjects have recently been put together and a theory of the calculus of variations and optimal control that deals with more general systems containing noninteger order derivatives is now available : see the books @xcite . in particular ,",

    ", the notion of fuzzy set has been widely spread to various research areas , such as linear programming , optimization , differential equations and even fractional differential equations @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of a fuzzy optimal control theory forms a suitable setting for the mathematical modelling of real world problems in which uncertainties or vagueness pervade @xcite . in the past few decades ,",
    "the interest in the field of fuzzy optimal control has increased and fuzzy optimal control problems have attracted a great deal of attention . a large number of existing schemes of fuzzy optimal control for nonlinear systems are proposed based on the framework of the takagi  sugeno ( t - s ) fuzzy model originated from fuzzy identification @xcite . moreover , for most of the t - s modelled nonlinear systems , fuzzy control design is carried out by the aid of the parallel distributed compensation ( pdc ) approach @xcite .",

    "the proposed method is not limited to just optimal fuzzy linear time - invariant controlled systems , which were previously studied in @xcite for integer - order problems . since the buckley and feuring concept of differentiability @xcite or even the hukuhara notion of differentiability are not able to guarantee that the obtained solutions are fuzzy functions , in the present work we focus on the generalized hukuhara differentiation .",
