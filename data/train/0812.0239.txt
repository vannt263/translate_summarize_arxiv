    "in the last few years , experiments on collective modes in ultracold trapped fermi gases at duke university @xcite and at innsbruck @xcite revealed a lot of interesting information about the different regimes which can be realized in these systems .",
    "this is mainly due to the possibility to change not only the temperature of the gas , but also the interaction between the atoms by adjusting the magnetic field in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance .",
    "one of the objectives of these experiments was to detect the transition from the normal to the superfluid phase .",
    "however , although the frequencies of the collective modes are generally different in the hydrodynamic and in the collisionless regime , it was recognized that a hydrodynamic behaviour of the gas is not an unambiguous sign of superfluidity .",
    "in fact , hydrodynamic behavior can be a consequence of superfluidity , but also of a sufficiently high collision rate in the normal - fluid phase @xcite .",
    "recently it was therefore proposed to distinguish the superfluid , the collisionally hydrodynamic , and the collisionless regime @xcite .",
    "the experimental results suggest that the transition from the superfluid to any of the normal - fluid regimes is always accompanied by a very strong damping of the collective modes .",
    "while the frequencies of the collective modes in the zero - temperature limit can easily be predicted in the framework of superfluid hydrodynamics , literature on the finite - temperature case is relatively sparse .",
    "one suggestion put forward by griffin et al . was to apply landau s two - fluid hydrodynamics @xcite , but this requires that the collision rate in the normal - fluid component is sufficiently high , i.e. , much higher than the mode frequency .",
    "this is usually not the case , since in a trapped system the collective modes have frequencies which are at least of the order of the trap frequency . in the opposite limit , i.e. ,",
    "if the normal - fluid component is collisionless , as it should be in the weakly interacting limit , a quasiparticle transport theory which couples superfluid hydrodynamics to a vlasov equation for the normal component was suggested by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "although this theory provides a qualitative explanation of the damping of the collective modes near the transition from the superfluid to the collisionless normal - fluid phase , it can not give a quantitative description of the recent experiments since these are generally done in the strongly interacting regime ( near a feshbach resonance ) .",
    "in the present paper , we will consider the case of attractive interaction , i.e. , negative scattering length @xmath1 , from the weakly interacting regime far from resonance up to the unitary limit , @xmath2 .",
    "we will concentrate on the normal - fluid phase , i.e. , on temperatures above the critical temperature @xmath3 of the superfluid - normal phase transition .",
    "the experimental data taken at these temperatures still show a rather strong damping of the collective modes , since the experiments are in fact neither in the collisionally hydrodynamic nor in the collisionless limit . this intermediate regime has been studied theoretically in the framework of the boltzmann equation (",
    "sometimes also called boltzmann - vlasov or landau - vlasov equation ) . in the framework of the boltzmann equation ,",
    "interactions between the atoms enter in two different places : on the one hand , each particle moves in a mean field characterizing the average of the interaction with all other particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the particles undergo two - body collisions , which are determined by the scattering cross - section .    in some of the early literature on this subject @xcite",
    ", the mean field effects were considered within the hartree approximation . however , the most recent work by bruun et al .",
    "@xcite concentrates mainly on the strongly interacting regime , where the hartree approximation breaks down : while more and more sophisticated models of the collision term were developed , mean field effects were completely neglected @xcite .",
    "therefore , the predicted frequencies in the collisionless limit are those of an ideal gas , and in the hydrodynamic limit , the equation of state is that of an ideal gas , too .",
    "however , at least the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite clearly shows the importance of the mean field shift in the collisionless regime .    the aim of the present paper is to include mean field like effects on the propagation of the particles into the boltzmann equation in a way which is appropriate also for the strongly interacting case .",
    "our approach is based on the in - medium scattering amplitude ( @xmath0 matrix ) , calculated in ladder approximation .",
    "this allows for a unified description of mean field like effects on the propagation of the particles ( self - energy ) and the modified cross - section entering the collision term of the boltzmann equation .",
    "we point out that in order to have a consistent theory , it is important to use in the description of the collective modes , which are small variations around equilibrium , the same self - energy as in the calculation of the equilibrium density profile .",
    "this can be seen , e.g. , by looking at the frequency of the sloshing mode , whose frequency , according to the kohn theorem @xcite , must be equal to the corresponding trap frequency .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : interaction ] , we concentrate on the description of the system in equilibrium . after illustrating the breakdown of the hartree approximation , we review the treatment of the interacting fermi gas in the framework of the ladder approximation , introducing the in - medium scattering amplitude , the single - particle self - energy , and the in - medium cross - section .",
    "we discuss the quasiparticle approximation which is necessary for describing the system in the framework of the boltzmann equation and which allows us to define a quantity similar to the mean field in hartree approximation .",
    "we show the resulting density profiles and discuss the limits of validity of the quasiparticle approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modes ] , we turn to the description of collective modes in the framework of the boltzmann equation , which now includes the `` mean field '' and the in - medium cross section . using the standard method of taking moments of the boltzmann equation in phase space , we obtain semi - analytic expressions for the collective mode frequencies which depend only on integrals of equilibrium quantities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : resu ] , we discuss our numerical results for the scissors , radial quadrupole , and breathing modes and compare them with the available experimental data for temperatures above @xmath3 . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we draw our conclusions and give an outlook to further developments .    throughout the paper , we will use in the derivations units with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 reduced planck constant , @xmath6 = boltzmann constant ) .",
    "let us consider a two - component ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) uniform fermi gas in the normal phase .",
    "as long as the range of the interaction is small compared with the mean distance between atoms , one can assume a zero - range ( @xmath9 function ) interaction between atoms of opposite spin , and the hamiltonian reads ( in second quantization ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the atom mass and the coupling constant and @xmath13 is the fermion field operator .",
    "we assume that the interaction is attractive , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "the coupling constant is related to the atom - atom scattering length @xmath15 via @xmath16 in hartree approximation , the single - particle energies of @xmath7 and @xmath8 particles are shifted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the exchange or fock term vanishes since the interaction is only between atoms with opposite spin . from now on",
    ", we will assume that both spin states are equally populated , and we denote by @xmath19 the density per spin state .",
    "then the hartree shift is the same for both spin states , and we may write @xmath20 let us now calculate the density as a function of the chemical potential @xmath21 . for our purposes it is enough to consider the zero - temperature limit , i.e. , temperatures @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are the fermi energy and fermi momentum , respectively .

    ".    if the above arguments were correct , a low - temperature fermi gas with attractive interaction should be unstable as soon as @xmath30 .",
    "however , we know from experiments that ultracold fermi gases are stable throughout the bcs - bec crossover , including the unitary limit @xmath31 , because the system prefers to form pairs instead of separating into two phases @xcite . the instability is simply an artefact of the hartree approximation and not physical .      in the hartree approximation",
    "as described in the previous subsection , the coupling constant @xmath12 was related to the scattering length @xmath15 in free space .",
    "this means that it was implicitly assumed that the scattering amplitude itself is the same in the gas as in free space . as we will see , this assumption is the origin of the unphysical instability of the hartree approximation at high density or strong interaction .",
    "for instance , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the scattering amplitude becomes proportional to @xmath32 instead of @xmath15 at high density .",
    "the approximation scheme we adopt here in order to calculate the in - medium scattering amplitude is based on the non self - consistent @xmath0 matrix approximation . in this approximation ,",

    "[ sec : hartree ] , the in - medium vertex function @xmath63 is now momentum and energy dependent .",
    "this complicates the calculation of the single - particle energy shift .",
    "even the concept of such an energy shift may be questioned if there are no well defined quasiparticles , as it is the case in the `` pseudogap regime '' @xcite . in any case , the appropriate object to calculate is the single - particle self - energy @xmath64 , which is well - defined and does not rely on the existence of quasiparticles .",

    "<S> due to pauli blocking of intermediate states , the scattering matrix ( or @xmath0 matrix ) of two fermionic atoms in a fermi gas becomes different from that of two atoms in free space . </S>",
    "<S> this effect becomes particularly important near a feshbach resonance , where the interaction in free space is very strong but becomes effectively suppressed in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the in - medium @xmath0 matrix in ladder approximation and study its effects on the properties of collective modes of a trapped gas in the normal - fluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the in - medium interaction on both sides of the boltzmann equation , namely in the calculation of the mean field and in the calculation of the collision rate . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to explain the observed upward shift of the frequency of the quadrupole mode in the collisionless regime . by including the mean field , </S>",
    "<S> we also improve considerably the agreement with the measured temperature dependence of frequency and damping rate of the scissors mode , whereas the use of the in - medium cross section deteriorates the description , in agreement with previous work . </S>"
