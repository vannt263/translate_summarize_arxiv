    "in the current age of precision cosmology , weak gravitational lensing is an important tool in understanding cluster mass morphology . because all gravitating mass ( baryonic or dark )",
    "influences the path of light rays on the same footing , gravitational lensing studies are the most direct measure of mass distribution within galaxies or galaxy clusters .",
    "current weak gravitational lensing studies relate the projected matter distribution to the observed gravitational shearing of images through an integral relation derived in @xcite and elsewhere .",
    "previous work by @xcite and others introduces a pde approach where the gravitational shearing is related first to the gravitational potential , from which the underlying matter distribution can be found .    a recent paper by @xcite introduced a new pde approach to weak gravitational lensing that directly relates the gravitational shear to the projected matter distribution . by examining the weak gravitational perturbations on a flat background space - time in the np spin coefficient formalism for a tetrad of constant null vectors",
    ", @xcite showed that one component of the bianchi identity provides a first - order , complex partial differential equation relating the gravitational shearing of images to the projected matter density . using a green s function ,",
    "the authors were able to show that their pde was equivalent to the integral equation derived by @xcite .",
    "this paper provides a more detailed derivation of the relevant pde to first order in gravitational potential and using a non - constant np null tetrad . to this order",
    ", we show that the other components of the bianchi identity ( that were not examined in @xcite ) yield no new information related to gravitational lensing .",
    "we show that a real poisson equation naturally arises from this complex , first - order pde that relates the gravitational shear to the projected matter density .",
    "the poisson equation derived here is related to the poisson equation of @xcite , but is derived from first principles of general relativity .",
    "we numerically integrate the poisson equation using relaxation methods for a matter distribution representing a truncated , isothermal sphere with a core radius .",
    "these numerical integrations are used to study the feasibility of the method for application to observational scenarios .",
    "in this section , we explain the physical arrangement of an observer , sources and matter distribution that leads to the null tetrad at the heart of the np formalism .",
    "we then specify ricci and weyl tensor components and non - zero spin coefficients and list the bianchi identities in the np formalism .",
    "we begin by considering an observer at the origin in a weakly perturbed , flat robertson - walker ( rw ) space - time .",
    "we assume that the perturbation is localized in some region far from the observer and that light sources lie beyond the perturbation , near the line of sight .",
    "we assume that these sources do not influence the space - time metric . for simplicity , we take the center of the matter distribution that perturbs the metric to lie at some distance along the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the space - time metric takes the form    @xmath1    where the perturbation @xmath2 depends on the proper distance in the background rw metric at the time light rays from the sources pass the lens on their way to the observer .",
    "the metric , eq .  [ m1 ] is conformal to the static metric    @xmath3    and the light rays of the two metrics are identical .    the np spin coefficient formalism is based on a tetrad of null vectors ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are complex spatial vectors spanning the cross section of a pencil of light rays and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are real null vectors . the tetrad vectors satisfy @xmath9 and @xmath10 with all other products equal to zero .",
    "the first null vector , @xmath7 , is chosen to be tangent to the past - directed null geodesics .    for our purposes",
    ", we will be considering null geodesics that connect our observer at the origin with sources lying beyond the lens near the @xmath0 axis .",
    "since we are pursuing weak gravitational lensing to first order in the gravitational potential , we will assume that the null geodesics connecting the observer and source are those of the background metric    @xmath11    variations in these null geodesics would be first order corrections in the gravitational potential . using the complex variable    @xmath12",
    "we can write the cartesian coordinate components of null tetrad vectors as    @xmath13    all of these vectors are null in the background metric , eq .  [ mb ] . when @xmath14 , the spatial part of @xmath7 is aligned with the @xmath0 axis . @xmath8 and @xmath5 are parallel propagated in the background metric along the @xmath7 congruence .",
    "geometrically , @xmath5 is a complex spatial vector perpendicular to the spatial part of @xmath7 that lies in the cross section of the light bundle surrounding @xmath7 .",
    "the ricci rotation coefficients are defined by    @xmath15    and in the np formalism , these are arranged into twelve complex np spin coefficients . in our examination of the bianchi identity",
    ", we will assume that @xmath16 is small so that the light rays lie close to the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the spin coefficients appear in the bianchi identity multiplied by a weyl or ricci tensor component which we compute to first order in the perturbation , @xmath2 .",
    "hence , we will keep only the zeroth order in @xmath16 contribution to the spin coefficients . in the appendix",
    ", we show that the only non - zero spin coefficients to this order are    @xmath17    where @xmath18 .",
    "the ricci and weyl tensors are decomposed into tetrad components by contracting the coordinate components with the tetrad vectors .",
    "we assume that the gravitational perturbation and @xmath16 are small , and discard terms of the form @xmath19 . in the appendix",

    ", we list the bianchi identity components that relate the ricci and weyl curvature tensor components , keeping only terms which are first order @xmath2 and discarding terms of order @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25    these equations are trivial identities if one uses the definitions of the ricci and weyl curvature tensor components from the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "[ ricci ] and [ weyl ] .",
    "our purpose is to examine these equations as field equations , where we assume that we know the weyl tensor components and wish to solve for the ricci tensor components . to this end",
    ", we will use the equivalences of the left hand sides of eqs .",
    "[ ricci ] and [ weyl ] .",
    "we note that this is the opposite of the program of newman and penrose , who studied gravitational radiation using these equations . there , vacuum space - time was studied so that the ricci tensor was zero , and the bianchi identities provided field equations to examine weyl tensor components at infinity , which represented gravitational radiation .",
    "in gravitational lensing , the three - dimensional matter density that leads to the deflection of light is projected into a two - dimensional surface matter density in the `` lens plane . ''",
    "the null geodesics connecting the observer and a source are replaced by two straight ( asymptotic ) rays that form a deflection angle at the lens plane .",
    "this leads to a lens equation mapping image locations in the lens plane into source positions in the source plane .",
    "the lens equation map depends on first derivatives ( in the lens plane ) of the projected gravitational potential .",
    "the jacobian of this mapping involves second derivatives of the projected gravitational potential .",
    "this jacobian can be used to map the shape of extended sources in the source plane into extended images in the lens plane , as is demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath26 as the projected gravitational potential ,    @xmath27    where the integral is taken from the observer position to the source position along the path connecting the source and observer .",
    "the projected gravitational potential depends only on the position the ray connecting the observer to the source strikes the lens plane ( whose coordinates are @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the goal of weak gravitational lensing is to determine the projected matter density , @xmath30 , from observed weak gravitational `` shears : '' @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these three quantities arise in the jacobian of the lens mapping and are defined as    @xmath33    ( note that this matter density @xmath30 is unrelated to the spin - coefficient @xmath30 of eq .",

    "this integral equation is the basis for observational weak gravitational lensing .",
    "the connection of our np formalism to gravitational lensing is accomplished by projecting each of our bianchi identities and the relevant curvature components along the paths connecting the observer and source .",
    "while the bianchi identity relates curvature components at each point along the light ray connecting the source and observer , the projection represents an accumulation similar to that studied in gravitational lensing .",
    "we begin by projecting the @xmath38 and @xmath39 curvature components . since we are interested in weak lensing ( where the deflection is minimal ) , we project by integrating along the spatial part of the past light rays given by @xmath7 in the tetrad , eq .",
    "since we want to work to lowest order in the potential , this is equivalent to integrating along the @xmath40 axis from the observer to the source . using a pre - script `` l '' to denote a quantity projected into the lens plane , we define    @xmath41    where we use eq .",

    "the remaining ricci tensor components project as    @xmath48    likewise , @xmath49 , but the projections of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are both zero because both involve a @xmath40 derivative and we assume @xmath52 and @xmath53 are zero far from the lens .",

    "[ ricci ] and [ weyl ] , our interest is in forming field equations for the components of the ricci tensor ( or matter density ) given the weyl tensor ( or gravitational shear ) as a source under the conditions of gravitational lensing .",

    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 directional derivatives lie in the lens plane ( to zeroth order in @xmath16 ) and the integration can be passed through the derivative .",
    "this implies , for example , that the projection of @xmath59 will be zero since the projection of @xmath50 is zero .",
    "when the projection is applied to quantities on which the @xmath60 and @xmath61 derivative operators act , one has    @xmath62    where we will assume that all the curvature tensors are approximately zero far from the lens .    for four of the bianchi identities ,",
    "[ a4b ] , [ a4c ] , [ a4f ] , and [ a4 g ] , the entire left hand side of the bianchi identity `` vanishes '' under projection .",
    "this means that these equations have no content as field equations for projected ricci or weyl tensor components .",
    "the equality of the identity under the projection holds exactly because the small boundary value terms that we choose to neglect cancel the small projected term on the right hand side of the equation .    using eqs .",

    "@xmath66 far from the lens , the combination @xmath67 is non - zero but finite and small at the observer s location .",
    "in addition , because the physical gravitational potential will only be substantially different from zero near the lens , the combination @xmath68 is a nearly odd function in @xmath69 due to the @xmath40 derivative in the definition of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the projection of @xmath67 is very small compared with individual terms on the left hand side of eqs .",

    "however , we choose to constrain the grid spacing based on approximate number counts of objects in the background of a lens that are resolved by the telescope in question .",
    "observational weak gravitational lensing is an inherently statistical study since the natural shape of unlensed background objects is not known and only assumed to be _ on average _ circular . for the purposes of this paper , we assume that there are not intrinsic background galaxy alignments .    far from the center of a matter distribution , the gravitational lensing shear signal is weak , and a relatively large number of objects is required to form a good estimate of the underlying shear .",
    "closer to the center of the distribution , a smaller number of objects is needed because the shear is substantially larger .",
    "generally , 30 - 40 objects far from the center of the matter distribution and 10 objects in the central region are sufficient for a reasonable statistical weak lensing analysis .",

    "[ wide : fig ] . setting the added boundary values to the ( in principle unknown ) correct values results in extremely accurate numerical integration at this number of boxes , as one would expect .    therefore , we see that the overall limitation is the requirement of large boxes . for the scenario we have described , using @xmath117 boxes results in only @xmath118 objects per box .",

    "[ poisson3 ] by relaxation with large boxes will be good enough to detect weak lensing and get a sense of the overall mass , but will be insufficient for detailed mass maps .",
    "we also see that the mass sheet degeneracy is not a major issue for wide field images .",
    "setting the edges to zero ( as opposed to the unknown correct values ) does not significantly effect the results .",

    "the scaled error curves have similar , but more gentle slopes to those of the wide - field telescopes .",
    "the total relative error in the mass is @xmath126 .",
    "this modeling is unphysical because one can never know the true mass density to assign at the boundary of the hst image .",
    "however , if one had both a ground - based , wide field image and an hst image of the same cluster , then one could use the wide - field image to give interpolated values for the boundary of the hst image .    to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach",

    "we assume that the centers of these two images are the same and that there is no rotation between the images . after relaxing the wide field image using @xmath107 boxes as before",
    ", we use the numerically obtained values of @xmath30 from the large grid to find values for the boundary of the hst image by interpolation .",
    "we then relax the small grid with these interpolated boundary values .    the relative error in the @xmath30 boundary values is shown in fig .  [ border : fig ] along one line of the boundary of the small field of view grid .",
    "the points at large @xmath28 correspond to the corners of the grid , and by design , the errors are symmetrical along each of the four edges of the small grid .",
    "we see that the approximate boundary values have a moderate relative error , where the relaxed values from the large grid slightly underestimate the true values near the corners of the grid by about @xmath127 and substantially overestimate the values near the center of the grid by about @xmath128 .    even though the relative errors in the small grid boundary values are moderate , the actual errors are small compared to assigning zero on the boundary of the small grid .",
    "this results in successful relaxation of the small grid in reproducing the mass density .",
    "the error in the central bin is less than @xmath129 and the total relative error in the predicted mass on the small grid is @xmath130 .",
    "( the relaxed total mass is more than the actual value . )    figure  [ 2grid : fig ] shows the scaled errors along the @xmath28 axis and diagonal as before .",
    "these scaled errors clearly track the error in the boundary conditions found by interpolation , as one would expect .",
    "nevertheless , the errors are all acceptably small so that one can use the ground based image to provide boundary values and the space based image to provide accurate mapping of the mass density .",

    "it is well known that the optical scalars , @xmath65 and @xmath131 , which control the divergence and shearing of the pencil of rays connecting an extended source to the observer through the optical scalar equation , are related to the components of the ricci and weyl tensors through the sach s equation .",

    "the advance of this paper is to explicitly derive a relation between the mass density ( represented by the ricci tensor component @xmath46 ) and the gravitational shears ( represented by the weyl tensor component @xmath47 ) .",
    "this connection is the meaningful observational relationship , but the fact that it comes directly from the bianchi identity , rather than a manipulation of the optical scalar equations or the sach s equation , would have to be viewed as a happy accident .",
    "the poisson equation derived here is related to the poisson equation reported in @xcite , which is derived kinematically by considering the relationships between @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and the underlying projected gravitational potential .",
    "when the terms that are not linear in the gravitational potential are removed from the poisson equation in @xcite , one obtains the poisson equation reported here . removing the non - linear terms is consistent with the linearized metric used here .",
    "we examined reasonable observational scenarios in this paper and found that for a wide - field image alone , it would at least be difficult to use eq .",

    ", we studied only relaxation methods , which require that the data be binned to achieve an acceptable average shear .",
    "it is possible that the more complicated to implement method of maximum likelihood , which can use individual data points , would result in an accurate mass map .",
    "we were able to show that the combination of a ground - based , wide - field image and an hst image could be used to determine an accurate mass map in the central hst region .",
    "the fact that good results were achieved using relaxation methods indicates that the numerical integration of eq .",
    "[ poisson3 ] is a promising road for weak lensing mass maps . when using a wide - field image , we examined the mass sheet degeneracy and found that knowing the correct boundary values did not significantly improve the accuracy of the mass maps",
    ".    our paper did not consider several important sources of error .",
    "first , we did not add noise to the shear measurements , which would more accurately reflect the observational situation .",
    "the presence of small noise would make the errors in the two grid method larger , but we believe that our large box size ( large enough to accommodate roughly 20 objects per box ) , would minimize this error .",
    "second , we did not model missing data in our analysis .",
    "bright nearby stars lead to saturation in regions on the ccd image , obscuring sometimes large regions and generally reducing the ability to extract background objects nearby .",
    "this would both add to the noise in the average boxed shear values and typically cause a handful of boxes to have no measured data .",
    "one could model these missing data points using surrounding data points if this was the case .",
    "overall , we expect that these two sources of error would lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of the numerical integration , but would not cause the numerical integration to fail .",
    "two minor issues not examined here related to the ground and hst images are not expected influence the results of our study .",
    "first , the two images are unlikely to be exactly centered .",
    "second , there is typically a rotation between the two images . using common stars or bright objects",
    ", one can easily orient the two coordinate systems .",
    "it is then simply a matter of interpolating from the large grid onto the small grid boundary .",
    "since ground based images are so much larger than hst images , the center offset would have a minimal impact .",
    "a rotation would cause the relative error of fig .",
    "[ 2grid : fig ] to vary in position , but the overall effectiveness should be maintained .",
    "this paper gives a rigorous derivation of a poisson equation , eq .",
    "[ poisson3 ] , that directly relates the mass density to derivatives of the weak lensing shears .",
    "we show that no new information is obtained by examining the remaining components of the bianchi identity , so that the full theory of weak gravitational lensing and image distortion is most completely described by the optical scalar equations discussed in @xcite .    using the simplest possible integration scheme ,",
    "we show that the poisson equation can be used to detect weak lensing signals , but fails to give accurate mass maps for wide - field , ground based images .",
    "however , simple relaxation methods were shown to be successful when a ground and hst image were both present .",
    "this method of determining the matter distribution could prove very useful in developing highly accurate mass maps .",
    "further examination of the poisson equation is warranted .",
    "specifically , it would be interesting to know whether maximum likelihood methods could yield accurate mass maps for ground based images alone . also , the application of the two grid method to mock background images that include appropriate levels of noise would solidify the usefulness of the method .",
