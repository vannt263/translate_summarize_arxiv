    "in classical morphological sequence by @xcite lenticular galaxies occupy intermediate position between ellipticals and spirals : they have a smooth and red appearance as the ellipticals , but also have stellar disks , almost as large as those of the spirals .",
    "the most popular hypothesis of s0 origin is that of their transformation from the spirals by stopping global star formation and removing or consuming remaining gas @xcite . in distant , @xmath6 , clusters this transformation",
    "is now observed directly : the number of lenticulars in the clusters diminishes strongly with the redshift @xcite , instead one can see ` passive spirals '  red spiral galaxies lacking star formation  at the periphery ( ` infalling regions ' ) of the intermediate - redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "many theoretical works have been done to explain in detail what physical mechanisms may be involved into the process of spiral transformation into the lenticulars : tidally induced collisions of disk gas clouds @xcite , harassment @xcite , ram pressure by intercluster medium @xcite , etc . for the s0s in the field ,",
    "the scheme of their transformation from the spirals is not so clear , but common view is that some external action like minor merger may produce the necessary effect .    by reviewing the various mechanisms of secular evolution which may transform a spiral galaxy into a lenticular one we have noticed that most of them result in gas concentration in the very center of the galaxy , so that a nuclear star formation burst seems inavoidable circumstance of the s0 galaxy birth .",
    "if to refer to s0 statistics in the clusters located between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the main epoch of s0 formation is @xmath9 , so the nuclear star formation bursts in the nearby s0s must not be older than 5 gyr .",
    "indeed , in my spectral study of the central parts of nearby galaxies in different types of environments @xcite i have found that @xmath10 of nearby lenticulars have strong absorption lines h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 in their nuclear spectra so they are of ` e+a ' type , as it is presently called and are dominated by intermediate - age stellar population . in this respect",
    "the s0s have resembled rather early - type spirals than ellipticals . here",
    "i aim to continue this study , with a larger sample and with panoramic spectral data in order to separate the nuclei and their outskirts ( bulges ) which is a substantial advantage with respect to aperture spectroscopy .",
    "another crucial point of the present study , and also of a global paradigm of galaxy formation , is environmental influence .",
    "the current hierarchical assembly paradigm predicts a younger age of galaxies in lower density environments  for the most recent simulations see e.g. @xcite or @xcite .",
    "observational evidences concerning early - type galaxies are controversial : some authors find differences of stellar population ages between the clusters and the field @xcite , some authors do not find any dependence of the stellar population age on environment density @xcite . in order to check whether the mean ages of the stellar populations depend on environment density monotonously , as the hierarchical paradigm predicts , in this work i consider four types of environments separately : the cluster galaxies , the brightest ( central ) galaxies of groups , the second - ranked group members , and the field galaxies .",
    "the sample of lenticular galaxies considered in this work consists of 58 objects , mostly nearby and bright . it does not pretend to be complete but rather representative . in the leda",
    "we have found 122 galaxies in total with the following parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath14 km / s , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , without bright agn or intense present star formation in a nucleus ; among them 40 virgo members . for our sample , from this list we have selected 8 virgo members and 42 other galaxies  half of the rest .",
    "a few galaxies are added to broaden the luminosity range : ngc 5574 , ngc 3065 , and ngc 7280 are fainter than @xmath17 , ngc 80 and ngc 2911 are very luminous but farther from us than 40 mpc .",

    "some galaxies have measurements only for the nuclei or only for the bulges due to various reasons  for example , in ngc  5866 the nucleus is completely obscured by dust and in ngc  676 the bulge measurements are severely contaminated by a bright star projected at @xmath103 from the nucleus . for the indices presented here , there are models based on evolutionary synthesis of simple ( one - age , one - metallicity ) stellar populations ",
    "see e.g. @xcite . these models allow to estimate the luminosity - weighted mean metallicities and the ages of the stellar populations by confronting the hydrogen - line index h@xmath0 to any metal - line index .",
    "we are also going to consider the duration of the last major star - forming episode by confronting @xmath1 to mgb .",
    "chemical evolution models , see e.g. @xcite , show that because of the difference in the timescales of iron and magnesium production by a stellar generation , the solar mg / fe abundance ratio can be obtained only by very continuous star formation , and brief star formation bursts , with @xmath104 gyr , would give significant magnesium overabundance , up to @xmath105}=+0.3 - + 0.4 $ ] . in this work we use recent models by @xcite because these models are calculated for several values of [ mg / fe ] : they allow to estimate mg / fe ratios of the stellar populations from mgb and @xmath102 measurements .",
    "figure  2 presents the @xmath1 * vs * mgb diagrams for the bulges and fig .  3  the similar diagrams for the nuclei , for all four types of environments . for some galaxies ( e.g. ngc 2655 and ngc 2911 ) where the @xmath325199 emission is significant ,",
    "the mgb indices are corrected from this emission line according to the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the model sequences for @xmath105}=0.0,\\ , + 0.3,\\,$ ] and @xmath106 are well separated on the diagrams @xmath1 * vs * mgb , so we can estimate the mean mg / fe ratios ` by eye ' .",
    "surprisingly , the bulges of the group central galaxies differ from those of the second - ranked group members : the former have the mean @xmath105}\\approx + 0.2 $ ] , and the latter  @xmath107 . as by the definition the second - rank group galaxies are less luminous than the central ones ,",
    "this difference may be attributed not to the environment density , but to the galaxy mass effect , at the first glance . to check this , in fig .",
    "4 we have plotted the bulges only for the galaxies within the narrow stellar velocity dispersion range , @xmath108 km / s  in this @xmath109 range the central and second - rank group members of our sample have the same _ mean _ @xmath109 of 172 km / s ; still the difference between the central group galaxies and the second - rank members persists in fig .",
    "this tendency of the s0s in the centers of groups to resemble more the cluster lenticulars , and of the second - rank group members and the paired galaxies to be like the field s0s , is in general confirmed by the nuclei distribution in the @xmath1 * vs * mgb diagrams ( fig .",
    "3 ) , though there are more ` outliers ' among the nuclei : evidently , the evolution of nuclear stellar populations bears more individual features than that of the bulges .    to break the age - metallicity degeneracy and to determine simultaneously the mean luminosity - weighted ages and the metallicities of the stellar populations , we confront the h@xmath0 indices to the combined metal - line index [ mgfe]@xmath110  by plotting our data together with the models of @xcite ; earlier we have assured that this diagram is insensitive to the mg / fe ratio .",
    "however we have one serious problem here : the absorption - line index h@xmath0 may be contaminated by emission , especially in the nuclear spectra . to correct from the emission the h@xmath0 indices which we have measured we have used data on equivalent widths of h@xmath33 emission lines because h@xmath33 emission lines are always much stronger than h@xmath0 emission lines and because an h@xmath33 absorption line is not deeper than an h@xmath0 absorption line in spectra of stellar populations of any age while in intermediate - age population spectra it is much shallower .",
    "the emission - line intensity ratio , @xmath111 , has been studied well both empirically and theoretically .",
    "the minimum value of this ratio , 2.5 , is known for the case of radiative excitation by young stars @xcite . for other types of excitation",
    "this ratio is higher .",
    "we have no pure -type nuclei in our sample , so here we use the formula @xmath112 : this mean relation is obtained by @xcite for a quite heterogeneous sample of nearby emission - line galaxies . the data on @xmath113 for the nuclei we take mainly from @xcite .",
    "the bulge h@xmath0 indices were corrected from the emission by using h@xmath33 equivalent widths obtained with the red mpfs spectra for about a half of the sample ( 28 objects , see the table  [ sample ] ) .",
    "unlike @xcite who obtained @xmath114 by subtracting a pure absorption - line template from the observed spectra , we applied a multicomponent gauss - analysis to the combinations of the @xmath115 absorption and emission lines which was effective due to mostly different velocity dispersions of stars and gas clouds in the galaxies under consideration . from the rest , 16 galaxies have negligible emission lines in the bulge spectra ( @xmath116 } ) \\le 0.3$] , see the table  [ bulges ] ) , and for the others the age estimates obtained by using the h@xmath0 indices corrected through the h@xmath33 ( table  [ bulges ] ) are indeed only upper limits . to correct in some way all the bulge spectra , we have used also the wide - known approach which involves the [ ] @xmath325007 emission line ; @xcite recommend to use the statistical correction @xmath117}\\lambda 5007)$ ] though they note that individual ratios h@xmath0/ [ ] may vary between 0.33 and 1.25 within their sample of elliptical galaxies . in fig .",
    "5 we compare the corrections obtained by two different ways for the nuclei .",
    "if we exclude two galaxies with extremely strong emission in the centers ",
    "ngc 4138 and ngc 7743  statistically the two types of the corrections are indistinguishable ; however the accuracy of [ ] measuring is not very high due to strong underlying absorption lines of , and the weak emission lines [ ] with the equivalent widths of @xmath118  are evidently artifacts . to summarize this analysis ,",
    "we conclude that while for mutual comparisons of the age distributions we must take only the age estimates corrected through the [ ] because this correction can be made for all galaxies of the sample , for the individual galaxies having the red spectra the estimates made with the h@xmath0 indices corrected through the h@xmath33 are more reliable due to the facts that the h@xmath33 emission is stronger and that the ratio of the balmer emission lines depends only on the excitation mechanism unlike the ratio of h@xmath0 to [ ] which depends also on the metallicity of the gas .",
    "figure  6 presents the diagrams h@xmath0 * vs * [ mgfe ] for the nuclei ( top ) and for the bulges ( bottom ) of the galaxies of all types of environments with their h@xmath0 indices corrected through the h@xmath33 to the left and with their h@xmath0 indices corrected through the [ ] to the right , correspondingly . by inspecting these diagrams ,",
    "we determine the ages and the metallicities ` by eye ' that provides an accuracy of @xmath119 dex in metallicity and 1  gyr for the ages less than 8  gyr and @xmath120 gyr for older stellar systems which match our accuracy of the lick indices . directly in the diagrams one can see that the range of the ages of the nuclei is very wide : they may be as young as 1 gyr old and as old as 15 gyr old .",
    "the bulges are on average older than the nuclei , and in the bottom plots one can see a segregation of the galaxies according to their type of environment : most the bulges of the group centers and the cluster galaxies are older than 5 gyr , whereas some of the group members and the field lenticulars have the bulges as young as 2 - 3 gyr old .",
    "the metallicity ranges seem to be similar for the bulges in all types of environments : their [ z / h ] are confined between @xmath121 and @xmath122 . by fitting formally the metallicity distributions by gaussians , we obtain the mean metallicity for the bulges in dense environments to be 0.04 and that for the bulges in sparse environments to be 0.13 , with the similar rms of 0.5 dex .",
    "the nuclei seem to be on average more metal - rich : only three nuclei in the galaxies of sparse environments have the metallicity less than the solar .",
    "@xcite have already reported the difference between the stellar population characteristics of the early - type galaxies in the dense and sparse environments .",
    "their measurements were aperture spectroscopy , and their samples were the fornax cluster as an example of dense environments and galaxies without more than 2 neighbors within the search radius of 1.3 mpc as an example of sparse environments  the latter sample is probably close to our combination of the field plus paired galaxies .",
    "they have found that the e / s0 galaxies in sparse environments are younger than the e / s0 galaxies in the cluster by 2 - 3 gyr  and our result for the s0s is quite the same .",
    "but they have also found the anti - correlation between the age and metallicity , the younger galaxies in sparse environments being on average more metal - rich ( by 0.2 dex ) than the older galaxies in the cluster ; while if we see any metallicity difference , it should be in opposite sense .    in fig .",
    "7 we plot cumulative distributions of the ages : the number of galaxies not older than @xmath123 * versus * @xmath124 ( in gyr ) .",
    "we have united the samples of the brightest group s0s and the cluster galaxies into a ` dense environment ' sample , and the group second - ranked members and the field s0s  into a ` sparse environment ' sample .",
    "the effect of environments is seen both for the nuclei and for the bulges : in sparse environments the stellar populations are , on average , younger .",
    "the estimates of the median ages are the following : 3.7 and 6 gyr for the nuclei of the galaxies in sparse and dense environments , correspondingly , and 4.8 and 8.3 gyr for the bulges .",
    "it is a little bit surprising that according to my results , the ` dense ' type of environment must be ascribed not only to the clusters but also to the centers of groups : the first - ranked and the second - ranked s0 galaxies of the groups have very different properties of their central stellar population .",
    "however , this conclusion is close to the recent finding by @xcite that the early - type galaxies of hickson compact groups resemble more the cluster galaxies than the field ones .",
    "i think it gives us a hint that the dynamical effect of close neighbors may play the main role in evolution rate , and not the mass of the common dark halo .",

    "i have plotted the bulge age estimates versus the central stellar velocity dispersion in fig .",
    "8 . indeed , the correlation is present implying that the more massive bulges are older ; the slope of the regression @xmath124 * vs * @xmath133 is @xmath134 for the dense environments and @xmath135 for the sparse ones with the correlation coefficients of 0.53 and 0.55 , correspondingly .",
    "following @xcite , we have calculated the mean ages of the bulges within narrow ranges of stellar velocity dispersion ( when the age estimate has only the low limit of 15 gyr , i have ascribed the value of 16 gyr to it ) .",
    "these estimates are given in table  [ agevss ]  please compare them with those in @xcite , 7.4 gyr , rms 4.2 gyr , in the range of @xmath136 km / s , and 9.9 gyr , rms 4.2 gyr , in the range of @xmath137 km / s .",
    "one can see from table  [ agevss ] that the ages of the bulges are the same in different types of environments for the lower bins of @xmath109 , 105145 and 145 - 185 km / s ; but in the highest bin , 185225 km / s , the ages are dramatically different , the massive bulges in dense environments being much older than the massive bulges in sparse environments . by inspecting fig .",
    "8 , we notice that the separation between the bulges in different types of environments starts from about @xmath138 km / s . taking 7 galaxies in dense environments and 7 galaxies in sparse environments with the @xmath109 in the range of 170215 km / s ,",
    "we obtain @xmath139 gyr , rms 3.2 gyr , for the former and @xmath140 gyr , rms 3.7 gyr , for the latter subsample ; so the difference is @xmath141 gyr .",
    "the application of the student t - statistics to this double subsample of the massive bulges shows that the mean age of the massive bulges in dense environments is larger than the mean age of the massive bulges in sparse environments with the probability higher than 0.85 ( the hypothesis of @xmath142 is rejected at the significance level of 0.14 ) .",
    "by considering the stellar population properties in the nuclei and the bulges of the nearby lenticular galaxies in the various types of environments , i have found certain differences between the nuclei and the bulges as well as between the galaxies in dense and sparse environments .",
    "the nuclei are on average younger than the bulges in any types of environments , and both the nuclei and the bulges of s0s in sparse environments are younger than those in dense environments .",
    "the results of the consideration of the mg / fe ratios suggest that the main star formation epoch may be more brief in the centers of the galaxies in dense environments .",
