    "rs  ophiuchi is the most active and best studied member of the small recurrent nova class of interacting binary star .",
    "it consists of a red giant ( rg ) donating material to a white dwarf ( wd ) primary , via either roche lobe overflow or direct wind accretion .",
    "six optical outbursts have been observed at irregular intervals ( 1898 , 1933 , 1958 , 1967 , 1985 and 2006 ) with two others suggested in the literature ( 1907 ; 1945 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "the optical development is very similar in each case @xcite .",
    "the 1985 outburst was the first in which observations were made at radio wavelengths , with first detection 18  days after outburst @xcite .",
    "spectral development showed both non - thermal synchrotron and thermal free - free emission , varying over the course of the rise to peak by about day  40 and subsequent decline over 240  days @xcite .",
    "a single vlbi image was obtained , showing possible three  component emission extended east ",
    "west around the radio peak @xcite .",
    "the latest outburst by this object was discovered on 2006  february  12 , and reached a peak of v=4.5 on 2006  february  12.83 @xcite , which we take as day  0 for the rest of this paper .",
    "we began radio observations on day  4 , first with merlin at 6  ghz and then with the vla at 1.49 , 4.89 , 14.96 and 22.48  ghz ( l , c , u and k bands respectively ) , as described in this paper .",
    "in addition vlbi observations began on day  13 and continued throughout the period of the observations discussed here .",
    "both the vlbi @xcite and x - ray @xcite observations are consistent with an expanding shock wave due to the fast ejecta from the eruption on the wd encountering the pre ",
    "outburst rg wind .",
    "hst observations on day  155 @xcite gave added weight to the suggestion of a bipolar remnant from vlbi observations by @xcite . here",
    "we interpret the first and second radio peaks with reference to the vlbi , hst and x - ray observations",
    "the multi - element radio - linked interferometer - network ( merlin ) responded rapidly to the triggering of target - of - opportunity observations , with the first observations starting at day  4.3 .",
    "monitoring continued at times complementary to vla , the european vlbi network ( evn ) and the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , with observation dates as shown in table  [ tab - obs ] .",
    "observations were made initially at 5  cm and later at 6  cm ( collectively referred to as c  band ) .",
    "full imaging runs were made , at around 10  hours each including calibration observations .",
    "the flux calibrator in each case was 3c286 , with oq208 used for point source response and polarisation calibration .",
    "phase calibration was performed with regular pointings at j1743@xmath3038 . using standard values and models for the flux calibrator , the flux scale for the phase calibrator was determined .",
    "the phase calibrator solutions were then interpolated to the rs  oph data . for the observations on days  4 and 5 , the flux density was rising so rapidly that the data were divided into 30min segments and we were able to follow the rapid rise .",
    "a similar analysis on day  7 showed that the rate of decline had flattened by that date .",
    "the very large array ( vla ) in new mexico also responded rapidly to the request for observations , with the first made on 2006  february  17 ( day  4.7 ) , almost simultaneous with the first merlin observations , and continuing approximately weekly thereafter .",
    "observation dates are given in table  [ tab - obs ] , and on each occasion continuum observations were made at 1.46  ghz ( l  band ) , 4.89  ghz ( c  band ) , 14.96  ghz ( u  band ) and 22.48  ghz ( k  band ) with a 50  mhz bandwidth .",
    "observations were made in standard interferometer mode at a  array ( the most extended and high  resolution configuration ) , with 1743@xmath3038 ( j2000 ) as secondary calibrator .",
    "either 3c286 or 3c48 was used as the primary calibrator , depending upon which was available within the scheduled observing window .",
    "fluxes were calculated for the primary calibrators using the approach outlined in @xcite but employing the latest ( 1999.2 ) vla coefficients .",
    "the phase and amplitude solutions were determined using model images supplied within aips .",
    "the secondary calibrator solutions were determined assuming it to be a point source , and the flux at observation from these solutions and the calculated flux of the primary calibrator .",
    "finally the flux scale for rs  oph was determined from the secondary calibrator solutions .",
    "images were generated using the clean algorithm and aips task imagr at each band on each date and used to determine flux densities . at 22.48",
    "ghz it was also feasible to estimate the extent of the emission as these were the data with the highest spatial resolution .",
    "30-ghz continuum observations were made using the toru 32-m radio telescope and a prototype ( two - element receiver ) of the one - centimeter radio array ( ocra - p , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the recorded output from the instrument was the difference between signals from two closely - spaced horns effectively separated in azimuth by 3.1 arcminutes so the atmospheric and gain fluctuations were mostly cancelled out .",
    "the observing technique was such that the respective two beams were pointed at the source alternately with a switching cycle of @xmath450  s for a period of @xmath45.5  min , thus measuring the source flux density relative to the sky background on either side of the source .",
    "the primary flux calibrator was the planetary nebula ngc  7027 , which has an effective radio angular size of 8  arcsec @xcite . assuming a spectral index of @xmath5 and using an absolute temperature calibration of ngc  7027 ( giving 5.45@xmath00.20  jy at 32  ghz , from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we estimate the flux density of ngc  7027 at 30  ghz as 5.46@xmath00.20  jy .",
    "all the final flux density values have been scaled to this figure .",
    "the telescope pointing was determined from the azimuth and elevation scans across the nearby point source j1743@xmath3038 .",
    "the same source was also used as a secondary flux density calibrator because ngc  7027 was at some distance from the target source .",
    "corrections for the effects of the atmosphere were determined from the system temperature measurements at zenith distances of 0@xmath6 and 60@xmath6 .",
    "observations were made at 1.667  ghz with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) on day  63 ( 2007  april  17 ) ",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator , array operations center , new mexico before being transferred to jodrell bank observatory , united kingdom and joint institute for vlbi in europe in dwingeloo , netherlands for calibration and mapping .",
    "primary flux calibration was carried out using 3c286 , with secondary calibration on j1745 - 0753 . as the resolution at this epoch was around 20",
    "mas it was necessary to model the structure of both calibrators to obtain reliable flux and phase calibration .",
    "fringe fitting was carried out to complete calibration and allow imaging of the emission structure .",
    "the flux density values from each date at each observed frequency are given in table  [ tab - obs ] .",
    "in addition effelsberg measured 36 mjy at 10.45 ghz on day  5.5 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) values below 1.4  ghz .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in all cases",
    "the beam is elongated , with the major axis being between 50% and 70% longer than the minor axis .",
    "some care must be applied when interpreting deconvolved extents .",
    "where there are @xmath40@xmath6  or @xmath4180@xmath6  between the two position angle ( pa ) values ( extent and beam ) then the deconvolution is highly uncertain as we are attempting to resolve in the direction of worst resolution .",
    "this problem affects the deconvolution for days  4 and 13 , where the difference between the pa values is @xmath4175@xmath6  and @xmath414@xmath6  respectively , and we do not include these points in our subsequent discussion . in all but two of the other cases the deconvolved pa@xmath490@xmath6 , consistent with imaging results from the vlti , evn , merlin , vlba and hst @xcite .",
    "the image formed from vlba data at 1.667  ghz on day  63 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - vlba ] ) shows multiple components extended east  west .",
    "the inner components are in the same place and of the same size as the emission seen at 22.48  ghz with the vla on day  59 ( table  [ tab - kband ] ) .",
    "components extended east - west were seen in earlier vlba , evn and merlin data @xcite so it is reasonable to assume these are related to the more extended outer components seen here at day 63 and hence would have also been present just four days earlier at the time of the vla imaging .",
    "we have attempted to estimate the spectral index of these components .",
    "the eastern and brightest western components each have flux densities in fig .  [ fig - vlba ] of @xmath43.6  mjy .",
    "however this image is heavily tapered , and these are really lower limits on the flux density . comparing this with a 1@xmath7 upper limit for these regions in the vla 22  ghz data of day  59 , we find @xmath8 , wholly consistent with these features being non  thermal",
    ". if the actual flux density of the extended components is greater at l  band , this value will be still more negative .",
    "in 1985 observations starting on day  18 were extrapolated back to an assumed `` turn - on '' of the emission on about day  14 @xcite .",
    "it is evident that the first peak seen in 2006 was before any observations in 1985 .",
    "however we note that the 2006 flux density on days  16 and 17 at 6  ghz ( table  [ tab - obs ] ) is significantly higher than seen on day  18 in 1985 .",
    "this implies either a fairly rapid drop of @xmath412  mjy and recovery of @xmath420  mjy in @xmath43  days , or that the initial peak was completed more rapidly in 1985 ( if present at all ) .",
    "in addition it is notable that emission at lower frequencies was not seen in 1985 , but is evident after day  20 in 2006 @xcite .",
    "it is not immediately clear what the cause of this early rise is , but one possibility is that we are seeing emission from the reverse shock traversing the ejecta at early times .",
    "however , below we suggest a two  component model for the emitting regions .",
    "a number of supernovae have shown variations in radio emission , generally attributed to the ejecta interacting with density variations in the surrounding medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may be a contributing factor in rs  ophiuchi , where the density variations may be in the wind from the red giant , although the incomplete sampling of the radio light curve makes it difficult to test this idea .",
    "our multi ",
    "band observations show that the sed varies over timescales of a few days .",
    "the initial rapid rise at 1.46  ghz and 4.89  ghz is consistent with the emergence of an expanding source from the densest inner parts of an enveloping absorbing medium .",
    "this we identify with the red giant wind ionised by the nova eruption , and providing a source of free - free absorption .",
    "the rise between days  4 and 13 is at least 6  mjy  day@xmath9 , although as it is possible that the 5  ghz flux density had peaked earlier this is a lower limit . by day  13",
    "we are seeing a mixed optically thin and thick thermal spectrum , and it is striking that this is similar to the sed on days  38 to 46 .",
    "both these periods are at , or shortly after , a radio peak , suggesting similar emission details at these epochs . around day  21 , the brightness minimum between the two peaks , the spectrum declines with frequency across the band , indicating that the optically thin thermal emission dominates at this time .",
    "note also that @xcite have demonstrated a non - thermal emission component dominates below 1.4  ghz from day  20 .",
    "thus while a thermal spectrum dominates at high  frequencies , a non  thermal spectrum dominates at low frequencies .",
    "consequently in most of the bands observed with the vla a combined spectrum is seen .",
    "we note that the best fitting supernova  style model ( fading non  thermal emission subject to variable absorption ) of @xcite also fits our early l  band data ( up to and including day 21 ) .",
    "however it does not fit the higher frequency data at these early times , predicting much brighter c  band emission that turns on at earlier times than is observed .",
    "furthermore , it clearly can not fit the subsequent ( second ) peak seen in our l  band and higher frequencies .",
    "the data suggest at least two emitting components subject to differing absorption and likely to be a mix of thermal and non - thermal emission .",
    "the complexity of the geometry and emission details precludes a detailed fit to the full dataset at this stage",
    ".      the spectral development can be further constrained by examining the morphological development of the ejecta at different wavelengths .",
    "day  13 coincides with a simple , if one  sided , emission shell ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vlbi images ) .",
    "day  21 sees the emergence of an eastern component that also experiences absorption such that it appears at 5  ghz before 1.46  ghz @xcite .",
    "the expansion apparent from the 22  ghz images ( table  [ tab - kband ] ) is consistent with a power law of the form angular size @xmath10  mas , where time @xmath11 in days has its origin on day  0 .",
    "although we discard the size measurement for day  13 at 22  ghz ( section  [ ssec - kband ] ) , this expansion rate is consistent with the size of the partial shell structure seen by @xcite on that day .",
    "if expansion proceeded at a constant rate at later times , this also agrees with the e - w extent of the remnant imaged by the hst on day  155 @xcite at a distance of 1.6  kpc @xcite this equates to a projected velocity of @xmath44000  km  s@xmath9 , constant within the errors ( or equivalently negligible deceleration over this period , within measurement uncertainties ) .",
    "this 22  ghz emission is that from the inner shell seen by @xcite , as we discuss below .",
    "however the data are inconsistent with a linear expansion from the time of ejection , as this would require an angular extent of @xmath49  mas on day  0 .",
    "thus these vla data imply a significant deceleration in the first 2  weeks after optical discovery , consistent with results in the x - ray waveband , related to deceleration of the forward shock by @xcite .",
    "we can relate these measurements to resolved structure at 1.667  ghz .",
    "the vlba image at 1.667  ghz on day  63 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - vlba ] ) shows an extent of @xmath4200  mas east  west .",
    "this should have been resolved by the vla on day  59 .",
    "the fact it was not indicates that the more extended features have a spectrum that declines steeply with frequency , consistent with the outlying features being due to non - thermal emission .",
    "this is supported by the limit on the spectral index of @xmath12 .",
    "thus we are able to demonstrate that the initial shell seen by @xcite has a contribution from thermal component ( as it is brightest at the higher frequencies ) , while the more extended emission is entirely non - thermal in nature .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite and strongly confirms the conclusion of @xcite with regard to the 1985 outburst .",
    "this is also comparable to the results of @xcite for for the symbiotic star ch  cyg during ejection episodes .",
    "they found both non - thermal extended jet - like structures and a thermally - dominated central source .",
    "we make use of the formulation of @xcite to estimate the total ejecta mass .",
    "we use the emission on day  4.7 , as at later dates it is not clear what geometry we should use  at this early time the actual distribution of matter in the emission region is most likely to be reasonably represented by a filled sphere . while there are more physically realistic models of the emission geometry possible , the uncertainties make such considerations relatively unimportant .",
    "we make a number of assumptions : that the emission is optically thin , that 50% is thermal , that we can extrapolate back from the t@xmath13 dependence of the 22.48  ghz angular extent to day  4.7 , and finally that the electron temperature is 10@xmath14  k. this gives an angular size of 8.5@xmath00.2  mas ( formal uncertainty ) and a thermal flux density of 13.1@xmath00.1  mjy . from this",
    "we find a mass of 4@xmath02@xmath1  m@xmath2 .",
    "the dependence on electron temperature is very weak ( a power of 0.175 ) so the last assumption has little impact .",
    "the mass depends on the square root of the flux density , so a factor of two larger or smaller only changes the estimate by a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "the strongest dependencies are on angular size and distance .",
    "a 30% larger angular size leads to a 50% larger mass estimate , but such a large size is well outside any reasonable estimate given what we see at later dates .",
    "the dominant uncertainty is in the distance , at 1.6@xmath00.3  kpc @xcite .",
    "this gives most of the 50% fractional uncertainty in the mass estimate . from this",
    "we can see that the radio emission at the earliest times is most consistent with the ejecta mass associated by modelling @xcite with a wd closer to 1.4  m@xmath2 than the lower values considered , excluding cases with recurrence intervals of less than a year .",
    "a higher ejecta mass by a factor of 10 could be made consistent with a lower wd mass of 1.25  m@xmath2 .",
    "we present 63 days of radio observations of the 2006 outburst of rs  oph with merlin and the vla , with reference to additional observations with the vlba , gmrt , effelsberg and ocra - p .",
    "the observations demonstrate that the emission had a mixture of thermal and non - thermal components beginning no later than 13 days after the outburst .",
    "an early radio peak before day 13 is seen for the first time . the early radio rise ( up to day 5.5 )",
    "is consistent with the transition from the `` free  expansion '' phase noted by @xcite and @xcite .    at the minimum between the first and second peaks the flux density declines slightly across the frequency bands ,",
    "consistent with mixed thermal and non  thermal emission , but analysis of our imaging results clearly confirm the non - thermal nature of the most extended components in the vlbi imaging of @xcite . at and after the second peak the spectral behaviour returns to a mixture of thermal and non - thermal emission .",
    "comparison of the 22  ghz vla observation on day  59 with the 1.667  ghz vlba observation on day 63 indicates that the emerging east and west structures are non - thermal in nature with a spectral index @xmath16 . in addition size estimates between days 27 and 59",
    "indicate a decelerating expansion .",
    "we find an ejecta mass of 4@xmath02@xmath1  m@xmath2 , but this is probably a lower limit due to the uncertainty surrounding the overlying absorption component and the assumptions made in making the estimate .",
    "comparison with the modelling of @xcite imply a wd mass around 1.4  m@xmath2 ; a higher ejecta mass would imply a lower wd mass .",
    "this radio development is consistent with two components  an expanding , decelerating shell seen in both non  thermal and thermal emission plus bipolar ejecta generating non  thermal emission , also seen by @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for generating such bipolar structures in this system requires further study , and may tell us more about the mass  loss and mass  transfer processes in recurrent novae .",
    "however it is consistent with the interpretation by @xcite of the only equivalent data for the 1985 outburst , and also similar to the interpretation of radio jets during an outburst of the symbiotic star ch  cygni @xcite .",
    "this is evidence of another non  thermal wd jet from a symbiotic system during an ejection episode .",
