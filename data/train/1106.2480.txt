    "the neutrino oscillation data provide evidence that neutrinos have tiny masses  @xcite , which can be understood as a clear signature for physics beyond the standard model  ( sm ) . the simplest way to obtain neutrino masses may be to introduce @xmath0-singlet right - handed neutrinos , @xmath5 @xmath6 , which have yukawa interaction with the sm higgs boson .",
    "then dirac masses for neutrinos are generated after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , in this naive mechanism , the yukawa coupling constants for neutrinos have to be unnaturally small ( @xmath7 ) in comparison with those for the other fermions .",
    "the most familiar idea to solve the problem would be the seesaw mechanism  @xcite by introducing majorana mass terms for @xmath5 .",
    "taking the majorana masses much larger than vacuum expectation value of the sm higgs boson , very light majorana neutrinos are obtained without excessively small yukawa coupling constants .    another interesting possibility to avoid tiny yukawa coupling constants",
    "is the radiative generation of majorana masses for @xmath8 without dirac mass terms .",
    "the original model was proposed by zee  @xcite , in which majorana neutrino masses are obtained at the one - loop level by the dynamics of the extended higgs sector .",
    "there have been several variant models in this direction  @xcite .",
    "some of them  @xcite include dark matter candidates by imposing an unbroken @xmath3 symmetry which forbids the dirac masses for neutrinos . in those models ( seesaw and radiative ones ) , neutrinos are regarded as majorana particles whose mass terms cause lepton number violating phenomena such as the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "lepton number violation  ( lnv ) , however , has not yet been confirmed by experiments .",
    "thus it is valuable to investigate a possibility that the tiny neutrino masses are generated in theories where the lepton number is conserved and yukawa coupling constants are not extremely small .",
    "radiative generation of masses for dirac neutrinos would be an interesting possibility .",
    "there were several studies in past for such a scenario in various frameworks such as the left - right symmetry  @xcite , supersymmetry  ( susy )  @xcite , and extended models within the sm gauge group  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "the simplest model seems to be the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , where dirac neutrino masses are generated at the one - loop level by introducing two @xmath0-singlet charged scalar fields ( @xmath1 ) as well as @xmath5 . in this letter , we show the one - loop dirac neutrino model  ( 1ldnm ) is compatible with neutrino oscillation data although this was overlooked in @xcite .",
    "we can find parameter sets which satisfy also constraints from searches for lepton flavor violation .",
    "we discuss the collider phenomenology of charged scalars under these parameter sets .",
    "their decay pattern into leptons can be a characteristic feature of the 1ldnm , by which the model could be tested at the lhc and the international linear collider  ( ilc ) .",
    "we also discuss some extensions of the model briefly ; accommodating dark matter candidates , case with majorana masses for @xmath2 , and so on .",

    "three @xmath0-singlet neutral fermions @xmath5 ( @xmath12 ) are introduced such that dirac masses for neutrinos exist .",
    "a softly - broken @xmath3 symmetry is imposed in the model so that dirac masses can be forbidden at the tree level , where @xmath5 are assigned to be @xmath3-odd .",
    "dirac neutrino masses are generated at the one - loop level by utilizing @xmath0-singlet charged scalars , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is taken as a @xmath3-odd particle which can couple with @xmath5 .",
    "the yukawa interactions , the higgs potential , and the dirac neutrino mass generation in this model are presented below in order .",
    "the yukawa interactions for leptons are given by @xmath15 where @xmath11 is the sm higgs doublet field .",
    "the superscript @xmath16 denotes the charge conjugation and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are the pauli matrices .",
    "we take the basis where the yukawa coupling matrix for charged leptons has been diagonalized as @xmath19 .",
    "notice that the matrix @xmath20 is antisymmetric , while the matrix @xmath21 takes somehow an arbitrary form .",
    "although @xmath22 and @xmath23 are basically complex numbers , @xmath23 can be taken to be real numbers by using rephasing of three @xmath9 ( and @xmath10 to keep @xmath19 real ) without loss of generality .",
    "furthermore we can take the basis where @xmath5 are mass eigenstates ( of real positive mass eigenvalues ) . then neutrino oscillation data give relations between the elements of @xmath23 and @xmath22 as shown later .",
    "the higgs potential is written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "although @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be complex parameters , they become real by rephasing @xmath13 and @xmath14 . thus there is no complex parameter in the higgs potential .",

    "the quartic coupling constants should satisfy the following conditions in order to avoid that the potential is unbounded from below ; @xmath28 mass eigenstates of two charged scalar fields are given by a mixing angle @xmath29 as @xmath30 where we used @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",

    "since we are taking the basis where @xmath49 and @xmath5 are mass eigenstates , the dirac mass matrix can be expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( @xmath18 ) are neutrino mass eigenvalues ( @xmath52 ) .",

    "in this section , we consider the constraint from the lepton flavor violating  ( lfv ) decays of charged leptons and the prospect for the lhc physics .",
    "the most stringent constraint on this model from the lfv decays of charged leptons is given by the experimental bound on the branching ratio  ( br ) of @xmath4 , @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio in this model is calculated as @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we ignore fermion masses in the loop integration and the electron mass in the final state . the parameter set  a ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ha])-([eq : mhval ] ) ) results in @xmath91 .",

    "( [ eq : mhval ] ) , ( [ eq : hb ] ) and ( [ eq : fb ] ) ) satisfies the experimental bound with a much smaller value @xmath93 .",
    "this is because @xmath69 and @xmath68 for @xmath61 are proportional to small @xmath94 .",
    "although @xmath95 for the set  b is much larger than @xmath92 , it is also far from experimental sensitivity .    in the 1ldnmthe coupling constants @xmath23 and @xmath22 can be @xmath96 . then the box diagram contributions to @xmath97 , which are proportional to the eighth power of these coupling constants ,",
    "can be smaller than the current experimental upper bound although it becomes crucial in models where some of coupling constants are @xmath98  @xcite .      the charged scalar boson @xmath39 is expected to be produced at the lhc if it is light .",
    "the production cross section via @xmath99 with @xmath100 is 23fb for @xmath101 for example .",
    "the partial decay widths of @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) are given by @xmath104 where fermion masses are neglected .",
    "if @xmath39 is made dominantly from @xmath105 , its decay is determined by @xmath23 . by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fem - n ] ) and ( [ eq : fet - n ] ) for @xmath60 and the tribimaximal mixing , we obtain @xmath106 the set  a ( eqs .",

    "equations  ( [ eq : fem - i ] ) and ( [ eq : fmt - i ] ) for @xmath61 and the tribimaximal mixing give @xmath107 the set  b ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hb ] ) , ( [ eq : fb ] ) , and ( [ eq : mhval ] ) ) gives the same result in a good approximation .",
    "these results are robust because the matrix structure of @xmath108 is restricted very well .",
    "therefore , if @xmath109 , this model predicts @xmath110 . on the other hand ,",

    "then we have @xmath118 as the result , this model is likely to give @xmath119 due to the discussion above .",
    "if @xmath120 is also light and the production cross section is significant , the decays into @xmath121 ( @xmath103 ) smear the relation discussed above to some extent .",
    "otherwise we can test the model at the lhc as well as the ilc by measuring the above characteristic pattern of the decay branching ratios .    the partial decay width for @xmath122 of the sm higgs boson @xmath123 , which is caused at the one - loop level in the sm ,",
    "is affected by additional one - loop diagrams with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the contributions to the sm prediction depend on @xmath124 and @xmath125 as well as higgs masses .",
    "when coupling constant for @xmath126  ( @xmath127 or @xmath128 ) is positive ( negative ) , the additional loop effect from @xmath129 gives a destructive ( constructive ) contribution to the sm prediction .",
    "these contributions can amount to @xmath130 deviations  @xcite .",
    "if such the effect is detected at the lhc when the light sm higgs boson is discovered , it can be an important indirect signature of the charged singlet scalar bosons .",
    "possible extensions of the 1ldnm  are discussed in this section .",
    "first , we try to introduce dark matter candidates which do not exist in the model .",
    "next , we consider the case with lepton number violation . even if lepton number is not conserved and majorana mass terms for @xmath5 are allowed , the mechanism to suppress the dirac mass term is fruitful .",
    "a possibility to accommodate dark matter candidates would be to impose an unbroken @xmath3 symmetry ( we call it @xmath131 ) to this model in addition to the softly - broken @xmath3 symmetry such that all particles in the loop are @xmath131-odd symmetry , lepton number can be used when it is conserved .",
    "for example , a fermion ( boson ) with a lepton number 2 ( 1 ) could be stable . from this point of view",
    ", lepton number conservation seems fit well for introducing dark matter candidates . ] . since the sm charged leptons in the loop in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] can not be @xmath131-odd , they must be replaced by newly introduced @xmath131-odd fermions which can be understood as the fourth generation leptons . the @xmath131-odd dirac neutrino could be the lightest @xmath131-odd particle which is stable .",
    "however , it can not be identified as the dark matter because the spin - independent scattering cross section on a nucleon is too large to satisfy current data of direct searches  @xcite due to the diagram mediated by the @xmath132 boson .",
    "therefore , such a minimal extended model is excluded .",
    "we may consider the other model by taking different scalar particle contents , where the dark matter candidate enters and dirac neutrino masses are induced radiatively .",

    "@xcite where the following exact @xmath131-odd particles are introduced : an @xmath0-doublet scalar field ( @xmath133 ) and a real neutral singlet scalar ( @xmath134 ) as well as a neutral singlet dirac fermion ( @xmath135 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a real scalar dark matter ( @xmath136 or @xmath134 ) and the so - called dirac leptogenesis  @xcite via @xmath135 decay are considered .",

    "the dirac leptogenesis would be also achieved by the decay of @xmath137 .",

    "the detailed study will be presented elsewhere .",
    "there seem to be two possible extensions of this model in order to realise baryogenesis , although the detailed analysis on them is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "one is the electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "the scalar sector should be extended in order to have cp - violating phases and also to achieve strong first order phase transition at the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the other is an application of the dirac leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the leptogenesis is possible without lnv .",
    "the number to be converted to the baryon asymmetry is free from the @xmath5 number because the sphaleron does not act on the gauge singlet fields @xmath5 .",
    "the mechanism to induce the dirac mass terms for neutrinos can be applied also to the lepton number violating case , in which @xmath5 have majorana masses as @xmath139 . then , the type - i seesaw mechanism is realized at the two - loop level via the one - loop induced dirac masses .",
    "this model was studied in refs .",

    "@xmath140 are much lighter than those in the tree - level seesaw mechanism .",
    "consequently , @xmath140 can be at the tev scale without excessive fine tuning on coupling constants .",
    "such tev scale majorana neutrinos could be tested at the lhc as well as the ilc .    in the two - loop seesaw model",
    ", we can remove the soft - breaking term of the @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "then the majorana masses for @xmath8 are generated at the three - loop level and the lightest @xmath2 becomes a dark matter candidate .",
    "this model coincides with the model proposed by krauss , nasri and trodden  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated a simple model ( 1ldnm ) with the mechanism for radiative generation of dirac neutrino masses without introducing lepton number violation . in the 1ldnm ,",
    "the yukawa interaction @xmath141 is absent at the tree level because of the softly - broken @xmath3 symmetry , so that it is induced at the one - loop level by the soft - breaking in the mixing between @xmath105 and @xmath111 .",
    "tiny neutrino masses are generated from the tev scale dynamics .",
    "we have found the model can be compatible with the current neutrino oscillation data as well as lfv search results ( especially for @xmath4 ) .",
    "there is no cp - violating phase in the mns matrix in this model .",
    "it is possible that @xmath92 becomes large enough to be discovered by experiments in near future .",
    "the 1ldnm  is likely to give @xmath119 .",
    "characteristic features of @xmath39 are expected to be tested at the lhc and the ilc .",
