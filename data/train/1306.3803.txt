    "spin - torque oscillator ( sto ) is a nanoscale spintronic device generating periodic microwave ( in the frequency range of several ghz ) oscillations ( see  @xcite for an introductory review ) .",
    "the physics behind these oscillations is based on the spin - transfer torque force , with which a spin - polarized electrical current acts on a free magnet .",
    "sometimes one uses terms `` spin - transfer oscillator '' or `` spin - transfer nano - oscillator '' ( stno ) to describe this object .",
    "the sto consists of two magnetic layers , one ( bottom ) having fixed magnetization @xmath0 is relatively thick , and the other ( top ) with free , precessing magnetization @xmath1 , is relatively thin .",
    "these layers are separated by a non - magnetic spacer .",
    "characteristic widths of 100 nm allow to describe sto as a nano - device .",
    "if the current ( in vertical direction ) is applied , then when passing the fixed layer , the spin directions of the electrons align to the direction of @xmath0 . as these electrons enter the free layer , a spin transfer torque acts on its magnetization @xmath1 , tending to reorient it , as has been theoretically predicted by slonczewski  @xcite and berger  @xcite .",
    "as has been realized by slonczewski  @xcite , the spin transfer torque can compensate the damping of the spin precession of the free layer , and in a constant external magnetic field a sustained oscillation ( rotation of vector @xmath1 ) is observed .",
    "after experimental observation of the generation  @xcite , a lot of attention has been recently attracted to synchronization of stos . indeed , as self - sustained oscillators like electronic generators and lasers",
    ", they must demonstrate typical for this class of physical systems effects of phase locking by external injection , and of mutual synchronization if two or more devices are coupled  @xcite . beside from the fundamental interest , synchronization of stos",
    "is also of high practical relevance , as a way to increase the output power of otherwise rather weak individual stos  @xcite .    in the context of uniform stos ,",
    "the mostly promising way of coupling the stos to achieve synchrony is to connect them in serial electrically via the common microwave current  @xcite ( in experiments @xcite a synchronization of two stos was observed ; however the coupling was not the electrical one , but due to spin waves , as the distance between two stos build on the same mesa was about 500 nm ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite a prototype model for such a coupling has been suggested , where @xmath2 stos are connected in series and are subject to a common dc current , with a parallel resistive load .",
    "the coupling is due to the giant magnetic resistance ( gmr ) effect , as the resistance of an sto @xmath3 depends on the orientation of its magnetization @xmath4 , so that the redistribution of the ac current between the sto array and the load depends on the the average ( over the ensemble of @xmath2 stos ) value of this resistance @xmath5 .",
    "this situation is a typical mean - field coupling of oscillators , mostly prominent examplified by the kuramoto model  @xcite .",
    "this setup has been further studied in @xcite , with a more emphasis on nonlinear dynamical description of the ensemble behavior .",
    "the result of these studies is that synchronization is very hard to achieve , and if it is observed , it is rather sensitive and not robust .",
    "also further numerical simulations  @xcite have shown a large variety of multistable regimes including non - synchronized states .",
    "these observations have been recently confirmed by the analysis of two coupled stos  @xcite .",
    "another approach to study synchronization properties of stos , based not on the exact microscopic equations ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : llgs ] ) below ) , but on general equations for self - sustained oscillators has been proposed in @xcite and followed in  @xcite . because here the resulting dynamics is only suggested based on general qualitative arguments , but not derived from the microscopic equations , predictions for synchronization properties do not extend beyond standard qualitative ones . in particular , in this approach one writes an effective kuramoto - type model for many mutually coupled stos  @xcite , which does not represent the sensitivity observed in the simulation based on the microscopic equations .    in this paper",
    "we study theoretically a serial array of stos subject to a dc current , with a general parallel inductor - capacitor - resistor ( lcr ) load .",
    "this setup is highly motivated by similar studies of synchronization of josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite such a model has been directly compared to the experiments with josephson junctions in a strongly resonant cavity  @xcite .",
    "the lcr load can operate , depending on the frequency , either as an inductive one , or as a capacitive one .",
    "this flexibility allows one to find , similar to the case of josephson junctions , situations with a robust synchronization of stos .",
    "we show also , that transition to synchrony as the parameter ( dc current ) varies , occurs through rather complex states of partial synchrony and clustering , not presented in the standard kuramoto model .",
    "we consider an array of stos with a lcr load as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] .",
    "the equations for the load are @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the time - dependent resistance of the sto array , which is subject to current @xmath8 .",
    "( [ eq : circ ] ) is complemented by the system of equations for stos .",
    "each sto is described by its free - layer magnetization @xmath4 which obeys the landau - lifshitz - gilbert - slonczewski equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gyromagnetic ratio ; @xmath11 is the gilbert damping constant ; @xmath12 contains material parameters ; @xmath13 is the current through the sto ; the effective magnetic field @xmath14 contains an external magnetic field , an easy - axis field , and an easy - plane anisotropy field ; @xmath0 is magnetization of the fixed layer .    following  @xcite we assume that @xmath15 .",
    "then , in spherical coordinates ( @xmath16 ) the llgs equations read  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18    the system is closed by relating the resistance of the array @xmath7 to the states of the stos @xmath19 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the resistance depends on the angle @xmath20 between the magnetizations in the fixed and the free layers . in our case",
    "the magnetization of the fixed layer is along @xmath21-axis , therefore @xmath22 .",
    "it is assumed that the resistance varies between value @xmath23 ( parallel maagnetizations , @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( antiparallel magnetizations , @xmath26 ) according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "then we calculate @xmath7 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 the final system of equations is a combination of eqs .",

    "below we fix parameters of the stos following ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath37 focusing on the dependence on the dimensionless parameters of the load @xmath38 , the coupling parameter @xmath39 , and on the external current @xmath40 .",
    "in the ensembles of globally coupled identical oscillators , different dynamical regimes are generally possible :    * complete synchrony , where states of all oscillators coincide , and coincide also with the mean fields .",
    "the dynamics reduces then to a low - dimensional system that includes the oscillator variables and the global fields ( in our case the variable of the load ) .",
    "this regime is the mostly interesting one from the applied viewpoint , as here all the individual fields are summed coherently and the output field is maximal .",
    "it is , however , mostly boring from the dynamical viewpoint . *",
    "clustered state , where oscillators form several clusters , within each of them their states coincide .",
    "complete synchrony can be considered as the 1-cluster state ; typically prevail states with a small number of clusters , but sometimes several clusters coexist with dispersed oscillators not belonging to clusters .",
    "clustering means strong reduction of the number of independent variables , but the resulting regime can be quite complex as the dimension of the total system is larger than one in the case of complete synchrony . *",
    "asynchronous state , where all the oscillators remain different , and the mean field that mediates the interaction vanishes : one has in fact an ensemble of practically non - interacting elements . * partial synchronization , where the oscillators remain different but the mean fields do not vanish , and have macroscopic ( compared with the finite - size fluctuations ) values .",
    "these regimes are mostly difficult to describe , and a good theory exists in exceptional cases only  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the mean fields may be periodic  @xcite or chaotic  @xcite .",

    "different runs starting from random initial conditions have been performed , and the values in each runs are shown with a marker . thus vertical spreading of markers indicates for multistability ; it is mostly pronounced for @xmath46 , here clusters with different distributions are formed . for @xmath47",
    "one observes a complete synchrony , for @xmath48 an asynchronous state occurs , and for @xmath49 a partial synchrony is observed .",

    "an additional advantage is that the mean field is just the average of @xmath54 : @xmath55 .",
    "unfortunately , rewriting equations in these variables appears not possible , so we use them as `` observables '' to illustrate the dynamics , while performing calculations in the variables @xmath56 .    in the fully synchronous regime system ( [ eq : bas ] ) is a four - dimensional dissipative driven system of odes which in a large range of parameters possess a stable periodic ( with period @xmath57 ) solution ( @xmath58 ) describing sto oscillations .",
    "depending on parameters , this limit cycle passes through a homoclinic bifurcation , at which its period becomes infinite , and the topology of the cycle on the sphere ( @xmath16 ) changes ( which is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cycle](b ) as the transition from a `` small '' to a `` large '' cycle ) .",

    "our next goal is to establish stability of this periodic regime with respect to synchrony breaking . starting with the synchronous solution of system ( [ eq : bas ] ) , we look what happens if just one element of the array slightly deviates from this solution .",
    "this means that we perturb @xmath60 , @xmath61 , while keeping the mean field @xmath36 and the global variables @xmath62 at their values on the limit cycle ( we do not write index at @xmath56 here because any oscillator can be perturbed , equations for the variations do not depend on the index ) . as a result",
