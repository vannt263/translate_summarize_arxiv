    "the huge amount of incoming radiation and ionized particles from space suggests the wide - spread existence of kinetic anisotropies in cosmic plasmas . moreover",
    ", space plasmas are sufficiently dilute and their collisionality is sufficiently low ( see , e.g. , table 8.1 in @xcite ) and , therefore , expected to be far from a maxwellian equilibrium ( only provided by the short - range binary collisions of plasma particles ) .",
    "thus , we have direct proofs from the observations and in - situ measurements that suprathermal populations are widely present at different altitudes in the solar wind plasma @xcite and probably in the solar corona @xcite . these populations exhibit suprathermal high energy tails and are fitted quite well by the family of kappa distribution functions @xcite , which are power laws in particle speed . the kappa distribution generalizes the notion of equilibrium in collisionless plasmas deviated from a thermal ( maxwellian ) equilibrium , and which contain fully developed turbulence in a quasi - stationary equilibrium @xcite . in such plasma systems ,",
    "the temperature is redefined on the basis of a superadditive entropy @xcite .",
    "the so - called kappa distributions are defined by using a spectral index @xmath1 , which determines the slope of the high energy tails in the velocity spectrum of plasma particles . in the limit of very large @xmath2",
    ", the kappa functions degenerate into maxwellians @xcite .",
    "the effects of these suprathermal populations and their anisotropies on the threshold conditions and the linear growth rates of kinetic instabilities have been studied by modeling plasma with diverse anisotropic distributions fully or partially populated by kappa particles @xcite .",
    "these effects largely vary , depending on the shape of the distribution function and the nature and the frequency of the plasma mode .",
    "a selection of kappa distributions and their limiting forms for a large @xmath2 is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , table i. the most simple anisotropic distribution is the bi - kappa distribution function introduced here in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , and which describes a temperature anisotropy , @xmath3 , with the same index @xmath4 for both directions .",
    "this distribution has widely been used for describing kinetic instabilities in a drifting or a non - drifting plasma , e.g , the ion acoustic instability @xcite , the electromagnetic ion - cyclotron and firehose instabilities @xcite , the mirror unstable mode @xcite , the whistler and electron cyclotron instabilities @xcite , and the nonresonant instabilities of weibel - type @xcite .",
    "recently , basu @xcite has reviewed the stability properties of hydromagnetic waves in a plasma distributed after a _ product - bi - kappa _ function such as the one introduced here in eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "the product - bi - kappa distribution function represents a generalization of the kappa - maxwellian distribution , which is a product of a one - dimensional kappa distribution along a preferred direction in space , e.g. , the guiding magnetic field , and a maxwellian distribution in the perpendicular plane @xcite . in a hybrid kappa - maxwellian plasma , unlike a uniform maxwellian or a uniform kappa , the dispersion properties and the stability were found to be markedly changed @xcite .",
    "notable is that , because of the anisotropy of the contours in the velocity space , such a kappa - maxwellian distribution can be unstable even for equal parallel and perpendicular temperatures , or some very well - known unstable modes become stable to a temperature anisotropy in such asymmetric distributions @xcite .",
    "the product - bi - kappa distribution function has not often been applied so far , but we think that this function deserves further consideration for the following reasons : ( 1 ) it decouples the dynamics of the plasma particles over the two principal directions allowing not only for distinct temperatures , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , but for distinct spectral indices , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as well ; ( 2 ) there is a possibility to regulate this coupling in accord to a guiding magnetic field or other external constraints by the interplay of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; ( 3 ) compared to a bi - kappa , a product - bi - kappa distribution allows for a more realistic description and ( 4 ) enlarges the number of distributions with an elaborated dispersion approach ; ( 5 ) one more important feature ( recently revealed for a similar kappa - maxwellian plasma @xcite ) is that such a product - bi - kappa model permits further analytical progress leading to tractable expressions for the dielectric tensor elements enabling , for example , the investigation of oblique modes in a magnetized plasma .",
    "electromagnetic instabilities of the weibel - type @xcite are driven by an arbitrary deviation of the particle velocity distribution from its equilibrium , whether it is a bulk ( relative ) motion of streaming particles @xcite or a temperature anisotropy @xcite .",
    "kinetic anisotropies are ubiquitous in space plasmas ( extending from heating flows and temperature anisotropies to particle jets and shock waves in outflows , or interpenetrating plasma shells in interplanetary wind ) and , presently , weibel instabilities are invoked in a large variety of astrophysical scenarios .",
    "these instabilities create magnetic field such as the cosmological seeds necessary for the dynamo mechanism @xcite , or a quasi - stationary magnetic field boost for the synchrotron emissions in astrophysical sources @xcite .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field fluctuations observed in interplanetary space are also attributed to these instabilities ( e.g. , filamentation , whistler , mirror , oblique firehose ) @xcite , which compete with other constraints of plasma particles ( adiabatic expansion , coulomb collisions ) and maintain a relatively small temperature anisotropy in the solar wind @xcite .    here",
    "we discuss the weibel instability driven by a temperature anisotropy of plasma particles .",
    "recent studies of this instability have been limited to a bi - kappa distribution and found that the instability is suppressed in the presence of the kappa tails @xcite .",
    "for the same arguments formulated above , we investigate here the product - bi - kappa distribution as a favorable alternative that seems to add an excess of free energy in the velocity space , and to enhance the instability . in the present paper",
    "we proceed to a comparative analysis of the effects of these two distributions , the bi - kappa and the product - bi - kappa , on the weibel instability .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be collisionless and spatially homogeneous .    in order to describe the initially unperturbed plasma system",

    "[ fig1 ] are very suggestive : if we compare contours in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , the bi - kappa is less asymmetric than the bi - maxwellian leading to lower growth rates of the weibel instability , while the product - bi - kappa is more asymmetric than the bi - maxwellian and enhances the instability .    the temperature anisotropy threshold for the weibel instability can be drastically reduced in anisotropic plasmas with product - bi - kappa distribution functions that suggests two possible explanations : either the fundamental notions , such as the temperature or the temperature anisotropy must be redefined for these kappa distributions , or the temperature anisotropy is not an exclusive source of free energy for this instability .",
    "these results can easily be extended to high beta plasmas ( @xmath56 = thermal energy / magnetic energy ) widely present in space and where the ambient magnetic field has only a minor influence without changing the essential features of the instability , but sustaining such asymmetric distributions with @xmath57 due to some equilibration and isotropization in the perpendicular plane , and a preferential motion and acceleration along the magnetic field .",
