    "many biological systems display self organization , arising from specific local interactions between the various constituents .",
    "the fact that global behaviors emerge because of local interactions has led to question whether biological systems are poised at criticality @xcite .",
    "recent work has highlighted such a possibility in systems ranging from gene expression @xcite , evolutionary ecology @xcite to neural networks @xcite .",
    "neural networks are biological systems with inherently many body interactions .",
    "criticality of retinal neurons have been studied by @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the spiking of retinal neurons was recorded when it was subject to external stimulus .",
    "the spikes were binned in appropriate time intervals , leading to patterns made up of binary bits , akin to the up and down state of spin , with neuron firing corresponding to @xmath1 and non - firing to @xmath2 .",
    "the frequencies of occurrences of these patterns were then fit with an ising like model .",
    "with the model fit , criticality was then explored in the retinal system by calculating its specific heat .",
    "critical points are identifiable at divergences in the specific heat and for their finite sized data , they identified a possible divergence at the operating temperature of the network , namely @xmath3 .    since ,",
    "criticality is only observed in statistical mechanical systems in the large n limit , there was a need to expand the data sets .",
    "in @xcite the construction of larger data sets from smaller one s involved sampling from a distribution of the average spiking @xmath4 and the correlation between the spikes @xmath5 . this then guaranted the larger data set has the same distribution as the smaller data set .",
    "since this expansion of data was done computationally the expanded data sets even though large did not approach the large n limit .",
    "however , it was noticed that as the size of the constructed data set increased , the specific heat peaked closer and closer to @xmath3 .",
    "this suggested a possible divergence in the specific heat at @xmath3 as the system size increased , re - enforcing the possibility that the retinal network was operating at or near the critical point .    in this work",
    "we develop a methodology to expand the data sets analytically and show that the evaluated critical temperature could be very much dependent on how the data set is expanded , despite the mirage of them having a unique critical temperature when expanded computationally .",
    "we analyze the salamander retinal neurons data set used by @xcite , to show that the values of the critical temperature are very much dependent on how the dataset is expanded , implying that not all data sets available from experiments are amenable for expansion in order to study criticality .",
    "recently @xcite have proposed a formalism to understand criticality by taking in to account the temporal dynamics of biological systems . @xcite",
    "have talked about the zipf s law distributions and hence criticality arising naturally when one of the fluctuating variables in the system is hidden .",
    "@xcite constructed models that are consistent with distribution of global network activity .",
    "@xcite , @xcite have proposed new ideas in modeling efforts to understand criticality in vertebrate retina .",
    "the work by @xcite tried to model higher order correlations within cortical microcolumns . @xcite",
    "have suggested an alternative way of understanding criticality by linking criticality to the exact inference of the probability distributions describing the data set .",
    "however , available experimental data sets are made up of a finite number of observables and hence methods to extend available data sets to infinite number of observables are needed so that their critical behavior can be assessed .",
    "the work done in this paper addresses this crucial task of analytically extending the data set to the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "@xcite tried to understand whether biological systems are at a critical point by looking at the data coming from a smaller subsystem of a large system .",
    "the procedure they followed was to fit the average values @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the smaller subsystem , by using a boltzmann distribution with a hamiltonian @xmath8 .",
    "critical properties could only be ascertained by a knowledge of the larger system of which the system is a subsystem of .",
    "assume that the hamiltonian of the larger system is labeled as @xmath9 . since the larger system should have the same @xmath6 and @xmath10 distribution as the smaller subsystem",
    ", one could evaluate @xmath9 by choosing the neurons of the larger system , such that one gets the same distribution for @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the larger system as the smaller subsystem.@xcite constructed the larger system in this way and found that the position of the specific heat peaks closer to @xmath3 with increasing system size . because their expansion of data set was done computationally",
    ", they could only conjecture the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the aim of our paper is to show that the evaluated value of the critical temperature is very much dependent on how the original data set is expanded . in this paper",
    "we consider a particular way of expanding the data set which allows for an exactly solvable large @xmath0 limit . in order to get the large @xmath0 limit to be exactly solvable",
    "we resort to replicating each neuron @xmath11 times as is elaborated below .",
    "we could have replicated each neuron in the original data set @xmath0 times and then taken @xmath12 as a possible way of expanding the data set .",
    "this would have kept the same distribution of the @xmath13 and @xmath7 as the original system .",
    "but this would only give us just one realization of expanding the original data set using the method of replication . in order to get a large number of realizations of the expanded data with the same distributions of the @xmath13 and @xmath7 as the original data set ,",
    "we instead first expand the original data set to an ensemble of middle subsystems which have the same distributions of the @xmath13 and @xmath7 as the original data set and then replicate each neuron in each of the middle subsystems @xmath0 times , so that we get an exact solution of the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "this would then produce an ensemble of large @xmath0 data sets , which have the same distribution of @xmath13 and @xmath7 as the original data set , so that a statistical study of the critical temperatures could be carried out .    with this in mind ,",
    "let us first construct a middle subsystem by choosing @xmath13 and @xmath7 from the distribution of smaller subsystem .",
    "this would then imply that the middle subsystem has the _ same distribution _ as the smaller subsystem .",
    "let us then construct the larger subsystem as talked below .",
    "we construct @xmath9 by replicating each neuron from the middle subsystem @xmath0 times .",
    "now , consider the hamiltonian @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the sum of all @xmath16 which are the replicas neuron @xmath17 in the middle subsystem. @xmath18 is the number of neurons in the middle subsystem .",
    "because of the form of the above hamiltonian we have the relations @xmath19 this implies that we have @xmath0 copies of @xmath6 , the first moments of the middle subsystem in the larger system , as well as @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "next , @xmath14 can be written as @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath23 hence the partition function can be written down as @xmath24 , j\\in[1,n ] } e^{-\\beta h_{large}}=\\sum_{m_i } f(m_i ) e^ {   -n\\beta [ \\sum_{i=1,m } h_i { m_i } + \\sum_{ij=1,m } j_{ij } { m_i}{m_j}]}\\ ] ] where we are summing over all possible values taken by @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the number of ways of getting the value @xmath25 by all possible combinations of @xmath27 for @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "this is well known and the answer goes as @xmath29 which for @xmath11 becomes @xmath30 and hence the partition function becomes @xmath31 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1,m } ( 1+m_i ) \\ln ( 1+m_i ) + \\sum_{i=1,m } ( 1-m_i)\\ln(1-m_i)]}\\ ] ] in the large @xmath0 approximation the partition function is dominated by the saddle point and hence the solution is @xmath32 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1,m}(1 + m_i ) \\ln ( 1+m_i ) + \\sum_{i=1,m } ( 1-m_i)\\ln(1-m_i)]= 0\\ ] ] which then gives us @xmath33    the aim in constructing the larger data set is to make sure that the distribution of the correlations between the neurons @xmath34 in the middle subsystem is replicated into the larger data set .",
    "however since one can not have correlations between a neuron and itself we should have that @xmath21",
    ".    in our larger data set the correlations between neurons have the form @xmath35    the way the hamiltonian is written would imply that @xmath36 of the expectation values given by @xmath37 for particular values of @xmath38 $ ] and the @xmath36 possible combinations of @xmath39 $ ] are equal to each other . or , @xmath40 .",
    "also , all the @xmath41 for a particular value of @xmath42 $ ] and all values of @xmath43 $ ] are equal to each other . or @xmath44 .",
    "this would immediately imply that @xmath45 for particular values of with @xmath38 $ ] with @xmath46 and the @xmath36 possible combinations of @xmath39 $ ] are equal to each other .",
    "and hence we would have a replication of the @xmath47 from the middle subsystem in to the larger data set , if we set @xmath47 from the middle subsystem into @xmath45 in the expanded data set .",
    "however , the larger data set also comes up with additional correlations between neurons given by @xmath48 , for @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "again by construction for each value of @xmath49 , all the @xmath50 s are equal to each other . hence , if we want to keep the distribution of the @xmath47 from the middle subsystem into the larger data set we should pick the @xmath51 from the @xmath47 distribution of the middle subsystem. now the mean field solution can be written down as @xmath52 the above equation implies that @xmath53_{il }   \\label{mean_field2}\\ ] ] if @xmath54 and @xmath55_{ii }    \\label{mean_field3}\\ ] ] keeping in line with the logic elaborated above we hence choose @xmath56 from the middle subsystem for @xmath21 and @xmath57 s are chosen from the distribution of @xmath47 with @xmath21 from the middle subsystem.    as shown in the appendix the critical temperature is then given by the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath58 .",
    "we analyzed the the neuronal firing data from a salamander retina by using the methodology explained above .",
    "this data was earlier analyzed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the data from @xmath59 neurons was binned in @xmath60ms bins .",
    "@xcite suggested that @xmath3 was the critical point for the system when extrapolated to the large n limit . in fig.[criticality_picture ] we plot the results of our evaluations using the methodology outlined above .",
    "the x - axis plots the size @xmath18 of the middle subsystem , while the y - axis plots the logarithm of the critical temperature @xmath61 .",
    "as we can see the value of the critical temperature is nowhere close to @xmath3 , but the mean value of @xmath61 varies as a function of the value of @xmath18 from @xmath62 for @xmath63 , to @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "this shows that the value of the critical temperature is very much dependent on how the data set is expanded .",
    "since the evalutions involved estimating the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath58 , we could only computationally work with values of @xmath18 which are bounded .",
    "however , the fact that the @xmath25 s and @xmath47 s are chosen from a distribution implies that the evaluation of the eigenvalues of @xmath58 for @xmath66 turns in to a problem in random matrix theory .",
    "this hence becomes a problem with potential for future research .",
    "the mean field solution eq .",
    "( [ mean_field ] ) can be derived by the minimization of the free energy functional    @xmath67    since @xmath25 is smaller than one , we can expand the logarithms in a power series , that gives    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the identity matrix .",
    "we can then construct a basis in which @xmath70 is diagonal . in this basis",
    "we have @xmath71 . here",
    "@xmath72 is a matrix that diagonalizes @xmath73 , i.e @xmath74 is diagonal .",
    "substituting for @xmath25 the above equation becomes    @xmath75 ^ 4}{12}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 are the eigenvalues of @xmath77 .",
    "now , if we make the @xmath78 s heterogeneous we have to include a energy cost that can be written as @xmath79 , leading to the minimum that is a homogeneous solution .",
    "talking about correlation lengths in field theory requires the presence of a gradient term and hence the motivation behind its introduction here .",
    "the free energy becomes    @xmath80 ^ 4}{12}-\\beta \\sum_i h_i\\sum_j   \\lambda_{ij } m_j]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath81 is the volume @xmath82 , @xmath83 is a constant with dimension of @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath83 is related to the energy scale @xmath85 of the field theory above as @xmath86",
    ". we can redefine our fields @xmath87 so that @xmath18 has a dimension of @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "the quadratic terms in the above expression would then look like @xmath89\\ ] ] implying that @xmath90 is the correlation length for the field @xmath78 .",
    "the values of @xmath61 for which a particular @xmath76 becomes equal to zero hence corresponds to the limit in which the correlation length for that @xmath78 s diverges .",
    "this is also the critical temperature for parameter @xmath78 implying that it changes continuously from zero to a finite value around this temperature when the @xmath91 are zero .",
    "the largest value of @xmath61 for which the correlation length of any of the @xmath78 diverges is then the critical temperature of the system because this is the temperature below which any linear combination of the @xmath78 s starts becoming non - zero .",
    "this value of @xmath61 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath58 .",
    "what we have seen in this work through an analysis of the system of retinal neurons in @xcite is that the evaluation of the critical temperature of a system by expanding a system such that the distribution of the moments of the original system are preserved does not guarantee a unique value of the critical temperature , but the evaluated value of the critical temperature is very much dependent on the details in which the data is expanded . in order to understand the possible reasons behind this , let us note that first of all the expanding the dataset keeping the moments of the data fixed is only an expression about the intution that a system could be essentially a sum of its parts .",
    "hence systems which are homogenous could be studied by analyzing a part of the system .",
    "this was the logic given behind analysis of the salamander retina in @xcite .",
    "this has nothing to do with the criticality of the systems .",
    "if the properties of the system that are evaluated are dependent on how the system is expanded it could imply many things .",
    "one possible implication is that the subsystem from which the data set is taken is too small and hence repeating this subsystem does not lead to the production of the entire system .",
    "another possible implication is that the larger system is not plainly a repetition of smaller subunits .",
    "these have nothing to do with the problem of expanding the data set , but only are issues related to the constraints imposed by the system one is analyzing . a system",
    "whose subsystem from which data is taken is essentially a replica of copies of this subsystem would then give a critical temperature which is unchanged by how the data set is expanded .",
    "however even then the system may not have its critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "it is only systems that are poised at criticality which would have their critical temperature at @xmath3 .",
    "it is in order to answer this question whether such systems are poised at criticality that our method of expanding the dataset obtained from a subsystem to its large @xmath0 limit will be valuable .",
