    "water displays many thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies @xcite .",
    "although the origin of these anomalies can usually be traced back to the properties of hydrogen bonding between water molecules , their quantitative understanding is a goal to which a great deal of effort is being devoted .",
    "experiments show that these anomalies are evident where liquid water is stable , but are stronger below the melting line where water is supercooled , i.e. metastable with respect to crystal ice .",
    "bulk water can be kept in this supercooled state down to about 235 k at 1 atm @xcite .",
    "the experimental limit of stability of supercooled water with respect to crystal ice defines the homogeneous crystallization temperature @xmath3 , which reaches its lowest value of 181 k at about 2000 atm . in an attempt to rationalize these anomalies ,",
    "several ideas have been proposed , including the stability limit ( sl ) conjecture @xcite , the liquid - liquid critical point ( llcp ) scenario @xcite , the singularity - free ( sf ) hypotheses @xcite , and the critical point free ( cpf ) scenario @xcite .",
    "all these stimulating ideas are consistent with the experimental properties of water , but hypothesize different behaviors below @xmath3 .",
    "although these differences can not be directly tested in experiments , their implications in the interpretation of water properties could be different , or could be relevant for other anomalous liquids @xcite .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to test these hypothesis in theoretical models .",
    "many authors resort to computer simulations of detailed models of water ( see for example @xcite for a short updated list ) .",
    "however , this approach , both for molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite or monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite , faces the problem of large computational times near @xmath3 , because water equilibration time increases in an exponential way for decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "an alternative approach , which we follow here , is to consider a coarse - grained model of water that allows to perform , on the one hand , efficient mc simulations and , on the other hand , theoretical calculations . in particular",
    ", we focus on a model for a water monolayer confined between hydrophobic walls @xcite .",
    "the interest for this case comes from the fact that , under appropriate conditions , the formation of ice can be avoided in experiments with water under confinement @xcite .",
    "we consider here only the case of confinement between infinite hydrophobic walls , while other kind of confinements , mimicking porous hydrophobic materials , have been considered in other works @xcite .",
    "the coarse - grained model considered here allows to gain an insight into the properties of the scenarios that have been proposed for supercooled water .",
    "in particular , it is possible to show that within the framework of this model all the scenarios proposed for supercooled water differ only in the relative strength of the directional ( covalent ) and the many - body ( cooperative ) component of the hydrogen bond ( hb ) @xcite .",
    "when the many - body hb component is strong and the directional hb component is weak , the model recovers the cpf scenario , and shows that it coincides with the sl case .",
    "when the many - body hb component is zero , the model reproduces the sf scenario for any finite directional hb component .",
    "finally , for intermediate values of the two hb components , the model recovers the llcp scenario , with the liquid - liquid phase transition having a negative slope in the pressure - temperature ( @xmath4 ) phase diagram .",
    "the llcp occurs at positive or negative pressure depending of the relative strength of the many - body hb component with respect to the directional hb component @xcite .",
    "direct experimental evaluation of the relative strengths of the two hb components is not straightforward , but indirect evaluations are consistent with values that , for the model , would predict the llcp scenario @xcite .      among the many dynamics anomalies of water",
    ", we will focus here on the behavior of translational ( self)diffusion constant @xmath5 . in normal liquids",
    "@xmath5 decreases when @xmath1 increases at constant @xmath2 , while water displays a large increase of @xmath5 in a delimited region of @xmath1-@xmath2 @xcite , e. g. , with an enhancement of about 60% at 243  k when @xmath1 increases from 0.1  mpa to 150  mpa @xcite .",
    "the increase is observed up to about 200  mpa @xcite .",
    "computer simulations of bulk water with detailed models ( see ref.s  @xcite and references therein ) and lattice models ( e. g. @xcite ) can reproduce , at least qualitatively , the anomalous behavior of @xmath5 . by analyzing the microscopic structure of water molecules in the region of the anomalous increase of @xmath5 ,",
    "several authors have proposed a relation between the behavior of @xmath5 and the structure of water .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite relates @xmath5 to the configurational entropy , ref .",
    "@xcite associates the minima in @xmath5 with a maximum in orientational order , and ref .",
    "@xcite shows , for a water - like isotropic potential , the connection of the anomaly in @xmath5 , and in other quantities , with the density dependence of the entropy in excess over the entropy of the ideal gas . in particular , by classical molecular dynamic simulations it has been observed that the increase of @xmath1 weakens the hydrogen bonds , and thus increases @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this interpretation in terms of defects in the hb network can be extended to negative @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a similar qualitative conclusion has been reached also by ab initio molecular dynamics showing that @xmath5 is directly linked to network imperfections @xcite . nevertheless , a quantitative relation between the anomalous behavior of @xmath5 and the microscopic structure of water is still missing .    in confinement ,",
    "experiments show controversial results . without the aim of reviewing the relevant literature , we recall here , as examples , that the reduction of water @xmath5 can be of up to two orders of magnitude between 260 k and 310 k , in hydrophilic nax and naa zeolites @xcite , or that the viscosity of water between two hydrophilic surfaces , with @xmath6  nm interfacial separation , is seven orders of magnitude greater than that of bulk water at room temperature @xcite .",
    "other experiments display that @xmath5 decreases if the confinement increases , e. g. in mcm-41 with pore radius between 1 nm and 2 nm @xcite or mcm-48 with pore radius of about 1 nm @xcite , both slightly hydrophilic due to the oxygen atoms in the silica structure , with the first considered more hydrophobic than the second .",
    "similar results were observed for channels of closed multiwalled hydrophobic carbon nanotubes with diameter between 2 nm and 5 nm @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , other experiments reveal an exceptionally fast mass transport for water confined in carbon nanotubes of about 2 nm @xcite and 7 nm radius @xcite .",
    "computer simulations have been performed to rationalize the different experiments . by md",
    "it has been found a decrease of @xmath5 with decrease of separation between two hydrophilic surfaces at nanoscopic distance for spc / e water @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown for the same model that the decrease of hydration largely decreases the mobility of water molecules near the surface of mcm-41 or vycor , consistent with the interpretation that at low hydration the majority of them are bonded to the surface @xcite .    in the case of hydrophobic confinement ,",
    "the results are more controversial .",
    "md of tip5p water nanoconfined between hydrophobic smooth walls displays anomalous @xmath5 @xcite , but only in the direction parallel to the walls @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 results to be two orders of magnitude smaller than in bulk and with the anomaly occurring in confinement at lower @xmath2 than in bulk @xcite .",
    "a similar large decrease of mobility has been reported at ambient conditions for spc / e water between two large hydrophobic graphite - like plates for separations below 1.3 nm @xcite . nevertheless , first ",
    "principle md simulations of the same model in similar conditions show that the diffusion of water molecules become faster under confinement , possibly due to weaker hbs at the interface @xcite .",
    "a similar controversy is reported for simulations of water in carbon nanotubes , with radii below 1  nm @xcite .",
    "our approach to the problem is to study by mc the local dynamics of a coarse - grained model of confined water that will be defined in detail in the following .",
    "the results described in the previous section for this model have been derived by free - energy calculations within mean  field approach and efficient mc simulations . in particular",
    ", a cluster mc dynamics allows to easily equilibrate the model at any @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this specific mc approach is based on a mapping of the thermodynamic model into a geometrical problem , using an appropriate extension of the correlated - percolation approach @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as an alternative it is possible to adopt a local mc algorithm with the aim of studying the dynamic behavior of the model and compare it with the experimental behavior of water @xcite .",
    "this kind of study is useful for systems at equilibrium , although approaching a glassy dynamics @xcite , and makes the plausible assumption that , at a given @xmath2 and @xmath1 , the mc time step can be converted into real time units by a factor that does not depend on time .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) , according to which the long - time relaxation ( @xmath7-relaxation ) dynamics should be independent of the microscopic dynamics @xcite , as tested in lennard - jones mixtures @xcite .",
    "however , the comparison must be performed with caution , because the time conversion factor for a given observable could depend on both @xmath2 and @xmath1 , when the interactions are non - isotropic @xcite .",
    "this dependence can be estimated by comparing mc results with experiments , as done by mazza et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite for the model under consideration here .",
    "the comparison shows a linear relation between the logarithms of time in real units and time in mc step at different @xmath2 and constant @xmath1 @xcite , corresponding to a power - law relation between the two times .",
    "this relation can be easily understood in the context of the present coarse - grained model , at least at low @xmath2 . at low enough @xmath2 , both the experimental time and",
    "the mc time follows a generalized arrhenius relation @xcite where the characteristic @xmath2-dependent activation energy corresponds to the energy needed to break a hb .",
    "the power - law relation between the two times turns out to be a consequence of the choice of the model parameters that implies a hb energy lower than in experiments .",
    "therefore , by choosing appropriate model parameters the two times would be directly proportional , with a proportionality factor that would not depend on @xmath2 at constant @xmath1 .    with this caveat in mind",
    ", we perform here an extensive mc study of the thermodynamic and dynamic behavior of the coarse - grained model , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a water monolayer confined between hydrophobic walls .",
    "in particular , we consider the case in which water molecules can diffuse .",
    "we identify the region where diffusion has an anomaly behavior , finding maxima and minima of the diffusion coefficient at fixed @xmath2 , and we discuss how this anomaly is related to other anomalies of water .    in particular",
    ", thanks to the feature that the model can be tuned from one scenario to another@xcite , we can test if the diffusion anomaly is related to some specific scenario for the thermodynamics of the system at much lower @xmath2 . specifically , we consider the llcp and the sf scenarios .",
    "we do not observe any relevant differences in the region where the system displays diffusion anomaly .",
    "we finally investigate the very low @xmath2 dynamics , observing a subdiffusive regime and the approach to a glassy state at any @xmath1 . under these conditions ,",
    "we observe density minima , resembling recent experiments @xcite and md simulations @xcite . in the present model ,",
    "the density minima appear in the vicinity of the glassy state and as a consequence of the breaking of hbs to rearrange water molecules for a better matching with the local order .",
    "in particular , we observe that if the model does not take into account the many - body interaction , the density minima are largely reduced .",
    "we consider a water monolayer confined between two hydrophobic smooth walls with double periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the walls are separated by a distance of about @xmath8  nm . the system is considered at constant number @xmath9 of water molecules , constant @xmath2 and constant @xmath1 , leaving the volume @xmath10 free to change . for a tip5p - water monolayer confined between hydrophobic walls",
    "it has been observed that , depending on the separation @xmath11 , water is liquid or forms a quasi - two - dimensional square ice for temperatures ranging between 260 k and 300 k , and negative lateral pressure @xcite .",
    "the square symmetry is a consequence of the distortion imposed by the walls to the tetrahedral hb network that would otherwise form in bulk water . consistently with these findings",
    ", we divide the available volume @xmath10 into @xmath12 square cells , each with volume @xmath13 , square section of size @xmath14 and height @xmath11 , and hydrate the system with @xmath15 water molecules .    in our coarse - graining",
    "we assume that each cell can at most host one water molecule . therefore , if @xmath16 , then each cell has one molecule and the system is homogeneous in density . if @xmath17 , some cells are empty .",
    "to each cell we associate an occupation variable @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) if it is vacant or occupied , respectively . having only one water molecule per cell between the walls , for the sake of simplicity , we reduce the description of the monolayer to a two - dimensional system .    the water - water interaction is decomposed into three terms . the first accounts for all the isotropic contributions , including short - range electronic orbitals repulsion and van der waals attraction , and",
    "is represented by a lennard - jones potential truncated at a hard - core diameter @xmath20 @xmath21 & { \\rm for } \\",
    "r > r_0,\\cr \\end{cases } \\label{lj}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the interaction energy and @xmath23 is the distance between two molecules . in the coarse - grained representation , @xmath23 is the distance between the center of occupied cells .",
    "the hard - core diameter @xmath20 is introduced to simplify the implementation of the model and our tests show that the results do not depend on its existence .",
    "we set @xmath24   , the water van der waals diameter @xcite , and @xmath25  kj / mol , consistent with the value 5.5 kj / mol of the estimate of the van der waals attraction based on isoelectronic molecules at optimal separation @xcite .    the second term of water - water interaction accounts for the directional ( covalent ) component of the hb formation @xcite , with a characteristic energy that we set @xmath26  kj / mol .",
    "to account for the directionality we adopt a geometrical definition in which the hb breaks if @xmath27",
    ". therefore , only 1/6 of the orientation range @xmath28 $ ] in the oh  o plane is associated with a bonded state .",
    "we therefore associate to each molecule @xmath29 a bonding index @xmath30 $ ] with a discrete number of states @xmath31 describing the bonding state with a neighbor molecule @xmath32 , and choose @xmath33 to account for the entropy loss associated with the formation of a hb . due to the square symmetry , each molecule has four neighbors and four bonding indices @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , each molecule has @xmath35 possible bonding states . to form a hb between two molecules in two",
    "occupied neighboring cells @xmath29 and @xmath32 ( hence @xmath36 ) we assume that the two facing bonding indices @xmath34 and @xmath37 are in the same state , i.e. @xmath38 , with @xmath39 if @xmath40 , and @xmath41 otherwise .",
    "therefore , the directional term of the hb can be expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of hbs and the sum runs over all nearest - neighbor cells .",
    "the directional interaction of hbs leads to local reduction of density as a consequence of the reduced nearest neighbors with respect to close molecular packing .",
    "this property is at the origin of the macroscopic density maximum that occurs at @xmath44c at ambient pressure , a temperature below which the number of hbs per molecule is about 3 @xcite .",
    "the effect can be observed in experiments mainly as a change in the structure of the second shell of water molecules @xcite . nevertheless , to include the effect in a tractable way in the coarse - grained model , we follow ref.@xcite and consider that each formed hb leads to a small increase of volume @xmath45 per molecule , where @xmath46 is the average density increase from low density ice ih to high density ices vi and viii and @xmath47 is our approximation to the van der waals volume of a molecule .",
    "therefore , the total volume occupied by water is @xmath48 note that the increase @xmath45 corresponds to a larger volume per molecule , but not to a larger separation @xmath23 between molecules , hence it does not affect the radial term in [ lj ] .",
    "the last term we include in the water interaction energy is a many - body ( cooperative ) interaction among hbs , that favors specific values of the probability distribution of o  o  o angles @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a brief description of the quantum origin of the cooperative interaction ) .",
    "furthermore , the probability distribution of o  o  o changes when comparing bulk and confined water @xcite , showing the disappearing of the fifth interstitial neighbor in the confined case , and a shift of the maximum of the distribution toward @xmath49 at low @xmath2 , consistent with the symmetry chosen for the coarse - graining in our model . to account for this cooperative interaction ,",
    "we include in the model the term @xmath50 where @xmath51 stands for the six different pairs of four bonding indices of a molecule @xmath29 , and @xmath52 is related to the energy gain when the bonding indices order in the same state , with the maximum gain @xmath53 per molecule , corresponding to the fully ordered case .",
    "as shown by stokely et al .",
    "@xcite , by setting the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath54 and @xmath45 to finite values and tuning the parameter @xmath52 , it is possible to reproduce all the scenarios that have been proposed for supercooled water .",
    "here we consider two cases : ( i ) @xmath55 kj / mol , corresponding to the llcp scenario , and ( ii ) @xmath56 , corresponding to the sf scenario .",
    "the choice in ( i ) is consistent with the experimental measure of hbs in ice ih , approximately 3 kj / mol stronger than in liquid water @xcite .",
    "if we entirely attribute this increase to the cooperative component of the hb @xcite , we find @xmath57 kj / mol for the two molecules forming the hb ( each with an energy gain in absolute value @xmath58 ) , which is consistent with our choice .",
    "the water - wall interaction is represented by a hard - core exclusion .",
    "although the interaction of water with a hydrophobic , infinitely large , object could have a small attractive van der waals component or a soft repulsion , for the sake of simplicity we assume here that the main effect of the confining walls is to inhibit the formation of ice , as observed by zangi and mark for @xmath59 nm @xcite .",
    "therefore , the enthalpy of the system at pressure @xmath1 is @xmath60 for a given occupancy ratio @xmath61 , the state of the system is fully specified by the average number density @xmath62 and the set of @xmath34 .",
    "we perform mc simulations in the @xmath63 ensemble for a system partitioned into @xmath64 square cells and an occupancy ratio @xmath65 , corresponding to @xmath66 water molecules .",
    "since we allow for changes of the volume in the direction parallel to the walls , the control parameter @xmath1 represents the pressure parallel to the walls . to test for size effects , we consider also @xmath67 and @xmath68 at the same @xmath69 occupancy ratio , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "our results do not show any appreciable size effect among these three cases .",
    "likewise , we do not find any significant differences for occupancy ratios between @xmath69 and @xmath72 .",
    "mc and mean - field results for this model at full occupancy @xcite were reported in previous works @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the differences between partial and full occupancy will be presented elsewhere .    to generate equilibrium configurations we pick at random a cell @xmath73 and an integer @xmath74 . if @xmath75 , we choose at random one of the four neighboring cells of the cell @xmath29 and , if empty , we displace into it the molecule @xmath29 with probability given by the following [ metro ] of a metropolis algorithm .    if @xmath76 we set the bonding index @xmath34 to any of the @xmath31 possible states , independent of its original state , and accept the change with probability in [ metro ] .",

    "these transformations are meant to give the order of magnitude of the calculated quantities .    in the calculation of the lennard - jones interaction energy in [ lj ]",
    "we test that there is no appreciable difference if we introduce a cut - off at the 9th neighbor for the maximum interaction range . to allow for a better equilibration of the system , we follow an annealing protocol along isobars , starting at high @xmath2 , with @xmath12 cells randomly occupied by @xmath9 water molecules , each molecule having a random configuration of bonding indices , and with the total volume @xmath88 .",

    "although the present model does not include any representation for the crystal , because we make the hypothesis that crystallization is avoided under the conditions considered here , our finding of the change of slope of the iso-@xmath0 lines suggests that the shape of the melting line in nanoconfinement could resemble that of bulk water .",

    "the proposed rationale is that the subdiffusive behavior is due to the heterogeneity of the surface and of the water - surface interaction .",

    "this is no longer true at @xmath135  gpa ( [ phase - diagram ] ) and can be understood in the framework of this model , because , as we will show in the next subsections , for @xmath135  gpa the number of hbs vanishes at low @xmath2 ( [ nhb ] ) .",
    "but for @xmath122  gpa , with parameters as in [ phase - diagram ] ( squares ) and with @xmath136 ( circles ) .",
    "the density minimum occurs also when @xmath136.,width=453 ]    although for @xmath137 our mc simulations become subdiffusive , we find that we can equilibrate the hbs dynamics within our simulation time for temperatures as low as 190  k at 0.02  gpa , or 163  k at 0.12  gpa .",
    "specifically , we find that the relaxation time of the bonding indices @xmath34 , related to the formation of the hbs , is of the order of @xmath138  ns for these state points , while it exceeds our simulation time at lower @xmath2 , e. g. at about 170  k for @xmath122  gpa @xcite .    in the region of state points",
    "where we can equilibrate the system , but close to the lowest well - equilibrated temperature , we observe a minimum in density along isobars with @xmath139  gpa ( [ density ] ) .",
    "this result resembles the experimental density minimum for water confined in a nanoporous silica matrix mcm-41 with a pore diameter of 1.4  nm found by mallamace et al .",
    "@xcite .    from our simulations for @xmath140  gpa , at atmospheric pressure",
    "we extract a density minimum of about @xmath141  g/@xmath142 at about 201  k ( [ min - rho ] ) not too far from the experimental value @xmath143",
    "g/@xmath142 at about @xmath144  k and atmospheric external pressure @xcite .",
    "although our simple quadratic extrapolation predicts a value for @xmath145 that is larger than the experimental , our data give an extrapolated @xmath146 at atmospheric pressure consistent with the results of the experiments @xcite and comparable to those from md simulations of tip5p - e water @xcite .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the experimental results for confined water are controversial @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the controversy is mainly about the experimental measurement of the effect , and not about the effect , because it has been observed that the existence of a density minimum in water is a necessary consequence of the existence of the low-@xmath1 branch of the tmd line @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been proposed that the locus of @xmath147 corresponds to saturation , or the maximal ordering , of a network of water molecules with a random tetrahedral local arrangement @xcite .",
    "our results , however , lead to a different explanation .",
    "we calculate the number of hbs @xmath148 in which a molecule participates , defined as @xmath149 from [ n_hb ] in such a way as to have four as maximum value for each molecule of the coarse - grained monolayer .",
    "first , we observe that our simulation results for the monolayer are consistent with experimental data for bulk water , with @xmath150 at @xmath151  gpa and @xmath152  k , and with @xmath153 at the lowest @xmath1 at about ambient @xmath2 , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( [ nhb ] ) .",
    "next , we find that for @xmath139  gpa the quantity reaches a maximum value of @xmath154 at temperatures that coincide , within error bars , with the temperatures @xmath146 of the density minima @xmath155 at the same pressure , and @xmath148 decreases to @xmath156 below @xmath146 . therefore , @xmath157 decreases and for [ vw ] the density increases .",
    "to understand why @xmath148 decreases below its maximum @xmath158 at low @xmath2 , we compare two cases corresponding to two different set of parameters of the model . the first as in [ phase - diagram ] , and the second , with @xmath136 and the other parameters unchanged , corresponding to the llcp and the sf scenario , respectively @xcite . by comparing the low-@xmath2 behavior of density for the two cases at intermediate @xmath1",
    ", we find that if @xmath136 , i.e. the hydrogen bond is not cooperative , then the density minima is undetectable within our resolution ( [ compare - rho - min ] ) .",
    "however , at lower @xmath1 we find that both sets of parameters give a detectable density minimum ( [ compare - low - p ] ) . therefore , the cooperative term of the hb interaction is not essential for the occurrence of the density minima , but it emphasizes the minima at intermediate pressures . from this observation",
    "we understand that the explanation proposed by poole at al .",
    "@xcite can be applied to the case with @xmath136 , in which the hb interaction does not include a cooperative ( many body ) term and the sf scenario is reproduced . in this case , the density increases for decreasing @xmath2 at very low @xmath2 , when all the possible hbs have been formed , generating regions of mismatching tetrahedral local order .",
    "a decrease of @xmath2 induces a small reduction of free volume per molecule , and a consequent small increase of density .",
    "instead , when @xmath159 , the cooperative interaction in [ coop ] induces the breaking of hbs for decreasing @xmath2 , to allow the reorientation of a molecule and a better matching of local tetrahedral order at low @xmath2 . as a consequence ,",
    "the number @xmath148 decreases from 3.75 to 3.5 inducing a large density increase .",
    "the high energy cost of this local rearrangement , i.e. the energy needed to break a hb , is at the origin of the high energy barrier for the process and the large increase of correlation time for the dynamics of the hb network in the vicinity of the locus of density minima .",
    "several authors relate the diffusion anomaly in water to the presence of defects in the network of hbs . here",
    "we show that the anomalous behavior of @xmath0 in the coarse - grained model is not related to the many - body component of the hb interaction and , therefore , to the possible occurrence of the llcp .",
    "the anomaly is , instead , due to the anticorrelation between volume and entropy , or to volume and energy , rooted to hb formation .",
    "we consider three different realizations of the coarse - grained model ( [ vh0 ] ) .",
    "the first corresponds to the case presented in the previous section , with the parameters as in [ phase - diagram ] . for the second",
    ", we set @xmath136 , leaving the other parameters unchanged .",
    "this case reproduces the sf scenario@xcite , where density maxima occur and which has been shown to correspond to the vanishing-@xmath2 limit of the llcp @xcite .",
    "our simulations show that the occurrence of the anomaly of @xmath0 is unaffected by this change of parameters ( [ vh0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the absence of cooperativity in the hb dynamics is not relevant for the occurrence of both density maxima and diffusion anomaly .",
    "this can be understood for the clear separation between the temperature range at which the anomaly of @xmath0 occurs and the temperature range at which water becomes subdiffusive .",
    "only the latter regime corresponds to the temperature range for which the cooperativity has a strong influence on the dynamics , while it has no major dynamic effect at higher @xmath2 .",
    "next , we set @xmath160 and leave the other parameters as in [ phase - diagram ]",
    ". this case would correspond to cooperatively bonding liquid with no density anomaly , i.e. with no anticorrelation between volume and entropy or volume and energy . in this case",
    "the change in the behavior of @xmath0 is striking ( [ vh0 ] ) .",
    "the system has no diffusion anomaly , with @xmath0 that decreases monotonically for increasing @xmath1 as in normal liquids .",
    "therefore , this result clarifies that the anomalous volume behavior due to the hb formation is directly related to the anomalous diffusion behavior .",
    "this conclusion , and the previous observation that the many - body component of the hb interaction is not relevant in determining these anomalies , leads us to investigate how the volume available for diffusion , and the number of hbs are related to @xmath0 , as discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we study by monte carlo simulations a coarse - grained model for a water monolayer confined between hydrophobic walls .",
    "we consider a separation between walls about @xmath8  nm that inhibits the formation of ice @xcite .",
    "the model includes isotropic , directional ( covalent ) and many - body ( cooperative ) components of the hbs . thanks to its coarse - graining",
    ", the model allows to study water in extreme conditions and , also , to check how each of the hb component affects its properties .",
    "moreover , it makes possible to perform mean field calculations to compare with simulations results .",
    "we find gas and liquid phases , separated by a boundary line of first ",
    "order phase transitions ending in a critical point occurring at higher pressure and temperature , consistent with other models for hydrophobically confined water @xcite .",
    "we study the diffusion constant parallel to the walls @xmath0 and find that it displays a line of maxima and a line of minima at constant @xmath2 , as seen in similar confinement for other models @xcite .",
    "our analysis allows us to conclude that the anomalous @xmath0 is a consequence of the anomalous volume behavior due to hb formation . in particular , the positive correlation between entropy and density , or energy and density , due to hydrogen bonding is the key element for the diffusion anomaly .",
    "it is worth reminding here that a similar result has been found also for potentials with isotropic interactions and water - like anomalies @xcite when the isothermal density dependence of the excess entropy , which is related to the total isothermal entropy by a linear function of the logarithm of the density , is considered .",
    "the difference with the present analysis is , nevertheless , threefold .",
    "first , for these isotropic potentials the hdl phase has less entropy than the ldl phase , implying a positive slope in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane for the liquid - liquid phase coexistence line as a consequence of the clausius - clapeyron equation . instead",
    ", for water and the present model the hdl phase has more entropy than the ldl phase , hence the liquid - liquid phase transition has a negative slope in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane .",
    "second , here we show that by setting the parameter that controls the increase of volume for hb formation , hence the positive correlation of density with entropy and energy , the anomalous diffusion behavior vanishes . instead , for the isotropic potentials the vanishing of the anomalous diffusion behavior",
    "is controlled by the softness of the soft - core repulsion of the potential @xcite .",
    "a direct relation between these two results is not straightforward and could be interesting to investigate .",
    "third , the present result does not exclude that the key element for diffusion anomaly is the positive correlation of density and energy , instead of entropy . while in water and the present model the ldl phase has lower energy and entropy than the hdl , in the isotropic potentials with water - like anomalies the ldl phase has lower energy but higher entropy than the hdl .",
    "these considerations support the idea that the mechanism of anomalies in isotropic potentials is different from that of water @xcite .",
    "interestingly , here we also observe that the lines of constant @xmath0 resemble the melting line of bulk water . at low temperatures",
    ", we find the locus of density maxima , which marks another well - known water anomaly .",
    "we discuss how this locus is related to the locus of expansivity minima .    at lower @xmath2",
    ", we find subdiffusive behavior @xmath126 , as seen in experiments of hydration water @xcite and simulations of confined water @xcite .",
    "our results are well described by @xmath127 , between 0.96 @xcite and @xmath129 @xcite of previous calculations .",
    "previous works proposed that subdiffusion is a consequence of the heterogeneities in water - interface interaction . here",
    "this rationale does not apply and we relate the subdiffusion to the increase of correlation among water molecules at low @xmath2 due to the full development of the hb network .    by further decreasing @xmath2 , we find density minima , as seen in experiments @xcite and md simulations @xcite .",
    "these minima occur within the subdiffusive part of the phase diagram , therefore where translational motion is strongly hampered and glassy behavior is incipient .",
    "nevertheless , the hb network within this region is still dynamically evolving , with increasing correlation time @xcite . in particular",
    ", the hb correlation time is about 4  ns for the majority of the subdiffusive region and increases , exceeding our simulation times of the order of @xmath161  ms , only at about @xmath162  gpa and @xmath163  k.    previous works related the density minima to the saturation of a network of molecules with a random tetrahedral local arrangement @xcite .",
    "however , this rationale apply to our model only for the case in which the cooperative component of the hydrogen bonds is zero . when the cooperative component is larger than zero ,",
    "as expected in real water @xcite , our calculations show that the minima are due to a reduction of the number of hbs , as a consequence of the reorientation of molecules for a better matching of local order .",
    "the high energy cost of this rearrangement is the cause of the large slowing down of the hb dynamics near the state points where the density minima occur .",

    "<S> we study , by monte carlo simulations , a coarse - grained model of a water monolayer between hydrophobic walls at partial hydration , with a wall - to - wall distance of about 0.5  nm . we analyze how the diffusion constant parallel to the walls , @xmath0 , changes and correlates to the phase diagram of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we find a locus of @xmath0 maxima and a locus of @xmath0 minima along isotherms , with lines of constant @xmath0 resembling the melting line of bulk water . </S>",
    "<S> the two loci of @xmath0 extrema envelope the line of temperatures of density maxima at constant @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show how these loci are related to the anomalous volume behavior due to the hydrogen bonds . at much lower @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> confined water becomes subdiffusive , and we discuss how this behavior is a consequence of the increased correlations among water molecules when the hydrogen bond network develops . within the subdiffusive region , although translations are largely hampered , we observe that the hydrogen bond network can equilibrate and its rearrangement is responsible for the appearance of density minima along isobars . </S>",
    "<S> we clarify that the minima are not necessarily related to the saturation of the hydrogen bond network . </S>"
