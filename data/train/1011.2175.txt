    "the weyl bivector operator was defined in a manner consistent with its boost weight decomposition .",

    ", the weyl operator can always be put into type i form by using a null rotation ( hence , @xmath280 ) . furthermore , the irreducible representations under the spins are : @xmath281 . utilizing the unused freedom of one spin , one boost and two null - rotations , in each of the algebraically special cases we can use these to simplify the weyl tensor even further .                ; consequently , the weyl operator @xmath145 has eigenvalues : _",
    "1,2=_3,4=-14(|r2ia_34 ) , _ 5,6=12(|r2ia_34 ) .",
    "we note that this is in agreement with the standard type * d * analysis in 4d ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the type * d * case is boost invariant , and also invariant under spins , consequently the isotropy is 2-dimensional .",
    "the two subcases @xmath284 and @xmath285 ( type * d*(a ) and * d*(b ) , respectively ) are in 4d referred to the purely `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' cases , respectively . in 4d , there is a duality relation , @xmath286 , which interchanges these two cases ; i.e. , @xmath287 interchanges the electic and magnetic parts .",
    "the 5d case is considerably more difficult than the 4d case .",
    "the complexity drastically increases and hence the number of special cases also increases .",
    "however , the 5d case is still managable and some simplifications occur ( compared to the general case ) .",
    "most notably , @xmath263 , and @xmath288 can be written , using a matrix @xmath289 , as follows ( similarly for @xmath290 ) : ^i _  jk=_jkl^li , where the conditions on @xmath291 imply that @xmath292 is symmetric and trace - free .",
    "therefore , we can use the spins to diagonalise @xmath292 .",
    "thus the general case is @xmath293 ( all eigenvalues different ) , with the special cases @xmath294 , @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",
    "furthermore , in the general case , the vector @xmath297 needs not be aligned with the eigenvectors of @xmath292 .",
    "there would consequently be special cases where @xmath297 is an eigenvector of @xmath292 .",
    "the components in 5d are displayed in table 1 . for type",
    "* d * we have that @xmath298 , and hence @xmath299 .",
    "the simplest of the three syzygies , the discriminant @xmath153 ( which is of 56th order in terms of @xmath302 , and contains 13377 terms ) is too lengthy to write down explicitly here ,   is given in @xcite . ] but it has the symbolic form : & = & ( _ s_6s_8_-_s_7_^2)_s_2_^21 + ( ) _ s_2_^20 + + & & + & & + + + + & & + & & + ( ) _ s_10_^4+(10 _ s_4 s_2 _ - 10 _ s_3_^2 - _ s_2_^3 ) _ s_10_^5 .",
