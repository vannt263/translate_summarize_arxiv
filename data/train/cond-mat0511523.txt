    "the issue of phase separation is currently one of the main topics of research in strongly correlated electron systems.@xcite phase separation ( ps ) fully develops in various manganese binary oxides , but there are also evidences of the key role played by clustered states in high tc superconductors.@xcite yet , after several years of intense experimental and theoretical research in this area , the true nature of the phase separated state observed in manganites is still controversial .",
    "some phenomenological models points to the strain between the coexisting phases as the main reason for the appearance of phase separated states.self,nature04 in addition , there is a lot of theoretical evidence in favor of the role of intrinsic disorder in the stabilization of the phase separated state .",
    "these models are based mainly in the double exchange theory , with a fundamental role played by electron - phonon coupling.khomskiieulet,motome,dagottoprb04 khomskii and co workers have also pointed out the tendency to ps of double exchange hamiltonians when elastic interactions are included.@xcite    the presence of quenched disorder can lead to a rough landscape of the free energy densities , triggering the formation of clustered states , which are induced by phase competition.@xcite moreo et al .",
    "obtained phase separated states in a monte - carlo simulation of a random - field ising model when disorder is included in the coupling and exchange interactions.moreoprl similar results were obtained by burgy and coworkers , using a uniform distribution of exchange interactions.@xcite as shown for the case of first order transitions , quenched impurities can lead , under certain circumstances , to a spread of local transition temperatures ( where local means over length scales of the order of the correlation length ) leading to the appearance of a clustered state with the consequent rounding of the first order transition.@xcite typical mechanisms to include disorder are chemical@xcite and structural.podzorov,controled    despite the intense effort towards a microscopic understanding of the manganites,@xcite many macroscopic features of the phase separated state , including its thermodynamic properties and dynamic behavior , still remains to be studied in greater detail .",
    "one of the most interesting features of the phase separated state is the entwining between its dynamic and static properties .",
    "some of the phase separated manganites display slow relaxation features that hide experimentally the real equilibrium thermodynamic state of the system.@xcite this is why the construction of phase diagrams is currently focused on the dynamic properties of the phase separated state , with regions of the phase diagrams nominated as frozen  or dynamic  ps,@xcite strain glass  or strain liquid@xcite  or , directly , ascribed as spin glass phases.@xcite    among the challenging issues that have not yet been addressed is an understanding of the phase separated state in terms of its thermodynamic properties .",
    "an analysis of the behavior of phase separated systems based on the probable free energies functional has been schematically realized , ueharaeulet , babush but without the corresponding measurements supporting the proposed scenario . in the present study we perform an attempt to construct the thermodynamic potentials of the fm and non - fm phases of a ps manganite , through calorimetric and magnetic measurements .",
    "the experiments were carried out in a polycrystalline sample of la@xmath4pr@xmath5ca@xmath6mno@xmath3 ( @xmath7 ) , a prototypical phase separated system in which the effects of the substitution of la by pr produces an overwhelming effect on its physical properties.@xcite we took advantage of the fact that in the mentioned compound homogeneous phases can be obtained at low temperatures in long time metastable states , which allow us to measure separately the specific heat of each phase , co or fm , in the low temperature region ( between 2k and 60k ) . with this data it is possible to write an expression for the difference between the gibbs energies of the homogeneous phases as a function of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the needed constants to link the thermodynamic potentials of both phases were obtained from indirect measurements based on the static and dynamic behavior of the system .",
    "the phase separated state is modeled through the hypothesis that the free energy densities are spread over the sample volume , and that its non - equilibrium features are governed by a hierarchical cooperative dynamic . within this framework",
    "it is possible to construct a phenomenological expression for the free energy of the phase separated state based on experimental data , which is able to describe consistently the behavior of the system as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field .",
    "the measurements were made on a polycrystalline sample of la@xmath0pr@xmath8ca@xmath9mno@xmath3 .",
    "details of material preparation were previously published.@xcite both magnetization and specific heat results were obtained with a quantum design ppms system .",
    "magnetization data was measured with an extraction magnetometer , as a function of temperature , applied magnetic field , and elapsed time .",
    "all temperature dependent data was measured with a cooling and warming rate of 0.8 k / min .",
    "specific heat data was measured with a relaxation method , between 2 and 60 k.",
    "following the @xmath10 phase diagram of the compound,@xcite after zero field cooling ( zfc ) the sample reaches the low temperature state mainly in the co phase , a state that has been described as frozen ps@xcite or strained glass@xcite this frozen state can be released by the application of a moderate magnetic field ( @xmath11=2.2t),@xcite above which the compound transforms into the fm phase in an abrupt metamagnetic transition.@xcite after this step transition the sample remains in this homogeneous fm state until a temperature around 70 k , even after the magnetic field is removed .",
    "these facts were used to perform the measurements of the specific heat @xmath12 of each phase ( @xmath13co or fm ) between 2k and 60k , each one considered as homogeneous in this temperature range under specific field conditions . in fig .",
    "1 the plot of @xmath14 vs @xmath15 is shown for measurements performed while warming after zfc with different procedures : under zero field ( co phase ) , and under different fields @xmath11 after a field sweep 0 - 9t-@xmath11 , for @xmath11=0 , 1 and 2 t ( fm phase ) .",
    "the data of the co phase and that of the fm are clearly distinguished .",
    "also , the results obtained for the fm phase for the fields employed are practically identical , which is a signature that the fm phase obtained after the application of 9 t remains homogeneous until the highest temperature investigated .",
    "besides , the fact that the specific heats of  the fm phase are almost independent of @xmath11 is a signal that , in the range of temperature investigated , there is no significant field dependent contribution to the entropy of the fm phase , indicating that the magnetization is saturated for all fields .",
    "the data obtained was adjusted using standard models for co and fm phases.@xcite the small upturn observed at low temperatures corresponds to the onset of the ordering of the magnetic momentum of the pr atoms.@xcite    the thermodynamic gibbs potential @xmath16 of each phase may be written as @xmath17 where the superscript @xmath18 indicates the phase ( co or fm ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the enthalpy and the entropy respectively . from the specific heat data we could construct both e and s in the usual way:@xcite @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the magnetization of the phase ( we assume @xmath23=0 for the co phase ) and",
    "@xmath24=2k is the lowest temperature reached in the measurements . as the specific heat of the fm phase",
    "was found almost independent of @xmath11 , we consider the zeeman term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) as the only dependence of the gibbs potentials of the fm phase with @xmath11 , so that @xmath25 . no dependence with @xmath11",
    "is considered for the co phase , since there is no way to perform the measurements on the co phase under an applied @xmath11 due to its instability against the application of @xmath11 in the temperature upturn .",
    "the terms @xmath26 and @xmath27  are respectively the values of the enthalpy and the entropy at the initial temperature @xmath24 . since we are interested in the energy difference between the phases involved , we have taken @xmath28 and @xmath29 as reference values , remaining @xmath30 and @xmath31as the constant to be determined .    in order to determine @xmath32 we followed the previously published experimental data in relation to the abrupt magnetic transition from the co to the fm phase , which happens at low temperatures ( below 6k ) , under a magnetic field of around 2.2 t [ ref .",
    "this transition is accompanied by a sudden increase of the sample temperature , which reaches a value around 30k after the transition . due to the velocity of the process ,",
    "it is plausible to consider that the enthalpy remains constant at the transition point , so that the following relation is fulfilled :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the magnetization of saturation of the fm phase ( @xmath34=3.67@xmath35 /mn=20.5 j / molt ) and @xmath11=2.2 t .",
    "this calculation yields @xmath36 , indicating that the homogeneous fm phase has lower free energy at low temperatures even for @xmath11=0 , as suggested in ref .",
    "dynamic .    in order to fully construct the thermodynamic potentials we have to determine the remaining constant @xmath31 which , at this point , is what controls the transition temperature between the homogeneous phases , providing it is a positive quantity as expected for the difference of entropy between the fm and co phases due to the excess of configurational entropy of the latter.@xcite in fig .",
    "2 the obtained thermodynamic potentials of the homogeneous phases are displayed , assuming a value @xmath37 , this value was obtained by adjusting the @xmath38 curve of fig .",
    "4b , as explained below .",
    "the plot indicates that the homogeneous fm state has a lower energy than the co state for all fields at low temperatures , while the co phase is the stable state at high temperatures , with field - dependent transition temperatures ranging from 30k for @xmath11=0 to 60k for @xmath11=2 t .",
    "the above presented results give us an insight on the behavior of the system under the hypothesis that no phase separation occurs , i.e. , describes the thermodynamics of the homogeneous equilibrium phases .",
    "in addition , in order to obtain a phase separated state from the thermodynamic data an appropriate modelling needs to include a priori the existence of the phase separated state .",
    "however , one needs to be careful when comparing the predictions of the model with experimental results .",
    "it is well established dynamic , reentrant that the phase separated state is characterized by a slow dynamics , which implies that equilibrium is hardly reached in laboratory times .",
    "the equilibrium properties must be linked with the measured data and therefore a dynamic treatment is needed .    in the discussion that follows we perform a qualitative analysis within a framework where both static and dynamic properties are treated on a phenomenological basis .",
    "it is well known that the physical properties of the lpcmo system changes dramatically near @xmath39=0.32 , @xcite revealing the extreme sensitivity of the system to small variations in the mean atomic radius of the perovskite a - site .",
    "this can be due to the effects that quenched disorder introduced by chemical substitution has on the local properties , @xcite or else to the role played by `` martensitic - type '' accommodation strains originated by the volume differences between the fm and co unit cells .",
    "@xcite on one hand , the inclusion of disorder in a random - field ising model leads to a spatially inhomogeneous transition temperature , from the paramagnetic disordered phase to the `` ordered '' phase , characterized by the appearance of clustered states.burgy01,aliaga this fact implies a spatial dependence of the quadratic coefficient in a landau - type expansion .",
    "on the other hand , strain induced by the shape - constrained transformation between the co and the fm phases could lead to the phase separated state through the frustration of long - range interactions .",
    "@xcite in the latter view , the properties of a specific compound are governed by an `` effective '' pr concentration , which controls the capability of the system to accommodate the anisotropic strain.@xcite these two alternative pictures are not mutually exclusive ; the clustered states induced by disorder are enhanced if correlated disorder is included in the model,@xcite a feature that mimics the cooperative effects of the jahn - teller distortion , in a similar way as elastic interactions are able to induce long scale phase separation in phenomenological models @xcite ( in this last case a renormalized fourth order term is the responsible for the introduction of spatial inhomogeneities ) . additionally , local variations of the atomic composition can couple with the anisotropic strain triggering the formation of the phase separated state.@xcite    these facts can be qualitatively described introducing non - uniform free energy densities for the co and fm phases .",
    "the simplest form is a uniform distribution of these densities over the sample volume , with mean values equal to the free energy of the homogeneous phases . within the hypothesis that precursor effects of phase separation are due to variations of the local composition",
    ", we follow imry and wortis theory @xcite describing the effects of disorder on a system displaying a first order transition in order to estimate the width of the free energies distributions .",
    "following their ideas , and considering that disorder affects mainly the free energy density of the fm phase , ( @xmath40 is nearly constant as a function of pr content @xmath39 [ ref . @xcite ] ) we can write an expression for the local free energy density @xmath41 depending on the fluctuations of composition @xmath42 .    @xmath43    where @xmath42 is taken over length scales comparables with the correlation length , which is around 1 nm for microscopic clusters in pr@xmath44ca@xmath45mno@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite with the gaussian distribution proposed in ref @xcite @xmath42 can be as high as 0.1 over nanometer length scales ; the development of micrometer sized domains would need of the consideration of elastic interactions .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we take a uniform distribution for @xmath42 over the sample volume . with these assumptions ,",
    "the free energy density of the fm phase as a function of @xmath46 ( the volume coordinate is normalized to 1 ) is written as :    @xmath47    where @xmath48  is the parameter controlling the width of the free energy functional , which can be estimated from eq .",
    "( 4 ) as @xmath49 , taking into account that @xmath50 [ ref.@xcite ] and assuming @xmath51 in this way , the equilibrium fm fraction @xmath52 at the given @xmath53 and @xmath11 is obtained as :    @xmath54    this expression could be used for determining the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 , using for instance the @xmath57 data at different temperatures . however , as stated before , the global behavior of the system at low temperatures is characterized by out - of - equilibrium features , so the true values for @xmath52 are not easily accessible experimentally .    in order to circumvent the fact that the thermodynamic equilibrium state is not reached experimentally , an alternative approach is to consider that the response of the system within the phase separated regime as a function of temperature can be qualitatively described within a model of cooperative hierarchical dynamics , using an activated functional form with state - dependent energy barriers.@xcite the time evolution of the fm fraction @xmath46 is given by :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 represents a fixed relaxation rate and @xmath60 is a ( field dependent ) energy barrier scale .",
    "this model is similar to that employed to describe vortex dynamics in high @xmath61 superconductors@xcite and is based in dynamic scaling for systems with logarithmic relaxations.labarta the inbreeding between the dynamic behavior and the equilibrium state of the system is given by the functional form of the effective energy barriers @xmath62 , which diverge as the system approaches equilibrium .",
    "this fact represents the main difference with respect to a pure superparamagnetic behavior , and predicts the existence of state - depending blocking temperatures @xmath63 at which , for any given fm fraction @xmath64 , the system becomes blocked , in the sense that the velocity of change of the fm fraction is lower than , for instance , the detectable velocity @xmath65 , estimated as @xmath66 10@xmath67 for a conventional data measurement that takes 30 sec.@xcite .",
    "this gives the following relation for @xmath63 :    @xmath68    through eq .",
    "( 8) it is possible to obtain an experimental estimation of the factor @xmath69 which governs the interplay between the dynamics of the system and the measurement procedure .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath57 data for selected temperatures , and the experimentally obtained values of @xmath70  as a function of @xmath11 , determined through low temperatures measurements between 6 and 32 k. the values of @xmath11 are those at which the system reaches the state with @xmath71 .",
    "the main assumption is that each point of the @xmath57 curve corresponds to a blocked state compatible with the measurement procedure . as indicated in the inset of figure 3 the relation @xmath72 holds , with @xmath73 .",
    "we will show later that the equilibrium state at low temperatures is fully fm , so eq . ( 8) is a direct measurement of the field dependence of the factor @xmath74 . within the dynamic model adopted ,",
    "this factor is independent of the particular value of @xmath75 choosen for its determination . with the assumption that this relation holds in the whole temperature range where phase separation occurs , we can write a simple equation relating the equilibrium state with the experimentally accessible state    @xmath76    through this equation it is possible to make the link between the equilibrium state of the system , which can be obtained through the free energies functional , and the experimental data obtained through both @xmath57 and @xmath77 measurements .    the upper panel of fig .",

    "it shows that , with the set of parameters employed , the low temperature state of the system is fully fm for moderate fields . however , the accessible fm fraction after a zfc procedure is small for @xmath11 @xmath79 2 t , due to the weight of the blocking term in eq .",
    "this is why , besides the fact that the difference between the free energies of the co and the fm states increases as temperature is lowered , the magnetic field needed to induce the co - fm transition also increases , a fact that at first sight could be interpreted as a reentrance of the co state . as the temperature is raised above 25k the influence of the blocking term decreases ; in this temperature region the main factor determining the field needed to induce de co - fm transition lies in the field dependence of the equilibrium fraction .",

    "the stable state of the system is homogeneous fm for all fields needed to induce the growth of the fm phase to a value @xmath83 ; the presence of the co phase is only explained by the slow growing of the fm phase against the unstable co due to the energy barriers . in the dynamic ps regime , the influence of the blocking term diminished , the equilibrium state is true ps for moderate fields , and the effect of @xmath11 is mainly to unbalance the amount of the coexisting phases .",

    "each of these regions is in turn divided in two other , labeled @xmath86 @xmath87 or @xmath88 @xmath89 , indicating that if the system is in a state within this region is able to evolve toward equilibrium within the measurement time .",
    "the regions labeled as @xmath90 indicate that the system is blocked , and no evolution is expected within the time window of the experiment .",

    "the data extracted from the @xmath57 measurements gives information on the @xmath46 values for which the system becomes blocked at each temperature , for the specific field and for the characteristic measuring time , indicating the frontier between the dynamic and frozen fm regions .",

    "is increased , the system gets into a region for which @xmath94 with a fm fraction greater than the lower limit for @xmath75 , so it remains blocked without changes in the magnetic response , a fact characterized by the plateau observed in @xmath77 for the high temperature region .",
    "this non - equilibrium phase diagram was constructed for the particular measurement procedure employed for the acquisition of @xmath57 and @xmath77 data . a modification in this procedure ( for instance , by changing the time spend at each measured point ) will result in a change in the factor @xmath65 , with the consequent change of the boundaries in the phase diagram .",
    "for example , the effect of increasing the measured time by one order of magnitude is shown by dashed lines in the phase diagram of fig .",

    "the dashed lines show the new phase diagram boundaries if the measuring time is increased by one order of magnitude . ]",
    "in conclusion , we presented a thermodynamic phenomenological model for a global description of the phase separated state of manganites .",
    "the construction starts with the calculation of the free energies of the homogeneous fm and co phases .",
    "the free energies obtained turned out to be very close in value : the difference was of the order of the magnetic energy for intermediate fields in the whole temperature range investigated .",
    "the phase separated state is introduced by considering a uniform spread of the free energy density of the fm phase , and the dynamic behavior is included within a scenario in which the evolution of the system is determined through a cooperative hierarchical dynamic with diverging energy barriers as the system approaches equilibrium .",
    "the main success of the model is to provide an understanding of the response of the phase separated state when both temperature and magnetic field are varied , being able to reproduce the dynamic and static properties of the system under study .",
    "the same methodology can be also applied to other compounds sharing similar phase diagrams @xcite and properties , especially those displaying abrupt field induced transitions at low temperatures.schiffer,fisher,rana the key factors to determine the free energies of the homogeneous phases is the possibility to measure the specific heat of each phase separately , taking advantage of the existence of blocked states , and the measurement of the temperature reached by the compound under study after the co - fm abrupt transition at low temperature .",
    "this last value and the field at which the abrupt transition occurs are the key parameters to determine the homogeneous ground state of the system at zero applied field ."
