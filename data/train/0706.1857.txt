    "the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on board hinode @xcite takes high resolution spectra in the two wavelength bands 170211    and 246292   , referred to here as the short and long wavelength bands ( sw and lw , respectively ) .",
    "the instrument is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the two wavelength bands were chosen as they contain excellent diagnostics of coronal and flaring plasma ; the sw band in particular is the most rich in coronal plasma diagnostics in the whole euv region , and eis is the first satellite - based instrument to observe it in high resolution .",
    "constraints due to on board storage and telemetry mean that for eis observations with a reasonable cadence and spatial coverage it is not possible to send the complete spectra to earth .",
    "an on board selection of particular emission lines is thus performed , the reduced telemetry consisting of a set of windows @xmath0 pixels wide by @xmath1 pixels high centred on each of the selected wavelengths .",
    "the most important aspect of designing an eis observation study is to choose the emission lines for the science you want to do .",
    "the present paper provides a guide to the most prominent and useful emission lines in the eis spectra based on early data analysis , and also highlights key density diagnostics .",
    "pre - flight descriptions of the eis capabilities , including diagnostics and line identifications , are given in @xcite .",
    "the eis instrument is performing very well in terms of expected sensitivity and spectral resolution , and the observed spectra are very similar to pre - flight predictions made by @xcite using the chianti database @xcite and the expected instrument parameters . figs .",
    "[ fig.quiet ] and [ fig.active ] show sample averaged spectra obtained with eis for quiet and active regions observed on 2006 december 23 16:10  ut and 2006 november 4 11:49  ut , respectively .",
    "the 1@xmath2 slit was used in each case .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the emission lines is around 0.0650.075  (33.5 pixels ) , corresponding to a spectral resolution of @xmath3  30004,000 .",
    "a key factor when judging the usefulness of an eis emission line is the telescope effective area ( ea ) at that wavelength , which determines the fraction of incident photons that arrive at the detector .",
    "the ea curves are overplotted as dashed lines on the spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig.quiet ] and [ fig.active ] .",
    "the use of two different multilayer coatings on the eis optical surfaces leads to ea curves that are peaked for the two channels , with less sensitivity at the ends of each wavelength range .",
    "this is particularly so for the sw channel which peaks at 196   , very close to the strong @xmath4195.12 line of , making this the strongest line observed by eis in most conditions .",
    "the @xmath4171.02 and @xmath4174.53 lines are comparable in strength to @xmath4195.12 in moderately active solar conditions @xcite , but when observed with eis they are factors 1000 and 200 times weaker than @xmath4195.12 , respectively . the ea curve for the long wavelength ( lw ) band is less peaked giving a more consistent instrument sensitivity across the band .",
    "the shape of these ea curves is an important consideration when choosing emission lines for eis observation studies : a weak line near 195    can yield more instrument counts than a stronger line at the edges of the ea curve .",
    "specific examples of this are discussed below .",
    "another important factor when considering emission lines is the degree of blending . even with the high spectral resolution of eis , many lines are blended with other species , particularly in the sw channel .",
    "examples of such blends are described below and include the blending of two of the three eis ` core lines '  @xmath4256.32 and @xmath4192.82  which are lines included by default in all eis observation studies . in many cases",
    "the contributions of blending lines can be estimated quite accurately by making use of line ratios that are insensitive to the plasma conditions and again examples are given below .",
    "the ions discussed in the following sections we believe will be sufficient for most science studies . however , there are a number of interesting lines from ions of nickel , sulphur , argon and calcium that will be valuable for abundance or flare studies .",
    "discussion of these lines will be deferred to a future paper .",
    "all atomic data used in compiling this paper are from v.5.2 of the chianti atomic database @xcite and , in particular , all wavelengths given below are from chianti . when referring to intensity ratios below , ratios in energy units ( rather than photon units ) are implied .",
    "when referring to the strength of eis lines , we usually use the measure `` data number '' ( dn ) , which is the unit for the data stored in the level 0 eis fits files .",
    "the number of photons is obtained by multiplying the dn by a wavelength varying factor of around 23 . due to space restrictions",
    ", we can not give the transition identifications for all the lines in the current document .",
    "for these we refer the reader to @xcite or the chianti database .",

    "our recommended prescription for estimating the contribution to the line is thus to measure the @xmath4188.23 line and multiply the intensity by the factor 0.26 to obtain the @xmath4192.83 intensity .    despite the difficulties with blending it",
    "should be noted that completely dominates the other lines in large flares and thus is an important line for such observations .",

    "the recommended density diagnostics described in the text are summarised in fig .  [ fig.dens ] .",
    "the data rate for eis is sufficiently high that 1020 wavelength windows can be chosen in most cases and thus many of the recommended lines can be selected . for density diagnostics ,",
    "we recommend the @xmath4196.64/@xmath4195.12 , and @xmath4196.54/@xmath4202.04 and @xmath4203.82/@xmath4202.04 ratios for all studies .",
    "for the other diagnostics an assessment should be made based on the science to be achieved ( e.g. , for transition region brightenings in active regions the and ratios should be selected ) .",
    "the eis planning software allows spectral windows to have variable sizes which can be used to select windows that span more than one emission line .",
    "this is useful for lines that are close in wavelength ( e.g. , @xmath4194.66 and @xmath4195.12 ) and for cases where a large window is required to yield a good background measurement ( e.g. , @xmath4257.26 ) .",
    "although the eis emission lines typically extend over 12 wavelength pixels we recommend setting the widths of wavelength windows to be 32 or 40 pixels ( window sizes have to be multiples of 8 pixels ) as the emission lines have been seen to broaden significantly in flares and other dynamic phenomena .",
    "broad windows also allow the background level in the spectra to be more accurately measured .",
    "if high cadence is required , then using 24 pixels to reduce the data rate is acceptable , but high velocity events may be missed . for @xmath4195.12 a window size of 48 pixels ( or larger ) is recommended as the instrument is so sensitive at this wavelength .",
    "the choice of exposure time for eis studies depends on both the target and science objective .",
    "if good signal is required in a wide range of lines , then exposure times of 6090  s for quiet sun and 2040  s for active regions are recommended .",
    "if higher cadence is required , then good signal in the strong lines ( including the recommended and density diagnostics ) can be obtained in 20  s for quiet sun and 5  s for active regions .",
    "exposure times down to 1  s will give a good signal in the @xmath4195.12 line in active regions .",
    "these exposure times are for the 1@xmath30 slit  they should be reduced by a factor 2 for the 2@xmath30 slit , and about a factor 2.5 for the slots .",
    "the quality of the eis spectra are outstanding and reveal a large number of emission lines throughout the two wavelength bands that offer exciting diagnostic opportunities , a number of which are exploited in papers in this volume of pasj .",
    "the present work has summarised some of the key emission lines and density diagnostics based on evaluations of the initial eis data - sets using the chianti atomic database .",
