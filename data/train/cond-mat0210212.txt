    "in a previous work  @xcite , we examined packings formed by spheres growing in @xmath0 dimensions , immediately stopping upon contact with another sphere .",
    "we termed this to be packing - limited growth ( plg ) . here",
    ", we address the question of what happens when we consider irregular ( i.e. , non - spherical ) objects of similar shape growing in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "we focus in particular on collisions of growing rectangles . by combining rectangles , we are able to form and examine a range of shapes whose growth patterns vary broadly in radial anisotropy .",
    "whereas in  @xcite we found universality classes depending only on dimension @xmath0 , we find here that marked non - universal behavior arises when shapes are varied .",
    "our problem finds several motivations .",
    "first , this is a relatively unexplored kind of packing .",
    "packings are generally static or randomly generated  @xcite : physical mechanisms are only seldomly connected with the creation of packings  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , packings are typically of monodisperse objects of the same form or taken from a small set of forms  @xcite . from a physical point of view , two - dimensional packings of growing objects may be of use in modeling or understanding certain biological and ecological patterns .",
    "we consider the geometric approach presented here as a preliminary step towards describing how shape alters the size distributions of populations .    in section  [ irregular.objects ]",
    "we describe the various objects we construct from rectangles .",
    "although not all of these objects have obvious physical parallels , they present a range of typological cases from which direct applications and comparisons may be sought . in section  [ irregular.theory ] , we provide a scaling analysis that empirically appears to be exact for @xmath2 in the case of hyperspheres  @xcite ( details of the calculations for this section are given in appendix  [ appendix : irregular.alphamf ] ) .",
    "we report the results of our numerical investigations in section  [ irregular.numerics ] along with a discussion of the failings of the scaling theory .",
    "we conclude the paper in section  [ irregular.conclusion ] and outline our algorithm for packing rectangles in appendix  [ appendix : irregular.rectcalcs ] .",
    "the building block shape of the objects we consider is the rectangle .",
    "we denote the aspect ratio as @xmath3 , defining all rectangles such that @xmath4 .",
    "we record rectangle size @xmath5 as half the length of the long side , the dimensions then being @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "examples of each object are provided in the packings of figures  [ fig : irregular.rectsn1000comb ] and  [ fig : irregular.crossesn1000comb ] .    for @xmath8 , we have squares and as @xmath9 , rectangles effectively become line segments and the packing becomes one of fitting @xmath10 objects into a @xmath1 volume .",
    "rectangles afford a basic example of anisotropic growth since the long side grows at a rate slower than the short side by a factor of @xmath11 .",
    "the growing square is distinguished from the rectangle since the former expands uniformly perpendicular to its edges .",
    "however , in comparison to disks , the growth rate of edge points relative to the center of both squares and rectangles is non - uniform .",
    "the simplest combination of two rectangles is a cross ( figures  [ fig : irregular.crossesn1000comb]a and  [ fig : irregular.crossesn1000comb]b ) and a natural generalization is the @xmath12-spoke object ( with @xmath13 being a rectangle and @xmath14 being a cross , see figure  [ fig : irregular.crossesn1000comb]c ) .",
    "each @xmath12-spoke object is then part of a family of shapes indexed by @xmath3 .",
    "the last object we consider is an eight - pointed star as shown in figure  [ fig : irregular.crossesn1000comb]d .",
    "this object is formed by two squares overlaid at angle of @xmath15 to each other .",
    "all objects are packed using the approach of manna  @xcite : objects are added sequentially and allowed to instantly grow so as to just reach the existing packing structure .",
    "we have observed and argued  @xcite that the value of the size distribution exponent and all other related exponents is independent of the growth dynamic .    in the context of packing , spheres make for straightforward calculations since the contact point between any two colliding spheres occurs along the line through their centers .",
    "rectangles constitute a relatively simple generalization of spheres from a numerical point of view , hence our use of them here .",
    "in  @xcite , we argued that a simple scaling assumption may be made regarding the form of @xmath16 , the distribution of sphere sizes after @xmath17 objects have been packed .",
    "we take @xmath16 to be described by a power law for radii above a cutoff value @xmath18 and uniform below : @xmath19 the tail of the distribution is fixed and the distribution fills in ( @xmath18 decreases with @xmath17 ) with the @xmath20th object being chosen from within the pore space .",
    "the size distribution @xmath16 is connected to the probability of inserting an object of size @xmath5 after @xmath17 objects have been deposited , @xmath21 . since the probability of adding",
    "a sphere of vanishing radii must be proportional to the total surface area of the existing spheres @xmath22 , we were able to estimate @xmath21 as  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pore space volume .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : irregular.prn ] ) to calculate @xmath22 and @xmath24 and requiring that @xmath21 be normalized , we obtained the estimate @xmath25 for disks .",
    "more generally in @xmath1 dimensions , if we now write area as @xmath26 and perimeter as @xmath27 , we find the scaling exponent to be @xmath28 setting @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we recover @xmath25 for disks . note that the probability of adding a non - spherical object is still proportional to @xmath22 in the limit of @xmath31 , regardless of the object s shape .",
    "for example , it is irrelevant that an added square of side length @xmath6 may be oriented such that its center is between @xmath5 and @xmath32 away from its point of contact with the existing packing .",
    "also note that as @xmath33 , the theoretical prediction tends to @xmath34 , in agreement with a previous determination of an upper bound for polydisperse packings  @xcite .",
    "details of the calculations finding @xmath35 for the objects we consider here are to be found in appendix [ appendix : irregular.alphamf ] .",
    "all other exponents depend on @xmath36 via simple scaling relations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the pore volume @xmath24 decays as @xmath37 with the connection between @xmath38 and @xmath36 being @xmath39 we use this equation to calculate theoretical estimates of @xmath38 , denoting them by @xmath40 . since",
    "direct measurement of @xmath38 is a significantly more robust exercise than determining @xmath36 from @xmath41 , we employ equation  ( [ eq : irregular.alphabeta ] ) in estimating @xmath36 in the following section .",

    "some example distributions taken from rectangle packings for @xmath8 , 10 , and 100 are shown in figure  [ fig : irregular.rectsphi ] .",
    "the distribution @xmath50 is the unnormalized frequency distribution corresponding to @xmath41 . in the case of plain rectangles , we see that as @xmath3 increases , both the observed @xmath36 and the theoretical estimate @xmath35 increase while @xmath38 and @xmath40 accordingly decrease . furthermore , for all the shapes considered we find that @xmath51 for all finite @xmath3 .",
    "we note that measuring power law exponents is not a trivial procedure and here we take some care to ensure the validity of our results . while simple regression is the basic tool of analysis , the presence of , for example , crossovers and finite size cutoffs can substantially degrade the level of precision attainable .",
    "the method of measuring exponents we use here is based on examining a smoothed version of the derivative of the distribution as viewed in double logarithmic space ( similar approaches are to be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath24 , we perform regression analysis on @xmath52 versus @xmath53 over a sliding , variable width window of values of @xmath53 . writing the upper and lower limits of this window as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 being the width . in general , depending on the number of orders of magnitude spanned by the data",
    ", we would preferably choose @xmath57 in the range @xmath58 .",
    "here , we fix @xmath59 and calculate the `` local '' exponent @xmath60 for each window .",
    "we find in all cases that @xmath60 tends towards a constant value .",
    "this indicates the scaling law is robust and further allows us to estimate @xmath38 along with an error based on the fluctuations observed for @xmath60 .",
    "measured values of @xmath36 and @xmath38 are recorded in table  [ tab : irregular.alpha_results ] .    as we have noted above",
    ", our scaling theory approach appears to be exact for @xmath61 dimensions in the case of hyperspheres and an overestimate of the true value of @xmath36 for @xmath62 .",
    "we therefore do not expect the scaling theory to be correct for non - spherical objects in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "indeed , in all cases , we observe the theoretical estimate @xmath35 is an overestimate of the measured @xmath36 .",
    "this direction of error makes sense in light of the scaling assumption made by equation  ( [ eq : irregular.pins ] ) .",
    "the actual form of @xmath21 is not precisely uniform but rather rolls over less steeply than a step function around @xmath63 . given the manipulations that leads to  ( [ eq : irregular.alphamf ] ) , it can be argued that @xmath64 must hold  @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : irregular.alphavals ] , we show how @xmath36 varies as a function of both aspect ratio @xmath3 of the constituent rectangles and the object s particular shape .",
    "the strongest influence is evidently aspect ratio with @xmath36 varying from @xmath65 ( disks , @xmath8 ) up to @xmath66 ( rectangles , @xmath17-spokes , @xmath67 ) .",
    "we observe a secondary effect due to the details of the shape .",
    "square and the eight - pointed star packings have a value of @xmath36 increased above that of disks .",
    "cross packings have a higher value of @xmath36 than do rectangles with the same aspect ratio .",
    "we have extended a model describing the interaction of growing disks  @xcite to the problem of growing irregular and anisotropic objects . in this model , the exponent characterizing the size distribution of objects is found to be independent of growth dynamics .",
    "however , the main result presented here is that the exponent is highly shape - dependent , adopting a continuous range of values @xmath68 . ultimately , understanding how geometry impacts on the structure of plant communities will require imposing a notion of packing - limited growth onto a reasonable set of dynamics .",
    "the results here demonstrate that in so doing we must keep in mind that shape matters .",
