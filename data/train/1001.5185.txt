    "the interest on quantum entanglement has dramatically increased during the last two decades due to the emerging field of quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "it turns out that quantum entanglement may be used as basic resources in quantum information processing and communication .",
    "the prominent examples are quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation , quantum error correction codes and quantum computation . hence it is of basic importance from both experimental and theoretical point of view to provide methods of detecting and quantifying entanglement @xcite .",
    "there are no universal criteria to detect quantum entanglement and there are few measures of entanglement ( based on the notion of entropy @xcite , entanglement of formation @xcite , concurrence @xcite , robustness @xcite , geometrical measures @xcite and others ) .",
    "they can be calculated for pure quantum states or for the very limited class of mixed states possessing some symmetry properties @xcite .",
    "therefore , the great effort is directed to obtain methods of estimation of particular entanglement measures and to find relations between them @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "what is measured in an experiment it is an expectation value of some observables , hence the estimations based on such quantities are most welcome @xcite .",
    "for example , it was recently shown @xcite that the concurrence for pure bipartite state @xmath0 living in a hilbert space @xmath1 can be obtained as follows @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the projector onto the symmetric subspace of @xmath1 , i.e. , concurrence is expressible by the mean value of the observable @xmath5 acting on the two - copy space @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that useful candidates for this purpose are entanglement witnesses @xcite ( see @xcite for the recent review on entanglement witnesses ) .",
    "we shown that each entanglement witness detecting given bipartite entangled state in @xmath7 provides an estimation of its concurrence .",
    "hence , ews define a universal tool not only for detecting quantum entanglement but also for estimating its measure .",
    "we compare estimation based on entanglement witnesses with other ones provided by the trace norm of partial transposition and realignment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we provide basic introduction to concurrence and its estimations .",
    "section [ main ] presents our main result which is illustrated by the family of examples in section [ ex ] .",
    "final conclusions are collected in the last section .",
    "let us recall that the concurrence for a pure bipartite state @xmath8 is defined as follows @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the reduced density matrix . in the following , we will use a schmidt decomposition of the pure state @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are orthonormal bases in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the schmidt coefficients @xmath17 and satisfy the following normalization condition @xmath18 it is easy to check that concurrence @xmath19 is uniquely defined in terms of the schmidt coefficients @xmath20 .",
    "one has @xmath21 for a mixed state @xmath22 the concurrence is defined via a convex roof construction @xmath23 it is well known @xcite that for a two - qubit case one finds the following formula for the concurrence of the arbitrary mixed state @xmath24 where @xmath25 are singular values of a matrix @xmath26 with @xmath27 denoting eigenvectors of @xmath28 and @xmath29 stands for the pauli matrix . in general , however , one has only the following estimation @xcite @xmath30 where now @xmath31 are singular values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are generators of the so@xmath35 group .",
    "it is also possible to carry out the optimalisation procedure involved in ( [ mixed - state - conc ] ) for particular families of states possessing some symmetry properties ( werner states , isotropic states ) @xcite .",
    "let us recall two basic results which enable estimation of concurrence for an arbitrary entangled mixed state @xmath28 .",
    "the following estimation is valid : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the trace norm of @xmath38 .    as usual",
    "@xmath39 denotes a partial transposition of @xmath28 and @xmath40 stands for the realigned matrix @xcite . for some generalizations",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that although for a ppt state @xmath41 , the norm of a realigned matrix @xmath42 can still be greater than 1 resulting in a nontrivial estimation .",
    "let us recall that a hermitian operator @xmath43 is called an entanglement witness for a state @xmath28 , if @xmath44 while @xmath45 for all separable states @xmath46 .",
    "there are many examples @xcite of entanglement measures @xmath47 ( concurrence , negativity , robustness , etc . ) which can be related to the expectation value of some entanglement witness @xmath48 where the set @xmath49 depends on the measure @xmath50 in question .",
    "it is therefore clear that if @xmath43 is an entanglement witness for @xmath28 , i.e.  @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , then one finds the following estimation @xmath53 for the measure of entanglement of @xmath28 . in the case of concurrence one has the following theorem    [ t - b ] let @xmath43 be an entanglement witness such that @xmath54 for every pure state ( [ schm - decomp ] ) .",
    "then for an arbitrary mixed state @xmath28 detected by the witness @xmath43 @xmath55",
    "theorem [ t - b ] distinguishes a class of witnesses satisfying condition ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "suppose now that @xmath43 does not satisfy this condition .",
    "clearly , for any @xmath56 the rescaled operator @xmath57 still defines an ew .",
    "does @xmath57 satisfy ( [ cond ] ) ? to answer this question let us observe that for @xmath58 the expectation value of @xmath43 reads as follows @xmath59 where the @xmath60-dependent matrix @xmath61 is defined by @xmath62 note , that @xmath63 by the very definition of entanglement witness .",
    "it is clear that @xmath64 encodes the entire information about @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the condition ( [ cond ] ) is equivalent to @xmath65 let us observe that the space of normalized vectors defines a compact set and hence one may define a positive number @xmath66 by the following procedure @xmath67 now , comes the main result    [ t - m ] for any @xmath68 the rescaled entanglement witness @xmath57 does satisfy ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "the proof is almost trivial .",
    "one has @xmath69 where we have used ( [ kk ] ) .",
    "hence , if @xmath70 for every normalized @xmath60 , then @xmath43 does satisfy ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "suppose now that the above condition is not satisfied .",
    "it is therefore clear that for the rescaled witness @xmath71 with @xmath68 , one has @xmath72 which proves our theorem .",
    "it should be stressed that the best estimation is provided by the witness corresponding to @xmath73 .",
    "_ let @xmath74 and consider the flip operator @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the computional basis in @xmath77 .",
    "simple calculation gives @xmath78 now , evidently @xmath79 and for @xmath80 @xmath81 according to orthonormality of both basis .",
    "_    let us consider isotropic states in @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the maximally entangled state and @xmath85 is the fidelity defined by @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , one introduces a family of @xmath87-ews @xcite @xmath88 satisfying @xmath89=\\frac{k}{m}-f\\,,\\ ] ] that is , @xmath90 detects isotropic state with fidelity @xmath91 .",
    "such state has schmidt number strictly greater than @xmath87 . since @xmath92",
    "the previous example implies for @xmath93 @xmath94 which shows that @xmath95 . as a consequence , the optimal @xmath96 , in the sense of ( [ optimal ] ) , is @xmath97 .",
    "now , @xmath98 and the estimation ( [ witness - condition ] ) takes the form @xmath99 note that although for @xmath100 , @xmath90 provides only the bound for concurrence , when @xmath101 , we obtain an _ exact _ result @xcite .",
    "let us note that a much more general ( but also numerically more involved ) method of estimating various entanglement measures was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the method uses a concept of an entanglement witness and on the other hand provides a numerical procedure to calculate the legendre transform of the measure in question .",
    "the method provided in this paper is much more restricted . however , being simpler it provides estimation of concurrence which can be very often computed analytically .",
    "the above examples show that it can leads not only to upper bounds for concurrence but also to exact results .",
    "_ in @xcite we have investigated an @xmath102-family ( @xmath103 ) of states in @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes a maximally entangled state , @xmath107 and the normalization factor @xmath108 it turns out that @xmath109 is entangled if and only if @xmath110 .",
