    "the distance to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is a fundamental step in the cosmological distance ladder , since the extragalactic distance scale is usually determined with respect to the lmc distance .",
    "in fact , both the hst @xmath4 key project ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1995 , freedman et al . 1999 ) and the supernovae calibration team ( saha et al .",
    "1999 ) fix the zero - point of the cosmological distance scale assuming a de - reddened lmc distance modulus ( dm ) of 18.50 ; in the case of the hst @xmath4 key project the adopted uncertainty of @xmath3 0.13 on the lmc distance modulus represents the largest contribution to their systematic error budget .    in recent years",
    "various methods have yielded lmc distance moduli showing a remarkable spread , ranging from dm = 18.07 ( udalski et al .",
    "1998a ) to dm = 18.70 ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) ",
    "see for example the review by gibson ( 1999 ) or feast ( 2001 ) .",
    "this uncertainty alone on the lmc distance causes an indetermination by @xmath520% on the value of the hubble constant .",
    "a method that , at present , seems to support the short distance scale , involves the analysis of the light - curve , radial velocity curve and uv / optical spectrum of the detached eclipsing binary hv 2274 in the lmc .",
    "it is considered ( see , e.g. , gibson 1999 ) to be one of the most promising techniques to derive a precise distance to the lmc , and it is based on a very elegant idea . from the analysis of the radial velocity and light - curve one obtains very accurate values for the masses and radii of the two binary components , as well as for the ratio of the effective temperatures . fitting the uv / optical spectrum with model atmospheres",
    "one obtains the reddening , effective temperature and distance .",
    "this method , as already stressed , has been put forward as _ the _ way to obtain a very accurate dm to the lmc , in particular when more systems will be analysed .",
    "guinan et al . ( 1998a ; hereafter g98a ) found dm = 18.30 @xmath3 0.07 ( the derived distance modulus to hv 2274 was 18.35 @xmath3 0.07 . a geometric correction has been then applied to obtain the distance to the center of the lmc ) after applying this technique .",
    "more recently nelson et al .  ( 2000 ) corrected the g98a value after re - determining the reddening toward hv 2274 ; they obtained dm = 18.40 @xmath3 0.07 , a value only marginally in agreement with the long distance .",
    "however , they did not apply the method by g98a , deriving the distance correction only in an indirect way .    because of the relevance of the method employed by g98a for deriving the lmc distance and in light of the recent claims by nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for a longer lmc distance , we want in the present paper to re - analyse the fitting procedure of the uv / optical spectrum , and carefully point out the uncertainties of this method .",
    "unfortunately , in their 4-page _ letter _ , g98a could not present all the intricate details that _ are _ involved in the application of this method , but which should be pointed out to the scientific community in order to judge the strengths and weaknesses of this technique ( also see feast 2001 )",
    ". we will also study the sensitivity of the derived distance to both the set of model atmospheres and of optical photometric data employed in the fitting procedure .    in sect .  2 we present an historical overview of observations and studies related to the hv 2274 distance . in sect",
    ".  3 and 4 , we discuss , respectively , the observational data and the method employed for the distance determination .",
    "results are presented in sect .  5 , while a discussion follows in sect .",
    "watson et al . ( 1992 ) presented johnson @xmath6 and cousins @xmath7 ccd photometry of hv 2274 .",
    "the estimated out - of - eclipse magnitudes are @xmath0 = 14.16 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 with uncertainties of `` not as large as 0.1 mag '' .",
    "guinan et al .  ( 1998b - hereafter g98b ) discussed new observational data of hv 2274 .",
    "they took iue uv ( 1200 - 3000  ) spectra and fitted them with kurucz atlas 9 model atmospheres .",
    "they also obtained uv spectra ( 1150 - 4820  ) with the hst / fos spectrograph , and medium resolution spectra with the hst / ghrs to obtain the radial velocity curve . the radial velocity curve and light curve ( from watson et al .",
    "1992 ) were analysed to provide accurate determinations of ( amongst others ) the ratio of the effective temperatures and the gravities .",
    "then , using the method outlined below , of fitting the fos spectrum ( plus @xmath10 , from , in this case , watson et al . ) with model atmospheres taking into account the effect of extinction and using the constraints from the radial velocity and light - curve solution , they derived the micro - turbulent velocity ( assumed equal for the 2 components ) , @xmath2 and coefficients describing the uv extinction in the hv 2274 line - of - sight , the effective temperature of the primary , the metallicity ( assumed equal for the 2 components ) , and the distance ( see table  2 ) .",
    "considering the fact that hv 2274 was estimated by them to be 1100 pc behind the center of the lmc , they derived a dm = 18.44 @xmath3 0.07 .",
    "then , two papers appeared in the same issue of the astrophysical journal , udalski et al .",
    "( 1998b ; hereafter upw98 ) and g98a .",
    "the former was a reaction to a _ pre - print _ version of g98a ( astro - ph/9809132v1 ; which quoted @xmath11 , and a dm to the binary of 18.47 @xmath3 0.07 ) and presented out - of - eclipse ogle - ii @xmath12 photometry ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) of hv 2274 .",
    "upw98 derived the reddening to hv 2274 from @xmath10 and @xmath17 , using the colours of unreddened galactic b - stars , and assuming the mean lmc reddening line of @xmath18 .",
    "they derived @xmath19 .",
    "they did not repeat the fitting procedure in g98a and g98b , but noted that in the reddest part of the spectrum , near 4800  , the reddening is proportional to 3.8 @xmath2 ( udalski et al .",
    "hence implicitly assumed a galactic type reddening curve ) , and derived a distance modulus that was shorter by ( 3.8 @xmath20 mag , or dm = 18.22 @xmath3 0.13 .",
    "they chose not to apply a geometrical correction .",
    "the published version of g98a already considered a preprint version of upw98 , and fitted the fos spectrum plus @xmath21 data , not from watson et al .",
    "( 1992 - as was done in g98b ) , but already with that from upw98 .",
    "they derived @xmath22 and dm = 18.35 @xmath3 0.07 to hv 2274 .",
    "this already indicates the sensitivity of the solution to the adopted photometry that is included in the fitting procedure .",
    "we remark here that , as mentioned in g98a , it is necessary to include in the fitting procedure photometric data in the wavelength region between 4400 and 5500   ( hence the use of @xmath10 data ) , otherwise a possible degeneracy between the parameters determining the reddening law and @xmath2 does exist .",
    "nelson et al .  ( 2000 ) noted the uncertainty in obtaining `` standard '' @xmath23 and @xmath24 photometry , and criticized upw98 for using a non - standard @xmath23 filter and few calibration observations .",
    "they obtained @xmath25 photometry of stars in a field around the binary . for hv",
    "2274 they obtained @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the errors came from the rms residuals in the transformation from instrumental magnitudes to the standard system .",
    "these colours differ significantly from those of upw98 .",
    "nelson et al .  ( 2000 ) ascribed this mainly to a difference in the @xmath23-filter , and , likely , to a smaller extent , to differences in the @xmath24-filter .",
    "they then used , similarly to upw98 , @xmath10 and @xmath17 colours to derive a reddening to hv 2274 of @xmath29 . without re - doing the analysis of g98a , b they noted that this reddening is almost identical to that in g98b and therefore they suggested that a dm of 18.40 @xmath3 0.07 to the center of the lmc is the appropriate one .",
    "the calibrated out - of - eclipse fos spectrum consists of four individual spectra , covering four adjacent wavelength regions spanning the range between approximately 1200 and 4800  .",
    "the calibrated spectra have been taken from the hst archive and provide with observed wavelength , flux ( in erg s@xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath30 ) , and the formal error on the flux .",
    "the observed wavelengths are transformed to rest wavelengths using the measured radial velocity of the binary system of + 312 ( @xmath3 4 ) km s@xmath30  ( see ribas et al .",
    "it is not clear if this correction was applied by g98a , b or not .",
    "we find that we obtain a significantly lower @xmath32 including this correction . on the other hand ,",
    "the resolution of the model atmospheres used is such that it is not necessary to consider the fact that the 2 binary components have different radial velocities , due to their orbital motion .    before merging the data of different wavelength regions we have compared the fluxes ( with errors ) in the overlap regions .",
    "we found no reason to scale the different spectra , as possible scaling factors are less than 1% .",
    "this possible error is considered later - on in the final error budget .",
    "the final merged spectrum has been rebinned to the wavelength grid of the model atmospheres we will use ( see next section ) , which are at a lower resolution than the fos spectrum .",
    "this step was also performed by g98a , b . for each wavelength point",
    "@xmath33 in the model atmosphere we calculate the weighted mean and error of the flux of the fos spectrum between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , using linear interpolation to estimate the flux and error at the begin- and end - point . later on",
    "we will argue that these formal errors are likely to be underestimates of the true errors .    as a last step one has to remove data points that are affected by interstellar lines ( as was done by g98a ,",
    "b ) . in fact",
    ", the wavelengths of these points can be read from fig .  2 in g98a , but also stand out clearly as deviations between the model fit ( see below ) and the observations .",
    "after removing these points the final spectrum used in the model fitting contains 254 data points between 1145 and 4790  .    the other observational data needed to apply the method described in g98a , b are broad - band photometry .",
    "g98b used @xmath10 from watson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , while g98a used @xmath10 from upw98 , which has a much smaller error .",
    "there is also @xmath36 data available from upw98 , which was not used by g98a as additional constraint , but will be used by us together with the upw98 @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that g98a did not make use of the @xmath36 data is surprising as one of the problems in the fitting procedure noted by them is a degeneracy between the parameters determining the reddening law , and @xmath2 .",
    "an additional constraint at longer wavelengths might therefore be very helpful .",
    "to summarise , the reference observational data we will use consist of 256 observational data points , 254 coming from the binned fos spectrum after removing points that are contaminated by interstellar lines , @xmath10 and @xmath36 .    recently , the teams representing the 2mass  @xmath37 survey ( beichman et al . 1998 ) and the denis  @xmath38 survey ( epchtein et al . 1999 , cioni et al . 2000 ) released data that contain the magellanic cloud area .",
    "hv 2274 is not in the denis  database , but it is in the 2masssurvey .",
    "the position quoted is ( j2000 ) : ra= 5h 02 m 40.74s , dec = @xmath39d 24 m 21.46s , with magnitudes @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the 2mass  user support & help desk kindly checked their database to communicate the time of observation to be 1998 oct 25 , 07h 27 m 30.48s ut .",
    "this corresponds to jd = 245 1111.689 .",
    "these data can not be used as constraint as it will be argued later that this observation happens to almost coincide with a primary eclipse , and so can not be used to constrain the parameters as determined from the out - of - eclipse fos spectrum and @xmath12 photometry .",
    "the method employed is essentially identical to that used by g98a , b . using the constraints that come from the ( independent ) modelling of the radial velocity and light - curve , model atmospheres are fitted to the ( binned ) uv fos spectrum and broad - band data .    in more detail ,",
    "the total out - of - eclipse flux of the binary at each wavelength bin can be written as ( see g98a ) : @xmath43\\ ] ] @xmath44}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the radii of , respectively , the primary and secondary component , @xmath47 is the distance , @xmath48 and @xmath49 the emergent fluxes from the two components , @xmath50 is the ratio of selective to total reddening in @xmath0 , @xmath2 is the colour excess and @xmath51 is the normalised extinction curve defined as @xmath52 .",
    "the model atmospheres we employed are described below ; in general they can be characterised by four parameters : effective temperature , gravity , metallicity and micro - turbulent velocity .",
    "the micro - turbulent velocity is fixed at 2 km s@xmath30 , following the result of g98a ( see below ) and is assumed to be the same for both components .",
    "the gravity of the two components , the ratio of the stellar radii and the ratio of the effective temperatures follow from the radial velocity and light - curve analysis ( see g98a , summarized in table  1 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that both components have the same metallicity .",
    "this leaves four parameters : the effective temperature of the primary , the metallicity , @xmath2 and the scaling factor @xmath53 from which the distance is derived ( @xmath47 [ kpc ] = 70.26/@xmath54 for @xmath45 = 9.86 r@xmath55 , see table  1 ) .",
    "the inclusion of the extinction curve in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is an essential ingredient in the procedure , and is discussed in detail below .",
    "it involves in our case five additional free parameters .",
    "the procedure is as follows . by considering the constraints listed in tab .",
    "1 the nine free parameters are varied so that the following function is minimised : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 we use a levenberg - marquardt non - linear least - squares method ( press et al .",
    "the method makes use of the derivatives of @xmath32 with respect to the free parameters , which are calculated numerically ] where @xmath59 = @xmath60 . following the considerations in press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and numerical experiments , we choose @xmath61 for the variable effective temperature , @xmath62 for the variables metallicity and @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for all others . ] .",
    "the errors in the parameters are calculated from the square - root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix ( see press et al .",
    "1992 ) .    before going on discussing the model atmospheres and",
    "extinction law adopted in the fitting procedure , we want to comment briefly about the parameters listed in table 1 .",
    "they are derived either directly from the light curve analysis ( e.g. , @xmath65 ) or by combining the results from the light curve analysis with the results from the radial velocity curve solution .",
    "in particular , the value of @xmath66 is obtained from @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the orbital semimajor axis derived from the radial velocity curve , and @xmath69 the fractional radius derived from the light - curve solution . when performing the light - curve analysis , apart from the need to assume some value for the albedos and gravity - darkening exponents",
    ", it is necessary to employ even at this stage theoretical model atmospheres ( see , e.g. the discussion in milone et al .",
    "1992 ) , from which , for example , limb - darkening coefficients are derived ; in the case of hv 2274 , g98ab used ( according to ribas et al .",
    "2000 ) a version of the wilson - devinney ( 1971 ) program that includes the kurucz atlas 9 ( see next subsection ) model atmosphere routine developed by milone et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "the errors quoted in table 1 are formal errors obtained from the given set of assumptions made by the authors and from the observational errors .",
    "it is dificult to assess the uncertainty on the parameters estimated from the light curve analysis due to uncertainties on model atmospheres .",
    "milone et al .",
    "( 1992 ) discussed in detail the case of the eclipsing binary ai phoenicis ; even if the two components of this system are much colder objects than hv 2274 , it can be instructive to notice that by changing the underlying model atmospheres ( black body , carbon - gingerich  1969 models , kurucz  1979 models , kurucz  1979 models corrected for the missing ultraviolet opacity ) and band passes employed in the light curve analysis , the value of the fractional radii of both components are basically unchanged , while the ratio @xmath65 varies at most by @xmath51.6% .        from model 5",
    "we get @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( where the errors are the internal errors due to the fitting procedure only ) ; from eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) one obtains @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "these values are consistent with the corresponding quantitites recently determined by misselt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for their lmc - average sample of stars .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting normalised uv and optical extinction curve .",
    "the value of @xmath2 obtained from model 5 is @xmath2 = 0.103 @xmath3 0.007 .",
    "it is important to notice that this value is different from the one derived by g98b ( @xmath2 = 0.120 @xmath3 0.009 ) and from the determination by upw98 ( @xmath2 = 0.149 @xmath3 0.015 ) who used colour - colour @xmath77 relationships . since we are using the @xmath10 ( and @xmath36 ) photometric data by upw98 as constraint for the spectrum fit we investigated the possibility that the reddening derived from the spectrum fit is inconsistent with hv2274 broad band photometry .",
    "we followed the same procedure by upw98 that is , to consider a local standard @xmath77 sequence of stars with the same spectral type as hv 2274 , and derive the reddening from the displacement of the position of hv 2274 with respect to the standard sequence , for an assumed @xmath78 ratio .",
    "we used the same standard colour - colour sequence employed by upw98 ( for b - stars of luminosity class iii ) , and a ratio @xmath78 derived from our adopted extinction law using the value of @xmath50 derived from the fit ( which is by the way very close to the standard value of 3.1 ) . by computing appropriate stellar models ( using the same input physics and colour transformations as in salaris & weiss 1998 and a scaled - solar metal distribution ) for solar metallicity and the metallicity derived from model 5 , with masses around 12@xmath79 , we verified that the location of b stars on the @xmath77 plane does not vary in this metallicity range .",
    "as for the @xmath10 colour of hv 2274 we used the value by upw98 , while for @xmath17 we derived the value from the fos spectrum ( see section 4.2 ) , since it covers the wavelength region spanned by this colour index .",
    "the @xmath17 colour derived from the spectrum is different from the value observed by upw98 .",
    "the fos spectrum provides @xmath17 = @xmath800.836 @xmath3 0.006 , while upw98 measured @xmath17 = @xmath800.905 @xmath3 0.04 .",
    "nelson et al .  ( 2000 ) measured @xmath17 = @xmath81 @xmath3 0.031 which is closer ( but still inconsistent at the 1@xmath82 level ) to the value derived from the fos spectrum . from the colour - colour diagram",
    "we get @xmath2 = 0.115 @xmath3 0.015 which is consistent , within 1@xmath82 , with the value derived from model 5 .",
    "the value of [ m / h ] from the reference model , taking the formal error from the fit plus the external errors from models 7 - 16 is @xmath83 .",
    "this is relative to the adopted iron abundance of 7.67 in the kurucz models .",
    "this implies that the metallicity relative to the currently favoured solar iron abundance of 7.51 ( grevesse & noels 1993 )",
    "is [ fe / h ] = @xmath84 .",
    "model 6 computed using butler atmospheres has [ m / h ] = @xmath85 relative to a solar abundance of 7.46 , [ fe / h ] = @xmath86 relative to the solar abundance of grevesse & noels .",
    "these values are in good agreement with each other , but significantly more metal rich than the value of @xmath87 to @xmath88 found by g98a , b .",
    "observationally there are few direct iron abundance determinations for hot and young stars in the lmc .",

    "korn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) determined the iron abundance in 5 non - supergiant b - stars , the average value being @xmath91 .",

    "( 1992 ) a primary eclipse is predicted at jd = 2451111.697 @xmath3 0.006 , taking into account the error in the time determination of the reference primary eclipse and the period . the shift of 0.008 @xmath3 0.006 days , or 0.0014 in phase is negligible , also in light of the fact that phase shifts of up to 0.05 occur due to apsidal rotation ( watson et al .",
    "1992 ) .    in the optical the magnitude difference between out - of - eclipse and",
    "primary eclipse are 0.72 , 0.71 and 0.70 mag in @xmath93 , respectively ( watson et al . 1992 ) .",

    "this is in good agreement with the value extrapolated from the magnitude difference between out - of - eclipse and primary eclipse measured in the optical .",
    "however , as emphasised later , out - of - eclipse nir photometry would be important in further constraining the parameters of the model .      in this paper",
    "we have described and analyzed in detail the method used by g98a , b to derive the distance to the eclipsing binary hv 2274 in the lmc .",
    "we used various sets of theoretical spectra and broad band photometric data in the fitting procedure outlined in section 4 , and we found that kurucz atlas 9 spectra best reproduce the observed spectrum of hv 2274 .",
    "the selection of the wavelength range to be covered by the spectrum fit and the constraint on @xmath50 play also a role in determining the outcome of the fitting procedure .",
    "we are now going to comment briefly about this point .    in the reference model",
    "we fitted hv 2274 fos data plus @xmath10 and @xmath36 colours ( from upw98 ) using atlas 9 spectra , constraining the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 of the uv extinction law according to equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) and keeping @xmath50 as a free parameter .",
    "the use of @xmath36 is dictated by our desire to use all available information about the spectral energy distribution of hv 2274 .",
    "the homogeneous @xmath12 photometry by upw98 makes it possible to cover all the spectral range from uv to near - infrared .",
    "neglecting @xmath36 , that means , fitting a smaller wavelength range , induces a decrease by 0.10 mag in the distance modulus derived from the fitting procedure .",
    "if we consider the atlas 9 models as an accurate reproduction of the real spectra of b stars , this difference can be ascribed to the fact that there is information about the distance contained in the @xmath36 colour , and therefore it must be included in the fitting procedure .",
    "conversely , this result could also imply that atlas 9 spectra are inconsistent with observations at the longer wavelengths or that broad - band photometry and fos spectrum are not homogeneously calibrated . in this respect",
    ", one should keep in mind that the @xmath17 value derived from the fos spectrum is inconsistent with the @xmath17 determined by upw98 and nelson et al .",

    "however , it is not clear why one should fix the value of @xmath50 a priori , since it is known that it is subjected to variations within the lmc and within our galaxy . finally , the use of the @xmath10 by nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) together with the fos spectrum produces a distance modulus even larger ( 0.16 mag larger than the case of using upw98 data ) .",
    "the quality of the fit is only marginally lower , and the reddening compares well with the value ( @xmath5 0.08 ) one would derive from the colour - colour diagram considering the nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) @xmath10 and the fos @xmath17 .",
    "a last comment is that it is very unfortunate that the 2mass  infrared data happens to be taken during eclipse .",
    "the difference in predicted @xmath97 between the different models is up to 0.15 mag ( see table  5 ) .",
    "therefore , accurate nir photometry or even nir spectroscopy at the 1% level is expected to give valuable additional constraints .",
    "+ the conclusion is that the use of eclipsing binaries as distance indicators is powerful , but that a photometrically well calibrated data set covering a large wavelength region is essential . furthermore , the discrepancies among the different theoretical model atmospheres is worrying and need further investigation .",
