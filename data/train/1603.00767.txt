    "an electron in the ground state of hydrogen atom in bohr s model has an orbital period of 150 attosecond ( 1 as=@xmath4 s ) . in order to temporally",
    "resolve electronic dynamics in real time , it is necessary to follow its dynamics within attosecond time scales .",
    "nowadays , this attosecond temporal resolution is accessible with attosecond and even femtosecond laser pulses [ 1 ] .",
    "first attosecond laser pulse was measured in 2001 based on high - oder harmonic generation ( hhg)[2,3 ] .",
    "the underlying mechanism of hhg is often described by a three - step semi - classical model [ 4 ] . in the first step , an electron releases into continuum via tunneling .",
    "then , the electron moves away from the ion , but it is driven back when the field laser sign reverses . eventually , energetic photons are emitted via the recombination of the released electron with its parent ion .",
    "the three - step model predicts maximum recollision energy of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , is the pondermotive energy in which @xmath7 and @xmath8 are laser intensity and angular frequency , respectively .",
    "the improved version of the three - step model has been also introduced by lewenstein _",
    "et al_. by incorporating quantum mechanical corrections [ 5 ] .",
    "the characteristics of each emitted photon in the hhg process are determined by both the driving laser field and the generating medium .",
    "for example , for gaussian - like laser pulses having rising and falling parts , the effective amplitude of each cycle experienced by atoms and molecules changes non - adiabatically from a laser cycle to another .",
    "thus , the energy acquired in each cycle by the freed electron is different .",
    "this non - adiabatic response of a medium to a rapidly changing laser field leads to a frequency red - shift ( blue - shift ) of harmonics at the falling ( rising ) part of the laser pulse [ 6 - 9 ] .    in practice , it is difficult to observe purely the non - adiabatic redshift on the laser falling edge in atoms as the blue - shift usually occurs at the laser rising edge .",
    "when the laser intensity is above the saturation intensity threshold , @xmath9 , most harmonic emission occurs at the laser rising part which means that only blue - shifted harmonics are expected to appear . in other words ,",
    "hhg is suppressed considerably at the laser falling edge due to a high population depletion at the rising part .",
    "if the laser intensity is below @xmath9 , the non - adiabatic blueshift and redshift are comparable .",
    "thereby , the spectrum of each harmonic broadens and no net shift is observed .",
    "the non - adiabatic blue - shift of the harmonics has been reported experimentally [ 10,11 ] , but there is no experimental report on the non - adiabatic redshift for both atoms and molecules .    in molecules because of more degrees of freedom than atoms , it is possible to observe both the non - adiabatic redshift and blueshift under appropriate conditions .",
    "it is shown that the nuclear motion can serve as a controllable tool to trap the non - adiabatic redshift in molecules for the gaussian [ 12 ] and trapezoidal [ 13 ] laser pulses .",
    "the ionization and recombination processes can be controlled to occur dominantly on the trailing edge of the laser pulse by choosing appropriate laser parameters and molecule .",
    "in fact , the time - dependent ionization of molecules permits the observation of the non - adiabatic redshift",
    ". references [ 12,13 ] are focused on the non - adiabatic redshift induced by the falling edge of the laser pulse .    in this work ,",
    "we similarly control the harmonic emission at the falling laser part by choosing a proper pulse shape and molecules . for this purpose , isotopes h@xmath0 and t@xmath0 under a 15-cycle trapezoidal laser",
    "are investigated .",
    "we show that harmonic emission at the 4-cycle laser falling part is negligible for h@xmath0 due to the ionization suppression , but it is considerable for t@xmath0 .",
    "thus , we attribute the difference of the hhg spectrum between these two isotopes to the induced effects of the falling edge .",
    "we identify spatially asymmetric emission as a distinct induced effect of the falling edge .",
    "the spatially asymmetric emission appears as even harmonic orders as a result of the spatial symmetry breaking .    in this report",
    ", our focus is mainly to introduce and identify spatially asymmetric emission . to our knowledge , this kind of spatially asymmetric emission has not been addressed and clarified in the literature . in order to understand deeply the underlying physics behind the asymmetric emission , hhg is spatially resolved and decomposed into different localized signals .    in this work , three - dimensional electronic time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation ( nbo )",
    "is numerically solved for h@xmath0 and t@xmath0 .",
    "calculations have been done with 15-cycle trapezoidal laser pulses at 800 nm wavelength and @xmath13 @xmath2 w@xmath3 intensity .",
    "we assume that molecular ions are aligned with their internuclear - distance axis parallel to the laser polarization direction .",
    "the molecular alignment is frequently implied experimentally nowadays [ 14 - 16 ] .",
    "we use atomic units throughout the article unless stated otherwise .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation for homonuclear hydrogen - like molecular ions with the electron s coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be written ( after a separation of the center - of - mass motion and ignoring molecular rotations ) as [ 17 - 18 ]    @xmath12    where @xmath13 denotes internuclear distance ( parallel to both electronic coordinate @xmath10 and the laser polarization direction ) and  is the total electronic and nuclear hamiltonian which is given by @xmath14 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\mathlarger{-\\frac{1}{m_n}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2}+v_c(z , \\rho , r;t)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 in the above equations , @xmath16 is the laser peak amplitude , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are masses of the electron and single nucleus , respectively , @xmath8 angular frequency , and _",

    "the detail of the numerical procedure is described in our previous works [ 21 - 23 ] .",

    "the size of the simulation box is chosen as @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "the hanning filter reduces the effect of nondecaying components in the dipole acceleration that last after the laser pulse is switched off [ 24 ] .",

    "figure 1 shows the hhg spectrum of 3d h@xmath0 and t@xmath0 under a 15-cycle trapezoidal laser pulse ( 4 - 7 - 4 ) at @xmath55 nm and @xmath56 w@xmath3 .",
    "we have depicted the plateau region up to the cutoff region in order to focus only on recombinations from the continuum wavepacket to the @xmath57 and @xmath34 states .",
    "interpretation of a hhg spectrum below the ionization potential @xmath58 ( @xmath59 corresponding to harmonic order @xmath60 20 ) demands further investigation due to the transitions between the bound electronic states which was not intended in this work . for h@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , one can observe that odd harmonic orders are dominant . but for t@xmath0 , some non - odd harmonics and slightly red - shifted odd harmonics are seen for harmonic order 20 - 40 .",
    "these differences in the spectrum pattern for the two isotopes are well understood with the consideration of effects of the falling edge of the laser pulse , nuclear motion and ionization probability .",
    "we showed recently that even a two - cycle falling part of a trapezoidal laser pulse leads to a significant modulation on the hhg spectrum and violation of the odd harmonic rule [ 13 ] . in order to see the contribution of the falling part of the laser pulse in hhg , the morlet - wavelet time profile of the hhg spectra of fig .",
    "1 are shown for both isotopes in fig .",
    "2 . as it is clear for h@xmath0 in fig .",
    "2(a ) , most hhg has happened before the time @xmath61 optical cycles ( o.c . ) and contribution from the laser falling part ( @xmath62 o.c . )",
    "is much lesser than the region with @xmath63 o.c . but for t@xmath0 in fig .",
    "2(b ) , one observes considerable hhg at the falling edge of the laser pulse .",
    "the results of our simulation in this work show that the ionization probability for h@xmath0 and t@xmath0 at @xmath61 o.c .",
    "( at the time that laser falling part begins ) , is @xmath60 56@xmath64 and 6@xmath64 , respectively .",
    "this further population depletion of h@xmath0 compared to t@xmath0 is due to the charge - resonance enhanced ionization at large internuclear separations [ 21 ] which is more accessible for h@xmath0 than t@xmath0 because of a faster nuclear motion in the former .",
    "therefore , the hhg spectrum difference observed in fig . 1 between h@xmath0 and t@xmath0 can arise from the induced effects of the laser falling edge",
    ". the small frequency redshift of odd harmonics in t@xmath0 is a well - known phenomenon resulting from the non - adiabatic response of the molecular ions to the rapidly changing field at the laser falling edge ( see for more details , refs .",
    "[ 6 - 9,12 ] ) .",
    "now , we try to spatially resolve the hhg spectra in fig . 1 to get further insight into the origin of the non - odd harmonics in t@xmath0 .",
    "3 , we have depicted @xmath13-dependent harmonic profile , @xmath65 , for h@xmath0 ( left panel ) and t@xmath0 ( right panel ) . for h@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , it is observed that hhg has been extended to the large internuclear separations up to @xmath66 , while for t@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , hhg ends up at the lower internuclear distances around @xmath67 .",
    "it is reasonable because t@xmath0 is about three times heavier than h@xmath0 and thus it has a slower nuclear motion under the same interaction time .",
    "another point in fig .",
    "3(a ) is that odd harmonics are dominant over whole internuclear separations . but for t@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , we see odd harmonic orders are dominant up to @xmath68 , but both odd and even harmonics appear for @xmath69 . for h@xmath0 that has reached to larger @xmath13 values than t@xmath0 , we do not observe any even harmonics because of the ionization suppression at the laser falling region .",
    "it is also obvious that larger internuclear distances ( @xmath69 ) become accessible at longer times .",
    "above - mentioned points on fig .",
    "3 support our claim that the appearance of even - order harmonics in t@xmath0 for @xmath69 is due to the effects of the falling edge of the laser pulse .    to understand better the physics behind the non - odd harmonics in fig .",
    "1 for t@xmath0 , we also calculated spatial distributions of corresponding hhg spectra as a function of the electronic coordinate @xmath10 , @xmath70 ( left panels ) and @xmath71 ( right panels ) which are shown in fig . 4 for h@xmath0 ( top row ) and t@xmath0 ( bottom row ) .",

    ", one sees little probability for the harmonic emission which is also observed and demonstrated for h@xmath0 in ref . [",
    "another point in fig .",
    "4(a ) is that hhg for two regions @xmath75 and @xmath76 is symmetric for both odd and even harmonic orders .",
    "but in fig .",
    "4(c ) for t@xmath0 , the hhg symmetry at positive and negative directions relative to the origin @xmath44 is broken .",

    "it is observed for h@xmath0 that @xmath50 and @xmath51 show both even and odd harmonic orders with comparable intensity ( fig .",
    "5(a ) ) . for @xmath77 ,",
    "even harmonic orders are canceled out and odd ones are intensified .",
    "the suppression of even harmonics is due to the interference term 2re@xmath54 $ ] . as harmonic emission is symmetric for h@xmath0 in negative and positive @xmath10 direction ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , hhg suppression ( build - up ) occurs for even ( odd ) harmonics based on the odd - selection rule [ 30 ] . for t@xmath0 in fig .",
    "5(b ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 differ slightly which is more noticeable around even harmonics .",
    "that shows that we expect to have some degrees of asymmetric emission which is compatible with asymmetry observed in fig .",
    "for @xmath77 , one can see some even harmonics are not canceled out completely . based on above explanations , it can be concluded that harmonic peaks around even harmonic orders in fig .",
    "1 result from symmetry breaking in hhg on the left and right side of the simulation box around the nuclei when hhg on the falling part of the laser pulse is noticeable .",

    "_ [ 31 ] also reported even - order harmonics in 1d h@xmath0 under a 14-cycle sine - squared laser pulse at 800 nm wavelength and @xmath13 @xmath2 w@xmath3 intensity .",
    "they claimed that the observation of even harmonics is due to electron localization at large internuclear separation which breaks down the system s symmetry . to see whether electron localization has happened in our work , we calculated absolute asymmetry parameter @xmath78 ( see ref . [ 32 ] ) as depicted in fig .",

    ", asymmetry parameter @xmath79 values not only show the same value at the end of simulations but also go to zero for both isotopes which demonstrate that electron localization is ignorable .",

    "the different time - dependent ionization suppression of these two isotopes allowed us to observe clearly the induced effects of the 4-cycle trailing edge . in h@xmath0 ,",
    "most hhg occurs before the falling edge of the laser pulse due to the high population depletion , leading to ionization suppression on the falling edge . but",
    "a substantial harmonic emission appears for t@xmath0 on the laser trailing edge .",
    "we found two different induced effects .",
    "the first well - known effect is non - adiabatic frequency redshift which arises due to nonadiabatic response of a medium to the rapidly changing falling edge of the laser pulse .",
    "the second one is spatially asymmetric emission on the left and right side of the simulation box in the @xmath10 direction which induces even harmonic orders . in order to understand better the asymmetric emission , we spatially resolved hhg in terms of internuclear distance and electronic coordinate @xmath10 in the same direction as laser polarization one .",
    "in addition , we decompose hhg signal to different localized signal corresponding to recombination to left and right protons . the spatially asymmetric emission could be considered for single- and multi - electron atomic and molecular systems as long as either one of the rising or falling parts of the laser pulse is dominant , even for non - trapezoidal laser pulses .",
