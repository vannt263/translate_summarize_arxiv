    "the presence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in our universe is now well established by a number of observational experiments , especially the very precise measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment @xcite .",
    "the measured value of the cdm relic density is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath3 km / mpc / s . though the gravitation nature of the dark matter is established , we know almost nothing about the particle nature , except that it is , to a high extent , electrically neutral .",
    "one of the most appealing and natural cdm particle candidates is _ weakly - interacting massive particle _ ( wimp ) .",
    "it is a coincidence that if the dark matter is produced thermally in the early universe , the required annihilation cross section is right at the order of weak interaction .",
    "the relation between the relic density and the thermal annihilation cross section can be given by the following simple formula @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the annihilation rate of the dark matter around the time of freeze - out .",
    "given the measured @xmath6 the annihilation rate is about @xmath7 pb or @xmath8 .",
    "this is exactly the size of the cross sections that one expects from a weak interaction process and that would give a large to moderate production rate at the lhc . in general , production of dark matter at the lhc would give rise to a large missing energy .",
    "thus , the anticipated signature in the final state is high-@xmath9 jets or leptons plus a large missing energy .",
    "note that there could be non - thermal sources for the dark matter , such as decay from exotic relics like moduli fields , cosmic strings , etc . in such cases , the annihilation rate in eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) can be larger than the value quoted above .",
    "the most studied dark matter candidate is perhaps the neutralino of the supersymmetric models with @xmath10-parity conservation . in this work",
    ", we study a different scenario .",
    "the dark matter is in a hidden sector and the only standard model ( sm ) particle that it interacts with is the top quark .",
    "the top quark , having a mass so close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , makes itself so unique among the fermions .",
    "it is perhaps one of the best windows to probe the electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ". the dark matter , if it is a wimp , is also closely related to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the logic is that since both the top quark and the wimp are closely related to electroweak symmetry breaking , we argue that the top quark may be the only window to probe the dark matter .",
    "this is our motivation .",
    "we use an effective lagrangian approach to parameterize the interactions between the top quark and the dark matter particle , without specifying the detailed communication between the top quark and the hidden sector .",
    "one simple example would be a hidden - sector gauge boson that can couple to the top quark .",
    "if it is heavy enough we can shrink the propagator to a 4-fermion vertex .",
    "one form of the 4-fermion interaction is @xmath11 for a vector - type interaction or @xmath12 for an axial - vector - type interaction .",
    "we can estimate the size of the new interaction based on the fact that it is the only interaction that can thermalize the dark matter particle in the early universe .",
    "the most interesting implication of the scenario is the collider signature .",
    "the final state consists of a top - quark pair and a pair of dark matter particles , giving rise to a top - quark pair plus a large missing energy . on the other hand , we anticipate that the spin - independent and spin - dependent cross sections in direct detection would be consistent with the current limit .",
    "this is easy to understand because the top content inside the nucleon is so small that it hardly contributes to the dm - nucleon scattering .",
    "we will explicitly show that .",
    "in addition , the annihilation of the dark matter in the galactic halo would give rise to positrons and antiprotons that can be observed by antimatter search experiments , e.g. , pamela and amsii .",
    "we use the present data on positron and antiproton spectra from pamela to constrain the size of the effective interactions .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the interaction between the top quark and the dark matter particle , and estimate the size of the interaction based on the relic density . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the spin - independent and spin - dependent cross sections for direct detection . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the positron and antiproton spectra due to the dm annihilation in galactic halo . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the collider signature . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "there are a few recent works @xcite that assumed some form of effective interactions between the dark matter and light quarks and studied the corresponding collider phenomenology .",
    "_ @xcite also wrote down the effective nonrelativistic interactions between the dark matter and nuclei .",
    "our simple model consists of the sm and a hidden sector , in which there is a pair of dirac / majorana fermions and a gauge boson . for some reasons this gauge boson couples this hidden fermion only to the top quark on the sm side .",
    "if the mass of this gauge boson is heavy enough , we can integrate it out .",
    "more generally , below the heavy mass scale @xmath13 the interaction between the top quark and the dark matter particle , denoted by @xmath14 , is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 for a vector gauge boson , @xmath17 for an axial - vector gauge boson , @xmath18 for a scalar ( pseudoscalar ) boson interaction , and @xmath19 with @xmath20 for a tensor ( axial - tensor ) interaction , and @xmath21 is an effective coupling constant .",
    "for majorana fermions the @xmath22 or @xmath23 type interaction is identically zero , and so for vector or tensor type interaction the fermion @xmath14 in eq.([eff ] ) must be dirac . explicitly , we assume the dark matter candidate to be dirac , but the results are also applicable to majorana dark matter . with this interaction we can calculate the thermal averaged cross sections and thus the relic density , the direct and indirect detection rates , and also the production cross section of @xmath24 at the lhc .",
