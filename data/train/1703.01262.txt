    "thallium activated sodium iodide ( nai(tl ) ) scintillators have been widely used for radiation detection @xcite since they were proposed by r. hofstadter in 1948 @xcite . among other remarkable features ,",
    "the very high intrinsic scintillation light yield has been probably a key factor to widespread their use .",
    "sodium iodide scintillators have been applied very satisfactorily in fields so different as : nuclear medicine , environmental monitoring , nuclear physics , aerial survey , well logging , homeland security , etc .",
    "energy ranges from 10  kev to several mev can be covered with state - of - the - art technology , but applications requiring high sensitivity at lower energies have moved to other detection techniques having better energy resolution and/or lacking from the hygroscopic property of nai , that makes difficult the access of low energy radiation to the sensitive volume .",
    "however , these detectors have been successfully applied since the nineties in the direct search for dark matter in the form of wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) , that should pervade the galactic halo and because of the very low interaction probability with matter they have , they could reach that sensitive volume independently of the encapsulation or even the placement of the detector in an underground location , as it is usually done in order to reduce the cosmic - ray - induced background .",
    "several experimental efforts using nai(tl ) detectors applied in the search for dark matter can be found in the literature @xcite , as well as several proposals for the next future @xcite .",
    "the anais project aims at the installation of a 112.5  kg nai(tl ) experiment at the canfranc underground laboratory ( lsc ) , in spain , to study the annual modulation effect expected in the interaction rate of dark matter particles as result of the earth motion around the sun @xcite . in the frame of anais",
    "a long effort has been carried out in understanding radioactive backgrounds in nai(tl ) detectors @xcite and in the assessment of nai(tl ) detectors performance @xcite .",
    "for such a purpose , crystals from different providers ( bicron , saint - gobain and alpha spectra ) have been studied . in this work",
    ", we will present our estimates of total light collected at the pmts for low energy depositions produced using external sources , but also internal contaminations homogeneously distributed in the crystal bulk .",
    "total light seen by the light detection system in scintillating detectors is one of the most relevant figures of merit , contributing strongly to the achievable energy threshold , succesful implementation of pmt noise rejection procedures , and energy resolution .",
    "it depends on intrinsic scintillation light yield of the scintillating material and light collection efficiency of the detection system , including self - absorption , trapped light by total internal reflection , light losses by the multiple reflections and scattering in the non - sensitive detector surfaces , and quantum efficiency ( qe ) of the pmts used as light sensors .",
    "it can be determined as photoelectrons ( p.e . ) produced at pmt photocathode and reaching the first dynode per unit of energy deposited by comparing the signal produced by the full - absorption of a given energy in the scintillating material and the signal corresponding to a single p.e . ;",
    "then , it can be converted into scintillation photons reaching the pmt photocathode by correcting by the corresponding qe of the pmt units used . however , intrinsic scintillation light yield for nai(tl ) is not easy to deconvolve from the total light collected measurement , as light collection efficiency should be known .",
    "knoll and others @xcite suggested the intrinsic scintillation efficiency in nai(tl ) to be 40,000  photons / mev , implying a w@xmath0 value of 25  ev for the average energy required to produce a scintillation photon .",
    "however , there are theoretical estimates of lower w@xmath0 value in nai(tl ) , resulting in a maximum scintillation efficiency of about 100,000  photons / mev @xcite .",
    "the high light collection values reported in this work for very large nai(tl ) crystals using gamma / electron radiation at very low energy could be an interesting input for such calculations , as far as most of the previous reports and analysis are not reaching such low energy range @xcite and have been obtained with smaller crystals , for which light propagation and collection is not expected to be a so much relevant issue ; moreover , some aspects of the scintillation mechanism in nai(tl ) crystals are not yet fully understood @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following : in section [ set - up ] we describe the anais prototype modules used in the reported measurements and in section [ data - acq ] , the data acquisition system . in section [ analysis ]",
    "we describe our analysis procedure to derive the single electron response ( ser ) and the full - absorption lines considered for the determination of the light collected at each pmt .",
    "finally , in the last section results are presented and conclusions drawn .",
    "in this work , crystals from three different manufacturers , and having different size and shape , have been characterized in terms of the light collected at each pmt and in total at each crystal :    * a 10.7  kg hexagonal prism nai(tl ) crystal ( distance between opposite vertices in the hexagonal face 15.94  cm , and 20.32  cm high ) disassembled from the original stainless steel encapsulation made by bicron .",

    "piii and a0 modules took data in the same set - up ( a0 - 5 ) at lsc from august until december 2012 in order to precisely measure the @xmath2k content in the latter .",
    "* anais25 set - up : two as modules ( d0 and d1 ) took data at lsc from december 2012 until march 2015 to determine their internal contaminations and general performance assessment ; because of that , several upgrades were implemented , for instance , pmts in d1 module were replaced .",
    "data shown below correspond to phases i and iii of this set - up .",
    "* anais37 set - up : a new module ( d2 ) was placed in between d0 and d1 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the amount of photons per unit of energy arriving at the pmts in all the as modules is outstanding ( see table  [ tab : lightyield ] ) : more than 40  photons / kev , which is the typically assumed intrinsic scintillation light yield in nai(tl ) material  @xcite . if we consider the well - known nonproportional scintillation response of nai(tl )  @xcite ,",
    "an increase in light yield at 20  kev of about 20% with respect to that at 662  kev ( @xmath3cs gamma line ) , usually used as calibration standard , can be justified at most , that would mean no more than 50  photons / kev produced by a low energy deposition . thus , our results would imply a very high number of the photons produced by the interaction reaching the pmt photocathode ( @xmath480% ) in as modules .",
    "on the other hand , contribution from the slow scintillation components to the total light yield in nai(tl ) is significant  @xcite , and as far as our integration window is 1  @xmath1s , we are not fully including in our estimates all the light produced after the energy deposition .",
    "thus , a relevant conclusion of our measurement is that intrinsic light yield in nai(tl ) , as given in the literature , is probably underestimated in this energy range .",
    "moreover , we observe a systematic lower value for the light incident at the pmts in every module at 3.2  kev with respect to the value derived at 22.6  kev .",
    "this is consistent with the nonproportionality observed in @xcite at these very low energies , but not with the expected dependence on light yield with linear energy transfer ( let ) @xcite , which should be much higher for electrons at 3.2  kev , being near the maximum expected scintillation yield .",
    "further efforts to understand scintillation mechanisms in inorganic crystals in the low energy regime are still required .",
    "the use of light guides 10  cm long between the pmt photocathode and the quartz windows implies a worsening in light collection of about a 25% at 22.6  kev , by comparing a0 - 3 vs a0 - 4 set - ups results for the same crystal and pmts .",
    "this is a very relevant reduction .",
    "anais decided to optimize light collection in order to guarantee the lowest energy threshold , and no light guides were considered in the anais detectors design  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the energy threshold in nai(tl ) direct dark matter searches down to 1  kev allows a significant improvement in sensitivity to the parameter space region compatible with the annual modulation observed by dama / libra experiment  @xcite .",
    "the very high light collection measured in anais detectors is for sure very relevant to guarantee such an energy threshold at 1  kev , as far as the mean number of p.e . detected for this energy deposition with two pmts is around 15 ( see table  [ tab : phekev ] ) .",
    "trigger efficiency is of about 100% in these conditions , as it has been confirmed in anais analyzing the observed @xmath5na bulk contamination cosmogenically induced in the crystals . in fig .",
    "[ fig:0_9kev ] events selected by the coincidence with a 1274.5  kev gamma in a second detector are shown in blue , while those triggering our acquisition are shown in red for one of the anais as modules ; a clear line at 0.87  kev corresponding to the ne k - binding energy released after the @xmath5na ec decay is observed . in fig .

    "waveforms from both pmts are shown separately.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] +    however , the effect in the energy resolution is not so important as it could be thought , because energy resolution in inorganic scintillators is mainly dominated by the nonproportional characteristics of the scintillation  @xcite .",
    "for instance , total light collection reported by dama / libra in phase 1  @xcite is between 5.5 and 7.5  p.e./kev , a factor of two below the values reported in this paper , but energy resolution is not as different , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolution ] where energy resolution is shown for as modules and dama / libra experiment together with statistical limit for a total light collection of 15  p.e./kev .",
    "it has to be remarked that some of the lines shown in this plot do not correspond to calibration with external sources , but to long background measurements and bulk energy depositions , which implies that energy resolution could be easily degraded by slow gain drifts and spatial effects on light collection , not affecting data derived from external calibrations .",
    "notice that some of the energy resolution values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolution ] do not correspond to intrinsic energy resolution from monoenergetic lines , but to overall energy resolution in those cases several x - rays contributions are not resolved . at mev scale , typical values of energy resolution between 2.5 and 3.5%",
