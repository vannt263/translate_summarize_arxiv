    "the triga mark ii reactor at the applied nuclear energy laboratory ( l.e.n.a . ) of the university of pavia is a pool type reactor with a nominal power of 250 kw .",
    "it was brought to its first criticality in 1965 and since then it was used for several scientific activities , such as radioisotope production , material analysis via neutron activation and reactor physics studies .",
    "+ the reactor core is shaped as a right cylinder featuring 90 slots , distributed over 5 concentric rings , which can contain either fuel elements , graphite ( dummy ) elements , control rods or irradiation channels .",
    "the fuel consists of a uniform mixture of uranium ( 8% wt .",
    ", enriched 20% wt . in @xmath0u ) , zirconium ( 91% wt . ) and hydrogen ( 1% wt . ) .",
    "the fuel elements ( fes ) used in the current core configuration belong to different manufacturing series that were designed by general atomics over the years .",
    "the 101-type fes are characterized by aluminum cladding , 1:1 atomic ratio between zirconium and hydrogen and two burnable poison disks containing samarium .",
    "the 103-type and 104-type fes have stainless steel cladding , 1:1.6 zr  h ratio and a zirconium rod at the center of the fuel ; furthermore , a burnable poison disk containing molybdenum is present in the 104-type fes .        in the recent years , the triga mark ii reactor of pavia was characterized in detail by means of both neutron activation measurements in different irradiation facilities @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and development of proper simulation tools for modeling the neutronics , the dynamics and the thermal - hydraulics of the system @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "+ in particular , to study the reactor neutronics , we developed a monte carlo model based on mcnp5 @xcite .",
    "we chose this code thanks to its general geometry modeling capabilities , correct representation of neutron transport effects and continuous - energy cross section treatment .",
    "this model was extensively tested and validated by reproducing the experimental results obtained in 1965 , during the operations that followed the reactor first startup @xcite .",
    "this analysis included the reproduction of control rod calibration curves and the evaluation of the criticality coefficient ( @xmath1 ) in several reactor configurations both at low power ( @xmath2 w ) and full power ( 250 kw ) conditions  @xcite@xcite .",
    "+ in this initial configuration ( fig . [ fig_core ] )",
    "all the fuel elements were new and did not contain significant amounts of neutron poisons .",
    "therefore , in the mcnp5 simulations , we could model the fuel using the data of the original isotopic composition provided by the manufacturer .",
    "+ in this work , through the analysis of the fuel burnup , we aim to characterize the triga reactor in its present configuration , after many years of operation .",
    "moreover , this analysis is important to study the fuel cycle and determine the amount of long - lived radioactive waste which are produced in a reactor after a certain operating time .",
    "in order to characterize and model the current configuration of the triga mark ii reactor , we must take into account several aspects related to fuel burnup .",
    "first of all , the consumption of the fissile isotopes and the buildup of neutron poisons affects the system reactivity . therefore , in order to simulate the criticality condition of the reactor , it is crucial to know the fuel composition as function of time .",
    "moreover , since the fuel burnup is not homogeneous within the core , also the neutron fluxes and the power distributions change over time .",
    "in addition , we must consider that , during the operations of refueling and core reconfiguration , some fuel elements are replaced , added or moved to different locations . + for this reason , to evaluate the fuel composition as function of time , the whole history of the nuclear reactor must be followed , reproducing all the different configurations of the core and collecting the data concerning operating times and powers . + in order to analyze and simulate the fuel burnup in the triga mark ii reactor , we decided to develop a time evolution software which couples the historical data of reactor operating time and core configurations with the information about effective cross sections and neutron fluxes , evaluated through the mcnp5 model .",
    "this software was completely developed in - house to take into account some features that differentiate the experimental reactors from those used for power production , such as the daily on / off cycle and the long fuel lifetime .",
    "these effects are not negligible when properly accounting for neutron poison build - up in this kind of systems .",
    "+ the historical data about the critical configurations of the core can then be used as a benchmark for validating the mcnp5 model after each step of the burnup calculation . in this way , at the end of the simulation process , we aim to obtain a reliable and benchmarked simulation model for the current reactor configuration .",
    "the simulation model for the fuel burnup is based on the solution of a coupled set of differential equations , whose variables are the concentrations of all the isotopes in the fuel @xcite . although all the nuclear reactions and decays should be considered for an exact calculation of the fuel evolution , the main relevant processes to be modelled in order to ensure a good accuracy in the neutronics simulations are fission , neutron capture and radioactive decays .",
    "+ the isotopic concentration @xmath3 of a fission product species @xmath4 , characterized by @xmath5 decay constant and @xmath6 neutron absorption cross section , evolves in time according to this generic formula @xcite : + @xmath7    where the sum @xmath8 is performed over all fissionable nuclei , @xmath9 is the fission yield of isotope @xmath4 , @xmath10 is the macroscopic fission cross section , @xmath11 is the integral neutron flux intensity , @xmath12 is the decay rate of isotope @xmath13 to produce isotope @xmath4 and @xmath14 is the transmutation cross section for the production of isotope @xmath4 by neutron capture in isotope @xmath13 . + in order to take into account the reaction rate dependence on the neutron spectrum , the cross sections in eq .",
    "[ eq ] must be calculated as effective ones , i.e. average cross sections weighted by the energy distribution of the neutron flux .",
    "the time evolution of the elements belonging to the original fuel composition ( u , zr and h ) or produced exclusively through neutron capture can still be described by eq .",
    "[ eq ] by setting the fission yield value @xmath15 equal to 0 .",
    "+ equation [ eq ] must be integrated to determine fuel composition changes over its lifetime . in order to carry out this calculation ,",
    "however , the time dependence of the neutron flux must be known . to overcome this issue ,",
    "the 48 year period is divided in several time intervals in which the neutron flux distribution is assumed to vary negligibly . for the triga mark ii reactor , we verified , through dedicated mcnp5 simulations , that the time scale for significant flux changes is greater than the maximum operation time elapsed between two core reconfigurations ( @xmath163500 hours ) .",
    "particularly , we evaluated that the neutron flux variations due to the fuel burnup after @xmath17 hours at 250kw are less than @xmath18 in all the core positions . on the other hand",
    ", we also found that the neutron flux can vary more than @xmath19 after a core reconfiguration .",
    "for this reason , we carried out the burnup calculation using 27 time steps , one for each core reconfiguration occurred between 1965 and 2013 .",
    "+ the applied approximations are justified because their contribution has a smaller effect than the unavoidable uncertainties related to normal reactor operation ( for instance , continuous movement of the control rods ) . to further prove this statement , in section [ sec_bench ] we study the variation of @xmath1 over the course of the years , checking if our approximations introduce any kind of unwanted time dependence on the data .",
    "+ our software evaluates the time evolution of each fuel element by iterating the following procedure over all the time steps : +    1 .",
    "a mcnp5 simulation generates the neutron flux distribution in the reactor core .",
    "this simulation is performed by taking into account the thermal effects arising at full power ( 250kw ) and reproducing the original positions of the control rods @xcite ; 2 .",
    "flux spectra and endf / b - vii cross section data libraries are combined to evaluate the effective cross section for the isotopes of interest ; 3 .",
    "data about neutron fluxes , fission yields , cross sections , radioactive decay chains and reactor operating time are combined to calculate the new isotopic composition of the fuel elements , according to eq.[eq ] ; 4 .",
    "according to the new configuration , a new mcnp5 input file is prepared , where the fuel elements are simulated with the new isotopic composition and repositioned in the reactor core .    to simplify the problem solution",
    ", we applied some approximations :    1 .",
    "each fuel element was divided in 5 axial sections , to account for the uneven distribution of neutron flux over the vertical axis @xcite@xcite .",
    "configurations with more axial or radial sections were tested , but the results were found to be compatible within the model uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we chose to model 5 sections , thus saving computation time without losing accuracy .",
    "the list of all the fission products and trans - uranium elements to be included in the mcnp5 simulation was simplified , including only the isotopes impacting on the system neutronics in a non - negligible way ( tab .",
    "[ tab_isotopes ] ) .",
    "these isotopes were identified by calculating their absorption cross sections and the maximum concentrations they could reach in the triga reactor during 48 years of operation , which was purposely overestimated to be conservative . ] .",
    "these data were then compared to those of @xmath20xe , whose impact on @xmath1 is experimentally known , and an isotope was finally neglected if its maximum impact on @xmath1 was evaluated to be less than @xmath21 .",
    "each of the 27 time steps was divided in sub - intervals , to account for the reactor daily on / off cycle .",
    "since an accurate reconstruction of the real cycles was impractical , we chose 6 hour sub - intervals for the on condition and we calculated the duration of the off sub - steps to match the real time difference between the two reconfiguration dates .",
    "the calculation for @xmath20xe was carried out separately , due to its large daily variations ; its average concentration was estimated by considering a typical week in which the reactor operates 6 hours a day , from monday to friday .",
    ".list of the fission products , uranium trans - uranium isotopes included in the burnup calculation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the average @xmath1 value obtained by the simulations was    @xmath22 , +    which is in full agreement with the expected value @xmath23 .",
    "we developed an improved mcnp5 model for the triga mark  ii reactor in which the effects of fuel aging have been simulated .",
    "+ the effectiveness of the time evolution model was tested in multiple ways .",
    "the time profile of the @xmath1 value over the 48 years of operation shows no particular trend , indicating that no significant overestimation or underestimation of fuel burnup took place ; the average @xmath1 value over this time period , equal to @xmath24 , is compatible with the expected value of 1 .",
    "the regulating control rod calibration curve , measured on july 2013 , was reproduced completely and with good accuracy .",
    "a low power system configuration , dated 9 september 2013 , was simulated and led to results that , considering the systematic errors , are compatible with the experimental data .",
    "+ once the effectiveness of the simulation model was proven , its results were used as a tool to predict the effect of a core reconfiguration on the core excess value .",
    "the predicted ce was compatible , within @xmath25 , with the measured value ; moreover , the net ce increase following the reconfiguration was completely satisfactory and will allow the reactor to operate at full power for several more years .",
