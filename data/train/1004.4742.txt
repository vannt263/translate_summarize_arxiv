    "granular gases provide an appropriate context in which a number of fundamental issues related with non - equilibrium systems can be addressed .",
    "primary among these is the existence of a hydrodynamic description , i.e. of closed , deterministic equations for the hydrodynamic fields , identified as the number density @xmath0 , the flow velocity @xmath1 , and the ( granular ) temperature @xmath2 , in the case of one - component systems .",
    "a theoretical framework for deriving macroscopic equations from the underlying microscopic dynamics and investigating its range of validity is kinetic theory . in the low density limit ,",
    "the boltzmann equation for smooth and inelastic hard spheres or disks has been used to derive hydrodynamic equations for granular gases since many years ago @xcite .",
    "presently , explicit expressions for the transport coefficients appearing in the analogous of the navier - stokes equations are available , and they have been confirmed via direct monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the methods used are formal and do not address either the existence or the context of the hydrodynamic description itself , although internal mathematical consistency is accomplished at the level of the navier - stokes approximation , i.e. first order in the gradients of the hydrodynamic fluxes .",
    "for elastic hard spheres or disks , the problem has been satisfactorily solved by analyzing the spectrum of the linearized boltzmann operator @xcite . on the other hand , for the inelastic boltzmann equation ( ibe ) , although the hydrodynamic eigenfunctions and eigenvalues have been identified in the limit of large wave vectors @xcite , almost nothing is known about the kinetic , non - hydrodynamic part of the spectrum .",
    "consequently , the dominance of the hydrodynamic modes has not been established for the ibe , although it has been proven for some single - time relaxation model equations @xcite .    here",
    "the validity of a hydrodynamic description for granular gases will be addressed using a simplified ibe .",
    "specifically , the inelastic maxwell model ( imm ) will be employed @xcite .",
    "this kinetic equation is obtained from the ibe for hard spheres of disks by replacing the velocity dependent collision rate by an effective average value proportional to the thermal velocity .",
    "although other choices have also been considered @xcite , here the effective collision rate will be assumed to be also independent of the collision angle .",
    "moreover , attention will be restricted to the modes at asymptotically long wave lengths , i.e. to perturbations occurring also in homogeneous systems .",
    "this will suffice to establish that the hydrodynamic spectrum is not isolated from the rest at strong inelasticity , contrary to what is required for the existence of hydrodynamics .",
    "let @xmath3 be the one - particle distribution function of particles of mass @xmath4 with velocity @xmath5 at time @xmath6 .",

    "their perturbation for finite wavevectors ( gradients ) in the context of the inhomogeneous imm defines the hydrodynamic modes more generally .",

    "the hydrodynamic eigenfunctions span a @xmath65 dimensional subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "they are not orthogonal , as a manifestation of @xmath49 being non hermitian .",
    "then , the left hand eigenproblem @xmath66 has to be considered . in this equation",

    "although there seems to be no simple relationship between the functions @xmath62 and @xmath71 , the hydrodynamic part of the spectrum of @xmath67 has been found by simple inspection .",
    "the functions @xmath72 are solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 1.13 ] ) , corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath73 , @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "again , the eigenvalue @xmath74 is @xmath7-fold degenerate .",
    "moreover , it is easily verified that @xmath75 for the hydrodynamic eigenfunctions given by eqs .",
    "( [ 1.11 ] ) and ( [ 1.14 ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to get some information about the remaining , kinetic part of the spectrum of @xmath67 . here",
    "attention will be restricted to two eigenfunctions which have a clear physical interpretation .",
    "a direct evaluation gives @xmath76 it follows that @xmath77 is an eigenfunction of @xmath67 with eigenvalue @xmath78 .",
    "note that @xmath79 is proportional to the dynamical variable whose velocity average provides the pressure tensor @xcite .",
    "it is important to check whether the kinetic eigenvalue @xmath80 is actually separated from the hydrodynamic part of the spectrum , as required for the validity of the hydrodynamic description .",
    "note that if it is assumed that any function of the hilbert space can be expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions of @xmath49 , then the left eigenvalues are also right eigenvalues , i.e. there is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ 1.8 ] ) with @xmath81 .",
    "consequently , the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ 1.6 ] ) contains a contribution proportional to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the ( unknown ) eigenfunction of @xmath49 with eigenvalue @xmath81 , or a linear combination of eigenfunctions in the case of degeneracy .",
    "the validity of hydrodynamics requires that the above contribution decay faster than all the hydrodynamic modes , i.e. it must be @xmath84 ) , this condition is equivalent to @xmath85 with @xmath86 . for @xmath87",
    "this expression leads to an unphysical negative value of @xmath88 , while for @xmath89 it is @xmath90 .",
    "the above result suggests to check whether there is another left eigenfunction proportional to the dynamical variable providing the heat flux .",
    "one reason to consider these fluxes as candidates to be eigenfunctions of @xmath67 is that they are known to be orthogonal to the hydrodynamic modes @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "explicit evaluation gives that @xmath91 is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ 1.13 ] ) with @xmath92 the condition for the validity of hydrodynamics following from the existence of this kinetic mode is that @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , there is a finite value of the coefficient of normal restitution below which there is no time scale separation between the hydrodynamic and the kinetic parts of the distribution function .",
    "for @xmath89 it is @xmath94 and for @xmath87 @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the two kinetic eigenvalues @xmath80 and @xmath96 are compared with the slowest hydrodynamic mode @xmath97 for @xmath87 .",
    "( dotted lines ) and @xmath96 ( dashed lines ) , and the slowest hydrodynamic mode @xmath97 ( solid lines ) versus the coefficient of normal restitution @xmath19 for a system of inelastic maxwell molecules .",
    "note that the three modes are negative . ]",
    "the lack of dominance of the hydrodynamic modes over the mode related with the heat flux for long times , reflects itself in the calculation of the navier - stokes heat conductivity of an inelastic gas of maxwell molecules . as already mentioned",
    ", the form of the hydrodynamic spectrum for imm reported here is the same as for the ibe for hard spheres .",
    "the only difference is in the explicit expression of the distribution function of the hcs and in the value of the cooling rate .",
    "as a consequence , the formal expressions for the transport coefficients derived in @xcite from the ibe , can be directly applied to the case of maxwell molecules .",
    "then , the time - dependent heat conductivity @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 @xmath100 the existence of hydrodynamics to navier - stokes order requires that the correlation function @xmath101 decay to zero for @xmath102 .",
    "this clearly implies that @xmath103 , i.e. @xmath104 . consistently with this analysis , it is found that the heat conductivity for inelastic maxwell molecules obtained by the chapman - enskog procedure also diverges for @xmath105 @xcite .    to put the results reported here in a proper context some comments seem appropriate .",
    "( i ) it has been proven that the solution of the boltzmann equation for imm tends to the hcs for arbitrary initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the lack of time scale separation discussed here does not contradict this general property , since the obtained kinetic eigenvalues are negative , therefore leading to decaying in time contributions .",
    "( ii ) it is worth to stress that the failure of hydrodynamics in imm should not be understood as limited to the navier - stokes approximation , but to any closed description of the system in terms of the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "( iii ) of course , the value of @xmath19 for which the scale separation actually fails is not known , but only a lower bound has been determined .",
    "it seems sensible to expect higher limiting values of @xmath19 associated to eigenfunctions involving higher velocity powers .",
    "( iv ) on the other hand , there is no reason to expect a similar behavior for the ibe for hard spheres or disks . on the contrary",
    ", there are some indications that this is not the case .",
    "the expressions derived for the navier - stokes transport coefficients are regular functions of @xmath19 for @xmath20 @xcite , and the two kinetic modes considered here are not left eigenfunctions of the linearized inelastic boltzmann operator . actually , other relevant deep differences between the ibe and the imm have been found , as for instance the asymptotic decay of the distribution function of the hcs for large velocities @xcite ."
