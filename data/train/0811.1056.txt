    "high temperature superconductors have been addressed from a remarkable number of vantage points . nonetheless many of the basic questions still remain unresolved , and",
    "the notion of broken symmetries arising from a fermi liquid has been traditionally discarded in favor of many exotic ideas . here",
    "we revisit the fermi liquid concept and a particular broken symmetry in response to a class of recent quantum oscillation experiments .",
    "@xcite we and others  @xcite have had some success in this respect . if these theories and experiments are correct , one will have to radically alter our twenty year - old view of these superconductors .",
    "@xcite the totality of phenomenology can not of course be explained without serious fermi liquid corrections .",
    "but as long as the quasiparticle residue is finite , we hope that the low energy properties can be understood from our perspective .",
    "two paradoxes have arisen in the context of the quantum oscillation measurements .",
    "the first is the contrast between fermi arcs observed in angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments  @xcite on one hand and recent quantum oscillation experiments suggesting small fermi pockets in underdoped @xmath1 ( ybco ) ,  @xcite on the other .",
    "this is particularly clear in recent arpes experiments where an effort was made to examine ybco with similar doping as in the quantum oscillation measurements .",
    "@xcite    the second paradox is the non - existence of any evidence of the hole pockets in quantum oscillation measurements . within the density wave scenario of wave vector @xmath2 ( the lattice spacing set to unity ) , there should be two dominant frequencies in quantum oscillations .",
    "one corresponding to the electron pocket at about 500 t and the other corresponding to the hole pocket at around 900 t. these are of course rough numbers corresponding to approximately 10% doping , assuming that the luttinger sum rule is satisfied in the mixed state , that is , the quantum oscillations reflect the normal state even if the measurements may lie within the mixed state .",
    "the concept of a broken symmetry is very powerful because deep inside a phase a physically correct effective hamiltonian can address many important questions , whereas our inability to reliably predict properties of even a single band hubbard model , while widely pursued , has been a limiting factor .",
    "this is not an empty exercise , if new phenomena can be predicted or striking facts can be explained with some degree of simplicity . that broken symmetry both dictates and protects the nature of elementary excitations , determining the properties of matter , is important to emphasize .",
    "the suggested form of order , the @xmath0-density wave ( ddw ) ,  @xcite explains numerous properties of these superconductors , including the concomitant suppression of the superfluid density  @xcite , hall number ,  @xcite and more recently the large enhancement of nernst effect in the pseudogap state ,  @xcite in addition to the existence of a single - particle gap of @xmath3 form above @xmath4 .",
    "there are also theoretical reasons why ddw is a possibility .",
    "it competes favorably with other ordering tendencies in variational studies of extended hubbard models with nearest - neighbor repulsion and pair - hopping terms .",
    "@xcite it is also realized in a class of two - leg ladder models with nearest - neighbor repulsion.@xcite however , whatever form the correct hamiltonian takes , we know that it must favor @xmath0-wave superconductivity ( dsc ) .",
    "such a hamiltonian will almost certainly favor ddw order as well , in light of the abundance of local hamiltonians which do not discriminate between dsc and ddw order .",
    "in fact , two carefully designed difficult polarized neutron scattering experiments have provided tantalizing direct evidence of ddw order ,  @xcite although other experiments have claimed otherwise .",
    "@xcite    a natural enemy of the pristine properties of matter is disorder that is unavoidable in complex systems such as high temperature superconductors .",
    "the role of disorder was emphasized in the original proposal of ddw order as a relevant competing order in the phase diagram of high-@xmath5 superconductors ,  @xcite although our views of disorder have greatly evolved during the intervening years .",
    "it is this ddw order combined with disorder that would be the focus of the present manuscript in resolving the paradoxes stated above .",
    "the disorder considered are of two different types : ( 1 ) scattering due to impurities and defects and ( 2 ) scattering from vortices in the mixed states .",
    "we consider two kinds of intrinsic disoredr : ( a ) gaussian white noise and ( b ) correlated disorder with a finite correlation length . in the momentum space the scattering rate for correlated disorder will decay as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the momentum transfer between the initial and the final states , @xmath8 being the correlation length .",
    "therefore , because of its smaller size , the states corresponding to the electron pockets are scattered more than on the hole pockets .",
    "this is an interpretation of the phenomenon and is based on intrapocket scattering .",
    "an alternative interpretation involves the density of states on the fermi surface of the electron pockets .",
    "in contrast , for white noise , scattering is independent of momentum and affects both pockets similarly .",
    "disorder naturally has a strong effect on arpes spectral function , which is sensitive to the coherence factors that are analogs of wannier functions . in shubnikov - de haas oscillations it is only the averaged effect of disorder that enters by determining the effective lifetime on the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , the role of disorder is quite different , as we shall explicitly see .",
    "correlated disorder is also experimentally relevant . unlike quantum oscillation experiments which probes bulk properties ,",
    "arpes is inherently a surface probe . in the relevant case of ybco , as cleaved surfaces show that cuo and bao terminations give different contributions to the total photoemission intensity , with a hole doping @xmath9 , almost irrespective of the nominal bulk doping .",
    "this self - doping was controlled by evaporating potassium in situ on the cleaved surface , so as to reduce the hole content down to the value of underdoped bulk ybco ( @xmath10 ) ,  @xcite the doping level for which many quantum oscillation experiments are carried out .",
    "the potassium overlayer is likely to produce an effective correlated disorder in the @xmath11 plane .    to explain the second paradox we shall adapt an analysis of stephen  @xcite to include a normal state that exhibits ddw order .",
    "we shall see that the relativistic character of the nodal fermions of the hole pocket , as opposed to the nonrelativistic nature of the charge carriers of the electron pocket provides a possible explanation .",
    "if we denote the dingle factor of the electron pocket by @xmath12 , the dingle factor of the hole pocket is @xmath13",
    ". this huge suppression may be the resolution of the missing frequency from the hole pocket . here",
    ", @xmath14 is the cyclotron frequency corresponding to the electron pocket and @xmath15 is the scattering rate of the electrons from the vortices in the mixed state .",
    "the analysis of stephen also leads to a tiny shift of the relative frequency of the quantum oscillations in the mixed state , of the order of @xmath16 .",
    "thus , there is enough leeway that even a very large error in this estimate will not affect our conclusions .",
    "the organization of the manuscript is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we compute the arpes spectral function and show that disorder can destroy the evidence of electron pockets .",

    "v we briefly summarize the salient features of our work .",

    "in summary , we have shown that two of the most puzzling features in underdoped cuprates , the nonexistence of electron pockets in arpes and the lack evidence of the hole pockets in quantum oscillations can be plausibly resolved by considering correlated disorder and the vortex scattering rates in the mixed state .",
    "with respect to the latter , it is crucial that the nodal fermions are described by a relativistic spectrum while the quasiparticles corresponding to the electron pocket are described by a non - relativistic spectrum determined by the bottom of the band .",
    "it is important to determine if the calculation of stephen can be so closely taken over after modifying for the presence of nodal fermions .",

    "thus , even if the estimate is off by some orders of magnitude , we still have enough leeway .",
    "this argument has been recently challenged  @xcite in a calculation of the density of states , however .",
    "clearly , further investigations will be extremely valuable and are in progress .",
    "one of the surprising conclusions of the present work , which we believe is on firm grounds , is that even very strong disorder , such as white noise , has only a modest effect on quantum oscillations , while it has a much larger effect on the arpes spectra .",
    "this is because arpes spectral function depends on the coherence factors , which act as wannier functions that are naturally very sensitive to disorder . in quantum oscillations disorder",
    "appears primarily as an averaged lifetime in the dingle factor .",
    "elastic scattering has little direct effect on the onsager quantization condition .",
    "it is also a firm conclusion of our work that elastic disorder scattering from impurities can not be responsible for wiping out the hole pocket frequency , while keeping the electron pocket frequency more or less intact .",
    "in fact , quite the opposite seems to be true .",
    "thus , the vortex physics in the mixed state appears to be of paramount importance , especially the contrast between the non - relativistic electrons around the anti - nodal point and the relativistic nodal fermions at the nodal points of the brillouin zone .",

    "<S> recent quantum oscillation experiments in underdoped high temperature superconductors seem to imply two paradoxes . </S>",
    "<S> the first paradox concerns the apparent non - existence of the signature of the electron pockets in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second paradox is a clear signature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments , but no evidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the frequency of the electron pocket . </S>",
    "<S> this hole pockets should be present if the fermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave , assuming that luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number of charge carriers holds . </S>",
    "<S> here we provide possible resolutions of these apparent paradoxes from the commensurate @xmath0-density wave theory . to address the first paradox we have computed the arpes spectral function subject to correlated disorder , natural to a class of experiments relevant to the materials studied in quantum oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the spectral function is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate range of disorder correlation length , and typically less than half the hole pocket is visible , mimicking fermi arcs . </S>",
    "<S> next we show from an exact transfer matrix calculation of the shubnikov - de haas oscillation that the usual disorder affects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket . </S>",
    "<S> however , when , in addition , the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included , it wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if we are correct , it will be necessary to do measurements at higher magnetic fields and even higher quality samples to recover the hole pocket frequency . </S>"
