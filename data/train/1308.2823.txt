    "three neutrino mass and mixing scheme has been established as the solution to the lepton flavor violation observed in solar , atmospheric , reactor and long baseline accelerator neutrino data . within this scheme ,",
    "the neutrino oscillation depends on two mass splittings ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , three mixing angles ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and a cp - violating dirac phase , @xmath11 . throughout this letter",
    ", we will use the standard parametrization in @xcite for the three neutrino scheme .",
    "all the neutrino parameters entering neutrino oscillation formula have been measured except for the value of @xmath11 and sgn@xmath12 . to determine these last two parameters , studies and various plans are underway .",
    "there are however some anomalies that can not be explained within the present three neutrino scheme .",
    "the most famous examples are the @xmath13 and/or @xmath14 transitions in short baseline lsnd and miniboone experiments @xcite , reactor neutrino deficit @xcite and gallium anomaly @xcite .",
    "to explain these anomalies , various scenarios have been suggested among which arguably the most popular one is adding one or more sterile neutrino(s ) with mass splitting of order of o(1 ) ev@xmath3 with the active ones . with icecube atmospheric neutrino data ,",
    "this solution can be tested @xcite . for a comprehensive study of sterile neutrinos and model building issues ,",
    "@xcite .    within the standard lma msw solution to the solar puzzle",
    ", an upturn of the energy spectrum of events at energies below 8 mev is expected .",
    "however , data from sno , super - kamiokande and borexino experiments does not display such an upturn . in @xcite ,",
    "a scenario is proposed to explain the suppression of the upturn .",
    "the scenario is based on adding a new sterile neutrino which weakly mixes with the active neutrinos .",
    "the new mass eigenstate is called @xmath0 and its mass is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "to explain the suppression of the upturn in the low energy solar data , it is shown that @xmath16  ev@xmath3 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 determines the @xmath19 mixing in @xmath1 and/or @xmath20 .",
    "we refer to this scenario as ssns standing for superlight sterile neutrino scenario .",
    "notice however that the low energy solar neutrino data still suffers from large uncertainties and the suppression of the upturn is far from being established .",
    "borexino , kamland solar @xcite and sno+ @xcite will reduce the uncertainty .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that the ssns can be embedded within a concrete model .",
    "notice that in this scenario , @xmath21 . as a result , to test this scenario a long baseline setup such as the ones used to determine mass ordering can be employed . now that a relatively large value for @xmath22 is established by reactor experiments @xcite , new phases of these experiments are being studied to help determining the mass hierarchy .",
    "juno ( jiangmen underground neutrino observatory formerly known as daya bay ii ) @xcite and reno-50 @xcite experiments are specifically proposed for this purpose but can also be used for other measurements such as precision measurement of @xmath23 or studies of geoneutrinos @xcite .",
    "the baseline in these experiments are about 50 km , leading to @xmath24 so this setup is suitable to search for the effects of a sterile neutrino with @xmath25 . in this letter",
    ", we examine the ability of such long baseline reactor experiments in testing this scenario .",
    "we then study the dependence of the sensitivity to ssns on baseline to search for optimal setup to test the ssns .    in section",
    "ii , we describe the four neutrino scenario in which we are interested and outline its new parameters .",
    "we then summarize the bounds that already exist on the parameters . in section iii ,",
    "we describe the setups and the inputs for numerucal analysis . in section iv",
    ", we study oscillation pattern for ssns and present our results . in section",
    "v , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the four neutrino mixing matrix can be described by six mixing angles and three physical dirac phases .",
    "if the neutrinos are of majorana type , there will also be three majorana cp - violating phases which do not show up in the neutrino oscillation patterns .",
    "following the notation in @xcite , we call the mass eigenstates as @xmath26 with mass eigenvalues @xmath27 . the flavor eigenstates are related to mass eigenstates by a @xmath28 unitary matrix , @xmath29 as follows @xmath30 notice that @xmath0 is not necessarily the lightest state . in fact , ref . @xcite has shown that suppression of the upturn in low energy solar neutrino data implies @xmath31 .    there is a standard way of parameterizing the @xmath32 pmns matrix @xcite but there is not such a standard form for the parametrization of the @xmath33 mixing matrix",
    "to be compatible with the notation in @xcite , we use the following parametrization : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the standard @xmath32 pmns matrix and @xmath36 is the matrix mixing the sterile neutrino with active ones : @xmath37 to avoid the current bounds we take the mixing between @xmath19 and active neutrinos to be small . notice that @xmath18 and @xmath38 can be identified with the same parameters in @xcite . in the parameter range of our interest",
    "where @xmath39 , for intermediate baselines for which @xmath40 ( and therefore @xmath41 ) , @xmath18 and @xmath42 parameters can not be resolved .",
    "however , such experiments are sensitive to @xmath38 .",
    "the atmospheric data @xcite and long baseline experiment minos @xcite already constrain @xmath43 a stronger bound comes from cosmology .",
    "recent planck data constrains the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the recombination era , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath38 or @xmath42 are large enough , @xmath19 can reach thermal equilibrium at the early universe and can be considered as an extra degree of freedom , contributing @xmath45 . from this observation ,",
    "@xcite finds @xmath46 ( _ see _ also , @xcite ) .",
    "one should however remember that there is a deviation between the values of hubble constant derived from the planck data and from the local measurements .",
    "this discrepancy can be settled by an extra degree of freedom @xcite so the bounds found in ref .",
    "@xcite can be relaxed .",
    "the potential of reactor neutrino experiments with a baseline of @xmath47 50 km for determining the neutrino mass ordering has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main goal of juno and reno-50 experiments , which according to schedules @xcite will be ready for data taking in 2020 , is determining the sign of @xmath48 .",
    "for this purpose as we explain in the next section , high energy resolution is required .",
    "both detectors employ liquid scintillator and aim at an energy resolution of @xmath49 .",
    "it is shown that in order to determine sgn(@xmath8 ) , the difference between the distances of different reactors contributing to the flux of the detector should be less than 500 meters @xcite . considering this restriction , the best location for juno",
    "is found to be at a 52 km distance from xangjiang and taishan reactor complexes @xcite .",
    "the daya bay reactor , which is the main contributor to the flux of the current daya bay i experiment , is located at a distance of 215 km and the planned huizhou reactor will be 265 km away .",
    "the combined power of the two close reactor complexes is 36 gw . the flux from the far reactors is a troublesome background for the purpose of determining the hierarchy ; however , as we shall discuss in the next section for probing the ssns , the flux from the far sources will also be helpful . the juno setup will not have a near detector so the flux normalization uncertainty will be around 3 % . as we shall discuss in the next section",
    "this uncertainty will not be a problem for probing the ssns . for our analysis",
    ", we use the baselines and powers listed in table 1 of @xcite for juno .",
    "the reno-50 setup uses the same reactor used for the current reno experiment .",
    "the baseline for reno-50 will be 47 km .",
    "the total power is 16.4 gw . the near detector can be used to measure the total flux so the flux normalization uncertainty can be reduced to 0.3% @xcite . in principle , the kamland data could be also used for testing the ssns . while the total @xmath50 flux at kamland is comparable to that in juno or reno-50 , the new detectors are larger by one order of magnitude .",
    "we therefore focus on the juno and reno-50 experiments and do not consider the kamland results .",
    "we use the globes software @xcite implementing four neutrino scheme @xcite for our analysis .",
    "we take 20  kton ( 18  kton ) scintillator detector for juno ( reno-50 ) experiment .",
    "we assume energy resolution equal to @xmath51 , and 62 bins are considered from 1.8 mev to 8 mev .",
    "we employ the energy spectrum for the reactor neutrino as shown in @xcite .",
    "the cross section of neutrinos is taken from @xcite .",
    "we take the uncertainties as well as the best fit values of the parameters of the three - neutrino scheme from @xcite .",
    "we use the pull - method to account for the uncertainties in the parameters of the three neutrino mass scheme .",
    "we take the ordering of the mass eigenstates to be normal and set @xmath52 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the main sources of background are ( i ) accidental background ; ( ii ) @xmath53 background and ( iii ) geoneutrino background .",
    "we take the spectrum of these sources of background from @xcite and normalize each background flux as described in @xcite .",
    "the energy of the reactor neutrinos is of order of a few mev . at such energies matter effects on the oscillation probability",
    "are negligible : @xmath54 .",
    "the oscillation probability can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the absence of mixing with the sterile neutrinos , we recover the standard formula : @xmath58 the interference of the second and third terms in the oscillation formula ( given by @xmath59 ) is sensitive to sgn@xmath12 . to determine the hierarchy , the oscillatory mode given by @xmath60 has to be resolved which requires excellent energy resolution @xcite .",
    "moreover , to resolve this mode , the difference between the distances of different sources should be smaller than the oscillation length associated with @xmath8 ; otherwise , averaging effects will wash out the sensitivity to the sign . in eq .",
    "( [ os ] ) , there are four oscillatory modes ( proportional to @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and constant ) which are in principle enough to determine all the parameters entering eq .",
    "( [ os ] ) , even without the knowledge of the total normalization of the flux .",
    "notice that the cp - violating phase @xmath11 and mixing angle @xmath10 do not enter eq .",
    "( [ os ] ) so unlike the case of long baseline experiments , here the derivation of sign(@xmath64 ) will not suffer from ambiguity induced by the octant or @xmath11 degeneracy .",
    "the matter effects will cause a deviation of effective mixing angles and mass splittings from the vacuum values of order of 1 % . for the purpose of the precision measurement of @xmath23 and @xmath7 ,",
    "matter effects have to be taken into account but for our analysis , we can safely neglect the matter effects .",
    "let us now discuss the effects of each mixing by the sterile neutrino one by one . in the end , we will discuss the case when all mixings are nonzero .    1 .",
    "_ case i , @xmath65 and @xmath66 _ : in this limit , the oscillation probability can be written as @xmath67 + by measuring the frequency and amplitude of the oscillatory modes @xmath68 and/or @xmath69 , the values of @xmath18 and @xmath70 can be determined . notice that to derive these parameters a moderate precision in knowledge of the flux normalization as well as the energy reconstruction resolution will be enough . in other words , the results will not be sensitive to uncertainty in flux normalization or energy resolution . since sgn(@xmath8 ) and",
    "@xmath71 are determined by completely separate oscillatory modes , the presence of the mixing @xmath18 does not affect the determination of sgn(@xmath72 . as expected in the @xmath73 limit , the sensitivity to @xmath18 is lost .",
    "[ alpha - bound ] shows the bound that juno and reno-50 experiments with 5 years of data taking can impose on @xmath18 . to draw this figure ,",
    "we have set @xmath74 and have varied the true value of @xmath70 using the globes software @xcite . for given @xmath70",
    "the value of @xmath75 shown by curves can be distinguished from @xmath76 at 95 % c.l .",
    "the blue ( thin ) , red ( intermediate ) and cyan ( thick ) curves correspond respectively to the reno-50 , juno and combined juno and reno-50 results after 5 years of data taking .",
    "as expected for @xmath77 ev@xmath3 , the bound on @xmath75 becomes weaker .",
    "we also draw plots ( not shown here ) displaying the minimum @xmath78 that can be distinguished from @xmath79 .",
    "that is we varied the `` true '' values of @xmath70 and @xmath18 , plotting the value of @xmath80 versus @xmath70 for which @xmath81 can be distinguished from it by 95 % c.l . as expected the results",
    "were only slightly different from those shown in fig .  1 .",
    "[ alpha - bound ] shows that as @xmath82 , the sensitivity to @xmath78 becomes weaker .",
    "moreover at this point , the three curves converge . from eq ( [ os -",
    "a ] ) , it is straightforward to verify that as @xmath83 , the effect of @xmath18 can be mimicked by a small shift in @xmath23 .",
    "thus , in this limit the bound on @xmath78 is determined by the uncertainty in @xmath23 : @xmath84 . since the effects of @xmath22 are already subdominant",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath22 does not affect the sensitivity to @xmath18 and other new mixing parameters .",
    "we have checked this statement by turning off the uncertainty of @xmath22 and @xmath23 one by one . while the uncertainty in @xmath22 seems to be irrelevant , setting the uncertainty in @xmath23 equal to zero",
    ", we lose the feature at @xmath85 .",

    "@xmath86 renders the experiment unable to constrain @xmath18 for @xmath87 ev@xmath3 .",
    "[ alpha - l ] shows the bound that can be derived on @xmath78 versus baseline for a reactor with 36 gw power and 20 kton detector . for any other values of power and the detector size",
    ", the dependence on baseline should be similar but the curves can be shifted up or down . it is noteworthy that there is a local minimum close to 50 km ( close to the baseline of juno as well as that of reno-50 ) which makes these setups close to ideal for the purpose of probing the ssns . for @xmath88 ev@xmath3 , the performance of a setup with baseline farther than 200 km is better .",
    "thus , the daya bay or huizhou reactors or other farther reactor sources contributing to the flux at juno can be even more helpful than the closer sources for probing the ssns .",
    "considering eq .",
    "( [ os - a ] ) , this is understandable because to discern @xmath80 , @xmath89 should be sizeable .",
    "case ii , @xmath90 and @xmath91 _ : in this limit , @xmath92 a discussion similar to case i holds here , too .",
    "the only difference is that for @xmath93 , the sensitivity to @xmath42 is limited by @xmath94 but the sensitivity is lost when @xmath95 regardless of the uncertainty in @xmath96 .",
    "[ gamma - bound ] displays the bound that juno and reno-50 experiments with 5 years of data taking can impose on @xmath42 . as expected at @xmath97 , the sensitivity to @xmath98 is lost .",

    "independently of @xmath70 , the optimal baseline is located close to 50 km which means the juno and reno-50 setups , despite being designed for another purpose , are close to optimal setup for probing snss , too . unlike the case i",
    ", here there is no other minimum for smaller @xmath70 .",
    "that is because to discern @xmath104 , @xmath89 need not to be sizeable .",

    "ii , sensitivity to @xmath109 persists even in the limit @xmath93 so setups with longer baselines have no advantage .",
    "increasing the baseline , the sensitivity to the ssns deteriorates because of the flux decrease .",
    "similarly to the cases i and ii , to derive @xmath108 from these modes a moderate precision in the flux normalization and a moderate energy resolution to reconstruct the modes given by @xmath70 are sufficient .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillatory @xmath110 and @xmath111 terms here are suppressed by @xmath112 . for @xmath113 ,",
    "this suppression is negligible and sgn(@xmath8 ) can be derived , like in the standard case . from eq .",
    "( [ os - b ] ) , we observe that the sensitivity to @xmath114 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath115 .",
    "thus , as shown in fig .",

    "the following comments are in order :    * as seen from figures [ alpha - bound ] , [ gamma - bound ] and [ beta - bound ] the performance of juno is overally better than reno-50 .",
    "the main reason is that the power of juno is considerably larger than that of reno-50 .",

    "( [ os - a],[os - g],[os - b ] ) as well as in eq .",
    "( [ peebb ] ) , which is given by @xmath121 is already sensitive to the sign of @xmath70 even though matter effects are suppressed .",
    "* since the information on new mixing angles come from the oscillating modes with a oscillation length much larger than 1  km , unlike the case of deriving the sign(@xmath8 ) , here the distance difference between the different sources contributing to the flux is not a cause of concern .",
    "* in the above cases , none of the cp - violating phases appear in @xmath122 .",
    "however , when two or more mixing angles are nonzero , the dirac cp - violating phases show up in @xmath122 .",

    "( [ peebb ] ) can be extracted .",
