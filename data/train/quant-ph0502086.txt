    "the idea of using quantum systems for processing information has been suggested by r.  p.  feynman as a potential way of bypassing the difficulty of simulating quantum physics with classical computers . since then",
    ", it has developed into an exciting research area with implications ranging from cryptography ( see e.g.  @xcite ) to complexity theory ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for instance , quantum computers could solve efficiently some hard problems such as integer factorization  @xcite , or give quadratic speed - up over optimal classical algorithms , as it is the case for unsorted database search  @xcite .",
    "however , for taking advantage of the quantum nature of physical systems to process information , it is necessary to protect them from unwanted evolutions . indeed ,",
    "if quantum registers are not protected from noise , the very fragile superpositions required for efficiently manipulating quantum information tend to disappear exponentially fast with the number of qubits involved . this effect",
    "  called decoherence   can nonetheless be reduced by using quantum error correcting codes .",
    "the first scheme of this kind has been proposed in 1995 by p.  shor  @xcite , and triggered numerous work on quantum error correction .",
    "most notable , was the introduction of the stabilizer formalism  @xcite   for defining quantum codes and finding the gate implementation of encoding and decoding circuits   together with the class of css codes  @xcite . with these tools at hand , it has been shown that quantum information processing can be done fault - tolerantly ( see for instance @xcite ) , i.e. would be feasible even in the presence of qubit errors and gate faults   provided these events are rare enough .    in spite of these important results ,",
    "properties of quantum codes are less understood than those of for their classical counterparts .",
    "it is thus of interest to tackle the problem from a pragmatic point of view : devise versatile constructions of quantum codes inspired by the best classical codes , and analyze their performances .",
    "when sending classical information over memoryless classical channels , it has been demonstrated that a very efficient way for approaching the channel capacity is obtained by using ldpc codes with gallager s iterative decoding algorithm .",
    "generalizing these notions to quantum codes seems a promising way , and has indeed been proposed recently  @xcite . in this work , d.  j.  c.  mackay _ et al . _",
    "have shown how to construct sparse weakly self - dual binary codes that can be used to construct quantum ldpc codes using calderbank - shor - steane s method .",
    "our work is aimed at finding other constructions of quantum ldpc codes within the stabilizer formalism .",
    "while a brief introduction to stabilizer codes is provided below , we would like to pinpoint here the main difficulty for finding ldpc stabilizer codes .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , each stabilizer code can be viewed as a code over @xmath0 , the field with four elements .",
    "however , the converse is not true : to correspond to valid stabilizer codes , these codes must be self - orthogonal for some hermitian trace inner product .",
    "fulfillment of this peculiar constraint makes usual constructions of ldpc codes useless in the quantum setting .",
    "our work provides a partial solution to this problem by defining such codes through simple group theoretical constructions ( see sections [ sec : generic ] and [ sec:4_8 ] ) .",
    "the resulting codes can be viewed as quantum analogs of regular gallager codes : each qubit is involved in the same number of parity - check equations , and each parity - check equation involves the same number of qubits .",
    "error estimation has been performed by an iterative algorithm applied to a tanner graph associated to our constructions .",
    "the results of these numerical simulations are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",

    "can be done in many different ways , a particularly useful method is known as the stabilizer formalism .",
    "the definition of stabilizer codes relies heavily on properties of pauli matrices for one qubit , i.e. acting on @xmath7 : @xmath8 in particular , these matrices square to the identity ; they generate a finite multiplicative group @xmath9 ; and any pair @xmath10 of elements in @xmath9 either commutes ( @xmath11 ) or anti - commutes ( @xmath12 ) .    by extension ,",

    "it is well known that the most general transformation on @xmath4 qubits allowed by quantum mechanics is a completely positive trace preserving map . however , as shown in @xcite , it is sufficient to consider errors as elements of @xmath13 since any admissible quantum operation can be written in kraus form using only elements of the pauli group over @xmath4 qubits .",

    "the action of @xmath27 on @xmath17 is either to map @xmath17 onto itself , or to map @xmath17 onto an orthogonal subspace of @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the measurement associated to the @xmath21 s reveals onto which orthogonal subspace @xmath17 has been mapped : the @xmath20 dimensional binary vector @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 , characterizes @xmath33 , and is called the syndrome of @xmath27 .    also note that not all errors @xmath27 with @xmath34 are harmful .",

    "such @xmath43 is called the estimated error . the most common error model considered in the literature",
    "is the depolarizing channel where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 errors occur each with probability @xmath47 , and independently on each qubit .",

    "this duality is due to the additive structure of @xmath0 which echoes the multiplicative structure of the pauli operators @xmath53 .",
    "the mapping between one and the other is the following : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , with the trace operation @xmath58 , it can be checked that @xmath59 is @xmath60 iff the pauli operators associated to @xmath61 and @xmath62 commute and @xmath63 iff they anti - commute .",
    "this motivates the definition of the following inner product over @xmath64 : @xmath65    the generators of a stabilizer code , when expressed as row - vectors of @xmath64 , form a matrix @xmath66 which will be called a parity - check matrix of the stabilizer code . in what follows ,",
    "both the @xmath26-th generator defining the stabilizer code and its expression as the @xmath26-th row of @xmath66 are denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "these rows are orthogonal with respect to the inner product defined above .",
    "the converse is also true : any @xmath67 matrix over @xmath0 with orthogonal rows defines a stabilizer code over @xmath4 qubits .",
    "while stabilizer codes were originally introduced using the language of the pauli group , we will mainly employ the @xmath0 formalism .",
    "this choice simplifies the notation , and better points out analogies and differences in constructing classical and quantum ldpc codes .",
    "interested readers are redirected to @xcite for a more complete treatment of stabilizer codes such as gate implementation and additional connections between stabilizer codes and codes over @xmath0 .",
    "according to the definition of a parity - check matrix for stabilizer codes , it is natural to introduce quantum ldpc codes as stabilizer codes with sparse parity - check matrix :    an @xmath68-regular quantum ldpc code is a stabilizer code whose parity - check matrix @xmath66 has `` @xmath61 '' non - zero entries per column and `` @xmath62 '' non - zero entries per row .    in the rest of this article",
    "we are going to construct and analyze some @xmath68-regular ldpc codes .      to define the iterative error estimation algorithm we use the following tanner graph associated to a parity check matrix @xmath66 .",
    "it is a bipartite graph with vertex set @xmath69 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath70 are associated to qubits of the code ( i.e. columns of @xmath66 ) and vertices of @xmath71 to the generators of the stabilizer code ( i.e. rows of @xmath66 ) .",

    "we label this edge with the entry @xmath74 .",
    "the purpose of the iterative error estimation algorithm is to find the most likely value for each @xmath75 such that @xmath76 is compatible with the observed syndrome @xmath77 .",
    "the local constraint on @xmath43 associated to the @xmath78-th check node ( i.e. vertices in @xmath71 ) is given by the equation @xmath79    this graph is nothing but the syndrome version of a tanner graph .",
    "the algorithms we can use to estimate errors are the sum - product or the min - sum algorithms in their syndrome decoding form applied to this graph .",
    "that is , the version of these algorithms which estimates the most likely value of the error for each qubit given the observed syndrome .",
    "note that iterative decoding of classical codes estimates instead the most likely value of the codeword symbols for each bit of the code .      in order to construct quantum ldpc codes",
    "we restrict our attention to codes having a parity check matrix @xmath66 with two kinds of non zero entries , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we start our construction by choosing a group @xmath82 with cardinality equal to a multiple of the length of the code we are interested in .",
    "then we choose two subgroups @xmath83 and @xmath84 of @xmath82 , with @xmath85 .",
    "the cosets @xmath86 are associated to qubits whereas the cosets @xmath87 are associated to rows of the parity - check matrix . in other words",
    "the length @xmath4 and the number of rows @xmath20 in the parity check matrix are given by @xmath88 we then pick a set of generators @xmath89 of @xmath82 that can be partitioned into two sets @xmath90 such that the following properties are satisfied : @xmath91    we put an edge between coset @xmath86 and coset @xmath87 iff there exists @xmath92 such that @xmath93 , or equivalently iff there exist @xmath94 , @xmath95 such that @xmath96 .",

    "this is a simple consequence of the following lemma :    [ lem : easy ] the intersection of a coset @xmath86 and @xmath87 is either empty or equal to a coset @xmath102 .",
    "this defines the tanner graph of our code and therefore also its parity - check matrix @xmath66 .",
    "property ( [ eq : simple_edge ] ) imposes that there are no multiple edges in the graph .",
    "the point of this construction is that the commutation of the @xmath103 s with the @xmath104 s implies the orthogonality of the rows of @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the matrix @xmath66 is a valid parity - check matrix for defining a stabilizer code .",
    "the parity - check matrix @xmath66 associated to the tanner graph given by this construction has orthogonal rows .",
    "given two rows @xmath21 and @xmath105 of @xmath66 , a parity - check matrix of a stabilizer code , one can partition the set of qubits in two classes : qubits for which the corresponding entries in @xmath21 and @xmath105 have inner product @xmath60 , and those for which the entries have inner product @xmath63 . for @xmath21 and @xmath105 to be orthogonal ,",
    "it is necessary and sufficient that the number of qubits of the second type is even .",
    "equivalently , and this is how our construction is tailored , we must show that qubits of the second type can be paired together .    consider a qubit belonging to the second class",
    "; say it corresponds to the vertex @xmath86 and the rows @xmath21 and @xmath105 correspond to the cosets @xmath87 and @xmath106 . since for this qubit the entries of @xmath21 and @xmath105",
    "have inner product @xmath63 , one of these two rows has a @xmath80 at the position of @xmath86 and the other one has a @xmath81 . without loss of generality",
