    "much attention has been devoted in the past years to the study of heat conduction in low - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "such study is not only important for understanding the fundamentals of statistical mechanics , but also for potential applications in heat control and management in nanoscale devices .",
    "indeed , various models for thermal rectifiers / diodes that allow heat to flow easily in one direction have been proposed @xcite . moreover ,",
    "based on the phenomenon of the _ negative differential thermal resistance _ ( @xmath0 ) observed in nonlinear lattices , a theoretical model for  thermal transistor \" is also proposed @xcite , which allows us to control heat current ( due to phonons ) by adjusting the temperature of the gate terminal ( or called  gate temperature \" ) .",
    "this is similar to the electronic transistor which controls the electric current by adjusting the gate voltage .",
    "we should point out that our  thermal transistor \" is different from the recent  heat transistor \" , which controls the heat flux ( caused by electrons ) via adjusting the gate voltage @xcite .",
    "most recently , based on the thermal transistor , the different thermal logic gats have been also realized theoretically@xcite , which means that the phonons , the heat carrier , can also be used to carry information and processed accordingly .",
    "the purpose of the current paper are two folds .",
    "first , we shall discuss how to improve significantly the switching efficiency of 1d thermal transistor ; second , we shall extend the study from 1d model to 2d which is closer to laboratory fabricated materials .",
    "the 1d thermal transistor model consists of three segments @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 and each segment is a frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) lattice @xcite .",
    "the model configuration , which is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , is similar to the one proposed in ref.@xcite except for an additional interface coupling @xmath4 . in each segment , we regard the particle that is coupled to heat bath as the first particle and the interface particle as the last particle .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the 1d model writes @xmath5and the hamiltonian of each segment can be written as @xmath6=@xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the displacement from equilibrium position and the conjugate momentum of the @xmath10 particle in segment @xmath11 , where @xmath11 stands for @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the harmonic spring constant and the on - site potential of the fk lattice .",
    "we couple the last particle of segment @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 to particle @xmath14 via harmonic springs .",
    "thus @xmath15=@xmath16 .",
    "fixed boundaries are used , i.e. , @xmath17=0 and each segment consists of 10 particles .",
    "= 0.01 , @xmath18=5.00 , @xmath19=0.35 , @xmath4=0.30 ; @xmath20=0.20 , @xmath21=1.00 , @xmath22=0.20 , @xmath23=0.05 ; @xmath24=5.00 , @xmath25=1.00 , @xmath26=0.20 , and @xmath27=5.00 .",
    "( c ) thermal modulator : all parameters remain the same as in ( b ) except with @xmath26=0.05 . ]    in our simulations , we use the nos - hoover heat baths @xcite and we set the mass of each particle and the boltzmann constant to unity unless otherwise stated . in the nonequilibrium stationary state , the heat flux , which is the rate of energy transport , is constant along each segment and the local equilibrium temperature is given by the time average of the square of particle s velocity per degree of freedom .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 that the model described by hamiltonian ( 1 ) can display different heat controlling features depends on the applied gate temperature , @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , the model can act as a heat switch , namely , the system can be switched from a heat insulator to a heat conductor by just adjusting the gate temperature . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "1(b ) , when @xmath28 is at 0.01 , 0.08 , and 0.14 , @xmath29@xmath30@xmath31 , thus @xmath32=0 , namely , the control terminal does not provide any current to the system , the system , however is switched from an insulating ( off ) state , to a semi - conducting ( semi - on ) state , and conducting ( on ) state . at these three points ,",
    "@xmath33 are 3.8x@xmath34 , 1.8x@xmath35 , and 3.2x@xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the ratio of @xmath36 at the  on \" state to that at the  off \" state is considered as the switching efficiency which is about 800 .",
    "we further demonstrate that the model can act as a heat modulator as well in which @xmath36 can be continuously modulated by the gate temperature . to show this",
    ", we recall that for any two weakly coupled lattices , the heat current depends among others , on the strength of the interface coupling used @xcite .",
    "thus , to have @xmath37@xmath38@xmath39 , we can reduce the strength of @xmath26 so that the heat flow through the control terminal decreases . apparently , @xmath26 should not be too small otherwise @xmath40 is not well - controlled by @xmath28 .",
    "the numerical result is shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) . in our next configuration",
    ", we replace segment _",
    "d _ with a fpu-@xmath41 lattice whose phonon spectrum is contributed by low frequency vibrations ( acoustic phonons ) only .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath42=@xmath43 , with @xmath41 being the anharmonicity .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2(a ) that such a setup reduces the heat current at  off \" state greatly but affects the heat current at  on \" state only slightly with the switching of about 1300 , where @xmath33 equals to 2.15x@xmath34 and 2.82x@xmath35 at @xmath28=0.01 and 0.14 , respectively .",
    "it can be noticed that for this and the former lattice choice in the present model , @xmath36 at the  off \" and  on \" state is about @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , with a switching of about @xmath44 , this is a significant improvement compared with previous one @xcite .",
    "the high switching is mainly a result of the significant reduction of @xmath36 at the  off \" state , which is basically due to the lower @xmath45 at `` off '' state ( in the previous work it is designed at 0.04 ) .",
    "moreover , we found that using lattice with lower heat resistance as terminal _",
    "d _ is ideal for achieving a large @xmath37 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we show the heat modulating effect with the same setup .",
    "since the demonstrated features of the transistor rely very much on an efficient control of the interface temperature , it would be interesting also to study how the property of the control terminal can affect its functions . in fig .",
    "3 , we show that when we use the fpu-@xmath41 lattice as the control segment , due to the large heat resistance in the segment , temperature @xmath45 does not well follow @xmath46 thus heat currents in segment @xmath1 and @xmath2 do not sensitively depend on @xmath46 in the low temperature regime . only when @xmath28@xmath47 0.08 , significant increment of currents and continuous modulation of @xmath36 are observed . in other words , @xmath36 can be even more precisely adjusted",
    ".     lattice with @xmath22(=@xmath48)=0.20 and @xmath41=0.05 is used as segment _",
    "d_. other parameters remain the same as in fig . 1 ( b ) .",
    "( b ) thermal modulator : all parameters remain the same as in 2 ( a ) except with @xmath4=0.25 , @xmath23=0.055 , and @xmath26=0.04 . ]     and the fpu-@xmath41 lattices are used as segment @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the system parameters are @xmath51=0.01 , @xmath18=5.00 , @xmath19=0.35 , @xmath4=0.60 ; @xmath20=0.20 , @xmath52=0.20 , @xmath53=0.05 , @xmath23=0.05 ; @xmath54=0.20 , @xmath55=2.00 , @xmath26=0.20 , and @xmath27=5.00 . ]",
    "the results presented so far have shown that by choosing the lattice in different segment appropriately , one can improve the switching and modulating efficiency significantly .",
    "this message is very important and useful for optimization and experimental realization of the thermal transistor . in the following",
    ", we shall extend the study of the thermal transistor to 2d .",
    "such extension is important in application , as it takes into account the interaction between longitudinal and transverse motions and therefore is closer to real material such as thin film _",
    "etc_. however , it is not our intention here to look for optimum switching/ modulating condition for this model .",
    "the displacement from equilibrium position and the momentum of a particle in 2d lattice are labeled as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the relative separation between two particles is @xmath58=@xmath59=@xmath60 .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model consists of the hamiltonian of each segment : @xmath61,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the hamiltonian of the interface : @xmath62.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly , all segments are coupled to each other via harmonic springs . in our model , segments @xmath63 and @xmath50 are fk lattices and segment @xmath49 is fpu-@xmath41 lattice .",
    "thus , @xmath64(@xmath58)=@xmath65@xmath66 , @xmath67=@xmath68+@xmath69 , @xmath70=0 , and @xmath71=@xmath72 .",

    "periodic and fixed boundaries are used in the y ( transverse ) and x ( longitudinal ) direction respectively , namely , @xmath74=@xmath75 and @xmath76=(0 , @xmath77 ) for @xmath77=@xmath78 .",
    "thus the topologies of the segments , as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , are cylinders .",
    "nos - hoover heat baths are coupled to the ends of segment ( @xmath79=1 ) . in the stationary state ,",
    "temperature gradients are set up in the @xmath80 direction and thus only heat currents through longitudinal links , @xmath81(=@xmath82 ) need to be taken into account , which are constant along each segment .",

    "( c ) thermal modulator with @xmath51=0.015 . here , @xmath83=@xmath84=10 , @xmath85=9 , and @xmath86=4 .",
    "]    in fig .",
    "4(b ) , we show the heat switching for the 2d thermal transistor model . it can be seen that when @xmath28 is at 0.01 and 0.07 , @xmath39@xmath30@xmath37 and @xmath87=0 . at these two points ,",
    "@xmath36 are 8.43x@xmath88 and 3.38x@xmath35 respectively and thus the switching efficiency is about 4 .",
    "this is a significant reduction when compared with the 1d case and this scenario is also quite similar to the 2d thermal rectifier @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4(c ) that when @xmath51 is increased , the difference between @xmath39 and @xmath37 is reduced , which gives a better modulation of @xmath36 by the gate temperature . it is worth mentioning that in 2d case",
    ", the crossover energy , particles above which are able to overcome the on - site potential barrier is much lower than that in 1d case .",
    "thus the lattice parameters should be re - designed , otherwise the switching efficiency is reduced significantly as shown above .",
    "in summary , we have provided several ways in improving the switching efficiency in 1d thermal transistor , namely , one can change different lattice in different segments , and/or by adjusting the coupling strength at the interface .",
    "our study has been extended to two - dimensional lattices and a prototype of 2d thermal transistor - a tube - like model have been proposed .",
    "our numerical simulations have demonstrated that such a prototype can work as a heat switch and a heat modulator - two basic functions of a thermal transistor .    in our numerical simulations , we have used dimensionless units for the sake of computations .",
    "however , all dimensionless units are related to the dimensional physical variables through dimensional scaling and consequently , the physical ( real ) temperature @xmath89 is related to the numerical temperature _ t _ through @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the boltzmann constant ( please refer to @xcite for details ) .",
    "suppose we use single - walled carbon nanotube as our experimental prototype for the thermal transistor model , namely with the mass of particle @xmath92 , lattice constant @xmath93 , and natural oscillation frequency @xmath94 correspond to the real values of such a material @xcite , @xmath95=0.01 in our simulations corresponds to physical temperature @xmath89 of about @xmath96 k. similar analysis for heat flux gives @xmath97 ( = @xmath98 ) @xmath99@xmath88@xmath100 .",
    "therefore , with @xmath100 @xmath99@xmath35 , @xmath97 is about @xmath101 w ( j / s ) which is smaller than that one in ref.@xcite .",
    "the smaller heat flux obtained in our model is not surprising .",
    "it is mainly due to the interacting with external on - site potential @xcite and the interface thermal resistance arises in coupling dissimilar nonlinear lattices @xcite , which is similar to the case of electronic diode where the electrical current are greatly reduced by the p - n junction . for a homogeneous fpu lattice with similar parameters , @xmath97 can be about 2 orders of magnitude higher .    even though a real working prototype for solid state thermal transistor is still an open issue , we believe that the above model or its variants will be realized sooner or later",
    ". moreover , a solid state thermal rectifier using nanotubes has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite ( see also ref@xcite for other variants ) .",
    "more recently , a tunable and reversible thermal link using multi - walled carbon nanotubes ( mwcnts ) @xcite were successfully demonstrated whereby the thermal conductance can be controlled mechanically by displacing the outer shell with respect to the inner one .",
    "this is a step forward to the realization of thermal transistor .",
    "in fact , in the heat control models , be it a thermal rectifier or a thermal transistor , the key factors are : ( 1 ) the broken of the spatial symmetry of terminal , namely they are two different materials ; ( 2 ) nonlinearity in each segment .",
    "therefore , the possible material to be used for the thermal transistor might be multiwalled nanotubes . as the recent experiment @xcite shows that the outer wall can be used to control the thermal conductance of the nanotube , thus it can be used as the controlling terminal g.",
