    "conformal symmetry tends to emerge in pure ( homogeneous and rotationally invariant ) 2-d statistical mechanics models at their critical points .",
    "this high degree of symmetry severely constrains these theories , so that these critical points are well understood .",
    "many models , including the ising model , tricritical ising model , and tricritical three - state potts model , are part of a class of conformal field theories known as virasoro minimal models  @xcite .",
    "the ising model  @xcite , tricritical ising model  @xcite , and tricritical three - state potts model  @xcite have all been realized experimentally in adsorbed monolayer systems .    because physical systems always have impurities , it is important to consider the effect of quenched disorder on the critical behavior of these theories . when disorder is added to the bulk , random fields are usually relevant , but random bonds may or may not be ( see e.g. ref.s  @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to show , for certain systems , that with the addition of disorder the system renormalizes into an infra - red fixed point .",
    "in fact , a rigorous theorem shows that when disorder in the order parameter is added to a system undergoing a first - order phase transition , the latent heat vanishes  @xcite , and a @xmath8 order transition can be expected .",
    "however , one generally does not know a priori whether the new critical point is disorder - dominated .",
    "a number of studies have reported cases in which the addition of quenched disorder to a pure 2-d model at its critical point resulted in another pure ( that is , non - random ) critical model  @xcite .",
    "other studies found quenched disorder to result in new disorder - dominated fixed points  @xcite .",
    "one can often see that a critical point is disorder - dominated by showing that various universal quantities are not self - averaging ( that measurements for a specific ` typical ' sample may differ substantially from those on an average one ) .",
    "one particularly interesting manifestation of this is multifractal behavior , which occurs when an infinite hierarchy of independent scaling dimensions are associated with a single operator  @xcite .",
    "( see for example  @xcite for a relevant discussion . )",
    "all the above studies have focused on the effects of adding quenched disorder to the bulk of a system .",
    "however , it is also interesting to consider the case where the 2-d model has a defect along which impurities have clustered . in this paper",
    "we consider the effects of adding quenched disorder only along a defect line , in each of the minimal models ; these models are labelled by an index @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "each @xmath9 represents a different model : the ising model ( @xmath11 ) , tricritical ising model ( @xmath12 ) , tetracritical ising model ( @xmath13 ) , tricritical three - state potts model ( @xmath14 ) , etc . . .",
    "in section  [ sec - model ] we introduce our defect model , adding quenched disorder in the coupling to @xmath0 ( an operator in the kac table  @xcite ) using replicas .",
    "the physical meaning of this disorder varies from model to model , representing a random magnetic field for the ising model , but fluctuations in the ferromagnetic coupling ( or chemical potential ) in the tricritical ising model and tricritical three - state potts model .",
    "we find that the ising model renormalizes to a non - random model ( consisting of decoupled half - planes with free boundary conditions and no random magnetic field ) , while all other models renormalize to disorder - dominated fixed points . just as with bulk disorder ,",
    "disorder on the defect can result in either a pure or disorder - dominated fixed point .    in section  [ sec - rg.d ]",
    "we calculate the renormalization group equation of the strength of the disorder @xmath15 , to 2-loop order by minimal subtraction  @xcite .",
    "we find that arbitrarily weak disorder grows , and flows to a new fixed point at which @xmath15 is of order @xmath16 .",
    "this justifies a @xmath16 expansion , where critical quantities are calculated perturbatively in @xmath16 .",
    "the `` boundary entropy ''  @xcite at the random fixed point is found to be @xmath17 , and larger than the entropy of the pure fixed point .    in section  [ sec - scaling ] the same scheme",
    "is used to find the moments of correlation functions of the operator @xmath0 along the defect .",
    "( technical details associated with the irreducible representations of the symmetric group  @xcite are delegated to appendices  [ app - rgnm ] and  [ app - combo ] . )",
    "it is found that the moments fall off as a sum of power laws , the dominant term decaying as    @xmath18    with    @xmath19    @xmath20 , so the operator @xmath0 exhibits multifractal behavior .",
    "this leads to a typical decay exponent  @xcite :    @xmath21    in section  [ sec - opfmoments ] we calculate one - point functions of the same operator off the defect line .",
    "the universal ( normalized ) amplitudes of the moments are found to be non - self - averaging , wheras the power law is self - averaging .    in section",
    "[ sec - ising ] , the ising model , which requires special considerations due to the presence of an additional marginal ( boundary ) operator , is analyzed .",
    "it is argued that when a random magnetic field is added along the defect line , the system renormalizes to two decoupled half - plane ising models with free boundary conditions and no disorder .",
    "we finally note that the manipulations needed to get the exponents in eq.([eq : mainres ] ) are similar to those needed to get the decay exponents of moments of two - point functions of @xmath22 , the energy operator , for the @xmath23-state potts model with _ bulk _",
    "disorder in the bond strength .",

    "so when @xmath47 the perturbation in eq.([eq : fulls ] ) is the only relevant one . the following analysis in sections  [ sec - rg.d]-  [ sec - opfmoments ] will assume this , and will thus only hold for @xmath47",
    "this will not be too restrictive , since all quantitites will be calculated by expansion in @xmath48 , and will thus be based on large @xmath9 .",

    "the possible boundary conditions of the ising model have been completely classified  @xcite and the only boundary condition where the spin operator has dimension 1/2 is the free boundary condition .",
    "this makes sense physically , because @xmath164 corresponds to an infinitely antiferromagnetic coupling that produces alternating spins along the defect , which upon coarse - graining gives net magnetization zero everywhere along the line .",
    "we conclude that in the chain case we also flow to two decoupled ising models with free boundary conditions .    if is not hard to see that adding higher cumulant terms of the magnetic field to eq.([eq : imaction ] ) will not change the qualitative results of our 1-loop renormalization group calculations .",

    "two - point functions along the defect exhibit multifractal behavior , and universal ( normalized ) amplitudes of one - point functions are non - self - averaging .",
    "we have also argued that when a random magnetic field is applied along a single line of the ising model , it causes the two sides of the defect to decouple , and to turn into two half - plane ising models with free boundary conditions and no disorder .",

    ". it would be interesting to understand this model in a more fundamental and non - perturbative fashion .",
    "the random boundary / defect fixed points that we have found in this paper are , besides the bulk random bond @xmath23-state potts models , a rare case where detailed analytic information about random critical behavior is available",
    ". in particular , it would be most interesting to compare our results for the random defect lines in minimal models with future numerical results , such as those obtained by jacobsen and cardy for the bulk random potts models@xcite .",

    "analysis performed under the assumption of broken replica symmetry .",
    "such a calculation was done in  @xcite for the q - state potts model with bulk disorder in the bond strength , where it was found that the replica symmetric disordered fixed point is unstable to a new fixed point with broken replica symmetry .",
    "however , numerical tests show that the potts model with random bonds is best described by the replica symmetric fixed point  @xcite .",
    "an identical analysis to that of  @xcite for the random defect problem that is the subject of the present paper shows that , again , the fixed point considered in this paper is unstable , and flows to a new stable fixed point with broken replica symmetry .",
