    "precise calculations of dynamic dipole polarizabilities for atoms are of interest due to its importance in a number of applications .",
    "first , dynamic dipole polarizabilities can be used directly to analyse the ac stark shift to pursue higher - precision atomic clocks  @xcite .",
    "second , investigation of the dynamic dipole polarizabilities can derive the magic wavelengths and tune - out wavelengths , which open a new route to determine the line strength ratio  @xcite and to test the relativistic and quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) effects upon the transition matrix element not on the energy  @xcite . and",
    "at last , since both of the trapping potential depth and the photon - scattering rate are dependent on the polarizabilities , the calculations of the dynamic dipole polarizabilities can provide reliable reference for experimental design to trap atoms in efficiency  @xcite .",
    "as the simplest two - electron system , the accurate theoretical calculations and experimental measurements of the energy levels for helium can be used to test the the three - body bound qed theory  @xcite , to determine the fine structure constant with high - precision  @xcite , to extract the nuclear information without resorting to any model  @xcite , and to develop the multi - electron atomic structure theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , the resonance transition @xmath6 and the doubly - forbidden transition @xmath9 of helium isotopes have attracted great interest for the determination of nuclear charge radius difference  @xcite . combined the laser cooling with magneto - optical trap techniques , the transitions @xmath6 and @xmath7 of helium",
    "are also demonstrated to produce high density quantum gas  @xcite .",
    "the key point to improve the experimental measurement precision for helium is setting the laser frequency at the magic wavelength to eliminate effectively the ac stark shift induced by the trap light .    at present , there are lots of literatures focused on the accurate calculations of the energy and polarizabilities  @xcite for the ground state of helium . for example , the non - relativistic ground - state energy has been achieved up to 46 digits  @xcite , and the static dipole polarizability of the ground - state helium , which includes the effect of mass polarization , the relativistic and leading qed corrections , has been determined to 1.383 191(2 ) within 2 ppm accuracy  @xcite .",
