    "the first successful application of quantum mechanics to nuclear physics problem is the theory of @xmath0-decay which was presented independently by gamow and by condon and gurney in 1928 @xcite .",
    "based on the gamow theory , the experimental @xmath0-decay half - lives of nuclei can be well explained by both phenomenological and microscopic models @xcite .",
    "such @xmath0-decay calculations are mainly concentrated on the favored cases , _",
    "e.g. _ the ground - state to ground - state @xmath0-transitions of even - even nuclei ( @xmath4@xmath5=0 ) @xcite . besides the favored @xmath0-transitions",
    ", the ground - state of the parent nucleus can also decay to the excited states of the daughter nucleus ( @xmath4@xmath5@xmath60 ) @xcite .",
    "recently , there is increasing interest in two kinds of @xmath0-transitions of even - even nuclei from both experimental and theoretical sides , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath0-decay to excited 0@xmath7 states and to members of the ground - state rotational band @xcite .",
    "these @xmath0-transitions belong to the unfavored case , which are strongly hindered as compared with the ground - state ones .",
    "theoretically , the hindered @xmath0-transition is an effective tool to study the properties of @xmath0-emitters because it is closely related to the internal structure of nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , it is very difficult to describe quantitatively the unfavored @xmath0-transitions due to the influence of both non - zero angular momentum and excitation of nucleons , especially for @xmath0-emitters in the neighborhood of the shell closures .",
    "although the favored @xmath0-decay model can be straightforwardly applied to the unfavored @xmath0-transition , the calculated branching ratios usually deviate significantly from the experimental data . considering the complexity of hindered @xmath0-decay ,",
    "it is very interesting to find a simple way of explaining the available data of hindered @xmath0-decay based on the favored @xmath0-decay theory .",
    "experimentally it is also very helpful to make theoretical predictions on unobserved hindered @xmath0-transitions for future studies .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the hindered @xmath0-transitions of even - even nuclei with mass numbers 180@xmath2a@xmath2202 and a@xmath3224 .",
    "we apply a simple barrier penetration approach to calculate the branching ratios of @xmath0-decay based on the gamow theory .",
    "the influence of the @xmath0-decay energy , the angular momentum of the @xmath0-particle , and the excitation probability of the daughter nucleus are properly taken into account .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section ii is the framework of the barrier penetration approach .",
    "the numerical results and corresponding discussions are given in section iii .",
    "section iv is a brief summary .",
    "firstly , we start with the radial schrdinger equation @xmath8\\psi ( r ) = e\\psi(r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the centrifugal potential @xmath9 is included in the schrdinger equation and @xmath10 is the standard square well potential @xmath11    -decay and the quantum - tunnelling effect of the @xmath0-particle.,width=302 ]    the schematic representation of the square well potential is given in fig.1 .",
    "the @xmath0-particle in the parent nucleus is initially trapped within this square well potential and the corresponding wave function is denoted by @xmath12 in fig.1 , _ i.e. _ the incoming wave function . through quantum - tunnelling effect the @xmath0-particle is finally emitted from the parent nucleus and then characterized by the wave function of a free particle @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ the outgoing wave function .",
    "the penetration probability of the @xmath0-particle through the coulomb barrier is proportional to the square of the ratio between the outgoing and incoming wave functions .",
    "using the well known wkb technique , one can obtain the penetration probability of the @xmath0-particle @xcite @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath15^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the charge numbers of the @xmath0-particle and the daughter nucleus , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the reduced mass of the @xmath0-core system and @xmath5 is the angular momentum carried by the @xmath0-particle .",
    "@xmath19 is the decay energy of the ground - state transition and @xmath20 is the excitation energy of state @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath21 is the radius of the daughter nucleus ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 is the outer classic turning point ( see fig.1 ) .    in describing @xmath0-decay of heavy nuclei ,",
    "the height of the centrifugal barrier at @xmath24 is generally very small compared with the coulomb barrier @xcite @xmath25    by expanding the wave number @xmath26 in powers of the small quantity @xmath27 , the penetration probability can be written in a simple form @xcite @xmath28 \\times \\textrm{exp } [ -\\sqrt{\\frac { \\hbar^2 } { 2\\mu } } \\frac{2 \\ell(\\ell + 1)}{(z_1 z_2 e^{2 } r_0)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\,],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term represents the influence of the excitation energy @xmath20 on the penetration factor and the second term denotes the influence of the non - zero angular momentum @xmath5 .",
    "historically , the separable form of the penetration factor ( eq.(6 ) ) was first derived by gamow @xcite and then discussed by rasmussen _",
    ". similar expression of the penetration factor is also given in the textbook of bohr and mottelson @xcite . from eq.(6 ) , it is easy to find that the penetration probability of the @xmath0-particle reaches maximum value when both the excitation energy @xmath20 and the angular momentum @xmath5 are zero , _ i.e. _ the @xmath0-transition to the ground - state of the daughter nucleus .",
    "this is in accord with the experimental fact that the ground - state branching ratio of @xmath0-decay is the largest for all even - even @xmath0-emitters @xcite .",
    "the residual daughter nucleus after disintegration has the most probability to stay in its ground state , and the probability to stay in its excited state is relatively much smaller .",
    "therefore it is a reasonable assumption that the probability of the residual daughter nucleus to stay in its excited states ( @xmath29=2@xmath7 , 4@xmath7 , 6@xmath7 , ... ) obeys the boltzmann distribution @xmath30,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the excitation energy of state @xmath5 and @xmath32 is a free parameter .",
    "we include the excitation probability function ( eq.(7 ) ) in our approach .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath32 is fixed to 1.5 in present calculation .",
    "this means that only a single parameter is introduced in the whole calculation .",
    "it is stressed that the inclusion of the excitation probability is reasonable in physics and it can lead to good agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "here we define @xmath33 as the product of the penetration factor and the excitation probability @xmath34 which denotes the total probability of @xmath0-transition from the ground - state of the parent nucleus to the excited state @xmath35 of the daughter nucleus .",
    "it is written in a very accessible style of three exponential factors which contain the essential theory of @xmath0-decay .",
    "it is very convenient to estimate the influence of these factors on the hindered @xmath0-transitions from @xmath36 . with the help of @xmath36 , the branching ratios of @xmath0-decay to each state of the rotational band of the daughter nucleus",
    "can be written as @xmath37    similarly , the branching ratio of @xmath0-decay to the excited @xmath1 state of the daughter nucleus is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39% is the branching ratio of @xmath0-transition between the ground states .",
    "it can be further simplified because the angular momentum carried by the @xmath0-particle is zero @xmath40 \\times \\textrm{exp}\\ { \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{\\hbar^2}}\\ , z_1 z_2 e^{2}\\ , \\pi[\\frac{1}{q_{\\alpha}^{\\frac{1}{2}}}-\\frac{1}{(q_{\\alpha}-e^*_{\\ell})^{\\frac{1}{2}}}]\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath0-transition to the excited @xmath41 state of the daughter nucleus does not involve the change of angular momentum @xmath5 , which is an ideal case for theoretical studies of hindered @xmath0-transitions .    here",
    "we would like to mention that the derivation of the above formulas starts with a square well potential , which is a rough approximation of the real potential between the @xmath0-particle and the daughter nucleus . in principle",
    ", the nuclear and coulomb potentials determining the @xmath0-decay process should be very smooth and not peaked .",
    "actually more realistic potentials have been widely used to describe the decay properties of a large number of nuclei .",
    "for instance , royer has made a systematic calculation on the @xmath0-decay half - lives by the generalized liquid drop model ( gldm ) @xcite .",
    "the important proximity energy is properly included due to the attractive forces in the neck and the gap between the two close fragments @xcite .",
    "the obtained @xmath0-decay barrier is more realistic as compared with the pure coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "we also systematically calculated the favored @xmath0-decay half - lives with a double - folding potential in the framework of the density - dependent cluster model ( ddcm ) @xcite . the nuclear potential from the double - folding formulism is also microscopic because it correctly includes the low - density behavior of the nucleon - nucleon interaction and guarantees the antisymmetrization of identical particles in the @xmath0-cluster and in the core @xcite . in present study , we are interested in calculating the @xmath0-decay branching ratio to the rotational members and to the excited 0@xmath42 states . to simplify the above problem",
    ", we assume that the nuclear potential vanishes outside the radius of the daughter nucleus @xmath43 ( see fig.1 ) by using a square well potential . however , it is expected that the final expression is not very sensitive to the form of the nuclear potential .",
    "this is due to the magnitude of the branching ratio is determined by the proportion of the total penetration factors between the excited and ground states ( @xmath44= @xmath45@xmath46 ) . in this situation ,",
    "the influence of the non - vanishing nuclear potential on the branching ratio can be approximately cancelled in calculations .",
    "this is also different from the studies of @xmath0-decay half - lives where the details of the nuclear potential become very important ( decay width @xmath47 ) .",
    "it is considered that the present approximation with a square well potential will not affect the final results of the branching ratios significantly .",
    "the @xmath0-transitions to members of the ground - state rotational band are systematically calculated for well deformed nuclei with z@xmath390 .",
    "the systematic calculation on @xmath0-decay branching ratios to the rotational band is rare because some data of the excited states have been obtained very recently @xcite .",
    "experimentally it is known that the ground - state of the even - even actinides mainly decays to the 0@xmath42 and 2@xmath42 states of their daughter nucleus @xcite .",
    "the sum of branching ratios to the 0@xmath42 and 2@xmath42 states is as large as 99% in many cases .",
    "the @xmath0-transitions to other members of the rotational band ( i@xmath42=4@xmath42 , 6@xmath42 , 8@xmath42 ... ) are strongly hindered .",
    "this is different from the @xmath0-transition to the ground or excited @xmath41 state where the angular momentum carried by the @xmath0-particle is zero ( @xmath48=0 ) . here",
    "the influence of the non - zero angular momentum should be included for @xmath48@xmath60 transitions . in fig.2@xmath49fig.4 , we give three typical figures for @xmath0-decay fine structure of @xmath50pu , @xmath51 cm and @xmath52cf .",
    "the @xmath0-decay branching ratios of @xmath50pu and @xmath51 cm have been measured up to 8@xmath42 state of the rotational band , and the branching ratio of @xmath52cf has been measured up to 6@xmath42 state in experiment .",
    "it is shown in these figures that the calculated values agree with the experimental ones for both the low - lying states ( 0@xmath42 , 2@xmath42 ) and the high - lying ones ( 6@xmath42 , 8@xmath42 ) , however , the calculated branching ratio to 4@xmath42 state is slightly larger than the experimental one .",
    "let us take the @xmath0-decay of @xmath50pu as an example to illustrate the discrepancy of branching ratio to @xmath53 state . from fig.2",
    ", we can see that the proportion between the experimental branching ratios of 2@xmath42 and 4@xmath42 states is @xmath54=28.98%/0.105%@xmath55276 , but the proportion between the branching ratios of 4@xmath42 and 6@xmath42 states is only 0.105%/0.0030%@xmath5535 and the proportion between 6@xmath42 and 8@xmath42 states is also small 0.0030%/(6.8@xmath5610@xmath57%)@xmath5544 .",
    "thus the proportion of @xmath58 is very large as compared with those of other rotational members .",
    "this shows that the variation of the experimental branching ratios is not very smooth . on the contrary ,",
    "our calculated branching ratios vary smoothly for different excited states and this leads to the slight disagreement between theory and data for @xmath53 state . besides the calculation of decay chain @xmath52cf@xmath59@xmath51cm@xmath59@xmath50pu , we have also calculated the branching ratios of ground - state rotational band for even - mass @xmath0-emitters @xmath60th , @xmath61u , @xmath62pu , @xmath63 cm , @xmath64cf and @xmath65fm .",
    "the discrepancy in describing 4@xmath42 state also exists for these even - even @xmath0-emitters in our calculation .",
    "we call this as the abnormity of 4@xmath42 state in @xmath0-decay for convenience .",
    "it is very interesting to pursue this by performing more microscopic calculation in future . nevertheless , the overall agreement of branching ratios to the rotational band of these nuclei is acceptable in present study .",
