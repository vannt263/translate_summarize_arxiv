    "when @xmath14 , we deal with the class of lipschitz continuous analytic functions .",
    "although the same characterization holds , a more involved argument , due to uy @xcite , is needed to show that sets of positive area are not removable .",
    "+ the same question may be asked in the more general setting of @xmath5-quasiregular mappings . given a domain @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    ", one says that a mapping @xmath17 is @xmath5-quasiregular in @xmath18 if @xmath19 is a @xmath20 solution of the beltrami equation , @xmath21 for almost every @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , the beltrami coefficient , is a measurable function such that @xmath24 at almost every @xmath22 . if @xmath19 is a homeomorphism , then @xmath19 is said to be @xmath5-quasiconformal .",

    "+   + it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath1 is a compact set satisfying @xmath26 , @xmath27 , then @xmath1 is removable for @xmath3-hlder continuous @xmath5-quasiregular mappings .",
    "this means that any function @xmath10 , @xmath5-quasiregular in @xmath6 , is actually @xmath5-quasiregular on the whole plane . to look for results in the converse direction",
    ", one observes that any compact set @xmath1 with @xmath28 is nonremovable for holomorphic functions and , thus , neither for @xmath5-quasiregular mappings in @xmath29 .",
    "hence , we are interested in dimensions between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in this paper",
    "we show that the index @xmath30 is sharp in the following sense : given @xmath8 and @xmath16 , for any @xmath32 there exists a compact set @xmath1 of dimension  @xmath2 , and a function @xmath10 which is @xmath5-quasiregular in @xmath6 , and with no @xmath5-quasiregular extension to @xmath4 . in other words , we will construct nonremovable sets at any dimension strictly above  @xmath30 .",
    "+   + we first have a look at the case @xmath33 .",
    "given a compact set @xmath1 with @xmath28 , by frostman s lemma ( see for instance @xcite ) , there exists a positive radon measure @xmath34 supported on  @xmath1 , such that @xmath35 for any @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the function @xmath37 is @xmath3-hlder continuous everywhere , holomorphic outside the support of @xmath34 and has no entire extension . +",
    "another close situation is found in the limiting case @xmath38 , in which @xmath39 should be replaced by  @xmath40 .",
    "again , when @xmath33 , kaufman @xcite characterized the @xmath41 removable compact sets as those with zero length . when @xmath42 , it is known ( @xcite,@xcite ) that sets with @xmath43 are removable for  @xmath41 @xmath5-quasiregular mappings . in fact ,",
    "the appearence of this index @xmath44 is not strange . in  @xcite",
    ", astala showed that for any @xmath5-quasiconformal mapping @xmath45 and any compact set @xmath1 , @xmath46 furthermore , both equalities are always attainable . in particular , sets of dimension @xmath44",
    "are @xmath5-quasiconformally mapped to sets of dimension at most @xmath47 , which is the critical point for the analytic @xmath41 situation .",
    "hence , from equality at ( [ dimdist ] ) , there exists for any @xmath48 a compact set @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 and a @xmath5-quasiconformal mapping @xmath45 that maps @xmath1 to a compact set @xmath49 with dimension @xmath50 in particular , @xmath51 . as above , one has a positive radon measure @xmath34 supported on @xmath49 , with linear growth , whose cauchy transform @xmath37 is holomorphic on @xmath6 and has a @xmath40 extension which is not entire .",
    "now , since @xmath40 is invariant under quasiconformal changes of variables @xcite , the composition @xmath52 is a @xmath40 @xmath5-quasiregular mapping on @xmath6 which has no @xmath5-quasiregular extension to @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "the set @xmath1 is not removable for @xmath41 @xmath5-quasiregular mappings .",
    "this argument shows that the index @xmath44 is somewhat critical for the @xmath41 @xmath5-quasiregular problem . +   + our plan is to repeat the above argument , but replacing @xmath40 by @xmath39 .",
    "that is , given any dimension @xmath0 , we will construct a compact set @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 and a @xmath39 function which is @xmath5-quasiregular on @xmath6 but not on @xmath4 .",
    "we will start with a compact set @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 and a @xmath5-quasiconformal mapping @xmath45 such that @xmath53 .",
    "then , we will show that there are @xmath54 functions , for some @xmath55 , analytic outside of @xmath49 , which in turn induce ( by composition ) @xmath5-quasiregular functions on @xmath6 with some global hlder continuity exponent .",
    "this construction will find two obstacles .",
    "first , the extremal dimension distortion of sets of dimension  @xmath56 through @xmath5-quasiconformal mappings is not exactly @xmath31 , the critical number in the analytic setting ( this was so for @xmath38 ) .",
    "second , the composition of @xmath57-hlder continuous functions with @xmath5-quasiconformal mappings is only in @xmath58 , so there is some loose of regularity that might be decisive . to avoid these troubles , we will construct in an explicit way the mapping @xmath45 .",
    "this concrete construction allows us to show that @xmath45 exhibits an exponent of hlder continuity given by @xmath59 which is larger than the usual @xmath60 obtained from mori s theorem .",
    "this regularity will be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath61 and @xmath62 it is natural to expect @xmath45 to be @xmath63 .",
    "in all this section , @xmath64 will denote the open disk of center @xmath65 and radius @xmath66 .",
    "by @xmath67 we mean the diameter of the disk @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the disk concentric with @xmath68 but such that @xmath70 .",
    "by @xmath71 we will mean the unit disk , while @xmath72 will denote the jacobian determinant of the function @xmath19 .",
    "+ recall that a cantor - type set @xmath73 of @xmath74 components is the only compact set which is invariant through a fixed finite family of @xmath74 similitudes @xmath75 with @xmath76 for all @xmath77 , such that @xmath78 are disjoint .",
    "in other words , @xmath79 is the only solution to the equation @xmath80 constructively , @xmath81 where @xmath82 for any chain @xmath83 of length @xmath84 of members of  @xmath85 .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of @xmath73 is the only solution @xmath30 to the equation @xmath86 and under the additional assumption @xmath87 for all @xmath88 , one easily gets @xmath89 under some additional assumptions on @xmath90 ( such as having image sets @xmath91 uniformly distributed in @xmath71 ) , we say that @xmath73 is a regular cantor set . for them , @xmath92 .",
    "+   + one of the main results in @xcite is the sharpness of the dimension distortion equation ( [ dimdist ] ) . to obtain the equality there ,",
    "the author moved holomorphically a fixed cantor - type set @xmath93 .",
    "this movement defined actually a _ holomorphic motion _ on @xmath93 .",
    "an interesting extension result , known as the @xmath94-lemma , allowed to extend this motion quasiconformally from @xmath93 to the whole plane .",
    "this procedure avoided most of the technicalities and gave the desired result in a surprisingly direct way .",
    "however , since we look both for extremal dimension distortion and higher hlder continuity , we need to construct @xmath45 explicitly .",
    "thus , let @xmath95 and @xmath16 be fixed numbers , and denote @xmath96 . as in @xcite , we first give a @xmath5-quasiconformal mapping @xmath45 that maps a regular cantor set @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 , to another regular cantor set @xmath49 for which @xmath97 is as close as we want to @xmath98 .",
    "later , again as in @xcite , we will glue a sequence of such mappings in the convenient way .      1 .",
    "@xmath45 is the identity mapping on @xmath101 .",
    "2 .   @xmath1 is a self - similar cantor set , constructed with @xmath102 similarities .",
    "3 .   @xmath103 .",
    "4 .   @xmath104 if and only if @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106 whenever @xmath107 .",
    "our construction follows the scheme in @xcite .",
    "thus , we will obtain @xmath45 as a limit of a sequence of @xmath5-quasiconformal mappings @xmath108 where every @xmath109 will act at the @xmath110-th step of the construction of @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , both @xmath1 and @xmath49 will be regular cantor sets associated to two fixed families of similitudes @xmath111 and @xmath112 . at the @xmath110-th step",
    ", @xmath109 will map each _ generating disk _ of @xmath1 , @xmath113 , to the corresponding generating disk of the image set , @xmath114 .",
    "since @xmath45 is said both to be @xmath5-quasiconformal and to give extremal distortion of dimension , we think about using a typical radial stretching , @xmath115 conveniently modified .",
    "it turns out that this radial stetching @xmath19 is extremal for some basic properties of @xmath5-quasiconformal mappings , such as hlder continuity . in order to avoid that our mapping @xmath45 also lives in no better hlder space than @xmath116 (",
    "actually for @xmath19 this is the case ) , we will replace  @xmath19 by a linear mapping in a small neighbourhood of its singularity .",
    "this change will not affect the integrability index , and at the same time will give some improvement on the hlder exponent .",
    "+ take @xmath117 , and consider @xmath74 disjoint disks inside of @xmath71 , @xmath118 , uniformly distributed , all with the same radius @xmath119 . by taking @xmath74 big enough , we may always assume that @xmath120 .",
    "given any @xmath121 to be determined later , we can consider @xmath74 similitudes @xmath122 and denote , for every @xmath123 , @xmath124 where here we have written @xmath125 .",
    "we define @xmath126 it may be easily seen that @xmath127 defines a @xmath5-quasiconformal mapping , which is conformal everywhere except on each ring @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , if we put @xmath129 then @xmath127 maps every @xmath130 to itself , while each @xmath131 is mapped to  @xmath132 , as is shown in figure 1 .",
    "now we denote @xmath133 .",
    "+   + at the second step , we will repeat the above procedure inside of every @xmath134 , and the rest will remain fixed .",
    "that is , we will define @xmath135 on the target set of @xmath136 , and then construct @xmath137 as @xmath138 to do it more explicitly , we deonte @xmath139 where a computation shows that @xmath140 .",
    "now we define @xmath141 by construction , @xmath135 is @xmath5-quasiconformal on @xmath4 , conformal outside a union of @xmath142 rings , and maps  @xmath143 to  @xmath144 , while every point outside of the disks @xmath145 remains fixed through @xmath135 , as figure 2 shows .",
    "thus , the composition @xmath146 ( see figure 3 ) is still @xmath5-quasiconformal , agrees with the identity outside of @xmath71 , and @xmath147 for any @xmath148 .",
    "+   + after @xmath149 steps , we will define @xmath150 on the target side of @xmath151 . for each multiindex @xmath152 of length @xmath84",
    "we will denote @xmath153 where now @xmath154 .",
    "then , the mapping @xmath155 is @xmath5-quasiconformal on the plane , with @xmath42 only on a union of @xmath156 rings .",
    "moreover , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , where @xmath159 .      as a consequence ,",
    "the composition @xmath160 is also @xmath5-quasiconformal and @xmath161 with this procedure , it is clear that the sequence @xmath109 is uniformly convergent to a homeomorphism  @xmath45 .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath45 has distortion bounded by @xmath5 almost everywhere and , in fact , that @xmath45 is a @xmath5-quasiconformal mapping . by construction",
    ", @xmath45 maps the regular cantor set @xmath162 which obviously is also a regular cantor set .",
    "if now we choose @xmath163 so that @xmath164 we directly obtain , by one hand , @xmath165 , and by the other , @xmath166 since @xmath167 for all @xmath74 , we may always get @xmath168 just increasing @xmath74 if needed . +   +",
    "now we have to look at the regularity properties of our mapping @xmath45 .",
    "to do that , we introduce the following notation : put @xmath169 , and denote by @xmath170 and by @xmath171 , respectively , the protecting and generating disks of generation @xmath110 , that is , for any chain @xmath152 , @xmath172 with this notation , @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "+   + now take any @xmath176 such that @xmath104 . of course",
    ", we can assume @xmath177 .",
    "then , one may decompose the @xmath176-mass of @xmath178 over @xmath71 in the following way @xmath179 and since @xmath180 on @xmath181 , @xmath182 where here @xmath183 and @xmath184 denote , respectively , any of the protecting and generating disks of first generation .",
    "now , one may repeat this argument for the last integral , and by a recursive argument we get @xmath185 where , as before , @xmath186 and @xmath187 denote any protecting or , respectively , generating disk of @xmath110-th  generation .",
    "now we compute separatedly the integrals in both sums . by one hand , if @xmath152 @xmath188 under the additional assumption @xmath189 , and where @xmath190 . if @xmath191 , we get @xmath192 on the other hand , for any value of @xmath176 , @xmath193 thus , for any @xmath189 we get @xmath194 since @xmath176 is such that @xmath104 , we necessarily get @xmath195 . for @xmath74",
    "big enough this is equivalent to @xmath196 , i.e. @xmath197 . at the critical point , @xmath191",
    ", one gets @xmath198 which will always converge , for any fixed value of @xmath74 .",
    "this shows that we can choose @xmath74 big enough so that @xmath199 if and only if @xmath105 . +   + finally , it just remains to check that @xmath45 is hlder continuous with exponent @xmath200 . by means of poincar inequality",
    "together with the quasiconformality of @xmath45 , it is enough @xcite to show that for any disk @xmath68 @xmath201 hence , for some fixed disk @xmath68 , take @xmath110 such that @xmath202 .",
    "we have @xmath203 where the union @xmath204 runs over all disks @xmath171 such that @xmath205 . on @xmath206 , we easily see that @xmath207 thus , @xmath208 on the other hand , recall that @xmath209 are disks of radius @xmath210 .",
    "hence , @xmath211 and it just remains to bound @xmath212 . actually , this is equivalent to find some constant  @xmath73 such that @xmath213 but the disks @xmath171 come from a self - similar construction , said to give a regular cantor set of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , they may be chosen uniformly distributed so that the so - called @xmath2-_dimensional packing condition _ is satisfied , that is , @xmath214 it is easy to show that this condition implies the @xmath215-dimensional one for all @xmath216 ( in particular , for  @xmath217 ) .",
    "hence , the constant @xmath73 exists and is independent of @xmath74 .",
    "thus , what we finally get is that @xmath218 and the result follows .",
    "given @xmath99 , @xmath16 and @xmath219 , let @xmath100 and @xmath1 be as in proposition [ prop1 ] .",
    "then , for any fixed @xmath222 , the mapping @xmath223 and the set @xmath224 exhibit the same properties than @xmath45 and @xmath1 , since neither @xmath5-quasiconformality nor hausdorff dimension are modified through dilations . however , when computing the new @xmath63 constant , if @xmath225 then @xmath226 thus , as in @xcite , let @xmath227 be a countable disjoint family of disks inside of @xmath71 , and let @xmath228 be a sequence of positive numbers , @xmath229 as @xmath230 . for each @xmath231 , let @xmath232 and @xmath233 be as in proposition  [ prop1 ] , so that @xmath234 .",
    "in particular , each @xmath233 is a regular cantor set of @xmath235 components .",
    "denote then @xmath236 and @xmath237 , and define @xmath238 by construction , @xmath239 is a @xmath5-quasiconformal mapping .",
    "it maps the set @xmath240 to the set @xmath241 .",
    "moreover , @xmath242 is @xmath163-finite , while @xmath243 finally , assume that @xmath65 lives inside some fixed @xmath244 and that @xmath245 .",
    "then , consider the line segment @xmath246 between @xmath65 and @xmath247 , and denote @xmath248 .",
    "then , both @xmath249 and @xmath247 are fixed points for @xmath239 , so that @xmath250 since we are still free of choosing the disks @xmath251 , we may do it so that the radius @xmath252 satisfy @xmath253 or , equivalently , @xmath254 . under this assumption , we finally get @xmath255 whenever @xmath107 .",
    "this clearly shows that @xmath256 .",
    "although the set in corollary [ coro1 ] is more critical than the one we constructed in proposition [ prop1 ] , in the sense that the first gives precisely the extremal dimension distortion , both do the same work when studying non - removable sets for hlder - continuous quasiregular mappings .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath45 be such that @xmath257 for some @xmath258 small enough .",
    "hence , by frostmann s lemma , we can construct a positive radon measure @xmath23 supported on @xmath49 , with growth  @xmath259 .",
    "its cauchy transform @xmath260 defines a holomorphic function on @xmath261 , not entire , and with a hlder continuous extension to the whole plane , with exponent @xmath262 .",
    "set @xmath263 clearly , @xmath19 is @xmath5-quasiregular on @xmath6 and has no @xmath5-quasiregular extension to @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19 is hlder continuous with exponent @xmath264 thus , we just need @xmath99 small enough so that @xmath265 but this inequality is equivalent to @xmath266 and the proof is complete .",
    "something similar may be said when dealing with finite distortion mappings .",
    "recall that if @xmath15 is an open set , then a _ finite distortion mapping _ on @xmath18 is a function @xmath17 in the sobolev class @xmath267 with locally integrable jacobian , @xmath268 , and such that there is a measurable function @xmath269 $ ] , finite almost everywhere , called the _ distortion function _ of @xmath19 , for which @xmath270 at almost every @xmath22 . when @xmath271 , @xmath272 , one recovers the class of @xmath5-quasiregular mappings",
    "however , weaker assumptions on @xmath273 also give interesting results .",
    "the most typical situation appears for _ exponentially integrable distortion mappings _ , that is , finite distortion mappings  @xmath19 for which the distortion function @xmath273 satisfies @xmath274 for some @xmath176 big enough . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that compact sets @xmath1 with @xmath163-finite @xmath275 are removable for exponentially integrable distortion mappings in @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath276 .",

    "thus , we have a compact set @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 , and a @xmath39 function @xmath19 , @xmath5-quasiregular on @xmath6 but not on @xmath4 .",
    "of course , @xmath19 is an exponentially integrable distortion mapping on @xmath6 , with distortion function @xmath273 essentially bounded by @xmath5 . if @xmath19 extended to a finite distortion mapping on @xmath4 , in particular we would have @xmath268 .",
    "but then , since @xmath278 at almost every point , this would imply that actually @xmath19  extends @xmath5-quasiregularly .",
    "at this point , it should be said that above the critical index @xmath56 one might find also some removable set .",
    "for instance , due to an unpublished result of s. smirnov , it is known that if @xmath279 and @xmath45 is a @xmath5-quasiconformal mapping , then @xmath280 which is better than the usual dimension distortion equation ( [ dimdist ] ) .",
