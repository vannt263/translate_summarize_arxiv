    "qed processes at high energy in the field of a heavy nucleus or atom are the classical examples of the processes in a strong field .",
    "they show up in many experimental setups , including those designed for completely different purposes , not connected with observation of these processes .",
    "therefore , their investigation clearly has a practical value . from the theoretical point of view , these processes are interesting because they provide an important insight into the structure of the higher - order effects of the perturbation theory .",
    "general approach to the strong - field calculations is the use of the furry representation . in this approach",
    "the wave functions and propagators of particles are replaced by the exact solutions and green functions of the wave equations in the external field . however , even for the pure coulomb field these objects are very complicated and their use for the practical calculations is limited .",
    "fortunately , at high energies of initial particles the final particle momenta usually have small angles with respect to the incident direction .",
    "this is where the quasiclassical approximation comes into play . in this approximation ,",
    "the wave functions and propagators acquire remarkably simple forms which allow for the effective use in specific calculations .",
    "the quasiclassical green s function of the dirac equation in the external field have been derived for a number of field configurations , see ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a pure coulomb field , ref .",
    "@xcite for an arbitrary spherically symmetric field , ref .",
    "@xcite for a localized field which generally possesses no spherical symmetry , and ref .",
    "@xcite for combined strong laser and atomic fields .",
    "even more surprising is the fact that within this approximation it appears to be possible to derive the results not only in the leading order , but also a first quasiclassical correction to them .",
    "basic processes in the field of heavy atom are the electron - positron pair photoproduction ( pp ) and electron bremsstrahlung ( bs ) .",
    "they both have a long history of investigation , for the former process see reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the total cross section of electron - positron pair photoproduction",
    "there is also a formal expression @xcite , exact in the parameter @xmath3 and the photon energy @xmath4 ( here @xmath5 is the atomic charge number , @xmath6 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath7 ) .",
    "it has the form of multiple slowly converging sums containing the hypergeometric function of two arguments @xmath8 . due to these complications ,",
    "the computation based on this expression rapidly becomes intractable with the growth of @xmath4 , and the numerical results have been obtained so far only for @xmath9 mev @xcite . at high energy",
    "the quasiclassical approximation is applicable and the leading quasiclassical term , for both pair production and bremsstrahlung , has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the first quasiclassical corrections to the spectra of both processes as well as to the total cross section of pair production have been obtained in refs .",
    "it is remarkable that the quasiclassical correction to the total cross section of pair production can not be obtain by simply integrating the quasiclassical correction to the spectrum .",
    "this is because of the contribution of the tip regions of the spectrum , where only one particle can be considered quasiclassically .",
    "a detailed investigation of this region was made in ref .",
    "the corresponding angular distribution was derived in ref .",
    "recently , the first quasiclassical correction to the fully differential cross section was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 pair photoproduction and in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath10 pair photoproduction . as a result ,",
    "charge asymmetry in these processes was predicted .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the quasiclassical approach to the investigation of @xmath0 photoproduction in the field of a heavy atom accompanied by bremsstrahlung .",
    "the cross section of this process is a significant part of the radiative corrections to @xmath0 photoproduction as well as noticeable background to such processes as delbrck scattering and others .",
    "this process should be taken into account at the consideration of the electromagnetic showers in the matter . in spite of its importance , there are only few theoretical results related to this process @xcite . in those papers",
    "the born approximation was used , while there are no theoretical results exact in the parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the goal of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , we would like to fill the gap in the theoretical description of the process , and , in particular , determine the magnitude of the coulomb corrections for various kinematic regions .",
    "we show that , apart from the region of very small momentum transfer , the coulomb corrections for heavy atoms drastically change the result compared to the born approximation .",
    "second , we would like to demonstrate how smoothly the quasiclassical approach works for this complicated case .",
    "we consider in detail the case of a pure coulomb field and then present the modification due to screening by atomic electrons .",
    "the main contribution to the cross section of the process @xmath12 is given by the region of small angles between the momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles . in this region @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the momenta of initial photon , final photon , electron and positron , respectively , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
