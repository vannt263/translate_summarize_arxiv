    "high @xmath0 observables are a cornerstone of the experimental ultrarelativistic heavy - ion ( a - a ) program at both rhic and lhc . one crucial goal of this program is the extraction of properties of the produced quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) matter droplet , for instance in terms of characteristic transport coefficients and their temperature dependence .",
    "two such coefficients , @xmath1 ( the mean gain in transverse momentum squared of a high @xmath3 parton per unit pathlength ) and @xmath2 ( the mean longitudinal momentum loss of a high @xmath3 parton per unit pathlegth ) are particularly relevant in this context . here , @xmath1 is responsible for energy loss from hard partons into medium - induced soft gluon radiation whereas @xmath2 causes energy loss into non - perturbative medium degrees of freedom ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the only known way of extracting the temperature dependence of these coefficients from the data is to use perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) to compute the primary hard parton productiona and then to embed a model for the parton - medium final state interaction into a fluid - dynamical simulation of the matter to obtain the medium - modification to the final state of the hard process .",
    "the transport coefficient is in this approach computed as a function of thermodynamical parameters in the fluid dynamics , e.g. energy density @xmath8 , temperature @xmath9 or entropy density @xmath10 as well as potentially the flow vector @xmath11 of the medium relative to the c.m .",
    "frame of the collision .    based on the notion of counting the number density of potential scattering centers in an ideal gas ,",
    "many jet quenching models assume    @xmath12    which for an ideal gas equation of state @xmath13 all coincide .",
    "differences to the ideal gas for all three expressions occur close to the phase transition and in the hadronic phase and have previously been discussed in e.g. @xcite . in the presence of a finite flow value , a relativistic correction term dependent on the local flow rapidty @xmath14 at the position @xmath15 and the angle @xmath16 between parton momentum vector and flow vector has been found both in weak and strong coupling as @xcite    @xmath17    in practice , this factor corresponds to a small correction @xcite .",
    "given such a model setting , a @xmath18 fit of the proportionality constant between transport coefficient and thermodynamical parameter to e.g. the single inclusive hadron nuclear suppression factor @xmath19 is possible @xcite and results in a temperature dependence of @xmath1 compatible with the data .",
    "however , such a procedure does not yield consistent results across different models @xcite , indicating that the uncertainties in the choice of the parton - medium interaction model and the medium evolution itself are substantial .",
    "one solution is to include other observables into the fit , for instance the suppression factor of the back - to - back coincidences @xmath20 @xcite , however for multiple observables and across the full parameter space of available fluid dynamics and parton - medium interaction models , such a strategy becomes prohibitively expensive .    a further source of uncertainty is that any temperature dependence of the extracted transport coefficients is essentially not determined in a data - driven way but assumed _ a priori _ using a relation like eq .",
    "( [ e-1 ] ) .",
    "however , in @xcite a scenario was suggested in which parton - medium interaction is not reduced but parametrically enhanced close to the phase transition temperature @xmath6 ( near @xmath6 enhancement , referred to as ntc in the following ) .",
    "this suggestion was driven by the need to explain the experimentally observed large split between in - plane and out of plane particle emission at high @xmath0 @xcite when the dependence of @xmath19 with respect to the reaction plane angle @xmath21 is considered in non - central a - a collisions . a careful systematic study across many different model frameworks",
    "@xcite has demonstrated however that the magnitude of the split is influenced by many factors , among them the assumed pathlength dependence of energy loss , the initial eccentricity of the medium , viscous entropy production during the medium evolution and the total size of the spacetime volume in which hard partons interact with the medium .",
    "taking all these systematic uncertainties into account , it is not clear whether there is a remaining tension with the data , however there is a trend across several models to underpredict the spread @xcite .    the aim of this work is to quantify the potential effect of a ntc scenario on both the extraction of a transport coefficient @xmath1 and on the spread between in - plane and out of plane @xmath19 .",
    "the observable considered in this study is the single inclusive hadron suppression factor @xmath19 which is defined as the yield of high @xmath0 hadrons from an a - a collision normalized to the yield in p - p collisions at the same energy corrected for the number of binary collisions ,    @xmath22    the default expectation is @xmath23 in medium since parton - medium interaction is expected to lead to a flow of high @xmath3 parton momentum into medium degrees of freedom , thus effectively suppressing the yield in any given momentum bin .",
    "nuclear initial state effects can however cause @xmath24 in some kinematical regions @xcite .",
    "experimentally , @xmath19 can readily be obtained with respect to the angle @xmath21 of a hard hadron with the bulk matter @xmath25 event plane where @xmath25 is the @xmath26th coefficient in a harmonic expansion @xmath27 of the angular distribution of the bulk particle yield @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath19 is obtained as a function of @xmath29 , then the spread @xmath30 between in plane and out of plane emission is an important observable sensitive to the medium geometry .",
    "knowledge of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is approximately equivalent to angular averaged @xmath19 and the second harmonic coefficient @xmath7 at high @xmath0 , since _ if the modulation is a pure second harmonic _",
    "@xmath33 with @xmath19 the angular averaged value .",
    "colloquially @xmath7 is frequently referred to as elliptic flow coefficient , but this is highly misleading at high @xmath0  the angular modulation is not driven by any flow phenomenon but by the different strength of parton - medium interaction dependent on the density and size of traversed matter .",
    "the attenuation is known to be a non - linear function of the traversed length , in particular no matter how strong any interaction with the medium , @xmath34 is always true .",
    "this implies that for sufficiently low values of the average @xmath19 and high @xmath7 , eq .",
    "( [ e - v2 ] ) can not be fulfilled and saturation leads to a distortion of the resulting angular structure from a pure @xmath7 modulation even if the matter distribution has a perfect second harmonic spatial eccentricity @xmath35 . at the minimum of @xmath19 at lhc at about @xmath36 gev , this creates a spurious @xmath37 for the model used in this study .",
    "since this is commonly done in the literature , we will in the following discuss @xmath21 dependent physics nevertheless in terms of @xmath7 with the above caveats in mind .",
    "in the following , we parametrize ntc by an expression    @xmath38 f(\\rho , \\alpha)\\ ] ]    with @xmath39 as in eq .",
    "( [ e - flow ] ) , @xmath40 a free parameter regulating the overall strength of the parton - medium interaction and @xmath41 characterizing the strength and region of influence of the ntc .",
    "we test @xmath42 mev and @xmath43 mev in the following as well as @xmath44 in the range from 0 to 3 .",
    "( [ e - qhat ] ) is applied to a 2 + 1d fluid dynamical simulation of the bulk matter evolution for 2.76 atev pbpb collisions @xcite . using the local temperature @xmath9 , the transport coefficient for every spacetime point dependent on the specific hard parton trajectory through the matter",
    "can be obtained .",
    "this medium is then probed by a hard partons in order to compute @xmath19 .",
    "we generate a distribution of hard partons based on leading order perturbative qcd expressions in a mc routine and initialize them in the transverse plane based on the binary collision probability distribution with a specified orientation with respect to the bulk @xmath7 event plane .",
    "parton - medium interaction is computed using the scenario yajem - de @xcite of the in - medium shower evolution code yajem @xcite which is an extension of the pyshow routine @xcite simulating the qcd scale evolution in vacuum , and the reader interested in details of the simulation is referred to these works .",
    "yajem - de is well tested against a number of different high @xmath0 observables both at rhic and lhc kinematics , among them also observables with multiparticle final states , e.g. the dijet imbalance @xcite and jet - hadron @xcite correlations .",
    "however , it should be stressed that this is not of great relevance for the present work where we are interested in the relative change of qhat and @xmath7 due to ntc .",
    "results of a systematic investigation of jet quenching with respect to different hydrodynamical background assumptions in @xcite indicate that the relative change in high @xmath0 @xmath7 driven by properties of the fluid dynamics is with an accuracy better than 10% independent of the parton - medium interaction model used .",
    "@xmath45 is determined for any selection of @xmath44 and @xmath46 by fitting @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ e - qhat ] ) to the angular averaged @xmath19 in 0 - 10% central collisions to alice charged hadron data @xcite at @xmath47 gev .",
    "[ f - qhat ] shows the curves of @xmath48 resulting from these fits for the various scenarios in comparison with the default ansatz @xmath49 , assuming that jets decouple from bulk matter at the hypersurface characterized by @xmath50 gev .    from the results ,",
    "it becomes clear that the high @xmath9 determination of @xmath1 has no strong uncertainty associated with the near-@xmath6 behaviour of quenching .",
    "all scenarios find a stable value of @xmath51 to 2.5 gev .",
    "this value is well in line with other model results @xcite .",
    "turning the argument around , one finds that as expected the near @xmath6 dynamics is not constrained by fitting angular averaged @xmath19 .",
    "the main uncertainty for a reliable determination of @xmath1 still comes from the details of the fluid dynamical evolution @xcite . for illlustration , assuming that hard partons decouple from the medium at a temperature of @xmath52 gev , the qualitative picture stays the same , but instead @xmath53 to 4.1 is found at high @xmath9 for the various scenarios .",
    "one can safely conclude that knowledge of matter geometry is currently the largest uncertainty for a determination of @xmath1 .",
    "in order to assess the importance of ntc for the magnitude of @xmath7 at high @xmath0 , we leave @xmath45 as determined by the mean @xmath19 in central collisions as described above and use the same fluid dynamics computation for 30 - 40% centrality . at @xmath47 gev , we compute @xmath54 and fit the expression @xmath55 to the result . as discussed above , this is not a perfect fit as there is a @xmath56 modulation created by the non - linearity of the suppression with the matter density and size .",
    "nevertheless , for this work we only focus on the @xmath7 coefficient .",
    "we repeat this procedure for every ntc scenario and plot the relative enhancement over the default assumption @xmath4 ( which corresponds to a reduction of quenching near @xmath6 ) .",
    "note again that only the relative enhancement is meaningful at this stage  the absolute value of @xmath7 obtained in the computation depends on multiple factors , among them the pathlength dependence of the jet - medium interaction and the importance of quantum coherence effects , the initial eccentricity distribution of the matter , the amount of viscous entropy production dependent on the value of viscosity over entropy density @xmath57 or the precise choice of the decoupling surface for jets from the medium @xcite . by considering the relative enhancement only",
    ", many of these uncertainties approximatey drop out .    the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - v2 ] . a few observations",
    "can readily be made : first , for all scenarios tested , the highest enhancement found is 35% .",
    "this is sizable and comparable with e.g. the combined effect of slow thermalization and viscous entropy production @xcite , but smaller than the influence of the spacetime extent of the medium . for weak coupling scenarios @xcite which tend to underpredict @xmath7 at high @xmath0 , ntc is favoured but can not unambiguously be identified as the one dominating factor .",
    "second , about half of the possible effect already results from not having a reduction of quenching around @xmath6 , larger values of @xmath44 corresponding to more pronounced enhancement still increase @xmath7 , but there are indications for a saturation .",
    "third , and perhaps not surprisingly , the effect of ntc is more pronounced the more ntc is probed by the hard parton .",
    "both when the evolution is carried to a lowerdecoupling temperature and when the region in which ntc is effective is increased , a higher relative enhancement of @xmath7 is found .",
    "in this work , the effect of a near @xmath6 enhancement of the parton - medium interaction on both the extraction of the transport coefficient @xmath1 in central collisions and the enhancement of @xmath7 in non - central collisions has been investigated .",
    "the results have been obtained in a well - constrained and realistic model combination of fluid dynamics and parton - medium interactions , but given previous systematic investigations across different models @xcite there is reason to expect that relative effect magnitudes are more generally valid .",
    "it was found that the extraction of a value for @xmath5 from @xmath19 in central collisions in the high temperature region @xmath58 mev , i.e. where the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected to exist , is not substantially influenced by any assumptions about the near @xmath6 region .",
    "this is fortunate , as it allows to access the physics of the qgp without a full understanding of the phase transition and hadronization .",
    "however , other factors , for instance the uncertainty in the total size of the region in which parton and medium interact , pose still a challenge for any precision extraction .    in contrast , @xmath7 as found to be sensitive to ntc as suggested in @xcite on a level of a 35% enhancement .",
    "this is in line with the basic findings of @xcite that @xmath7 can generically be expected to increase when energy loss from the leading parton happens later . comparing weak coupling scenarios with data ,",
    "such an increase is certainly supported and indicates that ntc is favoured over a reduction of the interaction near @xmath6 .",
    "however given the sizable other systematic uncertainties affecting the absolute value of @xmath7 , it is difficult to tell whether ntc is required by the data and to unambiguously determine the size of the enhancement .",
    "most likely , an answer to this question will require a systematic picture across several different high @xmath0 observables and will be the topic of a future investigation ."
