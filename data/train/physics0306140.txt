    "resonances driven by the error field multipoles often show themselves as islands in phase plots of the particle motion .",
    "this happens when there is another non - linear field present , besides the error field multipoles , which produces a strong enough dependence of the tune on the amplitude of the particle motion .",
    "non - linear fields that produce a dependence of the tune on the ampliude can be the quadrupole fringe field , space charge fields and octupole correctors . in some cases it may be advantageous to introduce a non - linear field that produces a dependence of the tune on the amplitude of the particle motion . in order to be able to measure the strength of the island resonance , and then to correct it ,",
    "it is helpful to study how these resonances show themselves .",
    "in particular , one can study how the presence of the island resonances distort the tune dependence on the amplitude and the emittance growth caused by the island resonance .",
    "these effects are to some extent measureable , and can lead to a way to correct the resonance .",
    "islands in 4-dimensional phase space , unlike islands in 2-dimensional phase space , are not easy to visualize .",
    "this study will show how to visualize the islands in 4-dimensional phase space by studying the tune dependence on the amplitude of the particle .",
    "again , this effect is to some extent measureable , and can lead to a way to measure the strength of the resonance .",
    "this section will study an island resonance in 2-dimensional phase space , the @xmath0 resonance in the storage ring of the sns ( spallation neutron source at oak ridge ) .",
    "this resonance is driven by the random error sextupole , @xmath1 , in the magnets . in the absence of space charge forces , a non - linear field that produces an appreciable tune dependence on the amplitude of the particle motion",
    "is provided by the fringe field of the quadrupoles @xcite , which causes the tune to increase with the amplitude . starting with a zero amplitude tune of @xmath2 , @xmath3 ,",
    "one finds the phase space plot shown in fig .",
    "this plot was generated starting with @xmath4 , @xmath5 and then increasing @xmath6 in steps of 2 mm keeping @xmath5 and tracking the particle for 1000 turns for each @xmath6 .",
    "the tune starts below the resonance , and increases with amplitude .",
    "the islands appear when the tune reaches @xmath7 .",
    "the islands are reached when the initial amplitude is increased to @xmath8 , @xmath5 , which corresponds to an initial horizontal emittance of about @xmath9 mm.mrad .",
    "the distortion of the tune dependence on amplitude is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where the horizontal tune is plotted against @xmath10 .",
    "[ fig2 ] is generated by doing a search along the @xmath5 direction , increasing @xmath6 in steps of 2 mm .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a flat region where @xmath7 which will be seen to indicate the region where @xmath11 is crossing the island .",
    "when @xmath11 are inside the island , the paticle motion is doing a slow oscilation around the fixed point at the center of the island .",
    "the particle motion then contains more than one tune , and the tune with the largest ampltude is the tune of the fixed point , 6.3333 . inside the island , the tune shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , is this tune with the largest amplitude .",
    "one can verify that the beginning and the end of the flat region occur at the same @xmath10 which correpond to the borders of the islands along the @xmath5 direction .",
    "[ fig2 ] can be used to find the width of the island along the @xmath5 direction which is given by the width of the flat region in fig .",
    "the islands generated by the @xmath12 resonance indicate a growth in the particle emittance .",
    "if one starts a particle inside the islands with the initial emittance @xmath10 , then as the particle moves around the fixed point , its emittance will change and reach the maximun value of @xmath13 .",
    "one can use as a measure of the emittance growth the quantity @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is plotted against @xmath10 in fig .",
    "it shows a maximun value for @xmath15 which can be used as a measure of the strength of the resonance .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] and fig .  [ fig3 ] can to some extent be measured experimentally to find a way to correct this resonance with sextupole correctors .",
    "an interesting plot that may corrrespond more closely to something that might be measured is to plot the emittance growth , @xmath15 vs the tune , @xmath16 .",
    "this plot can be found by combining fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] . in this plot",
    ", there is a peak in the emittance growth which occurs when @xmath16=6.3333 , the resonance tune .",
    "the peak could be used as a measure of the resonance strength to correct the resonance .    using the flat region in the tune dependence on amplitude along the @xmath17 direction to indicate the strength of the resonance can sometimes lead to an error in setting the strengths of the sextupole correctors . changing",
    "the strength of the correctors can cause the islands to move , and the width of the island as indicated by the flat region in the tune dependence on the amplitude may , for example , appear smaller because one is now crossing the island at a place where it is narrower . also , when the islands move the the emittance growth , @xmath15 may seem smaller . in order to avoid this error due to the movement of the islands when the corrector strengths are changed , one has to measure the tune dependence on amplitude along enough different directions in phase space so that one finds the largest width of the island and the largest emittance growth for the @xmath18 inside the island .",
    "the same sort of argument also applies in finding the emittance growth dependence on the amplitude . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , results are given found by going out along many directions in phase space .",
    "one needs just enough directions to cover one of the three islands in fig .",
    "here 6 directions were used in the region of phase space covered by one island .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that plots @xmath16 versus @xmath10 , for each @xmath10 there are now 6 points plotted corresponding to the 6 directions .",
    "points that have the tune , nux=6.3333 , lie inside the island.the width of the island in @xmath10 as given by the width of the points that lie on the nux=6.3333 line and is much larger than the width found using just the @xmath19=0 direction as it includes the direction that crosses the island close to where the island is widest . in the same way ,",
    "[ fig5 ] now shows the largest emittance growth for the @xmath18 that are inside the island .    in applying the above results to develope a procedure for using the correctors to correct a resonance , one will probably use a sample of the @xmath18 that is convenient for a particular ring and its injection system",
    "one would then measure either the tune or the emittance growth of enough particles in the sample to be able to find the width of the island from the tune measurement or the largest emittance growth for paticles in the sample .",
    "one has to have a large enough sample that one is not misled by the movement of the islands when the excitation of the correctors are changed . to measure the largest emittance growth for particles in the sample",
    ", one can measure the frequency spectrum of the betatron oscillations .",
    "particles inside an island will have the frequency that corresponds to the resonant tune 6.3333 .",
    "the largest amplitude found in the frequency spectrum for the resonant frequency , can be used as a measure of the largest emittance growth .",
    "something like this was done at rhic @xcite .",
    "the measurements can be done for a weak beam ( no space charge effects ) as it has been shown @xcite that the resonance correction for resonances generated by magnet errors in the absence of space charge will also work fairly well in the presence of space charge .",
    "an interesting plot that may corrrespond more closely to something that might be measured is to plot the emittance growth , @xmath15 vs the tune , @xmath16 .",
    "this plot can be found by combining fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5b ]    the correction of the island resonances for the @xmath12 example can be done with two sextupole correctors properly located around the ring.the two correctors can then be adjusted one at a time , and for each setting of the correctors , the island width can measured from the dependnce of the tune on the amplitude as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , or the dependence of the amplitude growth on the tune as shown by combining fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . simulating this procedure",
    "gives the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and fig .",
    "the emittance growth , the maximun depx , max , is reduced by almost a factor of 10 by the best setting of the correctors that was found .",
    "the theoretical result for the width of the island indicates that the width can be made zero when the correctors are set so that @xmath20=0 where @xmath20 is the stopband @xcite of the @xmath12 resonance due to the field errors in the magnets that are driving this resonance .",
    "according to the theoretical result the required setting of the correctors does not depend on the field producing the dependence of the tune on amplitude .",
    "this result is not useful for setting the correctors as the errors in the magnets are not known .",
    "however , this result helps to explain why the setting of the correctors in the absence of space charge fields will also correct the resonance when the space charge fields are present .",
    "it was found for the @xmath12 resonance that setting of the correctors to make @xmath20=0 will only reduce the emittance growth , the maximun @xmath15 , by a factor of about 3 instead of the factor of 10 found above .",
    "it was found that for the sns @xcite this weaker correction that makes @xmath20=0 was good enough to reduce the beam losses due to the resonance and space charge fields .",
    "this section will study an island resonance in 4-dimensional phase space , the @xmath21 in the storage ring of the sns ( spallation neutron source at oak ridge ) .",
    "this resonance is driven by the random error sextupole , @xmath1 , in the magnets . unlike , the @xmath12 resonance in 2-dimensional phase space , it is difficult to visualise the islands associated with the @xmath21 resonance by looking at the particle motion in 4-dimensional phase space .",
    "instead , we will look at the distortion due to the resonance on the dependence of the tune and the emittance growth on the amplitude of the particle motion . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 - 1 ] , the spread in total emittance , @xmath22 is plotted against the initial total emittance , @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the largest total emittance and @xmath25 is the smallest total emittance reached by particle with the initial coordinates , @xmath26 , and initial total emittance , @xmath23,tracked for 1000 turns .",
    "points were found along a particular direction in phase space given by @xmath17 , @xmath27 and @xmath28.the emittance spread becomes large in the region @xmath23=125 to @xmath23=300 , and this region may be used as a measure of the width of the island along this particular direction , @xmath17 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the low value of @xmath29 near the center of region shows that this particular direction goes close to the center of the island where we expect @xmath29=0 .",
    "[ fig3 - 2 ] shows the emittance growth , @xmath30 as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "the goal of a correction scheme would be to reduce the maximun value of @xmath31 in ths plot . in the 2-dimensional case of the @xmath12 resonance ,",
    "the plot of @xmath16 vs. @xmath10 had a flat region where @xmath16 had the constant value of 6.3333 which gave the width of the island .",
    "it was found for the @xmath32 resonance , a flat region would be found if we plotted @xmath33 vs. @xmath23 and the constant value in the flat region is @xmath32 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 - 3 ] .",
    "the width of the flat region coincides with the width of the island as found from fig .",

    "the particle motion contains more than one tune , and what is plotted in fig .",

    "[ fig3 - 3 ] and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 - 3b ] . in this plot",
    ", there is a peak in the emittance growth which occurs when @xmath21 .",
    "the peak could be used as a measure of the resonance strength to correct the resonance .    as in the 2-dimesional case , to correct the @xmath21 resonance , one has to repeat the above calculations for all directions in phase space that pass through a particular island , in order not to be misled by the movement of the islands when the correctors are changed .",

    "there are , then , 36 points for each value of @xmath23 .",
    "the results indicated by these figures for the width of the island and the maximun emittance growth are not too different from those found above where only one direction in phase space was used , as the particular direction used appears to pass close to the center of the island .",

    "the correction of the island resonances for the @xmath21 resonance can be done with two sextupole correctors properly located around the ring .",
    "assuming that one has a way to measure either the width of the island or the maximun emittance growth using the above results as a guide , then the two correctors can be adjusted one at a time to reduce the emittance growth or the island width .",
