    "the four thermodynamics laws of black hole , which were originally derived from the classical einstein equation , provide deep insight into the connection between thermodynamics and einstein equation@xcite@xcite . in _ jacobson _",

    ", the einstein equation can be regarded as the equation of state of spacetime . since _",
    "s work , many physicists have extended the connection between thermodynamics and gravity beyond the einstein gravity , including the so - called @xmath3 gravity@xcite@xcite and the scalar - tensor gravity@xcite .",
    "recently , the connection between thermodynamics of apparent horizon and friedmann equation in friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe has been shown@xcite@xcite . this connection has also been extended to braneworld cosmology , for related discussions see refs .",
    ". on the other hand , the thermodynamics of frw universe has also been studied in term of holographic principle@xcite .",
    "more recently , _ _ eling et al__@xcite found that it is impossible to derive the field equation of @xmath3 gravity from the clausius relation @xmath0 , in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics . in order to get the field equation in @xmath3 gravity ,",
    "an entropy production term has to be added to the clausius relation which is then changed to @xmath4 .",
    "similar cases have also occurred in the scalar - tensor theory@xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics behaviors in @xmath3 gravity and scalar - tensor gravity show that we have to treat these system with non - equilibrium thermodynamics , which are different with the equilibrium thermodynamics in einstein gravity . in ref .",
    ", by introducing a masslike function , the authors showed that the equilibrium thermodynamics on apparent horizon of frw universe can exist for more general theories of gravity , even including @xmath3 gravity , scalar - tensor gravity , and brans - dicke theory .",
    "the masslike function provides a new type first law of thermodynamics on apparent horizon of frw universe , which is obvious different with the conventional thermodynamical treatment of frw spacetime . then _ _ wu et al__@xcite proposed a general procedure to construct the first law of thermodynamics on apparent horizon in generalized gravity theories , and discussed a more general formulary for the masslike function .",
    "the validity of their procedure has been shown in @xmath3 gravity , lovelock gravity , scalar - tensor gravity , and also the randal - sundrum braneworld with bulk matter .    however , the universality of the procedure in a more general braneworld model has not been discussed . in this paper",

    "it is also interesting to explore whether and how the connection between thermodynamics associated with the masslike function and gravity theories be generalized to the braneworld scenarios .",
    "there are two motivations encourage us to address this issue .",
    "first , the new type first law of thermodynamics on apparent horizon which related to the masslike function is a geometric relation , @xmath7 where @xmath2 and @xmath8 are both geometric quantities .",
    "the energy flow through the apparent horizon is defined by a masslike function . in a general braneworld ,",
    "the curvature correction terms on the brane and in the bulk must affect the energy flow crossing the apparent horizon on the brane .",
    "in this case , does this geometric relation ( [ gr ] ) also hold when the curvature correction terms exist ? whether and how do the contribution of the curvature correction terms enter the expression of the masslike function ?",
    "these questions need to be answered .",
    "second , in the braneworld scenario , the gravity on the brane is not the einstein gravity , the extra dimension effect on the brane may also affect the masslike function . these non - trivial contributions to the masslike function provide an abundant physical meanings of the masslike function , this may give some clues to explore the physical meanings of the masslike function and the universal geometric relation ( [ gr ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we will discuss the connection between thermodynamics and the braneworld model .",
    "the new type first law of thermodynamics related to the masslike function will be investigated in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief introduction of the general procedure proposed by _ _",
    "wu et al__@xcite by generalizing it to the case of a frw universe with any spatial curvature . in section iii",
    ", we consider a frw universe on the brane , and construct the first law of thermodynamics on apparent horizon and calculate the entropy of apparent horizon in the general braneworld . in section iv , we investigate the universality of the geometric relation ( [ gr ] ) in the braneworld . the masslike function has been worked out .",
    "the physical meanings of the masslike function have also been explored .",
    "we end this paper with conclusion in section v.",
    "in this section , we will give a brief introduction of the general procedure that proposed by _",
    "wu et al _ by generalizing it to the case of a frw universe with any spatial curvature .",
    "let us start with an @xmath9-dimensional homogenous and isotropic frw universe , whose metric is @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the radius of the sphere , @xmath13 is the scale factor , and @xmath14 is the @xmath15-dimensional sphere element . here @xmath16diag@xmath17 is the @xmath18-dimensional metric , in which @xmath19 is the spatial curvature constant .",
    "the dynamical apparent horizon , a marginally trapped surface with vanishing expansion , is defined by @xmath20 , from this relation the radius of the apparent horizon reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the hubble parameter , @xmath23 , and for convenient , we define @xmath24 . here",
    "we set the dots represent derivatives with respect to the cosmic time @xmath25 .",
    "the associated temperature on the apparent horizon can be defined as @xmath26 in einstein gravity , the entropy is proportional to the horizon area @xmath27 where the horizon area @xmath28 , thus we have the fundamental relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the volume in the horizon . using the relation ( [ horizon ] )",
    ", we can obtain @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are pure geometric quantities , this implies that the above relation ( [ dr1 ] ) is a pure geometric relation .    for einstein gravity theories",
    ", one can write the friedmann equations in the form @xmath34 though we do not know the exact form of @xmath35 ( and @xmath36 ) , we know that there must be ordinary matter density @xmath37 in @xmath35 and also other quantities @xmath38 , such as matter or energy components besides the ordinary matter .",
    "for all gravity theories , the friedmann equation can be expressed in a generalized form @xmath39 it is obvious shown that @xmath40 is not only dependent on ordinary matter density @xmath41 , but also other quantities @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 in the general braneworld models , we will show in the next section that @xmath40 only dependent on the ordinary matter density @xmath41 , therefore , in the following discussions , we will restrict to consider this case only for simplicity . then the relation ( [ dr1 ] )",
    "can be changed to @xmath44 the expression of @xmath45 can be got from the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) . to construct the first law of thermodynamics @xmath46",
    ", we need to know the energy flux @xmath47 and entropy @xmath8 . in the general gravity theory , they are not specified .",
    "the energy flux of ordinary matter can be expressed as @xmath48 .",
    "multiplying @xmath49 on both sides of ( [ dr2 ] ) , we have @xmath50 in the general case , the conservation of the ordinary matter density can be written as @xmath51 substituting @xmath52 into eq.([dr3 ] ) , we can get @xmath53 the entropy form can be got by integrating ( [ dr4 ] ) .",
    "if there is just ordinary matter @xmath41 in the space , @xmath54 can be rewritten as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "then the entropy can be obtained by the integration @xmath56 so the entropy formulary is obviously dependent on @xmath57 .",
    "this is the crucial result which can be used to determine the exact entropy formulary for general braneworld models . then the relation ( [ dr4 ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "it is the first law of thermodynamics for the gravity theories with only freedom @xmath41 in the first friedmann equation .",
    "when @xmath40 is not only dependent on ordinary matter density @xmath41 , such as in @xmath3 gravity , scalar - tensor gravity , and also brans - dicke theory , the general expression of the first law of thermodynamics in the friedmann equation reads @xmath60 where @xmath61 is interesting since it relates to the entropy production in the non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "in this section , we will use the above procedure to investigate the thermodynamics properties of friedmann equation and the entropy formulary in general braneworld .",
    "we consider a @xmath62-brane embedded in a @xmath63-dimensional space - time . for convenience and without loss of generality",
    "we choose the extra dimension along the coordinates @xmath64 such that the brane is located at @xmath65 .",
    "objects corresponding to the brane are written with a tilde to be distinguished from @xmath6 objects .",

    "although the entropy formulary we obtained is the same as that obtained in ref .  , the expressions of the first law of thermodynamics on apparent horizon are different . in ref .",

    "as expected , the entropy formulary of apparent horizon obtained in this section is consistent with the entropy formulary obtained by _ _",
    "sheykhi et al__@xcite .",
    "now , we give some remarks about above discussions in order : ( i ) as pointed out in ref .  , the physical meaning of the entropy formulary ( [ entropy2 ] ) is obvious .",
    "the first term in ( [ entropy2 ] ) is bekenstein- hawking entropy on the brane , the second term obeys the 5-dimensional area formula in the bulk and the third term come off the contribution of the gauss - bonnet correction term .",
    "( ii ) the eq.([entropy2 ] ) is a very general entropy formulary in braneworld , it can reduce to the entropy of several special braneworld models@xcite .",
    "such as the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld is the limiting case when @xmath107 , the randall - sundrum ( rs ) ii braneworld in the limit @xmath108 and @xmath107 , the pure gauss - bonnet braneworld is the case with @xmath108 .",
    "in this section , we will begin to study the first law of thermodynamics associated with the masslike function and search for the expression of the masslike function in braneworld . as shown in ref .",
    ", the masslike function in @xmath109-dimensional einstein gravity reads @xmath110 using this masslike function , the first law of einstein gravity reads @xmath111 where @xmath112 is null ( approximate ) generator of the apparent horizon .",
    "the above expression plays a important role in determining the exact expression of the masslike function in modified gravity . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", this masslike function can be insteaded by a more generalized form . using eq.([dr4 ] )",
    ", the masslike function satisfied @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the @xmath9-dimensional masslike function , which reads @xmath115 and @xmath116 and also @xmath117 ( which will be defined bellow ) are arbitrary functions satisfying @xmath118 on the apparent horizon . from eq.([mass1 ] ) , we get @xmath119 noticing that @xmath95 and @xmath96 on the brane , substituting eq.([friedmann5 ] ) into eq.([m ] ) , the above formulary gives the exact expression of the masslike function @xmath120 in the braneworld , @xmath121 using this masslike function , the first law of the general braneworld now reads @xmath122 this result exactly has the same form as the one that we have given in the previous section .",
    "in addition , we would like to point out that , although eq.([first law2 ] ) and ( [ first law3 ] ) have the same form , the first law of thermodynamics expressed in eq.([first law3 ] ) is a new type thermodynamics and the corresponding physical meanings are different .",
    "first , the corresponding definition of the energy flow @xmath47 through apparent horizon are different .",
    "because of the masslike function , the energy flow @xmath47 defined in ( [ first law3 ] ) includes the contribution of gravitational field such as the gauss - boned term and bulk contribution in the general braneworld , in addition to the matter field on the brane .",
    "but in previous section , the energy flow @xmath47 is defined as the matter field energy crossing the apparent horizon within an infinitesimal of time @xmath123 .",
    "second , the universality of eq.([first law2 ] ) and ( [ first law3 ] ) are obvious different . in @xmath3 gravity and scalar - tensor",
    "theory@xcite , the equilibrium thermodynamics relation eq.([first law2 ] ) does not hold on apparent horizon for friedmann equation . in order to construct the thermodynamics of apparent horizon for friedmann equation",
    ", one has to modify the thermodynamics relation ( [ first law2 ] ) to nonequilibrium case by adding an entropy production term .",
    "but for the relation eq.([first law3 ] ) associated with the masslike function , its validity has been verified in various gravity theory@xcite , including @xmath3 gravity , scalar - tensor theory , gauss - bonnet gravity and more general loveloke gravity . and",
    "in this section , it also hold in the general braneworld model .",
    "the masslike function @xmath120 obtained above plays a important role in the thermodynamic description of the gravitational dynamics and determines the energy flows passing through the horizon . for a variety of theories of gravity",
    ", the masslike function reduces to the misner - sharp mass at the apparent horizon .",
    "therefore , the investigation of this mass - like function may shed lights on the misner - sharp mass of the braneworld . in order to conveniently discuss the physical meanings of the masslike function",
    ", we set @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and notice that @xmath20 on the apparent horizon , the masslike function @xmath120 reduces to @xmath126 it is obvious that this masslike function contains the contributions of the extra dimension and the gauss - bonnet correction term in the bulk .",
    "this means that the energy flows passing through the horizon on the brane may have some non - trivial connection with the extra dimension and the guass - bonnet curvature correction terms in the bulk .",
    "this non - trivial connection also has some interesting effects on the accelerated expansion of the universe@xcite@xcite .    in the context of dynamical black holes ,",
    "the dynamics of the black hole spacetime can be described by its quasi - local first law of thermodynamics , this thermodynamics associated with a quasi - local mass which determines the energy ( or mass ) of the trapping horizon of black holes@xcite@xcite . in general relativity , the quasi - local mass usually be selected as the misner - sharp mass@xcite@xcite .",
    "such quasi - local mass has also been generalized to the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity by hideki maeda and asato nozawa@xcite . in frw spacetime",
    ", the apparent horizon is an important trapping horizon , at this level , its thermodynamics coincides with the quasi - local thermodynamics of dynamical trapping horizons . for the models of braneworld considered in this paper , the new type first law of thermodynamics associated with masslike function is just the quasi - local first law of thermodynamics .",
    "this implies that the above masslike function ( [ mass ] ) should coincides with the quasi - local mass of apparent horizon , which can be regarded as the generalized misner - sharp mass in braneworlds .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamics of apparent horizon can provide an approach to investigate the properties of misner - sharp mass in the braneworlds .    from eq.([mass ] ) , we can obtain the masslike function of several special braneworld models :    ( i ) . in the limit @xmath127 , eq.([mass ] )",
    "reduces to the masslike function on the apparent horizon in the warped dgp braneworld embedded in an @xmath128 bulk @xmath129    ( ii ) .",
    "when in the limit @xmath127 and @xmath130 , eq.([mass ] ) reduces to the masslike function on the apparent horizon in pure dgp braneworld with a minkowskian bulk @xmath131    ( iii ) . in the limit @xmath127 and @xmath132 , while keeping @xmath133 finite , the first and the last terms in eq.([mass ] ) vanish and we obtain the masslike function on the apparent horizon in the rs ii braneworld @xmath134    ( iv ) . finally , keeping @xmath135 finite , and in the limit @xmath132 and @xmath136",
    ", we obtain the masslike function on the apparent horizon in the gauss - bonnet braneworld with a minkowskian bulk @xmath137 although , the connections between these masslike functions and misner - sharp mass are not very clear , it is predictable that these masslike functions may play an important role in investigating the misner - sharp mass in the braneworld .",
    "in this paper we have studied the thermodynamics of the apparent horizon of frw universe in a general braneworld model with curvature correction terms on the brane and in the bulk , respectively . using the general procedure developed by _",
    "wu et al _ , we have constructed the first law of thermodynamics on apparent horizon of frw universe and obtained the exact entropy formulary of apparent horizon in the braneworld . as expected , the entropy formulary we obtained is the same as the one obtained by _ _",
    "sheykhi et al__@xcite .",
    "we have also studied the first law of thermodynamics of apparent horizon associated with the masslike function in the braneworld .",
    "this is a new type first law of apparent horizon and it is a universality result in more generalized gravity theories .",
    "its validity in the braneworld has been verified .",
    "the difference between this new type first law of thermodynamics and the conventional first law of thermodynamics in the braneworld have also been discussed .",
    "we have also calculated the exact expression of the masslike function in the braneworld . as expected",
    ", the masslike function contains the contributions of the extra dimension and the guass - bonnet curvature correction terms in the bulk .",
    "this implies that the energy flow crossing the apparent horizon on the brane should contain the contributions from bulk and curvature correction terms .",
    "the physical meanings of the masslike function have been discussed in the context of quasi - local thermodynamics in the dynamical horizon . as like in the einstein gravity , @xmath3 gravity , and the lovelock gravity the masslike function reduces to the misner - sharp mass on apparent horizon , we concluded that the masslike function should also reduce to the generalized misner - sharp mass on apparent horizon in the braneworld .",
    "we noticed that in our construction of first law of thermodynamics in section iii , the energy conservation on the brane is assumed .",
    "this means that there is no interaction between extra dimension and the matter on the brane .",
