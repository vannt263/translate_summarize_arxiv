    "probabilistic models of directed polymers are often constructed as modifications of directed random walk models on a particular lattice . for the particular model that we study , directed polymers in a random environment ,",
    "the path probabilities are randomly perturbed by a gibbsian reweighting that is determined by each realization of the environment , and the strength of the perturbation is controlled by an inverse temperature parameter @xmath3 .",
    "broadly speaking , the main question of interest in such models is how the presence of the random environment affects these path probabilities , and to what degree any effect can be quantified .",
    "the values of @xmath3 for which the presence of the environment has no substantial effect are called the _ weak disorder regime _ , while those @xmath3 for which the environment has a meaningful influence make up the _ strong disorder regime_. the precise characterization of weak versus strong disorder is given in terms of the positivity of a martingale limit , the martingale being the normalized partition function associated with the model .",
    "in recent years there has been substantial attention paid to determining the exact structure of the weak and strong disorder regimes . on the integer lattice @xmath19 ( which is commonly referred to as @xmath20-dimensional to indicate that the polymer is directed ) it is known @xcite that there is a critical value @xmath21 such that @xmath22 is in the weak disorder regime and @xmath23 is in the strong disorder regime . when @xmath24 or @xmath25 it is known that the polymer is in the strong disorder regime for all finite temperatures ( i.e. @xmath26 ) , whereas for @xmath27 it is known that there is a non - trivial interval of finite temperatures that make up the weak disorder regime ( i.e. @xmath28 ) . in the latter case",
    "there are only bounds for the value of @xmath29 and how it depends on the dimension @xmath30 and the statistical distribution of the underlying environment .",
    "in contrast , for directed polymers on a self - similar tree there is an _ exact _",
    "characterization @xcite of the value of @xmath29 ( for any choice of the statistical distribution of the environment satisfying weak moment assumptions ) , and much more is known about the strong and weak disorder regimes @xcite .",
    "the tree model is easier to analyze because of the underlying geometry of the space , namely that the tree is self - similar and that paths , once they split , can never recombine . in particular",
    ", the non - recombining feature means that the random energies assigned to different paths are essentially independent after a long time , which is very different from what happens in the lattice case .",
    "recently a new phenomenon has emerged in directed polymer models : the _ intermediate disorder regime_. the terminology _ intermediate disorder _",
    "was first introduced in @xcite to indicate that it sits between weak and strong disorder , and the regime itself is accessed by scaling the inverse temperature @xmath3 towards its critical value as the size of the system goes to infinity . the correct scaling produces new and interesting behavior that is fundamentally different from what happens for strong and weak disorder . at the same time , the intermediate regime often contains a full range of models that act ( or are conjectured to act ) as a bridge between the two classical regimes .",
    "typically intermediate disorder is easier to study in situations where @xmath26 , since in this case the polymer model is only a small perturbation of the underlying random walk . in @xmath31",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the proper scaling for intermediate disorder is to replace @xmath3 with @xmath32 , and that under a diffusive scaling of space and time the entire random gibbs measure converges ( in law ) to a random measure on continuous paths called the continuum directed random polymer .",
    "properties of the continuum polymer were analyzed in @xcite , but it is important to note that the continuum polymer is actually an entire _ family _ of models indexed by the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "it is not yet understood how or even if this family acts as a bridge between weak and strong disorder , although encouraging results in this direction were obtained in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath33 the situation for intermediate disorder is largely open , and for @xmath27 it seems that little has been done for scalings around @xmath29 . a model somewhat similar to the @xmath31 case , the _ continuum disordered pinning model _ ( cdpm ) , was considered in @xcite .",
    "again in that case @xmath26 , and the authors were able to determine the precise scaling for intermediate disorder and take a scaling limit of the random gibbs measure . in the tree case , where @xmath28 , the proper scaling window for the intermediate disorder regime was determined in @xcite ,",
    "although nothing could be said about infinite volume limits of the corresponding gibbs measures .",
    "in this paper we study intermediate disorder on the _ diamond hierarchical lattice_. this particular lattice has an interesting geometrical structure that still possesses a self - similarity like the tree does , but at the same time allows paths to reintersect like they do on @xmath19 . in this sense",
    "the diamond lattice is a natural generalization of the tree but in many important ways is actually more like @xmath19 , and for the polymer model with site disorder ( which is what we consider ) this is especially true .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 1.1 ) for a convincing argument in favor of this viewpoint .",
    "the structure of the diamond lattice is controlled by two parameters @xmath34 : the _ branching number _ and the _ segment number_. the `` lattice '' is actually a sequence of graphs constructed by a recursive procedure determined by the branching and segment numbers , and the depth of the recursive determines the length of the polymer . for directed polymers on the diamond lattice",
    "it was proved in @xcite that there is a @xmath29 that strictly separates weak disorder from strong disorder , as in the @xmath20-dimensional case , and that @xmath26 for @xmath35 while @xmath28 for @xmath36 .",
    "these results are precisely summarized in section [ secmain ] .",
    "our main focus is on the intermediate disorder regime in the @xmath7 and @xmath37 cases , i.e. , when @xmath26 , which exhibit widely disparate behaviors .",
    "our analysis , in a sense , extends the results of @xcite to obtain a richer description of the phase diagram around the critical point . in the case @xmath7",
    ", one sees through a simple taylor expansion of the partition function that the correct intermediate disorder scaling is to replace @xmath3 with @xmath38 for a parameter @xmath10 ; see section  [ secheuristic ] . similarly to the @xmath39-dimensional polymer and the continuum disordered pinning model , we find that there is a one - parameter family of limit laws @xmath12 for the normalized partition functions of the model .",
    "the limiting family depends continuously on @xmath13 and for @xmath40 satisfies    * for @xmath41 , @xmath12 is approximately a normal distribution with mean @xmath42 and variance @xmath43 . *",
    "if @xmath44 are independent random variables with distribution @xmath12 , then @xmath45    as in @xcite the limiting law appears as a _ universal _",
    "object , i.e. the same limit appears for any disorder variables with exponential moments that obey proper normalization constraints , but the limit itself is not gaussian .",
    "furthermore these limiting laws can be used to construct a continuum diffusion process interacting with a random environment on the continuum diamond lattice , similar to what is done in @xcite .",
    "this is discussed in section [ secb < s ] .",
    "we emphasize that in contrast to @xcite our methods for showing the existence of these limit laws and their universality properties do not use polynomial chaos expansions ; instead they come from renormalization group type ideas .",
    "in the case @xmath8 , nontrivial behavior emerges in the intermediate disorder regime by replacing @xmath3 with @xmath46 , but in contrast to the @xmath39-dimensional polymer and the cdpm the parameter @xmath13 does not seem to act as any sort of bridge .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath37 case , there is a critical value @xmath47 such that the variance of the rescaled partition function converges to zero with large @xmath6 for @xmath48 , but also grows to infinity for @xmath49 .",
    "this is discussed in section [ secweakdisorder ] .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ secmain ] we give a full description of the model and precisely state our main results . in section [ secdef ]",
    "we describe our coordinate system for the diamond lattice and use it to derive recursive formulas for moments of the partition function .",
    "we especially point out section [ secheuristic ] , which gives some heuristic reasoning for the choice of scalings @xmath50 and @xmath46 in the @xmath40 and @xmath37 cases , respectively .",
    "section  [ secb < s ] contains a proof of a limit theorem for the normalized partition function in the @xmath7 case , and section [ secweakdisorder ] contains our results on the @xmath8 case . in sections  [ secnormalweakdisorder ] and  [ secedgemodel ]",
    "we give , respectively , very brief discussions of the @xmath51 case and the equivalent model in the @xmath8 case in which random weights are placed on the bonds of the graph rather than the sites . finally , we relegate proofs that are particularly calculus - based to section  [ secmiscproofs ] .",
