    "recently , a coherence theory has been established by regarding it as a physical resource @xcite . spirited by the rapid development of quantum coherence theory @xcite , some important questions naturally arise : ( 1 ) what s the behavior of the coherence in a realistic system at a macroscopic level and how to experimentally detect the macroscopic coherence ?

    "we find that : ( 1 ) with the increase of the single - photon optomechanical coupling strength , both the mechanical coherence and the total optomechanical coherence are strengthened , while the optical coherence is suppressed ; ( 2 ) three kinds of the coherence mentioned above are very sensitive to the cavity decay , but are robust to the decay of the mechanical resonator ; ( 3 ) the difference between the total optomechanical coherence and the sum of the optical and the mechanical coherence just equals their quantum mutual information ; ( 4 ) the macroscopically optomechanical coherence can be detected in an all - optical setup .",

    "the optical field is subject to the zero - point fluctuation from the vacuum environment , while the mechanical subsystem is subject to the thermal noise from its bath . from this point of view",
    ", it is expected that the optical field , which is in a much less incoherent environment than that of the mechanical resonator , should have a larger degree of coherence .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ figb](c ) that the total coherence @xmath65 increases with the optomechanical coupling @xmath11 .",

    "[ figb](a ) goes up at the same time .",
    "let us discuss this counter - intuitive result more carefully .",
    "for the parameters in fig .",
    "[ figb ] , we find that the optomechanical system operates in the red - detuned regime @xmath76 with the resolved side - band condition @xmath77 . in this case , the optomechanical interaction is of the form of beam splitter in the rotating wave approximation @xcite . as a result",
    ", the coherence should transfer from the optical mode into the mechanical mode because @xmath75 .",
    "it is consistent with the expectation that the optical coherence @xmath64 should decrease with the increase of the optomechanical coupling @xmath11 .",
    "we also consider the asymptotical behavior of the quantum coherence in terms of the driving field @xmath12 . in the regime @xmath78 ,",
    "the nonzero elements of the covariance matrix for the mechanical mode are given as @xcite @xmath79 within the rotation wave approximation .",
    "in the case , the quantum coherence of the mechanical resonator can be approximated as @xmath80 with @xmath81 in the large @xmath12 limit and @xmath82 in the limit @xmath83 ( the definitions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 are given in the appendix ) .",
    "similarly , the coherence of the optical mode is obtained as @xmath86 in the same limits as that of @xmath63 .",
    "note that in most of the realistically optomechanical systems , the single - photon coupling strength @xmath11 is much smaller than the cavity decay rate @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the driving strength @xmath12 must be a finite value which is restricted by the limited laser power and required by the stability of the system .",
    "thus , for the typical parameters in the optomechanical experiments , the optical coherence @xmath64 should be larger than the mechanical coherence @xmath63 .      we also explore the effect of the dissipation channels on the optomechanical coherence . for the optomechanical system ,",
    "the main dissipation channels are the thermal damping of the mechanical mode and the cavity decay .",
    "we find all the three kinds of quantum coherence(@xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ) are very robust to the mechanical damping rate : with the increase of the damping rate from @xmath87 to @xmath70 , nevertheless all the values of the three kinds of coherence are suppressed , we do not observe their noticeable changes .",
    "[ figc ] exhibits the role of the cavity decay on the quantum coherence .",
    "different from the case of @xmath88 , the cavity decay rate @xmath14 spoils all the three kinds of coherence obviously .",
    "moreover , @xmath63 is more sensitive in terms of @xmath14 than @xmath64 : with the increase of the cavity decay rate from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , the value of @xmath64 only drops half , while that of @xmath63 decreases considerably and even approaches zero .",
    "this result implies that the mechanical coherence can be controlled by the optical field .",
    "the behavior of the optomechanical coherence @xmath65 is rather similar to @xmath64 , so its figure is omitted here .",
    "[ figa ] shows the role of the mean thermal phonon number @xmath91 on the coherence .",
    "the behaviors of this figure are consistent with our expectation : with the increase of @xmath91 , all the three kinds of coherence drop down . physically , the thermal excitation should be an incoherent operation in general .",
    "it s interesting here that with the optomechanical coupling , the incoherent channel of the mechanical resonator can affect the optical coherence through the optomechanical interaction .",
    "this result indicts that one could manipulate the coherence of a subsystem by adjusting its remote correlated counterpart .     as a function of the driving strength @xmath12 and the optomechanical - coupling strength @xmath11 ( both @xmath12 and @xmath11",

    "<S> we also find that the difference between the total optomechanical coherence and the sum of the optical and the mechanical coherence just equals their mutual information . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the detection of the optomechanical entanglement , an experimentally feasible scheme to probe the optomechanical coherence is proposed . </S>"
