    "in liquid state nmr quantum computing ( nmr qc ) , two - qubit gates are implemented through the @xmath2-coupling between spins . throughout this paper , we assume that the @xmath2-coupling tensor is isotropic in an isotropic liquid , and hence represented by a scalar coupling constant . to realize a selective two - qubit gate in a system with more than two spins , it is necessary to effectively suppress those spin - spin interactions that do not participate in gate operation .",
    "consider for example a molecule in which three linearly aligned spins are employed as qubits . in nmr qc , a selective two - qubit gate between qubits 2 and 3 is conventionally implemented by a refocusing procedure @xcite in which a pair of hard ( i.e. , short ) @xmath0-pulses are applied to qubit 1 .",
    "this method works well for heteronuclear molecules . when the molecule is homonuclear",
    ", however , the hard pulses applied to qubit 1 often induce unwanted @xmath1-rotations on qubits 2 and 3 , even if the @xmath1-components of qubits 2 and 3 are left unchanged .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the transient bloch - siegert ( bs ) effect @xcite . since only a few spin",
    "one - half nuclear species suitable for nmr qc are known , a fully heteronuclear molecule with a large number of qubits is unfeasible ; quantum computers with more than three qubits usually involve homonuclear dynamics @xcite .",
    "quantification of and compensation for the bs shifts are therefore essential for precise gate operation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : hardpulses ] , we summarize the standard refocusing technique and the associated issues . in section  [ sec : proposal ] , we propose an alternative method to obtain a selective two - qubit gate by applying a weak square pulse to qubit 1 .",
    "we show that the bs effect is significantly reduced due to the small ratio of the pulse amplitude and the detuning parameter , making this method suitable for both hetero- and homonuclear molecules . in section  [ sec : fidelity ] , we relax some of our assumptions to consider the full time evolution operator ; we evaluate the propagator fidelity for the soft pulse method , and compare it with the fidelity obtained by numerical optimization of the conventional refocusing scheme . in section  [ sec : experiment ] we provide a concrete example of an experiment in which we employed the proposed soft pulse . in section  [ sec :",
    "conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we consider a three - spin linear chain molecule .",
    "a radio frequency ( rf ) field with a tunable amplitude @xmath3 is applied along the @xmath4-axis of qubit 1 ; for the time being , we will ignore the coupling between the rf - field and qubits 2 and 3 .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian of the molecule in the rotating frame of each qubit is @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the unit matrix of order 2 , and @xmath7 , where with @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) we denote the components of the pauli vector .",
    "the spin - spin coupling strengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 are fixed and always active in nmr qc . throughout this paper , we assume that the interaction between spins 1 and 3 ( @xmath12 ) is negligibly small .    suppose we want to apply a two - qubit gate between spins 2 and 3 .",
    "then we need an entanglement operator of the form @xmath13 where the nonvanishing constant @xmath14 depends on the particular gate we are to implement ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "free evolution ( @xmath15 ) of the system under the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) for a duration @xmath16 generates @xmath17 to implement the operator ( [ gate ] ) , we need to remove the first factor in the right hand side of ( [ error ] ) by effectively eliminating the action of the @xmath10 coupling term .",
    "a standard nmr qc refocusing approach is to apply a pair of @xmath0-pulses of duration @xmath18 along the @xmath4-axis of the first spin , separated by a time interval @xmath19 of free precession .",
    "the time evolution reads ,    @xmath20    if the @xmath0-pulses are ` hard ' , _ i.e. _ , so short that the @xmath2-coupling time evolution during the application of each pulse is negligible , ( [ eq : ps ] ) is reduced to @xmath21 here @xmath22 denotes a @xmath0-pulse applied along the @xmath4-axis of the first spin , generated by the first term of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : kill ] ) shows that , in the vanishing pulse width limit , the unwanted factor in the right hand side of ( [ error ] ) is completely removed .",
    "note that the global phase factor @xmath23 is irrelevant .",
    "this scheme works well for heteronuclear molecules , for which the larmor frequencies of the spins are widely different , and hard pulses applied to qubit 1 have practically no crosstalk to the remaining qubits .    when the molecule is homonuclear , on the other hand , the couplings between the rf - field and qubits 2 and 3 must be taken into account .",
    "then the @xmath0-pulses often induce unwanted @xmath1-rotations in qubits 2 and 3 ( transient bloch - siegert effect ) .",
    "suppose an @xmath24 pulse with duration @xmath25 and amplitude @xmath3 is applied to spin 1 .",
    "let @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) be the difference between the larmor frequencies of qubits 1 and @xmath28 , and let @xmath29 .",
    "we require @xmath30 so that the pulse is localized enough in the frequency domain compared to @xmath31 and , at the same time , @xmath32 so that the effect of the @xmath2-coupling on the time evolution is negligible for the duration of each pulse .",
    "the latter condition is typically satisfied to a first approximation for both hetero- and homonuclear molecules ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    to derive the bs phase",
    ", we describe the system in the frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath33 - the larmor frequency of qubit 1 - which we call the common rotating frame @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24-pulse has the rf - frequency @xmath34 .",
    "looked upon from qubit @xmath28 ( @xmath27 ) , whose larmor frequency is @xmath35 , the rf - pulse is detuned from @xmath35 by @xmath36 .",
    "the effective one - qubit hamiltonian acting on qubit @xmath28 in this frame is @xmath37 where @xmath38 suppose the detuning @xmath36 is large enough compared to @xmath39 so that @xmath40",
    ". then it follows that @xmath41 , and the time evolution operator acting on qubit @xmath28 in this frame takes the form @xmath42 where we kept @xmath43 in the exponent since time @xmath44 can be a large number .",
    "one might naively think the detuning @xmath36 brings about the unitary operator @xmath45 acting on qubit @xmath28 in the frame rotating with @xmath46 .",
    "in reality , however , the rf - field applied to qubit 1 induces an extra rotation angle @xmath47 around the @xmath1-axis of qubit @xmath28 , which affects the coordinate system fixed to qubit @xmath28 .",
