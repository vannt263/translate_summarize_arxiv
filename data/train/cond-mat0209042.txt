    "the interaction of an optically generated exciton with excess carriers in the conduction band has been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "especially the high density regime attracted much attention and is qualitatively understood @xcite : dynamical screening and pauli blocking prohibit the formation of bound @xmath0  @xcite states , the exciton is therefore unstable and its spectral weight distributed among @xmath0 scattering states .",
    "residual correlations between the valence band ( vb ) hole and conduction band ( cb ) electrons are still important , however , and , depending on the cb electron to vb hole mass ratio , give rise to a more or less pronounced fermi edge singularity  @xcite , for instance , in optical absorption spectra .    with the seminal experiment of kheng et al .",

[ [ fig1 ] ] .",
    "the photogenerated vb hole scatters from one momentum state to another and simultaneously excites a virtual @xmath2 pair ( recall our notation  @xcite ) to compensate for the momentum transfer . at low densities , the coulomb interaction is strong enough to correlate the vb hole with two cb electrons ( the photoexcited cb electron and the cb electron from the @xmath2 pair ) and a ( negatively charged ) trion appears . at higher cb electron densities , an",
    "_ arbitrary _ number of @xmath2 pairs is excited , giving rise to , among others , the screening of the coulomb interaction .",
    "at some density , the coulomb interaction is then too weak to support trions and/or excitons , but the residual correlations might produce a fermi edge singularity .",
    "the close connection between trion formation at low densities and the appearance of the fermi edge singularity at high densities has been verified experimentaly  @xcite but , so far , a unified theoretical description of the full density dependence of the optical susceptibility , based , e.g. , on the qualitative considerations of the previous paragraph , is still missing .",
    "to construct such a theory is a rather formidable task . here , we focus therefore on the low density regime , where the cluster meanfield approximation ( cmfa )  @xcite can be effectively used to calculate the optical susceptibility .",
    "@xcite in contrast to early theoretical studies of trion states  @xcite , the cmfa describes trion and exciton states simultaneously .",
