    "the triple point case presents two different subcases , linked to the multiplicity of the curve : it can decrease or not .",
    "this information is extremely useful for the study of the index evolution because it identifies the right exceptional divisor that will occur in the next triple point .",
    "now we observe that if at the end of a process @xmath251 we find a double point and the curve is desingularized we are in the geometric conditions of a @xmath39 point .",
    "the indices are the ones given by equation and by propositions [ propos : c1 ] and [ propos : restanti ] we can estimate them in such a way they became : @xmath252}\\\\ & { \\mbox {   \\hbox{ind}}}({\\mbox {   $ \\mathcal{f } $ } } , d , p)\\in { \\mbox { $ \\mathbb { q}$}}_{\\leq \\frac{1}{(x+y)^2k + ( x+y)(a+b ) } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so @xmath2 is a @xmath39 point .",
    "otherwise we are not in the right geometric conditions , i.e. the resolution is not just ended , but the same propositions gives indices : @xmath252m_n^2}\\\\ & { \\mbox {   \\hbox{ind}}}({\\mbox {   $ \\mathcal{f } $ } } , d , p)\\in { \\mbox { $ \\mathbb { q}$}}_{\\leq \\frac{1}{(x+y)^2k + ( x+y)(a+b ) } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so we have indices exactly of the form of the ones associated to a process @xmath253 and",
    "then we can apply all the previous argument to the new process which is starting .",
    "such process terminates after a finite number of blows - up by theorem of resolution of singularities @xcite .",
    "the demonstrative method used to get theorem [ teor : miomio ] allows us to generalize to the case in which we start with more than one separatrix :    [ propos : mio2 ] let be a two dimensional complex manifold , an holomorphic foliation on and @xmath254 separatrices of passing through a point @xmath255 .",
    "let assume that @xmath256 are non singular and transverse each other and to @xmath257 . if , besides , the indices are of the sequent form : @xmath258 then another separatrix through @xmath2 exists .    we prove that @xmath2 is an appropriate singularity .",
    "we observe that after the first blow - up , if we have not finished , we have the same indices found in the study made to prove theorem [ teor : miomio ] and so we conclude with the same argument .",
    "we blow - up @xmath0 in @xmath2 .",
    "if the exceptional divisor is not a separatrix for the saturated foliation , proposition @xmath259 in @xcite@xmath260pag.15@xmath261 concludes . otherwise using the index theorem @xmath260see @xcite@xmath261 and remembering that @xmath262",
    ", we obtain the existence of a singularity @xmath263 of the saturated foliation @xmath264 such that @xmath265 and then by theorem [ teor : miomio ] we have the existence of another separatrix for @xmath263 that projects in a separatrix for in .",
