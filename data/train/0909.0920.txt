    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates in a periodic potential created by interference of laser beams , called an optical lattice @xcite , opened up the possibility of studying the properties of ultra cold atoms in a variety of conditions .",
    "examples are the access to strongly interacting atomic regimes @xcite and to states which are fundamental for applications in quantum information @xcite .",
    "these systems have proven to be a rich research field that offer the unique possibility to investigate fundamental questions from condensed matter physics to quantum optics .",
    "a bose - einstein condensate in an optical lattice is nearly a perfect physical realization of the bose - hubbard model , a fact first pointed out by jaksch and coworkers @xcite .",
    "this model gives a description of the physics of interacting bosonic atoms trapped in a lattice potential with atomic tunneling between nearest neighbors and on - site repulsion .",
    "the main advantage of these systems is that they are highly controllable . as an example , when the ratio between the interaction and hopping terms is varied by changing the laser intensity , a quantum phase transition from a superfluid phase to a mott insulator phase",
    "is observed @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use the bose - hubbard model and the bogoliubov theory to study the dynamical and energetic stabilities of bose - einstein condensates loaded in a periodic ring .",
    "the dynamical and energetic stability of condensates in optical lattices have been investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a complete and self - contained description of the properties of condensates , its excitation spectrum and stability .",
    "briefly , we characterize the condensates by the quasimomenta of occupied states which reveals the existence of equilibrium current carrying condensates @xcite , we analyze the coupling structure of the effective quadratic grand - canonical hamiltonian in the quasimomenta basis which allowed us to establish the composition of the elementary excitations , the doublet structure of excitation energy branch and the proper assignment of the zero - energy mode @xcite and the phonon limit .",
    "we find that in the zero - energy mode , which is a direct consequence of the atom number violation by the bogoliubov theory , the quasimomenta of the atoms are identical to the quasimomentum of the occupied state in the condensate .",
    "turning to the phonon limit we find that it is achieved when the relative quasimomentum @xmath0 goes to zero , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being , respectively , the quasimomenta of the excitation and of the occupied state in the condensate , a fact overlooked in the literature @xcite .",
    "the stability of the condensates is determined by the behavior of the excitation energies and composition of the elementary excitations in the control parameters space .",
    "in fact an equilibrium state is dynamically stable if all excitation energies are real , @xcite , and it is energetically stable if they are positive , @xcite . in our study",
    "we identify two mechanisms of energetic instability :  crossing \" that occurs when the excitation energy vanishes and change its sign and  no - crossing \" that occurs when the excitation energy is strictly negative , independently of the control parameters . from this analysis",
    "we determine the domains in the control parameters space where it is possible to find metastability in the system , that is , dynamically and energetically stable condensates .",
    "metastable current carrying condensates correspond to local minima of the energy and they are candidates to present superfluid motion @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in the section",
    "ii we derive and solve the gross - pitaevskii equation for the bose - hubbard model to show that the atoms condense in states with well - defined quasimomentum @xcite , revealing the existence of equilibrium current carrying states @xcite .",
    "besides , these states with well - defined quasimomentum define a single - particle basis which diagonalizes the hopping term of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian . in the section iii we determine the energies and the composition of the elementary excitations by the diagonalization of the effective grand - canonical hamiltonian of the bogoliubov theory .",
    "we express it in the quasimomentum representation to show that only pairs of quasimomenta are coupled .",
    "we identify these pairs to cast the effective grand - canonical hamiltonian into the form of a sum of terms each one involving pairs of identical and distinct quasimomenta .",
    "this fact allow us to reduce the process of diagonalization of a @xmath3 matrix , with @xmath4 being the number of lattice sites , to one of @xmath5 matrices when the quasimomenta of the pairs are identical and @xmath6 matrices when they are distinct , which implies that the effective grand - canonical hamiltonian is diagonal in blocks .",
    "in fact , when @xmath4 is odd , we have @xmath7 pairs with distinct quasimomenta and only one pair with identical . on the other hand , for @xmath4 even , we have @xmath8 pairs with distinct quasimomenta and two pairs with identical .",
    "we will see that @xmath5 blocks correspond to one excitation energy whereas @xmath6 blocks correspond to doublets .",
    "in the section iv we determine the dynamical and energetic stability of the condensates by studying the behavior of excitation spectrum and the composition of the elementary excitations in the control parameters space .",
    "we found that the stability properties of the condensates depend only on a combination of control parameters @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the density of atoms , the hopping and the on - site strenghts . we determine critical values of @xmath13 that define , in the control parameters space , the domains where it is possible to find superflow states in the system .",
    "the dynamical and energetic phase diagrams are shown .",
    "a summary and our conclusions are presented in the section v.",
    "the physics of an ultra cold , dilute and interacting bose gas in a lattice potential is captured by the bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "this model can be seen as an one - mode approximation that involves the states in the first band of the optical lattice . in the tight - binding approximation , the homogeneous bose - hubbard hamiltonian for a system of bosons in a periodic circular array with @xmath4 sites",
    "is given by @xcite    @xmath14    in ( [ eq : bose - hubbard ] ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , bosonic annihilation and creation operators of atoms on the @xmath17th lattice site and @xmath18 is the atom number operator that counts the number of atoms on the @xmath17th lattice site .",
    "these operators satisfy the periodic boundary condition @xmath19 .",
    "the first term in bose - hubbard hamiltonian is the hopping term that describes the tunnelling of atoms among neighboring lattice sites with hopping strength @xmath11 and its effect is to delocalize the atoms over the lattice .",
    "the second term describes the inter - atomic on - site repulsion with interaction strength @xmath12 whose effect is to localize the atoms on the sites .      in a condensate",
    "all atoms are in the same single - particle state and therefore the many - body state can be written as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the creation operator of the state occupied by the atoms    @xmath22 which requires that the complex parameters @xmath23 must satisfy the constraint    @xmath24    the parameters @xmath23 are determined by a variational principle in which we minimize the mean value of @xmath25 in the boson condensate @xmath26 , given by ( [ eq : condensate_state ] ) , subject to the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) .",
    "the minimization lead us to the equation    @xmath27    which is the gross - pitaevskii equation for the bose - hubbard model with @xmath28 being the chemical potential .",
    "a solution of this equation that satisfy the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) has the general form    @xmath29 and , from ( [ eq : gpe_conserving ] ) , the chemical potential takes the explicit form    @xmath30    the possible values of @xmath31 are fixed by the periodic boundary condition @xmath32 which requires that @xmath33 .",
    "this equation has @xmath4 solutions which are the @xmath4th roots of unity , that is , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an integer defined on the set @xmath36 for @xmath4 even or @xmath37 for @xmath4 odd .",
    "it follows from all these considerations that the bosonic atoms condense in states with well - defined quasimomentum @xmath38 ,    @xmath39    these states form a single - particle basis which diagonalizes the hopping term of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "thus , in this representation , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : bose - hubbard ] ) has the form    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and the krnecker modular delta @xmath42 is equal to one if @xmath35 is an integer multiple of @xmath4 and zero otherwise .",
    "to derive the bogoliubov - de gennes equations we first define the shifted operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 by    @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the condensate wave function with quasimomentum @xmath47 .",
    "next we write the zero temperature grand - canonical hamiltonian @xmath48 , with @xmath49 denoting the number operator , as a normal order expansion with respect to the shifted operators , @xmath43 ,    @xmath50    where the normal ordered operators @xmath51 involve @xmath52 shifted operators .",
    "in the bogoliubov theory the ground state is given by the vacuum of the shifted operators which is a coherent state of the operator @xmath53 .",
    "when we calculate the mean value of @xmath54 in this vacuum state it is clear that the only contribution comes from the term @xmath55 whose minimization with respect to @xmath46 lead us to equation    @xmath56z_{q}=0.\\label{eq : gpe}\\ ] ]    besides if we calculate the mean value of @xmath49 in this ground state , we get @xmath57 .",
    "since this equation plus ( [ eq : gpe ] ) determine @xmath46 except by a phase factor , it can be taken as a real parameter . from these considerations",
    "it follows that @xmath58 and    @xmath59    notice that the expressions ( [ eq : chemical_boson ] ) and ( [ eq : chemical_coherent ] ) , for the chemical potential , coincide in the limit @xmath60 .    in the bogoliubov theory",
    "the main hypothesis is that the majority of atoms remains in the boson condensate state and thus the dynamics of the system in the neighborhood of equilibrium states is described by the quadratic term @xmath61 since the equation ( [ eq : gpe ] ) makes @xmath62 identically zero .",
    "thus , neglecting the third and fourth order terms in ( [ eq : norm_order ] ) , we obtain the effective grand - canonical hamiltonian    @xmath63    where    @xmath64    the diagonalization of the effective hamiltonian determines the energies and the composition of the elementary excitations .",
    "the non - diagonal term in ( [ eq : effective ] ) is the one that creates and annihilates pairs of atoms whose quasimomenta are fixed by the condition @xmath65 which is satisfied if @xmath66 is an integer multiple of @xmath4 ,    @xmath67    as the quasimomenta are restricted to the first brillouin zone , the possible values of @xmath68 are given by    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the signal function which is equal to 1 if @xmath71 and -1 if @xmath72 . in the @xmath73 equation both quasimomenta are in the first brillouin zone whereas when @xmath74 one of the quasimomenta is outside , the effect of @xmath74 is to bring it back to the first brillouin zone .",
    "notice that , except in the case @xmath75 and @xmath4 odd , the pairs of quasimomenta coupled in ( [ eq : effective ] ) are determined by two equations .    from these equations two properties of the coupling structure of quasimomenta emerge .",
    "the first one is the absence of ramifications , that is , one quasimomentum appears only once in the set of pairs satisfying ( [ eq : coupled_pairs ] ) .",
    "the second one is that the sets of pairs of quasimomenta obtained from these two equations are disjoint .",
    "these considerations indicate that when @xmath4 is odd , we have @xmath7 pairs with distinct quasimomenta and only one pair , @xmath76 , with identical . on the other hand , for @xmath4 even , we have @xmath8 pairs with distinct quasimomenta and two pairs with identical , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with @xmath78 if @xmath71 and @xmath79 if @xmath80 . in the tables",
    "[ tab : coupled_even ] and [ tab : coupled_odd ] , we identify the pairs of quasimomenta coupled in ( [ eq : effective ] ) for @xmath4 even and odd , respectively , irrespective if they differ by an exchange of the quasimomenta .     &",

    "in fact , ( [ eq : effective ] ) can be cast into the form    @xmath91 where the first sum involves pairs with identical quasimomenta while the second distinct , with @xmath92 and @xmath93 given explicitly by    @xmath94 and    @xmath95    the diagonalization of quadratic hamiltonians of bosonic operators is a standard problem fully explained in reference @xcite . in the appendix",
    "[ ap : a ] we discuss briefly the procedure of this reference to fix the notation and to present the main properties of the eigenvalue problem . in what follows",
    "we will discuss separately the diagonalization of blocks that involve identical and distinct quasimomenta .",
    "* * identical quasimomenta : @xmath5 blocks *    when @xmath4 is odd there is only one pair with identical quasimomenta , @xmath76 , which is equal to the quasimomentum of the occupied state . solving the corresponding bogoliubov - de gennes equations ( [ eq : eigen_problem ] ) for @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , we find that the eigenmode has zero energy and zero norm .",
    "this result is well known and it is a consequence of the broken continuous symmetry which arises due to violation of the atom number conservation by the bogoliubov theory . in this case @xmath96 can be written as    @xmath98 where the hermitian operator @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 and the inertial parameter @xmath101 is equal to @xmath102 .    on the other hand , when @xmath4 is even , we found two pairs with identical quasimomenta @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with @xmath78 if @xmath71 and @xmath79 if @xmath80 .",
    "the pair with quasimomentum equal to the occupied state , @xmath76 , gives raise to a zero - energy eigenmode as stated before . in the case of the other pair , @xmath77 ,",
    "the bogoliubov - de gennes equations are given by    @xmath103    where we have used @xmath104 , from ( [ eq : single_particle_energy ] ) and ( [ eq : coupled_pairs ] ) .",
    "solving these equations we find the excitation energy    @xmath105    and the eigenvectors associated to the pair @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively , with @xmath109 , where the symbol @xmath110 denotes the transpose of the corresponding matrix .",
    "as will be clear latter on , another useful quantity is the ratio of the components of the eigenvector given by    @xmath111    * * distinct quasimomenta : @xmath6 blocks *    in this case the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for @xmath93 is given by    @xmath112    it is easily seen that equation ( [ eq:4x4 ] ) leaves uncoupled the vectors @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "therefore this equation can be reduced into two @xmath5 eigenvalues equations    @xmath115",
    "@xmath116    solving these equations we find that the excitation energies are given by    @xmath117    @xmath118    where    @xmath119 with @xmath120 given by ( [ eq : single_particle_energy ] ) .",
    "concerning the amplitudes , we found that they satisfy the following relations @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "these properties allow us to identify two excitation eigenmodes whose pairs of opposite energies are @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , @xmath130 , whose components are @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "thus , the diagonalization of @xmath6 blocks gives raise to doublets of excitation energies which are degenerate when @xmath75 and @xmath133 , the last one only for @xmath4 even .",
    "one consequence of the above considerations is that the eigenmodes belonging to a doublet have the same norm , the ratio of the amplitudes given by    @xmath134",
    "according to the bogoliubov theory an equilibrium state is dynamically stable if all the excitation energies are real .",
    "the existence of at least one complex energy is sufficient to guarantee the dynamical instability of the corresponding condensate . in what follows",
    "we investigate the dynamical stability of the condensates .",
    "we will analyze separately the cases where the quasimomenta of the pair are identical and when they are distinct .    * * pair of identical quasimomenta *    as seen in the previous section , for both @xmath4 odd and even , there is a zero - energy eigenmode with quasimomentum equal to the quasimomentum of the occupied state in the condensate .",
    "this is a consequence of the violation of atoms number conservation introduced by the bogoliubov approach .",
    "this mode is always present and leads to an indifferent equilibrium which does not affect the stability of condensates .    for @xmath4",
    "even there is one more pair of identical quasimomenta equal to @xmath135 , where @xmath78 if @xmath71 and @xmath79 if @xmath80 . from ( [ eq : energy_1 ] )",

    "have established the domain of stability of a particular eigenmode @xmath135 . to establish the dynamical stability of the condensate we have to analyze the behavior of all the doublets in the control parameters space .    * * pair of distinct quasimomenta : the doublets *    from ( [ eq : en_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : en_2 ] ) , the excitation energies of the doublets corresponding to the pair @xmath143 are real if one of the two conditions    @xmath144    or @xmath145    is satisfied , where @xmath146 is given explicitly by    @xmath147    with @xmath148 assuming the values shown in table [ tab : parametrization ] .",
    "from ( [ eq : mean_single ] ) it is easily seen that the condition ( [ eq : dy_1 ] ) is satisfied for condensates with quasimomenta defined in the interval @xmath138 .",
    "these condensates whose quasimomentum of the occupied state is in the central region of the first brillouin zone are always dynamically stable , independently of the values of the control parameters . on the other hand",
    "the condition ( [ eq : dy_1_2 ] ) is satisfied for condensates with @xmath140 that obey the inequality    @xmath149    this condition refers to stability of a particular doublet , @xmath150 .",
    "however we are interested in establishing a condition that guarantee that the excitation energies of all doublets are real .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled if we take the minimum of the right hand side of inequality ( [ eq : ineq_dyn ] ) which , according to table [ tab : parametrization ] , is achieved when @xmath151 .",
    "thus , it follows that the condensates whose quasimomentum of the occupied state is in the last quarters of the first brillouin zone , @xmath140 , are dynamically stable if they obey the condition    @xmath152    notice that the stability of the doublets implies the stability of the equal quasimomentum pair since the inequality ( [ eq : dy_single_even ] ) is contained in ( [ eq : cond_dy_stab ] ) .    in the table [",
    "tab : dynamical - stability ] we summarize our findings and a dynamical stability phase diagram is shown in figure [ fig : dynamical - stability - phase ] for @xmath153 sites .",
    "we disregard the condensates with quasimomentum @xmath154 , the reason being that we can not find a bogoliubov transformation that diagonalizes the effective grand - canonical hamiltonian since all eigenvectors of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation have zero norm .",

    "on the other hand the dynamical stability of the condensates with quasimomenta @xmath158 , which are in the last quarters of the first brillouin zone , depends on the control parameters .",

    "actually they are eigenstates of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian when @xmath160 .",
    "when @xmath13 starts to increase the condensates with the smallest @xmath161 in the set @xmath140 start to become unstable until @xmath162 , when all the condensates in the last quarters of the first brillouin zone are unstable .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have shown that the onset of dynamical instability occur when two atoms in the condensate can elastically scatter into a final state where they have quasimomenta different from @xmath163 . to point out the relevance of our analysis to this matter , we cast the stability condition ( [ eq : dy_1 ] ) into the form @xcite @xmath164 this condition reveals that in the condensates whose quasimomentum of the occupied state is in the central region of the first brillouin zone , pairs of atoms can not elastically scatter into two different quasimomentum states @xmath38 and @xmath165 .    for the condensates",

    "however , notice that in the thermodynamical limit all these condensates are dynamically unstable .",
    "in the framework of the bogoliubov theory an equilibrium state is energetically unstable if there is at least one negative excitation energy .",
    "recall that to an elementary excitation we associate a pair of eigenvectors with opposite eigenvalues @xmath169 and opposite sign of the norm , where the value of the excitation energy is the eigenvalue of the eigenvector with a positive norm .",

    "one is  crossing \" that occurs when a positive excitation energy vanishes and changes the sign and the second is  no - crossing \" where we always have a negative excitation energy .",
    "the difference between these two mechanisms is that  crossing \" depends on the control parameters whereas  no - crossing \" does not .",
    "we restrict our analysis of energetic stability to dynamically stable condensates whose excitation energies are all real , a necessary condition of energetic stability .",
    "our procedure to establish the energetic stability of the condensates is , for each eigenmode , to identify the eigenvector with positive norm and the sign of the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "the sign of the norm depends on the size of the ratio @xmath170 . if @xmath171 the norm is positive and if @xmath172 the norm is negative .",

    "follows that    @xmath201 since @xmath202 , @xmath198 is given by    @xmath203    when @xmath13 increases continuously from zero there is a hierarchy in the appearance of these superflow states , starting at @xmath204 where pairs of degenerate condensates with quasimomentum @xmath2 and @xmath205 , beginning with @xmath206 , become metastable up to @xmath194 when all states are metastable .",
    "in this paper we use the bose - hubbard model and the bogoliubov theory to investigate the properties of ultra cold bosonic atoms loaded in a periodic ring with @xmath4 sites .",
    "first we derive and solve the gross - pitaevskii equation of the model and from the analysis of the solutions we show that the atoms condense in states with well - defined quasimomentum whose values are the @xmath4th roots of unit , restricted to the first brillouin zone .",
    "thus , besides the usual zero quasimomentum condensate , we have equilibrium states with non - zero quasimomentum which correspond to current carrying condensates @xcite . these states with well - defined quasimomentum form a basis that diagonalize the hopping term of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "following the bogoliubov theory we derive the effective grand - canonical hamiltonian , quadratic in the shifted operators , whose diagonalization gives the energies and the composition of the elementary excitations .",
    "a detailed analysis of the coupling structure in the effective grand - canonical hamiltonian shows that only pairs of identical and distinct quasimomenta are coupled .",
    "an immediate consequence of this coupling structure is that the effective hamiltonian is block diagonal : @xmath5 blocks when the quasimomenta of the pairs are identical and @xmath6 blocks when they are distinct .",
    "the diagonalization of the @xmath5 blocks shows that the pair @xmath76 with quasimomentum equal to the quasimomentum of the occupied state in the condensate gives raise to the zero - energy eigenmode . on the other , the diagonalization of the @xmath6 blocks gives raise to doublets of excitation energies which are degenerate when @xmath75 and , for @xmath4 even , @xmath133 .",
    "this shows that when @xmath207 the excitation spectrum has a two - branch structure .",
    "we have also found , by inspection of the excitation energies ( [ eq : en_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : en_2 ] ) , that the phonon limit is achieved when the relative quasimomentum @xmath0 goes to zero , with @xmath208 being the quasimomentum of the excitation .",
    "indeed , in this limit it follows that @xmath209 with two different sound velocities : @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "these properties are signatures of the finite size of the quasimomentum of the occupied state in the condensates .",
    "our stability analysis shows that the condensates in the central region of the first brillouin zone , @xmath138 , are always dynamically stable whereas the dynamical stability of the condensates in the last quarters , @xmath140 , depends on the control parameters .",
    "when @xmath13 increases from zero , these condensates start to become unstable beginning with the one of smallest @xmath161 ending up with the instability of all condensates , when @xmath162 .",
    "concerning the energetic stability , we found that the condensates in the last quarters of the first brillouin zone are always unstable whereas the energetic stability of the condensates in the central region depends on the control parameters .",
    "we show that when @xmath199 only the @xmath200 condensate is stable . however , when @xmath212 , pairs of degenerate condensates with non - zero quasimomentum , @xmath2 and @xmath205 , start to become energetically stable ending up with all the condensates in the central region of the first brillouin zone being energetically stable , when @xmath213 .",
    "as discussed in the paper , metastable current carrying condensates are candidates to present superfluid motion .",
    "a metastable state is both dynamically and energetically stable , consequently a local minimum of the energy .",
    "our analysis shows that the bogoliubov theory predicts that there is an interval in the control parameters space where metastable current carrying condensates exist . the number of these states increases with @xmath13 and they are restricted to the central region of the first brillouin zone .",
    "etdm and ejvp would like to acknowledge financial support from fapesp and cnpq .",
    "a general quadratic hamiltonian of bosonic operators is given by    @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 are creation and annihilation bosonic operators , @xmath217 and @xmath218 are elements of an hermitian and symmetric matrices , respectively .",
    "the diagonalization of this quadratic hamiltonian consists in finding a canonical transformation to quasiparticle operators ,    @xmath219 such that @xmath220 , when written in terms of this operators , takes the form of a system of non - interacting quasiparticles . from this constraint",
    "it follows that    @xmath221    which is the matrix form of bogoliubov - de gennes equations that determines the excitation energies @xmath222 and the composition of the elementary excitations @xmath223 , with @xmath110 denoting the transpose of the corresponding matrix . when the eigenvalues @xmath222 are real , they appear in pairs @xmath224 with opposite sign of the norm , @xmath225 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath226 is an eigenvector with the eigenvalue @xmath222 then @xmath227 , with    @xmath228 is an eigenvector with the opposite eigenvalue , @xmath229 , and opposite sign of the norm .",
    "the excitation energy is identified with the eigenvalue whose eigenvector has a positive norm .",
    "as seen before the pairs of distinct quasimomenta , @xmath143 , coupled in the effective grand - canonical hamiltonian identify the doublets that compose the excitation spectrum of the condensates .",
    "however @xmath35 and @xmath230 are not independent since they are related by equation ( [ eq : coupled_pairs ] )",
    ". therefore we need one parameter to identify the doublets .",
    "our choice was the relative quasimomentum , @xmath231 , which leads to an ordered and one - to - one parametrization of the doublets .",
    "this can be easily seen noticing that we can cast the equation ( [ eq : coupled_pairs ] ) into the form"
