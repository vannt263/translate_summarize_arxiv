    "the term loch ness monster is well known around the world , specially in the great glen in the scottish highlands , a rift valley which contains three important lochs for the region , called lochy , oich and ness .",
    "the last one , people believe that a monster lives and lurks , baptized with the name of the loch .",
    "the existence of the monster is not farfetched , people say , taking into account that the loch ness is deeper than the north sea and is very long , very narrow and has never been known to freeze ( see figure [ real - mons ] ) .",
    "the earliest report of such a monster appeared in the fifth century , and from that time different versions about the monster passed from generation to generation @xcite .",
    "a kind of modern interest in the monster was sparked by 1933 when george spicer and his wife saw the monster crossing the road in front of their car .",
    "after that sighting , hundreds of different reports about the monster have been collected , including photos , portrayals and other descriptions . in spite of this evidence , without a body , a fossil or the monster in person , the loch ness monster is only part of the folklore .    in a different context , in mathematics , the term _ loch ness monster _ is well known , and not in the folklore . in number",
    "theory there is a family of functions called exponential sums , which in general take the form @xmath0 and for the special case in which @xmath1 the graph of the curve associated to that function is called _ loch ness monster _ , dubbed to the curve by j. h. loxton @xcite , @xcite .        from view of the kerkjrt s theorem of classification of noncompact surfaces ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite ) , the _ infinite loch ness monster _ is the name of the orientable surface which has infinite genus and only one end @xcite .",
    "simply ,  .",
    "ghys ( see @xcite ) describes it as the orientable surface obtained from the euclidean plane which is attached to an infinity of handles ( see figure [ figure3 ] ) . or alternatively , from a geometric viewpoint one can think that the infinite loch ness monster is the only orientable surface having infinitely many handles and only one way to go to infinity .      in the seventies , the interest by several authors ( _ e.g. _",
    ", @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) on the qualitative study in the noncompact leaves in foliations of closed manifolds had grown .",
    "ongoing in this line of research considering closed 3-manifolds foliated by surfaces , a. phillips and d. sullivan proved that the quasi - isometry types of the surfaces well known as the _ _ jacob s ladder _ _ ,",
    "the _ infinite jail cell windows _ @xcite , and the _ infinite jangle gym _ ( see figure [ figure4 ] ) can not occur in foliations of @xmath2 , or in fact in orientable foliation of any manifold with second betti number zero .",
    "nevertheless , all these surfaces are diffeomorphic to the _ infinite loch ness monster _",
    "( see @xcite )",
    ". roughly speaking from the historical point of view , this nomenclature to this topological surface appeared published on _ leaves with isolated ends in foliated 3-manifolds _ ( @xcite ) , however the authors wedge the term _ infinite loch ness monster _ to preliminary manuscript of @xcite , which was published the following year . under these",
    "evident , one can consider to a. phillips and d. sullivan as the _ infinite loch ness monster _",
    "s parents .",
    "note that to build a loch ness monster from the euclidian plane using the gluing straight segments is necessary to draw on it a countable family of straight segment and suitable glue them .",
    "it means , we consider @xmath3 a copy of the euclidean plane equipped with a fixed origin @xmath4 and an orthogonal basis @xmath5 .",
    "on @xmath3 we draw the countable family of straight segments following : @xmath6      now , we cut @xmath3 along @xmath7 , for each @xmath8 , which turns @xmath3 into a surface with boundary consisting of infinite straight segments . then , we glue the straight segments @xmath9 and @xmath10 as above ( see figure [ figure3 ] ) . hence , the surface @xmath11 comes from the euclidean plane attached to an infinitely many handles , which appear gluing the countable disjoint straight segments belonged to the family @xmath12 . in other words ,",
    "the mathematical object @xmath11 is the infinite loch ness monster .    from view of differential geometric , the surface @xmath11",
    "is conformed by two kind of points .",
    "the set of _ flat points _ conformed by all points in @xmath11 except the ends of the straight segments @xmath13 , for every @xmath8 .",
    "to each one of this elements there exist an open isometric to some neighborhood of the euclidean plane . since the curvature is invariant under isometries then the curvature in the flat points is equal to zero .",
    "the other ones , are called _ singular points _ , in this case they are the end points of the straight segments @xmath13 , for each @xmath14 .",
    "their respective neighborhood is isometric to cyclic branched covering @xmath15 of the disk in the the euclidean plane , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are _ cone angle singularity of angle _ @xmath16 ( see figure [ cone ] ) .",
    "the surfaces having this kind of structure are known as _ tame translation surfaces _ ( see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "an application of the uniformization theorem ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite ) ensures the existence of a subgroup @xmath17 of the isometries group of the hyperbolic plane @xmath18 acting on the hyperbolic plane @xmath19 performing the quotient space @xmath20 in a hyperbolic surface homeomorphic to the infinite loch ness monster .",
    "in other words , there exist a hyperbolic polygon @xmath21 , which is suitable identifying its sides by hyperbolic isometries to get the infinite loch ness monster . an easy way to define",
    "the polygon @xmath22 is as follows .",
    "first , we consider the countable family conformed by the disjoint half - circles @xmath23 having @xmath24 center in @xmath25 and radius equal to one , for every @xmath26",
    ". see figure [ circles ] .",
    "in other words , @xmath27      removing the half - circle @xmath24 of the hyperbolic plane @xmath19 we get two connected component , which are called the _ inside _ of @xmath24 and the _ outside _ of @xmath24 , respectively ( see figure[inside ] ) .",
    "they are denoted as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the boundary of @xmath22 is conformed by the half - circle belonged to the family @xmath32 .",
    "then for every @xmath33 the hyperbolic geodesics @xmath34 and @xmath35 are identified as it is shown in figure [ identificacion ] by some of the following mbius transformations :          through the mbius transformations above , the inside of the half - circle @xmath34 ( the half - circle @xmath37 , respectively ) is send by the map @xmath40 ( the map @xmath41 , respectively ) into the outside of the half - circle @xmath35 ( the half - circle @xmath38 , respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , the outside of the half - circle @xmath34 ( the half - circle @xmath37 , respectively ) is send by @xmath42 ( the map @xmath41 , respectively ) into the inside of the half - circle @xmath35 ( the half - circle @xmath38 , respectively ) .",
    "hence , the hyperbolic surface @xmath11 get glued the side of the polygon @xmath22 is the infinite loch ness monster . from the polygon",
    "@xmath22 we deduce that noncompact quotient space @xmath11 comes whit a hyperbolic structure having infinite area .",
    "fortunately , the identification defined above takes the pairwise disjoint straight segment in the boundary of @xmath22 performing into the only one end of the surface @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , for each integer number @xmath43 we consider the subregion @xmath44 , which is gotten by the intersection of @xmath22 and the strip @xmath45 ( see figure [ subregion ] ) , then restricting to @xmath46 the identification defined above it is turned into a torus with one hole @xmath47 ( see figure [ subsurface ] ) , which is a subsurface of @xmath11 . given the elements of the countable family @xmath48 are pair disjoint subsurfaces of @xmath11 then it performs infinite genus in the hyperbolic surface @xmath11 . in other words , @xmath11 is the infinite loch ness monster .      from the analytic point of view",
    ", we have built a fuchsian subgroup @xmath17 of @xmath49 , where @xmath17 is infinitely generated by the set of mbius transformations @xmath50 ( see equations [ eq:5 ] and [ eq:6 ] ) , having the subset @xmath21 as fundamental domain .",
    "then @xmath17 acts on the hyperbolic plane @xmath19 . defining the subset",
    "@xmath51 as follows , @xmath52 the fuchsian group @xmath17 acts freely and properly discontinuously on the open subset @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the quotient space @xmath54 is a well - defined hyperbolic surface homeomorphic to the infinite loch ness monster .",
    "moreover , it follows from an application of the uniformization theorem that the fundamental group @xmath55 of the infinite loch ness monster is isomorphic to @xmath17 ."
