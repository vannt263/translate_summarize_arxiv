    "the coma cluster of galaxies ( a1656 ) is a rich , spherically symmetric , and centrally concentrated galaxy cluster , and with a mean recession velocity of @xmath9 km / s ( colless & dunn 1996 ) , it is the nearest of the very rich ( class 2 or more ) abell clusters . in terms of luminosity ,",
    "the cluster core is dominated by two supergiants , the elliptical ngc 4889 and the cd ngc 4874 . as in all rich clusters , the dwarf elliptical ( de ) and nucleated dwarf elliptical ( de , n ) galaxies are by far the most numerous galaxies in the dense environment of the cluster core ( dressler 1980 ; ferguson & sandage 1991 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; secker & harris 1996 ) , though their contribution to the total cluster _ mass _ is not significant ( bernstein et al .",
    "it is these des which are the target of the study we present here . with @xmath10(coma ) = 7200 km / s , 1 arcmin @xmath11 kpc . for the purposes of this discussion ,",
    "we adopt a distance scale of @xmath12 km / s / mpc , which yields a distance modulus @xmath13 .",
    "deep optical ccd images of rich galaxy clusters present a formidable challenge to photometric measurement techniques .",
    "the thousands of detectable objects on such images span a huge parameter space in their measured properties : image _ morphology _ must be divided into starlike versus nonstellar objects , with the latter subdivided into morphological classes for each of the giant cluster galaxies , dwarf galaxies , and background galaxies .",
    "the range in _ luminosity _ of the cluster galaxies is typically at least 10 magnitudes , and their _ surface brightness",
    "_ ranges from those of dense nuclei or globular clusters down to the extreme low surface brightnesses of the faintest dwarfs , often less than 1% of the night sky .",
    "lastly , typical _ apparent diameters _ range over almost two orders of magnitude , for example ( in our coma images ) from two to three pixels for unresolved ( starlike ) objects , to @xmath14 pixels for des , to 60 - 100 pixels for the largest cluster members .",
    "in addition , a rich cluster field generates spatial differences in ccd noise levels , spatial resolution , field crowding , and global light gradients .",
    "the data analysis problem in its entirety is sufficiently challenging that any single technique will be strained to measure all types of objects correctly .    here",
    "we present a newly constructed code which is necessarily restricted to one aspect of this overall problem , specifically _ a semi - automated approach to the detection , photometry and classification of faint objects _ on ccd images . specifically , we describe techniques we have assembled to measure accurate total magnitudes , integrated colors , and several intensity - weighted quantities to discriminate among different image morphologies .",
    "when these techniques are used in conjunction with other pre - existing tools ( e.g. , profile - fitting photometry for crowded fields , isophote - fitting tools for modeling large - diameter giant cluster galaxies , and median - filtering techniques to remove the slowly varying light gradients ) , we have a sophisticated set of computer codes , sufficient for a thorough analysis of ccd images of rich galaxy clusters .    in the following sections we describe the calculation of total magnitudes , colors and intensity - weighted moments for faint objects on large - format ccd images .",
    "we have implemented these in a robust software code which we call dynamo ; it has been rigorously tested and characterized on artificial and real ccd data sets .",
    "the dynamo source code is well documented and it is available electronically from the first author .",
    "this is paper i of two papers concerning de galaxies in the coma cluster ( paper ii is secker , harris & plummer 1997 ) . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and image preprocessing for our coma cluster images . in section 3",
    "we discuss the estimation of accurate mean sky values and object detection . in section 4",
    "we discuss the computation of unbiased intensity - weighted quantities , together with their use in image analysis and classification . in section 5",
    "we describe the calculation of total magnitudes , integrated colors and surface brightnesses , and show preliminary results for the coma cluster de sample .",
    "on the nights april 9 and 10 , 1991 , we used a te @xmath15 ccd at the prime focus of the kpno 4-m telescope to mosaic - image the coma cluster core .",
    "exposure series in both the @xmath5- and @xmath16-bands were obtained for three overlapping core fields as well as a control field placed well outside the cluster , as listed in [ tab1paper1 ] . provided in table",
    "[ tab1paper1 ] are the field centers as specified in the image headers , and in table [ tab2paper1 ] we provide a summary of parameters relevant to these images . in addition to the program and control fields , throughout both nights",
    "numerous images of standard star fields were obtained ( table [ tab3paper1 ] ) , which were used for calibration .",
    "gray - scale images of the three program fields are shown in figure [ comafields ] .",
    "the ngc 4874 field is roughly centered on the cd galaxy ngc 4874 , and it overlaps ( by about 400 pixels ) with the ngc 4889 field to the east and the ngc 4874 south field to the south .",
    "the ngc 4889 field includes the supergiant galaxy ngc 4889 , and extends outwards to the east .",
    "the ngc 4874 south field is located below ngc 4874 , with the southernmost edge extending @xmath17 arcmin , or @xmath18 kpc , from ngc 4874 .",
    "the control field is located a full 2.09 degrees , or @xmath19 mpc , almost directly east of the cluster center at ngc 4874 .",
    "the te2k ccd had 27 micron pixels , an image scale of @xmath20/px , a gain of 21.4 @xmath21/adu and a readnoise of 13 @xmath22/px . during the two ( photometric ) nights of observation ,",
    "the seeing stayed consistently in the range of 1.1 to 1.3 arcsec .",
    "this particular ccd was an early - generation large - format detector and suffered from rather poor cosmetics , dominated by the completely unusable columns 1701 through 2044 .",
    "when trimmed , the field of view was about 15@xmath23@xmath2418@xmath23 . with this and the overlapping regions taken into account , we observed a total area of @xmath25 arcmin@xmath3 , a significant fraction of the coma cluster core .",
    "the trimmed control field has an area of 270 arcmin@xmath3 . while our original intention was to image two additional fields south of ngc 4874 and another control field , midway through the second night the ccd detector suffered electronic failure , terminating the data acquisition .",
    "image preprocessing was carried out within iraf , with the usual routines _",
    "noao.imred.ccdred.ccdproc _ and _ images.imcombine_. the raw images were first overscan corrected , trimmed and bias subtracted .",
    "flat fields were constructed from a combination of dome flats , twilight flats , and dark - sky flats ( from the sparsely - populated control field ) .",
    "the individual exposures were averaged together to yield _ eight master images _ ; @xmath5- and @xmath16-band master images for each of the three program fields and the control field . as specified in table [ tab2paper1 ] ,",
    "two of the @xmath16-band master images represent a median of the three exposures , while the other two @xmath16-band master images represent a a straight average of the two available images .",
    "the @xmath5-band master images are all weighted averages of three individual 900-sec exposures , where the weighting factors are given by    @xmath26    here , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the mean sky level in the vicinity of the star , the star s fwhm and a measure of its sky - subtracted central intensity . thus higher weights are assigned to those exposures with lower sky values and sharper seeing profiles . while the s / n ratio of the @xmath16-band images is lower than for the corresponding @xmath5-band images at equivalent magnitudes we used @xmath16 only for color index measurement and not for object detection .",
    "the @xmath16-band master images of each field were aligned with the @xmath5-band master images , with the flux - conserving iraf routines _",
    "images.geomap _ and _ images.geotran_. at the same time , the transformations between program fields were derived to map both the ngc 4889 field and the ngc 4874 south field to the coordinates of the ngc 4874 field . in this system , the centers of ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 are located at approximately ( 1061,1010 ) and ( 1875,1124 ) , and the bright ( saturated ) star above ngc 4874 is located near ( 1000,1735 ) .    in order for our measured aperture colors to be accurate , we must ensure that the sky - subtracted intensities summed within the individual apertures are independent of differences in seeing between the @xmath16- and @xmath5-band master images . since the @xmath16 images had slightly better seeing quality than the @xmath5 images , we convolved the @xmath5 master frames with a gaussian filter of width @xmath30 .",
    "numerical values for @xmath31 are given in table [ tab2paper1 ] .",
    "the end result is that for all four fields , the seeing ( fwhm ) of the @xmath5-band master images agrees with the @xmath16-band images to an accuracy of about @xmath32fwhm@xmath330.01 pixels . at this level of accuracy , we can be sure that our color estimates are consistent and independent of seeing effects .",
    "all eight of the master images were then filtered wth the fast ring median filter of secker ( 1995 ) to remove all small - scale structure ; the ring - filtered versions of the master images were then subtracted from the originals , and the appropriate sky levels added back in , yielding a final image with all large - scale light gradients removed to facilitate faint - object detection and photometry .",
    "the characteristic radius @xmath34 of the ring filter should be chosen as small as possible for the population of interest : we used 16 weighted pixels ( see secker 1995 ) in an annulus of characteristic radius @xmath35 pixels ( @xmath36 kpc at coma ) .",
    "visual inspection shows that this radius is appropriate for all but the @xmath37 brightest galaxies ( giants plus bright dwarfs ) on each of the program fields .",
    "these brightest galaxies were measured on the original ( unfiltered ) master images to ensure that their true luminosity was not underestimated .",
    "( because of the light gradients present on the unfiltered images , the consequent uncertaintes in their total magnitudes are larger . )",
    "to facilitate the testing and characterization of our photometry and classification techniques , we used iraf s artificial image / object generation packages ( _ noao.artdata.gallist , .starlist , .mkobject _ ) to generate artificial ccd images closely resembling the features of the real data ( intensity profiles , sky - pixel scatter , range in apparent magnitude and object diameter ) .",
    "the artificial ccd images are , however , cosmetically perfect , uncrowded , and have no overall light gradients .",
    "the results of these simulations are described at the appropriate positions throughout this text . in general",
    ", we find that our intensity - weighted moment and total magnitude estimates are systematically quite accurate .",
    "two @xmath38 simulated images were generated , each with an equivalent gain of 64.2 @xmath21/adu , a read noise of 7.51 @xmath21/px and a mean background level of 1500.0 adu , together with the corresponding poisson noise .",
    "to each image one distinct population of object ( either stars or galaxies ) was added .",
    "while any selection of galaxies and stars which span a reasonable magnitude will enable us to test our code , the input luminosity functions of the stars and galaxies were matched to those observed for the coma cluster .",
    "these luminosity functions are defined over @xmath39 mag .",
    "this range includes the brightest de galaxies , and extends fainter than our @xmath40 limiting magnitude ( see below and paper ii ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of all objects was determined by random sampling from a uniform distribution ; in this manner , crowding effects are minimized .    the first image consisted of 500 gaussian - profile stars , with a fwhm = 3 px , corresponding to gaussian standard deviation of @xmath41 pixels .",
    "the input luminosity function followed a power law @xmath42 .",
    "the second image consisted of 500 exponential - profile galaxies convolved with the seeing profile , with minor to major axis ratios of @xmath43 .",
    "our choice of an exponential profile is consistent with current observations for the majority of de galaxies ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "the input luminosity function followed a schechter function with a characteristic magnitude of @xmath44 mag and a power - law exponent of @xmath45 .",
    "for all but the most crowded fields , the set of pixels in a ccd image is dominated by those which do not contain flux from resolved objects such as stars or galaxies . in most broadband images",
    "these _ sky pixels _ have a mean value , and a scatter about this mean , governed primarily by poisson statistics . for typical images of galaxies in the field or in cluster environments ,",
    "the images are only sparsely covered by objects , such that the number of _ object pixels _ is @xmath46 percent .",
    "thus , the probability distribution function of pixel intensity values is generally dominated by a gaussian distribution for the sky pixels , skewed by a bright - side tail extending to high intensity values ( figure [ pixelhist ] ) . while the contamination by number is small , the contamination arising from the large intensity values of these object pixels is extreme , and therefore the estimates of a mean sky value are not trivial . in our approach to faint galaxy photometry , there are two separate instances in which we depend upon accurate and consistent estimates of the average sky intensity : a _ global _ estimate to set an object detection threshold for the entire ccd image , and _ local _ estimates from annuli about each object . for both the global and the local estimates ,",
    "the sample of pixels will be contaminated by object pixels .",
    "thus , we implement an iterative method to estimate the _ mode _ and _ standard deviation _ for a vector of pixel intensity values , using chauvenet s criterion ( parratt 1961 ) to trim obviously discrepant ( non - sky ) pixel intensities .",
    "this routine is based on techniques developed for daophot ii ( stetson et al .",
    "1990 ; stetson 1994 ) , and it consistently matches the results of stetson s code ( to within a scatter of @xmath47 adu ) when applied to similar data vectors .      for any given ccd image , the faint and low - surface - brightness objects are most difficult to detect .",
    "one technique to increase the detection efficiency for faint _",
    "stellar _ objects is to pass a convolution kernel over the ccd images prior to utilizing a detection algorithm ( e.g. stetson 1994 ) .",
    "this technique works well for stars , which have a well defined and nearly uniform radial intensity profile across the field , but not for galaxies , each of which has a distinct intensity profile .",
    "we therefore adopt a different algorithm for object detection . provided the primary ccd image is globally flat , we assume simply that each local intensity maximum exceeding some constant intensity threshold is associated with the center of a unique object . in our analysis of the coma ccd images",
    "we perform object detection on the ( deeper ) @xmath5-band master images , which we refer to as _ primary _ images .",
    "the @xmath16-band images are referred to as _ secondary _ images , used only to construct @xmath48 color indices for the primary sample of objects .    to set the global sky level on the median - filtered master images , we initially select @xmath49 unique and random pixels covering the full area of the image .",
    "the subset of these pixel values which are within the valid intensity range form a data vector from which the global mode @xmath50 and standard deviation @xmath51 are iteratively estimated .",
    "we then define the detection threshold ( figure [ pixelhist ] ) as an intensity level , some multiple @xmath52 of @xmath51 above @xmath50 . for an object to be detected",
    "it must have at least one pixel which exceeds this threshold .",
    "the user - specified dimensionless parameter @xmath52 is typically in the range 3.5 - 5.0 , with the lower limit set to avoid detecting bright peaks in the poisson noise distribution .",
    "pixel values falling below the detection threshold can not ( by our definition ) be designated as object centers .",
    "all pixels on the @xmath5-band master images satisfying @xmath53 are potential _ object _ pixels , and these are grouped for further analysis . these object pixels compose a data vector which is sorted by intensity into descending order , and then divided into two groups : ( 1 ) pixels defining the peak - flux intensity for potential object centers , and ( 2 ) those pixels which are _ connected neighbors _ of a potential object center ( i.e. they are immediately adjacent to an existing object ) .",
    "we do this separation by defining the location of the first ( brightest ) pixel as the peak - flux position of the first object . for the remaining objects , we take advantage of the fact that for individual objects , the pixel intensity values decrease rather smoothly",
    "as the radial distance from the center increases ( at least until the poisson noise in the object s wings begins to dominate the signal ) . thus stepping through the ensemble of all object pixels",
    ", each subsequent pixel will form an element of the first object at increasing radii , or will be the peak - flux pixel of a new object .",
    "we defined a logical function called _ neighbor _ , which we use to divide the pixels into their two groups ; it returns _ false _ if the @xmath54 pixel is isolated ( i.e. , separated from an existing peak - flux object center by lower - intensity pixel values ; i.e. , group 1 ) , and returns _ true _ if this @xmath54 pixel is separated from a peak - flux object center by less than the seeing disk radius , or if the pixel is attached to a brighter pixel of the same object , forming part of the decreasing continuum of pixels belonging to that object ( i.e. , group 2 ) . by applying the _ neighbor _ function to the sorted vector of pixels",
    "brighter than the detection threshold , we obtain our list of center positions ( integer peak - flux pixel coordinates @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) for individual objects .    for our coma data",
    ", we adopted a detection threshold of @xmath57 , which corresponds to @xmath58 percent of the mean sky level .",
    "although objects with a central surface brightness lower than this level are _ measurable _ , attempts to _ detect _ these faintest objects objectively also yield many spurious detections from pure noise .",
    "our method ( like most others ) is therefore strongly biased against extremely low surface brightness objects .",
    "we do not regard this as a serious problem in our case , as these extreme - lsb objects will mostly be fainter than the adopted limiting magnitude @xmath59 mag ( paper ii ) .    on each master",
    "@xmath5-band image , we detected on the order of @xmath60 objects to this central surface brightness threshold .",
    "of these objects , at least 50 percent are fainter than @xmath59 and were discarded .",
    "in addition , we visually inspected _ every _ detected object , and deleted obvious `` false '' detections , corresponding to ccd defects , charge overflow columns and diffraction spikes around bright stars .",
    "the estimate of an object s magnitude is essentially an exercise in counting .",
    "we count the total number of photons received within the area of an object , and subtract from this the number of photons which would have been counted even if the object were not there ( i.e. , the _ local _ mean sky level ) .",
    "but this is not a trivial task , and for faint objects uncertainty in the local sky level is the limiting factor in our ability to compute accurate and unbiased photometry ( cf .",
    "section 5.5 ) . to compute accurate values for object total magnitudes , one must first estimate a mean sky value ( in adu ) at the exact location of the object in question ( starlike or non - stellar ) .",
    "however , since the object and sky share the same set of pixels , the determinations of the total magnitude and local sky value are coupled .",
    "we choose to compute accurate local sky values by iteratively estimating the intensity mode in an annulus about each object .",
    "the inner radius of the annulus is chosen large enough to minimize contamination from the object , yet small enough that the estimate is representative of the local sky .",
    "the outer radius is set to ensure a that a statistically large number of pixels are included in the estimate . @xmath61 ( pixels ) denotes the inner radius of this sky annulus , and @xmath62 ( pixels ) denotes the width of the sky annulus .",
    "while @xmath61 and @xmath62 would remain constant for stars ( all of which have the same profile on a given image ) , they will differ among non - stellar objects .",
    "thus for accurate photometry of faint galaxies , @xmath61 and @xmath62 must be chosen with care to reflect the projected dimensions of the galaxies of interest .    for each detected object , the radial distance of the @xmath54 pixel from the peak - flux pixel",
    "is represented by @xmath63 , and a data vector of intensity values is constructed from all pixels which satisfy the criteria @xmath64 .",
    "the resulting data vector is used to compute the local sky mode @xmath65 and the local standard deviation @xmath66 .",
    "these estimates are made for every detected object , and they are used to derive the object s magnitude and color , as described in section 5 .",
    "we separated the detected objects into three sets , dependent upon their apparent diameters .",
    "these groups are ( i ) the brightest and most extended giant galaxies , ( ii ) other giants and the brightest des , and ( iii ) the numerous faint and small - scale galaxies .",
    "photometry for objects in the latter group is measured on the filtered - subtracted master images , with a sky annulus of inner radius 24 pixels and a width of 4 pixels .",
    "objects in first two groups are measured on the original master images with the sky annuli chosen appropriately : an inner radius of 95 pixels for group ( i ) and 45 pixels for group ( ii ) , and a width of 4 pixels in both cases .",
    "in this paper , the measurement and classification of faint objects on ccd images is based on the computation of accurate intensity - weighted moments . for low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) data",
    ", these calculations depend strongly on the estimated sky value in the vicinity of individual objects , and the radial distance over which the moment summations are carried . for the radial moments discussed below",
    ", there is an inherent difficulty : in order to carry the intensity - weighted summations to a sufficiently large radius , one needs to know the true extent of an object .",
    "however , it is the radial moments themselves which define the object s size .",
    "if the summations are prematurely truncated , the resultant moments will be underestimated .",
    "if these sums are carried too far in radius , the resultant moments can be rendered meaningless , since the sky noise will dominate the intensity contribution to the sums .",
    "we therefore implement a curve - of - growth technique to estimate the limiting radius @xmath67 for the calculation of the intensity - weighted radial moments .",
    "we define @xmath67 to be the radius at which the object s flux drops below one percent of the local sky value .",
    "thus @xmath67 defines the radius of a circular aperture interior to which the computation of the radial moments is carried out .",
    "this radius is sufficiently large to enclose the object , yet it it is not strongly affected by contributions from sky pixels to the intensity - weighted summation .",
    "as will be seen below , @xmath67 is used only in the calculation of the image moments and directly for any magnitude calculations .",
    "the limiting radius @xmath67 is computed separately for each object as follows .",
    "concentric circular annuli are placed around the peak - flux pixel ( i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , and the _ mean _ pixel intensity values within these annuli are computed . denoting the interior and exterior edges of each annulus by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the smallest annulus has @xmath70 pixels , each annulus has a constant width of two pixels , @xmath71 , and with each concentric annulus @xmath72 is incremented by 0.5 pixels . for each annulus , the mean pixel intensity @xmath73@xmath74@xmath75 is computed for the set of pixels satisfying    @xmath76 < r_{\\rm out}^2 ; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ i=1, ...",
    ",n.\\ ] ]    for stars and early - type galaxies , this mean intensity will typically decrease with radius outwards , approaching the local sky level . if the local sky mode @xmath65 is the true sky level near the object in question , @xmath67 is defined as the radius at which the mean pixel intensity first satisfies @xmath73@xmath74@xmath75@xmath77 , where @xmath67 is the geometric mean of @xmath72 and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) or the radius of the seeing disk , whichever is greater . in this manner",
    "@xmath67 represents the radius at which the object s signal merges ( at the one percent level ) with the local sky level .",
    "thus @xmath67 will enclose a similar fraction of the total flux for all exponential - profile galaxies .",
    "while this fraction will differ for stars and de vaucouleurs-@xmath80 profile galaxies , @xmath67 itself is not used directly for photometry ( section 5.1 ) .",
    "the summations involved in the calculation of intensity - weighted radial moments ( section 4.3 ) include pixels interior to @xmath67 ; thus , if @xmath67 is systematically underestimated , the intensity - weighted moments will also be .",
    "the results presented in section 4.3 show that this is not the case .",
    "however , when calculating @xmath67 a source of error arises from nearby objects , which can cause an overestimate for @xmath67 . we have implemented a facility to enable rapid verification of each object on an individual basis : simple , low - resolution intensity plots are generated , centered on each object , with the calculated @xmath81 radius clearly displayed . for objects affected by nearby neighbors , @xmath67 can be modified interactively , with the radial moments recalculated interior to this new value , minimizing the effect of nearby objects .",
    "the object detection routine described in section 3.1 provides object centers in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which represent the ( integer ) position of the peak - flux pixel . however , intensity - weighted averages in the vicinity of the peak - flux pixel yield center positions accurate at the fractional pixel level .",
    "the center positions corresponding to the intensity - weighted averages are denoted @xmath73@xmath82@xmath75 and @xmath73@xmath83@xmath75 , and are given by    @xmath84    above , @xmath82 and @xmath83 represent image pixels , and @xmath85 represents the sky - subtracted pixel intensities , given by @xmath86 .",
    "the summations in ( [ eq : centers ] ) are computed for all pixels interior to an aperture of radius equal to two pixels . adopting this small ( and constant ) radius yields sufficient pixels to obtain accurate weighted moments , yet it is small enough to constrain the center estimate to be nearby the peak - flux pixel center .",
    "the center positions calculated for objects on the artificial ccd images compare well with the input values .",
    "the estimates are unbiased , and the scatter is on the order of @xmath870.2 pixels for bright stars and galaxies , increasing to @xmath870.4 pixels for the faintest objects .      the intensity - weighted radial moments @xmath88 and @xmath89 were defined in their integral form by kron ( 1980 ) , and in a discrete form by harris et al .",
    "the first moment , @xmath88 , and the second negative moment , @xmath89 , of the radial intensity distribution , are given by    @xmath90    these two radial moments have units of pixels , and are constrained to lie in the range @xmath91 . above , @xmath92 represents the distance ( in pixels ) of the @xmath54 pixel from the object s peak - flux pixel center , @xmath85 is the sky - subtracted intensity value , and the summations are taken over the ensemble of pixels which satisfy @xmath93 . in ( [ eq : r1 ] ) , the arbitrary additive constant of 0.5 is included to avoid singularities , while the 1/2 exponent is included to return the dimensions of length .",
    "these two radial moments in principle provide different and complementary descriptions of the radial intensity distribution for individual objects , since the @xmath88 moment is an indicator of the image wing spread and thus of physical dimension ( see below ) , whereas the @xmath89 moment quantifies the degree of central concentration of an object .",
    "for both moments , starlike objects have a similar low value constant for all magnitudes ( i.e. , the stellar sequence ) , and non - stellar ( galaxy ) images scatter ( to larger values ) away from the stellar sequence .",
    "since the @xmath89 moment gives highest weight to the brightest central pixels , it is stable and robust , and in general less affected by crowding than the @xmath88 moment . in practice , these two moments are also well correlated for nonstellar objects ( harris et al .",
    "analysis of our artificial galaxy field ccd image shows that the resolved galaxies are reasonably described by @xmath94 , with both moments measured in pixels .",
    "these two radial moments have been calculated for all objects on both of the artificial ccd images , and when plotted against total magnitude ( figure [ rdlmntsim ] ) , the difference between stellar and nonstellar objects is immediately obvious .",
    "the radial moments for the stellar objects are @xmath95 and @xmath96 pixels over the entire magnitude range and provide a valuable consistency test that the limiting radius @xmath67 encloses almost all the luminosity . for bright stars , the majority of the luminosity is clearly measured , and the first radial moment is constant at its theoretically - predicted value of @xmath97 . for faint stars , the @xmath88 and @xmath89 moments scatter about this true value , yet",
    "the average value remains remarkably constant .",
    "while we do not calculate formal uncertainties for these radial moments , their scatter about the stellar sequence provides a reasonable estimate of their uncertainty as a function of magnitude .",
    "parameter space plots of @xmath89 versus magnitude have been effective in culling nonstellar objects from samples of starlike objects ( e.g. , harris et al .",
    "1991 ; butterworth & harris 1992 ; fleming et al .",
    "1995 ; see also mclaughlin et al .",
    "1995 for a variant of this approach ) , and it is this technique which we adopt here for our star / galaxy discrimination .",
    "the scattering of non - stellar objects away from the constant stellar sequence is evident in figure [ rdlmntsim ] . also evident",
    "is the magnitude ( in this case , near @xmath98 mag ) at which the nonstellar sequence merges with the starlike sequence .",
    "this is a direct result of the small linear size of the faintest galaxies coupled with the ccd image scale and seeing .    in figure [ fourrdlmmnts ] , we plot the intensity - weighted radial moment @xmath89 versus the apparent @xmath99 magnitude , for objects detected on the four @xmath5-band ccd images described in section 2.1 .",
    "numerous nonstellar objects are present at all magnitudes ; near @xmath100 mag , these begin to merge with the stellar sequence , and below @xmath101 mag , as the nonstellar objects become faint and starlike , the @xmath89 moment loses its ability to discriminate , and all objects appear starlike .",
    "evident on all four plots in figure [ fourrdlmmnts ] are two additional trends .",
    "first , the bright end of the stellar sequence rises slightly above the typical mean value , most probably caused by a change in image structure due to the behavior of the ccd near saturation .",
    "second , a population of objects appears which are faint and pointlike ; i.e. , their calculated @xmath89 moment is less than for a stellar profile .",
    "these arise from cosmic rays , hot pixels or ccd defects .",
    "while there are nonstellar objects evident in all four of the ccd fields , as expected , the control field has considerably fewer nonstellar objects .",
    "the dotted lines in figure [ fourrdlmmnts ] are used to restrict the data sample .",
    "the vertical line at @xmath102 mag corresponds to our magnitude limit , and all objects fainter than this are discarded .",
    "the upper horizontal line excludes objects in and below the bright stellar sequence , with @xmath103 and @xmath104 mag .",
    "the number of starlike objects in this region are 63 , 59 , 67 and 64 for the fields ( a ) through ( d ) in figure [ fourrdlmmnts ] . within poisson statistics , these numbers are entirely consistent with each other .",
    "finally , all objects located below the lower horizontal line near @xmath105 ( i.e. , the pointlike artifacts ) are discarded .",
    "the faint end of the stellar sequence deserves further comment . while the fractional contribution of galaxies in the range @xmath106 mag and @xmath103 is negligible , for @xmath107 mag the starlike sequence is also populated with compact and/or unresolved galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are more numerous on the program fields ( within the cluster ) , and discarding the complete stellar sequence would impose an extreme bias against unresolved galaxies .",
    "thus for these , we simply use the total control field number density to define the background level of unresolved objects .      in 1980",
    ", kron illustrated that the @xmath88 moment provides a measure of the half - light radius for galaxies .",
    "here , we illustrate that the @xmath88 moment is directly related to the scale radius @xmath108 of exponential - profile objects ( e.g. , de galaxies ) .",
    "an exponential profile , defined in terms of the central surface brightness @xmath109 , with @xmath92 measured along the semi - major axis , is given by    @xmath110    evaluating the integral form of ( [ eq : r1 ] ) with @xmath111 given by ( [ eq : exppro ] ) yields @xmath112 . in practice ,",
    "the measured value of @xmath88 is slightly underestimated ( since the integral is evaluated out to @xmath113 and not to @xmath114 ) , and the true radii for the smallest and faintest galaxies are essentially unrecoverable without much better image resolution .",
    "the _ half - flux radius _ @xmath115 provides a different measure of the physical dimension of galaxies .",
    "the flux interior to a specific radius @xmath116 , for the exponential profile given by ( [ eq : exppro ] ) , yields    @xmath117    the half - flux radius is obtained by setting ( [ eq : flux ] ) equal to 1/2 ; we then find @xmath118 .      to measure the ellipticity of faint objects , we adopt a method involving the second - order intensity - weighted central moments described by valdes , tyson & jarvis ( 1983 ; henceforth vtj ) , given by    @xmath119    with the summations taken over all pixels satisfying @xmath120 , and with @xmath86 .",
    "vtj define two quantities involving @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( the semi - major and semi - minor axis lengths ) , given by    @xmath123^{1/2 }   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "( a^2 + b^2 ) & = & m_{\\rm xx } + m_{\\rm yy}. \\label{eq : semiaxes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then , the ellipticity , @xmath124 , and the eccentricity , @xmath125 , are related in the normal manner by    @xmath126    with the quantities calculated in ( [ eq : semiaxes ] ) , a definition of the ellipticity ( ours differs from that used by vjt ) is given by    @xmath127    it is important to note that the ellipticity computed from the moments measured for individual objects will underestimate the true ellipticity for elongated ( and faint ) objects .",
    "this occurs because corrections for small guiding errors and finite seeing are not taken into account ( refer to vtj ) , and because the moments are unstable ( a very low signal - to - noise ratio ) at these low flux levels .",
    "figure [ ellipcomp ] illustrates how the ellipticity estimates scatter about the true value for all objects on the artificial images .",
    "the ellipticity is clearly underestimated for the complete range of galaxy magnitudes , but especially for the fainter galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath124 is over estimated for the faint , intrinsically - round , stellar images . while the ellipticity estimates for the brighter starlike and nonstellar objects are nearly unbiased , for the faint de galaxies @xmath124 is too uncertain to prove useful for this analysis .",
    "the techniques currently in use for faint galaxy photometry include fixed or variable circular apertures , isophotal boundaries , and curve - of - growth analysis and profile - fitting methods ( e.g. , kron 1980 ; jarvis & tyson 1981 ; yee 1991 ; lilly et al .",
    "1991 ; bershady et al . 1994 ; de propris et al . 1995 ; fischer et al .",
    "the approach we use in the dynamo code is based on aperture photometry , where ( as indicated above ) the aperture size depends on the scale radius of the particular object .",
    "if the ccd images are _ uncrowded _ , such that the typical distance between galaxy centers exceeds twice their radii , conventional aperture magnitude techniques provide an accurate method for faint galaxy photometry .",
    "quite simply , aperture magnitudes count the photons received by the detector ; nothing more , and nothing less .",
    "in addition , aperture techniques are straight - forward ; magnitudes and colors are simple to calculate and reproducible .",
    "the definition of an object s total magnitude is straight forward to state ",
    "sum the sky - subtracted flux contained within an aperture enclosing all of the object . in practice",
    ", this is non - trivial to implement for an automated galaxy survey .",
    "the method which we adopt is to define an _ individual aperture radius for each object _ , a radius which is proportional to a measure of its physical dimensions .",
    "kron ( 1980 ) showed that the radial moment @xmath88 ( section 4.3 ) provides a good estimate of the half - light radius for an ensemble of faint galaxy images . both kron ( 1980 ) and bershady et al .",
    "( 1994 ) define a circular aperture of radius of @xmath81 , which when centered on the galaxy encloses the majority of its flux , even for rather elongated objects .",
    "they determine that the @xmath81 radius measures about 90 percent of the flux for exponential - profile galaxies , and about 96 percent for stellar profiles ; these are easily corrected to true total magnitudes using simulations .",
    "however , the flux measured by the @xmath81 radius is significantly less , and thus underestimates the true total magnitude , for galaxies with de vaucouleurs @xmath80 intensity profiles .",
    "thus , we must ask of the ensemble of galaxies we are observing , which have exponential profiles ? as discussed in section 2.3 , our targets of interest , coma cluster des , have an exponential profile . and as discussed by trentham ( 1997 ) , cluster dwarf irregular galaxies and the majority of background galaxies in the range @xmath128 mag also have exponential profiles .",
    "this leaves the coma cluster early - type giants .",
    "as these ellipticals compose only a small fraction of our sample , we simply note that the magnitude correction factor we derive below ( appropriate for des ) may lead to an underestimate of the total magnitudes for these ellipticals .",
    "bershady et al .",
    "( 1994 ) provide a detailed discussion of the @xmath81 total magnitude estimation technique .",
    "briefly , it provides a compromise between total flux and low photometric error , and it is accurate and robust .",
    "we therefore adopt this @xmath81 magnitude , denoted by a subscript @xmath81 , as a measure of total magnitude , realizing that a simple numerical factor will be necessary to obtain true total magnitudes measures virtually unbiased total magnitudes for exponential - profile galaxies . however , the photometric error on the magnitude estimates is greatly increased over the @xmath81 magnitudes , and the larger radius poses definite problems for objects in crowded fields . ] .",
    "note that the radius used for the @xmath81 aperture is defined to be @xmath81 _ or the radius of the seeing disk _ , whichever is the greatest .",
    "for the @xmath5-band coma images , the seeing disk radius used was 3.5 px , which is a @xmath129 radius enclosing 99.73 percent of the flux for stellar objects .",
    "we found , as did bershady et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , that the @xmath81 magnitude is insensitive to changes in seeing , and the slight differences in seeing between our four @xmath5-band master images do not significantly affect our estimates of total magnitude .",
    "once @xmath88 has been calculated accurately , the total instrumental magnitudes can be calculated , by integrating the total flux contained within a circular aperture centered on the peak - flux pixel of the object . the method used here to calculate the total enclosed flux considers fractional - pixel flux , which reduces the ragged - edge effect apparent for small aperture radii ( stetson et al .",
    "for the ensemble of object pixels , @xmath63 denotes the radial distance of the @xmath54 pixel from the peak - flux center , and @xmath85 represents the sky - subtracted pixel intensity .",
    "then the fraction of the @xmath54 pixel which is interior to @xmath81 is given by @xmath130 $ ] , and this fraction of the pixel s flux is included in the summation as as @xmath131 .",
    "the total area @xmath132 within @xmath81 is given by the sum of @xmath133 for the set of object pixels .",
    "then the total instrumental magnitude is given by      normalized to a one - second exposure by the exposure time @xmath135 .",
    "this is converted ( roughly ) to an apparent magnitude with the magnitude zero - point @xmath136 , which represents the magnitude of a star for which the ccd would measure 1 adu per second . while @xmath136 is determined from stellar objects , it represents a simple conversion factor and is directly applicable to all nonstellar objects as well .",
    "the @xmath99 total magnitude was calculated for all objects on both of the artificial ccd images .",
    "figure [ rmagcorrections ] illustrates that for both stars and galaxies , this @xmath99 magnitude consistently provides a reasonable measurement of the true total magnitude , @xmath137 , and for @xmath138 , the scatter in @xmath139 remains less than 0.1 mag - mag too faint represent objects at the edge of the ccd image , while the 10 or so objects measured @xmath140-@xmath141-mag too bright represent inherently faint objects superimposed on brighter objects . ] . ideally , kron s magnitude would measure _ constant fraction _ of the total light , independent of the galaxy s distance or apparent diameter",
    "however , our simulations reveal that the light contained within this @xmath81 aperture varies from about 90 percent for bright galaxies , to 100 percent for faint galaxies .",
    "this occurs as the successively fainter galaxies make the transition from large and resolved to small and unresolved , with all of their light then contained within the seeing profile .    for galaxies with @xmath142 mag",
    ", we adopt a correction factor constant at @xmath143 mag , keeping in mind that this is an underestimate for giant ellipticals with an @xmath80 profile . for galaxies in the range @xmath144 mag",
    ", the magnitude correction factor varies linearly between @xmath145 and 0.0 mag , and we adopt a correction factor given by      over the same magnitude interval , the correction factor for stellar objects varies between @xmath147 and 0.0 . for our coma data",
    "set , we discard objects on the stellar sequence brighter than @xmath148 mag . below this",
    ", we can not discriminate between starlike and non - stellar objects , and we correct total magnitudes for all objects using ( [ eq : deltar ] ) .",
    "thus while our final sample of objects consists of stars and galaxies , any differences between their magnitude correction factors are negligible .    in summary , magnitudes and colors determined via aperture techniques",
    "are robust and accurate provided the image is not crowded . dealing with crowded objects is unavoidably a complex problem .",
    "for crowded starlike objects , the iterative least - squares simultaneous fitting of multiple stellar profiles ( e.g. stetson 1994 ) is an efficient and accurate technique .",
    "for crowded galaxy objects , deconvolution by profile fitting is also possible ( e.g. , fischer et al . 1997 ) .",
    "however , this is a very different approach then our aperture photometry . in this analysis",
    "we use the relative number of objects separated by less than 6 pixels ( i.e. where the seeing disks are overlapping ) as a measure of the degree of crowding . for our coma cluster fields ,",
    "the number of multiple objects was in the range @xmath149 percent of the total , even on the control field .",
    "since this number is so low , this set of objects was discarded , with the assumption that the statistical correlations derived from the data set will not be affected significantly .",
    "we define two measures of surface brightness , the first of which is the central surface brightness @xmath150 ( mag / arcsec@xmath3 ) , defined in terms of the peak - flux pixel intensity . here",
    ", @xmath151 represents the pixel area ( arcsec@xmath3 ) , and @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath136 represent the sky - subtracted intensity of the peak - flux pixel , the exposure time and the magnitude zero - point .",
    "then , the central surface brightness ( mag / arcsec@xmath3 ) is given by        in figure [ simcentsurf ] we plot @xmath150 versus total magnitude @xmath157 for the stars and galaxies on our artificial ccd images .",
    "for both stars and exponential - profile de galaxies , a decrease in @xmath109 corresponds to a decrease in total magnitude , as expected . for stellar objects with their constant gaussian profile ,",
    "@xmath150 is linearly related to @xmath99 , with significant scatter in the relationship beginning near @xmath158 mag . at any magnitude ,",
    "the exponential - profile galaxies have a lower central surface brightness .",
    "in fact , star / galaxy discrimination can be performed rather well in this parameter space , with the advantage that the calculation of @xmath150 does not depend upon summations sensitive to the limiting radius @xmath67 .",
    "second , we define an average surface brightness , @xmath159 , which considers pixels interior to an aperture of radius @xmath4 . of all pixels inside this circular aperture , only those @xmath160 pixels which satisify @xmath161",
    "contribute to @xmath162 , the sky - subtracted pixel sum within the aperture .",
    "then the average surface brightness is given by      note that @xmath159 yields an accurate measure of an object s average surface brightness provided that there are no other objects within the @xmath81 aperture radius .",
    "as well , there will be a small contribution to @xmath162 from poisson sky noise ; in most instances this will be negligible , since this noise scatters about the mean to both higher and lower intensity values .      much of the controversy over the accuracy of integrated colors boils down to whether or not there are color gradients within de and de , n galaxies .",
    "if a uniform color gradient exists within the galaxy ( i.e. , if the @xmath16-band intensity profile falls off differently than the @xmath5-band profile ) , then a constant radius enclosing some fraction of the total @xmath5 luminosity will include a different fraction of the @xmath16 luminosity .",
    "however , recent observations show no such systematic effects in these galaxies .",
    "observations of de galaxies in fornax ( caldwell & bothun 1986 ; cellone , forte & geisler 1994 ) reveal no color gradients , and similar observations of virgo dwarfs ( vader et al .",
    "1988 ; durrell et al .",
    "1997 ; each study examined about 10 des ) show evidence for color gradients in up to 50 percent of the des , yet both red and blue gradients are observed .",
    "as well , the luminous nucleus in the bright de , n galaxies in our sample pose no problems , since the colors of the nuclei are not noticeably different from their surroundings ( caldwell & bothun 1986 ; durrell et al . 1997 ; vader et al . 1988 ) .",
    "we choose to measure colors within an aperture constant for all objects and on all images , with a constant radius comparable to the fwhm of a stellar profile .",
    "since the s / n ratio within a small aperture of radius @xmath164 ( px ) is greater than for the full @xmath81 aperture , this fixed aperture technique yields very accurate colors , provided that the seeing is the same in both filters ( cf .",
    ", section 2.3 ) .",
    "in addition , the fixed aperture colors are independent of the calculation of the @xmath88 radius , and for small @xmath165 they are robust in the presence of nearby objects . at the peak - flux pixel position of the @xmath54 object on the @xmath5 and @xmath16 images ,",
    "the local sky mode is calculated , and the sky - subtracted luminosity is summed within a circular aperture of fixed radius @xmath164 pixels ( @xmath166 kpc for the distance of coma ) . the pixel selection and luminosity summations within the circular aperture are performed in the same manner as those described in section 5.1 .",
    "then the @xmath48 color is defined as the difference of aperture magnitudes , and the corresponding uncertainty is given by summing the individual @xmath5- and @xmath16-band aperture magnitude uncertainties in quadrature ( cf .",
    "section 5.5 ) . note that for any reasonable detection threshold , many of the objects for which we measure colors would not be detected by themselves on the @xmath16-band image .    in figure [ fourcmds ]",
    "we plot the cmds for objects measured on the three cluster fields and on the control field .",
    "the de galaxies are immediately obvious as an excess of objects on the cluster fields , over and above those objects on the control field .",
    "the de galaxies are confined to a well - defined sequence of objects which begins at @xmath167 mag near @xmath168 mag and extends down to the limiting magnitude at @xmath169 mag , spreading in width due to the photometric errors in both magnitude and color ( cf .",
    "figure [ photerrors ] ) . comparing the four cmds in figure [ fourcmds ] ,",
    "it is clear that the de galaxy sequence is continuous , that it is a continuation of the sequence defined by the brighter cluster giants , and that its faint end merges with the faint noncluster galaxies and with galactic g and k main - sequence dwarf and post - main sequence giant stars .",
    "the location of the de sequence in the cmd is consistent with colors found by thompson & gregory ( 1993 ) for coma cluster des , and with integrated colors of globular star clusters ( hopp et al .",
    "our analysis of the mean de galaxy color distribution is presented in paper ii .",
    "these cmds provide a convenient parameter space to cull our sample of objects and remove the obvious noncluster galaxies .",
    "the vertical dotted lines at @xmath170 mag and at @xmath171 mag represent generous limits to the de galaxy sequence . outside of this color range , the majority of the objects are foreground galactic stars and galaxies more distant than the coma cluster : for @xmath172 mag , all four cmds are very sparsely populated , and for @xmath173 , the density of objects on the cluster field cmds is similar to the control field .",
    "the lower horizontal dotted line at @xmath169 mag corresponds to our adopted magnitude and color completeness limit ( paper ii ) ; at this magnitude limit we are @xmath174 percent complete in detection and almost 100 percent complete in color .",
    "all objects fainter than this limit are discarded .",
    "thus , in paper ii we restrict our analysis to the subset of the objects within the color range @xmath175 mag and @xmath148 mag , greatly decreasing the contamination in our sample of candidate de galaxies .",
    "in addition , we use the distribution of objects in the control - field cmd to statistically correct the sample of objects detected on the program fields , to further reduce the effects of contamination .",
    "lastly , we note that fainter than @xmath169 mag , there appears to be an increase in the number of blue objects on each of the three program field cmds , over and above the number on the control field .",
    "this excess is consistent with a spread in the measured de colors which increase dramatically past @xmath176 mag .",
    "a similar spread does not occur on the red side because of the strong @xmath0band incompleteness there .",
    "uncertainties on our @xmath81 magnitudes and our fixed - aperture colors are estimated in the manner described by harris et al .",
    "we begin by estimating the uncertainty on sky - subtracted intensity sum @xmath162 , for which the total variance results from three significant contributions .",
    "we denote the area of the sky annulus ( integer pixels ) used to estimate @xmath65 by @xmath177 , the standard deviation of the pixel - to - pixel scatter ( in adu ) in the sky annulus by @xmath178 , and the number of pixels in the aperture containing the object by @xmath132 .",
    "first , the variance due to photon noise from the object itself is given by @xmath179 ( @xmath21 ) , where @xmath180 is the ccd gain ( @xmath21/adu ) .",
    "second , the random scatter in the sky pixels under the object contributes a variance equal to @xmath181 ( @xmath21 ) , which corresponds to product of the number of pixels in the aperture and the variance per pixel .",
    "third , the standard error of the mean for the local sky intensity is given by @xmath182 ( @xmath21 ) , so that the variance arising from a possible systematic error in the modal sky level is given by @xmath183 .",
    "for faint stars and for normal situations where @xmath185 , the poisson sky noise dominates , and ( [ eq : intuncer ] ) reduces to @xmath186 .",
    "if we define upper and lower limits on @xmath162 to be @xmath187 and @xmath188 , then a rough error estimate on the magnitude is half of the magnitude difference , given by      then , the total uncertainty on our aperture magnitudes and colors is given by @xmath190 added in quadrature with the uncertainty in the magnitude zeropoint , @xmath191 , derived from standard star observations . in figure [ photerrors ]",
    "we plot the uncertainties in @xmath99 magnitude ( dots ) and color ( crosses ) versus @xmath99 magnitude for all detected and measured objects on our four progam fields . in summary ,",
    "typical uncertainties for @xmath192 mag are @xmath193 mag in total magnitude , and @xmath1940.12 mag in color .",
