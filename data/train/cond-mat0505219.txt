    "in this work we consider the universality class of directed percolation ( dp , see  @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "because of its robustness and ubiquity , ( including critical phenomena in physics , biology , epidemiology , as well as catalytic chemical reactions ) directed percolation is recognized as the paradigm of non - equilibrium phase transitions into absorbing states .",
    "these so - called absorbing phase transitions arise from a competition of opposing processes , usually creation and annihilation processes .",
    "the transition point separates an active phase from an absorbing phase in which the dynamics is frozen .",
    "analogous to equilibrium critical phenomena , absorbing phase transitions can be grouped into different universality classes .",
    "all systems belonging to a given universality class share the same critical exponents , and certain scaling functions ( e.g.  equation of state , correlation functions , finite - size scaling functions , etc . ) become identical near the critical point . according to the universality hypothesis of janssen and grassberger , short - range interacting models , exhibiting a continuous phase transition into a unique absorbing state , belong to the directed percolation universality class , if they are characterized by a one - component order parameter and no additional symmetries  @xcite .    similar to equilibrium critical phenomena ,",
    "the universality of directed percolation is understood by renormalization group treatments of an associated continuous field theory .",
    "the process of directed percolation might be represented by the langevin equation  @xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 corresponds to the density of active sites on a mesoscopic scale and @xmath2  describes the distance to the critical point .",
    "furthermore , @xmath3 denotes the noise which accounts for fluctuations of @xmath1 . according to the central limit theorem",
    ", @xmath4 is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and whose correlator is given by @xmath5 notice , that the latter equation ensures that the system is trapped in the absorbing state @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , higher order terms such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 are irrelevant under renormalization group transformations as long as @xmath10",
    ". negative values of @xmath11 give rise to a first order phase transition whereas @xmath12 is associated with a tricritical point  @xcite .    above",
    "the upper critical dimension  @xmath13 mean field theories apply and present instructive insight into the critical behavior  @xcite .",
    "below  @xmath13 , renormalization group techniques have to be applied to determine the critical exponents and the scaling functions ( see  @xcite for recent reviews of the field theoretical treatment of directed percolation ) . in that case path integral formulations are more adequate than the langevin equation .",
    "stationary correlation functions as well as response functions can be determined by calculating path integrals with weight @xmath14 , where the dynamic functional @xmath15 describes the considered stochastic process . up to higher irrelevant orders the dynamic functional associated with directed percolation",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath16 \\ ; = \\ ; \\int { \\mathrm d}^d{\\underline x } \\ , { \\mathrm d}t \\ ; { \\tilde n }   \\ , \\left [ \\ ,   \\partial_{\\scriptscriptstyle t } n   -   ( r + \\nabla^2 ) n   -   \\left (   \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\ , { \\tilde n }   - u \\ , n \\right ) n \\ ,   \\right ] \\label{eq : action_reggeon_field_theory}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes the response field conjugated to the langevin noise field  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the above functional is well known from high energy physics and corresponds to the lagrangian of reggeon field theory  @xcite . since dp represents the simplest realization of a nonequilibrium phase transition its field theory",
    "is often regarded as the nonequilibrium counterpart of the famous @xmath18-theory of equilibrium  @xcite . rescaling the fields @xmath19",
    "the functional @xmath20 is invariant under the duality transformation ( so - called rapidity reversal in reggeon field theory ) @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath23 is a redundant variable from the renormalization group point of view  @xcite .",
    "the rapidity reversal  ( [ eq : rapidity_trans ] ) is the characteristic symmetry of the universality class of directed percolation .",
    "it is worth to reemphasize that the rapidity reversal is obtained from a field theoretical treatment .",
    "thus all models that belong to the universality class of directed percolation obey , at least asymptotically , the rapidity reversal after a corresponding coarse grained procedure  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the rapidity symmetry may not be represented in the microscopic models .",
    "for example , bond directed percolation  @xcite and site directed percolation  @xcite obey the rapidity reversal microscopically whereas e.g.  the contact process and the pair contact process do not .",
    "still , the latter two models do so asymptotically and belong to the dp class .",
    "due to the continuing improvement of computer hardware , high accurate numerical data of dp have become available in the last years , resulting in a fruitful and instructive interplay between numerical investigations and renormalization group analyses . in particular , investigations of the scaling behavior of the equation of state and of the susceptibility  @xcite , of finite - size scaling functions  @xcite , and of dynamical scaling functions  @xcite",
    "yield an impressive agreement between field theoretical and numerical results .",
    "for example , the universal amplitude ratio of the susceptibility has been calculated via @xmath24-expansions  @xcite . in second order of @xmath24 , the error of the field theory estimate",
    "is about  @xmath25 for @xmath26  ( see ref.@xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare this result to the equilibrium situation .",
    "the corresponding @xmath18-theory value  @xcite differs from the exact value of the two - dimensional ising model  @xcite by roughly @xmath27 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the @xmath18-theory the dp field theory provides excellent numerical estimates of certain universal quantities .    in our previous works we investigated the steady state critical scaling behavior of two one - dimensional models  @xcite and of one model in various dimensions  @xcite , respectively .",
    "in this work we extend our investigations and consider the steady state and dynamical scaling behavior of five different models in various dimensions .",
    "all lattice models are expected to belong to the universality class of directed percolation .",
    "so far , most works focus on the determination of the critical exponents only , neglecting the determination of universal scaling functions .",
    "it turns out that checking the universality class it is often a more exact test to consider scaling functions rather than the values of the critical exponents . while for the latter ones the variations between different universality classes",
    "are often small , the scaling functions may differ significantly  @xcite .",
    "thus the agreement of universal scaling functions provides not only additional but also independent and more convincing evidence in favor of the conjecture that the phase transitions of two models belong to the same universality class .",
    "additionly to the critical exponents and scaling functions , universality classes are also characterized by certain amplitude combinations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "but these amplitude combinations are merely particular values of the scaling functions and will be neglected in this work .",
    "in the following we consider various lattice models that belong to the universality class of directed percolation .",
    "first , we revisit the contact process that is well known in the mathematical literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "second , we consider the domany - kinzel cellular automaton  @xcite which is very useful in order to perform numerical investigations of directed bond and directed site percolation .",
    "third , we consider the pair contact process  @xcite that is characterized in contrast to the other models by infinitely many absorbing states . unlike the first two models the universal scaling behavior of the pair contact process is still a matter of discussions in the literature .",
    "furthermore , we briefly discuss the threshold transfer process  @xcite as well as the ziff - gulari - barshad model  @xcite .",
    "the latter one mimics the catalysis of carbon monoxide oxidation .",
    "the contact process ( cp ) is a continuous - time markov process that is usually defined on a @xmath28-dimensional simple cubic lattice ( see  @xcite and references therein )",
    ". a lattice site may be empty ( @xmath29 ) or occupied ( @xmath30 ) by a particle and the dynamics is characterized by spontaneously occurring processes , taking place with certain transition rates . in numerical simulations",
    "the asynchronous update is realized by a random sequential update scheme :  a particle on a randomly selected lattice site  @xmath31 is annihilated with rate one , whereas particle creation takes places on an empty neighboring site with rate @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 where  @xmath34 denotes the number of occupied neighbors of  @xmath35 .",
    "note that the rates are defined as transition probabilities per time unit , i.e. , they may be larger than one .",
    "thus , rescaling the time will change the transition rates . in simulations a discrete time formulation of the contact process",
    "is performed . in that case",
    "a particle creation takes place at a randomly chosen neighbor site with probability @xmath36 whereas particle annihilation occurs with probability @xmath37 . in dynamical simulations ,",
    "the time increment @xmath38 is associated with each attempted elementary update step , where @xmath39 denotes the number of active sites .",
    "it is usual to present the critical value in terms of @xmath40 instead of  @xmath41 .",
    "similar to equilibrium phase transitions , it is often possible for absorbing phase transitions to apply an external field  @xmath42 that is conjugated to the order parameter , i.e. , to the density of active sites  @xmath43 .",
    "being a conjugated field it has to destroy the absorbing phase , it has to be independent of the control parameter , and the corresponding linear response function has to diverge at the critical point @xmath44 in case of the cp , the conjugated field is implemented by a spontaneous creation of particles , i.e. , the external field creates a particle at an empty lattice site with rate  @xmath42 .",
    "clearly spontaneous particle generation destroys the absorbing state and therefore the absorbing phase transition at all . incorporating the conjugated field ,",
    "a series of opportunities is offered to compare renormalization group results to those of numerical investigations .",
    "for example , simulations performed for non - zero field include the measurements of the equation of state  @xcite , of the susceptibility  @xcite , as well as of a modified finite - size scaling analysis appropriate for absorbing phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "an important @xmath45-dimensional stochastic cellular automaton exhibiting directed percolation scaling behavior is the domany - kinzel ( dk ) automaton  @xcite .",
    "it is defined on a diagonal square lattice with a discrete time variable and evolves by parallel update according to the following rules :  a site at time @xmath46 is occupied with probability  @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) if both ( only one ) backward sites ( at time @xmath49 ) are occupied .",
    "otherwise the site remains empty .",
    "if both backward sites are empty a spontaneous particle creation takes place with probability @xmath50 .",
    "similar to the contact process , the spontaneous particle creation destroys the absorbing phase ( empty lattice ) and corresponds therefore to the conjugated field  @xmath42 .",
    "it is straight forward to generalize the @xmath45-dimensional domany - kinzel automaton to higher dimensions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the following ,",
    "we consider cellular automata on a @xmath51-dimensional body centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice where the time corresponds to the @xmath52 $ ] direction . a lattice site at time  @xmath46 is occupied with probability  @xmath53 if at least one of its @xmath54 backward neighboring sites ( at time @xmath49 ) is occupied .",
    "otherwise the site remains empty .",
    "this parameter choice corresponds to the probabilities @xmath55 , i.e. , site - directed percolation ( sdp ) is considered .",
    "the pair contact process ( pcp ) was introduced by jensen  @xcite and is one of the simplest models with infinitely many absorbing states showing a continuous phase transition .",
    "the process is defined on a @xmath28-dimensional cubic lattice and an asynchronous ( random sequential ) update scheme is applied .",
    "a lattice site may be either occupied ( @xmath30 ) or empty ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "pairs of adjacent occupied sites , linked by an active bond , annihilate each other with probability  @xmath53 otherwise an offspring is created at a neighboring site provided the target site is empty . the density of active bonds @xmath56 is the order parameter of a continuous phase transition from an active state to an inactive absorbing state without particle pairs .",
    "similar to the contact process and to the domany - kinzel automaton a spontaneous particle creation acts as a conjugated field  @xcite . since isolated particles remain inactive , any configuration containing only isolated particles is absorbing . in case of the @xmath45-dimensional pair contact process with @xmath57  sites and periodic boundary conditions the number of absorbing states",
    "is asymptotically given by the golden mean @xmath58  @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath59 ) , the pair contact process is characterized by infinitely many absorbing states . due to that non - unique absorbing phase",
    "the universality hypothesis of janssen and grassberger can not be applied .",
    "therefore , the critical behavior of the pair contact process was intensely investigated by simulations ( including  @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown numerically that the critical scaling behavior of the @xmath45-dimensional pair contact process is characterized by the same critical exponents  @xcite as well as by the same universal scaling functions as directed percolation  @xcite .",
    "in particular the latter result provides a convincing identification of the universal behavior .",
    "thus despite the different structure of the absorbing phase , the @xmath45-dimensional pair contact process belongs to the directed percolation universality class .",
    "this numerical evidence confirms a corresponding renormalization group analysis predicting dp universal behavior  @xcite in all dimensions .",
    "but the scaling behavior of the pcp in higher dimension is still a matter of controversial discussions .",
    "a recently performed renormalization group analysis conjectures that the pair contact process exhibits a dynamical percolation - like scaling behavior  @xcite .",
    "a dynamical percolation cluster at criticality equals a fractal cluster of ordinary percolation on the same lattice .",
    "thus , the dynamical percolation universality class  @xcite differs from the directed percolation universality class .",
    "in particular the upper critical dimension equals instead of for dp .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical scaling behavior of the pcp is a matter of controversial discussions .",
    "deviations from the directed percolation behavior due to strong corrections to scaling  @xcite as well as non - universal behavior of the exponents  @xcite are observed in low dimension systems .",
    "so far , the investigations of the pcp are limited to the @xmath45-dimensional  @xcite and @xmath60-dimensional  @xcite systems . in this work",
    "we consider for the first time the pcp in higher dimensions and identify the scaling behavior via universal scaling functions .",
    "the threshold transfer process ( ttp ) was introduced in  @xcite . here",
    ", lattice sites may be empty ( @xmath29 ) , occupied by one particle ( @xmath30 ) , or occupied by two particles ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "double occupied lattice sites are considered as active . in that case",
    "both particles may move to the left ( @xmath62 ) or right ( @xmath63 ) neighbor if possible , i.e. , @xmath64 additionally to the particle movement , creation and annihilation processes are incorporated .",
    "a particle is created at an empty lattice site ( @xmath65 ) with probability  @xmath2 whereas a particle annihilation ( @xmath66 ) takes place with probability @xmath67 . in the absence of double occupied sites the dynamics",
    "is characterized by a fluctuating steady state with a density  @xmath2 of single occupied sites .",
    "the density of double occupied sites is identified as the order parameter of the process , and any configuration devoid of double occupied sites is absorbing .",
    "the probability  @xmath2 controls the particle density , and a non - zero density of active sites occurs only for sufficiently large values of  @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to the infinitely many frozen absorbing configurations of the pair contact process , the threshold transfer process is characterized by fluctuating absorbing states .",
    "nevertheless steady state numerical simulations of the @xmath45-dimensional threshold transfer process yield critical exponents that are in agreement with the corresponding dp values  @xcite .",
    "so far , no systematic analysis of the ttp in higher dimensions was performed .    in this work",
    "we limit our investigations to the @xmath60-dimensional ttp .",
    "analogous to the @xmath45-dimensional case , both particles of a given active site are tried to transfer to randomly chosen empty or single occupied nearest neighbor sites .",
    "furthermore , we apply an external field that is conjugated to the order parameter . in contrast to the models discussed above the conjugated field",
    "can not be implemented by particle creation . particle creation with rate",
    "@xmath42 would affect the particle density , i.e. , the control parameter of the phase transition .",
    "but the conjugated field has to be independent of the control parameter .",
    "therefore , we implement the conjugated field by a diffusion - like field that acts by particle movements .",
    "a particle on a given lattice site moves to a randomly selected neighbor with probability  @xmath42 , if @xmath68 .",
    "thus the conjugated field of the ttp differs from the conjugated field of the domany - kinzel automaton , the contact process , and the pair contact process .",
    "another model exhibiting a directed percolation - like absorbing phase transition is the ziff - gulari - barshad ( zgb ) model  @xcite .",
    "this model mimics the heterogeneous catalysis of the carbon monoxide oxidation @xmath69 on a catalytic material , e.g.  platinum .",
    "the catalytic surface is represented by a square lattice where @xmath70 or @xmath71 can be adsorbed from a gas phase with concentration @xmath72 for carbon monoxide and @xmath73 for oxygen , respectively .",
    "the concentration @xmath72 is the control parameter of the model determining the density of the components on the catalytic surface .",
    "adsorbed oxygen molecules dissociate at the catalytic surface into pairs of @xmath74  atoms .",
    "it is assumed that the lattice sites are either empty , occupied by a @xmath70 molecule , or occupied by an @xmath74 atom .",
    "adjacent @xmath70 and @xmath74 react instantaneously and the resulting @xmath75 molecule leaves the system .",
    "obviously , the system is trapped in absorbing configurations if the lattice is completely covered by carbon monoxide or completely covered by oxygen .",
    "the dynamics of the system is attracted by these absorbing configurations for sufficiently large @xmath70 concentrations and for sufficiently large @xmath71 concentrations .",
    "numerical simulations show that catalytic activity occurs in the range  @xcite only .",
    "the system undergoes a second order phase transition to the oxygen passivated phase whereas a first order phase transition takes place if the @xmath70 passivated phase is approached .",
    "in particular , the continuous phase transition is expected to belong to the universality class of directed percolation  @xcite .",
    "this conjecture is supported by numerical determinations of certain critical exponents  @xcite . at first glance , it might be surprising that the zgb model exhibits directed percolation like behavior since the zgb model is characterized by two distinct chemical components , @xmath70 and @xmath74 .",
    "but the catalytic activity is connected to the density of vacant sites , i.e. , to a single component order parameter  @xcite .",
    "thus the observed directed percolation exponents are in full agreement with the universality hypothesis of janssen and grassberger .",
    "but one has to stress that the zgb model is an oversimplified representation of the catalytic carbon monoxide oxidation .",
    "a more realistic modeling has to incorporate for example mobility and desorption processes as well as a repulsive interaction between adsorbed oxygen molecules ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these features affect the critical behavior and drive the experimental system out of the directed percolation universality class .",
    "in this work , we focus on the two - dimensional zgb model and determine certain scaling functions for the first time .",
    "therefore , we apply an external field conjugated to the order parameter . since the order parameter is connected to the density of vacant sites of the catalytic reaction , the conjugated field could be implemented via a desorption rate  @xmath42 of adsorbed oxygen molecules .",
    "+ in summary , we investigate the scaling behavior of five different models spanning a broad range of interaction details , such as different update schemes ( random sequential as well as parallel update ) , different lattice structures ( simple cubic and bcc lattice types ) , different inactive backgrounds ( trivial , fluctuating or quenched background of inactive particles ) , different structures of the absorbing phase ( unique absorbing state or infinitely many absorbing states ) , as well as different implementations of the conjugated field ( implemented via particle creation , particle diffusion or particle desorption ) .",
    "nevertheless we will see that all models are characterized by the same scaling behavior , i.e. , they belong to the same universality class .",
    "in this section we consider the steady state scaling behavior close to the transition point .",
    "therefore , we performed steady state simulations of the five models described above .",
    "in particular , we consider the density of active sites @xmath76 , i.e. , the order parameter as a function of the control parameter and of the conjugated field .",
    "analogous to equilibrium phase transitions , the conjugated field results in a rounding of the zero - field curves and the order parameter behaves smoothly as a function of the control parameter for finite field values ( see figure[fig : ttp_op_fluc_01 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath77 we recover the non - analytical order parameter behavior . additionally to the order parameter",
    ", we investigate the order parameter fluctuations @xmath78 and its susceptibility  @xmath79 .",
    "the susceptibility is obtained by performing the numerical derivative of the order parameter @xmath43 with respect to the conjugated field ( [ eq : lin_resp_apt ] ) .",
    "similar to the equilibrium phase transitions , the fluctuations and the susceptibility display a characteristic peak at the critical point . in the limit @xmath77",
    "this peak diverges , signalling the critical point .     and its fluctuations  @xmath80 ( inset ) of the @xmath60-dimensional transfer threshold process ( ttp ) on a square lattice for various values of the field ( from @xmath81 to @xmath82 ) .",
