    "<S> we report measurements of the thermal expansion for two eu@xmath0- and two gd@xmath1-based intermetallics which exhibit ferro- or antiferromagnetic phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> these materials show sharp positive ( euagmg and gdaumg ) and negative ( euaumg and gdagmg ) peaks in the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath2 which become smeared and/or displaced in an external magnetic field . together with specific heat data we determine the initial pressure dependences of the transition temperatures at ambient pressure using the ehrenfest or clausius - clapeyron relation . </S>",
    "<S> we find large pressure dependences indicating strong spin - phonon coupling , in particular for gdagmg and euaumg where a quantum phase transition might be reached at moderate pressures of a few  gpa .    </S>",
    "<S> there has been a continuing interest in the equiatomic ternary intermetallic compounds based upon eu and gd rare earths , the noble metals ag and au , and mg.@xcite in particular through the past ten years their synthesis , chemical and physical properties have been studied in some detail.@xcite the eu - based crystallize with the orthorhombic tinisi structure , while the gd - based materials adopt the zrnial structure . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the electronic structure has been determined by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy and compared with lda+u band structure calculations.@xcite here the valency , eu@xmath0 and gd@xmath1 , was firmly established and a variety of @xmath3-conduction bands were found at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> one unusual feature of the photoemission spectra was the localized nature of the ag and au @xmath4-bands below @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> since both eu@xmath0 and gd@xmath1 possess large magnetic moments ( @xmath6 ) , their magnetic ordering properties , mediated by the oscillating amplitude rkky interaction , may strongly depend on spin - orbit and spin - lattice couplings . </S>",
    "<S> a recent investigation has characterized many of the bulk thermodynamic and transport properties related to the ferromagnetic transitions of euagmg , euaumg and gdagmg and the antiferromagnetic one of gdaumg.@xcite information about the above - mentioned magnetoelastic behavior can be obtained from measurements of the thermal expansion .    in this work we present the results of thermal expansion measured over a large temperature range ( 4 to 200  k ) in applied magnetic fields reaching 14  t. we observe sharp peaks at the magnetic phase transitions in the uniaxial thermal expansion @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the sample length and @xmath9 its temperature - induced change . in all four compounds we observe pronounced anomalies @xmath10 at the magnetic ordering transitions . for euagmg and gdaumg </S>",
    "<S> the sign of @xmath10 is positive , while it is negative for euaumg and gdagmg . </S>",
    "<S> these anomalies are smeared and/or displaced upon applying the magnetic field . by comparing @xmath11 with the corresponding anomalies @xmath12 of the specific heat  @xcite at @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the pressure dependences of the critical temperatures for a first- or second - order phase transition via the clausius - clapeyron or the ehrenfest relation , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the results are most interesting for the ferromagnets gdagmg and euaumg , where we find a first- and a second - order phase transition , respectively , with very large negative pressure dependences of @xmath14 . in both materials , a finite pressure of the order of a few  gpa should drive @xmath14 to zero suggesting pressure - induced quantum phase transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> polycrystalline samples of the above compounds were synthesized , annealed and characterized as described previously.@xcite the thermal expansion was measured in a capacitance dilatometer inserted in a @xmath15he gas - flow cryostat covering a temperature range from about 2 to 300  k.@xcite by using a superconducting magnet , fields up to 14  t could be applied over the entire temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the length changes @xmath16 could be accurately detected through the magnetic transitions with and without the external field .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) thermal expansion @xmath2 , ( b ) relative length change @xmath16 , and ( c , d ) specific heat of antiferromagnetic gdaumg for different magnetic fields.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    figure  [ gdau](a ) displays @xmath17 in various magnetic fields for gdaumg . </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetic ordering at @xmath18  k causes a step - like anomaly @xmath19 of positive sign , which is typical for a second - order phase transition without pronounced fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> a very similar anomaly is present in the specific heat as shown in figure  [ gdau](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced thermal expansion below @xmath20 signals a spontaneous contraction in the magnetically ordered phase , which is also directly seen in @xmath21 displayed in figure  [ gdau](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the application of a magnetic field causes a systematic shift of the anomalies @xmath10 and @xmath22 towards lower temperature , signaling a decreasing @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected the antiferromagnetic order is destabilized by a magnetic field , although the rate @xmath24  </S>",
    "<S> k / t in 14  t appears relatively large in view of the high @xmath20 .     </S>",
    "<S> thermal expansion @xmath2 of the ferromagnetic compounds ( a )  euaumg and ( b )  euagmg for various magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the respective insets  ( c ) and  ( d ) show the relative length changes @xmath16 for zero field.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    figure  [ eu ] shows @xmath17 in various fields for euaumg and euagmg , which order ferromagnetically at @xmath25  k and 22  k , respectively . in zero field </S>",
    "<S> we again find a step - like anomaly @xmath10 for euaumg . </S>",
    "<S> however , in contrast to gdaumg the sign of @xmath10 is negative meaning that the ferromagnetic ordering in euaumg is accompanied by a spontaneous expansion as shown in figure  [ eu](c ) . for euagmg the sign of the zero - field anomaly @xmath10 is again positive , i.e.  a spontaneous contraction occurs , but in this case @xmath10 has a lambda - like shape as it is typical for a second - order phase transition where the fluctuations are more pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> such a difference in the anomaly shapes is also present in the specific heat anomalies.@xcite for both eu - based compounds the application of a magnetic field causes a drastic broadening of the anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> this is typical for a ferromagnet because a sizeable dmagnetic field induces a strong magnetization already well above the zero - field @xmath14 . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization does not develop spontaneously below a critical temperature anymore and , strictly speaking , a ferromagnetic transition temperature can only be defined for zero magnetic field .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) thermal expansion @xmath2 and ( b ) relative length changes @xmath16  ( b ) of the ferromagnet gdagmg for various magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the inset  ( c ) shows an expanded view of @xmath2 in order to visualize the additional anomaly at 125  k.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    in the ferromagnet gdagmg we observe a huge anomaly @xmath26 of negative sign at @xmath27  k as is illustrated in figure  [ gdag](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the @xmath2 anomaly corresponds to an almost jump - like change of @xmath28 as shown in figure  [ gdag](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a clear indication for a first - order transition in gdagmg , in agreement with our conclusions from the specific heat measurements , where a very similar anomaly shape is present at @xmath14.@xcite moreover , we observe an additional smaller anomaly of @xmath2 at @xmath29  k which hardly changes in an applied magnetic field , see figure  [ gdag](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the sharp low - temperature anomaly drastically broadens and shifts upwards in temperature . in the highest field </S>",
    "<S> this broadening even extends to temperatures above about 175  k , i.e.  to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> based on an analysis of the entropy change we suspected that the complete magnetic ordering in gdagmg might be achieved via both transitions at @xmath14 and @xmath31.@xcite however , the transition at @xmath31 is not seen in our measurements of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath32 . above about 50  k </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath32 shows clear curie - weiss behavior , i.e.  @xmath33 with @xmath34  k and @xmath35 close to the expected values of a ferromagnet with an @xmath36 and @xmath27  k. this and the very different field dependences , in particular the fact that the field - induced broadening of the @xmath14 anomaly even exceeds to @xmath37 , makes a common origin of both anomalies very unlikely .    </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath31 does not change with field , one may suspect a structural origin of this anomaly , however , no low - temperature diffraction data have been recorded yet . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the @xmath31 anomaly could arise from small amounts of impurity phases , e.g.  gdag and gdmg . </S>",
    "<S> although our sample shows phase purity in x - ray powder diffraction , we can not exclude the presence of a few  % of such impurity phases . </S>",
    "<S> both of these binary intermetallic compounds exhibit magnetic phase transitions between 96 and 130  k.@xcite in gdmg a ferromagnetic order occurs at 120  k followed by a canting transition at 96  k , while a single antiferromagnetic phase develops in gdag below 133  k. the presence of gdmg appears also to be unlikely , since even for a few  % of such an impurity phase the spontaneous magnetization due to the ferromagnetic order should be visible in @xmath38 and the anomaly should broaden in a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the presence of a few  % of gdag can not be excluded from our data : ( i ) due to the large background of the paramagnetic majority phase the expected weak magnetization change at @xmath20 can not be resolved in @xmath38 , and ( ii ) magnetic fields up to 14 t will not affect the antiferromagnetic order since the ordering temperature is so high . </S>",
    "<S> because the @xmath31 anomaly most probably arises from an impurity phase , it will not be considered in the following discussion of the pressure dependences .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements of thermal expansion and specific heat at ambient pressure allow to derive the initial slope of the change of @xmath39 under finite pressure using either the clausius - clapeyron for a first - order transition @xmath40 or the ehrenfest relation for a second - order phase transition . @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> the jump - like changes of the volume and entropy are obtained via integration @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature range of integration around @xmath39 reflects the broadening of the first - order phase transition , which is always finite in a real solid . </S>",
    "<S> we note that one has to use @xmath44 here and in equation  ( [ ehre ] ) , since the hydrostatic pressure dependence is related to the volume expansion @xmath45 , which is given by @xmath46 for a homogeneous polycrystal .    </S>",
    "<S> .some characteristic properties of @xmath47 mg . [ tab ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the obtained pressure dependences @xmath48 together with some other characteristic properties are given in table  [ tab ] for all four compounds . obviously , we obtain rather large absolute values of @xmath49 of different signs depending on the sign of the respective @xmath2 anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> these large values confirm the presence of a large spin - lattice coupling in these @xmath47 mg compounds , which we attribute to the oscillatory nature of the rkky interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this may also be the main reason for the variation from ferro- to antiferromagnetic order and the wide range of different transition temperatures in the different @xmath47 mg compounds , although their structures are not too different . </S>",
    "<S> we find the largest pressure dependence in gdagmg and associate this with the first - order nature of the magnetic transition . in order to drive a magnetic phase transition to first order </S>",
    "<S> a strong spin - lattice coupling is required and this would also provide the mechanism for a large pressure dependence @xmath49 .    we emphasize that our estimates of @xmath48 based on the ehrenfest or the clausius - clapeyron relation only yield the initial slopes at ambient pressure and extrapolations of our data to finite pressure have to be treated with caution . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the obtained negative values of @xmath50 and @xmath51  k / gpa for euaumg and gdagmg , respectively , are so large , that a complete suppression of the ferromagnetic order may be reached for both compounds when a rather moderate hydrostatic pressure of a few gpa is applied . </S>",
    "<S> therefore both compounds are interesting candidates where pressure - induced quantum phase transitions can be studied .    in summary , due to the significant spin - lattice coupling we were able to probe the magnetic ordering transitions of euagmg , gdaumg , euaumg and gdagmg via thermal expansion measurements . </S>",
    "<S> using also specific heat data we were able to derive the initial pressure shifts of @xmath13 , which are rather large for all four compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the largest effects are observed in euaumg and gdagmg and in both materials the ferromagnetic order is expected to be completely suppressed by hydrostatic pressure of a few gpa . </S>",
    "<S> direct high - pressure experiments of @xmath39 on these compounds are highly desirable .    </S>",
