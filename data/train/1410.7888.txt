    "a classical nova is a thermonuclear runaway event on a mass - accreting white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary .",

    "@xcite also found that their uv 1455    model light curves @xcite , interpreted as photospheric blackbody emission , are also time - normalized by the same factor as in the optical and nir light curves .",
    "using the fact that the time - scaling factor is closely related to the wd mass , the authors determined the wd mass and other parameters for a number of well - observed novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite further obtained absolute magnitudes of their model light curves and derived their maximum magnitude vs. rate of decline ( mmrd ) relation .",
    "such mmrd relations were empirically proposed , e.g. , by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for individual novae ,",
    "however , there is large scatter around the proposed trends ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hachisu & kato s ( 2010 ) theoretical mmrd relation is governed by two parameters , one is the wd mass and the other is the initial envelope mass at the nova outburst , i.e. , the ignition mass .",
    "the ignition mass depends on the mass - accretion rate to the wd .",
    "the higher the mass - accretion rate is , the smaller the ignition mass is ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in other words , the smaller the mass accretion rate is , the brighter the maximum magnitude is .",
    "so , they concluded that this second parameter ( the ignition mass ) explains scatter of the mmrd distribution of individual novae from the averaged trend that was determined mainly by the wd mass .",

    ", @xcite found that , if two nova light curves overlap each other after one of the two is squeezed / stretched by a factor of @xmath314 ( @xmath315 ) in the time direction , the brightnesses of the two novae obey the relation of @xmath316 , which is the same as equation ( [ simple_final_scaling_flux ] ) . based on this property , they derived a mmrd relation of @xmath317 for the chemical composition of `` co nova 2 , '' i.e. , equation ( 35 ) in @xcite .",
    "we can again derive a similar trend , @xmath318 , i.e. , equation ( [ theoretical_mmrd_relation ] ) , for another chemical composition , `` co nova 4 , '' in appendix [ absolute_magnitudes ] .",
    "note that these two relations are in good agreement with kaler - schmidt s law .",
    "the main trend of the mmrd relation is governed by the wd mass : the more massive a wd is , the steeper the decline of a nova light curve is .",
    "@xcite further showed that the maximum brightness of a nova also depends on the initial envelope mass ( ignition mass ) .",
    "this initial envelope mass depends on the mass - accretion rate to the wd ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent result ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that the scatter of individual mmrd points is due to various mass - accretion rates to the wd even for the same wd mass .",
    "the brighter the nova is , the smaller the mass accretion rate to the wd is ( see figure 15 of * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite concluded that dq  her and gk  per almost follow the mmrd relation ( mmrd1 ) but v603  aql and rr  pic do not ( see figure [ max_t3_point_b_scale_pw_vul_no3 ] ) .",
    "we examine the reason for about 1  mag faintness of v603  aql compared with the blue solid line ( mmrd1 relation ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed the light curves of v1500  cyg and v603  aql and concluded that both of these novae harbor a @xmath319 wd for the envelope chemical composition of `` ne nova 2 . ''",
    "we estimated the initial envelope masses for these two novae , that is , @xmath320 for the @xmath117 wd model of v1500  cyg and @xmath321 for v603  aql .",
    "the initial envelope mass corresponds to the envelope mass at optical maximum ( see figure [ v603_aql_v1500_cyg_x55z02o10ne03_logscale_2fig ] ) . thus , the difference in the ignition masses makes the apparent difference in the start time of the outbursts and in the peak brightness as shown in figure [ v603_aql_v1500_cyg_x55z02o10ne03_logscale_2fig ] .",
    "this is the main source for scatter of individual mmrd points around the proposed mmrd relation .",
    "therefore , a smaller initial envelope mass is the main reason that v603  aql is fainter by @xmath322 mag than the blue solid line of mmrd1 .",
    "now we first examine the case of pw  vul among the seven novae studied in the present work .",
    "the mmrd point of pw  vul locates slightly ( 0.2 mag ) above kaler - schmidt s law ( mmrd1 ) , a blue thick solid line in figure [ max_t3_point_b_scale_pw_vul_no3 ] .",
    "remember that our free - free emission model light curves usually follow the averaged mmrd relation of mmrd1 ( kaler & schmidt s law ) .",
    "thus , the agreement of pw  vul with the mmrd1 relation indicates that the initial envelope mass of pw  vul was a typical one for @xmath105 wds and also that free - free emission dominates the spectrum in @xmath4 band ( see figure [ all_mass_pw_vul_x55z02c10o10_vrijhk_composite ] ) .",
    "the next is v705  cas .",
    "this mmrd point is much ( @xmath323 mag ) brighter than both of the mmrd1 and mmrd2 relations .",
    "the photospheric emission is not as much to make the @xmath311 time longer by a factor of 2.0 ( because @xmath324 ) , as clearly shown in figure [ all_mass_v705_cas_x55z02c10o10_composite ] .",
    "therefore , we attribute the difference in the maximum brightness to the difference in the initial envelope mass . to confirm this , we compared the rise time of uv  1455   flux between pw  vul and v705  cas in figures [ all_mass_pw_vul_x55z02c10o10_vrijhk_composite ] and [ all_mass_v705_cas_x55z02c10o10_composite ] .",
    "the uv  1455   flux had already risen at the optical maximum in pw  vul while it had not yet in v705  cas .",
    "this can be seen more easily in figure [ v705_cas_pw_vul_v_bv_ub_color_curve_logscale ] .",
    "the longer time before uv  1455   peak means that the envelope mass is more massive in v705  cas than in pw  vul .",
    "the more massive initial envelope mass makes the brighter optical maximum of v705  cas .",
    "thus , it locates above the blue solid line of mmrd1 relation .",
    "the third object is gq  mus .",
    "the mmrd point of this object is also much ( @xmath323  mag ) above both the mmrd1 ( blue solid line ) and mmrd2 ( magenta solid line ) .",
    "gq  mus shows a bump of @xmath0 mag brighter than the model light curve in the very early phase .",
    "this feature is very similar to that of v1500  cyg .",
    "one could suppose that this bump is the origin of the deviation from the blue solid line of mmrd1 relation , but v1500  cyg does not show such a large deviation ( see figure [ max_t3_point_b_scale_pw_vul_no3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we suppose that photospheric emission is the main source of the deviation",
    ". we found , from figure [ all_mass_gq_mus_x35z02c10o20_x55z02c10o10_combine_bb](a ) , that the @xmath311 time of the total flux ( black solid line ) is 2.3 times longer compared with the case of free - free only ( blue solid line ) .",
    "this effect makes the @xmath311 time longer by about @xmath325 .",
    "this corresponds to the increase in the brightness by @xmath326 mag in the mmrd diagram , being roughly consistent with the present position of gq  mus in figure [ max_t3_point_b_scale_pw_vul_no3 ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that gq  mus is above the mmrd relation because of photospheric emission effect .",
    "the remaining objects are static - to - wind transition novae , rr  pic , v5558  sgr , hr  del , and v723  cas .",
    "these mmrd points are also much ( 0.81.2 mag ) above the blue solid line of mmrd1 but hr  del and v723  cas are consistent with the mmrd2 . from figure [ all_mass_v723_cas_x55z02c10o10_composite_m51 ] of v723",
    "cas , we see that the @xmath311 time estimated along our total @xmath4 flux model ( black solid line ) is @xmath327 times longer than the case of free - free only ( blue solid line ) .",
    "note again that our free - free emission model light curves usually follow the averaged mmrd relation of mmrd1 ( kaler & schmidt s law ) .",
    "the photospheric emission effect raises the brightness by @xmath328  mag compared with the mmrd1 ( blue solid line ) , being roughly consistent with the position of v723  cas in figure [ max_t3_point_b_scale_pw_vul_no3 ] .",
    "similarly for hr  del , we obtain , from figure [ all_mass_hr_del_x55z02c10o10_composite_2fig_no2](a ) , a factor of @xmath327 and a raise of @xmath328  mag owing to the photospheric emission effect .",
    "this is also consistent with the position of hr  del in figure [ max_t3_point_b_scale_pw_vul_no3 ] .",
    "v5558  sgr and rr  pic showed much brighter ( @xmath329 mag ) optical maxima than the mmrd1 ( blue solid line ) .",
    "these two novae showed prominent amplitudes of oscillations during the multiple - peak .",
    "we think that these large peaks are related to more massive envelopes compared with those of hr  del and v723  cas .",
    "in fact , the amplitude of multiple - peak is decreasing in v5558  sgr , suggesting reduction of the envelope mass due to mass loss .",
    "the same explanation is possible in rr  pic , whose mmrd point is also 1.2 mag brighter than the mmrd1 relation ( blue solid line ) .",
    "it is interesting to see the position of the recurrent nova rs oph ( red filled star ) and the 1 yr recurrence period m31 nova , m31n2008 - 12a ( red open diamond ) in figure [ max_t3_point_b_scale_pw_vul_no3 ] .",
    "rs  oph locates 1.2 mag below the mmrd1 .",
    "this faintness corresponds to a much smaller envelope mass at optical maximum , suggesting a massive wd and very high mass accretion rate .",
    "this situation is very consistent with the total picture of recurrent novae ; a very massive wd close to the chandrasekhar mass and a high mass accretion rate to the wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this figure",
    ", we adopt @xmath330 and @xmath331 days with the distance of @xmath332 kpc @xcite , absorption of @xmath333 @xcite , @xmath334 @xcite , and @xmath331 days from optical light curve fitting with our free - free model light curves @xcite .",
    "the 1 yr recurrence period m31 nova , m31n2008 - 12a is depicted by a red open diamond .",
    "it is very faint , i.e. , @xmath335 ( maximum in @xmath76-band ) and @xmath336 days ( measured in the @xmath76-band light curve ) , taken from @xcite .",
    "the 1 yr recurrence period is close to the shortest recurrence period of novae , suggesting a very massive wd close to the chandrasekhar mass and a very high accretion rate ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus a very small envelope mass .",
    "these support our conclusion that the peak brightness of a nova depends on the initial envelope mass as well as the wd mass itself .    to summarize , the primary parameter of the mmrd relation is the wd mass and the secondary parameter is the initial envelope mass .",
    "variations in the initial envelope mass is the origin of scatter from the averaged mmrd relation , mmrd1 .",
    "more massive envelopes correspond to the region above the mmrd1 line and less massive envelopes correspond to the region below the mmrd1 line .",

    "the last line in equation ( [ real_timescale_flux ] ) simply means that the model light curve @xmath390 in figure [ all_mass_pw_vul_x55z02c10o10_vrijhk_universal_no2 ] is shifted horizontally by @xmath372 and vertically by @xmath391 to retrieve the absolute magnitude and real timescale .",

    "the obtained values are roughly consistent with the above empirical relations .",
    "the clear trend appearing from figure [ all_mass_pw_vul_x55z02c10o10_vrijhk_absolute_mag ] is that a more massive wd is systematically brighter at maximum ( smaller @xmath310 ; see magenta filled circles near the mark b ) and has a faster decline rate ( smaller @xmath410 or @xmath311 time ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath311 ( or @xmath410 ) and @xmath310 for a nova is usually called `` maximum magnitude vs. rate of decline '' ( mmrd ) relation . here",

    "@xcite pointed out that the main parameter governing the mmrd relation is the wd mass ( represented by the time - scaling factor @xmath367 in figure [ max_t3_point_b_scale_pw_vul_no2 ] ) , the second parameter being the initial envelope mass ( or the mass accretion rate of the wd ) . in turn , the initial envelope mass ( ignition mass ) depends on the mass accretion rate to the wd ( see , e.g. , figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) such that the lower the mass accretion rate is , the larger the envelope mass is .",
    "this simply means that , for the same wd mass , novae are brighter / fainter for lower / higher mass accretion rates .",
    "@xcite clearly showed the dependence of maximum brightness on the initial envelope mass ( see their figures 8 and 15 ) .",
    "we further show fainter examples of maximum brightness , rs  oph and m31n2008 - 12a , both of which are recurrent novae with @xmath427 and @xmath4281 yr recurrence periods , respectively .",
    "we conclude that this second parameter , the initial envelope mass , can reasonably explain the scatter of individual novae from the empirical mmrd relations so far proposed ( see figure 15 of * ? ? ?",
    "the distance modulus of pw  vul can be estimated , in a very different way , from a resemblance between pw  vul and other optically well - observed novae .",
    "@xcite found that nova light curves follow a universal decline law when free - free emission dominates the spectrum in optical and nir regions . using this property",
    ", @xcite found that , if two nova light curves overlap each other after one of the two is squeezed / stretched by a factor of @xmath314 ( @xmath315 ) in the time direction , the brightnesses of the two novae obey the relation of @xmath429 which is the same as equation ( [ simple_final_scaling_flux ] ) . using this property with calibrated nova light curves",
    ", we can estimate the absolute magnitude of a target nova .",

    "<S> we analyzed light curves of seven relatively slower novae , pw  vul , v705  cas , gq  mus , rr  pic , v5558  sgr , hr  del , and v723  cas , based on an optically thick wind theory of nova outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> for fast novae , free - free emission dominates the spectrum in optical bands rather than photospheric emission and nova optical light curves follow the universal decline law . </S>",
    "<S> faster novae blow stronger winds with larger mass loss rates . since the brightness of free - free emission depends directly on the wind mass loss rate , faster </S>",
    "<S> novae show brighter optical maxima . </S>",
    "<S> in slower novae , however , we must take into account photospheric emission because of their lower wind mass loss rates . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated three model light curves of free - free emission , photospheric emission , and the sum of them for various wd masses with various chemical compositions of their envelopes , and fitted reasonably with observational data of optical , near - ir ( nir ) , and uv bands . from light curve fittings of the seven novae </S>",
    "<S> , we estimated their absolute magnitudes , distances , and wd masses . in pw  vul and v705  cas , free - free emission still dominates the spectrum in the optical and nir bands . in the very slow novae , rr  pic , v5558  sgr , hr  del , and v723  cas , photospheric emission dominates the spectrum rather than free - free emission , which makes a deviation from the universal decline law </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed that the absolute brightnesses of our model light curves are consistent with the distance moduli of four classical novae with known distances ( gk  per , v603  aql , rr  pic , and dq  her ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also discussed the reason why the very slow novae are about @xmath0 mag brighter than the proposed maximum magnitude vs. rate of decline relation . </S>"
