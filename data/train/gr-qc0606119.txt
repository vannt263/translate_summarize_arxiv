    "recent years have witnessed a large amount of interest in higher - dimensional cosmologies where the extra dimensions are noncompact .",
    "a popular example is the so - called randall - sundrum brane world ( bw ) scenario@xcite .",
    "particular interest revolves around solutions which are not only ricci flat , but also riemann flat ( @xmath0 ) , where the vanishing of the riemann tensor means that we are considering the analog of the minkowsky metric in 5d .",
    "an achievement of this theory is that all the matter fields in 4d can arise from a higher - dimensional vacuum .",
    "one starts with the vacuum einstein field equations in 5d and dimensional reduction of the ricci tensor leads to an effective 4d energy - momentum tensor@xcite .",

    "bw and i m theories may appear different , but their equivalence has been recently shown by ponce de leon@xcite .    the potential energy of the scalar field and/or the presence of a variable cosmological term could drive inflation , resolving puzzles such as the monopole , horizon and flatness problems@xcite .",
    "the variable cosmological term has also been mentioned as a possible solution to the cosmological `` constant '' problem@xcite and , most recently , as a candidate for the dark matter ( or quintessence ) making up most of the universe@xcite .",
