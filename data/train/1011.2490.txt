    "@xcite have recently shown how to realize a tunable effective spin - half model with ultracold two - component atoms in an optical lattice via superexchange , thus allowing , in principle , the experimental study of quantum magnetism in the controllable atomic systems , but the low temperature scale set by the superexchange is currently a barrier to this program .",
    "very recent experimental achievement of ultracold gases of dipolar molecules @xcite has opened up additional exciting possibilities for realizing designer hamiltonians due to the extended range of the induced electric dipole - dipole interaction which decays as @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite would severely limit the stability of states with multiply occupied sites .    in this work",

    "note that in 1d the hardcore constraint in conjunction with number conservation breaks the hilbert space up into disconnected sectors since a given sequence of @xmath8 and @xmath9 fermions can not evolve to a different sequence , although the locations of the empty sites may change .",
    "since the on - site hilbert space is spanned by three states ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , empty ) , we pursue a mapping to a spin - one description , as in refs .",

    "we now show how the interactions can be tuned . in the following we keep only nearest neighbor interactions and take the lattice to be one - dimensional , but",

    "furthermore , the string correlator along @xmath70 no longer displays true long range order , but decays with a power law",

    "the mapping from hard - core spin - half fermions to a spin - one model provides a suggestive and intuitive language to describe the system , but it is difficult to explain the behavior of the hl phase in this language .",
    "however , given an underlying string - type spin order , one can alternatively make a mapping from the original hardcore spin - half fermions to a spinless luttinger liquid with a prescription for how to access the spin information from the density , similar to the approach in ref .",

    "restricting ourselves to the physically relevant string ordered subspace , eliminating the spin information leaves a spinless attractive fermion system .",
    "any eigenstate of the spinful hamiltonian , @xmath75 , in this subspace can be written as a superposition @xmath76 , where the two terms correspond to the two possible realizations of string order , _",
    "i.e. _ , choice of the first fermion s spin .",
    "this choice uniquely determines all the spins , so the state separates into spin and density parts , and @xmath77 is an eigenstate of the spinless attractive fermion hamiltonian , @xmath78 .",
    "( note that the interaction in the string ordered subspace is independent of the two spin states . )",
    "if the lattice is packed , the two string ordered sectors are disconnected and all eigenstates are doubly degenerate . for @xmath79 , though , the hopping term , @xmath80 , connects states @xmath81 and @xmath82 by taking a particle from site @xmath83 to site @xmath84 ( or vice versa ) via the periodic ( or more generally , phase twisted ) boundary conditions . in this case the symmetry of the hamiltonian requires the eigenstates to have definite parity , @xmath85 , under  time reversal \" ( tr ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath86 , so the eigenstates are unique .",

    "consistency for hops between sites @xmath83 and @xmath84 requires @xmath88 , where @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) is the boundary phase twist of the spinful ( effective spinless ) system .",
    "so for tr even ( odd ) states , we may describe the spinful state in terms of an effective spinless state under boundary conditions with the same ( an additional @xmath91 ) phase twist .",
    "the meaning of this is readily seen in that @xmath92 hops are sufficient to cycle the density around the ring back into its original configuration , but the resulting spin part of the wavefunction is time - reversed .",
    "thus , tr odd states acquire a @xmath91 phase after one circuit .",
    "one interesting ramification is that , if an effective flux is introduced , the ground state energy as a function of flux has half the period of a spinless system , as illustrated in fig .",

    "we have checked that the numerical calculations give consistent results for @xmath95 when comparing the various correlation functions .",
    "also , the exponential decay of @xmath96 is readily understood since one can not propagate one particle past another without destroying the string order , so the correlation function must exponentially decay with a characteristic length set by the average interparticle spacing .      from the above arguments it is clear that under open boundary conditions , the ground state must always be doubly degenerate , as also shown in ref .",
    "however , for periodic boundary conditions it may be unique . to link the double degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum to this topological degeneracy ,",
    "consider the reduced density matrix for a block of sites , @xmath97 , obtained by tracing over the remaining subsystem , @xmath98 , @xmath99 since a given number of particles and realization of string order in @xmath98 specifies the number and realization of string order in @xmath97 , the above decomposes as @xmath100 in the nondegenerate case , the states have definite tr parity , so @xmath101 and the entanglement spectrum is exactly doubly degenerate .",
    "to probe the hl phase experimentally , one should initialize the system in the @xmath37 string ordered sector ( _ e.g. _ , by starting with a 3d lattice and adiabatically turning on a strong cylindrical trap ) .",

    "although finite temperature introduces an exponentially decaying envelope to the gapless correlation functions , at sufficiently low temperature the algebraic decay is dominant up to some thermal length .    the entanglement spectrum and string correlators are not as directly accessible",

    "the hard core constraint together with the ising constraint on the spins leads to an important conserved quantity in the hamiltonian given by the sequence @xmath121 i.e the spin sequence is conserved modulo cyclic permutations @xmath122 .",

    "all terms in the hamiltonians under consideration are diagonal ( and therefore like a potential energy term ) other than the hopping term .",
    "the composite vector @xmath135 is taken to be in a bounded region such that @xmath136 .",
    "the hopping terms @xmath137 for most of the points allow only hopping inside this bounded region .",
    "because of periodic boundary conditions , the hopping @xmath137 also connects the boundary points with @xmath138 such that @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "we refer to these hyperplanes as @xmath141 and @xmath142 respectively in parameter space .",
    "the schrodinger equation takes the abstract form @xmath143 where @xmath144 , @xmath137 are the allowed nearest neighbor hopping operators in the multi - dimensional space and @xmath145 is the energy eigenvalue .",
    "since the spin ordering of each state is alternating , the potential energy is independent of the spin part i.e. @xmath146 .",
    "although the kinetic energy can mix the two spin sequences , it is also symmetric , so for @xmath147 the eigenstates are nondegenerate and have definite parity under time - reversal .",
