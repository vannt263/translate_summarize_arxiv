    "3.0ex    from heavy ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies one would like to learn , e.g.  how high energy and baryon number densities can be reached in these collisions and to what degree the produced matter is equilibrated . answers to these questions would tell us which regions in the nuclear phase diagram are accessible in nuclear collisions .",
    "it would also show if , and to what extent the quark - gluon phase has been reached in present sps experiments  @xcite .",
    "there are no direct measurements of the achieved energy and baryon number densities and therefore one uses models to extract the information from the experimental data .",
    "one commonly used approach is hydrodynamics @xcite which correlates the initial densities with measured spectra of final particles . by definition",
    ", hydrodynamics assumes local thermal equilibrium in the expanding matter and is therefore unable to answer the question of thermal equilibration .",
    "our main goal in this work is to investigate the scaling of initial energy density in heavy ion collisions as a function of the size of the colliding nuclei at ( nearly ) fixed energy .",
    "therefore we study and compare five different collisions at cern - sps energies , o+au , s+s , s+ag , s+au and pb+pb , using the same parametrization for the initial state . in section [ second ]",
    "we introduce the parametrization of the initial conditions .",
    "section [ third ] discusses the results and in section [ fourth ] conclusions are drawn .",
    "at ultra - relativistic energies nucleus  nucleus collisions are expected to become transparent , meaning that the matter of final particles is produced in a state of _ initial collective motion_. we have not succeeded to reproduce , even qualitatively , the baryon rapidity distributions if we assume that the produced matter is initially completely stopped , commonly referred to as the landau initial conditions . as an example we show in fig .",
    "[ pblandau ] the net - proton distribution in a lead - on - lead collision as obtained by assuming that the matter of the initial fireball is at rest .",
    "the calculation is compared with the measurement of na49  @xcite .",
    "the disagreement between the data and the calculation is , as expected , larger for lighter nuclei .",
    "this indicates that the primary collision stage can not be treated within one fluid hydrodynamics since this would lead to compressed matter at rest .",
    "instead , we start the simulation after the system has equilibrated @xcite . to use this procedure",
    "we need a parametrization of the initial conditions .",
    "little is known about the initial state and a chosen parametrization can be justified only by comparing with the data .",
    "the parameter space of the initial conditions , which give reasonable agreement with data turns out to be large .",
    "partly this results from the freedom in choosing the equation of state .",
    "therefore it is difficult to pin down , e.g.  the initial temperature achieved in a heavy ion collision .    here",
    "we exploit the idea to fix the initial conditions using the local thickness of colliding nuclei .",
    "we parametrize the nuclear stopping locally in the transverse direction in terms of the nuclear thickness function and then constrain the energy density from conservation of energy .",
    "the advantage of this approach , when combined with the geometry of the colliding nuclei , is that fixing of the parameters fixes the initial conditions for all different collisions at the given energy .",
    "it also gives a better basis to compare different collisions and to draw conclusions on the dependence of the initial state on the nuclear size .",
    "the main features of our parametrization of the initial conditions are described in @xcite . here",
    "we summarize the most important ingredients . note that we consider only impact parameter zero collisions i.e.  azimuthal symmetry",
    "is assumed .",
    "one of the difficulties in hydrodynamic simulations is the treatment of the surfaces .",
    "e.g.  in the transverse direction the outer edges never behave hydrodynamically and even in head - on collisions a certain fraction of nucleons never suffer a single collision .",
    "these nucleons are not detected in the experiment and their energy does not contribute to the production of final matter .",
    "to account for this we use effective nuclear sizes , i.e.  we replace the mass numbers of incoming nuclei , @xmath0 and @xmath1 by @xmath2 and fix the geometry in terms of these effective mass numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in fixing the value of @xmath5 , always close to one , we also compensate for the few percent losses of baryon number and energy in our numerical code .",
    "we start out by parametrizing the rapidity distribution of baryons @xmath6 as a sum of projectile and target contribution for symmetric collisions @xcite , @xmath7 ( 1-x_y^2 ) \\ : , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using a variable @xmath8 , the rapidity scaled with @xmath9 , the projectile rapidity in the cm frame .",
    "the factor @xmath10 ensures that the distribution goes to zero at the boundary of the phase space when effects like fermi motion are neglected .",
    "the functional form is motivated by the experimental proton rapidity distributions in @xmath11 + @xmath11 collisions @xcite and the possibility to control the amount of stopping .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are normalization constants .",
    "the main idea of our parametrization is that the above initial distribution is determined locally in transverse plane .",
    "this is implemented by defining the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 as functions of the local nuclear thickness @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the nuclear density for a nucleus of mass number @xmath0 , @xmath19 is the longitudinal and @xmath20 the transverse variable : @xmath21 .",

    "the first motivation for this parametrization is its simplicity .",
    "second , in the case of one collision , i.e.  @xmath34 , the experimental proton rapidity distribution for @xmath33 collisions is recovered @xcite . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the @xmath28 coefficient is negative indicating increasing stopping with growing nuclear thickness , the strength being controlled by @xmath36 .",
    "it is fixed from fits to baryon rapidity spectra in heavy ion collisions and therefore its determination includes the hydrodynamical evolution . changing the hydrodynamical evolution by choosing different initial energy and ( longitudinal ) velocity distributions or equation of state results in different optimal values for @xmath36 . in the analysis presented here",
    "the value @xmath37 adequately reproduces all results .",
    "we would like to emphasize that @xmath38 depends on the transverse coordinate @xmath39 and therefore stopping at the center is different from stopping at the edge .",
    "as an example we plot in fig .",
    "[ inidens ] the baryon density @xmath40 in the cm frame for s+s collision .",
    "one sees clearly the increase in transparency with radius .",
    "this makes the one - fluid hydrodynamical treatment of nucleus - nucleus collisions more realistic .    for the initial local energy distribution",
    "we choose a gaussian form @xmath41 \\ : \\left[1 - ( y / y_{\\rm max})^2 \\right ] \\ : , \\ ] ] where the width @xmath42 and the normalization @xmath43 depend on the transverse coordinate @xmath20 .",
    "the normalization @xmath44 is given by energy conservation and the value @xmath45 is identified with the center - of - mass rapidity of the collision locally in the transverse plane . since our hydrodynamic calculation",
    "is performed in the overall center - of - mass frame of participating nucleons , @xmath46 for zero impact parameter collisions of equal nuclei . for asymmetric collisions",
    "the thickness of target and projectile varies differently with transverse radius @xmath47 and therefore the rapidity of the local cm frame @xmath48 changes in the transverse plane .    in eq .",

    "the constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 are determined from an overall fit to the investigated collision systems with the result @xmath53 , @xmath54 .    so far baryon density and energy density distributions are specified only as functions of velocities . to convert them into spatial distributions we have to specify the velocity field . in the case of the bjorken model @xcite ,",
    "the scaling ansatz for the longitudinal velocity is @xmath55 and initial conditions are usually defined at fixed proper time @xmath56 . since scaling can not hold in a finite system , we have , for numerical convenience , chosen the rapidity @xmath57 instead of velocity @xmath58 to have the linear @xmath19dependence : @xmath59 \\:,\\ ] ] where the proportionality constant @xmath60 depends on the transverse radius @xmath39 @xcite . for small @xmath19",
    "this ansatz can approach the velocity profile of the scaling solution .",
    "the proportionality constant is now @xmath60 instead of @xmath61 of the bjorken model .",
    "we define @xmath62 as a parameter which can be regarded as an equilibration time scale in the same way as @xmath56 in the scaling case .",
    "the initial time @xmath63 is a parameter which is expected to depend on the nuclear size and the collision energy and is adjusted separately to each collision .",
    "as described above , the model is formulated for symmetric collisions in the center - of - mass frame of the collision .",
    "since we are interested in the mass number dependence of the initial state and large part of the available data is for asymmetric collisions , we would like to modify the parametrization ( [ param ] ) to apply to arbitrary collisions , too .",
    "in symmetric zero impact parameter collisions the rapidity shift is the same on the target and the projectile side and @xmath64 for all values of @xmath20 . for asymmetric collisions the target and",
    "the projectile rapidities differ in the overall cm frame of the participating nucleons .",
    "also , since we determine the initial conditions from the nuclear thicknesses locally in the transverse plane , we have to distinguish between the global cm frame and the cm frame for the collision of a row of target nucleons with a row of projectile nucleons at given @xmath47 .",
    "( [ param ] ) is evaluated in this local cm frame with @xmath65 defined using @xmath66 on the projectile side and @xmath67 on the target side @xmath68 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ ; \\times \\ ; ( 1+x_{y,{\\rm t}})(1-x_{y,{\\rm p } } ) \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 on the target ( projectile ) side .",
    "this ensures the important limit that for @xmath70 the system is stopped in the cm frame when we use ( [ paramas ] ) together with  ( [ abc ] ) .",
    "note that the distinction of local and global cm frames is necessary also if the parametrization is used for nonzero impact parameter collisions of equal nuclei .",
    "we also have to modify the stopping parametrization to account for the fact that for a fixed target size the rapidities of the nucleons of a smaller projectile are , on the average , shifted more than those of a bigger projectile and vice versa .",
    "this means that we must include both the target and the projectile thickness functions into the parametrization ( [ abc ] ) . without this modification the average momentum of projectile nucleons after the collision with a target of fixed size would be independent of the projectile size and the total momentum of target and projectile nucleons after the collisions",
    "would not add up to zero in the overall momentum frame . in principle",
    "this needs not to be the case since the mesonic degrees of freedom can balance the momentum but we do not find it plausible that the center of mass of nucleons would appreciable differ from the center of mass of produced mesons .",
    "it turns out that the momentum balance between the colliding nucleons can be approximately satisfied if we replace @xmath30 and @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ abc ] ) with effective values @xmath72 and @xmath73 defined as @xmath74 the factor @xmath75 can be considered as an asymmetry correction for the stopping .",

    "freeze - out occurs when the mean free path of particles is of the same order than the size of the fireball . for the collisions of light nuclei this criterium leads to freeze - out temperatures of @xmath85 mev @xcite . instead of taking contours of constant temperature",

    "[ negrap ] the rapidity distributions of negative particles for the various collisions .",

    "our parametrization ( [ enparameter ] ) which includes only two free parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the expression of the width ( [ cy ] ) reproduces all five measured rapidity spectra of negative particles .",
    "this suggests that ( [ enparameter ] ) could be used for any collision system at sps energies .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that the optimal values for the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eq .",

    "( [ abc ] ) together with the eos is able to account for the larger stopping in a quantitatively satisfactory way as seen from the comparison with preliminary data from na49 @xcite .    in the asymmetric collisions",
    "the net proton rapidity distributions are reproduced only around midrapidity and in the forward region while at target fragmentation region the net proton yields are underestimated considerably .",
    "the reason for this deviation can be understood by considering the geometry of an asymmetric collision .",
    "the initial state of the hydrodynamical calculation is determined by using the cylindrical volume as cut out of the target by the smaller projectile nucleus . however , during the first collisions the projectile nucleons moving through the target acquire transverse momentum , some of them penetrate into the region outside the cylinder and interact further .",
    "similarly some of the produced particles can interact with the nucleons outside the cylinder .",
    "nucleons from these interactions are not included in the hydrodynamic description but are observed experimentally in the target fragmentation region .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that these additional protons will not play any role in the hydrodynamical calculation .",
    "this assumption is supported by the @xmath91 rapidity distributions in fig .",
    "[ nprorap ] which show good agreement between the calculated and measured spectra even in the target fragmentation region .    in fig .",
    "[ negpt ] we show that the measured transverse momentum distributions of negatives and @xmath92 s agree quite well with the calculated spectra except in the case of o+au collisions , where the large low-@xmath93 enhancement can not be reproduced and the calculation exhibits slightly too much flow . for pb+pb the very forward pions are flatter than in the calculation .",
    "the particle density at this edge of the phase space , however , is becoming so small that hydrodynamics with relatively strong longitudinal flow can lead to an artificially large transverse cooling .",
    "thus we should not expect that hydrodynamics can describe the far edges of fragmentation regions well",
    ".    a closer look on the experimental transverse spectra shows that nearly all of them have a small but visible concave shape in @xmath94 which is not reproduced by the calculation .",
    "the calculation gives only the average slope right . we think that the explanation is the too simple freeze - out procedure applied in the calculation .",
    "in fact , in such a small system as created in the nuclear collisions , the last interaction of a final hadron can take place with non - zero probability at any space - time point .",
    "therefore the spectra receive contributions from all temperatures and not only from the assumed freeze - out temperature .",
    "note that the number of particles in the tail of transverse distribution is very small indicating that rare earlier escapes of high@xmath93 particles would not invalidate the hydrodynamic treatment of the bulk of the final matter .",
    "improvements have been suggested @xcite but they are difficult to implement technically .",
    "finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ npropt ] the transverse momentum distribution of heavy particles . in s+s collisions",
    "the net proton distribution is in agreement with the data supporting the assumption of freeze - out at a common transverse flow velocity with pions . for s+ag and s+au",
    "we obtain agreement in the @xmath93-spectra of @xmath91 s . the agreement in the normalization",
    "should be considered accidental .",
    "it is obtained with a freeze - out temperature of @xmath95 mev and assuming full chemical equilibration .",
    "more detailed studies on chemical equilibration indicate higher chemical freeze - out temperatures but not full chemical equilibration of strangeness @xcite . in our calculation the normalization is achieved because the lower freeze - out temperature is compensated by the assumption of full chemical equilibration of @xmath91 s . in the transverse spectrum",
    "the lower freeze - out temperature is balanced by the transverse flow .    for pb+pb collisions",
    "the calculated transverse spectrum of net protons is slightly steeper than the data even at central rapidities if a freeze - out temperature @xmath85 mev is used .",
    "this was already observed in @xcite and is an indication of the freeze - out taking place at lower temperature in the larger pb+pb system .",
    "therefore we redid the calculation with a freeze - out temperature @xmath96 mev as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the result is shown as dotted line in fig .",
    "[ npropt ] .",
    "the agreement for the transverse spectrum of net protons is clearly improved .",
    "the corresponding @xmath97-spectrum of negatives in fig .",
    "[ negpt ] is only slightly modified compared to the freeze - out at @xmath98 mev .",
    "we did a calculation for s+s collisions with @xmath99 mev , too . while the @xmath93 slope of negatives still agrees with the data , that of net - protons , and in particular that of kaons and lambdas , comes out flatter than the data .",
    "we conclude that our calculations support the kinetic estimates for the freeze - out @xcite , especially its dependence on the size of the system",
    ". however , the freeze - out temperatures favoured by the @xmath93-spectra are model dependent since we found that results for pb+pb collisions with @xmath100 mev and @xmath95 mev are close to those with @xmath101 mev and @xmath96 mev .",

    "it turns out that @xmath102 is very similar , @xmath103  @xmath104c , for all collisions from s+s to pb+pb .",
    "however , the sensitivity of final spectra on @xmath102 is not very strong , since the density parametrizations are done in rapidity space . within a variation of @xmath105 fm / c in @xmath102 the fits remain acceptable .    as mentioned already earlier ,",
    "@xmath102 can be considered to give an estimate of the thermalization time . on the other hand",
    "the initial longitudinal extension can be related to the equilibration time for the whole system in the global center - of - mass frame .",
    "the longitudinal extension of all systems is roughly the same and leads to an estimate of a common initial time of around 3 fm / c as counted from the time when the front edges of the nuclei meet to the time when all quanta from primary collisions have formed and reached approximate equilibrium .",
    "the difference compared to @xmath102 arises mainly from the finite thickness of colliding nuclei .",
    "the numbers are consistent with the findings in the three - fluid hydrodynamical studies .",
    "they indicate a pressure equilibration time to be of the order of 1.5 fm / c for pb+pb collisions @xcite at sps energies . in the hydrodynamic treatment , carried out in the center - of - mass system of participating nuclei ,",
    "the initial conditions are specified at global equilibration time of the whole system which , however , does not enter the calculation as an explicit parameter .    in table",

    "we expect the @xmath0-dependence of the initial energy density to lie between the following two crude estimates based on the assumption that @xmath106 is proportional to the number of sources in a nucleus - nucleus collision .",

    "but for pb+pb they favour a somewhat higher value @xmath128 mev while our results favour the lower freeze - out temperature of 120 mev leading to @xmath129 for pb+pb in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we have constructed a model for initial conditions in nucleus - nucleus collisions at cern - sps energies based on the parametrization of baryon stopping by specifying the initial baryon number distribution @xmath6 .",
    "the parametrization is expressed as a function of the local thickness of colliding nuclei in the transverse plane .",
    "the major advantages of this approach are that it reduces the arbitrariness of choosing the initial conditions for different collisions and allows a proper treatment of transverse geometry of the colliding nuclei .",
    "we think that this is an important improvement compared to the earlier approaches @xcite where different collisions are not related and the longitudinal dependence is treated equally both on the symmetry axis at @xmath130 and at the outer edge ( @xmath131 ) of the collision system .",
    "the success in reproducing the single particle spectra for various collisions gives confidence that the deduced mass number dependencies of the initial and final state quantities are reasonable .",
    "an important example is the scaling of the the initial energy density .",
    "even though the observed dependence of hadron multiplicity on the mass number is close to linear , corresponding to the @xmath132 scaling for the density , the initial energy density grows faster as shown in fig .",
    "[ sl ] reflecting the effect of hydrodynamic expansion on the final transverse energy flow . for the s+au and pb+pb collisions",
    "we obtain a ratio @xmath133 which , in addition to the volume effects , could be related to the observed features of j/@xmath134 suppression @xcite . in our parametrization",
    "the center of the fireball starts out in the quark - gluon plasma phase for all considered collisions .",
    "however , we consider the scaling more reliable than the absolute value of energy density which is more sensitive on the details of the parametrization .",
    "one should also note that in smaller systems the high density occurs only for a short time interval in a small fraction of the total volume .    for further improvements in determining the initial conditions of nuclear collisions a better understanding of the freeze - out physics",
    "is needed , e.g.  to allow emission from the whole space ",
    "time volume  @xcite . for a proper treatment also a sequential freeze - out for various particle species",
    "should be implemented @xcite .",
    "since the particle ratios are a result of the whole evolution and not only of the freeze - out conditions this would help more directly in pinning down the initial state in nuclear collisions .",
