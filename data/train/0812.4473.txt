    "it is well known that the merging of galaxies with central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) is an important process for growth of the smbh mass .",
    "recent studies , however , have shown the possibility that the smbhs can not coalesce within the hubble time in the merger remnant @xcite .",
    "@xcite have examined the merging process of galaxies with central smbhs with masses of @xmath1 .",
    "they estimate the timescale of coalescence of smbhs in the merger remnant and show that the timescale is more than the hubble time .",
    "they describe the reason for this as follows : smbhs sink into the center in the merger remnant because of the dynamical friction from field stars . during this process",
    ", the field stars near the center are scattered by smbhs and the number of the field stars decreases .",
    "the loss cone depletion occurs because of the scattering . in this case ,",
    "dynamical friction force on the smbhs becomes very weak .",
    "then , it is difficult for the smbh binary to shrink to a small distance enough to emit significant gravitational waves in the final coalescence stage of smbhs .",
    "@xcite have studied the dynamical evolution of a smbh binary , that each mass of the smbh is @xmath2 , in the stellar system by performing high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "their results have shown that the hardening timescale of the binary strongly depends on the relaxation time of the host galaxy as predicted by @xcite .",
    "these results have confirmed the prediction that the smbh binary can not coalesce within the hubble time by only gravitational interactions between smbhs and field stars of the host galaxy since the relaxation time in a galactic stellar system is larger than the hubble time .",
    "this difficulty in the coalescence process of smbhs is called the `` loss cone depletion problem '' .    to resolve the loss cone depletion problem ,",
    "several ideas to accelerate the orbital decay of the binary are proposed .",
    "gaseous torque in a massive gas disk is proposed in the wet merger cases @xcite . in the dry merger cases which are observed in neaby galaxies @xcite , the effect of a galactic triaxial potential @xcite ,",
    "large mass ratio between a smbh and intermediate - mass bh @xcite , and a triple smbh system @xcite have been proposed . in the triple smbh system ,",
    "two smbhs coalesce through the three body instability and the kozai mechanism and the coalescence possibility is roughly @xmath3 % @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have proposed the role of massive perturbers . in their analytical studies , it has been shown the possibility that the massive perturbers of giant molecular clouds or molecular gas clumps accelerate the relaxation of stars in the galactic central region and , as a result , trigger the rapid coalescence of the smbh binary .",
    "they pointed out the importance of three body interactions between the smbh binary and stars .",
    "these ideas have possibility to lead to the coalescence of two smbhs within the hubble time , if some suitable conditions are realized .    in this paper , in order to resolve the loss cone depletion problem , we propose a new scenario that a minor merger triggers the rapid shrink of the smbh binary .",
    "similar idea was studied by @xcite and @xcite our scenario is as follows : if a dwarf galaxy is compact enough , it can come close to the galactic center , and then , stellar orbits of the host galaxy are highly disturbed by the dwarf galaxy . in this case , many stars will be supplied into the loss cone . moreover , if the dwarf galaxy is not destroyed before it closes enough to the central region , stars of the dwarf galaxy will be also supplied into the loss cone . in this way , gravitational interactions of the smbh binary with these stars become effective and the hardening rate of the smbh binary will become high . as a result , the binary can close to the unstable separation at which significant gravitational wave is emitted .    to demonstrate our scenario , we perform highly accurate @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we show that a merging of a dwarf galaxy is an effective process to decrease the binding energy of a smbh binary and trigger the rapid shrink of the binary , if the core of the dwarf galaxy is not destroyed by the tidal force and comes very close to the galactic central region .",
    "we present our simulation model and method in  [ simulation ] , numerical results in  [ results ] , and discussions in  [ discussion ] .",
    "the simulation process is described in the following .",
    "firstly , we make a simulation of a host galaxy with a smbh binary without a minor merger .",
    "then , we add a dwarf galaxy to the host galaxy after the loss cone depletion is established , that is , evolution of the semi - major axis of the binary becomes very slow .",
    "we describe the model of a host galaxy with a smbh binary before a minor merger . for the stellar distribution of the host galaxy",

    "the rate of the shrink becomes similar to the case without a minor merger after about @xmath81 .",
    "the high hardening rate and the rapid shrink of the semi - major axis are caused by following process : the core of the dwarf galaxy passes through the central region of the host galaxy without the destruction by the tidal force , since the density of the core is higher than that of the host galaxy . when the core is close to the center of the host galaxy , it perturbs the gravitational potential of the host galaxy .",
