    "the size of this shift at @xmath157 could give us an indirect way to measure the running of the coupling . at @xmath157 , we know that @xmath159 , which gives the relation @xmath160 the difficulty in determining @xmath161 and @xmath162 , as well as the relatively large uncertainty on the measurement of @xmath150 , means that although in principle this would be a way to measure @xmath163 , in practice it is not feasible with our data .",
    "the difference between the measured critical bare masses , and the values predicted by the interpolation function , are very small as shown in fig .",
