    "one of the most prominent star forming regions ( sfrs ) in orion , albeit not very well studied , is the head of orion , the lambda orionis star forming region ( hereafter losfr ) .",
    "this area , about 50 sq.deg .",
    ", is dominated by the o8 iii star @xmath3@xmath4 orionis .",
    "this star is located at the center of a ring of dust and molecules , which encloses the s264 hii region , a large number of iras sources , the ldb1588 & ldn1603 and barnard 30 and barnard 35 ( b30 & b35 ) dark clouds , and the lambda orionis ( also called collinder 69 ) cluster which is located just around the central star .",
    "figure 1 shows this region , and includes the emission at 100 @xmath5 ( from iras ) and the distribution of stars of b spectral type .",
    "several groups have focused on different aspects of the losfr , such as the photometric properties of the high mass members ( murdin & penston 1977 ) , a h@xmath1 survey ( duerr , imhoff & lada 1982 ) , the analysis of the iras data ( zhang et al . 1989 ) and a photometric and spectroscopic search ( dolan & mathieu 1999 , 2001 , 2002 , d&m hereafter ) .",
    "all this wealth of data has shown that young stars are clustered around the central part of the losfr ( the col  69 cluster ) and the dark clouds b30 & b35 , whereas a large number of iras sources are associated to the much denser clouds ldn1588 & ldn1603 .",
    "the distance to this region is in between 380@xmath230 pc , as derived by hipparcos , and 450@xmath250 pc ( d&m ) .",
    "d&m also derived an age of about 6 myr , which correspond to the turn - off age for the massive stars ( 4 myr in the case of murdin & penston 1977 ) .",
    "the region is also characterized by the low reddening in the central area , e@xmath6=0.12 ( diplas & savage 1994 ) .",

    "the diagram also includes two horizontal segments ( red , long - dashed lines ) , which corresponds to an ad hoc and widely used criteria to discriminate between accretion and non - accreting stars in sfrs .",
    "the red , dotted line is the accretion criterion proposed by barrado y navascus & martn ( 2003 ) , which is based on the saturation of the chromospheric activity observed in young open clusters ( 30 - 125 myr ) , which appears at log \\{lum(halpha)/lum(bol)}=@xmath213.3 dex .",
    "based on this criterion , we have classified the the three samples analyzed in this paper ( our own faint objects associated to col  69 purple , solid circles , the d&m stars related to col  69 blue , solid circles , and the d&m stars related to either b30 or b35 green crosses ) , into accretion and non - accreting objects . in the first case , we have over - plotted a large , open circle . this classification has been shown in figures 3 - 8 .",
    "the comparison between these three samples ( actually two : the objects related to col  69 , shown as purple and blue solid circles ; and those related to b30 or b35 , shown as green crosses ) indicates that the fraction of accreting objects is very different in each group ( a result already pointed out by d&m ) . in any case ,",
    "the activity , coming from accretion or from the chromosphere , is much larger in b30 & b35 than in col  69 .",
    "equivalent width , see previous figure ) for different star forming regions and young clusters ( red solid circles ) .",
    "the average trend between the fraction and the age is represented with a red thick , solid line .",
    "the magenta , dashed lines correspond to the values for b30 & b35 , ]      we have compared the h@xmath1 properties of col  69 and b30/b35 with other sfrs and very young open clusters .",
    "to do so , we have computed the ratio of stars having w(h@xmath1 ) above the saturation criterion with the total number of members with known h@xmath1 .",
    "figure 12 shows the results , and includes data from orion , chamaeleon i , taurus , sigma orionis , upper scorpius and the tw hydrae association ( see details and references in barrado y navascus & martn 2003 and barrado y navascus , mohanty and jayawardhana 2005 , in preparation ) . as far as we know , there is no accurate age estimate for b30 & b35 , but the clear trend observed in the other associations suggests that they are about 3 myr , younger than the age estimated by d&m for col  69 .",
    "however , the fraction of accreting stars of col  69 ( or the fraction of very active members ) is much lower than expected , indicating that either col  69 is much older than previously thought ( but the star @xmath3@xmath4 orionis can not be older than about 7 myr , since with a mass around 25 myr would have exploded as a supernova ) , or some event has removed the disks around the classical ttauri stars belonging to the association .",
    "the strong wind and uv flux from @xmath3@xmath4 orionis ( o8 iii spectral type ) might have played this role , at least in the case of the members close to the central star . or d&m might have hit the answer when they suggested that a supernova , more massive than @xmath3@xmath4 orionis , went off in col  69 , inducing the star formation in b30 & b35 ( i.e. , they have to be younger that col  69 ) , and just initiated the process in ldn1588 and ldn1603 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "a third possibility would be that @xmath3@xmath4 orionis is not related to col  69 , which is in unlikely based on the measured distances and overall properties .",

    "moreover , it can be used as an independent age indicator .",
    "the theoretical models predict that no lithium depletion takes place at any mass during the first few million years ( @xmath203 myr , see dantona & mazzitelli 1994 , 1997 ; baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ; siess et al .",
    "after that , a fast depletion takes places , especially for early m stars .",
    "this property has been used to determine , in a very accurate way , the age of ic2391 , the alpha persei cluster , and the pleiades ( stauffer et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; barrado y navascus et al .",
    "1999 , 2004b ) .",
    "however , for younger ages , lithium becomes a less accurate age indicator because the lithium depletion chasm becomes shallower .",
    "more physically , lithium depletion becomes much harder to model because the stars involved develop radiative cores , and the amount of lithium observed in the photosphere depends critically on the exact point in the evolution of the star when the radiative core develops and on any mechanism which may mix matter across the core / envelope boundary ( see jeffries 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , activity and spottedness may affect the ability to accurately infer the effective temperature of the star and may affect the observed lithium equivalent width , making derivation of a lithium abundance subject to error ( barrado y navascus et al .",

    "the scatter of the w(li ) is very large , and we can not see any trend with accretion ( large open circles ) , induced by the veiling of the spectrum .",
    "however , it seems that the upper limit for b30 & b35 is systematically larger ( about 0.1  ) than in the case of col  69 .",
    "might this indicate an enrichment of the material used to built up the members of these two clouds ?",
    "the alternative would be that some depletion which seems not to depend on the spectral type has already occurred in col  69 .",
    "moreover , the w(li ) distribution does not follow the lithium depletion isochrones either , but they impose an upper limit to the age of about 20 myr , which is not very helpful in any case . models by dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 , 1997 ) or siess et al .",

    "( 1992 ) , the star @xmath3@xmath4 orionis , with a mass close to 25 @xmath0 , is about 6 myr . the models impose a maximum age of 7 myr , since it would have become a supernova .",

    "one of our goals is to derived the initial mass function ( imf ) in different agglomerates of the losfr ( b30 & b35 , col  69 , etc ) , and to establish the effect of the different environmental conditions .",
    "so far , we have been able to derive the imf for col  69 .",

    ", we have used a subsample of the col  69 members from our survey with cfht/12k which have been classified as probable and possible members . for the middle range of masses , we have used the d&m data which is located in the same projected area of the sky than our cfht/12k data . finally , in order to extend the lf to the upper mass end , we have included the o , b , a and f stars listed in murdin & penston ( 1997 ) , after removing some of them , which might not be cluster members because of their location in cmds .",
    "additionally , we have included an a7 star taken from simbad ( hde244927 ) , which might be a member based on its photometric characteristics ( the tycho parallax does not agree with membership , but errors are quite large ) .    the lf is illustrated in figure 15 .",
    "the bolometric magnitudes were derived in different ways : for the murdin & penston ( 1977 ) data , we used the v magnitude , the cluster distance modulus and the bolometric corrections by schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) , which depend on the spectral type . in the case of the d&m and cfht/12k datasets , we derived the bolometric magnitudes from the @xmath9 magnitude , the cluster distance modulus , and the bolometric corrections by comern et al .",

    "the black , dotted vertical segment distinguishes between the stellar and substellar domain .",
    "the dip at about m(bol)=2 mag is an artifact due to the lack of completeness for f stars .",
    "we have derived an imf for the low mass stars and brown dwarfs based on the d&m and cfht/12k dataset .",

    "regardless the high mass end of the imf , the slope of the imf has an index of @xmath1=+2.27@xmath20.08 ( 200.8 @xmath0 ) , whereas the value is much smaller for lower masses , @xmath1=+0.73@xmath20.05 ( 0.8 - 0.02 @xmath0 ) .",
    "the overall trend is very similar to the more massive and older m35 cluster ( barrado y navascus et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "we have also compared the col  69 imf with the pleiades and the young disk population , in log - form .",
    "they are depicted in figure 18 , as blue , dashed - red and solid green , respectively . in order to computed the last two mass functions , we have used the expression by chabrier ( 2003 ) :    @xmath27    where @xmath28=0.25 and 0.20 , and @xmath29=0.52 and 0.55 , for the pleiades and the young disk population ( after moraux et al .",
    "2003 and chabrier 2004 , respectively ) .",
    "as can be seen , these imfs are very similar , except for the fact that col  69 is not complete for some mass ranges , and the pleiades , due to its age ( about 125 myr ) , does not contain massive stars .",
    "we are conducting an ambitious study of the star formation and the properties of the losfr , a wide area which includes several dark clouds and clusters .",
    "in particular , we have collected deep optical photometry , low- and medium resolution spectroscopy , and mined the 2mass database to select a sample of bona fide members of the col  69 cluster , which is associated to the star @xmath3@xmath4 orionis , located in the center of the losfr . with this sample and previously , brighter data , we have been able to derive the luminosity and initial mass functions of the col  69 cluster , in the mass range 50 - 0.02 @xmath0 .",
    "two different behaviors are evident , with a turning point about 0.8 @xmath0 .",
    "the high mass stars follow a pattern similar to a salpeter s index , whereas low mass stars and brown dwarfs have a much shallower index . in any case",
    ", the imf keeps growing well within the substellar domain ( although this is not the case for the lf ) . additionally , the imf , in a log - form , is very similar to the pleiades and the young disk population .",
    "on the other hand , we have also studied the properties of the col  69 members ( h@xmath1 emission , lithium equivalent width , cmds and ccds , hr diagram ) .",
    "we have been able to derive an age for the cluster 5@xmath22 myr . moreover ,",
    "when comparing these data with members of the b30 & b35 dark clouds , we have inferred that these two associations have a much larger population of classical ttauri stars ( both from the ccd and the distribution of the h@xmath1 emission of their members ) , are much younger ( with an age of about 3 myr ) and have a similar distribution of the lithium equivalent width for the k5-m5 members .",
