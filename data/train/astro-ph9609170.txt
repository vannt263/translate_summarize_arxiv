    "the field of cmb anisotropies has become one of the main testing grounds for the theories of structure formation and early universe . since the first detection by cobe satellite @xcite",
    "there have been several new detections on smaller angular scales ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "there is hope that future experiments such as map @xcite and cobras / samba @xcite will accurately measure the anisotropies over the whole sky with a fraction of a degree angular resolution , which will help to determine several cosmological parameters with an unprecedented accuracy @xcite .",
    "not all of the cosmological parameters can be accurately determined by the cmb temperature measurements . on large angular scales",
    "cosmic variance ( finite number of multipole moments on the sky ) limits our ability to extract useful information from the observational data . if a certain parameter only shows its signature on large angular scales then the accuracy with which it can be determined is limited .",
    "for example , contribution from primordial gravity waves , if present , will only be important on large angular scales . because both scalar and tensor modes contribute to the temperature anisotropy one can not accurately separate them if only a small number of independent realizations ( multipoles ) contain a significant contribution from tensor modes .",
    "similarly , reionization tends to uniformly suppress the temperature anisotropies for all but the lowest multipole moments and is thus almost degenerate with the amplitude @xcite .",
    "it is clear from previous discussion that additional information will be needed to constrain some of the cosmological parameters .",
    "while the epoch of reionization could in principle be determined through the high redshift observations , primordial gravity waves can only be detected at present from cmb observations .",
    "it has been long recognized that there is additional information present in the cmb data in the form of linear polarization @xcite .",
    "polarization could be particularly useful for constraining the epoch and degree of reionization because the amplitude is significantly increased and has a characteristic signature @xcite .",
    "recently it was also shown that density perturbations ( scalar modes ) do not contribute to polarization for a certain combination of stokes parameters , in contrast with the primordial gravity waves @xcite , which can therefore in principle be detected even for very small amplitudes .",
    "polarization information which will potentially become available with the next generation of experiments will thus provide significant additional information that will help to constrain the underlying cosmological model .",
    "previous work on polarization has been restricted to the small scale limit ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation functions and corresponding power spectra were calculated for the stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters , which are defined with respect to a fixed coordinate system in the sky .",
    "while such a coordinate system is well defined over a small patch in the sky , it becomes ambiguous once the whole sky is considered because one can not define a rotationally invariant orthogonal basis on a sphere .",
    "note that this is not problematic if one is only considering cross - correlation function between polarization and temperature @xcite , where one can fix @xmath1 or @xmath2 at a given point and average over temperature , which is rotationally invariant .",
    "however , if one wants to analyze the auto - correlation function of polarization or perform directly the power spectrum analysis on the data ( which , as argued in @xcite , is more efficient in terms of extracting the signal from the data ) then a more general analysis of polarization is required .",
    "a related problem is the calculation of rotationally invariant power spectrum .",
    "although it is relatively simple to calculate @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the coordinate system where the wavevector describing the perturbation is aligned with the @xmath3 axis , superposition of the different modes becomes complicated because @xmath1 and @xmath2 have to be rotated to a common frame before the superposition can be done . only in the small scale limit",
    "can this rotation be simply expressed @xcite , so that the power spectra can be calculated . however , as argued above , this is not the regime where polarization can make most significant impact in breaking the parameter degeneracies caused by cosmic variance . a more general method that would allow to analyze polarization over the whole sky",
    "has been lacking so - far .",
    "in this paper we present a complete all - sky analysis of polarization and its corresponding power spectra . in section ",
    "2 we expand polarization in the sky in spin - weighted harmonics @xcite , which form a complete and orthonormal system of tensor functions on the sphere .",
    "recently , an alternative expansion in tensor harmonics has been presented @xcite .",
    "our approach differs both in the way we expand polarization on a sphere and in the way we solve for the theoretical power spectra .",
    "we use the line of sight integral solution of the photon boltzmann equation @xcite to obtain the correct expressions for the polarization - polarization and temperature - polarization power spectra both for scalar (  3 ) and tensor (  4 ) modes .",
    "in contrast with previous work the expressions presented here are valid for any angular scale and in  5 we show how they reduce to the corresponding small scale expressions . in section",
    " 6 we discuss how to generate and analyze all - sky maps of polarization and what is the accuracy with which one can reconstruct the various power spectra when cosmic variance and noise are included .",
    "this is followed by discussion and conclusions in  7 .",
    "for completeness we review in appendix the basic properties of spin - weighted functions .",
    "all the calculations in this paper are restricted to a flat geometry .",
    "the cmb radiation field is characterized by a @xmath4 intensity tensor @xmath5 .",
    "the stokes parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are defined as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while the temperature anisotropy is given by @xmath8 . in principle",
    "the fourth stokes parameter @xmath9 that describes circular polarization would also be needed , but in cosmology it can be ignored because it can not be generated through thomson scattering . while the temperature is invariant under a right handed rotation in the plane perpendicular to direction @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 transform under rotation by an angle @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this means we can construct two quantities from the stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters that have a definite value of spin ( see appendix for a review of spin - weighted functions and their properties ) , @xmath15 we may therefore expand each of the quantities in the appropriate spin - weighted basis @xmath16 @xmath1 and @xmath2 are defined at a given direction @xmath17 with respect to the spherical coordinate system @xmath18 . using the first equation in ( [ propys ] ) one can show that the expansion coefficients for the polarization variables satisfy @xmath19 . for temperature the relation is @xmath20 .",
    "the main difficulty when computing the power spectrum of polarization in the past originated in the fact that the stokes parameters are not invariant under rotations in the plane perpendicular to @xmath10 .",
    "while @xmath1 and @xmath2 are easily calculated in a coordinate system where the wavevector @xmath21 is parallel to @xmath22 , the superposition of the different modes is complicated by the behaviour of @xmath1 and @xmath2 under rotations ( equation [ qutrans ] ) . for each wavevector @xmath21 and direction on the sky @xmath10 one has to rotate the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters from the @xmath23 and @xmath10 dependent basis into a fixed basis on the sky . only in the small scale limit is this process well defined , which is why this approximation has always been assumed in previous work @xcite .",
    "however , one can use the spin raising and lowering operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 defined in appendix to obtain spin zero quantities .",

    "the agreement is worse and there are notable discrepancies between the two even at @xmath146 .",
    "we conclude that although the small scale expressions for the power spectrum can provide a good approximation in certain models , there is no reason to use these instead of the exact expressions .",
    "the exact integral solution for the power spectrum requires no additional computational expense compared to the small scale approximation and it should be used whenever accurate theoretical predictions are required .",
    "in this section we discuss issues related to simulating and analyzing all - sky polarization and temperature maps . this should be specially useful for future satellite missions @xcite , which will measure temperature anisotropies and polarization over the whole sky with a high angular resolution .",
    "such an all - sky analysis will be of particular importance if reionization and tensor fluctuations are important , in which case polarization will give useful information on large angular scales , where fourier analysis ( i.e. division of the sky into locally flat patches ) is not possible .",
    "in addition , it is important to know how to simulate an all - sky map which preserves proper correlations between neighboring patches of the sky and with which small scale analysis can be tested for possible biases .    to make an all - sky map we need to generate the multipole moments @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "this can be done by a generalization of the method given in @xcite . for each",

    "once @xmath148 and @xmath149 are generated we can form their linear combinations @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which are equal in the scalar case . finally , to make a map of @xmath160 and @xmath161 in the sky we perform the sum in equation ( [ pexpansion ] ) , using the explicit form of spin - weighted harmonics @xmath162 ( equation [ expl ] ) .",

    "once we have the multipole moments we can construct various power spectrum estimators and analyze their variances . in the case of full sky coverage one may generalize the approach in @xcite to estimate the variance in the power spectrum estimator in the presence of noise .",

    "note that the theoretical analysis is more complicated if all four power spectrum estimators are used to deduce the underlying cosmological model .",
    "for example , to test the sensitivity of the spectrum on the underlying parameter one uses the fisher information matrix approach @xcite .",
    "if only temperature information is given then for each @xmath42 a derivative of the temperature spectrum with respect to the parameter under investigation is computed and this information is then summed over all @xmath42 weighted by @xmath181 . in the more general case discussed here instead of a single derivative we have a vector of four derivatives and the weighting is given by the inverse of the covariance matrix , @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the fisher information or curvature matrix , @xmath184 is the inverse of the covariance matrix , @xmath185 are the cosmological parameters one would like to estimate and @xmath186 stands for @xmath187 . for each @xmath42 one",

    "we show that one can define rotationally invariant electric and magnetic - type parity fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 from the usual @xmath1 and @xmath2 stokes parameters .",
    "a complete statistical characterization of cmb anisotropies requires four correlation functions , the auto - correlations of @xmath34 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the cross - correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath34 .",
    "the pseudo - scalar nature of @xmath33 makes its cross - correlation with @xmath34 and @xmath32 vanish . for scalar modes",
    "@xmath33 field vanishes",
    ".    intuitive understanding of these results can be obtained by considering polarization created by each plane wave given by direction @xmath23 .",
    "photon propagation can be described by scattering through a plane - parallel medium .",
    "the cross - section only depends on the angle between photon direction @xmath189 and @xmath23 , so for a local coordinate system oriented in this direction only @xmath1 stokes parameter will be generated , while @xmath2 will vanish by symmetry arguments @xcite . in the real universe one has to consider a superposition of plane waves so this property does not hold in real space .",
    "however , by performing the analog of a plane wave expansion on the sphere this property becomes valid again and leads to the vanishing of @xmath33 in the scalar case .",
    "for tensor perturbations this is not true even in this @xmath23 dependent frame , because each plane wave consists of two different independent `` polarization '' states , which depend not only on the direction of plane wave , but also on the azimuthal angle perpendicular to @xmath23 .",
    "the symmetry above is thus explicitly broken . both @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are generated in this frame and , equivalently , both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are generated in general .    combining the formalism of spin - weighted functions and the line of sight solution of the boltzmann equation we obtained the exact expressions for the power spectra both for scalar and tensor modes .",
    "we present their numerical evaluations for a representative set of models .",
    "a numerical implementation of the solution is publicly available and can be obtained from the authors @xcite .",
    "we also compared the exact solutions to their analogs in the small scale approximation obtained previously .",
    "while the latter are accurate for all but the largest angular scales , the simple form of the exact solution suggests that the small scale approximation should be replaced with the exact solution for all calculations .",
    "if both scalars and tensors are contributing to a particular combination then the power spectrum for that combination is obtained by adding the individual contributions .",
    "cross - correlation terms between different types of perturbations vanish after the integration over azimuthal angle @xmath190 both for the temperature and for the @xmath32 and @xmath33 polarization , as can be seen from equations ( [ tiles ] ) and ( [ tebt ] ) .",
    "this result holds even for the defect models , where the same source generates scalar , vector and tensor perturbations .    in summary",
    ", future cmb satellite missions will produce all - sky maps of polarization and these maps will have to be analyzed using techniques similar to the one presented in this paper .",
    "polarization measurements have the sensitivity to certain cosmological parameters which is not achievable from the temperature measurements alone .",
    "this sensitivity is particularly important on large angular scales , where previously used approximations break down and have to be replaced with the exact expressions for the polarization power spectra presented in this paper .",
