    ". this modification of the hopping matrix will allow us to study the effects of the impurity link on the eigenvalue spectrum and propagation of the initially localized state .",
    "the evolution of a state vector initially localized on the first chain site is displayed in fig .  [",

    "we now study a case in which randomness is introduced in the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the orbital energies @xmath53 are given random values in a band of width @xmath70 .",
    "because these numbers are along the diagonal of the hamiltonian , the model is said to have diagonal disorder .",
    "the sub - diagonal matrix elements are the same as before ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "there are a number of interesting issues related to this model , one of which is called anderson localization .",
    "the suitably modified code in appendix  a can be used to study the anderson s diagonal disorder hamiltonian .",
    "the number of sites is increased to @xmath72 and the orbital energies along the diagonal are given uniform random values in the interval @xmath73 $ ] , that is , @xmath74 .",
    "one of the features of this problem is that all the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are localized.@xcite the eigenvalue spectrum and three characteristic eigenvectors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slika3 ] .",
    "the fact that all the eigenvectors are localized has a profound influence on the propagation of an initially localized state .",
    "figure  [ fig : slika3a ] displays an evolution of a state vector initially localized on the first chain site .",
    "occupation probabilities for the first 30 sites of the chain are presented ; the site occupation probabilities are negligible beyond site 10 .",
    "note that the times shown are very long ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "we conclude that the propagation of the excitation through the chain is not only slow , but is effectively blocked  the excitation remains localized in the vicinity of the site at which it was initially created.@xcite the blockage of the excitation propagation is related to the fact that the projection coefficients ( @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi0 ] ) ) of the initially localized state have a significant magnitude only for several eigenstates whose localization on the first site is nonvanishing .",
    "one of those eigenvectors ( the one whose maximum magnitude is on the first site ) is very similar to the initial state vector , and its projection coefficient is the largest and close to 1 .",
    "thus , the initial state is almost an eigenstate and its evolution is thus slow . because the projection coefficients @xmath25 on eigenvectors that are localized on sites that are very distant from the first chain site",
    "are close to zero , the propagation through the chain is essentially blocked .",
    "the total number of the sites that become occupied during the evolution ( about 5 to 10 as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : slika3a ] ) is related to the typical localization width of the eigenvectors .",
    "it is interesting to see how the possible correlations in the diagonal disorder distribution influence the nature of the eigenvectors and the spectrum of eigenvalues ( see for example , refs .   and ) .",
    "these effects could be studied with suitable changes of the code .",
    "the localization of electronic states due to disorder may drive a metal - insulator transition ( or anderson transition ) in the system , and one - dimensional models similar to the one discussed in this article are useful in the study of random binary alloys.@xcite in this case there are only two characteristic orbital energies and their appearance in the chain is random ( for example , the appearance of the a orbital occurs with probability @xmath76 , while the appearance of the b orbital occurs with probability @xmath77 ) . for a random binary alloy ,",
    "the system again exhibit the localization of eigenvectors , but correlations in the disorder may introduce resonant states for which there is perfect electron transmission through the system .",
    "the electrical conduction of biological polymers , dna in particular , has also attracted much attention.@xcite an electronic coupling induced through the overlap of @xmath78 orbitals perpendicular to the planes of the stacked base pairs in double - stranded dna can be simulated using the simplified one - dimensional model in eq .  , although the realistic situation is much more complicated due to the influence of vibrations on the distances between the base pairs and the importance of the electronic structure of the dna backbone .",
    "@xcite models similar to the one studied in this article are used to study the conduction properties of dna molecules.@xcite    the model and the program in appendix  [ sec : append ] can be easily modified to study these problems .",
    "correlations in the diagonal disorder can be studied , as well as the introduction of disorder along the sub - diagonals ( hopping matrix elements ) .",
    "localization effects can be studied in cases when the width of the diagonal energy band @xmath70 is much smaller than the value of the hopping matrix elements @xmath48 .",
