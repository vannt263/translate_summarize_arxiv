    "a possible extension of conventional four - dimensional field theory models is based on the well known brane world scenario . according to this scenario , ordinary matter",
    "is assumed to be trapped in a submanifold with three spatial dimensions ( brane world ) that is embedded in a multi - dimensional manifold ( bulk ) .",
    "contrary to ordinary matter , gravitons are allowed to propagate in the bulk .",
    "the new feature in this scenario is that the extra dimensions can be large or even infinite .",
    "in addition brane world models predict interesting phenomenology even at tev scale @xcite , and put on a new basis fundamental problems such as the hierarchy and the cosmological constant problem ( see also the reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the typical example of a brane - world model with an infinite warped extra dimension is the second randall - sundrum model ( rs2-model ) @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", we have a single brane with a positive energy density ( the tension @xmath4 ) , whereas the bulk has a negative five dimensional cosmological constant @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding einstein equations have a solution only if a fine - tuning condition is satisfied ( @xmath6 ) , in units where @xmath7 .",
    "this solution implies a space - time geometry of the form of @xmath8 around the brane , and minkowski with zero effective cosmological constant on the brane .",
    "an extension of the rs2-model with a second negative tension @xmath9 brane , is the rs1-model @xcite . in this case",
    "we have an orbifolded extra dimension of radius @xmath10 .",
    "the two branes are fitted to the fixed points of the orbifold , @xmath11 and @xmath12 with tensions @xmath4 and @xmath9 correspondingly .",
    "the particles of the standard model are assumed to be trapped on the negative tension brane , which is called visible , while the positive tension brane is called hidden .    in this work",
    "we study the rs2-model with a nonminimally coupled bulk scalar field , via an interaction term of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is a dimensionless coupling .",
    "possesses two characteristic values : a ) the minimal coupling for @xmath14 and b ) the conformal coupling for @xmath15 the motivation is to examine whether this model possesses static solutions other than the standard one of the rs2-model ( see eq . ( 2 ) below ) .",
    "in particular we show , by solving numerically the einstein equations with the appropriate boundary conditions on the brane , that according to the value of the nonminimal coupling @xmath1 our model possesses three classes of new static solutions : ( a ) for @xmath16 the solutions develop a naked singularity in the bulk , ( b ) for @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the five dimensional conformal coupling ) we find that the warp factor @xmath19 is of the order of unity near the brane and increases exponentially ( @xmath20 ) , as @xmath21 , while the scalar field @xmath22 is nonzero on the brane and tends rapidly to zero in the bulk ( in this case the space - time is asymptotically @xmath8 ) , and ( c ) for @xmath23 the warp factor @xmath19 and the scalar field @xmath22 tend rapidly to infinity .",
    "contrary to case ( b ) , where the scalar curvature is asymptotically constant , in case ( c ) the scalar curvature tends to infinity .",
    "in addition we examine what happens when the fine tuning of the rs2-model is violated , and we obtain that in appropriate regions of the parameters of the problem the three classes of solutions we described above are preserved .",
    "this work is motivated by our previous paper @xcite .",
    "in particular in @xcite we investigated the spectrum of a nonminimally coupled bulk scalar field in the background of the rs2-metric .",
    "we obtain that for @xmath16 the spectrum of the scalar field exhibits a unique bound state with negative energy , or a tachyon mode .",
    "note that the existence of a localized tachyon mode indicates a gravity - induced dvali - shifman mechanism @xcite as we argue in @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note , that this mechanism for the localization of gauge field , from the point of view of lattice , has been investigated in refs.@xcite . in @xcite",
    "we had not examined the spectrum of the scalar field in the case of @xmath24 .",
    "we complete this investigation here . in the region",
    "@xmath25 we obtain that there is no tachyon mode ( see appendix a ) .",
    "however the tachyon mode returns the spectrum of the scalar field exhibits at least one tachyon mode , while for larger values of @xmath1 it is possible to have two or more tachyon modes , see appendix a ] for @xmath17 .",
    "the existence of tachyon modes for @xmath16 or @xmath17 implies an instability for both the rs2-metric and the scalar field ( @xmath26 ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the question that arises is whether there exist other new static stable solutions where the system can relax . as we discussed in the previous paragraph",
    "this model indeed possesses static solutions different from the standard one of the rs2-model .",
    "the stability and possible implications of these numerical solutions are discussed in the main part of this paper .",
    "the spectrum of a nonminimally coupled bulk scalar field in the case of rs1-model @xcite has been also considered @xcite , where it was found that the tachyon character of the model remains in appropriate regions of @xmath1 . however , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite are not interested to examine the stability of the rs - model , or to solve the einstein equations .",
    "they mainly use this result in order to put the standard model on the brane ( negative tension brane ) with a bulk higgs field and a gravity - induced higgs mechanism .    in the case of four dimensions",
    "the same nonminimally coupled model has been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite in the background of de sitter space - time .",
    "it is obtained that for a specific range of values of @xmath1 the scalar field is rendered unstable , and this result has straightforward implications to the cosmological constant problem .",
    "the action which describes the rs2-model , if we set @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the five - dimensional newton constant ) , is @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 parameterizes the extra dimension .",
    "in addition @xmath32 is the five - dimensional ricci scalar , @xmath33 is the determinant of the five - dimensional metric tensor @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 is the determinant of the induced metric on the brane .",

    "of course if we wish to construct a brane world scenario , we should put a second brane in the bulk before the singularity .",

    "@xcite it is argued that this kind of solutions may have physical interest even without a second brane . in particular , there is a possibility that quantum gravity effects near the singularity push the singularity to infinite proper distance in the bulk . in this way , the singularity acts effectively as a physical end to the extra dimension z ( for more details see ref .",
    "a way to take into account quantum gravity effects , is to add to the gravity action of eq .",
    "( 1 ) a gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we have performed numerical computations also for this case and the answer is that gauss - bonnet gravity can not resolve the naked singularity ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite we tried to guess the form of the new static stable solution where the system is expected to relax .",
    "in particular , we supposed that the profile of the scalar field vacuum in the bulk is proportional to the wave function of the tachyon mode ( or the scalar field vacuum is nonzero on the brane and tends rapidly to zero in the bulk ) . if we take for granted that @xmath112 for @xmath113 , the warp factor for @xmath114 must be of the form @xmath102 or @xmath115 , as only these two functions satisfy the einstein equations if we set @xmath103 . in ref .",

    "however in this work , by solving numerically the einstein equations with the appropriate boundary conditions , we obtain a completely different behavior for the warp factor and the scalar field vacuum .",

    "we find a different class of solutions , however it is not of physical interest .    in the down - right panel of fig .",
    "[ con1 ] we observe that the effective mass of the scalar field is negative .",
    "however the solutions for @xmath2 are stable , as in appendix c we find that the scalar field does not exhibit four dimensional tachyon modes .",
    "the result of stability implies that the solutions for @xmath2 can be used as the background for the construction of a brane - world scenario .",
    "now we will try to discuss possible physical implications of the solutions in the case of conformal coupling .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the warp factor behaves as @xmath166 for large @xmath31 ( see the down - left panel of fig .",
    "[ con1 ] ) .",
    "it is well known that an exponentially increasing warp factor comes from negative tension brane with @xmath167 .",
    "hence , the positive tension brane at @xmath11 @xmath168 together with the negative energy density of the scalar field vacuum @xmath169 , act effectively as a negative tension brane , which creates the exponential profile @xmath166 for the warp factor .",
    "note that the energy density of the scalar field has a finite size extension into the bulk of the order of @xmath170 , as we see in the upper - right panel of fig .",
    "the model is completed if we include a second positive tension brane with @xmath171 , in a position @xmath172 where the scalar field vacuum is practically zero ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "this two - brane set up is very similar to the well known rs1-model ( see introduction ) . in analogy with the rs1-model",
    ", we will assume that the standard model particles live in the effectively negative tension brane , or visible brane .",
    "note that in our case the visible brane is a formation of the positive tension brane with @xmath154 and the negative energy density @xmath169 of the scalar field vacuum .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it incorporates a mechanism for the localization of standard model particles on the visible brane .",
    "we can enrich our model with a gauge field symmetry , i.e. su(5 ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that this gauge field symmetry ( su(5 ) ) is spontaneously broken to @xmath174 near the brane , due to the nonzero value of the scalar field , while it is restored in the bulk for @xmath175 , where the value of the scalar field is practically zero .",
    "this phase structure , higgs phase on the brane and confinement phase in the bulk , triggers the dvali - shifman mechanism @xcite for localization of gauge fields . in this way the gauge fields of @xmath174 and the matter fields with gauge charge ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) are localized on the brane , as for escaping in the bulk , it requires energy equal to @xmath176 , where @xmath176 is the mass gap emerging from the nonperturbative confining dynamics of the su(5 ) gauge field theory in the bulk .    in the case of the rs1-model ,",
    "when ordinary matter is localized on the negative tension brane , we have the relation @xmath177 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath178 is the four - dimensional planck scale , @xmath179 is the fundamental five - dimensional gravity scale , k is the inverse @xmath124 radius , and @xmath172 is the position of the second positive tension brane in the bulk .",
    "we have checked that the above relation is valid approximately also for the model we examine .",
    "if we wish to have strong gravity at tev we must choose @xmath180 . according to this localization mechanism the particles on the visible brane",
    "see an effective length toward the extra dimension of the order of @xmath181 .",
    "if we take into account that the masses of ordinary particles are smaller than 1tev , we must choose @xmath182 .",
    "for example , if @xmath183 we obtain @xmath184 , and thus the position of the second brane is @xmath185 .    note that even for a zero tension ( @xmath156 ) brane at @xmath11 , we obtained solutions of the form we described in the previous paragraphs , see fig .",
    "[ con2 ] . in this case",
    "the visible brane is formed only from the negative energy density of the nonminimally coupled bulk scalar field , as we see in the down - left panel of fig .",
    "in addition , we have found that the numerical solutions , for small values of @xmath163 ( @xmath186 ) , can be approximated with a very good accuracy from the analytical expressions @xmath187 .",
    "these expressions satisfy the constraint equation ( 14 ) .",
    "however , their second derivatives are not in agreement with the second derivatives of the numerical solutions , hence the equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) are not satisfied by the above mentioned analytical expressions .",
    "in this work we studied for the first time the rs2-model with a nonminimally coupled bulk scalar field , via an interaction term @xmath188 . by solving numerically the einstein equations with the appropriate boundary conditions on the brane , we showed that depending on the value of the nonminimal coupling @xmath1 this model possesses three classes of new static solutions with different characteristics .    class ( a ) ( @xmath16 ) develops a naked singularity in the bulk . class ( b ) ( @xmath118 ) consists of solutions which are characterized by an exponential warp factor @xmath189 , as @xmath126 , and a scalar field @xmath22 which is nonzero on the brane and tends rapidly to zero in the bulk .",
    "the solutions of class ( c ) ( @xmath143 ) are characterized by a very fast increase of the warp factor ( faster than class ( b ) ) , and a scalar field @xmath22 which tends rapidly to infinity for large @xmath31 .",
    "the cases of minimal and conformal coupling ( @xmath14 and @xmath2 ) have been discussed separately in sections 4.1 and 4.2 .",
    "an interesting point is that these three classes of solutions exist even when the standard fine tuning of the rs - model is violated . in order to construct a brane world model by using these solutions ,",
    "it is necessary to assume a second brane in the bulk .",
    "however , in this case we should impose a new fine tuning between the parameters of the model , if we wish to satisfy the boundary conditions on the second brane .",
    "in addition , we have examined the stability properties of the new solutions",
    ". the solutions of class ( a ) ( @xmath16 ) and class ( b ) ( @xmath118 ) are unstable against scalar field perturbations , as in appendix b we have found that the spectrum of the scalar field around these solutions exhibits a tachyon character . the only way to render these solutions stable is to put a second brane in the bulk before the potential for the scalar field v(w ) becomes negative ( for details see appendix b ) .",
    "the solutions of class ( c ) are stable , as the scalar field spectrum has no tachyon modes .",
    "we emphasize that this work has been motivated by our previous work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where we had assumed the same model with an additional gauge field symmetry for the scalar field . in particular , in that work we have argued for a gravity - induced localization mechanism for @xmath16 , which is very useful for the localization of gauge fields on the brane . in this mechanism",
    "we have a specific phase structure : confinement phase in the bulk and higgs phase on the brane .",
    "gauge fields , and more generally fermions and bosons with gauge charge ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , can not escape into the bulk unless we give them energy greater than the mass gap @xmath176 , which emerges from the nonperturbative confining dynamics of the gauge field model in the bulk . in ref .",
    "@xcite we observed that the effective mass @xmath190 , for @xmath16 , is negative on the brane and positive in the bulk .",
    "this result indicates a phase structure which can trigger the dvali - shifman mechanism in a gravitational way .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the sign of the effective mass , in the case of curved space - time , is just an indication for the expected phase structure and is not a strict proof .",
    "a realistic gravity - induced localization mechanism requires a static stable solution with a nonzero scalar field on the brane which vanishes rapidly in the bulk . in ref .",
    "@xcite we assumed the existence of a solution of the form we described above .",
    "however , the correct way to find if a solution of this kind really exists , is to solve the complete system of einstein equations , as we do in this paper .",
    "we found that no static stable solution of the required form exists for @xmath16 .",
    "additionally , we obtained that for @xmath16 the solutions suffer from a naked singularity in the bulk , see figs .",
    "[ 1],[2 ] and [ 3 ] .",
    "we tried to resolve this naked singularity by adding a gauss - bonnet term to the gravity action .",
    "we performed numerical computations and we found that the naked singularity remains even in the case of gauss - bonnet gravity . according to the above analysis , it seems that no realistic gravity - induced localization mechanism for @xmath16 can be constructed .",
    "finally , we have examined the case of conformal coupling ( @xmath2 ) when the fine tuning of the rs - model is violated , see section 4.1 .",
    "we obtain that the solutions for @xmath2 have the same characteristics with those of the solutions of class ( b ) ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "however , there is an important difference between them , as the solutions for @xmath2 are stable against scalar field perturbation ( see appendix c ) , contrary to the case of second class , where the solutions are unstable ( see appendix b ) . in section 4.2",
    "we argue that this class of static stable solutions can be used for the construction of a realistic brane world scenario , which is very similar to the well known rs1-model . in this scenario ,",
    "the visible brane is a formation of the positive tension brane @xmath4 at @xmath11 , plus the negative energy density of the nonminimally coupled scalar field .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it incorporates a mechanism ( gravity - induced dvali - shifman mechanism ) for the localization of standard model particles on the visible brane together with the spontaneous breaking of a grand unified gauge group .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the above mentioned scenario remains even in the case of a zero tension brane at @xmath11 ( @xmath156 ) . in this case , the visible brane is formatted only from the negative energy density of the bulk scalar field .",
