    "<S> let us first outline what we can anticipate based on some simple but general arguments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> suppose the binary lipid membrane is close to a critical point for phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> below the critical temperature @xmath31 , lipids form laterally  phase - separated regions (  rafts \" ) . </S>",

    "<S> raft - like structures were also observed in artificial lipid membranes consisting of a binary mixture with one phase rich in the unsaturated lipids and the other rich in the saturated lipids and cholesterol @xcite . below @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> , phase - separated membranes also have inhomogeneous elastic properties , which lead to formation of nontrivial spatial structures @xcite that are beyond our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , we focus on membrane diffusion at temperatures slightly above @xmath31 , where lipids form nearly uniform mixture with correlation length diverging on approaching @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> if proteins strongly prefer one kind of lipid versus the other , they will preferentially segregate in the correlated regions ( which we can also consider as  rafts \" ) corresponding to one of the emerging phases . on time </S>",
    "<S> scales longer than it takes for the protein to diffuse across such rafts , the overall protein motion becomes essentially passive and governed by lipid concentration intermixing . </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown that the protein size @xmath3 must then be replaced by the correlation length @xmath32 in order to obtain the effective diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is then approximately given by the einstein relation ( [ e ] ) with mobility @xmath12 scaling as @xmath33 ( assuming momentum conservation within the membrane ) , which is inversely proportional to the drag force exerted by the membrane fluid on a drifting raft of size @xmath32 , where we in general consider a @xmath34-dimensional system ( eventually setting @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus have @xmath36 where in general both @xmath9 and @xmath7 can be temperature dependent . for @xmath37 , the right - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dmu ] ) vanishes near the critical temperature where @xmath32 diverges . short - range physics on length scales shorter than @xmath32 , which is disregarded here , then has to be invoked in order to calculate the product @xmath38 . when @xmath39 , on the other hand , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dmu ] ) diverges near @xmath31 signaling emergence of important long - distance processes . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 is the critical dimension where one may expect only logarithmic singularities due to long - distance physics , as we will indeed see in the following . </S>",
    "<S> when there is a rigid substrate exerting a friction on the two - dimensional membrane dynamics , however , the diffusion coefficient can acquire a power - law dependence on both @xmath32 and the distance to the substrate , making the diffusion very sensitive to the environment near @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , as explained in the following , there is a regime where the protein size @xmath3 is effectively replaced by the correlation length @xmath32 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ es ] ) , resulting in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dth ] ) for large @xmath32 . </S>",

    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dmu ] ) is also relevant for diffusion away from the critical point , where @xmath32 may be replaced by @xmath40 and the diffusion coefficient and viscosity become wavevector - dependent functions , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the long - distance physics at @xmath43 is important for @xmath44 , consistent with the result of the linearized theory for @xmath35 , which gives @xmath45 for wavelengths </S>",

    "<S> ( [ qa ] ) unmodified away from the critical point , the logarithmic singularity is _ not _ entirely contained in @xmath9 ; in fact , the effective viscosity @xmath7 may also acquire a finite - temperature logarithmic @xmath46 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we study this phenomenon first , before discussing diffusion near the critical point , in order to understand how the membrane viscosity itself depends on temperature and relevant length scales .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now formulate the model . focusing on the long - wavelength two - dimensional dynamics , we write navier - stokes equation for membrane fluid velocity field subject to a random forcing function @xmath47 : @xmath48 where all vectors have two components in the @xmath49 plane , e.g. , @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the field @xmath51 is the position- and time - dependent fluid velocity , @xmath52 is a constant mass density and @xmath53 the kinematic viscosity of the membrane fluid . </S>",
    "<S> ( in writing a strictly two - dimensional navier - stokes equation , we have assumed a large planar shear viscosity within the membrane , relative to the fluid outside . ) </S>",
    "<S> the coupling @xmath54 describes friction due to a nearby rigid substrate . if the friction is mediated by a constant - gradient laminar flow of a liquid layer of thickness @xmath0 with viscosity @xmath19 , then @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for simplicity , we introduce the coupling @xmath54 only on one side of the membrane . ) </S>",
    "<S> we are assuming here that @xmath56 ; otherwise the membrane does not sense the substrate and @xmath0 has to be replaced by @xmath57 in the definition of @xmath54 for lateral lengthscales smaller than @xmath57 . </S>",

    "<S> of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ns ] ) is the usual ( nonlinear ) advective term when @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> we will be able to treat it using an rg approach @xcite where @xmath61 becomes a perturbative parameter weakly irrelevant for large - distance asymptotics . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation - dissipation theorem dictates the form of @xmath62 in correspondence with the dissipative terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ns ] ) : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the fourier transform of the velocity distribution , @xmath65 is a rescaled temperature , and @xmath66 is the transverse projection operator . </S>",
    "<S> we note that when coupling @xmath54 is mediated by a thin liquid interlayer connecting the membrane with the substrate , we account for it by assuming a simple laminar flow , which is not perturbed by thermal fluctuations and which responds instantaneously to the driving shear provided by the membrane dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearities and stochasticity are fully contained within the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> we thus neglect quasi - two - dimensional nonlinear and thermal effects as well as inertia in the interlayer . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect that these complications simply lead to a renormalization of parameters such as @xmath61 , @xmath52 , @xmath54 , and @xmath67 in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ es ] ) , this result includes the fluid - mediated friction between protein and the substrate , which we have not explicitly considered in the above discussion . </S>",
    "<S> as we have already explained , we can neglect thermal renormalization of @xmath118 ( and thus @xmath101 and @xmath121 ) for biological systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss how these results are modified close to a critical point for phase separation in binary lipid membranes , leading to a much more dramatic dependence of diffusion on temperature and membrane environment . to be specific , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider concentration interdiffusion in a symmetric binary mixture of , say , lipids @xmath122 and @xmath123 with concentrations @xmath124 and @xmath125 @xcite . by symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , the critical point corresponds to equal average concentrations : @xmath126 , where @xmath68 is the averaged total concentration ( taken to be constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter @xmath127 is given by the normalized difference of the concentrations : @xmath128/c$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the total concentration , @xmath129 , does not couple to the @xmath130 diffusion mode in this case . </S>",
    "<S> following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we introduce a fictitious external potential @xmath131 , which couples to @xmath130 , by choosing opposite potentials for the two lipid components : @xmath132 and @xmath133 . the force on a region with a roughly uniform order parameter @xmath134 of size @xmath32 ( the order - parameter correlation length ) </S>",
    "<S> is then given by @xmath135 assuming a long - wavelength ( on the scale of @xmath32 ) driving field @xmath131 , where @xmath136 is the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> the region will accelerate until reaching velocity @xmath76 when @xmath137 is canceled by the viscous drag @xmath138 characterized by mobility @xmath12 : @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus get for the net current density of the order parameter @xmath130 within the region of size @xmath32 : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the concentration conductivity associated with the potential @xmath131 and @xmath142 is the susceptibility of the concentration difference @xmath130 . the last equality in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lb ] ) is obtained by invoking the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath143 implying averaging over correlated regions ( over the entire system ) . for a smooth static external potential , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath144 in equilibrium , and thus the current density @xmath145 must be proportional to @xmath146 . in the absence of the fictitious potential @xmath131 , </S>",
    "<S> the concentration flows are then described by the diffusion coefficient @xmath9 : @xmath147 with @xmath148 where we have used eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lb ] ) for the last equality . since @xmath130 is a conserved quantity , @xmath149 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exi ] ) is simply the einstein relation ( [ e ] ) , with one conceptual subtlety : @xmath9 and @xmath12 describe not the transport coefficients of individual small particles , but rather the ( inter)diffusion coefficient of a binary mixture and the mobility of a region of size @xmath32 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we can approximate the latter by the mobility of a  particle \" of size @xmath32 , which in turn corresponds to the diffusion coefficient ( [ esr ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from this line of argument that the diffusion coefficient of proteins  riding \" rafts with order parameter @xmath134 of a given sign [ determined by protein affinity to a given kind of lipids , either @xmath122 ( @xmath150 ) or @xmath123 ( @xmath151 ) ] is given by equation ( [ esr ] ) with @xmath152 . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath153 and the correlation length @xmath32 diverges , @xmath154 and the diffusion coefficient approaches @xmath155 ( assuming @xmath18 ) , as we discussed in the introduction ( see also the small-@xmath156 asymptotic of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the membrane viscosity @xmath7 in fact also has a diverging contribution near @xmath31 , but fortunately with a very small exponent ( @xmath157 in two dimensions ) @xcite , so that as long as @xmath154 it drops out of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dth ] ) for the diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the exponents that govern the correlation - length and susceptibility @xmath158 divergence near the critical temperature can be calculated in the two - dimensional ising model ( which is in the same universality class as the binary mixture ) , giving @xmath159 and @xmath160 . upon combining eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exi ] ) , ( [ dth ] ) , and ( [ chi ] ) , we find for the conductivity scaling @xmath161 , which vanishes with a small exponent @xmath162 at the critical temperature . in practice , however , equation </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lb ] ) with @xmath12 standing for the mobility of a rigid region of size @xmath32 neglects short - range ( on the scale of @xmath32 ) fluctuations that can lead to a finite conductivity @xmath163 at the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion coefficient ( [ exi ] ) then has to be correspondingly corrected , giving near @xmath31 ( with @xmath154 ) @xmath164 with the second contribution eventually dominating very near @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the constants @xmath163 and @xmath165 are nonuniversal , dependent on nonuniversal details of the lipid mixtures ; @xmath166 is a characteristic lipid spacing .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with a discussion of one final point : although the correlation length grows , density fluctuations eventually disappear at the critical temperature and the protein diffusion is not critically slowed down . upon combining eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fdt2 ] ) and ( [ chi ] ) , we get @xmath167 near @xmath31 , in terms of some dimensionless constant @xmath168 . </S>",
    "<S> we make a mean - field approximation for the free - energy difference for a single protein residing in region @xmath122 ( @xmath150 ) and region @xmath123 ( @xmath151 ) , @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the order - parameter difference between the regions , and assume that the proteins will thermally hop between the correlated regions , and thus freely diffuse within the membrane when @xmath171 , i.e. , when the correlation length becomes larger than @xmath172 a relation which in two dimensions is characterized by a large exponent @xmath173 . </S>",
    "<S> _ very _ close to the critical point where the correlation length is larger than eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xi ] ) , the protein diffusion is thus not profoundly affected by the critical behavior apart from the weak singularity in the membrane viscosity .    </S>",
    "<S> we can make a crude estimate of @xmath174 as follows . </S>",
    "<S> suppose @xmath175 is of order the energy difference between a typical protein embedded in the two - chain lipids and a typical protein embedded in the one - chain lipids . </S>",
    "<S> a typical protein size is 50   ; with a lipid head size of 6 - 10   , maybe 20 lipids ( ten from each leaflet ) surround each protein . assume the protein spans the bilayer , so each of @xmath176 ch@xmath177 groups of the lipid chains above and below can interact with the protein </S>",
    "<S> . a typical hydrogen bond or van  der  waals attractive interaction with a ch@xmath177 might be @xmath178 at room temperature . since roughly 100 ch@xmath177 groups are in contact in one case ( single hydrocarbon chain ) , and 200 ch@xmath177 groups in the other ( two hydrocarbon chains ) , the energy difference is @xmath179 . in situations where both lipid species have two hydrocarbon chains , </S>",
    "<S> the energy difference could arise from the different head groups ( not included in the above ) and from the typical fact that one species has an unsaturated bond in the hydrocarbon chain ( making protein interactions with part of the chain difficult ) and the other does not . </S>",
    "<S> also , the chain lengths might differ by 2 - 3 ch@xmath177 groups . </S>",
    "<S> all these factors together might lead to @xmath180 in less favorable situations . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath168 can be estimated by the mean - field approximation of the ising model @xcite : using the form @xmath181 [ @xmath182 is the reduced temperature ] of the landau free - energy density , one gets for the mean - field response function @xmath183 and the correlation length @xmath184 . according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dth ] ) then @xmath185 and @xmath186 ( instead of the correct @xmath160 since the mean - field approximation captures the exponents correctly only at more than four dimensions ) . for the ising model , </S>",
    "<S> a mean - field estimate gives @xmath187 for short - range interactions , where @xmath188 is the range of exchange coupling . </S>",
    "<S> using the estimates ( [ kappa ] ) and ( [ c ] ) , we finally conclude that @xmath189 according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xi ] ) , which clearly suggests that the reasoning leading to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ df ] ) holds for a large range of the correlation length @xmath32 ( apart from temperatures _ very _ close to @xmath31 where the critical slowing down is suppressed ) .    in summary , we have considered the effects of thermal noise , hydrodynamic nonlinearities , and proximity to a critical point on protein diffusion in multicomponent lipid membranes close to a rigid substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that nonlinear advection in the navier - stokes equation in practice gives only a small correction to the evans - sackmann result ( [ es ] ) for a uniform lipid composition . </S>",
    "<S> the protein diffusion is then only logarithmically sensitive to the distance to the wall , assuming the protein size @xmath190 . upon approaching the critical temperature for the phase separation in multicomponent membranes , however , </S>",
    "<S> the long - time asymptotic of protein diffusion can be reformulated in terms of the lipid  raft \" diffusion of size @xmath32 , which diverges at @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion coefficient then becomes _ linearly _ sensitive to the distance to the substrate @xmath0 and has a roughly @xmath191 scaling with the correlation length , near @xmath31 ( apart from a narrow temperature window very close to @xmath31 where proteins thermally hop between the rafts ) . </S>",
