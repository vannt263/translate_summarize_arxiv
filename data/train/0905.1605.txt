    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are a class of galaxies that show signs of non - stellar emission , believed to be associated with processes connected to accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh , e.g. rees 1984 ) .",
    "direct and re - processed radiation arising from the accretion process itself is responsible for much of the emission of the agn between x - rays and the mid - infrared ( e.g. krolik 1999 ) .",
    "the radio emission , however , is synchrotron radiation from radio components typically associated with jets launched from the central region .",
    "the jets might be powered by magnetic fields leaving the accretion disk ( blandford & payne 1982 ) or by field lines leaving the horizon of the spinning black hole itself ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "star - formation in the host galaxy can dominate the energy output at far - infrared and sub - millimetre wavelengths ( e.g. rowan - robinson 1995 ) and lead to the emission of synchrotron emission at radio wavelengths .",
    "such emission is seeded by cosmic ray electrons accelerated by processes associated with supernovae ( sne ) and their remnants , and synchrotron cooling occurs via interaction with magnetic fields both local to the sites of sne and , following diffusion away from these sites , throughout the agn host galaxy ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "the most bolometrically luminous agn are dubbed quasars ( with absolute blue magnitude @xmath7 when they are not obscured ) , while lower luminosity agn are known as seyferts .",
    "this is mainly a taxonomically designation , since quasars and seyferts seem to form a continous progression in agn luminosity , most likely controlled by the accretion rate onto the smbh .",
    "many of the differences in observed properties between broad - line ( type 1 ) and narrow - line ( type 2 ) quasars can be ascribed to orientation - dependent obscuration , perhaps due to a torus of obscuring material on larger scales than , but approximately co - aligned with , the accretion disk .",
    "the powerful radio - selected agn ( radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies ) are found to show distinct structural properties depending on their radio luminosity : the brightest sources ( fanaroff - riley 1974 , class - ii ; fr  ii ) show double - lobed jets with the brightest emission from hotspots and head regions at the edge of the lobes , while the less - luminous fr  i sources have the brightest emission near the base of the jet , with the surface brightness decreasing with distance from the centre .",
    "the range in radio luminosity is believed to be closely connected to a range in bulk kinetic powers in the jets in a way that is seemingly connected to the underlying accretion rate onto the smbh ( e.g. rawlings & saunders 1991 ) .",
    "when the orientation of the jet is close enough to the line of sight , doppler - boosting ( beaming ) effects can affect the observed radio emission ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "quasars are usually classified as radio - loud ( rlq ) or radio - quiet ( rqq ) either from their ratio of radio to optical luminosity ( e.g. kellerman et al . 1989 ) , with rlqs having a ratio @xmath810 , or from their radio luminosities ( miller , peacock & mead 1990 ) , with rlq having @xmath9  whz@xmath10sr@xmath10 , rqq having @xmath11  whz@xmath10sr@xmath10 .",
    "quasars with radio luminosities in between these values are classified as radio - intermediate ( riq ) , and this radio luminosity corresponds approximately to that of fr  i radio galaxies",
    ". however , most radio - selected fr  i radio galaxies have intrinsically weaker bolometric luminosities due to low accretion rates ( e.g. hine & longair 1979 ) .",
    "the large majority of quasars , @xmath190% , are rqq ( kellermann et  al .",
    "1989 , and more recently ivezi et  al .",
    "2002 ) , and it is still not clear whether there is a real dichotomy between the rlq and the rqq populations ( see e.g. ivezi et  al . 2002 ; cirasuolo et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the physical reason why some quasars are radio - loud is also still unclear , given that quasars which output similar radiative bolometric luminosities can show a huge range of radio luminosities , suggesting wildly different jet powers .",
    "obsering the palomar - green bright quasar sample ( bqs ) at radio frequencies , miller , rawlings & saunders ( 1993 ) suggested that jets are ubiquitous in rqq as well as rlq .",
    "miller et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) also suggested that riq are intrinsically rqq , only the line - of - sight of the observer is closely aligned with the base of the jet .",
    "relativistic doppler boosting of the radio emission makes these rqq appear brighter to the observer , who classifies them as riq .",
    "the observations of falcke et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and kukula et al .",
    "( 1998 ) supported this scenario to some extent .",
    "the former observed with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) three flat - spectrum riq and found high brightness temperatures ( @xmath12 k ) and no extended emission , suggesting emission dominated by a doppler - boosted core .",
    "the latter observed a sample of rqq from the bqs , which included two riq .",
    "they found these two riq to have flat or inverted spectra , variable fluxes and high values of @xmath13 , unlike the rqq , supporting the beaming scenario .",
    "however , they also found extended emission on scales larger than those observed in rqq .",
    "it must also be noted that falcke et al .",
    "choose three riq that were known to be flat - spectrum , thus biasing their study , while kukula et al . only had two riq in their sample .",
    "thus , neither of their results on beaming of riq were conclusive .    for a long time",
    "there has been a dearth of quasars with fr  i - structures .",
    "however , blundell & rawlings ( 2001 ) and heywood , blundell & rawlings ( 2007 ) have shown this lack of fr  i quasars might be an artefact of snapshot radio images with relatively long baselines , which are less sensitive to extended structure with low surface brightness .",

    "( 2006b , ms06b ) observed a sample of @xmath0 obscured quasars with luminosities comparable to those of riq and fr  i radio galaxies , and found most of them to have steep spectra , thus ruling them out as beamed rqq .",
    "while the nature of riq might still be unclear , it seems certain that rqq often possess scaled - down versions of the jets seen in rlq .",

    "the radio properties of seyfert galaxies suggest these are the natural low - luminosity extensions of quasars : most of the sources have steep radio spectra , but flatter spectra are sometimes found ( kukula et al .",
    "approximately half of the sources have only compact ( @xmath18  pc ) emission , with no hint of extended emission , and the other half show extended emission , sometimes on scales @xmath41  kpc ( kukula et al . 1995 ; gallimore et al .",

    "this paper presents vlbi observations of a subsample of high - redshift , radio - intermediate obscured quasars .",
    "the original sample was selected using a combination of data at 24  @xmath19 m , 3.6  @xmath19 m and 1.4  ghz , and was used to argue that most of the smbh growth is obscured by dust ( martnez - sansigre et  al .",

    "2008 , hereafter ms08 ) .",
    "it has been argued that the obscured quasars come in two flavours : classic type 2 objects in which the quasar nucleus is obscured by a torus and `` host - obscured '' objects in which the quasar nucleus is obscured by dust distributed on larger scales within the host galaxy , and possibly associated with ongoing star formation .",
    "the inferred radio luminosities are similar to both riq and fr  i radio sources ( ms06b ) .",
    "multiple radio frequencies showed most of the sources have very steep spectra @xmath21 ( ms06b ) .",
    "this is consistent with lobe emission with the same time - steady electron injection spectrum as lower - redshift radio galaxies [ electron number densities @xmath22 with @xmath23 , provided that the increased inverse - compton losses against the cosmic microwave backgound ( cmb ) at high redshift cause the electron energy spectrum to steepen [ @xmath24 instead of @xmath25 at the rest - frame frequencies corresponding to those observed . the observed flux density is then expected to be @xmath26 instead of @xmath27 , and will therefore have a spectral index @xmath28 rather than @xmath29 as observed for lower - redshift sources ( see e.g. kardashev 1962 ) .    indeed , from ` minimum energy ' arguments and assuming @xmath30 w hz@xmath10 sr@xmath10 with a characteristic size of 30 kpc and age of 10  myr , a @xmath31-field of 1 - 2  nt was inferred by ms06b , comparable to the field inferred in fr  i radio galaxies ( e.g. laing et al .",
    "the combined effect of synchrotron ageing in this magnetic field and inverse - compton losses against the cmb at @xmath32 could then explain the steep spectra .",
    "comparison of 1.4  ghz data at 5- and 14-arcsec resolution , showed no significant difference in flux density ( at the @xmath3323@xmath34 level ) for all but one source ( ams04 , see ms06a ) .",
    "this suggests that at rest - frame @xmath45  ghz , there is a negligible amount of flux density on scales @xmath440  kpc .",
    "however , an older population of electrons at these large distances can not be ruled out by the relatively high ( rest - frame ) frequency data used by ms06a and ms06b .",
    "mapping such emission would require low - frequency observations with an array sensitive to very extended emission .",
    "since for the ms06b sample the rest - frame @xmath15  ghz emission is relatively compact ( @xmath35 arcsec corresponding to @xmath340  kpc ) , any further spatial studies of these sources require very long baselines .",
    "such vlbi studies can determine whether the steep - spectrum lobes have characteristic sizes @xmath1kpc or @xmath35kpc and can also determine whether flat - spectrum cores are present .",
    "while most of the sources showed very steep spectra , some of the sources showed gigahertz - peaked spectra , and surprisingly for obscured quasars , some sources showed flat spectra suggesting face - on beamed jets ( ms06b ) .",
    "however , all the flat - spectrum sources were found to have blank optical spectra .",
    "this is consistent with such objects being obscured by dust on galactic scales which also hides the narrow - line region , instead of being obscured by the torus .",
    "such flat - spectrum sources with no optical lines are likely examples of `` host - obscured '' quasars .",
    "observations with vlbi are again necessary to place further constraints on any beamed components , which are expected to show compact , high-@xmath13 emission .",

    "the extremely high sfrs derived in this way , and quoted in table  [ tab : res ] , are comparable or generally greater than the sfrs inferred for submillimetre - selected galaxies @xcite , except here they are confined to a significantly smaller volume .",
    "given that the resolution of 17  mas corresponds to typically at @xmath51 , these cores have physical sizes comparable to those of the `` extreme starburst '' regions found by downes & solomon ( 1998 ) , but the sfrs are about two orders of magnitude higher .",
    "these are unreasonable sfrs for such a small region .",
    "the hypothesis of the detected cores being dense star - formation regions can also be rejected on the basis of the mass of molecular gas required to power such a sfr .",
    "an estimate of the typical star - formation density of the cores , assuming a total sfr of 14  000 in an area with diameter a 200  pc corresponds to @xmath52@xmath53 kpc@xmath54 .",

    "such extreme molecular gas masses have been observed around high - redshift quasars , but they are extended over @xmath1kpc scales and not in such a small nuclear region ( e.g. walter et al .",
    "thus , the hypothesis that the detected cores are dominated by star - formation can be safely rejected , and in the rest of this section we assume the cores to be due to an agn .",
    "table  [ tab : res ] quotes the core spectral indices , @xmath61 , derived assuming that all the flux density at 4.9  ghz at vla resolution emerges from a region comparable to the evn resolution .",
    "overall the spectral indices appear to be either relatively steep , or inverted .",
    "however , we note that within the uncertainties , most of the inverted spectra could be flat .    the flat or inverted spectrum can be understood as synchrotron self - absorption due to a high density of relativistic electrons causing the emission to be optically thick .",
    "however , none of the spectral indices are close to the expected value of @xmath62 for an entirely self - absorbed regime ( rybicki and lightman 1979 ) .",
    "such observed flat spectra can be observed if the transition between optically - thin and optically - thick ( and therefore the peak in the spectrum ) occurs at a frequency somewhere between 5.8 and 17  ghz .",
    "the expected spectral indices would then be relatively flat , consistent with those seen in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "alternatively , several emitting components , each of which becomes self - absorbed at a different frequency , when superimposed , can lead to the observed spectral indices .",
    "it is worth noting that the sources with high recovered fractions ( that is ams03 , ams05 , ams09 and ams19 ) have core spectral indices indistinguishable from the low - resolution spectral indices .",
    "this suggests the physical source of the evn flux is also the dominant component of the emission detected by the vla and therefore apparently compact .",
    "the actual mechanisms , however , probably vary from source to source , as described below .    in the case of ams05 and ams16 ,",
    "the total ( low - resolution ) spectra appear gigahertz - peaked ( ms06b ) , reminiscent of the young compact powerful radio sources ( odea 1998 ) . the core spectral index of ams05 is consistent with the low - spatial resolution spectral index ( between vla observations at 1.4 and 4.9  ghz ) , and 100% of the low - resolution flux density is recovered .",
    "this suggests the same emission is being seen at vla and evn resolutions , so that the dominant source of radio emission is compact ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this also agrees with the hypothesis of synchrotron self - absorption affecting frequencies around and below 56  ghz , while the emission at frequencies higher than this is still optically - thin and therefore shows a steep spectrum .",
    "the core spectral index of ams16 is ill defined , since the source is not detected at either 4.9 or 1.66  ghz , however a similar argument to that of ams05 would apply .",
    "most of the other sources have values of @xmath61 much flatter than their overall @xmath63 value at vla resolution .",
    "this is consistent with the following ( simplified ) scenario : flat spectrum emission from an optically - thick core contributing a significant fraction of the total luminosity , and steep - spectrum emission from optically - thin lobes from a jet . at evn resolution ,",
    "the emission from the jet lobes is resolved out , so that the core dominates , and the spectral indices appear flat or inverted .",
    "a slight modification is required in the case of ams15 and ams19 : their low - resolution spectral indices are also flat .",
    "this can be explained by doppler - boosting of the emission from the core , which would make it a more important contributor to the low - resolution spectrum , which would then appear overall flat . in the case of ams19 ,",
    "the core spectral index is also flat , and 100% of the flux is recovered , consistent with the beaming scenario .",
    "ams15 has an inverted core spectrum , and the evn recovers only 47% of the low - spatial resolution flux density .",
    "doppler - boosting is only expected when the radio jet is closely aligned with the line - of - sight , so the jet must be close to face - on . in the unified scheme , only unobscured quasars can have such a configuration . ams15 and ams19 are obscured quasars with a face - on radio jet , and neither show emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "these two objects are probably not obscured by the torus of the unified scheme , but rather by dust on a larger scale , presumably distributed along the host galaxy .",
    "this provides further evidence for the hypothesis of `` host - obscuration '' in some quasars ( martnez - sansigre et al .",
    "2005 ; ms06a ; rigby et al .",
    "2006 ) .    at first sight",
    ", one might expect flat - spectrum or gigahertz - peaked sources to have the highest detection rates , and that is indeed the case of ams05 and ams19 .",
    "however , some of the sources with the highest recovered fraction ( e.g. ams09 and ams21 ) have steep spectra overall .",
    "this can be reconciled if the total emission from ams09 and ams21 is dominated by radio emission from the lobes of jets , but these jets are small , with an extent limited to a few hundred pc .",
    "the high recovered fractions ( 67 and 86% ) are caused by most of the lobe emission being on scales smaller than the beam size , so that only a small fraction of the emission is resolved out .",
    "the `` core '' spectral indices of ams09 and ams21 are both @xmath10.5 , but within the large uncertainties they agree with the total spectral indices ( at low resolution ) between 1.4 and 4.9  ghz ( compare their values in tables  [ tab : obs ] and [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the suggestion that the `` cores '' of these two sources are actually unresolved lobes , and indeed the image of ams09 hints at some extended structure ( figure  [ fig : ima ] ) .",
    "these sources appear to be lower - luminosity analogues to compact steep - spectrum sources ( odea 1998 ) . +      in ms06a , the flux densities of this sample at 1.4  ghz obtained by the vla ( 5-arcsecond resolution , from condon et al .",
    "2003 ) and wsrt ( 14-arcsecond resolution , from morganti et al .",
    "2004 ) were compared and found to be consistent within the errors .",
    "there is no evidence for the vla to ` resolve out ' flux at 1.4  ghz on scales @xmath48 and @xmath64  arcseconds , and the the vla flux densities at 1.4  ghz ( and @xmath65 ) can be safely considered to represent the entire flux densities of the radio sources at @xmath1ghz frequencies .    there is no intermediate resolution data , and thus no information on scales @xmath66 mas and @xmath67 arcseconds , and therefore the extent of the missing radio emission correspond to @xmath4 and @xmath340  kpc .",
    "again there is the possibility that the radio emission at intermediate size scales is produced by star - formation , or jet activity or a combination of both .",
    "similar arguments for the core are used to discuss the nature of the radio emission :    \\1 .",
    "the entirety of the missing flux is due to star - formation .",
    "following condon ( 1992 ) , the estimated sfrs are in the range @xmath68 ( see table  [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "this is only for massive stars , with masses @xmath69  m@xmath49 , so the total star - formation rates would be @xmath70 greater if integrated over a salpeter imf . thus , except in the cases of ams09 and ams21 ( and maybe ams15 ) , these are unphysically high sfrs .",
    "this is not surprising , since this sample was selected using a radio criterion to avoid contamination by luminous starbursts .",
    "thus , in the sample as a whole , it is extremely unlikely that the missing flux is all due to star - formation .",
    "if the missing flux is instead all due to agn jets , then the median jet luminosity is @xmath71  whz@xmath10sr@xmath10 , comparable to rqq , riq , and fr  i radio galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is most likely that the missing flux is dominated by emission from jets or lobes on physical scales @xmath4 , and @xmath340  kpc .",
    "for the sources ams09 , ams15 and ams21 , the missing flux suggest reasonable sfrs , indicating a significant contribution from star - formation can not be ruled out",
    ". however , the cores of all 3 objects are clearly agn dominated ( see section  [ sec : det ] ) . for the rest of the sample , although the extended emission is likely to be completely dominated by agn emission , it is not possible to rule out the additional presence and thus contribution of a powerful starburst .",

    "hence , as well as having similar recovered fractions to the rqq , there are hints that the obscured quasars show a slope more similar to the rqq than the fr  i or fr  ii sources .",
    "overall , the obscured quasars appear more similar to the rqq than any of the fr  i or fr  ii radio sources , although the errors in the small sample of objects observed in this paper are high .",
    "the observations are at a range of different frequencies , which have been converted to approximately 5  ghz ( rest - frame ) .",
    "the luminosities of obscured quasars are at @xmath82 , corresponding to around 5.8  ghz .",
    "this small difference is not important : the main result of figure  [ fig : fr12ul ] is that the sample of obscured quasars shows similar core - to - total luminosity ratios to the radio - quiet and radio - intermediate quasars ( as well as , for example , to mrk  231 ; ulvestad et al .",
    "1999 ; klckner et al .",
    "in these samples , the core emission reprents a large fraction of the total emission , whereas in fr  i and fr  ii sources , the total emission is typically @xmath331  dex greater than the core emission .    in the sample of obscured quasars ,",
    "typically @xmath160% of the flux is recovered on scales @xmath3 , and both flat - spectrum or inverted cores are inferred .",
    "the distributions of recovered fraction from the sample presented here and from the rqq sample of kukula et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) are indistinguishable . for many of the objects the physical scales",
    "are only constrained to be @xmath31  kpc . however , amongst their lowest - redshift sources ( @xmath83 ) the vla - a array resolution at 8.4  ghz is 0.24  arcseconds , which corresponds to @xmath1230  pc scales , and again the distribution of recovered fractions is similar to that of the @xmath0 obscured quasars .",
    "the main difference is that the typical spectral index inferred for the cores of kukula et  al .",
    "is @xmath10.7 .",
    "about half of the sample presented here has core spectral indices consistent with those of kukula et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , while the other half have inverted ( or , given the errors , possibly flat ) spectra .",
    "the rqq and seyferts show a correlation between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the obscured quasars have mid - infrared luminosities that correspond to unobscured quasars with estimated values of @xmath86 ( see ms06a and smith et  al .",
    "2009 ) , and radio luminosities at @xmath16  ghz of @xmath87 w hz@xmath10 sr@xmath10 . assuming @xmath88 and @xmath89 , for a given value of @xmath84 , the obscured quasars are @xmath12 dex more powerful in radio luminosity compared to the rqqs .",
    "this fits in with the results of figure  [ fig : fr12ul ] : the high - redshift obscured quasars have compact - to - total ratios similar to those of rqq , and extended emission on comparable scales , yet the rqq are significantly less powerful at radio frequencies .",
    "finally , given that the obscured quasars have radio luminosities corresponding to riq , and that @xmath140% of the flux density is in an extended component , it is clear that the majority of them are not beamed , and that their luminosity densities are intrinsic .",
    "a subsample of 11 high - redshift obscured quasars has been observed at 1.66  ghz with the evn , reaching a noise level of @xmath1  .",
    "the observations are sensitive to radio emission on physical scales @xmath3 .",
    "seven sources are securely detected and show compact radio emission .    amongst the detections , @xmath130100% of the entire flux density",
    "is recovered in the core . considering the luminosity densities and brightness temperatures , and comparing them to sne brightness temperatures as well as sfrs and molecular gas masses of extreme starbursts ,",
    "the cores are found to be agn - dominated and not due to a nuclear starburst . in the non - detections ,",
    "the limits inferred for the radio emission and inferred properties are similar to those of the detected cores .    comparing the total and core flux densities and spectral indices ,",
    "the sample is found to contain a mixture of steep - spectrum , gigahertz - peaked spectrum , compact steep spectrum and beamed sources .    when considering the evn observations , no correlations are found between the optical spectra and the recovered fraction .",
    "hence , there is no difference in the recovered fraction between host - obscured or torus - obscured quasars .",
    "indeed , no correlation is found either between the low - resolution spectral indices and the recovered fraction .",
    "this can be explained by the sample being composed of a mixture of steep - spectrum , compact - steep - spectrum , gigahertz - peaked and flat - spectrum sources .",
    "hence , the recovered fraction is related to the size and orientation of the jet rather than the distribution of the obscuring dust .    however , when considering the total ( low - resolution ) spectral indices and the core spectral indices , two sources are consistent with overall flat spectra due to a doppler - boosted radio core ( from a face - on jet , ams15 and ams19 ) . in the unified scheme ,",
    "only unobscured quasars are expected to show such flat spectra , but neither source shows either broad or narrow emission lines , despite being at redshifts where the rest - frame ultraviolet lines are observable .",
    "these two sources are candidates for `` host - obscured '' quasars , where the obscuring dust is distributed on @xmath1kpc scales , rather than in the torus of the unified scheme .    at the redshifts of the sources , the missing flux densities ( the emission ` resolved - out ' by the evn ) correspond to too high radio luminosities to be consistent with star - formation only in all but a few cases .",
    "the extended emission is therefore also interpreted as being dominated by radio emission from the lobes of jets , comparable in luminosity to those of riq and fr  i radio sources . however , a hybrid scenario with significant on - going star - formation can not be ruled out .    since the core and the extended emission are both agn - dominated ,",
    "the core and total luminosities of the sources are compared to those of other samples of agn : rqq , riq , rlq , fr  i and fr  iis . in particular , the total radio luminosities of the obscured quasars are comparable to those of fr  i and riq . the core - to - total luminosity ratios ( @xmath10.5 )",
    "are found to be more similar to those of rqq , rather than fr  i sources .",
    "indeed , the rqq studied by kukula et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) had a mean core - to - total luminosity fraction of 0.6 at 4.8  ghz .",
    "although , the cores of their rqq had typically steep spectral indices , whereas the high - redshift obscured quasars sometimes have inverted or flat cores .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that it is very difficult to assess the precise differences between rqq and fr  is when they have been observed with different interferometers and at different redshifts ; inverse - compton scattering against the cmb could extinguish old extended radio jets on larger scales in high redshift objects ( e.g. blundell and rawlings 2001 ) .",
    "the sample of obscured quasars have higher values of @xmath90 for an estimated @xmath84 , situating them in the riq regime rather than the rqq . yet ,",
    "their properties are more similar to those of rqq than to fr  i sources .",
    "these obscured riq have overall ( low - spatial resolution ) steep spectra , and @xmath140% of the flux is resolved out on @xmath4 scales , so that they are not all beamed rqq : they have intrinsically higher luminosities .",
    "the sources in our sample therefore reflect a gradual transition of intrinsic luminosities between the values observed for rlq and for rqq .",
