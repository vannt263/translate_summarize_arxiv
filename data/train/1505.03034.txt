    "since the striking idea of _ white dwarf _ by chandrasekhar @xcite the study of general relativistic compact objects received a tremendous thrust to carry out research in the field of ultra - dense objects .",
    "white dwarfs are composed of one of the densest forms of matter known , surpassed only by other compact stars such as neutron stars , quark stars / strange stars , boson stars , gravastars etc .    in the compact stars the matter is found to be in stable ground state where the quarks are confined inside the hadrons .",
    "if it is composed of the de - confined quarks then also a stable ground state of matter , known as ` strange matter ' , is achievable which provides a ` strange star ' @xcite . the main theoretical motivation for postulating the existence of strange stars was to explain the exotic phenomena of gamma ray bursts and soft gamma ray repeaters @xcite .",
    "on the observational side , the rossi x - ray timing explorer has now confirmed that @xmath0 is one of the candidates for a strange star @xcite .    as a start of the astrophysical objects of compact nature of the above kind",
    "the theoretical investigation has been done by several researchers by using both analytical and numerical methods . however , the density distribution inside the compact stars need not be isotropic and homogeneous as proposed in the tov model . in the early seventies ruderman @xcite has investigated the stellar models and argued that the nuclear matter may have anisotropic features at least in certain very high density ranges ( @xmath1gm / c.c . ) , where the nuclear interaction must be treated relativistically .",
    "later on bowers and liang @xcite gave emphasis on the importance of locally anisotropic equations of state for relativistic fluid spheres .",
    "they showed that anisotropy might have non - negligible effects on such parameters like maximum equilibrium mass and surface redshift .",
    "anisotropic matter distribution have been considered recently by several investigators as key feature in the configuration of compact stars ( with or without cosmological constant ) to model the objects physically more realistic  @xcite .    as one of the physical characteristics mak and harko",
    "@xcite have calculated the mass - radius ratio or compactness factor for compact relativistic star however in the presence of cosmological constant . to study mass and radii of neutron star egeland @xcite incorporated the existence of cosmological constant proportionality depending on the density of vacuum .",
    "kalam et al .",
    "@xcite by using their model calculated mass - radius ratio for strange star @xmath2 of their model and found it as @xmath3 which satisfies buchdahl s limit and corresponds to the same mass - radius ratio for the observed strange star @xmath2 .",
    "this physical aspect is very important because of the fact it helps to determine nature of the compact stars , its size , shape , matter contain and several other features .    now to get more information ,",
    "several studies have been done on charged or neutral fluid spheres with a spacetime geometry that admits a conformal symmetry , in the static as well as generalized non - static cases . in this line of conformal symmetry",
    "we note that there are lots of works available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , we investigate in the present work a new anisotropic star admitting non - static conformal symmetry ( mathematical formalism is provided in detail in the next sec .",
    "2 ) .    under this background and motivation",
    "we investigation in the present paper a model for relativistic compact star with anisotropy and find out exact spherically symmetric solutions which describe the interior of the dense star admitting non - static conformal symmetry .",
    "the scheme of this study is as follows : we provide mathematical formalism for non - static conformal motion in sec . 2 whereas the einstein field equations for anisotropic stellar source are given in sec .",
    "3 . the solutions and general features of the field equations under the dev - gleiser energy - density profile",
    "have been found out in sec .",
    "4 along with a special discussion on two prescriptions , in section 5 , viz .",
    "( _ 5.1 _ ) the misner prescription , and ( _ 5.2 _ ) the dev - gleiser prescription are done to show that mass to size ratio clearly indicates that the model represents a quark / strange compact star . in sec .",
    "6 we have made some concluding remarks .",
    "now , we consider the interior of a star under conformal motion through non - static conformal killing vector as @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the lie derivative operator , @xmath6 is the four vector along which the derivative is taken , @xmath7 is the conformal factor and @xmath8 are the metric potentials @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that for @xmath9 , the equation above yields the killing vector , whereas for @xmath10 corresponds to the homothetic vector .",
    "so , in general for @xmath11 we obtain conformal vectors . in this manner",
    ", one can perform a more general study of the spacetime geometry by using conformal killing vector .",
    "the static spherically symmetric spacetime is given by the line element ( with @xmath12 in geometrized units ) @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the metric potentials and functions of radial coordinate @xmath16 only .",
    "the proposed charged fluid spacetime is mapped conformally onto itself along the direction @xmath6 . here following herrera et al .",
    "@xcite we assume @xmath6 as non - static but @xmath7 to be static as follows : @xmath17    @xmath18    the above set of equations ( 1)-(4 ) give the following expressions @xcite for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath7 and @xmath21 :    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25 , \\label{eq8}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are arbitrary constants . according to maartens and maharaj @xcite one can set @xmath30 and @xmath31 so that by rescalling we can get @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35 . \\label{eq12}\\ ] ]    however , one can note that the above considerations , i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath31 , do not loss any generality .",
    "this is because the rescalling @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the following manner , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , leaves eq .",
    "( 1 ) invariant .",
    "in the present investigation we consider the most general energy - momentum tensor compatible with spherically symmetry in the following form : @xmath38 with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the matter density , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are radial and the transverse pressures of the fluid respectively .    for the metric given in eq .",

    "now our task is to find out solutions for the above set of the modified einstein equation in terms of the conformal motion . however , to do so we would like to study the following case for specific energy density as proposed by dev and gleiser @xcite for stars with the energy density in the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are constants .",
    "it is to be noted that the choice of the values for @xmath50 and @xmath51 is dictated by the physical configuration under consideration , e.g. @xmath52 and @xmath53 , corresponds to a relativistic fermi gas for ultradense cores of neutron stars @xcite whereas the values @xmath52 and @xmath54 represent a relativistic fermi gas with core immersed in a constant density background @xcite .",
    "it can easily be observed from eq .",

    "it is negative like exotic matter in nature , however , later we will see that all energy conditions are satisfied for real matter situation .          for the model under consideration the measure of anisotropy in pressures can be obtained , from eqs .",

    "as sound speeds lie between @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we should have @xmath97 as evident from fig . 10 .",

    "10 indicates that there is a change of sign for the term @xmath98 within the specific configuration and thus confirming that the model has a transition from unstable to stable configuration .",
    "the present stellar model gradually gets stability with the increase of the radius .",

    "in the investigations we have observed some interesting points which are as follows :    \\(1 ) note that though transverse pressure is negative , however , all energy conditions are satisfied .",

    "\\(2 ) it is observed that the transverse sound velocity is negative ( due to negative transverse pressure ) so that we use numerical value .",

    "on the other hand , bhmer and harko @xcite argued that for an anisotropic star in the presence of a cosmological constant the surface redshift must obey the general restriction @xmath120 , which is consistent with the bound @xmath121 as obtained by ivanov  @xcite .",

    "\\(7 ) for an overall view of the present study and also to have a physically viable model we put here the data which are available on some compact stars , e.g. @xmath2 and @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( see table 1 of the ref .",

    "we can conclude that our model represents a star with moderate compactness and also indicates that the star might be a compact star of strange / quark type rather than neutron star .",
