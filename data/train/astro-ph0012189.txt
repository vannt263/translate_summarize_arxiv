    "deimos ( the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ) is intended for imaging and multislit spectroscopy over a field of view that is approximately a rectangle of size 16 by 5. at the heart of deimos is a massive 9-element refractive camera , with three aspherical surfaces and the largest piece of caf@xmath4 ever cast ( 13.5 \" diameter ) .",
    "the focal plane of the camera is an 8k - by-8k pixel array of eight 2k - by-4k ccds manufactured by the mit lincoln laboratory , with 15@xmath5 ( 0.119 arcsec ) pixels .",
    "the rms image diameter of the spectrograph itself is @xmath6 , or 0.21 arcsec .",
    "we have in hand a full complement of thinned ccds , and we expect to soon have a full array of high resistivity @xmath7thick ccds , which have much enhanced qe beyond 9000 @xmath8 and less fringing than the thin chips .",
    "deimos is too massive for the cassegrain focus and will reside on a nasmyth deck of the keck - ii telescope , but since the field rotates as the telescope tracks across the sky , deimos must rotate along its long axis . changing gravitational forces",
    "will inevitably cause any instrument to flex , but maintaining constant wavelength to pixel registration is essential for careful flat fielding and sky subtraction .",
    "deimos has been designed with an active 2-d flexure compensation system in which a tent mirror and the x - coordinate of the detector package can be slightly adjusted by means of a closed - cycle feedback loop .",
    "the goal is for the wavelength  to  pixel registration within deimos to be held to within 0.1 pixel rms for long periods of time , hopefully obviating the need to take extensive calibrations frequently .",
    "deimos is being built as a facility instrument for keck and will have a grating slide with room for three diffraction gratings plus a mirror for imaging .",
    "the slit masks are stored in a juke - box with room for 13 separate masks .",
    "the masks are thin aluminum plates in which slitlets will be cut by a computer controlled milling machine .",
    "these slits can be tilted to follow the major axis of target galaxies , so as to facilitate measurement of rotation curves .",
    "the masks are stored flat but upon insertion they are bent to a cylindrical shape that closely approximates the spherical focal plane of keck .",
    "once deimos is operational , we shall commence deep2 , a survey of faint galaxies designed to characterize galaxies and the galaxy distribution at a redshift @xmath9 .",
    "( deep1 is the project described by koo at this meeting . )",
    "the deep2 goal is to generate a sample of uniform quality data with a well defined selection criterion that will be suitable for many different analyses .",
    "this is a collaborative project amongst astronomers at uc , caltech , and the univ of hawaii , in addition to outside collaborators .",
    "team members with keck access are m. davis , s. faber , d. koo , r. guhathakurta , c. steidel , r. ellis , j. luppino , and n. kaiser .",
    "this program will use 120 keck nights over a three year period .",
    ".fields selected for the deep2 survey [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the deep2 survey will be undertaken in four fields , as listed in table 1 .",
    "the fields were chosen as low extinction zones that are continuously observable at favorable zenith angle from hawaii over a six month interval .",
    "one field is the groth survey strip , which has good hst imaging and which will be the target of very deep ir imaging by sirtf , and two of the fields are on the equatorial strip that will be deeply surveyed by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) project @xcite .",
    "each of these fields is the target of a cfht imaging survey by luppino and kaiser , whose primary goal is very deep imaging for weak lensing studies . they are using the new uh camera ( 8k by 12k pixels ) with a field of view of 30 by 40 in the b , r , and i bands .",
    "the imaging will be obtained in random pointings spread over a field of @xmath10 by @xmath10 , but with continuous coverage of a strip of length @xmath11 by @xmath12 in the center of each field .    given this enormous photometric database ,",
    "we shall use the color information to select galaxies with @xmath1 .",
    "deimos will then be used to undertake a spectroscopic survey of galaxies with @xmath13 and meeting our color criteria . at this relatively bright flux limit",
    ", 60% of the galaxies will have @xmath14 @xcite ; the photometric redshift preselection eliminates this foreground subsample , allowing the deep2 project to focus its effort on the high - redshift universe .",
    "we anticipate that the workhorse grating for the deep2 survey will be the 900 lines / mm grating , which has an anamorphic factor of 1.4 .",
    "this grating will provide spectral coverage of 3500 @xmath8 in one setting .",
    "if we use slits of width 0.75 \" , they will project to a size of 4.6 pixels , or a wavelength interval of 2 @xmath8 .",
    "thus the resolving power of the observations will be quite high , @xmath15 .",
    "the mit - ll ccds have exceptionally low readout noise , 1 - 2 @xmath16 , and the time to become sky - noise limited is less than 10 minutes , even when using the 1200 l / mm grating .",
    "the large number of pixels in the dispersion direction allows high resolution with substantial spectral range , so that we can work between the bright oh sky emission lines while remaining sky - noise limited .",
    "we will set the grating tilt so that the region 6000 - 9000 @xmath8 is centered on the detector , thus assuring that the 3727 @xmath8 [ oii ] doublet is in range for galaxies with @xmath17 . at the planned spectral resolution",
    ", the velocity resolution will be 80 km / s .",
    "the [ oii ] doublet will thus be resolved for all the galaxies , giving confidence to the redshift determination even if no other features are observed . with sufficient flux",
    "it should be possible to measure the velocity broadening of the lines , which will hopefully lead to an estimate of the gravitational potential - well depth of a substantial fraction of the galaxies within the survey .      in each of the four selected fields of table 1",
    ", we shall densely target a region of 120 by 16 or 120 by 30 for deimos spectroscopy .",
    "we intend to produce 120 separate masks per field ; each mask will each contain slitlets selected from a region of size 16 by 4 , with the slitlets mostly aligned along the long axis , but with others tilted as much as @xmath18 to track extended galaxies .",
    "our goal is to select an average of 130 slitlets per mask , selected from the those galaxies meeting our flux and color cuts .",
    "the mean surface density of candidate galaxies exceeds the number of objects we can select by approximately 30% , and spectra of selected targets can not be allowed to overlap .",
    "however , this will not cause problems with subsequent analyses if we take account of the positions of those galaxies for which we did not obtain spectroscopy . in the groth strip region , because of the interests of other collaborative scientific projects , our plan is to construct 120 distinct masks each offset from their neighbor by 1 , and to select targets without regard to color .",
    "thus , any spot on the sky will be found within 4 masks , giving every galaxy 4 chances to appear on a mask without conflict . in the other three survey fields , we plan to use the color selection , thus halving the source density of targets , and to step 2 between masks , giving a galaxy two chances to be selected without conflict . in these fields",
    "the masks will form a pattern of 60 by 2 , covering a field of 120 by 30. at @xmath2 , this field subtends a comoving interval of @xmath19 mpc@xmath20 , and our redshift range translates to a comoving interval of @xmath21 mpc ( flat universe with @xmath22 ) .",
    "note that this survey differs from the planned vlt / virmos survey @xcite in that a deimos spectrum will occupy a full row of the ccd array ( 8k pixels ) , so the vlt / virmos multiplexing will be higher than ours .",
    "the deep2 spectra will have resolution 20 times higher than planned for the bulk of the vlt / virmos project , but our volume surveyed will be smaller ( partially because we are excluding objects with @xmath14 ) .",
    "the deep2 project is actually subdivided into two surveys , the 1hs ( one hour [ integration time ] survey ) and the 3hs ( three hour survey ) .",
    "the 1hs is the backbone of the deep2 project and will require 90 nights on keck for execution .",
    "the planned large scale structure studies are the main drivers of the 1hs design",
    ". the 3hs will require 30 nights of keck time to obtain spectra of @xmath23 targets .",
    "the major scientific focus of the 3hs is to study the properties of galaxies , but it will also serve a critical role of checking the quality of linewidths and other properties derived from 1hs spectra .",
    "3hs targets will be selected to a flux limit up to one magnitude fainter than the 1hs .",
    "the 3hs survey fields will be limited to a few 16 by 4 regions , plus one field 16 by 16 in the center of the groth survey zone .",
    "we intend to acquire hst imaging in all 3hs fields , as well as chandra and xmm images",
    ".      the data rate from deimos will be in excess of 1 gbyte / hour , so automated reduction and analysis tools are absolutely imperative .",
    "we have been working closely with the sdss team and intend to adapt the idl code of schlegel and burles for our pipeline reduction .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic databases for the project are currently planned to be idl structures , stored on disk as fits binary tables .",
    "although the total raw data will exceed one tbyte , the reduced data will be modest in size by today s standards , @xmath24 gbytes .",
    "the 1hs survey is designed to provide a fair sample volume for analysis of lss statistical behavior , particularly for clustering studies on scales @xmath25 mpc .",
    "the comoving volume surveyed in the 1hs program will exceed that of the lcrs survey @xcite , a survey which has proven to be an outstanding resource for low redshift studies of lss .",
    "when the data is in hand , we plan a number of scientific analyses , with major programs listed below .",
    "* characterize the linewidths and spectral properties of galaxies versus color , luminosity , redshift , and other observables .",
    "the 3hs is designed to reach to a depth to allow more detailed analysis of the internal properties of galaxies at high redshift , including rotation curves , linewidths from absorption spectra , and stellar populations .",
    "* precisely measure the two  point and three  point correlation functions of galaxies at @xmath9 as a function of other observables , such as color , luminosity , or linewidth . for the higher  order correlations ,",
    "dense sampling is essential .",
    "observations of lyman limit galaxies at @xmath26 @xcite show that the bias in the galaxy distribution was considerably higher in the past .",
    "higher order correlations in the galaxy distribution are one way to estimate the presence of bias in the galaxy distribution @xcite . if the galaxy bias is larger at @xmath9 than at present , the correlation strength of different subsamples of galaxies should show more systematic variation than is observed for galaxies at @xmath27 .",
    "* measure redshift space distortions in the galaxy clustering at @xmath9 by means of the @xmath28 diagram and by other measures .",
    "the evolution of the thermal velocity dispersion is another handle that can separate the evolution of the galaxy bias from the evolution of the underlying matter distribution .",
    "the redshift precision afforded by the resolution of deimos will make this measurement possible . * count galaxies as a function of redshift and linewidth , in order to execute the classical redshift - volume cosmological test .",
    "details are given by @xcite who show that this test can provide a precision measurement of the cosmological parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "if instead one assumes the universe to be flat , the test can set a strong constraint on the equation of state parameter @xmath31 of the dark energy component , in which @xmath32 @xcite * separate the alcock - paczynski effect @xcite,@xcite from the redshift space distortions of the @xmath28 diagram .",
    "this effect relates intervals of angular separation versus intervals of redshift separation as a function of redshift .",
    "an object that appears spherical at low redshift would appear elongated in redshift at @xmath33 , but the degree of elongation is a function of @xmath34 .",
    "this effect is 10 times smaller in amplitude than the redshift - volume effect and will be challenging to measure , but it is conceivable that the deep2 project will provide data that can measure this effect and separate it from the other expected redshift space distortions .",
    "the flood of data now coming from the sdss and 2df projects detailing the local universe will soon be complemented by data from the vlt / virmos project and by the deep2 survey providing detailed information on the universe at @xmath2 , thus continuing the revolution in precision cosmology and large - scale structure .",
    "we intend to share our results with the public and to put our spectra online in a timely manner .",
    "further details on the survey can be found at the web site http://astro.berkeley.edu / deep/. the coming years promise to be extraordinarily busy for us , but very exciting .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grants ast00 - 71048 and ast95 - 29028 .",
    "the deimos spectrograph is funded by a grant from cara ( keck observatory ) , by an nsf facilities and infrastructure grant ( ast92 - 2540 ) , by the center for particle astrophysics , and by gifts from sun microsystems and gifts from sun microsystems and the quantum corporation .",
