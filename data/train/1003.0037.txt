    "electron spins in confined nanostructures show promise as a basis for quantum information processing.@xcite among the realizations of spin qubits , gated carbon nanotubes offer a number of attractive features , including large confinement energy and a nearly nuclear - spin - free environment . a novel circumferential spin - orbit coupling in nanotubes , mediated by _ s - p _ hybridization and inversely proportional in strength to the nanotube radius , has been investigated experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite recently . in this paper",
    ", we show that circumferential spin - orbit coupling provides a natural means of creating a strong spatial dependence of the magnitude and direction of the effective magnetic field experienced by a spin qubit formed by confining charge in a nanotube . along bends in the nanotube , the spin qubit couples efficiently to electrostatic gates , allowing spin control and spin - spin coupling , while along straight regions the spin qubit is insensitive to electric fields and is therefore inactive and protected .",
    "related effects of bending modes on spin relaxation have also been considered recently .",
    "@xcite    [ fig1 ]    the spin , or quantum two - level system , that forms the physical qubit is a kramers doublet in a nanotube quantum dot containing an odd number of electrons , in the low - magnetic - field regime . as illustrated in fig .  1",
    ", splitting of these doublets in a magnetic field depends on the direction of the field with respect to the nanotube axis .",
    "this is the key observation of our analysis : in tubes with bends , the angle between the tube axis and the applied magnetic field depends on position along the tube .",
    "this dependence couples position and spin , allowing electric fields to control spin and create spin - spin coupling . in straight segments , changes in position",
    "do not change the angle between the field and the nanotube axis , and so this coupling vanishes . for use as a qubit , relaxation of the low - field kramers doublet",
    "is suppressed due to time - reversal symmetry , in contrast to the qubit formed at the high - field crossing@xcite ( at 1.4 t in fig .  1 ) ,",
    "consistent with experiment.@xcite",
    "we start by analyzing the spectrum of a quantum dot confined along a bend in a nanotube .",
    "the geometry of the system can be described in terms of local ( primed ) coordinates , @xmath0 , perpendicular to the nanotube axis , and @xmath1 along the nanotube axis ( see fig .",

    "the first two terms describe the two kramers doublets , while the last term describes the coupling to magnetic fields of spin and orbital moments .",
    "note that orbital moments are always along the nanotube axis unit vector @xmath10 .",
    "we consider only planar devices with magnetic fields applied in plane of the bent nanotube , but this restriction can be readily generalized to bends and fields out of the plane .    the magnetic field dependence of a nanotube quantum dot , including effects of spin - orbit coupling , is shown in fig .  1 for typical parameters for small - gap semiconducting nanotubes .",
    "two parameters characterizing the nanotube device are the spin - orbit energy scale , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , which characterizes the mixing of @xmath13 and @xmath14 valleys due to disorder on length scales comparable to or smaller than the nanotube radius , @xmath15 .",

    "a notable feature of the coat hanger geometry is that the electron spends nearly all of its time  including during rotation  in straight regions of the tube , where stray electric fields do not cause inadvertent qubit rotation ; only during the brief non - adiabatic passage from one straight region to another is the qubit on a bend and therefore sensitive to decoherence due to electrical noise . a single bend ( as in fig .",
