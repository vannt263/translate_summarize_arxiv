    "the oldest stellar populations in galaxies offer clues to the earliest epochs of galaxy formation .",
    "the nature of halo stellar populations , detailed structures , and kinematics are clues to the understanding of how galaxies have assembled their mass .",
    "much of what we know about such early populations comes from detailed studies of the stellar halo of the milky way .",
    "however , remarkably little is known about the stellar halos of other spiral galaxies , and their formation histories .    based on the analysis of chemical , kinematic , and structural properties of the galaxy halo stellar populations ,",
    "two canonical scenarios of halo formation and evolution were proposed .",
    "the monolithic collapse scenario was proposed by eggen , lyden - bell , & sandage ( 1962 ) , in which the stellar halo is formed by a rapid collapse of the proto - galaxy , within a time on order of the dynamical timescale ( @xmath0yr ) .",
    "the second scenario was proposed by searle & zinn ( 1978 ) in which the halo is formed within a longer timescale ( @xmath1yr ) by accretion of protogalactic fragments that underwent separate pre - enrichment .",
    "the recently identified streams in halos of different galaxies ( the galaxy : yanny et al .",
    "2000 ; m  31 : ibata et al . 2001 ; ngc  5128 : peng et al . 2002 ) give credence to the idea that halo populations are affected by infall / accretion of dwarfs ( ferguson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however neither of these scenarios account qualitatively and quantitatively for the accumulated constraints on the properties of the milky way stellar halo , and both of them have several difficulties in explaining the observed properties of the galaxy halo stars ( norris & ryan 1991 ; beers & sommer - larsen 1995 ; chiba & beers 2000 ) ; it is yet unclear which framework may describe accurately the formation and the evolution of the galaxy halo .",
    "the failure of these models suggested hybrid scenarios . in those scenarios , the flattened distribution of stars at the inner part of the milky way results from dissipative collapse of large gas clouds similar to the eggen et al .",
    "scenario , while the outer galaxy spheroid region originates from dissipationless accretion of dwarf - like fragments ( freeman 1996 ; carney et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the main conclusion drawn from the comparison between the milky way and m  31 ( durrell et al . 2001 ) halo star properties is that the galaxy halo may not be typical : the halos of spiral galaxies seem to be quite diverse .",
    "the physical processes thay may regulate this diversity are still very unclear ( see bekki & chiba 2001 for a discussion of this issue on the framework of cold dark matter models ) .    a key quantity that helps disentangle the formation history of the stellar halo is the metallicity distribution function of galactic halo stars . for stellar populations older than about 1 gyr",
    ", the location of red giant stars on the color - magnitude diagram is predominantly sensitive to metallicity rather than age , so a first - approximation metallicity distribution can be constructed through stellar photometry .",
    "this approach was extensively used , both from ground - based and hubble space telescope ( hst ) deep photometry , to construct the metallicity distribution of nearby galaxies .",
    "only a few galaxies beyond the local group have measured metallicity distributions , e.g. ngc  5128 ( harris & harris 2002 ) and ngc  3379 ( gregg et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "in this paper we report the results from the observations of resolved stars in halos of a sample of nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "the photometry is used to construct the metallicity distributions of halo stellar populations .",
    "the main aim here is to study the global properties of population ii halos in normal spirals , to seek correlations between galactic properties and halo stellar populations and structures .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in   [ data ] we present our data set , in ",
    "[ analysis ] we present the methodology and the ingredients we used to construct the metallicity distribution , and present the properties of the observed halo fields , metallicity distributions , and discussions of our results .",
    "finally , in   [ concl ] the results of the present work are summarized , and their implications for the formation and evolution of galactic halos are discussed .",
    "the galaxy selection criteria , observations and the reduction techniques applied to our sample of highly inclined spiral galaxies have been described in mouhcine et al .",

    "( 2004a ) are shown in fig.[field_loc ] .",
    "the observed fields are located so as to avoid contamination from the outer bulge and/or the disk , and to sample a pure halo stellar population . exposure times through the f814w filter were set to reach a signal - to - noise of 5 in the wf camera for an absolute magnitude @xmath2 ( for galaxies with @xmath3 ) or @xmath4 for more distant ones .",
    "the f606w exposure times were set to reach the same s / n at the same absolute magnitude for metal - poor rgb stars .",
    "the images were reduced using the standard hst pipeline , and employing the latest flatfield observations and using contemporaneous super - dark reference frames .",
    "the dithered frames were combined with iterative cosmic ray rejection using software in the stsdas.dither package based on the drizzle algorithm of fruchter and hook ( 2002 ) .",
    "the stellar magnitudes were measured through circular apertures with a radius of @xmath5 .",
    "these aperture magnitudes were corrected to total magnitudes using tinytim model ( krist 2004 ) point - spread functions .",
    "aperture - corrections and zeropoints are applied separately for each ccd chip .",
    "the charge - transfer inefficiency has been corrected using the latest version of the dolphin ( 2002 ) equations .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were transformed to standard v and i magnitudes following the prescription of holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . after correcting for the foreground extinction",
    ", we have estimated the magnitudes in the standard photometric system using the instrumental magnitudes and solving the equations relating the wfpc2-to - vi magnitudes using the coefficients tabulated by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . as the focus of this paper is to derive the abundance distributions from a star - by - star analysis ,",
    "sources of contamination and error must be understood and controlled .",
    "one of the factors that could influence the color width of the red giant branch , and thus affect the measurement of the stellar metallicities , are the photometric errors .",
    "the photometric errors may introduce a broadening of the red giant branch sequence that may be interpreted as indicative of a physical metallicity distribution function .",
    "photometric incompleteness may mask the presence of extremely red stellar populations . in order to assess these effects",
    ", we carried out a large number of artificial star experiments , evaluating the photometric scatter and completeness as a function of magnitude . in each simulation , stars were added to the original images , with input colors and magnitudes following a narrow red giant branch sequence .",
    "the locations of stars in each frame were chosen randomly , so that over different experiments the added stars were uniformly distributed over the whole frame .",
    "the images were then reduced following the same procedure used for the original frames . because the incompleteness varies as a function of i and (",
    "v - i ) ( and on the chip ) , we have mapped out the completeness using linear interpolation between the grid points sampled in the artificial star experiments .",
    "we have used this to assign to each star a completeness fraction . in practice",
    ", we compute the completeness in terms of the instrumental magnitudes and then translate them through the photometric calibration equations into the completeness in terms of standand magnitudes for each point in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the depth of the images vary from galaxy to galaxy , with @xmath6 completeness limits ranging from absolute magnitudes @xmath7 to @xmath8 . to assess the accuracy of our photometry",
    ", we calculate the difference between the input and recovered magnitude for each magnitude bin .",
    "the photometric errors at an absolute magnitude @xmath9 range from @xmath10 mag in the best case ( ngc  55 ) to @xmath11 mag in the worst case ( ngc  4258 ) .    for the purpose of deriving the metallicity distribution for stellar halos",
    ", the completeness effects may be large for extremely red and bright giant stars at the upper right corner of a color - magnitude diagram near the completeness cutoff determined by the v - filter ; those stars are likely to have solar or super - solar abundances . for nearly all sample galaxies ,",
    "apart from ngc  4258 , the @xmath6 completeness limit falls well below the brightest end of the red giant branch . in our analysis of the metallicity distribution",
    ", we include the effects of incompleteness as far as the data allow .",
    "contamination by foreground galactic stars may be important , especially for the ngc  4945 halo field because of its low galactic latitude and the deep photometry . to estimate galactic foreground contamination",
    ", we used the besanon group model of stellar population synthesis of the galaxy available through the web@xmath12 ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) , simulating the total number and optical photometry of foreground stars .",
    "we found that galactic field star contamination contributes only @xmath13 at the maximum , in the case of ngc  4945 , within the magnitude ranges used to construct the metallicity distribution functions and @xmath14 .",
    "a few faint background galaxies may have misclassified as stars .",
    "an upper limit to the contamination can be estimated from the hubble deep fields ( catalogs described in casertano et al . , 2000 ) , which have the same area as the fields we have observed . in the hdf - n we find 10 sources with @xmath15 and @xmath16 arcsec . in the hdf - s",
    "there are 22 such sources . some of these are galactic foreground stars .",
    "thus the level of compact - source contamination is entirely negligible .",
    "the morphological type , disk inclination , integrated magnitude , foreground extinction , and true distance modulus of each galaxy in the sample are listed in table[gal_prop ] .",
    "extinction- and inclination - corrected v - band magnitudes come from rc3 .",
    "no significant internal extinction is expected to affect the halo stellar populations , as halo regions are most likely dust free .",
    "the reddening toward the halo fields was estimated using the all - sky map of schlegel et al .",
    "we adopt the relations @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the used hst filters .",
    "we have neglected the effect of any possible differential reddening across our fields and along the line of sight .",
    "indeed , the differential reddening due to the galactic foreground across the wfpc2 fields is likely to be small .",
    "the locations of the observed halo field are shown fig.[field_loc ] , on the digitized sky survey image of the galaxies that were not discussed in paper i , i.e. , ngc  55 , ngc  247 , nc  300 , and ngc  3031 .    as demonstrated extensively in the literature , the tip of the red giant branch is a useful distance indicator ( lee et al .",
    "1993 ) . the i - band luminosity function can be used to identify the magnitude level of the tip of the red giant branch , and thus the distance modulus to our sample galaxies .",

    ", they found a satisfactory agreement between the metallicities derived from the interpolation within the vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) model grid and the literature metallicities . however , at intermediate metallicities , i.e. , @xmath56\\sim\\,-0.7}$ ] , the agreement is poorer .",
    "the estimated metallicity of the milky way globular cluster 47  tuc from the interpolation within the model grid is lower than the literature value by @xmath57 dex , on the order of the observed systematic difference between halo star mean metallicities from the metallicity distribution functions and those from the red giant branch star colors at a luminosity of @xmath58 ( that we repored in paper ii ) .",
    "the mean colors of the observed red giant branchs of bright galaxies in our sample agree well with the red giant branch sequence of 47  tuc as shown in fig.[galcmd1 ] .",
    "thus , the shift between the two mean metallicities of bright galaxy halo stars is due to the fact that the vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) models predict a redder red giant branch sequence than the observed one at the 47  tuc metallicity .",
    "thus , if metal rich stars ( @xmath38\\ga\\-0.7}$ ] ) are present , the mean stellar halo metallicities derived from the colors of red giant branch stars at a luminosity of @xmath58 may be a bit more reliable than these derived from the mean of the metallicity distribution functions .    inspecting the metallicity distribution functions ,",
    "a number of common features emerge .",
    "the overall shape for all metallicity distribution functions is similar ; they are characterized by prominent peaks at the metal - rich end with extended metal - poor tails .",
    "the figures show that the position of the dominant peak is a function of the parent galaxy luminosity : the brighter the galaxy , the higher the metallicity of the prominent peak of the halo metallicity distribution function .",
    "the i - band magnitude range selected to construct the metallicity distribution functions of ngc  253 and ngc  4945 stellar halos should allow us to detect stars with metallicities up to solar .",
    "if super - solar stars are present in the halos of these galaxies , we might be missing them .",
    "the sharp cut - off of the metallicity distribution function at the high metallicity end appears to be real , instead of an effect of the photometric incompleteness or another observational artifact .",
    "the evolutionary tracks with metallicities in the range @xmath59\\le 0 $ ] are above the magnitude range where the incompleteness starts to be severe . the only galaxy for which the sharp cut - off of the metallicity distribution function at the high metallicity end could be due to observational effects is ngc  4258 .",
    "the metal - rich end of the metallicity distribution function of this galaxy is suspected to be incomplete , i.e. , a fraction of metal - rich stars are missing .",
    "for this galaxy , the photometry does not probe the red giant branch far , and the 50% completeness level limit falls close to the brightest end of the rgb sequence .",
    "we have limited ourselves to a range of i - band magnitudes where the completeness level is not severely low .",
    "however , stars with metallicities higher than @xmath38\\sim\\,-0.7}$ ] lie at fainter magnitudes than the magnitude range chosen to construct the metallicity distribution function of ngc  4258 halo stars .",
    "if the halo of this galaxy contains metal - rich stars , we might be missing a fraction of them .",
    "similar features are seen for the metallicity distribution functions of both m  31 ( durrell et al . 2001 , 2004 ) and ngc  5128 ( harris & harris 2000 ) , i.e. , prominent metal - rich peak , metal - poor tail , and a sharp metal - rich end .",
    "the metallicity distribution function of the galaxy stellar halo is distinct from those of our galaxy sample and from m  31 and ngc  5128 , suggesting again that the halo of the galaxy is not typical for a luminous ( spiral ) galaxy ( see also mouhcine et al .",
    "2004b ) .",
    "the most straightforward models of stellar population enrichment considers the closed box evolution of a homogeneous proto - galactic gas cloud having initial abundance @xmath60 . as time advances ,",
    "the gas is consumed to form stars , and more massive stars , that evolve rapidly , return a fraction of their mass , enriched in metals due to the nucleosynthesis , to the gas cloud .",
    "the instantaneous recycling approximation neglects the lifetime of stars that contribute to the chemical enrichment compared to any timescale of the system , and assumes complete and homogeneous ejecta mixing ( searle & sargent 1972 ; pagel & patchett 1975 ) .",
    "the simple model assumes that no infall and/or outflow of metals has occured during the star forming phase of the system .",
    "the stellar yield , defined as the ratio of the mass of new metals ejected to the mass locked into long - lived stars and remnants , parametrizes the model . under these assumptions ,",
    "the stellar metallicity distribution follows the simple law :    @xmath61\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 is the stellar yield .",
    "the yield and the mean abundance @xmath63 are related via : @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the initial metallicity .",
    "hence , the yield is the average metallicity of the stars in a one - zone system following the exhaustion of the gas ( hartwick 1976 ) . if metals are lost from the system by gas outflow , assuming that the gas loss rate is proportional to the star formation rate , the functional form of the metallicity distribution is unchanged , but the true yield is reduced to the effective yield @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a parameter related to the gas loss rate ( for a detailed discussion , see binney & merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "the only two free parameters of the model are the mean metallicity of the stellar population and the initial abundance of the protogalactic gas . in the following",
    ", we will assume that the initial star formation event has consumed a primordial heavy element - free gas , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "the agreement between the observed galaxy luminosity - stellar halo metallicity and the expected scaling from dekel & silk ( 1986 ) , where the chemical evolution of the protogalaxy is approximated by this simple model , suggests that it may also provide a convenient approximation of the metallicity distribution of halo stars ( see mouhcine et al .",
    "2004b ) .",
    "fig.[mdf_mdl1 ] and fig.[mdf_mdl2 ] show the simple chemical model predictions , with the choice of the effective yield as indicated in each panel , overplotted on top of the observed metallicity distribution function .",
    "the photometric uncertainties for the stars considered here are small ( see fig .",
    "[ galcmd1 ] and fig .",
    "[ galcmd2 ] ) , and the models have not been smoothed .",
    "fig.[mdf_lin1 ] and fig.[mdf_lin2 ] show the same models and the same data on a linear metallicity scale .",
    "as the simple chemical model satisfies the requirement of a probability distribution , the model predictions are scaled by the area under the data histogram , so that the area covered by the data and fits are identical .",
    "it is has to be mentioned that by comparing the observed metallicity distribution to the simple chemical model predictions , we implicitly assume that galaxies are built up within a single potential well .",
    "the figures show that the simple chemical models grossly reproduce the general shape of the estimated metallicity distribution function .",
    "the number of observed stars at the low metallicity end continues to rise as the metallicity decreases as required by the model .",
    "the effective yields needed to reproduce the metallicity distribution functions are a function of the parent galaxy luminosity .",
    "the effective yield values needed to get an agreement with the observed metallicity distribution of bright galaxies are similar to those needed to fit the metallicity distribution functions of the m  31 halo ( durrell et al .",
    "2001 ) , and ngc  5128 ( harris & harris 2000 ) , but much larger than the best value for the galaxy halo .    despite the success of the simple chemical model to reproduce , in broad terms , the metallicity distributions , there are , however , noticeable deviations , especially when bright galaxies are considered .",
    "the simple model predicts that the subsolar regime ( @xmath69 ) is more populated than what is observed , deviating from the exponential - decay condition . on the other hand , the number of stars in the intermediate metallicity regime ( @xmath70 ) ,",
    "is underestimated by the simple chemical evolution models .",
    "quite striking is that the observed metallicity distribution is significantly narrower than the simple chemical model predictions . at near - solar metallicity",
    ", a star excess is predicted , and a sharp cut - off is generally missed by the models .",
    "as discussed above , this sharp cut - off is real ; it may be even sharper given that any observational bias can only smooth out , and then broaden , any sharp feature in the metallicity distribution .",
    "this relative lack of metal poor stars is evident for the halo of m31 , where it is possible to reach fainter than the horizontal branch . the metal poor fraction , as evidenced by the fraction of blue hb stars , is @xmath71 ( bellazini et al .",
    "what kind of stellar halo formation scenario can account for the new observations ?",
    "a key element to understanding the formation of stellar halos can be found in the shape of their mdfs .",
    "the stellar halos of bright galaxies are dominated by a metal - rich stellar population .",
    "this implies that those galaxies underwent a large amount of chemical enrichement before the stellar halos were assembled , or that the halos were assembled from metal - rich satellites .",
    "hierarchical models of galaxy formation provide a reasonable picture of galaxy evolution .",
    "ct et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have discussed a model for the formation of a galactic spheroid , where it is assembled by dissipationless accretion of isolated , chemically distinct , small and metal - poor protogalactic fragments .",
    "these models are able to reproduce the metallicity distributions of both diffuse halo stars and halo globular cluster systems in both the galaxy and m  31 provided that the luminosity function of protogalactic fragments that were accreted to form the halo of m  31 is flatter than what is needed to reproduce the galaxy halo metallicity distributions . despite its success in accounting for the overall shape of the mdfs of m  31 and milky way stellar halos , this model has difficulties accounting for the large excess of stars at @xmath72 , i.e. , the peak of the metallicity distribution ( see also durrell et al .",
    "these stars are too metal - rich to be formed in a shallow potential well , i.e. , in a low - mass protogalactic fragment .",
    "the comparison between the observed stellar halo mdfs and those of dwarf galaxies , i.e. , ngc  147 and bk  5n in the m  81 group as given in harris & harris ( 2000 ) , show clearly that stellar halos contain a rather small number of metal - poor stars that dominate dwarf galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the stellar halos of spiral galaxies , at least the bright ones , have not been predominantly assembled from the disruption of metal - poor dwarf satellite galaxies similar to ones observed in the local group and m  81 galaxy group .",
    "the differences of chemical abundance ratios between galaxy halo stars and those of local group dwarf spheroidal galaxy stars seems to indicate that this may be also the case for the milky way stellar halo ( shetrone et al .",
    "2003 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "harris & harris ( 2001 ) have shown that ngc  5128 stellar halo mdf is statistically indistinguishable from the mdf of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) outer disk stars constructed using a sample of giant stars from cole et al.(2000 ) .",
    "the observed metallicity distributions of bright galaxy stellar halos share similarities with the metallicity distributions of both the inner region of the faint compact elliptical galaxy m  32 ( grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) and the lmc outer disk stars ( cole et al .",
    "2000 ) , i.e. , small number of metal - poor stars , and the predominance of @xmath41\\sim\\,-0.5}$ ] stars .",
    "these similarities suggest that at least a fraction of halo stars originates from the disruption of lmc - like galaxies .",
    "this is in agreement with the suggestion of ibata et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and harris & harris ( 2001 ) that the bulk of the halos of m  31 and ngc  5128 may have formed from a single event , such as the disruption of similar metal - rich stellar systems .",
    "yet another possibility is that the stars formed from gas which was pre - enriched by the formation of the spheroid .",
    "the high metallicity is suggestive of gas originating in violent starburst that may be connected with the formaton of the bulge .",
    "the sharp high - metallicity cutoff of the metallicity distribution , in comparison to the predictions of simple chemical evolution model , suggests that the star formation did not proceed to exhaust entirely the gas reservoir .",
    "if spiral stellar halos formed in a rapid and violent star - forming event , one may expect that a fraction of the heavy elements , produced by supernovae , are lost by means of metal - rich galactic winds before the metal - rich gas was exhausted by star formation .",
    "another possible way to produce the apparent pronounced peak in the metallicity distribution functions may be the presence of a large age spread for halo stellar populations",
    ". if metal - rich halo populations are significantly younger than halo metal - poor populations , metal - rich rgb stars will be bluer than they would be if they were old .",
    "thus , their metallicity will be systematically underestimated if the metallicity distribution functions are constructed following the assumption that halo field stars are uniformely old .",
    "deep observations of the m  31 stellar halo indicate the presence of an age spread larger than few gyr ( brown et al .",
    "unfortunately , no constraints are available on the age distributions of halo stellar populations for other galaxies .",
    "deep and wide field observations of stellar halos are needed to get insight into the age distribution of halo stellar populations over a significant fraction of the halo .",
    "the paucity of metal - poor stars compared to the simple chemical model predictions may flag the presence of a g - dwarf like problem , similar to what is observed for the galactic disk ( tinsley 1980 ) , and also possibly in the bulge ( zoccali et al .",
    "investigations of integrated light properties show that the g - problem is present in early type galaxies ( greggio 1997 ) .",
    "it is intriguing to see that stellar systems with different histories are sharing the same problem , the reason for which is not fully understood . for galactic stellar halos , pre - enrichment of the gas from which halo stars form can be invoked to explain the moderate number of metal - poor stars compared to the simple chemical model predictions .",
    "the closed - box chemical evolution model stands on the assumption that the gas mass is assembled entirely before the star formation starts , i.e. , no outflow or inflow .",
    "it is well established that the g - dwarf problem is eliminated if the baryonic matter assembly is assued to be gradual ( pagel 1997 ) .",
    "this suggests that stars which end up in the halo of spiral galaxies were formed gradually within their formation site(s ) .",
    "we have presented the results from a study of the stellar populations within the halos of spiral galaxies .",
    "the main goal of our study is to investigate the properties of spiral halos , and to deepen our understanding of the physical processes that govern their formation , and to shed light on the buildup of galaxies over the cosmic time .",
    "we have used wfpc2 to image in the f606w ( @xmath73 ) and f814w ( @xmath74 ) filters halo fields in a sample of eight nearby highly inclined galaxies , to construct the color - magnitude diagram for the halo diffuse stellar populations in spiral galaxies .",
    "the observations were designed in a way that the resultant color - magnitude diagrams are complete to at least a magnitude below the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "such depth secures the usage of the red giant branch stars to investigate the properties of stellar halos . with this galaxy sample and data quality , it is possible to begin addressing systematically questions regarding the correlations between the properties of spiral halo field stellar populations and spiral galaxy properties .",
    "we have found that the halo color - magnitude diagrams are morphologically dominated by old red giant branch stars , with no significant number of halo stars brighter than the classic old tip of the red giant branch .",
    "this is consistent with the conventional interpretation of galaxy halos being composed primarily by an homogeneous , old stellar population .",
    "however , the color range spanned by giant stars is sensitive to the parent galaxy luminosity .",
    "the stellar halos of bright galaxies contain red giant branch stars with redder colors than faint galaxies .",
    "a finely spaced grid of theoretical evolutionary tracks together with an empirical red giant branch of a galactic metal - rich cluster of a known metallicity , was used to convert the color - magnitude diagrams of the halo stellar populations into photometric metallicity distributions .",
    "the distributions of stellar metallicities are found to show a broad peak at the metal - rich end , with low metallicity tails extending to @xmath38\\sim\\,-2}$ ] , with a fairly sharp edge at the high - metallicity end .",
    "the metallicity of the metal - rich peaks depend on the parent galaxy luminosity .",
    "the halo stellar populations are dominated by moderately high - metallicites , i.e. , @xmath75<0}$ ] .",
    "this suggests that stellar halos are more likely to be formed by the disruption of intermediate mass galaxies , i.e. , similar to m  32 and lmc , rather than the accretion of metal - poor dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "the simple chemical model does match the metallicity distribution to first order , with the effective yields best matching the observed distributions increasing with the galaxy luminosity .",
    "the analysis of the departures of observed metallicity distributions from the predictions of the simple chemical models indicates that the halo may have built up gradually from a pre - enriched gas",
    ".    a high priority for future work should be the extension of this type of analysis to other spiral galaxies , targeting a variety of morphological types , disc and bulge properties , and position on the hubble sequence .",
    "this will more fully reveal the variation and trends in halo properties , and to what extent the halo of the milky way is unique .",

    "<S> we report results of a campaign to image the stellar populations in the halos of highly inclined spiral galaxies , with the fields roughly 10 kpc ( projected ) from the nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we use the f814w ( i ) and f606w ( v ) filters in the wide field planetary camera 2 , on board the hubble space telescope .    </S>",
    "<S> we unambiguously resolve the stellar halos one to two magnitudes fainter than the tip of the red giant branch . </S>",
    "<S> extended halo populations are detected in all galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the color - magnitude diagrams appear to be completely dominated by giant - branch stars , with no evidence for the presence of young stellar populations in any of the fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity distribution function for the galaxy sample is derived from interpolation within an extensive grid of red giant branch loci . </S>",
    "<S> these loci are derived from theoretical sequences which are calibrated using the galactic globular clusters , and also using empirical sequences for metal - rich stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the metallicity distribution functions are dominated by metal - rich populations , with a tail extending toward the metal poor end . to first order , </S>",
    "<S> the overall shapes of the metallicity distribution functions are similar to what is predicted by simple , single - component model of chemical evolution with the effective yields increasing with galaxy luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> however , metallicity distributions significantly narrower than the simple model are observed for a few of the most luminous galaxies in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancies are similar to those previously observed for ngc  5128 , the halo of m  31 , and the galactic bulge .    </S>",
    "<S> our observations may be used to help distinguish between models for the formation of spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it appears clear that more luminous spiral galaxies also have more metal - rich stellar halos . </S>",
    "<S> the increasingly significant departures from the closed - box model for the more luminous galaxies indicate that a parameter in addition to a single yield is required to describe chemical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter , which could be related to gas infall or outflow either in situ or in progenitor dwarf galaxies that later merge to form the stellar halo , tends to act to make the metallicity distributions narrower at high metallicity . </S>"
