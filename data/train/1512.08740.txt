    "frictionless hard - sphere packings in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath5 has a venerable history because this idealized model captures the salient structural features of many complex systems such as liquids @xcite , crystals @xcite , glasses @xcite , colloids @xcite , granular media @xcite , heterogeneous materials @xcite , and powders @xcite .",
    "a packing in @xmath6-dimensional euclidean space @xmath7 is defined as a large collection of nonoverlapping solid objects ( particles ) .",
    "the packing fraction @xmath8 is the fraction of space @xmath7 covered by the particles . during the last decade ,",
    "the well - known kepler conjecture that the densest way to pack equal - sized spheres in @xmath5 is the face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) lattice ( or its stacking variants ) was finally proven @xcite .",
    "equal - sized hard - sphere systems in thermodynamic _ equilibrium _ exhibit a first - order liquid - solid phase transition @xcite at the freezing point . upon a very rapid compression of a hard - sphere liquid beyond the freezing point , the system falls out of equilibrium and follows a _ metastable _ branch , whose end state is presumably the maximally random jammed ( mrj ) state in the infinite - volume limit @xcite",
    ".    roughly speaking , mrj packings @xcite are mechanically stable packings with maximal disorder .",
    "specifically , they contain a subset of strictly - jammed ( i.e. , mechanically stable ) particles ( backbone ) that allow no simultaneous collective motion of the particles and non - volume - increasing strains of the system boundary , with the unjammed remainder ( rattlers ) imprisoned by the backbone and possess minimal order , as measured by a variety of order metrics @xcite .",
    "mrj packings can be considered to be prototypical glasses @xcite because they are maximally disordered nonequilibrium structures and perfectly rigid with unbounded elastic moduli @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional mrj packings of equal - sized spheres have a packing fraction @xmath9 @xcite , and an isostatic backbone @xcite , implying that the backbone possesses the minimum number of particle contacts required for strict jamming .",
    "it is important to note that the mrj state is a mathematically well - defined state that is distinguishable from the more ambiguous random close packing state @xcite , especially in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "sphere packings with a polydispersity in size have a richer phase diagram than their monodisperse counterparts and enable a greater control of their structural characteristics , such as density and degree of order .",
    "polydisperse sphere packings have served as structural models for a variety of solid states matter including high temperature and pressure phases of various binary intermetallic and rare - gas compounds @xcite , alloys @xcite , solid propellants @xcite , concrete @xcite , and ceramics @xcite .",
    "it has been recently suggested that the packing fraction at which the viscosity of hard - sphere suspensions diverges is closely related to the mrj density @xcite .",
    "also , confined mrj binary packings are relevant in the evolution of particle segregation in dense granular flow @xcite . using the torquato - jiao ( tj ) packing algorithm @xcite , hopkins _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that mrj packings of binary spheres can achieve anomalously large packing fractions with a range of rattler concentrations .",
    "this structural tunability capability has implications for the design of novel granular low - porosity powders @xcite .",
    "_ finite _ disordered jammed packings have received considerably less attention than their _ bulk _ counterparts , whether confined or not .",
    "recent studies have investigated finite densest local sphere packings without boundaries in both two and three dimensions @xcite . moreover , other studies have shown that boundaries modify local and large - scale packing arrangements , affecting the associated macroscopic properties of the materials as well @xcite . our focus in this work is confined disordered packings since they provide many open fundamental questions ( as detailed subsequently below ) and arise in practice . in planar fuel cell electrode materials ,",
    "the particle packings are confined in one direction and in the vicinity of mrj states @xcite .",
    "spatial constraints also arise in many packing problems in biology , including packings of organelles within cells @xcite , packings of living cells that comprise a variety of tissues @xcite , natural photonic structures consisting of dense disordered arrangements of chitin nanoparticles @xcite , and the spatial distribution of cancer cells among healthy cells @xcite .",
    "_ quasi _ two - dimensional hard - sphere packings @xcite are packings that are confined in one direction with a length scale on the order of a few to tens of particle sizes . much of the previous work on confinement focused on the study of equal - sized hard spheres in equilibrium trapped between two parallel hard planes with plane separation distances up to five sphere diameters @xcite .",
    "these equilibrium studies have shed light on many fundamental questions such as freezing , glass formation , and the transition of systems between two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "various exotic phases not observed in their bulk counterparts were shown to arise , including buckled monolayer , rhombic bilayer , adaptive prism phases , etc .",
    "desmond and weeks @xcite have investigated confined `` random close '' packings of a 50 - 50 binary mixture of spheres with a small to large sphere radius ratio of 5/7 in both two and three dimensions .",
    "their findings qualitatively demonstrate that the presence of confining walls significantly alters packing characteristics , including substantially lowering packing fractions and inducing layered structures in the vicinity of the hard walls .",
    "however , as the authors pointed out themselves , it is not clear if their algorithm produced mathematically well - defined mrj states that are mechanically stable ; more specifically , the packings generated by their algorithm could be at most collectively jammed , i.e. , no collective motion of any subset of particles exists that can lead to unjamming of the packing in a non - deforming container @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the generation and analysis of high - fidelity _ isostatic _ mrj binary hard - sphere packings that are confined between two parallel hard planes separated by a distance @xmath0 . ,",

    "we consider _ binary _ packings since almost all real systems possess some degree of particle size disparity .",
    "the packing characteristics depend on @xmath0 , small to large sphere radius ratio @xmath1 , and small sphere relative concentration @xmath2 @xcite . in the bulk case ,",
    "the tj sequential linear programming algorithm @xcite has been shown to produce high - fidelity mrj packings that are strictly jammed and isostatic @xcite .",
    "here we generalize the tj algorithm @xcite to obtain for the first time putative mrj packings that are exactly isostatic over a large range of plane separation distances @xmath0 , sphere size ratios , and compositions .",
    "note that isostatic packings confined between two parallel hard planes possess @xmath10 particle - particle and particle - plane contact pairs , which we will discuss in more details in sec .",
    "some open fundamental questions that we wish to address in the present study are the following : ( 1 ) how do confined mrj binary sphere packings differ structurally from their bulk counterparts ?",
    "for example , are they isostatic as in the bulk case @xcite or are they hyperstatic ?",
    "are rattlers more prevalent when mrj packings are confined relative to their bulk counterparts ?",
    "\\(2 ) what are good order metrics and structural descriptors to identify and characterize true mrj states for confined binary sphere packings ?",
    "\\(3 ) how do packing fractions , rattler fractions and order metrics vary as functions of @xmath0 for binary sphere packings at different @xmath1 and @xmath2 ?",
    "\\(4 ) how do confined mrj packings transition between two and three dimensions ?",
    "our findings shed light on aspects of these open questions . specifically , we find that the rattler fractions of confined packings are generally higher than those of their bulk counterparts .",
    "we introduce an order metric @xmath3 ( defined in sec .",
    "iii ) , which is based on the number density fluctuations in the direction perpendicular to the hard walls , to quantify the order of packings .",
    "we observe that packing fraction , rattler fraction and disorder of mrj packings generally increase with @xmath0 , though exceptions exist .",
    "we also observe that when @xmath0 is on the order of two large - sphere diameters or less , the packings exhibit salient two - dimensional ( 2d ) features ; when @xmath0 exceeds about 30 large - sphere diameters , the packings approach three - dimensional ( 3d ) bulk packings .",
    "we find that at intermediate @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the disorder of packings is maximized for a given @xmath0 , as measured by the aforementioned order metric @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the confined systems tend to have more backbone spheres with fewer contacts relative to their bulk counterparts , which decrease with @xmath0 and exhibit smaller density fluctuations compared to corresponding poisson point processes .",
    "we also determine to what extent the confined packings retain the large - scale hyperuniformity property of their bulk counterparts .",
    "a hyperuniform many - particle system is one that is characterized by an anomalously large suppression of long - wavelength density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "our findings in general are relevant to confined packings that arise in biology ( e.g. , structural color in birds @xcite and insects @xcite ) and may have implications for the creation of high - density powders @xcite and improved battery designs @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the generalized tj algorithm employed to generate confined packings and the relation to determine isostaticity for these packings . in sec .",
    "iii , we employ various statistics and structural descriptors to characterize confined mrj binary hard - sphere packings . in sec .",
    "iv , we offer concluding remarks , and propose directions in which our work might be related and extended .",
    "in this section we first discuss the generalized tj sequential linear programming algorithm @xcite that we will employ to generate confined packings . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "the task of generating dense packings of hard particles was formulated as an optimization problem called the adaptive shrinking cell ( asc ) scheme .",
    "the objective function is taken to be the negative of the packing fraction @xmath8 .",
    "the positions and orientations of the particles of fixed sizes as well as the deformation and compression / expansion of the periodic simulation box are the optimization design variables",
    ". the asc optimization problem can be solved using various techniques , depending on the shapes of the particles @xcite . in the case of sphere packings in the vicinity of a jamming basin @xcite",
    ", the objective function and impenetrability constraints can be exactly linearized .",
    "this enables one to exploit the efficient tj sequential linear programming algorithm that enables one , in principle , to generate strictly jammed bulk sphere packings that are ordered as well as disordered , including such isostatic mrj packings @xcite .",
    "here we generalize the tj algorithm to take into account confinement and apply to produce mrj packings of binary spheres at different @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "it is noteworthy that although in this work the generalized tj algorithm is employed to generate disordered jammed packings , it can be readily applied to produce confined hyperstatic ordered packings by tuning key parameters , such as the use of small number of particles and increasing the influence sphere radius @xcite .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied to a fundamental cell containing @xmath11 spheres in directions parallel to the fixed hard walls , allowing the simulation box to deform and shrink on average in these directions , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "@xmath12{fig1.eps } \\end{array}$ ]    the number of independent components for the strain tensor @xmath13 applied to the fundamental cell is reduced due to the confinement and @xmath13 possesses the following form : @xmath14 also , in the direction perpendicular to the planes , additional constraints are applied such that the spheres do not move beyond the impenetrable planes .",
    "specifically , the following objective function is employed for the linear program : @xmath15 where @xmath13 is a strain tensor that deforms and shrinks on average the fundamental cell in directions parallel to the confining planes .",
    "the adaptive fundamental cell is described by a generating matrix @xmath16 : @xmath17 the quadratic nonoverlap constraints between spheres are linearized locally to give : @xmath18 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the diameter , local coordinate ( in the lattice coordinate system ) and local displacement of sphere @xmath22 , @xmath23+@xmath24+@xmath25 is the relative displacement from sphere @xmath22 to sphere @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the gram matrix of the lattice @xmath16 .",
    "the constraints that spheres can not move beyond the fixed hard walls can be expressed as : @xmath28      we establish the relation to determine isostaticity for packing of hard spheres confined between two parallel hard planes separated by a distance @xmath0 . for confined packings of frictionless spheres in @xmath5 ,",
    "there are @xmath29 degrees of freedom associated with translating the spheres ( up to uniform translations of the whole packing under periodic boundary conditions in parallel directions ) , where @xmath30 is the number of ( jammed ) backbone spheres .",
    "the simulation box is allowed to deform for strict jamming in parallel directions and thus there are three additional degrees of freedom associated with straining the fundamental cell , totaling @xmath31 degrees of freedom that must be constrained .",
    "since the nonoverlap constraints are inequality constraints , @xmath32 of them are required to satisfy isostaticity .",
    "since the system volume can not increase , the first constraint is @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the number of other constraints provided by particle - particle and particle - plane contact pairs should be equal to the number of degrees of freedom , i.e. , the number of particle - particle and particle - plane contact pairs @xmath34 should be @xmath35 note that this number is different from the bulk case , where isostatic strictly - jammed sphere packings should possess @xmath36 particle - particle contact pairs @xcite .",
    "we first provide some general remarks about jammed particle states in the confined space between two parallel planes separated by @xmath0 . not surprisingly , confined jammed packings are generally structurally distinctly different from their bulk counterparts , especially when @xmath0 is not much larger than the characteristic particle size @xmath37 , which is defined as the average sphere diameter .",
    "this is because certain local particle configurations found in bulk packings are inconsistent with local configurations near hard walls due to the impenetrability conditions imposed by walls .",
    "we will henceforth refer to this phenomenon as `` confinement frustration '' .",
    "moreover , confined packings present additional subtleties because the nature of the jammed states depend on @xmath0 in a nontrivial way .",
    "for example , a jammed state for a fixed value of @xmath0 does not necessarily remain jammed upon an infinitesimal change in @xmath0 via infinitesimal local particle rearrangements ; the packing can undergo discontinuous transitions between jammed states as @xmath0 varies across these critical values of @xmath0 , which involve dramatic , finite global rearrangements of the particles , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "these transitions lead to discontinuities in packing characteristics of the jammed states , as we will see later .",

    "the number of spheres @xmath11 in the fundamental cell is chosen such that the length scale of the generated mrj packing in directions parallel with the hard walls is at least of the order of 10 large sphere diameters .",
    "this criterion is used to suppress finite - size effects in the directions where periodic boundary conditions are applied @xcite . specifically , at small @xmath0 , @xmath11 is chosen to be 1000 ; while at large @xmath0 , @xmath11 is chosen to be 4000 .",
    "the great majority of packings that we produce using the generalized tj algorithm are exactly isostatic according to formula ( [ eq_6 ] ) , although a small percentage at certain values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 include one or two more particle - particle and particle - plane contacts than the number corresponding to isostaticity , presumably because the numerical tolerance of the simulations were not sufficient to distinguish between proximity and contact .",
    "figure [ fig_3 ] shows two representative packings obtained in our simulations : a 1000-sphere packing at @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 close to the equal - sized sphere case and a 4000-sphere packing at @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 with a large size contrast .",
    "it can be clearly seen that both configurations are disordered and densely packed , distinct from those confined crystalline phases reported previously @xcite . moreover , in both cases the hard walls induce contacting layered structures that locally pack inefficiently .",

    "[ fig_4 ] we plot @xmath50 and @xmath51 as functions of @xmath0 at @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "we find that generally @xmath50 increases with @xmath0 in terms of the overall trend and approaches the bulk value when @xmath0 is of the order of 30 large - sphere diameters , as finite - size and boundary effects become negligible .",
    "note that the bulk value of @xmath50 is 0.639 @xcite for the monodisperse case and 0.785 @xcite for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we find that rattlers in confined packings are generally more prevalent than in their bulk counterparts @xcite , which is induced by hard boundaries . as @xmath0 increases ,",
    "the rattler fraction gradually decreases to the bulk value , e.g. , roughly @xmath55 in the monodisperse mrj case @xcite and @xmath56 in the binary case of @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that at certain combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , there are local maxima and minima in @xmath50 and @xmath51 as @xmath0 varies , for example , the local maxima for @xmath50 and minima for @xmath51 at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this is due to the aforementioned discontinuous transitions .",
    "note also that the fluctuations of @xmath50 are less significant at @xmath54 compared to @xmath61 .",
    "this is because when the size contrast is large , @xmath62 is much larger than @xmath63 ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the diameters of the small and large spheres , respectively ) , and the hard walls affect the large spheres substantially more than the small spheres . as a result ,",
    "as the number of small spheres increases , i.e. , @xmath2 increases , the effects of the hard walls on the packing structures become less significant , and @xmath50 depends relatively less sensitively on @xmath0 .    in addition , as the size contrast increases , the rattler fraction dramatically increases .",
    "this is due to `` size - disparity '' frustration ; i.e. , in this binary system , it is not possible for a subset of spheres with the same size , surrounded by spheres with another size , to be arranged into an inherent structure ( mechanically stable configurations at the local maxima in the density landscape ) of the corresponding single - component system .",

    "in this paper , we generalized the tj sequential linear algorithm to generate exactly isostatic putative mrj binary hard - sphere packings confined between two parallel hard planes over a large range of plane separation distances @xmath0 , small to large sphere radius ratio @xmath1 and small sphere relative concentration @xmath2 .",
    "we observe that these confined packings generally possess structural characteristics that are distinctly different from their bulk counterparts , including lower packing fractions , and higher rattler fractions , as well as varying degrees of disorder and particle contacts .",
    "this is due to what we call confinement frustration .",
    "we find that an order metric @xmath3 , which is based on the number density fluctuations in the direction perpendicular to the hard walls , is a useful measure of the degree of order ( disorder ) . by employing the local volume - fraction variance @xmath4",
    ", we find that these packings possess essentially the same level of hyperuniformity as their bulk counterparts .",
    "we also observe that the packing characteristics depend sensitively on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath0 smaller than 30 large sphere diameters due to the effects of confinement frustration , size - disparity frustration and discontinuous transitions .",
    "we have also observed that the packings gradually transition from ones with 2d - like layered structures to 3d bulk systems as @xmath0 increases from two to 30 large sphere diameters .",
    "the dependence of packing density on the confinement size has important practical implications in various powder technologies , where density is crucial to material properties and fabrication cost @xcite . by looking at how the packing fraction changes with plane separation distance @xmath0 in our simulation",
    ", we acquire knowledge about how the thickness of depositing layers affect the density and associated mechanical and transport properties of the resulting structures given the starting materials in powder technologies . in particular",
    ", we find that small - sized particles are favored to suppress the packing inefficiency caused by boundary and finite - size effects and they should be used to guarantee high density and superior material performances . when producing structures that have a dimension comparable to particle sizes , extremely large percentage of small particles should be mixed with a tiny percentage of large particles to suppress the density variance of individual samples caused by small errors in the thickness of depositing layers .",
    "also , our findings could be potentially useful in battery applications , e.g. solid oxide fuel cell electrode materials .",
    "when the length scale of the shortest dimension is less than about 30 particle diameters , boundary , and finite - size effects should be taken into account when we evaluate and tailor the macroscopic properties and performance of the electrode materials . in future work",
    ", we will investigate the optimal thickness , particle size ratio and composition that optimize the electrochemical properties of electrode materials such as maximizing reaction rate and ionic and electronic conductivities .",
    "in addition , we might be able to design novel photonic structures and devices by tailoring the size distribution of nanoparticles in finite particle packings @xcite according to information acquired in our simulations .    besides the packings of binary hard spheres confined between two parallel hard planes we have studied in this work , there are many other interesting packing problems in confined space that remain to be investigated @xcite .",
    "for example , while _ bulk _ mrj packings of nonspherical particles that span a wide range of shapes , including ellipsoids @xcite , superballs @xcite , and polyhedra @xcite have been studied in detail , nothing is known about confined mrj packings of nonspherical particles .",
    "understanding how confined mrj packings of nonspherical particles differ from their bulk counterparts and confined mrj sphere packings are outstanding questions .",
    "extensions of this work to dna packaging is an interesting avenue for future research @xcite .",
