    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) are the non - perturbative objects encoding the information about the quark and gluon proton structure in the most complete way . while the chiral even gpds are probed in various hard exclusive processes , the access to transverse spin dependent chiral - odd gpds has only recently been shown to be possible @xcite . since in the massless quark limit",
    ", chiral - odd functions must appear in pairs in a non - vanishing scattering amplitude , so that chirality flip encoded in one of them is compensated by another , a crucial point of our proposal is to use the transverse @xmath1 meson chiral - odd distribution amplitude .",
    "we propose to use the transverse momentum of the first meson as the large scale needed to garanty the factorization of the gpd from a hard subprocess .",
    "the nature of the first meson depends on the energy range of the experiment . at large energy",
    "( e.g. in the compass kinematics ) , diffractive production of a vector meson is much favored as compared to pseudoscalar meson production , and we thus focus on the process @xmath2 while at lower energies ( e.g. in the jlab kinematics ) , the process @xmath3 may be easier to detect . in both cases , one should also consider the reference process , _ without _ the transversity gpd @xmath4     in the qcd factorization approach . ]    in this presentation , we restrict to the large energy case where the off - shell exchanged object may be seen as a pomeron ( fig . 1 ) and a complete computation is available @xcite .",

    "the amplitude is the convolution of a hard ( perturbative ) part @xmath13 , two ( non - perturbative ) meson das @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the ( non - perturbative ) gpds of the target @xmath16 , written as an integral over the longitudinal momentum fractions of the quarks @xmath17 the hard part @xmath13 is described by 6 diagrams ( fig .",
    "the hard scale is the `` pomeron '' virtuality @xmath18        .1 in the longitudinal @xmath19 or @xmath20 distribution amplitudes ( das ) are defined from @xmath21 with @xmath22 @xmath23 while the transverse @xmath24 da is @xmath25 with@xmath26    the transversity gpd is a non diagonal matrix element of the nonlocal operator @xmath27 @xmath28    not much is known about such a non perturbative object , and different plausible models will yield quite different counting rates .",
    "we have used two models : we generalized the meson pole model by gamberg et al @xcite to the kinematics with gpds and a model by scopetta @xcite based on the bag model .",
