    "josephson junctions have been shown to be effective qubit elements for solid - state quantum computing architectures.@xcite several proposals for multi - qubit coupling introduce electromagnetic@xcite or mechanical@xcite resonators , or other oscillators,@xcite to mediate interactions between the qubits .",
    "such resonator - based coupling schemes have additional functionality resulting from the ability to tune the qubits relative to the resonator frequency , as well as to each other .",
    "these qubit - resonator systems are analogous to one or more tunable few - level atoms in an electromagnetic cavity , and the dynamics is often accurately described by the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) or jaynes - cummings model of quantum optics.@xcite    for a qubit with energy level spacing @xmath0 coupled with strength @xmath1 to a resonator with angular frequency @xmath2 and quality factor @xmath3 , the rwa is valid when both @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ". however , the resonant rabi frequency , which is proportional to @xmath1 , is then much smaller than the qubit frequency @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , restricting @xmath1 to be in the simpler weak coupling regime leads to quantum information processing that is slower than necessary , allowing fewer operations to be performed during the available quantum coherence lifetime .",
    "the threshold theorem @xcite states that if the component failure probability @xmath7 is below some threshold @xmath8 , a computation with an error probability bounded by @xmath9 may be accomplished , provided a sufficient number of quantum gates are used for fault - tolerant encoding . in practice , it will be important to have @xmath7 as small as possible . to approach this limit , we wish to study qubit - resonator systems with stronger coupling ( larger @xmath1 ) than may be correctly described by the rwa .",
    "this will allow us to consider faster switching times for qubit - resonator gates , and to understand to what extent the coupling may be increased while still retaining good fidelity .    in this paper",
    ", we use a basis of dressed states@xcite to calculate the leading - order corrections to the rwa for a josephson junction phase qubit coupled to a solid - state nanoelectromechanical resonator , or for any other model of a two - level system linearly coupled to a single - mode boson field . by comparison with exact numerical results ,",
    "we demonstrate that the method is accurate for moderately strong coupling and provides a useful theoretical tool for describing fast quantum information processing .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes the low - energy dynamics of a single large - area , current - biased josephson junction , coupled to a piezoelectric nanoelectromechanical disk resonator , can be written as@xcite @xmath10 where the @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote particle creation and annihilation operators for the josephson junction states @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote ladder operators for the phonon states of the resonator s dilatational ( thickness oscillation ) mode of frequency @xmath2 , @xmath1 is a coupling constant with dimensions of energy , and @xmath15 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 depends on material properties and size of the resonator , and can be designed to achieve a wide range of values.@xcite an illustration showing two phase qubits coupled to the same resonator is given in fig .",
