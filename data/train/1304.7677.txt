    "high - energy quarks and gluons passing through hot and cold nuclear matter have their transverse momentum distributions broadened due to multiple , inelastic , scattering with the constituents of the nuclear matter @xcite . this transverse momentum broadening can be nicely expressed in terms of the elastic scattering of a quark or gluon dipole in the nuclear matter as given in below .",
    "in fact the relationship between , say , quark transverse momentum broadening and the elastic scattering of a quark - antiquark dipole given in appears to be a rather general relationship in gauge theories @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will exploit this relationship to evaluate @xmath0-broadening where the broadening may come from gluon radiation as well as from multiple scattering .",
    "more precisely , @xmath0-broadening from inelastic multiple scatterings is given as @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the length of the material and @xmath7 is the transport coefficient corresponding to the hard parton , quark or gluon , passing through the medium , hot or cold qcd matter .",
    "in this paper we evaluate next to leading order corrections which are enhanced by single and double logarithms , that is radiative corrections of size @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath2 is the `` size '' of the scatterers in the medium .",
    "the full expression of the radiative correction to the @xmath0-broadening is shown in .",
    "although @xmath2 serves as an infrared cut - off in the calculation , we shall see explicitly that the double and single logarithmic terms are independent of the exact definition of @xmath2 .    to a large extent",
    "this paper is motivated by an earlier paper by one of us ( bw ) who dealt with the same problem in ref .  @xcite . that paper formulated the next to leading order @xmath0-broadening problem in terms of the bdmps formalism @xcite developed for calculating radiative energy loss of high - energy partons passing through nuclear matter . however , the bdmps formalism has a shortcoming , namely the single scattering term with the medium is absent . for radiative energy loss",
    "this is not a difficulty , at least for a sufficiently large medium , since the dominant contribution comes from multiple scattering .",
    "but in the present context the single scattering term is crucial .",
    "there is a second formalism , developed by b.  g.  zakharov @xcite for calculating radiative energy loss . while the formalism of zakharov , in contrast to bdmps , does not _",
    "explicitly _ eliminate the single scattering term the final answers for radiative energy loss are identical in the two formalisms in the harmonic oscillator approximation .",
    "however , for radiative @xmath0-broadening this is not the case and as a result the zakharov formalism seems better suited to the broadening problem .",
    "we could get our result by taking the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite and adding the single scattering term missing in ref .",
    "we have done this but we believe our present discussion to be simpler .    the zakharov formalism is a dipole - like formalism with the difference being that the quark - antiquark - gluon system , dominant in radiative energy loss or radiative @xmath0-broadening , is not frozen in impact parameter over the times of the scatterings as in the case in normal high - energy scattering uses of the dipole formalism @xcite . however , in the single scattering approximation in our current application a zakharov type formalism is the same as the normal dipole formalism . as we shall see below all the double logarithmic terms and some of the single logarithmic terms come from single scattering and must be given by a simple dipole evaluation .",
    "it is not hard to see why the single scattering plays such a prominent role in the present calculation . in the dipole picture nonradiative @xmath0-broadening",
    "is given as the fourier transform of the elastic scattering of a dipole of transverse size @xmath10 with the medium as given in .",
    "the dipole size which dominates the integral in is @xmath11 where @xmath12 so that in terms of the dipole formalism only a few elastic scatterings , over the length @xmath1 of the medium , are used to determine the typical transverse momentum given by the _",
    "inelastic scatterings of the quark passing through the medium .",
    "if we now add a radiative gluon to the dipole the gluon can be characterized by its lifetime and the transverse size ( @xmath13 ) that it makes with the original quark - antiquark dipole of size @xmath10 . in order to get a double logarithmic contribution",
    "it is necessary to have logarithmic integrals over both the lifetime of the gluon fluctuation and @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath13 must be much larger than @xmath10 , because the quark - antiquark dipole only has , typically , a single scattering over a time @xmath1 and now we wish to have the quark - antiquark - gluon system to interact with the medium over a time , or distance , short compared to @xmath1 .",
    "however it is known that when @xmath14 the probability of a quark - antiquark dipole to emit a gluon goes as @xmath15 .",
    "this is not a logarithmic integral , however , it becomes logarithmic if and only if one includes a single scattering , which gives an additional factor of @xmath16 .",
    "however , if we include more than one scattering , the logarithmic structure is destroyed . as we will see in the following calculation",
    "there is no double logarithmic contribution from the multiple scattering region .",
    "we are now in a position to indicate which kinematic regions give single and double logarithmic contributions in terms of the regions shown in where , for technical convenience , we have chosen to characterize the radiative gluon by its lifetime , @xmath17 , and its energy , @xmath18 .",
    "the reasons that we divide the phase space into different regions , separated by the boundaries @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , will be explained in detail in .",
    "as indicated in the figure the lifetime can be between zero and @xmath1 while the energy of the gluon is between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the interior of the region between lines @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 gives the double logarithmic contribution to the radiative contribution to @xmath3 of the quark .",
    "single logarithmic contribution comes from regions close to the lines @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the line @xmath20 is the transition between single scattering dominance , below @xmath20 , and multiple elastic scattering where the @xmath24 in becomes small , above @xmath20 .",
    "the region close to line @xmath19 is a single scattering region where the transverse distance between the gluon and either the quark or antiquark is comparable to the quark - antiquark separation @xmath10 .",
    "the region around line @xmath21 is the region where the lifetime of the gluon is on the order of the proton s size , for cold matter . in this region",
    "the transport coefficient can no longer be treated as a constant since the gluon distribution included in @xmath7 is evaluated at large @xmath25-values .",
    "this region is , however , dominated by single scattering with the medium .",
    "we should comment on some of the limitations and subtleties of our calculation . *",
    "( a ) * we have done our calculation in a context of taking the transport coefficient @xmath7 to be scale independent .",
    "this is not necessarily the best choice , so in we do a running coupling calculation of the double logarithmic radiative terms .",
    "curiously the double logarithmic contribution to @xmath3 turns out to be exactly a factor of two greater in the running coupling case as compared to fixed coupling and , remarkably , no @xmath26 terms appear .",
    "we do not understand how to do single logarithmic terms in the present running coupling context . *",
    "( b ) * in all the regions in which there are important contributions it is only near the boundary ( a ) in that the emitted gluon transverse coordinate gets as close to either the quark or antiquark as the size of the quark - antiquark separation .",
    "thus except for the boundary @xmath19 calculation given in we can define a mean @xmath27 , @xmath3 , using .",
    "however near the boundary @xmath19 there is an @xmath28 dependence for @xmath29 so that the mean of @xmath27 no longer makes sense .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath30 behavior for large @xmath27 in @xmath31 .",
    "an almost identical issue has been discussed earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite where it was suggested to replace the idea of a mean @xmath27 by that of a typical @xmath27 .",
    "this amounts to taking the @xmath32 in on all terms other than the @xmath33 and at the end setting @xmath34 to its normal scale , in our case @xmath35 . in the calculation given in",
    "we follow this prescription and leave the answer , in and , in terms of @xmath34 . in our final estimate",
    "we take @xmath36 to get . *",
    "( c ) * the double logarithmic terms can be resummed , and this is done in .",
    "however , it seems that one needs media lengths rather large for this resummation to be useful . for lengths of about @xmath37",
    "the first leading double logarithmic term gives the dominant contribution .",
    "* ( d ) * the radiative corrections are reasonably important , comparable to the values of @xmath27 coming from nonradiative multiple scattering .",
    "this is similar to the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows : in we briefly describe @xmath0-broadening of a quark due to multiple inelastic scatterings and remind the reader that these inelastic scatterings can be recast in terms of the elastic scattering of a dipole in the medium . in we give , but do not derive , the general formalism which we use , a generalization of the formalism that zakharov developed for radiative energy loss . in we",

    "if the quark enters the nucleus with no transverse momentum and exits having transverse momentum @xmath0 , then the distribution of transverse momenta is given by @xmath38 where @xmath29 is the @xmath24-matrix for elastic scattering of a quark - antiquark dipole of transverse size @xmath10 on the nucleus . in the mv model",

    "the problem of @xmath0-broadening of a quark which is produced in a nucleus , say in a proton - nucleus or a nucleus - nucleus collisions , is quite different from that of a quark entering the nucleus from outside . for a high - energy quark entering the nucleus from outside , small-@xmath25",
    "evolution corresponds to an evolved wave function of the corresponding dipole as it enters the nucleus .",
    "that is , small-@xmath25 evolution mainly occurs before the quark , or corresponding dipole , reaches the target .",
    "however , a quark produced in the nucleus through a hard collision is produced as a bare quantum and small-@xmath25 evolution is much more limited , and that evolution occurs in the nuclear environment .",
    "it is precisely these ( small-@xmath25 ) radiative corrections to @xmath0-broadening of a ( bare ) quark produced in a hard collision which is the topic of this paper . at the mv level",
    "there is no distinction between a quark entering a nucleus from outside and a quark created in the nucleus so that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dn ] ) , ( [ eq : snucleus ] ) , ( [ eq : snucleon ] ) and ( [ eq : sat ] ) are valid while should remain valid even in the presence of radiation in the nuclear medium , that is beyond the mv approximation .",
    "we have seen that quark @xmath0-broadening due to multiple scattering of the quark in a nuclear medium can be succinctly expressed in terms of the elastic scattering of a quark - antiquark dipole in the medium . the quark part of the dipole corresponding to the quark in the original amplitude and the antiquark in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "this same picture holds true when radiative corrections are included @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-broadening due to multiple scattering and single gluon emission is given by elastic scattering of a dipole in the medium where the dipole emits , and later absorbs , a gluon as it passes through the medium .",
    "we shall focus on soft gluon emission in which case the quark and antiquark making up the dipole can be viewed as fixed in transverse coordinate space during the emission and absorption of the gluon .",

    "we shall first evaluate in the region @xmath85 , a relatively easy task , to obtain the double logarithmic contribution .",
    "then we shall , in turn , integrate across the boundary lines @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 which , after doing the remaining logarithmic integration , will give the complete single logarithmic contributions . the constant , non - logarithmic contributions coming near the intersections of the lines @xmath90 $ ] , @xmath91 $ ] and @xmath92 $ ] are beyond what we are currently able to do .",

    "this is as previously discussed just below .",
    "similarly , the upper limit on the @xmath18-integration requires @xmath105 or , again using , @xmath106 is the requirement that @xmath104 be greater than the transverse size of the quark - antiquark dipole",

    "the equivalence of with and at the double logarithmic level confirms the constant factor we have taken in front of the right hand side of .",
    "in order to obtain a complete expression for @xmath3 , apart from the double logarithmic term , we also have to calculate the single logarithmic correction to @xmath3 , which requires to do the @xmath119 and @xmath120 integration in over the entire allowed phase space , i.e. @xmath70 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is natural to divide the energy domain into two different regions , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and do the calculation for each region separately .",
    "the reason we make this division is that the calculation near the boundaries @xmath19 and @xmath21 are very different .",
    "moreover , when we do the @xmath120 and @xmath119 integration over a certain region of the phase space , it is convenient to do the @xmath17-integral first but leave the @xmath18 variable unintegrated . the @xmath18-integration will be carried out after we combine contributions from different regions of phase space . the final expression for @xmath3 , ,",
    "contains a double logarithmic term , as found in , and a single logarithmic term , which comes from crossing different boundaries @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and an undetermined constant term .",

    "next , we deal with the boundaries @xmath19 and @xmath21 separately . the @xmath17-integration for those two boundaries will be done from @xmath22 to @xmath124 such that when we add the contributions from the three regions together there is no @xmath124 dependence .",
    "finally , we do the @xmath18-integration and obtain our final expression for @xmath3 .",
    "note that crossing the boundary @xmath20 is relatively simple and in our approximation [ eq : nw ] is the correct formula that we should use in the regions @xmath85 and @xmath89 .",
    "so in the following calculation we first calculate the contribution to @xmath3 from regions @xmath85 and @xmath89 , then extract the single logarithmic contributions from the boundaries @xmath19 and @xmath21 by modifying the dipole formula [ eq : ss ] .",
    "one reason we have to reformulate the dipole formula is that in a time integral is used , so when crossing the boundaries @xmath19 and @xmath21 we have to express the dipole formula in terms of a time integration .",
    "after all if we want to connect calculations from different regions of phase space , we have to connect them by the same variable .",
    "the complication arises from converting the transverse coordinates integration in the dipole formula to a time integration .",
    "another reason is that below those two boundaries certain kinematic limitation of the dipole formula will be met , the formulas no longer take the simple and compact form .",
    "we will discuss the limitations and modifications in more detail as we carry out the calculation .",
    "as we have seen in our previous calculation , in the limit @xmath125 gives the same double logarithmic contribution as the single scattering contribution from the simple dipole calculation , .",
    "the line @xmath87 in can be taken as the separation of the single scattering and the multiple scatterings .",
    "as we start from the region @xmath85 , crossing the boundary @xmath20 , we enter the region @xmath89 where the multiple scatterings play the major role . in the multiple scattering region the green function is exponentially suppressed in @xmath16 as @xmath17 approaches @xmath1 , so there is no double logarithmic contribution from this region .",
    "we can choose some initial point @xmath124 , which is in the double logarithmic region below the boundary @xmath20 but above the boundary @xmath19 or @xmath21 and satisfies @xmath126 .",
