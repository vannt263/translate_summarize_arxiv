    "large scale magnetic fields are widespread in the universe . from galaxies to clusters of galaxies",
    "coherent magnetic fields are detected , with intensities that range from @xmath3gauss to tenth of @xmath3gauss .",
    "our galaxy as well as nearby galaxies show magnetic fields coherent on the scale of the whole structure , while in galaxy clusters the coherent length is much less than the cluster s size @xcite . a remarkable fact recently discovered by observations , is that high redshift galaxies also posses coherent fields with the same intensitis as present day galaxies @xcite .",
    "this result challenges the generally accepted mechanism of magnetogenesis , namely the amplification of a primordial field of @xmath4 gauss by a mean field dynamo @xcite acting during a time of the order of the age of the structure : either the primordial fields are more intense so the galactic dynamo saturates in a shorter time , or the dynamo does not work as it is currently thought .",
    "it is hoped that future observations of high redshift environments will shed more light on the features of primordial magnetic fields @xcite .    in view of the lack of success in finding a primordial mechanism for magnetogenesis that produces a sufficiently intense field , either to feed an amplifying mechanism , or to directly explain the observations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite as recent reviews ) , researchers began to delve on magnetohydrodynamical effects that could compensate the tremendous dilution of the field due to flux conservation during the expansion of the universe . among the possibilities",
    "there is primordial turbulence @xcite .",
    "possible scenarios for it are the reheating epoch , the phase transitions ( at least the electroweak one ) and possibly the epoch of reionization , all dominated by out of equilibrium processes .",
    "a key ingredient to produce stable , large scale magnetic fields in three - dimensional mhd turbulence , is the transfer of magnetic helicity from small scales to large scales , at constant flux @xcite ( see also ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "magnetic helicity , @xmath5 , is defined as the volume integral of the scalar product of the magnetic field @xmath6 with the vector potential @xmath7 @xcite . in three dimensions , and in the absence of ohmic dissipation , it is a conserved quantity that accounts for the non - trivial topological properties of the magnetic field @xcite , such as the twists and links of the field lines . unlike the energy that performs a natural , direct cascade , i.e. , from large scales toward small ones where it is dissipated , magnetic helicity has the remarkable property of _ inverse cascading _ , that is , magnetic helicity stored in small scales evolves toward larger scales @xcite .",
    "the fact that magnetic energy and magnetic helicity spectra are dimensionally related as @xmath8 @xcite produces a dragging of the former toward large scales , thus enabling the field to re - organize coherently at large scales .",
    "it must be stressed that in a cosmological context , the inverse cascade mentioned above operates on scales of the order of the particle horizon or smaller .",
    "this is due to the fact that turbulence is a causal phenomenon .",
    "magnetic helicity on the other hand can be induced at any scale , the topology of the fields then remains frozen if the scales are super - horizon and if there is no resistive decay .",
    "for subhorizon scales it is a sufficient condition for its conservation that the conductivity of the plasma be infinite @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath5 as the number of twists and links must be considered with care because from its very definition it is clear that @xmath5 is gauge dependent . in their seminal work ,",
    "berger and field @xcite proved that if the field lines do not cross the boundaries of the volume of integration , i.e. , the field lines close inside the considered volume , then @xmath5 as defined _ is _ a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "these authors also addressed the case of open field lines , and wrote down a definition of gauge invariant magnetic helicity based on the difference of two such quantities for field configurations that have the same extension outside the considered volume . in this case the quantity obtained can be interpreted as the numbers of links inside the volume . in general",
    "it is not difficult to find early universe mechanisms that produce magnetic fields endowed with magnetic helicity : generation of helical magnetic fields has been already addressed in the framework of electroweak baryogenesis @xcite and of leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "the main problem is still in the low intensities obtained in more or less realistic scenarios .",
    "the magnetic fields we consider in this work are induced by stochastic currents of scalar charges created gravitationally during the transition inflation - reheating @xcite ( see @xcite for more details ) , and such field configuration is of open lines . in the light of the analysis of berger and field , we shall discuss a criterion by which the result obtained can be considered as gauge invariant .",
    "the fields induced are random , the mean value of the magnetic helicity is zero , but not the corresponding rms deviation .",
    "we assume that those fields are weak enough to neglect their backreaction on the source currents , and show that the rms magnetic helicity can be written as the sum of four sqed feynman graphs , one of them representing the mean value of @xmath0 and consequently identically null .",
    "the remaining three add to a non null value .",
    "we compute the value of the helicity for large scales and find that the number density of links scales with the distance @xmath9 from a given point as @xmath10 , which means that their fractal dimension is @xmath11 this number density takes into account defects due to both regular and random fields .",
    "we also calculate the value of @xmath0 due to regular fields on a large scale . in this case the number density scales as @xmath12 , the corresponding fractal dimension being @xmath2 . using the relation @xmath13 ,",
    "we compare the associated helical intensity to the one obtained by computing directly the correlation function of the magnetic field at the same scale @xmath14 .",
    "we find that both expressions coincide , which means that the fields generated by the considered mechanism are indeed helical .",
    "we estimate the intensity of those smooth fields on a galactic scale , finding an intensity too small to seed the dynamo .",
    "we finally address the evolution of fields generated at scales of the order of the particle horizon at the end of reheating , through the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity mechanism , until matter - radiation equilibrium .",
    "this evolution is based on the assumption that during radiation dominance the plasma is in a ( mild ) turbulent state .",
    "we find that the number density of magnetic links scales as @xmath15 , the corresponding fractal dimension then being @xmath16 .",
    "the field intensity as well as the scale of coherence are in a range that could have and impact on the process of structure formation @xcite .",
    "we work with signature @xmath17 and with natural units , i.e. , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "we use the hubble constant during inflation , @xmath20 , which we assume constant , to give dimensions to the different quantities , i.e. we consider spacetime coordinates @xmath21 = h^{-1}$ ] , lagrangian density @xmath22 = h^{4}$ ] , four vector potential @xmath23 = h$ ] , field tensor @xmath24 = h^{2}$ ] , scalar field @xmath25=h$ ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sed ] contains a brief description of scalar electrodynamics in curved spacetime . in section [ mh ]",
    "we define magnetic helicity and describe briefly its main properties . in section [ mhrf ]",
    "we develope the formalism to study magnetic helicity of random fields and estimate its rms value in different scenarios : in subsection [ demh ] we compute the sqed feynman graphs that describe the magnetic helicity two - point correlation function . in subsection [ dim ] we provide some physical quantities relevant for our study . in subsection [ hm - tir ]",
    "we describe the transition inflation - reheating and quote some useful formulae for our work . in subsection [ gd ]",
    "we apply the analysis of berger and field to our fields and show the gauge invariance of our results . in subsection [ mhls ]",
    "we calculte the magnetic helicity rms value on large scales , and compute the density and fractal dimension of the distribution of defects . in subsection [ hmgal ]",
    "we compute the rms value of magnetic helicity due to solely smooth fields , and find that the fields induced by the mechanism considered in this work are completely helical , but very weak .",
    "finally in subsection [ hm - ss ] we analyze the evolution of fields induced on scales of the order of the horizon at reheating along radiation dominance . by considering conservation of magnetic helicity and assuming full inverse cascade is operative",
    ", we find at decoupling a magnetic field of intensity and coherence that could impact on the process of structure formation .",
    "in section [ dc ] we sumarize and discuss our results .",
    "we leave details of the calculations to the appendices .",

    "the mean value of the electric current is zero , but not its rms deviation , which sources a random magnetic field , whose magnetic helicity we are going to compute .",
    "classically , magnetic helicity is defined as the volume integral of the scalar product between magnetic field and magnetic vector potencial @xcite , i.e. @xmath74 which in view of the dimensions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 it is already a dimensionlessl quantity . as stated in the introduction , it is a measure of the non - trivial topology of the magnetic field inside the volume @xmath77 , or in other words , eq .",

    "@xmath78 is one of the ideal invariants , i.e. it is a conserved quantity in the absense of ohmic dissipation @xcite .",
    "this means that magnetic helicity can not be created or destroyed by turbulence or non - dissipative evolution , being then a property of the magnetic field created at its birth . unlike other ideally conserved quantities in 3-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics ,",
    "magnetic helicity performs an _ inverse cascade _ @xcite .",
    "this means that instead of travelling towards small scales ( large wavenumber ) where it would be dissipated , it makes its way toward large scales ( small wavenumbers ) , carrying with it a bit of magnetic energy .",
    "mathematically , this is expressed by the spectral relation quoted above , i.e. , @xmath82 . in a framework of decaying turbulence ( that could exist at the earliest epochs of the universe ) , there would be a self - organization of the magnetic field at large scales , with the total energy contained in the considered volume decaying as @xmath83 and coherence length increasing as @xmath84 @xcite . for primordial magnetogenesis",
    "this fact can be of great help in obtaining stronger fields than the ones found up to now to seed subsequent amplifying mechanisms , or even to directly explain the observations .",
    "but on the other hand , the conservation of @xmath85 crucially constraints the operation of further amplifying mechanisms such as the mean field dynamo @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the possibility that primordial magnetic fields generated in the transition between inflation and reheating posses magnetic helicity , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the fields are induced by stochastic currents of scalar charged particles created during the mentioned transition . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the rms value of the induced magnetic helicity by computing different four - point sqed feynman diagrams . for any considered volume , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic flux across its boundaries is in principle non null , which means that the magnetic helicity in those regions is gauge dependent . </S>",
    "<S> we use the prescription given by berger and field and interpret our result as the difference between two magnetic configurations that coincide in the exterior volume . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic helicity gives only the number of magnetic links inside the considered volume . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a concrete value of @xmath0 for large scales and analyze the distribution of magnetic defects as a function of the scale . </S>",
    "<S> those defects correspond to regular as well as random fields in the considered volume . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fractal dimension of the distribution of topological defects is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also study if the regular fields induced on large scales are helical , finding that they are and that the associated number of magnetic defects is independent of the scale . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the fractal dimension is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we finally estimate the intensity of fields induced at the horizon scale of reheating , and evolve them until the decoupling of matter and radiation under the hypothesis of inverse cascade of magnetic helicity . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting intensity is high enough and the coherence length long enough to have an impact on the subsequent process of structure formation . </S>"
