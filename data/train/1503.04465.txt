    "sections of @xmath13 surfaces have been investigated at length ; yet , very little is known about curves lying on an abelian surface . if @xmath14 is a general polarized @xmath13 surface , the proof of nonemptiness and regularity of the severi variety parametrizing @xmath3-nodal curves in the linear system @xmath15 with @xmath16 is due to mumford for @xmath17 ( cf .",
    "* appendix ) ) , and chen @xcite in the general case .",
    "the main result concerning the brill - noether theory of linear sections of @xmath0 is due lazarsfeld @xcite , who proved that a general curve in the linear system @xmath4 is brill - noether general ; furthermore , no curve in @xmath4 possesses any linear series with negative brill - noether number .",
    "lazarsfeld s theorem provided an alternate proof of the gieseker - petri theorem , thus highlighting the vast potential of specialization to @xmath13 sections .",
    "indeed , this technique proved useful in many contexts , such as voisin s proof of green s conjecture for a general curve of any given genus @xcite , higher rank brill - noether theory @xcite , the proof of transversality of some brill - noether loci @xcite and the study of rational curves on hyperkhler manifolds of @xmath18}$]-type @xcite .",
    "our aim is to initiate the study of curves on abelian surfaces and provide a first application by exhibiting components of the brill - noether locus having the expected codimension in the moduli space of curves .",
    "further applications to generalized kummer manifolds will appear in @xcite .",
    "the main issue is that , unlike @xmath13 surfaces , abelian surfaces are irregular ; in particular , vector bundles techniques  la lazarsfeld on abelian surfaces do not work as nicely as on @xmath13 surfaces ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , remark [ rem : optimusprime ] and example [ cex2 ] ) .    from now on ,",
    "the pair @xmath14 will be a general @xmath2-polarized abelian surface ; following @xcite , we denote by @xmath19 the continuous system parametrizing curves in the linear system @xmath4 and in all of its translates by points of @xmath0 , and by @xmath20 the arithmetic genus of any curve in @xmath19 .    for fixed @xmath21",
    ", we consider the severi varieties @xmath22 and @xmath23 parametrizing integral @xmath3-nodal curves in @xmath4 and @xmath19 , respectively ; they are locally closed in @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath19 ) and have expected codimension @xmath3 .",
    "recently , dedieu and sernesi @xcite proved that any integral curve @xmath24 deforms to a nodal curve of the same geometric genus , unless the normalization of @xmath25 is trigonal .",
    "however , the nonemptiness problem for @xmath23 is still open and we solve it by proving the following :    [ thm : main1 ] let @xmath14 be a general polarized abelian surface with @xmath1 of type @xmath2 .",
    "then , for any integer @xmath3 such that @xmath26 , the severi variety @xmath23 ( respectively , @xmath22 ) is nonempty and smooth of dimension @xmath27 ( resp . , @xmath28 ) .",
    "note that the bound on @xmath3 is also necessary since @xmath29 .",
    "the condition of being smooth of the expected dimension is often referred to as being _",
    "regular_.    given theorem [ thm : main1 ] , it is natural to investigate the variation in moduli of nodal curves lying on abelian surfaces . in other words ,",
    "one is interested in the dimension of the locus @xmath30 parametrizing curves in @xmath31 that admit a nodal model ( of arithmetic genus @xmath32 ) which is a hyperplane section of some @xmath2-polarized abelian surface .",
    "a simple count of parameters shows that this dimension is at most @xmath33 ( cf . ",
    "[ sec : modular ] ) and we prove that the bound is effective :    [ thm : moduli ] for any @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the locus @xmath30 of curves in @xmath31 admitting a @xmath36-nodal model as a hyperplane section of some @xmath2-polarized abelian surface has a component of dimension @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , a general curve in such a component occurs as the normalization of a nodal hyperplane section of only finitely many @xmath2-polarized abelian surfaces .",
    "analogous results for smooth curves on @xmath13 surfaces are due to mori and mukai @xcite and there have been recent advances in the case of nodal curves @xcite . on the contrary , nothing was known so far for ( even smooth ) curves lying on abelian surfaces , except in the principally polarized case .",
    "another relevant question is whether any genus @xmath7 curve in @xmath19 can be deformed equigenerically to a nodal curve in @xmath19 ( classically known for plane curves @xcite and is currently being studied for curves on other surfaces @xcite ) .",
    "an affirmative answer would imply that severi varieties provide essential information about equigeneric families of curves in @xmath19 .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case for @xmath37 , thus proving conjecture c in @xcite on a general @xmath2-polarized surface .",
    "[ thm : conjds ] let @xmath14 be a general polarized abelian surface of type @xmath2 . if @xmath38 , then the locus of curves in @xmath19 with geometric genus @xmath7 lies in the zariski closure of the severi variety @xmath39 .",
    "the theorem also holds for @xmath14 a general primitively polarized @xmath13 surface , cf .",
    "remark [ rem : anchek3 ] .    henceforth , we focus on the brill - noether theory of curves in @xmath4 .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the brill - noether loci parametrizing smooth curves @xmath40 carrying a linear series of type @xmath9 .",
    "[ thm : main4 ] let @xmath14 be a general polarized abelian surface with @xmath1 of type @xmath2 , and fix integers @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "then the following hold :    * for a general @xmath40 , the brill - noether variety @xmath43 is equidimensional of dimension @xmath44 if @xmath45 , and empty otherwise ; * if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then the brill - noether locus @xmath8 has an irreducible component @xmath48 of the expected dimension @xmath49 ; furthermore , @xmath48 can be chosen so that , if @xmath50 is general , then @xmath43 has some @xmath51-dimensional components parametrizing linear series that define birational maps to @xmath52 as soon as @xmath53 ; * the locus @xmath8 is empty if @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , this proves that a general curve in the linear system is brill - noether general , in analogy with lazarsfeld s famous result .",
    "however , contrary to the @xmath13 case , there are subloci in @xmath4 which parametrize curves carrying linear series with negative brill - noether number .",
    "paris @xcite had already proved , by completely different methods ( fourier - mukai transforms ) , parts ( i ) , under the additional technical hypothesis @xmath55 , and ( iii ) ( however , we obtain ( iii ) even for torsion free sheaves on singular curves , cf .",
    "theorem [ thm : necex ] , and a stronger bound in theorem [ thm : necexforte ] ) .",
    "we believe that the totally new result ( ii ) concerning negative brill - noether numbers is the most striking .",
    "first of all , it prevents both the gonality and the clifford index of smooth curves in @xmath4 from being constant ( cf .",
    "remark [ rem : nonconst ] ) ; this is a major difference between the abelian and the @xmath13 world .",
    "secondly and most importantly , it has quite a strong implication for the geometry of the brill - noether loci @xmath10 in the moduli space of smooth irreducible genus @xmath6 curves @xmath11 . in stating it , we let @xmath56 be the scheme parametrizing pairs @xmath57 , \\gg)$ ] with @xmath58\\in \\m_p$ ] and @xmath59 , and denote by @xmath60 the natural projection .",

    "furthermore , @xmath62 coincides with the image under @xmath64 of an irreducible component @xmath65 of @xmath56 of the same dimension as @xmath62 such that , if @xmath66 is general and @xmath53 , then @xmath67 defines a birational map to @xmath52 .",
    "steffen @xcite proved that , as soon as @xmath68 , the codimension in @xmath11 of any component of @xmath10 is bounded from above by @xmath69 .",
    "however , the problem concerning nonemptiness of @xmath10 and existence of components having the expected dimension is highly nontrivial and has a complete answer only for @xmath70 .",
    "for arbitrary @xmath71 the picture is well - understood only if @xmath72 : in the former case @xmath10 is an irreducible divisor @xcite and in the latter case every component of @xmath10 has codimension @xmath73 @xcite . for very negative values of @xmath44 , there are plenty of examples of brill - nother loci exceeding the expected dimension , e.g. , constructed by considering multiples of linear series or complete intersection curves .",
    "on the other hand , for slightly negative values of @xmath44 , steffen s dimensional estimate is still expected to be effective @xcite .",
    "sernesi @xcite , followed by other authors , most recently pflueger @xcite , proved the existence of components of @xmath10 of the expected dimension under certain assumptions on @xmath74 .",
    "however , ( infinitely ) many components detected by our theorem [ thm : main5 ] were heretofore unknown ( cf .",

    ", the inequality @xmath78 implies the condition @xmath79 in ( ii ) in precisely this range . on the other hand , for @xmath80 ,",
    "the situation is more complicated and , as soon as @xmath53 , the condition @xmath77 is no longer sufficient for nonemptiness of @xmath8 ( cf .",

    "the situation for @xmath119 is slightly more involved combinatorially , but the idea is the same .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main4 ] is more demanding . a first obstacle in understanding whether a limit curve @xmath120 as above defines a point of @xmath121 lies in the fact that linear series of type @xmath9 on smooth curves might tend to torsion free ( not necessarily locally free ) sheaves on @xmath116 .",

    "<S> however , as soon as the brill - noether number is negative and some other inequalities are satisfied , the locus @xmath8 of smooth curves in @xmath4 possessing a @xmath9 is nonempty and has a component of the expected dimension . as an application , we obtain the existence of a component of the brill - noether locus @xmath10 having the expected codimension in the moduli space of curves @xmath11 . for @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> the results are generalized to nodal curves . </S>"
