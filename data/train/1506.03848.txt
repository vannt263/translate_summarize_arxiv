    "in the present paper we deal with the heun functions which are solutions of the equation introduced by karl heun in 1889 @xcite as a generalization of the hypergeometric equation .",
    "heun s equation is the most general fuchsian equation of second order with four regular singular points ; we refer to @xcite for a comprehensive mathematical treatment of the topic . at the same time",

    "now the heun equation appears in many fields of modern physics and it is used to describe a wide variety of physical phenomena  a comprehensive literature on physical applications can be found in @xcite . as a good source of information on the current development of the field one",

    "however , the code is far from being perfect , it is not difficult to encounter problems , when for ordinary parameters , at regular points the routine returns infinities or spends tens seconds with no result . the quality of the code is a serious obstacle for ( potentially very numerous ) applications of the functions .",
    "improving the situation is virtually impossible because the code is not publicly available .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to develop alternative algorithms for numerical evaluation of the heun functions .",
    "we suggest a procedure based on power series expansions and analytic continuation which allows us to avoid numerical integration of the differential equation and to achieve reasonable efficiency and accuracy .",
    "program code is presented in @xcite .",

    "we also define their single - valued counterparts by fixation of branch cuts .",
    "( notably , in most studies of the heun functions the subject is not discussed ; the author has also been unable to find information on branch cuts in maple s documentation on the heun function . ) for the single - valued functions an improvement of the algorithm for points close to the singular ones is described .",
