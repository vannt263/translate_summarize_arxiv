    "the proper euclidean geometry has been constructed by euclid many years ago .",
    "the euclidean geometry may be considered as a set of many algorithms , which are necessary for construction of geometrical objects @xmath7 and relations @xmath8 between them .",
    "these algorithms of the geometrical objects construction were obtained by means of logical reasonings from fundamental propositions ( axioms ) of euclidean geometry .",
    "any algorithm @xmath9 of construction of some geometrical object @xmath7 may be considered as an operator @xmath10 , acting on the set @xmath11 of points @xmath12 , where the geometry is constructed .",
    "the objects , which undergo the action of operators , are called operands . in the given case",
    "the points @xmath12 of the set @xmath11 are operands of algorithms of the euclidean geometry construction .",
    "there is a necessity in construction of generalized ( non - euclidean ) geometries , which are distinguished from the proper euclidean geometry in different aspects .",
    "for instance , a generalized geometry is necessary for description of properties of the real space - time .    in the beginning of 20th century there existed the problem of motion of bodies with very high speed .",
    "this problem was solved by a construction of the relativity theory , where the direct product of time and the euclidean space was substituted by the minkowski geometry of the space - time .",
    "another problem of the beginning of 20th century : stochastic motion of particle with small mass also should be solved by means of a modification of the space - time geometry .",
    "the fact is that the motion of free particles is determined _ only by the properties of the space - time _ ( or by properties of its geometry ) .",
    "intensity of the stochastic component of the particle motion depends on the particle mass .",
    "this intensity is very small for particles of large mass , and it is essential for particles of small mass .",
    "it means that in the corresponding space - time geometry the free particle motion is to be primordially stochastic , and the particle mass is to be geometrized , to take into account the influence of the mass upon the free motion . in the beginning of 20th century",
    "there was not such a geometry in the framework of the riemannian geometries .",
    "furthermore , one could not imagine such a deterministic space - time geometry , where the motion of free particles be stochastic .",
    "one tried to solve the problem , using stochastic space - time geometry @xcite .",
    "however , the stochastic geometry is not a geometry in the precise value of the word .",
    "the stochastic geometry is the usual space - time geometry ( for instance , minkowski geometry ) with some additional structure , given on the space - time .    as a result",
    "the problem of the stochastic particle motion had not been solved on the fundamental level ( by a modification of the space - time geometry ) .",
    "instead , the stochastic manifestation of the space - time geometry properties was prescribed to the free particle in the form of quantum properties , generated by the quantum principles .",
    "introduction of quantum principles admitted one to explain all nonrelativistic quantum effects .",
    "however , the relativistic quantum effects can not be described on the basis of the quantum principles , because quantum principles are nonrelativistic .",
    "to expand quantum theory to relativistic phenomena , one needs to return on the fundamental level , i. e. to the true space - time geometry , which is valid for both relativistic and nonrelativistic phenomena",
    ".    conventional method of the generalized geometry construction is a modification of the euclidean algorithms .",
    "one changes some euclidean axioms . besides , one uses deformation of the euclidean space .",
    "the infinitesimal euclidean distance @xmath13 is substituted by means of the riemannian one @xmath14 . in general , the euclidean algorithm of the geometry construction is replaced by another one .",
    "the new algorithm is used for construction of the generalized geometry . to construct the generalized geometry ( for instance , the riemannian geometry ) , one repeats many ( sometimes almost all ) euclidean logical reasonings .",
    "such a method is very complicated . besides , it is necessary , that independent modifications of different euclidean axioms be compatible between themselves .",
    "there is another method of the euclidean geometry generalization .",
    "we do not change the euclidean algorithms of the geometry construction .",
    "however , we replace operands of the euclidean algorithms .",
    "we use the world function @xmath4 as the operand of the euclidean algorithms instead of the set @xmath11 of points @xmath12 , which are usually is used as operands of the euclidean algorithms .    the world function @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the distance between the points @xmath12,@xmath17 .",
    "( we do not use the term metric for @xmath18 , because the metric is supposed to be restricted by constraint of positivity and by the triangle axiom , whereas the distance @xmath18 is free of these constraints . ) the world function @xmath4 defined by the relation @xmath19 the world function was introduced by synge @xcite , and it is a very important quantity in the proper euclidean geometry . but the world function @xmath4 is not only an important quantity .",
    "it is the _ only important _ quantity in the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "it means that the proper euclidean geometry and all its algorithms may be described in terms and only in terms of the euclidean world function @xmath2 .",
    "the property of a geometry to be described completely in terms and only in terms of the world function is called the @xmath4-immanence property .",
    "description of a geometry in terms of the world function is the @xmath4-immanent description of the geometry .",
    "the @xmath4-immanence property of the euclidean geometry was discovered rather recently @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that the euclidean geometry can be presented in terms and only in terms of the function @xmath20 , provided the function @xmath2 satisfies a series of constraints , written in terms of @xmath2 . by definition , _",
    "any geometry is a totality of all geometric objects _",
    "@xmath21 _ _  and of all relations _ _ @xmath22 _ _  between them__. the @xmath4-immanence of the proper euclidean geometry means that any geometric object @xmath7 and any relation @xmath8 of the euclidean geometry @xmath23 can be presented in terms of the euclidean world function @xmath2 in the form @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "let us suppose that a geometry @xmath5 has the property of the @xmath26-immanence .",
    "then the geometry @xmath5 may be constructed as a result of a deformation of the proper euclidean geometry @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , the proper euclidean geometry @xmath23 is the totality of geometrical objects @xmath24 and relations @xmath25 .",
    "we produce the change    @xmath27    then totality of geometrical objects @xmath28 , relations @xmath29 and the world function @xmath4 form the generalized geometry @xmath5 .",
    "any generalized geometry , obtained by the method ( [ h1.2 ] ) will be referred to as a tubular geometry ( t - geometry ) @xcite .",
    "note that the geometrical objects @xmath24 , @xmath30 and relations @xmath25 , @xmath29 are constructed by means the same algorithm of the euclidean geometry construction . only operands @xmath20 and @xmath4 are different in the two cases . thus , different generalized geometries @xmath31 and @xmath32 are distinguished by the value of their operands @xmath33 and @xmath34 , but not by the algorithms of their construction .",
    "it is very convenient , because a change of operand is more simpler , than a change of an algorithm .",
    "we may not care for compatibility of different changes of the euclidean algorithms , as it takes place at the conventional approach to a construction of a generalized geometry , when we change the algorithm at the constant operand .",
    "besides , we can evaluate the power of the set of generalized geometries , which can be considered as a power of the set of functions of two arguments .",
    "the power of this set is much more , than the power of the set of all riemannian geometries , which can be evaluated as the power of the set of several functions of one argument .",
    "for instance , the set of all homogeneous isotropic t - geometries is determined by a function of one argument , whereas the set of all homogeneous isotropic riemannian geometries is labelled by the dimension @xmath35 and the index @xmath36 .    from practical point of view",
    ", the t - geometries are interesting in the relation , that they contains such space - time geometries , where the motion of free particle is primordially stochastic .",
    "furthermore , the space - time t - geometry with stochastic motion of free particle is a general case , whereas the space - time t - geometry with deterministic motion of free particle is a degenerate case .",
    "further we shall formulate the principal theorem on the @xmath4-immanence of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "but at first , we put the cases of @xmath4-immanent description of objects of the proper euclidean geometry    let @xmath25 be the scalar product @xmath37 of two vectors @xmath38 , @xmath39 in @xmath23 .",
    "it can be written in the @xmath4-immanent form ( i.e. in terms of the world function @xmath2 ) @xmath40 where index e shows that the quantity relates to the euclidean geometry .",
    "it is easy to see that ( [ h1.3 ] ) is a corollary of the euclidean relations @xmath41",
    "@xmath42    according to ( [ h1.2 ] ) in the generalized geometry @xmath5 we obtain instead of ( [ h1.3 ] ) @xmath43    such a way of the generalized geometry construction is very simple . it does not use any logical reasonings . it is founded on the supposition that _ any generalized geometry has the _",
    "@xmath4__-immanence property__. it uses essentially the fact that the algorithms of the proper euclidean geometry construction are already known , and all necessary logical reasonings has been already produced in the proper euclidean geometry .    the application of the replacement ( [ h1.2 ] ) to the construction of a generalized geometry will be referred to as the deformation principle .",
    "any change of distance @xmath18 , or the world function @xmath4 between the points of the space @xmath11 means a deformation of this space .",
    "we construe the concept of deformation in a broad sense .",
    "the deformation may transform a point into a surface and a surface into a point .",
    "the deformation may remove some points of the euclidean space , violating its continuity , or decreasing its dimension .",
    "the deformation may add supplemental points to the space , increasing its dimension .",
    "we may interpret any @xmath4-immanent generalization of the euclidean geometry as its deformation .",
    "in other words , the deformation principle is a very general method of the generalized geometry construction .",
    "construction of a nonhomogeneous geometry on the axiomatic basis is impossible practically , because there is a lot of different nonhomogeneous geometries .",
    "it is very difficult to invent axiomatics for a nonhomogeneous geometry , where identical objects have different properties in various places . besides",
    ", one can not invent axiomatics for each of these geometries .",
    "thus , in reality there is no alternative to application of the deformation principle at the construction of the nonhomogeneous generalized geometry .",
    "the real problem consists in the sequential application of the deformation principle .",
    "as far as the _ deformation principle alone is sufficient for the construction of the t - geometry _ , one may not use additional means of the geometry construction . at the t - geometry construction",
    "we do not use coordinate system and other means of description .",
    "mathematicians provide physicists with their geometrical construction , and physicists believe that the space - time is continuous .",
    "continuity of the space - time can not be tested experimentally , and the only reason of the space - time continuity is the fact that mathematicians are able to construct only continuous geometries , whereas they fail to construct discrete geometries .",
    "we have the same situation with the space dimension .",
    "geometers consider the dimension to be an inherent property of any geometry .",
    "they can imagine the @xmath44-dimensional riemannian geometry , but they can not imagine a geometry without a dimension , or a geometry of an indefinite dimension .",
    "the reason of these belief is the fact that the dimension of the manifold and its continuity are the starting points of the riemannian geometry construction , and at this point one can not separate the properties of the geometry from the properties of the manifold .    in the t - geometry",
    "we deal only with the geometry in itself , because it does not use any means of the description . as a result",
    "the t - geometry is insensitive to continuity or discreteness of the space , as well as to its dimension .",
    "application of additional means of description can lead to inconsistency and to a restriction of the list of possible t - geometries .",
    "any generalization of the proper euclidean geometry is founded on some property of the euclidean geometry ( or its objects ) .",
    "this property is conserved in all generalized geometries , whereas other properties of the euclidean geometry are varied .",
    "character and properties of the obtained generalized geometry depend essentially on the choice of the conserved property of the basic euclidean geometry .",
    "for instance , the riemannian geometry is such a generalization of the euclidean one , where the one - dimensionality and continuity of the euclidean straight line are conserved , whereas its curvature and torsion are varied .",
    "the straight line is considered to be the principal geometric object of the euclidean geometry , and one supposes that such properties of the euclidean straight line as continuity and one - dimensionality ( absence of thickness ) are to be conserved at the generalization .",
    "it means that the continuity and one - dimensionality of the straight line are to be the principal concepts of the generalized geometry ( the riemannian geometry ) . in accordance with such a choice of the conserved geometrical object one",
    "introduces the concept of the curve @xmath45 as a continuous mapping of a segment of the real axis onto the space @xmath11@xmath46 \\rightarrow \\omega   \\label{g1.1}\\ ] ] to introduce the concept of the continuity , which is a basic concept of the generalization , one introduces the topological space , the dimension of the space @xmath11 and other basic concepts of the riemannian geometry , which are necessary for construction of the riemannian generalization of the euclidean geometry",
    ". however , these properties are not necessary for the t - geometry construction .",
    "the @xmath4-immanence of the euclidean geometry is a property of the whole euclidean geometry . using the @xmath4-immanence for generalization",
    ", we do not impose any constraints on the single geometric objects of the euclidean geometry . as a result",
    "the @xmath4-immanent generalization appears to be a very powerful generalization . besides , from the common point of view the application of the whole geometry property for the generalization seems to be more reasonable , than a use of the properties of a single geometric object .",
    "thus , using the property of the whole euclidean geometry , the @xmath4-immanent generalization seems to be more reasonable , than the riemannian generalization , which uses the properties of the euclidean straight line .",
    "now we list the most attractive features of the @xmath4-immanent generalization of the euclidean geometry :    1 .",
    "the @xmath4-immanent generalization uses the @xmath4-immanence , which is a property of the euclidean geometry as a whole ( but not a property of a single geometric object as it takes place at the riemannian generalization ) .",
    "2 .   the @xmath4-immanent generalization does not use any logical construction , and the @xmath4-immanent generalization is automatically as consistent , as the euclidean geometry , whose axiomatics is used implicitly . in particular",
    ", the t - geometry does not contain any theorems . as a result",
    "the main problem of the t - geometry is a correct @xmath4-immanent description of geometrical objects and relations of the euclidean geometry .",
    "there are some subtleties in such a @xmath4-immanent description , which are discussed below .",
    "the @xmath4-immanent generalization is a very powerful generalization .",
    "it varies practically all properties of the euclidean geometry , including such ones as the continuity and the parallelism transitivity , which are conserved at the riemannian generalization .",
    "4 .   the @xmath4-immanent generalization allows one to use the coordinateless description and to ignore the problems , connected with the coordinate transformations as well as with the transformation of other means of description .",
    "5 .   the t - geometry may be used as the space - time geometry . in this case",
    "the tubular character of straights explains freely the stochastic world lines of quantum microparticles .",
    "considering the quantum constant @xmath47 as an attribute of the space - time geometry , one can obtain the quantum description as the statistical description of the stochastic world lines @xcite .",
    "such a space - time geometry can not be obtained in the framework of the riemannian generalization of the euclidean geometry .",
    "practically all above mentioned properties of the @xmath4-immanent generalization are corollaries of the fact , that the world function @xmath4 is an operand in the algorithms of the proper euclidean geometry construction .",
    "the @xmath4-space @xmath49 is the set @xmath11 of points @xmath12 with the given world function @xmath4 @xmath50    let the proper euclidean geometry be given on the set @xmath11 , and the quantity @xmath51 be the euclidean distance between the points @xmath52 .",

    "producing the change @xmath88 in the statement @xmath0 , we obtain corresponding statement @xmath6 of another t - geometry @xmath5 , described by the world function @xmath4 .",
    "in the t - geometry the geometric object @xmath21 is described by means of the skeleton - envelope method @xcite .",

    "the finite set @xmath89 of parameters of the envelope function @xmath90 is the skeleton of elementary geometric object ( ego ) @xmath91 .",
    "the set @xmath92 of points forming ego is called the envelope of its skeleton @xmath93 . in the continuous generalized geometry",
    "the envelope @xmath1 is usually a continual set of points .",

    "each of arguments @xmath100 is a @xmath4-function of two arguments @xmath101 , either belonging to skeleton @xmath93 , or coinciding with the running point @xmath102 .",
    "thus , any elementary geometric object @xmath1 is determined by its skeleton and its envelope function as the set of zeros of the envelope function @xmath103    for instance , the cylinder @xmath104 with the points @xmath52 on the cylinder axis and the point @xmath105 on its surface is determined by the relation @xmath106 @xmath107 here @xmath108 is the area of triangle with vertices at the points @xmath109 .",
    "the equality @xmath110 means that the distance between the point @xmath105 and the axis , determined by the vector @xmath38 is equal to the distance between @xmath102 and the axis .",

    "in particular , it is determined in the proper euclidean geometry , where we can obtain its meaning .",
    "we interpret the elementary geometrical object @xmath1 , using our knowledge of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "thus , the proper euclidean geometry is used as a sample geometry for interpretation of any generalized geometry . in particular ,",
    "the cylinder ( [ g3.1 ] ) is determined uniquely in any t - geometry with any world function @xmath111    in the euclidean geometry the points @xmath54 and @xmath55 determine the cylinder axis .",
    "the shape of a cylinder depends on its axis and radius , but not on the disposition of points @xmath52 on the cylinder axis . as a result in the euclidean geometry the cylinders",

    "thereafter we deform them , replacing the euclidean world function @xmath2 by the world function @xmath4 of the geometry in question . in practice the construction of the elementary geometric object",

    "thus , a use of additional means of description restricts the list of possible generalized geometries .",
    "for instance , if we use the coordinate description at construction of the generalized geometry , the obtained geometry appears to be continuous , because description by means of the coordinates is effective only for continuous geometries , where the number of coordinates coincides with the geometry dimension .",

    "if we introduce additional structure ( for instance , a topological structure ) we obtain a fortified geometry , i.e. a generalized geometry with additional structure on it .",

    "let , for instance , we use concept of a curve @xmath45 ( [ g1.1 ] ) for construction of a generalized geometry . the concept of curve @xmath45 , considered as a continuous mapping , is a topological structure , which can not be expressed only via the distance or via the world function .",
