    "dilute iii - n - v alloys with the group - v cations partially substituted by nitrogen , e.g. , gaasn and ingaasn , have recently attracted particular attention owing to a number of their unusual properties .",
    "thus , an increase of nitrogen content in the alloy is accompanied by an anomalous reduction of the fundamental band gap , by more than 0.1ev per 1% of n as the nitrogen concentration increases from zero up to 4%   @xcite , as well as by a drastic increase of the electron effective mass and enhanced nonparabolicity of the @xmath7 conduction band @xcite ( for reviews , see also @xcite ) .",
    "these specific properties are related to the n - substitution - induced resonant electronic states within the conduction band continuum and an anticrossing of the localized nitrogen states with the extended conduction states of the semiconductor matrix @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the available experimental data are consistent with the simple phenomenological band anticrossing ( bac ) model which takes into account the anticrossing hybridization only with the levels of isolated ( single ) nitrogen atoms @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the two hybridized conduction bands , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are formed .",
    "as the nitrogen concentration increases , the lower band , @xmath9 , shifts down in energy reducing the fundamental energy - band gap @xmath10 .",
    "simultaneously , the band - bottom effective mass becomes heavier and the nonparabolicity coefficient rises considerably .",
    "the band - structure modification involves a remarkable change in the gyromagnetic factor , @xmath0 , of electrons in the conduction band @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the change is caused by two reasons .",
    "firstly , as in the case of conventional alloys in@xmath6ga@xmath5as , the band - gap shrinkage leads to a monotonous downward shift of the effective @xmath0-factor below the value of _ g_-factor in gaas matrix ( @xmath11 in gaas at helium temperature ) @xcite .",
    "secondly , the coupling with isolated nitrogen levels , with the land factor being positive and close to the electron @xmath0-factor in vacuum @xmath12 , tends to shift the _",
    "g _ value upwards , as it has been first found experimentally in ingaasn when studying the dependence of the absorption coefficient on the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the two effects have opposite signs and partially compensate each other .",
    "the bac model predicts an initial growth in the dependence @xmath13 @xcite . the dependence is smooth and ,",
    "as calculated for gaas@xmath5n@xmath6 in @xcite , it has a maximum value @xmath14 at @xmath15 . at the same time , detailed measurement and comparison of the left- and right - circularly polarized photoluminescence spectra performed in gaas@xmath5n@xmath6 in a longitudinal magnetic field at helium temperature for @xmath16 have shown that _",
    "g _ grows sharply with increasing @xmath17 , reverses its sign from negative to positive at @xmath18 , reaches a value of 0.7 in the range @xmath19 and retains that value with small deviations as @xmath17 increases up to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "such an abrupt dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath17 at small @xmath17 has been interpreted in terms of a modified @xmath21 model @xcite .",
    "this model takes into account the hybridization of the host conduction band not only with the localized levels due to single n atoms but also with the levels which are formed by clusters of n atoms , pairs and triplets , and lie closer to the conduction - band bottom .",
    "the data on the @xmath0-factor in gaas@xmath5n@xmath6 with high nitrogen concentration are highly desirable for the purpose of checking various theoretical models . however , to the best of our knowledge",
    ", such experimental data for @xmath22 are lacking .    in the present work",
    "the sign of the electron @xmath0-factor in the gaas@xmath5n@xmath6 conduction band has been measured at room temperature for @xmath23 . to this end",
    ", we used the dependence of the sign of the asymmetry of hanle effect of optically spin - polarized electrons , measured under oblique excitation , on the @xmath0-factor sign .",
    "this method is based on the relationship between the direction of larmor precession of electron spin in a magnetic field and the @xmath0-factor sign . as compared to other methods ,",
    "this method is advantageous for studying crystals with high nitrogen content , particularly at high ( up to room ) temperatures when the photoluminescence occurs over a broad spectrum .",
    "the fundamentals of the method are presented in section 3 , together with the discussion of peculiarities of the electron spin polarization and the oblique hanle effect caused by the splitting of the @xmath24 valence band due to a uniaxial strain of the gaasn films grown on gaas substrates .",
    "section 4 provides the theory extended in order to calculate the magnitude and orientation of photoelectron spin polarization , the circular polarization of photoluminescence and the hanle - curve shape as a function of the energy of absorbed and emitted photons in a uniaxially strained semiconductor with the top of the light - hole subband to be higher in energy than the top of the heavy - hole subband .    in the gaasn alloys under study",
    ", the optical spin polarization of conduction electrons at room temperature has been found to be anomalously high  @xcite .",
    "this is the result of spin - dependent recombination of polarized conduction electrons on deep paramagnetic centers which apparently appear during the introduction of nitrogen atoms into gaas .",
    "the capture of free electrons is accompanied by efficient dynamic spin polarization of electrons bound on the centers . in its turn",
    ", the polarized centers kinetically affect the polarization of free electrons so that a strongly coupled spin system of free and localized electrons is formed .",
    "a change in the polarization of localized electrons manifests itself in a remarkable change of the free - electron polarization .",
    "thus , from the analysis of the curve of magnetic depolarization of the interband photoluminescence contributed by free particles , one can determine the @xmath0-factor signs of both free and bound electrons .",
    "in section 5 we present experimental results together with the results of numerical calculation taking into account the influence of spin - dependent recombination on the electron spin polarization .",
    "we studied the undoped @xmath25m - thick gaas@xmath1n@xmath2 layer grown by rf - plasma - assisted solid - source molecular - beam epitaxy at 350450@xmath26c on semi - insulating ( 001 ) gaas substrate @xcite .",
    "the nitrogen content and crystallinity of the grown layer were examined by x - ray diffraction technique .",
    "the as - grown structure was annealed for 5min at 700@xmath26c in a flow of arsenic in the growth chamber .",
    "continuous - wave tunable ti : sapphire laser was used for photoluminescence ( pl ) excitation .",
    "spin polarization of electrons was created upon the interband absorption of circularly polarized light @xcite .",
    "it was monitored by measuring the degree of circular polarization of pl , defined as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the right ( @xmath30 ) and left ( @xmath31 ) circularly polarized pl components .",
    "the value @xmath32 and pl intensity in a wavelength range up to 1.4@xmath33 m were measured using a high - sensitive polarization analyzer @xcite comprising a quartz polarization modulator @xcite , a lock - in two - channel photon counter , and a photomultiplier with an ingaasp photocathode .",
    "the measurements were carried out at 300k .",
    "spectral dependencies of the pl intensity ( solid curve ) and of the pl circular polarization degree ( circles ) for the gaas@xmath1n@xmath2 layer under normal incidence ( @xmath34 ) of the pump beam and detection of the pl",
    ". excitation energy @xmath35ev .",
    "arrows indicate the pl detection energies @xmath36 and @xmath37 at which the hanle curves presented in fig .  2 are measured . ]",
    "figure[pl^ro(det ) ] shows the spectra of pl intensity ( solid curve ) and of pl circular polarization degree ( circles ) measured in gaas@xmath1n@xmath2 layer under normal incidence of the pump beam and the detection of luminescence along the growth axis .",
    "the pl spectrum consists of two strongly overlapping inhomogeneously broadened bands where the low - energy pl band is negatively polarized ( relative to the polarization of the exciting beam ) , whereas the high - energy band is polarized positively .",
    "as we have shown earlier @xcite , the two pl bands appear due to splitting of the light- and heavy - hole valence subbands induced by uniaxial compression along the growth axes of gaas@xmath5n@xmath6 film grown on gaas substrate . in its turn",
    ", this compression arises from large lattice mismatch between the film and substrate .",
    "the crystal splitting of the pl bands , @xmath38 , increases with increase of the nitrogen content and at @xmath23 equals 29mev .",
    "an interrelation of the sign of the pl circular polarization and the type of recombination transition in gaas@xmath5n@xmath6 is considered in detail in @xcite . under simultaneous excitation of electrons from both valence subbands , realized in fig.[pl^ro(det ) ] , the negative and positive pl polarizations are due to recombination of conduction electrons with the light and heavy holes , respectively . since under an uniaxial compression the top of the light - hole subband is situated above the top of the heavy - hole subband @xcite , the low - energy pl band is polarized negatively .    in bulk",
    "semiconductor , the spin relaxation rate of conduction electrons grows dramatically with temperature and decreases electron polarization down to units and fractions of @xmath39 at room temperature @xcite . at the same time , the absolute values both of negative and positive polarization in fig.[pl^ro(det ) ] reach @xmath40 , which is near to the maximal magnitude of @xmath41 determined by selection rules .",
    "such anomalous enhancement of free electron polarization in gaasn is due to dynamic polarization of electrons bound on deep paramagnetic centers @xcite .",
    "the paramagnetic centers arise with an incorporation of nitrogen in gaas and are polarized as a result of spin - dependent capture on them of the polarized conduction electrons .",
    "the polarized centers increase the free electron polarization which can reach @xmath42 at strong pumping .",
    "the hanle effect is a depolarization of photoluminescence by a magnetic field @xmath43 directed perpendicular to continuous - wave pump beam @xcite .",
    "the effect originates from larmor precession of electron spins , which destroys their polarization . in the simplest case ,",
    "hanle effect is described by lorentzian @xmath44 with half - width at half maximum , @xmath45 , where @xmath0 is the electron land @xmath0-factor , @xmath46 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath47 is the electron spin - polarization lifetime .",
    "figure[0teta ] shows the hanle curves measured in gaas@xmath1n@xmath2 for the positive ( a ) and negative ( b ) pl polarization under the normal incidence of pump light onto the sample and the detection of the pl in the opposite direction ( backscattering configuration ) .",
    "the measurements were carried out with the energy of the excitation quantum @xmath35ev , at which the conduction electrons are excited from both valence subbands .",
    "one can see that for both positive and negative pl polarization the hanle curve is superimposition of the narrow and wide curves with the half - widths being different by two orders of magnitude .",
    "a qualitative explanation of such a complex shape of the @xmath48 dependency is the following .",
    "spin lifetime of electrons bound on paramagnetic centers , @xmath49 , can exceed spin lifetime of free electrons , @xmath47 , by orders of magnitude at room temperature .",
    "therefore , the half - width of hanle curve of bound electrons , @xmath50 ( here @xmath51 is the gyromagnetic _",
    "g_-factor of bound electrons ) , should be far less than the half - width of hanle curve of free electrons @xmath52 . as noted above , the spin - dependent recombination results in formation of a strongly coupled spin - system of free and bound electrons , where a variation of the polarization of the centers is accompanied by change in the free - electron polarization .",
    "due to this , the @xmath48 curve is the sum of two curves with strongly different half - widths , where the narrow curve describes the hanle effect of bound electrons and the wide curve presents depolarization of free electrons .",
    "solid curves in fig.[0teta ] are calculated using the equation @xmath53 + \\rho_{0c}/[1+(b / b_{1/2}^{c})^2]+\\rho_{\\rm res}$ ] at @xmath54 g and @xmath55 g . it is seen that the calculated curves describe reasonably the measured ones in fig.[0teta ] for both positive and negative polarization . during the calculation",
    "the fitting parameters were @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . at present , the origin of the constant polarization @xmath59 is not clear and additional studies should be done for its elucidation .     experimental hanle curves ( open circles ) measured in gaas@xmath1n@xmath2 at excitation and detection along the normal to the sample .",
    "excitation energy @xmath35ev , detection energy @xmath60 is equal to @xmath61ev  ( _ a _ ) and @xmath62ev  ( _ b _ ) .",
    "solid curves are superpositions of the calculated hanle curves for free ( dotted curves ) and bound electrons ( see text for details ) .",
    "inserts show the initial parts of the hanle curves in the range of small magnetic fields . ]",
    "the hanle effect can provide measuring the sign of the land @xmath0-factor of electrons @xcite since a rotation direction of mean electron spin in a magnetic field depends on the @xmath0-factor sign . the most suitable way to find",
    "the @xmath0-factor sign is to use a specular geometry of experiment . in this geometry ,",
    "the exciting light falls on the sample obliquely , the luminescence is detected at an angle to the exciting beam while a magnetic field is perpendicular to both the excitation and detection directions , and lies in the crystal surface plane @xcite , as shown in fig.[mirrorconfig ] .    in specular geometry",
    ", the dependence @xmath48 in bulk zinc - blende semiconductor has the form @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the angle between the directions of excitation and detection , @xmath65 is the degree of polarization for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the angle through which the mean spin @xmath69 of electrons with the _ g_-factor equal to _ g _ turns during the electron spin lifetime @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the electron lifetime and spin relaxation time in the conduction band , @xmath73 is the larmor frequency , and the born magneton @xmath74 .",
    "equation([hanlebulk ] ) was derived taking into account the fact that in a bulk unstrained gaas - type crystal the mean electron spin in the moment of creation , @xmath75 , is parallel to the exciting beam , and the degree of pl polarization is equal to the projection of @xmath69 on the direction of detection : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the unit vector along the direction of registration @xcite . at @xmath67 ,",
    "the hanle curve is a symmetrical function on magnetic field as , for example , one can see in fig.[0teta ] . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the @xmath48 plot is not symmetrical with respect to the @xmath66 point . the value of @xmath32 is larger for the magnetic field direction at which the electron spin precesses toward the luminescence observation axis .",
    "note , that for measuring the _ g_-sign it is sufficient to record the asymmetry in the dependence of the absolute value of @xmath32 on @xmath79 .     experimental configuration for the @xmath0-factor sign measurements .",
    "the angle @xmath64 is the angle between the excitation beam and the direction of the detected photoluminescence . ]",
    "the above method acquires distinctive features @xcite if the heavy and light hole subbands are split due to the uniaxial deformation in a bulk crystal or due to quantum - size effect in a nanostructure .",
    "first , in this case the direction of the mean spin of photogenerated electrons @xmath80 may not coincide with the direction of the exciting beam .",
    "theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) developed for uniaxially strained crystals yields the following expressions for the mean spins of the electrons created with @xmath81 from states close to the tops of light - hole ( @xmath82 transition ) and the heavy - hole ( @xmath83 transition ) subbands : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are unit vectors along the deformation ( growth ) axis and pump beam direction .",
    "as seen from eqs.([k0 ] ) , the spin @xmath87 is parallel to the deformation axis for any light incidence angle , whereas the angle between @xmath88 and @xmath85 is twice the angle @xmath89 between the excitation direction and the growth axis ( fig.[ezhik ] ) @xcite .",
    "the light - hole and heavy - hole splitting can be neglected if the energy of the photogenerated holes exceeds substantially the splitting energy @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "such situation can be realized when @xmath91 , where @xmath10 is the forbidden gap of the deformed crystal . in this case , the electrons are excited from both valence subbands , and , as in a bulk unstrained crystal , their mean spin @xmath92 is directed along the exciting beam : @xmath93 ( fig.[ezhik ] ) .",
    "thus , with the increase of excitation energy from @xmath94 towards @xmath95 , the spin @xmath96 changes from @xmath88 to @xmath97 rotating counterclockwise through angle ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "scheme of orientation of spins @xmath99 , @xmath88 , @xmath97 and vectors @xmath100 , @xmath101 with respect to the directions @xmath102 of excitation , @xmath103 of detection and @xmath85 of deformation ( @xmath85 is a perpendicular to the sample surface ) in the case of specular configuration . ]",
    "second , in the case of valence - subband splitting , the pl polarization is determined by projection of @xmath104 not on the direction of observation @xmath103 , as this should be for a bulk unstrained semiconductor , but rather on the vector @xmath105 , which depends on the angle between @xmath103 and @xmath85 vectors and on the actual recombination energy @xcite : @xmath106 for recombination with the tops ( @xmath107 ) of the light - hole and heavy - hole subbands , the vectors @xmath101 and @xmath108 are given by the same expressions ( [ k0 ] ) as @xmath88 and @xmath87 , but with @xmath86 being replaced by @xmath103 .",
    "we readily see that @xmath108 is always parallel to the growth axis , while @xmath101 is at an angle @xmath109 to this axis ( fig.[ezhik ] ) .",
    "if the pl detection energy @xmath110 , recombination with the light - holes is only possible and , therefore , @xmath111 . when @xmath112 , the crystal valence - band splitting can be ignored and an effective direction of the pl detection , given by vector @xmath105 , coincides with the real one : @xmath113 .",
    "so , with increase of the detection energy , the vector @xmath105 changes its direction from @xmath114 to @xmath115 , rotating clockwise through angle ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "since both the value and direction of the @xmath80 and @xmath105 vectors are energy dependent , the hanle curves will be different for different excitation and detection energies .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , they can still be described by eq.([hanlebulk ] ) , provided the angle @xmath64 is replaced by the angle @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the angles between the _ z _ axis and vectors @xmath119 and @xmath96 , respectively , reckoned counterclockwise from the _ z _ axis .",
    "the above qualitative analysis of orientation of the vectors @xmath120 and the angle between them is based on eqs .  ( [ k0 ] )",
    "valid for the @xmath121-point , @xmath122 .",
    "the values of @xmath80 and @xmath105 for arbitrary frequencies @xmath123 and @xmath60 can be found taking into account the interband optical transitions with @xmath124 where the heavy- and light - hole states are mixed . such kind of calculations has been performed for unstrained bulk zinc - blende - lattice semiconductors  @xcite , strained bulk semiconductors with the top of the heavy - hole subband lying above that of the light - hole subband  @xcite , quantum - well structures in the approximation of infinitely - high barriers  @xcite and for finite barriers  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and semiconductor superlattices  @xcite .    in this section",
    "we will follow the method of ref .",
    "@xcite developed in order to calculate the optical orientation of electron spins under interband absorption of circularly polarized light normally incident on a hexagonal crystal , e.g. , cds or cdse .",
    "in fact , in @xcite the quasicubic model of the valence band structure is used : the crystal splitting of the higher two valence subbands is obtained by applying an effective uniaxial strain to a crystal of the cubic symmetry with the @xmath24 valence band . here",
    "we generalize the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to consider ( i ) the oblique incidence of the exciting light on the sample , and ( ii ) the opposite sign of the uniaxial strain resulting in the opposite sequence of the split subbands , now the light - hole subband lies above the heavy - hole subband .",
    "the spin - polarized electrons are described by the spin - density matrix @xmath125 , where @xmath126 are the spin indices .",
    "this matrix can be found from the balance matrix equation @xmath127 where the first and second terms describe the spin relaxation and larmor precession of the electron spins , and the right - hand side term is the generation rate of the electron spin - density matrix .",
