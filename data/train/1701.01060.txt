    "collective electronic oscillations on the surface of metals , dubbed surface plasma waves ( spws )  @xcite , have emerged as a pivotal player in _ _ nano__scopic manipulation of light  @xcite .",
    "the functionality of many prototypical nanophotonic devices critically relies on the distance spws can travel before they are damped out due to energy losses via several channels  @xcite .",
    "spws can lose energy due to joule heat , inter - band absorption , radiation emission and individual electronic motions ( landau damping ) .",
    "most of the losses can be efficiently but not totally reduced under appropriate circumstances .",
    "amplifiers have been contrived to compensate for the losses  @xcite , which are all extrinsic and require external agents such as a dipolar gain medium to supply the energy .",
    "the standard theory of spws was formulated shortly after their discovery in 1957  @xcite and has been comprehensively discoursed in many textbooks  @xcite . in this theory ,",

    ", electronic collisions must be sufficiently frequent so that the electronic mean free path , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fermi velocity and @xmath6 the relaxation time , is much shorter than the spw wavelength or the typical length scale of the system .",
    "the general case with arbitrary @xmath6 , especially the collision - less limit , where @xmath7 , defies these models and has yet to be entertained .",
    "other models based on _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical computations  @xcite are helpful in understanding the complexity of real materials but falls short in providing an intuitive and systematic picture of spws underpinned by electrons experiencing less frequent collisions .    in the present work we employ boltzmann s transport equation to derive a theory of spws in metals with arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "our analysis reveals a universal intrinsic amplification channel for spws .",
    "the existence of this channel does not depend on @xmath6 but is warranted by a general principle .",
    "we show that the unique interplay between ballistic electronic motions and boundaries results in an electrical current that allows a net amount of energy to be drawn from the electrons by spws , which would inevitably self - amplify in the collision - less limit , thereby destabilizing the system .",
    "the hereby predicted self - amplification of collision - less spws is analogous to the landau damping in collisionless bulk plasma waves  @xcite . while the latter is caused by slowly moving electrons that strip energy from the wave ,",
    "the former is attributable to ballistically moving electrons imparting energy to the wave when boundaries are present .    in the next section ,",

    "is a subject of crucial importance for future study .",
    "one central feature of our theory is the classification of current densities into a diffusive component @xmath57 and a surface - ballistic component @xmath69 .",
    "this classification is not based on the value of @xmath6 but according to whether the component obeys the ( generalized ) ohm s law or not .",
    "apart from this , these components are also discriminated in other ways .",
    "firstly , they are controlled by different length scales .",
    "as it largely follows the local electric field @xmath53 , the characteristic length associated with @xmath57 is @xmath224 . on the other hand ,",
    "the length for @xmath69 is @xmath225 , because of its simple @xmath84-dependence .",
    "secondly , they are oriented disparately .",
    "@xmath57 is largely oriented normal to @xmath53 locally whereas @xmath69 normal to the surfaces  especially for @xmath21 close to unity .",
    "thirdly , @xmath57 is a bulk property and exists regardless of the surface ; on the contrary , @xmath69 reflects true surface effects and it would disappear without surfaces .",
    "if we replace the vacuum by a dielectric @xmath3 , @xmath22 may be reduced by an order of  @xmath226 due to weakened @xmath227 and @xmath228 . roughly speaking ,",
    "@xmath42 present on the metal side induces mirror charges amounting to @xmath229 on the dielectric side .",
    "if @xmath42 is highly localized about the interface , as is with spws , @xmath42 and @xmath230 will combine to give a net charge of @xmath231 . as a result , @xmath232 and @xmath228",
    "will be reduced by a factor of @xmath233 .",
    "this leads to smaller @xmath22 and smaller @xmath234 . studying dielectric effects may be important in applications .",
    "another problem that needs to be addressed for experimental studies is concerned with the effects of inter - band transitions . in the most experimented materials , such as silver and gold ,",
    "these transitions are known to have dramatic effects .",
    "they not only open a loss channel due to inter - band absorption , but also significantly shift the spw frequency . including them in our formalism",
    "consists of a simple generalization : in addition to @xmath57 and @xmath69 , the total current density @xmath88 must now also have a component @xmath235 accounting for inter - band transitions .",
    "the equation of motion is obtained by substituting @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ eocc ] ) .",
    "one may write @xmath236 , where @xmath237 and the inter - band conductivity @xmath238 can in principle be calculated using greenwood - kubo formula . in practice , calculating @xmath238 could be a formidable task even for the imaginably simplest surfaces . nevertheless , one may argue that @xmath235 primarily affects the properties of bulk waves , namely , @xmath96 .",
    "the causality principle should still protect the amplification channel .",
    "a systematic analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we remark that , @xmath22 can also be calculated by studying the temporal evolution of the electrostatic potential energy of the system .",
    "in particular , equation ( [ gamma0 ] ) can be directly derived in this way .",
    "detailed calculations along this line will be published in a separate paper .    to conclude",
    ", we have presented a theory for spws taking into account the unique interplay between ballistic electronic motions and boundary effects , from which it emerges a universal self - amplification channel for these waves .",
    "it is expected that the study will bear far - reaching practical and fundamental consequences , to be explored in the future .",

    "it is easy to show that , had we assumed im@xmath261 , we would have found the opposite : the number of reflected electrons would be fixed while the number of incident electrons would go to infinity as @xmath262 , which is unphysical .",
