    "the _ permanent _ of an @xmath3 matrix @xmath4 is defined to be @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the permutation group on @xmath7 .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath8 is the @xmath9 , @xmath10 adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph @xmath11 , then @xmath12 is the number of perfect matchings of @xmath13 .",
    "the permanent of @xmath8 is syntactically similar to its determinant @xmath14 , which is a signed variation of the above sum .",
    "this mild sign variation leads to a radical change in computability : computing permanents is hard ( see [ sub.ex ] ) , whereas determinants can be computed in a polynomial time .",
    "here we are interested in the _ jones polynomial _",
    "( @xcite ) which is a celebrated invariant of links in @xmath15 .",
    "link _ is a disjoint union of embedded circles in 3-space .",
    "the jones polynomial @xmath16 of a link can be uniquely characterized by the following skein relation : @xmath17 together with the initial condition @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that the jones polynomial of a link can be computed in exponential time ( with respect to the number of crossings ) .",
    "the jones polynomial has a statistical mechanics definition , as a state sum which uses as input a planar diagram of a link .",
    "our aim is to give a permanent formula of the jones polynomial .",
    "consider a diagram @xmath19 of an oriented link @xmath0 , that is an oriented , 4-valent plane graph , where each vertex has a crossing structure of one of two types : @xmath20 we form a graph @xmath21 , from the link diagram @xmath19 , by replacing a neighbourhood of each crossing of @xmath19 with one of the graphs shown in figure  [ fig : gadget ] .",
    "we may say that @xmath21 is a blown - up version of @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath21 is an immersed directed graph with @xmath22 vertices , where @xmath1 is the number of crossings of @xmath19 .",
    "we will refer to the the two graphs shown in figure  [ fig : gadget ] , minus the incoming and outgoing edges ( which come from the link diagram ) , as _",
    "gadgets_. we emphasize the fact that the four edges in @xmath21 that enter and exit a gadget are all parallel when they meet the gadget .    in definition [ def.ww ]",
    "below , we define local weights on the edges of @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the adjacency matrix of weights of @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath23 has size the number of vertices of @xmath21 , and the @xmath24 entry of @xmath23 is the weight of the corresponding directed edge @xmath25 of @xmath21 .",
    "next theorem contains the main result of the paper .",
    "an inspiration comes from the observation ( see @xcite , @xcite ) that the weight system associated with the _ colored jones function _ is a permanent .    for every link @xmath0",
    "we have @xmath26      the first author wants to thank d. aharonov , a. barvinok , s. basu , p. buergisser , s. garoufalidis , m. jerrum , m. kiwi and p. tetali for enlightening discussions .",
    "we follow an exposition of the results of freedman , kitaev , larsen and wang ( see @xcite ) written by bordewich , freedman , lovasz and welsh ( see in particular proof of theorem 5.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "suppose that we have a bqp language and an input @xmath27 .",

    "it is also shown in @xcite that this kind of approximation of the jones polynomial ( called the _ additive approximation _ in @xcite ) is in bqp .",
    "this was proven in a different way also by aharonov , jones and landau @xcite .",
    "the bqp - hardness of approximating the jones polynomial is also discussed by aharonov and arad in @xcite .",
    "the complexity class @xmath32 consists of the counting versions of the decision problems in @xmath33 ; an example of a problem in @xmath32 is : given a graph , how many hamiltonian cycles it has ?",
    "it is considered very unlikely that @xmath34 .",
    "exact computation of the permanent of @xmath10 matrices is # p - complete ( see valiant @xcite ) and exact computation of the jones polynomial @xmath35 is @xmath36hard except when @xmath37 is a root of unity of order @xmath38 ( see jaeger , vertigan and welsh @xcite ) .",
    "kuperberg ( see @xcite ) showed that stronger than additive approximations of the jones polynomial are hard .",
    "this contrasts with the approximations of the permanents , as we explain next .",

    "unfortunately , the result of @xcite is the best possible . if one could approximate by a fpras the permanent of matrices with ( say ) integer entries , then @xmath39 .",
    "there are however several approximation algorithms for general permanents , which do not yield a polynomial - time complexity bound .",
    "perhaps the simplest one is based on the following theorem , noticed by several researchers ( hammersley , heilman , lieb , gutman , godsil ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be a matrix and let @xmath40 be the random matrix obtained from @xmath8 by taking the square root of minimal argument of each non - zero entry and then multiplying each non - zero entry by an element of @xmath41 chosen independently uniformly at random",
    ". then @xmath42 .",
    "this leads to a monte - carlo algorithm for estimating the permanent .",
    "the algorithm was described and studied first by karmarkar , karp , lipton , lovasz and luby ( see @xcite ) . clearly , for general matrices the monte - carlo algorithm described above may have to run an exponential time",
    "; however , with regard to the connection to the quantum computing , the experimental study of the algorithm applied to the particular matrices which come from knot and link diagrams is an attractive task and it is our work in progress jointly with petr plechac .",
    "let us begin by recalling the state sum definition of the jones polynomial of an oriented link , @xcite . choose a diagram @xmath19 of a link @xmath0 .",

    "the _ local weight _",
    "@xmath48 of a state @xmath44 at a vertex @xmath49 of @xmath19 ( positive or negative ) is given by @xmath50 + where @xmath51 .",
    "( these weights come from the @xmath52-matrix of the quantum group @xmath53 and we follow the conventions of @xcite ) .",
    "* @xmath54 is the _ writhe _ of @xmath19 , that is the sum of the signs of the crossings of @xmath19 . * to define the _ rotation numbers _ @xmath55 and @xmath56 of a state @xmath44",
    ", we first define the the rotation number @xmath57 of a curve @xmath58 immersed in the plane to be the @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the total rotation angle of the tangent vector of @xmath58 .",
    "( the direction of the counter - clockwise rotation is taken to be positive . )",
    "if @xmath44 is a state of @xmath19 , then @xmath61 , for @xmath62 , is the sum of the rotation numbers of each of the @xmath63-colored circles in @xmath44 .",
    "the rotation numbers can also be defined combinatorially as follows : smooth any 4-valent vertex of @xmath44 as follows : @xmath64 the result is a collection of oriented planar circles , colored by @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath61 is the number of counter - clockwise @xmath45-colored circles minus the number of clockwise @xmath63-colored circles",
    ".    it will be convenient to include the phase factors @xmath65 in the @xmath52-matrix .",
    "this can be achieved as follows : let @xmath66 be the diagram obtained by isotoping @xmath19 so that at each crossing the over and undercrossing arcs meet each other at a tangent where they cross .",
    "this means that the rotation number of a cycle @xmath67 of @xmath19 equals to @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the rotation number of the edge @xmath70 of @xmath66 corresponding to edge @xmath71 of @xmath19 .",
    "now , for a state @xmath44 and a vertex @xmath49 of @xmath19 , consider its two outgoing edges @xmath72 ( see figure [ fig : gadget ] ) and the rotation numbers @xmath73 and @xmath74 . of course , @xmath75 and @xmath76 depend on @xmath49 .",
    "we now define the modified weights @xmath77 of a state @xmath44 at a vertex @xmath49 by :    @xmath78    with these weights , we have    suppose that @xmath19 is a diagram for a link @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath66 be the diagram obtained by isotoping @xmath19 so that at each crossing the over and undercrossing arcs meet each other at a tangent where they cross .",
    "then @xmath79    if @xmath44 is a state of @xmath19 and @xmath80 is the set of @xmath63-colored circles in @xmath44 , @xmath81 then @xmath82 where the second equality follows since the four arcs entering an exiting a gadget are tangenial .",
    "this sum can be written as @xmath83 where @xmath84 ( respectively @xmath45 ) if @xmath71 lies in @xmath67 ( respectively does not lie in @xmath67 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath85    note that in this proof we used the fact that in @xmath66 , the over and undercrossing arcs meet each other at a tangent where they cross .",
    "we could avoid this tangent condition on the edges entering an exiting a crossing by adding factors to the the expressions @xmath86 that are determined by the angles formed by the crossings in @xmath19 .",
    "see @xcite for details on this type of construction .",
    "let @xmath19 be a link diagram .",
    "then we let @xmath21 denote the directed , edge - weighted graph drawn in the plane which is obtained from @xmath19 by replacing a neighbourhood of each crossing of @xmath19 with the gadgets and their incident edges as shown in figure  [ fig : gadget ] .",
    "the edge weights @xmath87 of @xmath21 are given by the convention that all of the undecorated edges have weight @xmath46 , @xmath88    @xmath89 and each edge @xmath90 coming from an edge @xmath71 of @xmath19 is assigned the weight @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a link diagram of @xmath0 and @xmath21 be the graph constructed as described in definition  [ def.ww ] .",
    "then @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the set of vertex - disjoint directed cycles that cover all vertices of @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath44 be a state of @xmath19 and @xmath94 be the corresponding state in @xmath95 ( the diagram constructed in lemma  [ lem.b ] ) .",
    "there is a correspondence between the state @xmath94 at a crossing @xmath96 and sets of vertex - disjoint directed cycles that cover all vertices of @xmath21 .",
    "this correspondence is given in the following way : if @xmath97 is an edge incident with @xmath96 in @xmath95 , and @xmath98 is the corresponding edge in @xmath21 , then the edge @xmath98 is in a cycle if and only if @xmath97 is colored by @xmath46 . the correspondence is given for a positive crossing in appendix  [ s.f ] . from the appendix",
    "it is also readily seen that at a positive crossing @xmath99 where if @xmath100 denotes the set of vertex - disjoint directed cycles that cover all vertices of @xmath21 that corresponds with the state @xmath44 , then @xmath101 denotes the set of edges of @xmath100 that belong to the gadget at the crossing @xmath49 of @xmath19 .",
    "it is readily checked that the corresponding identity also holds at negative crossings .",
    "it then follows that @xmath102 which , by lemma  [ lem.b ] , is equal to the jones polynomial , as required .",
    "we make the following definition for the matrix @xmath23 that is used in theorem  [ thm.per ] .",
    "let @xmath19 be a link diagram and @xmath21 be the associated graph constructed as in definition  [ def.ww ] .",
    "then we let @xmath23 denote the adjacency matrix of @xmath21 , whose @xmath24-entry is the weight of the directed edge @xmath24",
    ".    we can now prove theorem  [ thm.per ] .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath8 is the @xmath10 adjacency matrix of a graph , then @xmath12 is the number of collections of vertex - disjoint directed cycles that cover all vertices of the graph .",
