    "_ the economist _ @xcite is a well known weekly newspaper of economics and economics related subjects .",
    "frequently , it publishes interesting quantitative information in paper and on the web , especially in the _ daily chart _ section . in occasion of the 2014 world cup it collected the amount of goals scored during all the world cup competitions , from 1930 to 2014 , minute by minute .",
    "all the data is presented as interactive plot on the web @xcite .",
    "we give in fig.[fig : economist - reduction ] a reduction of _ the economist _ original graphic . in our plot _ additional time _ ( called _ allowance for time lost _ in fifa documentation @xcite ) and _ extra time _ are not represented .",
    "no distinction is made between _ goals _ , _ penalties _ and _ own goals_. in the original graphic it possible to see in which match each goal was scored and is possible to filter matches according to some categories .",
    "the reader interested in these facets should definitely refer to the web .",
    "all the data used for this paper and the analysis performed in _ r _",
    "@xcite software are available at _ mingotti.uc3m.es / floor1/paper - goals_.        just under the original plot the authors summarize the graphical information with the following sentence : _",
    "`` ... one can expect a rush of goals in the last ten minutes of normal time , but the 18th and 75th minutes have proved fertile''_. we consider such conclusions hurried and possibly lacking in significance . in this paper",
    "we will propose a simple and reasonable model that describes the minute by minute goal scoring frequency .",
    "after that , we reconsider how much of the original analysis can be confidently accepted .",
    "the goal scoring frequency has been already analyzed in literature for the _ national scottish league 1991 - 1992 _ in @xcite , the _",
    "australian soccer league _ in @xcite and",
    "european champions league _ in @xcite . the 1986 world cup in @xcite , 1990 world cup in @xcite and jointly 1998 , 2002 and 2006 _ world cups _ in @xcite .",
    "as far as we could establish , a comprehensive study about goal scoring frequency in all _ world cups _ till present has never been approached .",
    "article @xcite is the most similar to our work .",
    "it focuses on world cup scoring frequency and it considers more than a single tournament . the authors concluded that dividing the match in two 45-min parts , most goals were scored in the second half . dividing the match in 15-min parts , most of the goals were scored in the last period ( 76 - 90 ) and there was a trend towards more goals scored as time progressed . in this paper",
    "we will see all these conclusion can be confirmed and refined using the richer dataset of all world cups scores .",
    "from the _ the economist _ original data set we consider only goals scored in _ regular time _ , that is in minutes between @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "we ignore _ additional time _ because its occurrence is decided match per match by the referee @xcite and _ extra time _ because it depends on the scoring situation at the end of regular time .",
    "their goal scoring rate can not be directly compared with _",
    "regular time_.        we redraw the dataset in fig.[fig : economist - reduction ] with a _ loess _ smoother . in fig.[fig : loess ] the thick continuous line is the smooth _ loess _ non parametric fit for the relation between goals and minute .",
    "the dashed lines represent the average number of goals in the first and second half respectively . just under the dashed lines , on their left side ,",
    "do lay the numerical values of each mean .",
    "the parameters used for the _ loess _ are the ones default with r @xcite    from fig.[fig : loess ] we can see the average number of goals in the second half ( 28.16 ) is larger than in the first half ( 22.04 ) .",
    "the difference between these averages @xmath2 is statistically greater than zero . in this work",
    "_ significance level _ is always @xmath3 .",
    "bootstrapping 10000 times we get @xmath4 is normally distributed as @xmath5 .    observing the _ loess _ smooth fit in fig.[fig : loess ]",
    "we set the following hypothesis up . in the first half of the game the scoring rate is constant , in the second it grows linearly with time .",
    "we also notice that the first minutes could have an inferior scoring rate respect to the other minutes in the first half .",
    "that is reasonable , the game starts always in the middle of the field , far from a comfortable scoring position .    on the first half ,",
    "our probabilistic model is that goals are distributed according to a @xmath6 where @xmath7 for all @xmath8 in @xmath9 . performing a @xmath10 _ goodness of fit _",
    "test we get @xmath11 , homogeneity would be rejected .",
    "but , if we remove just minute 18th , we get @xmath12 and homogeneity would be far from rejected .",
    "we do nt want to be too much lighthearted in dropping observations to satisfy our model so we reshape the dataset and repeat the test . instead of considering a match",
    "as composed of a sequence of single minutes , we consider it as a sequence of 2 , 3 and 5 minutes blocks .",
    "for each minutes block we set the associate number of goals as the average number goals scored in each minute making the block .",
    "performing again the @xmath10 _ goodness of fit _",
    "test on the _ first half _",
    ", now seen as sequence of 2,3,5 minutes blocks , we get _ pvalue _ respectively @xmath13 . with a minimal smoothing reshape",
    "we see homogeneity test in far from rejected , without dropping any observation . in conclusion , we are confident that the _ first half _",
    "can be considered homogeneous and minute 18th an outlier .    in the _ second half _",
    "our working hypothesis is a linear relation between minutes elapsed and goals scored .",
    "we begin fitting a simple linear regression model with _ minute _ as independent variable . by the _",
    "t - test _ , _ minute _ is a significant variable , @xmath14 .",
    "residuals can be considered normally distributed according to _ kolmogorov - smirnov _ and _ shaipiro - wilk _ normality test , which give respectively _ pvalues _ @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is little and not much interesting for us .",
    "the fitted model appears in eq.[eq : model-1 ] @xmath17    from eq.[eq : model-1 ] we can get the expected number of goals in minute @xmath18 .",
    "we will call these values @xmath19 .",
    "normalizing @xmath20 we get @xmath21 .",
    "and now we can apply again the @xmath10 to see if the model for the _ second half _ is appropriate .",
    "our null hypothesis is that goals realized in the second half ( @xmath22 ) are multinomially distributed with probability vector @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath10 test returns a pvalue of @xmath24 so the null hypothesis can not be rejected in the second half game .",
    "let us join the half time models and check hypotheses against the full length match data . according to our models , the expected goal sequence is @xmath25 .",
    "where @xmath26 for @xmath27 $ ] is the average number of goals scored in the first half and @xmath26 for @xmath28 $ ] is set by eq.[eq : model-1 ] .",
    "normalizing @xmath29 we get a probabilities vector @xmath30 , a graphical representation of it appears in fig.[fig : model - scoring ] . using again a @xmath10 , we test if goals scored in all word cups matches minute per minute can be a realization of a _ multinomial distribution _ with probabilities vector @xmath30 . we get a @xmath31 . removing observation 18th",
    "we get @xmath32 and we can not reject .",
    "removing also the first three minutes improves the fit giving @xmath33 . to avoid removing observation",
    "we reshape the dataset in blocks of 2,3,5 minutes as done previously .",
    "the resulting _ pvalues _ are respectively @xmath34 so , the null hypothesis is never rejected .",
    "fig.[fig : model - per - blocks ] illustrates goals smoothing on reshaping minute variable .",
    "an analytic description of the probability distribution can be easily obtained once we move to a time continuous description . rescaling the match to a @xmath35 $ ] duration interval ,",
    "if there will be a goal , the probability it will happen before time @xmath36 will be given by @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is defined in eq.[eq : cdf ] .",
    "@xmath39    minutes 18th and 75th were called in the original document `` fertile '' minutes . using our model we have a different interpretation for each one of them . in fig.[fig : simulated - max ] we see the simulated distribution of the maximum in the first and second half according to the model . for the first half we see that an observation larger than the 18th ( 42 goals ) is improbable , its probability is approximately 0.0015 . on the contrary , one observation larger than the 75th ( 44 goals ) in the second half it is not improbable at all ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "there is enough evidence to state that the goal scoring distribution in the world cup matches can be considered constant in the first half game and growing linearly in the second half . dividing the game in blocks of 2 , 3 or 5 minutes confirms the model is valid and makes is more robust to extreme values .",
    "an analytic cumulative distribution function for goal scoring is presented in eq.[eq : cdf ] .",
    "previous finding in article @xcite are confirmed , there are more goals in the second half respect to the first one . according to our model , if there is a goal in a match , the probability that it will be in the first half is @xmath41 .",
    "the last part of the game is most probable for a goal , and there is a trend toward more goals as time passes , but only in the second half .",
    "_ the economist _ conclusions about its dataset are only partially acceptable .",
    "indeed , it is true that in on the last part of the game there are expected more goals .",
    "it is not true that minute 75th is an especially `` fertile '' minute , a maximum of 44 goals can be easily realized by the variability of the second half game .",
    "minute 18th is more interesting , according to our model the probability of observing a maximum of 42 goals in the first half is about @xmath42 .",
    "we guess it has to be considered an outlier and removed because it is an isolated burst , it has no connections with its neighboring values . performing a mild smooth , as grouping each match as a sequence of 2 minutes removes all of its importance .",
