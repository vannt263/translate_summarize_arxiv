    "the fact that neutrinos are massive particles has been accepted since the discovery of neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "experiments investigating neutrino oscillations with solar neutrinos , reactor neutrinos , atmospheric neutrinos and neutrinos produced at accelerator facilities have been able to precisely define the three mixing angles @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the difference in the squared mass eigenvalues @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "while future improved neutrino oscillation experiments will provide information about the hierarchy of the mass eigenvalues , they will not be able to set the mass energy scale .",
    "the determination of the neutrino mass energy scale is a complicated task due to the weak interaction of neutrinos and to the smallness of their mass .",
    "there exist several approaches which can potentially yield this result : the analysis of the visible structures in the universe @xcite , the existence of neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite , the measurement of the time of flight of neutrinos emitted in supernova explosions @xcite and the analysis of the kinematics of low energy beta decays and electron capture ( ec ) processes @xcite . presently the most stringent limit , @xmath0ev , was achieved for the electron anti - neutrino mass @xcite by the analysis of the endpoint region of the @xmath9h beta spectrum .",
    "the electron capture @xmath1ho experiment , echo , has the aim to investigate the electron neutrino mass in the energy range below 1 ev by a high precision and high statistics calorimetric measurement of the @xmath1ho electron capture spectrum @xcite , @xcite . among all the nuclides undergoing electron capture processes",
    ", @xmath1ho has the lowest energy available to the decay @xmath10kev , which is given by the difference in the mass of mother and daughter .",
    "this is the reason why presently @xmath1ho is the best candidate to perform experiments investigating the value of the electron neutrino mass . on the other hand",
    "the very low @xmath2 implies that detectors showing high energy resolution in the energy range below @xmath11kev need to be used .",
    "presently the detectors that can measure energies below 3 kev with the highest precision are low temperature micro - calorimeters @xcite . within the echo experiment , low temperature metallic magnetic calorimeters ( mmcs ) will be used . in order to reach the aimed sensitivity on the electron neutrino mass ,",
    "a number of experimental techniques and investigations have to be brought together , not only the development high energy resolution and fast detectors : @xmath1ho source production and purification , precise theoretical and experimental parameterization of the calorimetric ec spectrum including in particular the value of @xmath2 which should be precisely measured independently . in the following a short discussion on the present investigations within the echo experiment",
    "will be reported .",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath12ev .",
    "b ) a rise time of @xmath13ns is extracted by the exponential fit.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in a recent paper by galeazzi et al .",
    "@xcite , several scenarios to reach the sub - ev sensitivity have been described .",
    "a total statistics of @xmath14 counts in the full spectrum needs to be acquired , that leads to a required @xmath1ho activity of more than @xmath15 bq , and the detectors should meet the following requirements :    * fast signal rise - time , in order to reduce the un - resolved pile - up background due to the impossibility to de - convolve two or more events which happen in the same detector within a time interval shorter than the signal rise - time * energy resolution better than @xmath16ev to have the right accuracy in the end point description * possibility of multiplexing arrays of detectors without degrading the performance of the single pixel . *",
    "good linearity in order to precisely define the energy scale of the @xmath1ho ec spectrum and in particular fix the endpoint .",
    "the echo experiment will be performed using metallic magnetic calorimeters ( mmcs ) @xcite .",
    "mmcs are energy dispersive detectors typically operated at temperatures below @xmath17mk .",
    "these detectors consist of a particle absorber , where the energy is deposited , tightly connected to a temperature sensor which is weakly connected to a thermal bath .",
    "the deposition of energy in the absorber leads to an increase of the detector temperature .",
    "the temperature sensor of the mmcs is a paramagnetic alloy which resides in a small magnetic field .",
    "the change of temperature leads to a change of magnetization of the sensor which is read - out as a change of flux by a low - noise squid magnetometer .",
    "the sensor material , presently used for mmcs , is a dilute alloy of erbium in gold , au : er . the concentration of erbium ions in the sensor can be chosen to optimize the detector performance and usually varies between 200 ppm and 800 ppm .",
    "the spectral resolving power of a state of the art mmcs for soft x - rays is above 3000 . for completely micro - structured detectors , an energy resolution of @xmath18ev at @xmath19kev and a signal rise - time @xmath20ns @xcite",
    "have been achieved .",
    "moreover the typical non - linearity at 6 kev is less than @xmath21 and the non - linear part can be described very well by a polynomial function of second order .",
    "the achieved performance suggests that mmcs are suitable detectors for measuring the high precision and high statistics ec spectrum of @xmath1ho . in order to perform a calorimetric measurement of the @xmath1ho ec spectrum",
    ", the @xmath1ho source has to be :    * part of the sensitive volume of detector to prevent the partial loss of energy * homogeneously distributed so that the detector response is position independent * completely contained in the detector in order to ensure a quantum efficiency for the emitted particles of @xmath22 .",
    "the optimum activity per pixel will be a compromise between having a high count rate per pixel and reduce the un - resolved pile - up as well as the heat capacity of the detector . within our presently favored scenario",
    "the maximum activity per pixel can vary between 10 bq and 100 bq .",
    "the relatively low activity per pixel leads to a relatively large number of pixels to host the required activity of @xmath15 bq .",
    "this requires the development of a multiplexed detector readout .",
    "the read - out scheme for mmcs is compatible with several multiplexing techniques developed for low temperature micro - calorimeters , in particular with the microwave multiplexing which has the positive aspect to keep the performance of each detector in the array very close to that of a single pixel readout .",
    "a first prototype detector chip consisting of four pixels having a gold absorber with implanted @xmath1ho has already been produced and tested @xcite .",
    "the ion implantation process was performed at isolde - cern @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1ho ions have been implanted over a reduced area @xmath23m@xmath24 of the first gold layer of the absorber having dimensions @xmath25m@xmath9 . a second gold layer having as well dimensions of @xmath25m@xmath9 was deposited on top of the first layer . with this absorber fabrication ,",
    "all the three mentioned requirements for embedding the source have been fulfilled @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1ho activity per pixel was about @xmath26 bq .",
    "the first measurements performed using only one pixel of the prototype chip showed that the implantation process did not degrade the performance of the mmc .",
    "an energy resolution of @xmath27ev and the rise - time @xmath13ns have been measured and the non - linearity at 6 kev was less than @xmath21 , as expected @xcite .",
    "a second experiment had been performed with the same chip .",
    "two pixels have been simultaneously measured for about two months .",
    "on one of them a @xmath28fe calibration source was collimated .",
    "[ performance ] shows the performance achieved in this experiment .",
    "an energy resolution of @xmath12ev was achieved and the signal rise - time was @xmath13ns , as expected .",
    "[ spectrum ] shows the spectrum obtained combining more than 30 files for each of the two pixels .",
    "the results achieved using the mmc prototypes have shown that the requirements for the single pixel performance have been met .",
    "the echo collaboration aims at further improving the energy resolution of the mmc having @xmath1ho ions contained in the absorber and reach an energy resolution below @xmath29ev for multiplexed detectors",
    ".    ho ec spectrum ]",
    "presently new chips consisting of 64 pixels which are read - out using the microwave multiplexing scheme @xcite have been developed . in this multiplexing scheme",
    "every detector is coupled to a non - hysteretic , un - shunted rf - squid which is coupled to a superconducting microwave resonator with high internal quality factor and unique resonance frequency . a change of magnetic flux inside the squid caused by an event in the detector leads to a change of the effective squid inductance and therefore , due to the mutual interaction , to a change of the resonance frequency of the corresponding microwave resonator .",
    "it is possible to measure the signal of each detector simultaneously by capacitively coupling the corresponding number of resonators to a common transmission line , injecting a microwave frequency comb driving each resonator at resonance and monitoring either amplitude or phase of each frequency component of the transmitted signal .",
    "[ mux_chip ] shows the design of the 64-pixels chip and the micro - fabricated chip . a detailed description of single pixel geometry , resonator design and rf - squid properties as well as the expected performance of the detectors in the array is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the production of a sufficient amount of @xmath1ho atoms in a radiochemically pure form is of paramount importance for the success of the echo experiment .",
    "preliminary studies of different approaches to produce @xmath1ho have already been performed by the echo collaboration and by others @xcite .",
    "the production methods for @xmath1ho can mainly be divided into two branches :    * charged particle activation of suitable targets in reactions that lead to @xmath1ho or its precursor @xmath1er which decays to @xmath1ho ( ec and @xmath30 decay ) with a half - life @xmath31min * thermal neutron activation of enriched @xmath32er targets .",
    "the reaction that is typically used for the direct activation with proton beams is @xmath33dy@xmath34ho .",
    "another possible direct reaction uses deuteron projectiles , @xmath1dy@xmath35ho.examples for indirect @xmath1ho production are @xmath33dy@xmath36er(ec , @xmath30)@xmath1ho and @xmath37tb@xmath38li@xmath39er(ec , @xmath30)@xmath1ho . in the echo experiment",
    "all the described methods for production of @xmath1ho through charged particle activation processes as well as with neutron irradiation of a @xmath32er target are being considered , as well as possible new methods . typically , in the production of @xmath1ho , contaminants nuclides with decay properties that interfere with the desired clean @xmath1ho ec spectrum are produced .",
    "these include long - lived @xmath40-decaying nuclides like @xmath41ho .",
    "thus , a careful separation of @xmath1ho is of paramount importance and will be performed by a combination of chemical and potentially physical separations before as well as after the irradiation of the sample . in this way , samples will be produced that contain contaminants on a level at which their contribution to the background of the calorimetric measurement is smaller then the intrinsic pile - up background .",
    "tests both at accelerator as well as at reactor facilities are already under way . the aim of these tests is to investigate and quantify the production of radioactive contaminants and to improve the purification methods in order to reach the required purity . as a final step , the production of samples suitable for the calorimetric measurements will be optimized .",
    "a method that appears attractive include the formation of intermetallic samples @xcite or ion - implantation .",
    "in an electron capture process a nucleus @xmath42x decays by capturing an electron from the inner atomic shells and emitting an electron neutrino to @xmath43x .",
    "the daughter atom is left in an excited state .",
    "the atomic de - excitation is a complex process which includes cascades of both x - rays and electron emissions ( auger electrons and coster - kronig transitions ) .",
    "the possibility to measure all the energy released in the decay minus the energy taken away by the neutrino simplifies the description of the spectrum .",
    "the expected shape of the calorimetrically measured ec spectrum is : @xmath44 and shows breit - wigner resonances centered at about the binding energy of the electron that was captured referred to the daughter atom nuclear potential , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 indicates the level from which the electron has been captured , with an intrinsic width @xmath47 .",
    "the intensities of these lines are given by the nuclear shape factors @xmath48 , the fraction of occupancy of the @xmath46-atomic shell @xmath49 , the squared wave - function of the captured electron calculated at the nucleus @xmath50 and a small correction , @xmath51 , due to electron exchange and overlap .",
    "the breit - wigner resonances are then modulated by the phase space factor which depends on the square of the electron neutrino mass @xmath52 and the energy available to the decay @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath53 is a constant .",
    "the purpose of the echo experiment is to improve the theoretical description of the ec spectrum of @xmath1ho , in particular by investigating the modification due to the environment .",
    "this will be done by applying the complete screening approximation of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite,@xcite to calculate the energy level of electrons and by improving the calculation of the partial decay rates by considering the finite size of the nucleus .",
    "this can be done by calculating the corresponding nuclear matrix elements for the transition @xmath54 and capture of @xmath55 and @xmath56 electrons using the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) approach @xcite .",
    "the total energy available for the decay of @xmath1ho to @xmath1dy is a fundamental parameter to reach the sub - ev sensitivity to the electron neutrino mass by the analysis of the high energy part of the @xmath1ho ec spectrum .",
    "the recommended value is @xmath57kev as can be found in @xcite , but other measurements give values that range from about 2.3 kev @xcite to about 2.8 kev obtained by two calorimetric measurements performed using low temperature detectors @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the aim of the echo collaboration is to reach a precision on the @xmath2 of 1 ev or better .",
    "after preliminary measurements at the double - penning trap mass spectrometers shiptrap @xcite and triga - trap @xcite , the final high accuracy measurement will be accomplished by the novel penning - trap mass spectrometer pentatrap @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness and complexity of this penning - trap mass spectrometer is associated with the unprecedented relative accuracy of a few parts in @xmath58 with which the @xmath2 must be measured .",
    "the echo experiment has the aim to investigate the electron neutrino mass in the sub - ev range .",
    "the performance achieved by the first prototype of mmcs with @xmath1ho implanted in the gold absorber demonstrated that mmcs fulfill all requirements on the single pixel level .",
    "we presented the different aspects that are presently under investigation within the echo project .",
    "the next goal of the echo collaboration is to set a small scale experiment based on arrays of mmcs with embedded @xmath1ho ions , for a total pixel number of about 100 , read out by the microwave multiplexing scheme . within this experiment about @xmath59 events",
    "will be collected .",
    "the analysis of the end part of the spectrum combined with the precise knowledge of the parameters describing the spectrum will allow to reach the sensitivity of few ev on the electron neutrino mass .",
    "a full scale experiment holds the prospect of reaching the sub - ev sensitivity .",
