    "information theory was originally developed by hartley  @xcite , nyquist  @xcite , and shannon  @xcite in order to establish a mathematical description of telecommunications and to understand how information may be lost upon transmission over noisy channels .",
    "shannon , in particular , developed a complete formalism in which the concept of information is quantified and important theorems regarding its transmission are proven .",
    "the fundamental quantity that measures information is _",
    "information entropy_. shannon has shown that the information entropy is the most suitable function of the probabilities for emission of signals by an ergodic source that measures the magnitude of the receiver s uncertainty on those signals . in this sense information entropy",
    "is a true measure of one s ignorance of their correct content .",
    "the larger the entropy the greater the uncertainty and , consequently , the information content .",
    "therefore , maximizing the information entropy can lead to evaluation of the signal probability distribution under the constraints imposed by the telecommunications problem at hand .",
    "application of this theory in physics could be versatile .",
    "all quantum phenomena , for example , are stochastic in nature and are described in terms of probability amplitudes .",
    "then by appropriately defining the information entropy of the physical system under consideration and maximizing it under constraints imposed by theoretical assumptions or experimental data one can obtain the probability amplitudes that are most consistent with one s ignorance of the system .",
    "this method has been used by plastino  @xcite to evaluate wave functions for various physical systems .",
    "it is a very powerful technique since it does not rely on any specific modeling but only on what is actually known about the system to derive best estimates for what is unknown .    in this article",
    "we apply information theory to improve parton , specifically gluon , distributions in nuclei .",
    "these are suitable subjects to the method because they are probabilistic in character .",
    "the problem whose solution we wish to improve is that of quarkonium suppression in proton - nucleus collisions at very high energies . the production of charmonium states , most notably of the @xmath1 boson as well as of bottomonium ones , especially the @xmath0 resonances , has been observed in various experiments involving heavy nuclear targets to be lower that in hydrogen if the latter is multiplied by the mass number of the nucleus . at energies achieved at fermilab @xmath1 and @xmath0 suppression",
    "is very pronounced and exhibits a characteristic dependence on the momentum fraction of the target nucleon carried by the struck parton  @xcite .",
    "many models have been developed to explain this behavior .",
    "for the purposes of demonstrating the information theory method we consider a model that is based on the assumption that quarks in nuclei have a finite probability to conglomerate forming multi - quark color singlet states , usually called ( multi)quark clusters  @xcite .",
    "the parton distributions in such clusters differ from those in single nucleons and generally are concentrated to lower momentum fractions of the partons as the cluster becomes larger .",
    "this model supplemented by final state dissociation of the produced quarkonium has successfully described @xmath1 suppression in hadron - nucleus collisions as well as most heavy ion collisions , the latter being the topic of heated debate due to their relevance with quark - gluon plasma production . in this model",
    "very simple parton distributions have been used based on very general assumptions . however , the gluon distributions which play a crucial role in quarkonium production are poorly known in nuclei .",
    "it turns out that within this model the gluon distributions that solve the problem of @xmath1 suppression are inadequate to describe @xmath0 suppression from the same experiment .",
    "we shall use information theory to improve them in a manner that maintains their applicability to the @xmath1 data and , at the same time , to enhance agreement with the @xmath0 data .",
    "suppose an ergodic source of information , which can be anything from a telegraphic device to a quantum system , produces signals @xmath2 from some available ensemble @xmath3 with probability distribution @xmath4 .",
    "we define the information entropy of the source as  @xcite @xmath5 where the summation includes all instances of @xmath2 in @xmath3 and can indicate an integral if @xmath2 is a continuous variable and @xmath6 are a group of fixed parameters in the function @xmath7 .",
    "it is required that @xmath8 if the logarithm is binary then @xmath9 is expressed in bits . considered as",
    "a functional of the probability distribution , @xmath9 is maximal when @xmath7 is uniform ; we know the most about a system when the signals it produces have no variability . to obtain the optimal function @xmath10 , i.e. , to estimate the `` best '' set of parameters @xmath6 we impose the extremization condition @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "to ensure a maximum second order derivatives must be looked at as well . in this work",
    "we assume a certain functional form for @xmath7 and simply want to determine its parameters .",
    "the procedure can be generalized to include cases in which we do not know the exact form of @xmath7 but there are constraints based on data .",
    "the method of lagrange s multipliers can be used to evaluate distribution functions when a number of expectation values are known  @xcite .",
    "the observed suppression of the @xmath1 , @xmath13 production cross section per unit mass number , @xmath14 , in high energy hadron - nucleus  @xcite and nucleus - nucleus  @xcite collisions exhibits a strong nuclear dependence .",
    "the hadron - nucleus data also show that the depletion increases with the longitudinal momentum of the quarkonium .",
    "these results have generated many theoretical studies .",
    "a variety of effects are thought to contribute and numerous models have been suggested .",
    "these contributions may be grouped into six major categories : ( 1 ) quarkonium scattering off parton and/or hadron co - movers  @xcite ; ( 2 ) glauber inelastic scattering on the nucleons  @xcite ; ( 3 ) shadowing and emc distortions of the nuclear parton distributions  @xcite ; ( 4 ) parton scattering before  @xcite and after  @xcite the hard process ; ( 5 ) parton energy loss in the initial and/or the final state  @xcite and , ( 6 ) intrinsic charm in nucleons  @xcite .",
    "color transparency may alter the charmonium glauber absorption  @xcite . in the case of heavy ion collisions contribution of an unconfined state ( quark gluon plasma )",
    "has probably been very small in earlier experiments  @xcite but is currently debated due to new data  @xcite . in our view",
    "more than one contribution must be carefully balanced to explain the quarkonium suppression . here",
    "the modifications of the initial state parton distributions ( for all values of the bjorken variable , @xmath2 ) and the final state inelastic scattering ( absorption ) are considered .    in this article",
    "the term `` emc effect '' , named after the european muon collaboration , will signify any deviation from unity of the structure function ratio of a bound nucleon to that of a free one at any value of the variable @xmath2 , the latter defined as the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the interacting parton .",
    "the emc effect has been studied in the framework of the expansion of a nuclear state @xmath15 on a complete basis of color singlet states labeled by the number of ( 3 , 6 , 9 or more ) valence quarks they contain .",
    "such states , also referred to as multi - quark clusters , are formed when nucleons bound in a nucleus overlap sufficiently so that they share their constituent partons .",
    "the probabilities for multi - quark cluster formation can be estimated using nuclear wave functions  @xcite or can be found by fitting dis data  @xcite .",
    "the agreement with emc and nmc  @xcite data is excellent down to @xmath16 gev@xmath17 and the fit strongly constrains the quark momentum distributions in clusters .",
    "( momentum conservation in clusters fixes the _ total _ momentum fraction carried by the gluons . )",
    "good description of the small enhancement above unity of the emc ratio ( antishadowing ) around @xmath18 requires inclusion of up to 12q clusters but the essential features of the data are accommodated by a truncation to the 6q term and use of an _ effective _ 6q cluster probability , @xmath19 .",
    "the observed shadowing of the structure function , @xmath20 , in the nucleus for low @xmath21 and the depletion for intermediate @xmath2 combined with the qcd sum rules require the presence of antishadowing of @xmath20 for other values of @xmath2 .",
    "this antishadowing , however , need not be restricted to the range @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , this model predicts antishadowing for @xmath23 in agreement with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite on the slope of the ca over deuterium structure function ratio .",
    "in addition , the electron dis data from slac confirm the excellent agreement of this model with the observed nuclear dependence for all @xmath24  @xcite . the model has been successfully applied to explain nuclear effects in drell - yan processes  @xcite and",
    "gives interesting predictions for these effects at rhic energies  @xcite .",
    "direct photon production in hadron - nucleus collisions  @xcite has also been predicted to be altered by nuclear effects .",
    "the probability @xmath19 depends on @xmath14 approximately logarithmically and is 0.040 - 0.052 for deuterium  @xcite .",
    "very dense nuclei ( @xmath25he ) have @xmath19 values larger than the logarithmic prediction . in the scaling limit",
    "the nq proton - like cluster parton momentum distributions are assumed to have standard forms , @xmath26 the exponents that best describe the nmc data are ( @xmath27 ) = ( 3 , 9 , 10 , 11 ) .",
    "for the gluon exponents the direct @xmath28 data suggest ( @xmath29 ) = ( 6 , 10 )  @xcite .",
    "the valence exponents approximately follow the dimensional counting rules .",
    "the ocean consists of three species of quarks ( and their antiparticles ) with the strange distribution being half as large as the up ( or down ) quark sea distribution .",
    "the gluon momentum fraction is taken 5 times larger than the ocean one .",
    "isospin invariance relations connect the distributions that belong to the same isospin states reducing , thus , the number of independent paramenters .",
    "kinematics forces the fraction of the cluster momentum carried by a parton in 6q clusters , @xmath30 , to be half as large as that in nucleons , @xmath31 . in this model",

    "including 3q and 6q clusters in the nucleus the doubly differential hadron level cross section for quarkonium production is calculated from the @xmath32 order parton level ones ( with both quark annihilation ( @xmath33 ) and gluon fusion ( @xmath34 ) included ) .",
    "the latter are convoluted with the appropriate sums of products of parton distributions @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the indices 1 and 2 refer to the probe ( moving in the @xmath38 direction in the laboratory ) and the target , respectively .",
    "the duality ( in effect color evaporation ) hypothesis is applied to integrate the differential cross section over @xmath39 with @xmath40 ranging from twice the @xmath41 quark mass , @xmath42 , to the open charm ( bottom ) threshold , @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 gev and @xmath45 gev .",
    "the duality constant , @xmath46 , is simply the portion of the total charmonium cross section ( up to a given order ) that corresponds to the quarkonium ; it cancels in cross section ratios .",
    "the resulting cross section can be expressed as a function of the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the produced quark - antiquark pair , @xmath47 .",
    "the higher order corrections are assumed to result in a multiplicative factor , @xmath48 .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence due to higher order diagrams is , thus , integrated over and that due to the intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons is neglected .",
    "these considerations lead to the order @xmath32 equation @xmath49 ,   \\label{hadron}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the partonic - level cross sections for the two hard processes and @xmath52 are the jacobians that transform @xmath53 and @xmath54 to @xmath55 and @xmath39 . in this way",
    "the entire quarkonium yield is found .",
    "the various final states being unitary rearrangements of one another have up to this point the same dependence on emc - type nuclear effects at the same @xmath56 . the perturbative @xmath57 evolution of the parton distributions is omitted as it largely cancels in the calculation of cross section ratios .",
    "in addition , the @xmath57 values that are relevant to the production of quarkonium states are inside the scaling region in which the parton distributions used in this work are valid .      after its production the @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) system propagates in the nuclear medium developing into a quarkonium state which then decays into the observed lepton pairs . during this stage",
    "the system may be inelastically scattered by 3q and 6q clusters .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the scattering occurs with clusters bound in the nucleus since the break up time of the latter exceeds the time the pair needs to traverse the nuclear radius .",
    "the @xmath1 absorption cross section has been measured to be @xmath60 3.5 mbarn / nucleon  @xcite .",
    "this number has been extracted in a kinematic range in which parton distribution modifications are negligibly small ( @xmath61 , the point at which the emc ratio crosses the unit line ) and since it is the average absorption cross section over the path traversed in the nucleus , color transparency effects are already in it .",
    "the @xmath13 is attenuated a little more than the @xmath1 due to its larger radius . in this",
    "it is also assumed that the cross section for bottomonium ( @xmath0 states ) absorption is of the same order as that of charmonium but smaller ( @xmath62 mbarn / nucleon ) due to its more compact size .",
    "the cross section on a 6q cluster is @xmath63 times larger than that on a nucleon ( bag model estimate ) but the density of scattering centers in the medium is reduced when @xmath64",
    ". then @xmath65/(1+f),\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the number density of the nucleus @xmath14 taken as constant within the nuclear volume .",
    "the average path length the @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) pair travels in an approximately spherical nucleus of radius @xmath67 estimated by means of a simple geometrical ( not eikonal ) calculation is @xmath68 .",
    "the experimentally measured nuclear rms radii  @xcite are employed to compute @xmath66 and @xmath69 .",
    "the cross section in eq.([hadron ] ) is then attenuated by the factor @xmath70.\\ ] ]",
    "the nuclear dependence is extracted by taking the ratio , @xmath71 , of the @xmath1 production cross section per unit @xmath14 in collisions of a hadron , proton in this case , with a heavy nucleus to that in collisions with a light one and examining its @xmath55 dependence .",
    "since the @xmath48-factor may also depend on @xmath55 at first we examine the ratio of the experimental to the order @xmath32 theoretical cross section . in fig .  1 we present this ratio for cu and",
    "be using a representative set of parameters for our model and the data of ref .",
    "@xmath46 is the same in both cases and cancels in the ratio .",
    "clearly the @xmath48-factor exhibits a strong @xmath55 dependence but , most importantly for our purposes , is the same for the two nuclei .",
    "this implies that it will cancel in ratios of two theoretical or experimental cross sections .",
    "the origin of this factor must , thus , lie in processes that do not depend on the size and intrinsic properties of the nucleus ( the absorption part is included in the results of fig .  1 ) .",
    "the @xmath55 dependence of @xmath48 in fig .",
    "1 agrees with that of the ratio of the `` diffractive '' to hard cross sections in ref .",
    "issues related to the relative suppression of various charmonium states are outside the scope of this article .    the results for @xmath71 are confronted with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite in fig .  2 . the dotted lines in fig .  2",
    "represent the prediction of the full model including 6q clusters and final state absorption with the lowest ( highest ) value of @xmath19 for the heavy ( light ) nucleus and the largest values of the 6q ocean and gluon exponents , ( @xmath72 ) = ( 12 , 11 ) ; the solid ones correspond to the opposite @xmath19 combination and ( @xmath72 ) = ( 10 , 9 ) . in order to make the influence of the initial and final state contributions to @xmath71 clear in fig .",
    "2(d ) the results without final state absorption are shown ( short and long dash curves with the same connotation as the dotted and solid ones , respectively ) as well as the result with only final state absorption , @xmath73 ( dot - dash line ) .",
    "it is evident that the predictions of the full model are in agreement with the data .",
    "we note in passing that for large negative @xmath55 this model predicts antishadowing of @xmath1 production in p - a collisions because in this region large @xmath74 values for the gluon distribution ratio are accessed .",
    "using the model we described earlier we can also calculate the suppression ratio for the @xmath0 states and compare the results with the data of ref .",
    "specifically we calculate the exponent @xmath75 defined by means of the equation @xmath76 where the superscripts refer to large nuclei ( @xmath14 ) or deuterium ( @xmath77 ) targets and @xmath78 . at this point",
    "it is instructive to observe that gluon fusion dominates the charmonium production process and is very important for bottomonium production as well .",
    "therefore , the ratio of cross sections to a large extent reflects the ratio of gluon distributions , @xmath79 .",
    "it is not hard to see that with the given definition of gluon distributions @xmath79 monotonically increases with @xmath74 . as shown in fig .  3 , however , the data of ref .",
    "@xcite contradict this theoretical prediction . at @xmath80",
    "there is a wide `` bump '' and the ratio starts decreasing at higher @xmath74 .",
    "the reason that this behavior becomes more apparent in the case of @xmath0 production is the fact that the @xmath0 is much more massive than the @xmath1 . for given center of mass energy ,",
    "a particular quarkonium momentum , @xmath55 , probes a larger @xmath74 value in the @xmath0 case .",
    "the gluon distributions being the most relevant and the least known among all the partons should be the first candidates for improvement .      at this point",
    "we turn to information theory .",
    "the total momentum fractions carried by the partons in an nq cluster , @xmath81 where @xmath82 designates the type of parton and @xmath83 is the momentum distribution of @xmath82 , must always add up to unity .",
    "consequently the functions @xmath83 satisfy the condition required in order to define an information entropy for them , @xmath84    we shall maintain the quark distributions as defined in the previous section and modify the gluon distributions under the constraint that the total momentum fraction carried by gluons in each type of cluster is fixed and equal to that of the unmodified distributions , i.e. , @xmath85 for nucleons and @xmath86 for 6q clusters .",
    "the trend of the @xmath0 data suggests that the simplest possible modification to the gluon distributions is an alteration of the linear term in @xmath2 .",
    "we will , then , define corrected momentum distributions for the gluons in nucleons and 6q clusters as @xmath87 for each @xmath88 we now have two unknown parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "momentum conservation , i.e. , that the fractions @xmath91 are constant , imposes the condition @xmath92 where the exponents @xmath93 are kept fixed , @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    ". then we evaluate @xmath89 from the requirement @xmath96    the maximization procedure yields the following numbers : @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we can compare these numbers with the uncorrected ones : @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we have thus changed the shape of the function without affecting its integral , the total gluon momentum .",
    "the behavior of the new functions differs from that of the old ones mostly in the large @xmath2 region for which on the other hand we have little experimental data .",
    "we note that the ocean distributions could not accommodate such type of alteration because deeply inelastic scattering imposes a constraint on the ratio of neutron to proton structure functions , @xmath101 as @xmath102 .    using the corrected distributions we can recalculate the exponent @xmath75 and compare the results with the data . with a final state absorption cross section of 3 mbarn / nucleon and the new distributions the agreement with the data",
    "is considerably improved as shown in fig .  3 in which the upper curve corresponds to the uncorrected model , the lower curve to the corrected model using only gluon fusion contributions and the middle curve to the corrected model including gluon fusion and quark annihilation .",
    "it must be pointed out that this is not the only model that gives reasonable description of the relative @xmath1 to @xmath0 suppression data in p - a collisions .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite attribute the smaller suppression of @xmath0 to the @xmath103 evolution of the distribution functions , where @xmath40 is the mass of the resonance .",
    "indeed , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the evolution of the ocean ( and consequently the gluon ) distributions leads to smaller shadowing as @xmath57 decreases .",
    "our model neglects the @xmath57 evolution relying on the observation  @xcite that the masses of the quarkonium resonances are already in the scaling region and attributes the reduced @xmath0 suppression to its smaller absorption cross section .",
    "it is conceivable that both effects may , in fact , contribute to this phenomenon .",
    "we would mostly like to emphasize that it is the shape of the suppression curve that needed to be improved to account for the @xmath0 data .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that due to the fact that @xmath0 production probes a different kinematic regime from @xmath104 the correction on the gluon distributions has only a small effect on the @xmath1 suppression curves .",
    "the agreement with the charmonium data is still good as it can be observed in fig .  4 , although it slightly deteriorates at small @xmath55 ( large @xmath74 ) .",
    "in addition the corrected model does not exhibit antishadowing of @xmath1 production for negative @xmath55 a feature that would be in contradiction with the data  @xcite .",
    "data on bottomonium and charmonium give complementary information on the gluon distributions in nuclei .",
    "in addition the @xmath0 is a really good probe of the initial state in which it is produced due to low absorption cross section .",
    "we can use this model to make predictions for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 suppression at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) with @xmath105 gev / nucleon .",
    "the calculation proceeds along the same lines as for p - a collisions but now there is the additional possibility of 6q-6q cluster collisions .",
    "the nuclear effect is , thus , more pronounced .",
    "the cross section for collisions of a nucleus a with a nucleus b is  @xcite @xmath106,\\ ] ] where @xmath107 $ ] , @xmath12 and @xmath108 represent the type of colliding cluster , @xmath56 is the nucleon - nucleon cm energy and @xmath109 are functions of parton distributions appropriate for a - b collisions .    in fig .  5 we show theoretical results obtained with the uncorrected ( curves marked by ( d ) )  @xcite and the corrected ( curves marked by ( c ) ) models .",
    "the curves exhibiting less suppression are for the @xmath0 .",
    "the corrected model leads to larger suppression .",
    "the large @xmath55 behavior is now much more distinct .",
    "it can be understood if we realize that in symmetric heavy ion collisions as @xmath110 the large @xmath2 region for the positively moving nucleus is probed .",
    "therefore , in the uncorrected model the ratio increases with @xmath55 reflecting the increase in the gluon distribution ratio and exhibits antishadowing while in the corrected one it flattens out and remains below unity .",
    "we have applied information theory to improve the gluon momentum distribution functions in nuclei , including the `` emc effect '' .",
    "the main idea is that by defining an information entropy , @xmath9 , for those functions whose total integral is unity we can evaluate their parameters by maximizing @xmath9 with respect to them . in other words",
    "we assume that the best choice of parameters is the one that is consistent with maximal ignorance under the constraint of momentum conservation . a quark - cluster model for",
    "the `` emc effect '' has been used to establish good agreement with the data on @xmath1 suppression in p - a collisions but proved inadequate to describe @xmath0 suppression .",
    "then information theory provided us with a tool to improve the model with significant success .",
    "the gluon distributions have been corrected for their behavior at large @xmath2 and an overall agreement with the differential cross sections for quarkonium suppression was achieved .",
    "an interesting aspect of this method is that it does not rely on any specific microscopic theory which in turn should be investigated in detail but uses only very general notions .",
    "the solution that is consistent with the assumption of maximal ignorance , quantified by the information entropy , seems to be an optimal one .",
    "this method can be used to improve the parameters of more detailed and realistic parton distributions in nucleons and nuclei under constraints imposed by experimental data .",
