    "we have studied in @xcite some properties of @xmath15 where we emphasize the variation of @xmath0 . for particular cases of @xmath0 one can find formulas for the mahler measure over @xmath0 . in the following formulas , @xmath5 .    * if @xmath16 , @xmath17 where the term on the right hand - side indicates the mahler measure in the classical sense , @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the @xmath20-th unit torus . *",
    "if @xmath0 is finite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the adjacency matrix of a weighted cayley graph of @xmath0 generated by the monomials of @xmath6 ( see @xcite ) and we are considering the main branch of the logarithm .",
    "this formula provides a meromorphic continuation of the mahler measure @xmath23 to the complex plane minus @xmath24 . *",
    "if @xmath25 , then @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes an @xmath28-th primitive root of the unity , and again , we are considering the main branch of the logarithm .    of further interest",
    "are approximation results for the mahler measure over infinite groups . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that    * @xmath29 * @xmath30 + here @xmath31 is the dihedral group @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "following the ideas in @xcite , notice that if @xmath34 , then @xmath35 for each value of @xmath4 , @xmath36 is a period of @xmath37 in @xmath38 .",
    "the integral depends on the homology class of @xmath39 in @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the zero locus of the denominator in the rational function ( which is generically non - singular as @xmath4 varies ) .",
    "see griffiths @xcite .",
    "now if we take successive derivatives of @xmath37 , we obtain several differential forms that belong to a subspace of the de rham cohomology @xmath42 which has finite dimension .",
    "griffiths proves that @xmath36 satisfies a picard - fuchs differential equation @xmath43 where the @xmath44 are polynomials in @xmath4 , see @xcite for details .",
    "from such a differential equation it is easy to deduce a linear recurrence with polynomial coefficients for the coefficients @xmath9_0 $ ] of @xmath36 .",
    "one can extend this more generally :    if @xmath0 is a finitely generated abelian group then the coefficients @xmath45_0 $ ] satisfy a linear recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients .    * proof .",
    "* let @xmath46 . combining equation ( [ finite : eq ] ) and the techniques that are used in the proof of equation ( [ lim ] ) ( see @xcite ) , we obtain that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a primitive root of unity , and the sum on the right involves mahler measures in the classical ( abelian ) sense .",
    "then the result follows easily since it is known for mahler measures .    for finite groups , we have the following",
    "if @xmath0 is a finite group , then the coefficients @xmath45_0 $ ] satisfy a recurrence relation ( with constant coefficients ) of length at most @xmath49 .",
    "* in the proof of equation ( [ finite : eq ] ) ( theorem 6 in @xcite ) we write @xmath50 any polynomial that annihilates @xmath22 yields a recurrence relation with constant coefficients for @xmath11 . in particular , the characteristic polynomial yields a bound for the length of the recurrence .",
    "more is known in the case where @xmath0 is free @xcite : the function @xmath36 turns out to be algebraic .",
    "a proof for this uses algebraic functions in non - commuting variables and a theorem of haiman @xcite ; see @xcite for details .",
    "a natural question is the following : can we say anything for `` intermediate '' groups ?",
    "of particular interest is the case when @xmath51 where @xmath1 are the generators in a given group presentation of the group @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath52_0 $ ] has the following interpretation    [ circuits ] the number of closed circuits based at the origin in the cayley graph of @xmath0 - with respect to the generators @xmath1 in the presentation - is given by @xmath52_0 $ ] .",
    "consider the example of @xmath53 with group @xmath54 .",
    "then one obtains ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath55    since we only have terms with even degree , we reparametrize , @xmath56 then the differential equation is given by @xcite @xmath57    from such a differential equation it is possible to deduce a recurrence of the coefficients , in this case , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 of course this equation can be easily deduced from the formula for @xmath11 .",
    "if one considers one more variable , @xmath60 .",
    "then one obtains @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63    as observed in @xcite , for @xmath64 variables , we obtain @xmath65 by lemma [ circuits ] these coefficients can be interpreted as the number of circuits of length @xmath66 ( that start and end at the origin ) in the @xmath64-dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "another polynomial that is interesting to study is @xmath67 one has @xcite that @xmath68 we see that the terms in equation ( [ p1 ] ) correspond to the one in ( [ p2 ] ) multiplied by @xmath69 , and that allows an easy translation for the recurrences .",
    "if @xmath70 then @xmath71    as an example , for @xmath72 we have @xmath73    one obtains @xmath74 , @xmath75 from equations ( [ rec : p_l ] ) and ( [ recurrsive_relation ] ) .",
    "furthermore , from the above discussion a closed form is given by ( see also @xcite ) @xmath76 and with the notations of this section : @xmath77_0=\\binom{2n}{n } a_n = \\binom{2n}{n } [ q_3^n]_0.\\ ] ]    also note that @xmath78_0=[(q_3 - 3)^n]_0 $ ] is related to @xmath11 by @xmath79    one can show that @xmath80 satisfies the recursion : @xmath81 , @xmath82    the numbers @xmath11 and @xmath80 have an interesting interpretation . since @xmath83 the constant coefficient @xmath80 in @xmath84 counts the number of closed circuits of length @xmath10 , based at a fixed point , in the triangular lattice that is depicted in figure [ triangular_lattice ] .    .",
    "]    a look at the honeycomb lattice in figure [ honeycomb ] reveals that at any point there are nine different paths of length two originating from that point .",
    "three are closed paths the other six can be labeled by @xmath85 and @xmath86 as in the triangular lattice ( figure [ triangular_lattice ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath11 is the number of closed circuits in the honeycomb lattice of length @xmath87 that are based at a fixed point .",
    "our motivation for studying the above examples comes from the fact that @xmath88 and @xmath89    here , @xmath90 is the hyperbolic volume of the figure-8 knot complement .",
    "the first equality was computed by smyth @xcite and the last one was observed by boyd @xcite .",
    "it follows that for @xmath4 sufficiently small we have : @xmath91 where @xmath92_0 $ ] and @xmath93_0 $ ] .",
    "this type of expression for the volume of the figure-8 knot should be compared to lck s formula @xcite ( theorem 3 ) . in that formula ,",
    "the volume of a knot complement is expressed in terms of a similar formula , but the mahler measure is computed over an element in the group ring of the fundamental group of the knot which is non - abelian .",
    "the coefficients in lck s formula are notably hard to compute in practice .      recall that we saw that the circuits in the triangular lattice and the even ones in the honeycomb lattice are related by @xmath94 more generally , in the previous example , we have that @xmath95 given a recurrence relation for the @xmath96 we would like to obtain a recurrence relation for the @xmath97 .",
    "the first observation is that we can assume that @xmath98 , since it is easy to find a recurrence relation for @xmath99 from the one for @xmath96 . in other words",
    ", we can assume @xmath100 consider one more time the generating function @xmath101 for the @xmath102 we have @xmath103 if @xmath104 is small enough , we can invert the order in the sum , @xmath105 now observe that @xmath106 putting everything together , @xmath107 now , a recurrence relation for @xmath11 is equivalent to a differential equation for @xmath108 , which translates into a differential equation for @xmath109 and from there one obtains a recurrence for @xmath102 .    as an example let us compute the recurrence in the case of @xmath102 with @xmath110 .",
    "first , we set @xmath111 .",
    "we have @xmath112 therefore , @xmath113 and @xmath114 let @xmath115 set @xmath116 , then @xmath117    notice that recurrence ( [ dif ] ) translates into the differential equation @xmath118    hence , @xmath119    we have @xmath120    @xmath121    replacing in @xmath122 we obtain @xmath123 @xmath124",
    "thus @xmath125 @xmath126    finally , the differential equation translates into the recurrence @xmath127 with initial terms @xmath128 .      if we reconsider the cases of @xmath129 and @xmath130 in the context of free variables , we have observed in @xcite that @xmath131 ( respectively @xmath132 ) counts the number of circuits of length @xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath66 ) in a @xmath133 ( resp .",
    "@xmath64)-regular trees respectively .",
    "the generating function for circuits in a @xmath134-regular tree was computed by bartholdi @xcite , @xmath135    for example , for @xmath136 , one gets @xmath137 if we let @xmath138 with @xmath139 , then , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143    for the case of @xmath144 , we have @xmath145 in particular , @xmath146 and @xmath141 , @xmath147 , @xmath148      let us consider again the polynomial @xmath149 but this time with respect to the group @xmath150    the @xmath151 correspond to counting circuits of length @xmath66 in the diamond lattice ( figure [ fig : diamonds ] ) .",
    "the vertices in this lattice can be divided into two different groups according to how the edges are oriented around the vertex .",
    "we indicate these two groups by rounded vertices and by a square vertices in the picture .",
    "the models in the left show how to interpret a random walk that is leaving a vertex ( rounded or square ) .",
    "notice that the edges can be divided into four families according to their direction .",
    "the minimum cycles in the lattice are given by hexagons and they correspond to the minimal relations in the group . typically , a hexagon is formed by three pairs of parallel edges .",
    "hence , there are four kinds of hexagons , according to which pair of parallel edges we choose to exclude . now",
    "a simple inspection of the four cases of hexagons reveals that they all stand for either the relation @xmath152 or @xmath153 and those are the two generating relations .",
    "the counting of the circuits in the diamond lattice appears in domb @xcite .",
    "however , it is stated that the @xmath11 are the constant coefficients of powers of the polynomial @xmath154 with respect to the base group @xmath155 . to see that both polynomials yield the same constant coefficients ,",
    "one considers @xmath156 @xmath157 in @xmath0 , even powers of @xmath158 and even powers of @xmath159 commute with each other and with the monomials @xmath160 and @xmath161 , where each exponent is @xmath162 or @xmath163 .",
    "also @xmath164 because of the parity of the exponents .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath165 @xmath166 now we identify the monomials @xmath160 ( respectively @xmath161 ) of @xmath167 with the monomials @xmath168 ( resp .",
    "@xmath169 ) of @xmath170 .",
    "it is an easy ( and long ) exercise to verify that corresponding monomials behave analogously in both cases .    with this interpretation , it is not hard to find a binomial formula for @xmath11 @xcite : @xmath171    the recurrence is given by @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath172    rogers @xcite works with a third polynomial that yields the same mahler measure : @xmath173    an interesting fact is that the polynomial @xmath174 corresponds to counting closed circuits in the face - centered cubic lattice .",
    "a closed form is given in @xcite : @xmath175 we obtain @xmath176    we compute the recurrence for @xmath80 .",
    "first consider @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "then the @xmath179 satisfy @xmath180 as before , we write @xmath181 and @xmath116 .    the differential equation for @xmath182 is given by @xmath183    in terms of @xmath184 , @xmath185 @xmath186 which translates into the recursion @xmath187",
    "@xmath188    finally , @xmath189 @xmath190 with @xmath191 .",
    "a possible way to compute these recurrences is to use the algorithms in @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , a result of rogers @xcite ( based on techniques of rodriguez - villegas @xcite ) relates the power series corresponding to the cubic lattice ( easily related to the honeycomb as we have already noticed ) and the diamond lattice to hypergeometric functions :              it is possible then , to combine the differential equation for the generalized hypergeometric function and the formula for @xmath36 in order to obtain the recurrence .",
    "in fact , the details for the diamond lattice can be found in section 4 of @xcite .    * acknowledgements *",
