    "the purpose of this paper is to begin to advance the work of deligne - rapoport , katz - mazur , edixhoven , and others regarding the stable model of @xmath6 . in the simplest case of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , the minimal resolution over @xmath9",
    "is always semi - stable and was explicitly described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vi.6.16 ) .",
    "edixhoven later worked out the minimal resolution of the katz - mazur model for @xmath6 over @xmath9 ( special case of @xcite ) , but this model is never semi - stable when @xmath10 .",
    "however , in the @xmath11 case , edixhoven did go on to work out a semi - stable model for @xmath12 over a finite extension of @xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , as edixhoven states in the introduction , his methods do not generalize sufficiently to calculate the stable model when @xmath14 because of `` wild ramification . ''",
    "recently , more progress toward understanding the stable model of @xmath6 has been made by coleman using a moduli - theoretic approach . in @xcite coleman showed that for @xmath5 the ordinary region of @xmath6 has exactly @xmath15 connected components ( over @xmath16 ) , whose reductions can be described using igusa curves",
    ". he also was able to give a moduli - theoretic interpretation of the horizontal components of edixhoven s model for @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , the points on these components correspond to pairs @xmath17 such that @xmath18 $ ] is in the language of @xcite too - supersingular , i.e. that @xmath18 $ ] has no canonical subgroup .    in the first half of this paper we begin with the model for @xmath0",
    "constructed in @xcite , and apply techniques of rigid analysis to construct a semi - stable covering .",
    "from this point on , all such statements will always mean over @xmath19 , the ring of integers in @xmath16 .",
    "paraphrasing @xcite , this means that we will find a finite set of disjoint affinoids @xmath20 with good reduction , such that the complement in @xmath0 of @xmath21 is simply the disjoint union of annuli .",
    "by @xcite this is equivalent to determining a semi - stable model for the curve .",
    "the goal of the remaining sections , then , is to provide a moduli - theoretic interpretation of the components that leads to a conjecture regarding the stable model of @xmath4 . to do this we first map the affinoids in the semi - stable covering down to @xmath3 via an appropriate moduli - theoretic map ( using formulas from @xcite ) .",
    "then we show by explicit calculations that the images contain the @xmath2-invariants of curves with a certain type of complex multiplication . along with similar data for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,",
    "this leads to two conjectures which could be considered the main results of the paper .",
    "conjecture [ conjecture : mainconjecture1 ] concerns the distribution of cm curves inside a given @xmath24 disk of @xmath3 , and conjecture [ conjecture : mainconjecture2 ] generalizes the stable model description of @xmath0 to a description of @xmath4 .",
    "these conjectures will be at least partially proven in an upcoming joint work with robert coleman .",
    "in this section we determine the stable model for @xmath0 ( genus @xmath25 ) by essentially constructing in the language of @xcite a semi - stable covering for the curve .",
    "the initial model will be the one determined in @xcite , namely the following system of equations .",
    "@xmath26 @xmath27 as modular functions , the @xmath28-expansions at infinity of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 can be expressed in terms of the dedekind eta - function as follows .",
    "@xmath32 in @xcite it is shown that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are functions on @xmath0 which are fixed by the atkin - lehner involution , @xmath33 .",
    "therefore equation actually describes the genus two quotient curve , @xmath34 then @xmath31 is a third function on @xmath0 ( actually a pullback of a function on @xmath35 ) which generates , by equation , the degree @xmath36 extension from @xmath37 up to @xmath0 .    in later sections we will want to interpret the various components of our model in moduli - theoretic terms in the hopes of conjecturing what happens in general ( for @xmath4 , @xmath38 ) . for this section , however , we will stick to bare - bones rigid analysis .",
    "first we show that @xmath37 has good reduction by finding an explicit good reduction model .",
    "then we show that the @xmath39 ramification points in the degree two extension lie in two equidistant sets of @xmath40 , all within a wide - open annulus .",
    "the result of this information is that the stable model of @xmath0 has @xmath40 components , four of genus @xmath36 and one of genus @xmath41 . in particular , two components with the same ( stable ) reduction as @xmath37",
    "will be switched under the atkin - lehner involution .",
    "the other two genus @xmath36 affinoids are fixed by atkin - lehner and have trivial quotients .      at the end of @xcite",
    "there is a proof that @xmath37 has good reduction which is based on a hyperelliptic model for the genus @xmath36 curve . in order to understand the extension up to @xmath0",
    ", however , this hyperelliptic model is not optimal . for this reason we will now offer a proof using a different model , one which will be more appropriate for the full analysis of @xmath0 .",
    "essentially , we will show that with respect to the parameter @xmath30 the affinoid @xmath42 is a genus @xmath36 affinoid ( in the sense of @xcite ) with good reduction .",
    "then in the section that follows we will see that the @xmath39 ramification points in the degree two extension up to @xmath0 are actually separated from this affinoid by a wide open annulus .",
    "this is a key point in understanding the stable model of @xmath0 .",
    "we begin by choosing any @xmath43 satisfying @xmath44 and making the change of variables @xmath45 .",
    "plugging into @xmath46 we then obtain a polynomial @xmath47 whose coefficients are polynomials in @xmath48 and are given below in table [ x0-y - model ] .",
    "the entry in the @xmath49 row and @xmath50 column is the coefficient of @xmath51 .",
    "if true , the preceeding conjecture would provide at least the beginning of a moduli - theoretic description of the components in the stable model for @xmath0 .",
    "however , at the end of the paper we will seek to propose a general conjecture for the stable model of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we will want to know how conjecture [ conjecture : cmp5 ] generalizes to other primes .",
    "for this reason we have also checked a number of examples for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and have found that the data consistently supports conjectures [ conjecture : cmp7 ] and [ conjecture : cmp13 ] .",
    "all three conjectures will be tied together with a general conjecture in next and final section of the paper .          for a conjecture regarding the components in the stable model of @xmath4 ,",
    "it is at least clear what `` types '' of components are suggested by the @xmath0 data .",
    "we will naturally conjecture that in general , for each supersingular elliptic curve ( at least defined over @xmath65 ) , we have components that look like @xmath66 , @xmath67 , the four genus @xmath36 components , and the trivial component which intersects the others .",
    "in other words , we will conjecture that there are components which have the same moduli - theoretic properties that the components in our semi - stable covering of @xmath0 have been proven or conjectured to have . of the various ways in which to improve such a conjecture , one way would certainly be to conjecture the number of such components and give an explanation of the number .",
    "this we will do with the help of lemma [ lemma : ap ] .",
    "conjecture [ conjecture : mainconjecture1 ] uses the lemma to generalize the conjectures of the previous section regarding the placement of cm @xmath2-invariants .",
    "conjecture [ conjecture : mainconjecture2 ] then takes this into account in describing the stable model of @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper with a guess which goes one step farther and predicts the genera of the components .",
    "the action is simply conjugation , after identifying @xmath82 with @xmath83 $ ] of course .",
    "now , for part ( 1 ) let @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "then by definition , @xmath86 solving and setting @xmath87 and @xmath88 coefficients equal , this leads to the following system of linear equations in @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 when @xmath92 , i.e. when @xmath93 , the system is trivially satisfied for all @xmath94 . when @xmath95 , however , the determinant is @xmath96 and therefore @xmath97 is the only solution .",
    "similarly , it is a straightforward exercise in congruences to verify half of part ( 2 ) , namely that @xmath98 implies @xmath99 .",
    "this means that as soon as @xmath100 has one solution , it must have at least @xmath101 solutions by part ( 1 ) . but",
    "@xmath102 always has a solution since the set @xmath103 has @xmath104 elements and therefore must contain a quadratic residue .",
    "therefore we are done since there are @xmath105 choices for @xmath106 , @xmath101 solutions to @xmath102 , and only @xmath107 nonzero elements of @xmath108 to begin with .",
    "the reason that this lemma is relevant is the following .",
    "let @xmath109 be a supersingular curve so that @xmath110 .",
    "the isomorphism is non - canonical , but it suffices to choose an isomorphism once and for all .",
    "now suppose that @xmath111 is a cm curve with @xmath112 and such that @xmath113 .",
    "identify @xmath114 with a subring of @xmath16 via the canonical embedding coming from the action of @xmath114 on holomorphic differentials .",
    "then for every isomorphism @xmath115 we obtain an embedding @xmath116 .",
    "furthermore , part ( 2 ) of lemma [ lemma : ap ] implies that for any uniformizer @xmath117 , the conjugacy class of @xmath118 inside @xmath110 is independent of @xmath119 .",
    "so without taking @xmath119 into account , there are only @xmath101 options for the image of @xmath118 inside @xmath120 .",
    "to illustrate this point , consider the following example .",
    "[ example : p7 ] let @xmath53 be a curve with @xmath121 $ ] , and let @xmath109 be the unique supersingular elliptic curve in characteristic @xmath122",
    ". from @xcite we may take @xmath123 to be a maximal order in the quaternion algebra @xmath124 $ ] with @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the uniformizer @xmath128 and suppose that for a particular isomorphism @xmath115 we have @xmath129 . since @xmath130 we must immediately have @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( mod @xmath122 ) . therefore we have @xmath133 , which means that for this example the image of @xmath118 inside @xmath134 must lie in the conjugacy class ( of @xmath25 elements ) containing @xmath135    however , the precise image of @xmath118 is _ not _ independent of @xmath119 .",
    "so we can not yet use this image to put an equivalence relation on the set of curves with a given endomorphism ring . to obtain an invariant which is independent of @xmath119 , we first note that @xmath136 acts transitively on the set of isomorphisms from @xmath137 to @xmath123 via conjugation , with @xmath138 as the kernel in all cases . so letting @xmath139 we see that the conjugacy class defined by @xmath31 inside of @xmath120 can be broken down into @xmath140 subsets , so that the _ subset _ containing the image of @xmath118 is now independent of @xmath119 .",
    "again , we illustrate this point by revisiting the previous example .",
    "[ example : p7b ] the unique supersingular curve @xmath109 in characteristic @xmath122 has @xmath141 . in terms of the above identification , the automorphism group is generated by the ( invertible ) element @xmath142 .",
    "so for example , if @xmath143 for some @xmath119 , then @xmath144 .",
    "this means that if we want to associate to @xmath31 an element of @xmath134 which is _ independent _ of @xmath119 , we can _ not _ distinguish between @xmath145 .",
    "similarly , conjugation by @xmath142 breaks down the entire set of eight elements into four subsets of order @xmath36 , namely @xmath146 so independent of @xmath119 , it makes sense to say that there are @xmath147 options for the image of @xmath118 in @xmath134 .",
    "the result of the preceeding argument is that we have shown how to put an equivalence relation with @xmath140 ( possibly empty ) classes on the set of cm curves @xmath148 reducing to a fixed supersingular curve @xmath109 and with a fixed endomorphism ring such that @xmath112 . indeed , with the same argument we may even generalize the relation by requiring only that @xmath149 be fixed . since there are only two ramified quadratic extensions of @xmath150 ,",
    "this makes a total of @xmath151 classes into which all such cm curves must fall .",
    "what we have _ not _ shown , however , is that this equivalence relation is reflected somehow in the geometric placement of the @xmath2-invariants of these cm curves inside of @xmath3 .",
    "so we have provided evidence for conjecture [ conjecture : mainconjecture1 ] , which would explain conjectures [ conjecture : cmp5 ] , [ conjecture : cmp7 ] , and [ conjecture : cmp13 ] with a general theory .",
    "however , we do not yet have a proof of the result at this time .",
    "[ conjecture : mainconjecture1 ] let @xmath109 be a supersingular elliptic curve defined over @xmath65 and let @xmath152 .",
    "+ ( 1 ) the @xmath2-invariants of all cm curves @xmath111 such that @xmath153 and @xmath154 lie in @xmath151 residue disks inside the corresponding atkin - lehner + circle , @xmath140 for each ramified quadratic extension of @xmath150 .",
    "+   + ( 2 ) two such curves , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , lie in the same residue disk iff @xmath155 and for any uniformizer @xmath156 of the common image we have + @xmath157 for some @xmath158 , @xmath159 .    [ conjecture : mainconjecture2 ] there is a semi - stable covering of @xmath4 defined over @xmath19 such that for each supersingular elliptic curve @xmath109 defined over @xmath65 there is a connected component of the supersingular locus containing ( only ) the following .",
    "+ ( 1 ) one component lying via @xmath160 over the atkin - lehner circle ( of @xmath109 ) , + ( 2 ) two components , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are @xmath161 and @xmath162 of the + too - supersingular disk ( of @xmath109 ) , and + ( 3 ) @xmath151 components lying via @xmath160 over the cm disks of + conjecture [ conjecture : mainconjecture1 ] .",
    "+ the intersections of these components with each other and with the @xmath163 ordinary components of @xmath4 are as pictured in figure [ figure : stablep3graph ] .",
    "it is important to acknowledge that conjecture [ conjecture : mainconjecture2 ] is based on just one very well understood example .",
    "ironically , however , if we make a more precise conjecture it is easy to obtain far more corroborating data . in particular , from looking more closely at the @xmath0 example one might go so far as to guess the following .",
    "the component lying over al is trivial , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are analytically isomorphic copies of edixhoven s horizontal component , and each component lying over a cm disk has genus @xmath164 ( and is hyperelliptic ) .",
    "these statements also hold for @xmath0 , and with the guess it becomes possible to generate complete graphs of conjectural semi - stable models for @xmath4 .",
    "the genera of each @xmath66 and @xmath67 come directly from @xcite .",
    "the genera of the ordinary components come from @xcite and the fact ( from @xcite ) that the four nontrivial ordinary components of @xmath4 are isomorphic copies of the two nontrivial ordinary components of @xmath12 .",
    "using this approach we have generated graphs for @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 ( figures [ figure : graph7 ] , [ figure : graph13 ] , and [ figure : graph17 ] ) . in each of these cases , and in fact even in the _ general _ case , it is easy to show that the total genus of the curve is at least correct .",
    "while it is perhaps too early to make the guess an official conjecture , the corroborating data of this genus calculation seems to be very promising .",
