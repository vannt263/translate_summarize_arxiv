    "the galaxy three - point function @xmath0 provides a crucial test and valuable statistical tool to investigate the origin of structure formation and the relationship between galaxies and dark matter ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "we will concentrate here on the reduced 3-point function @xmath15 defined in eq.[fiftheq ] as the scaling expected from non - linear couplings ( with @xmath16 )",
    ". measurements of the three - point function and other higher - order statistics in galaxy catalogs have a rich history ( eg @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the past decade , three - point statistics have confirmed the basic picture of gravitational instability from gaussian initial conditions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the connection between these observables and theoretical predictions is best done on large scales , where the physics ( gravity ) is best understood , but the surveys previously available were not large enough to have good statistics on sufficiently large scales .    with the completion of large redshift surveys such as 2dfgrs",
    "( @xcite ) and sdss ( @xcite ) we expect measurement of higher - order statistics to provide tighter constraints on cosmology ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "first measurements of the redshift space @xmath0 in the 2dfgrs ( @xcite ) and sdss ( eg @xcite ) show good agreement with expectations ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we will assume here that the initial conditions are gaussian .",
    "current models of structure formation predict a small level of initial non - gaussianities that we can neglect here .",
    "a popular parametrization of this effect is to assume that initial curvature perturbations , given by the gravitational potential , @xmath17 , are given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is gaussian and @xmath20 is a non - linear coupling parameter of order unity .",
    "this produces non - gaussianities in the matter density perturbations at wavenumber @xmath21 which , using the poisson equation , are suppressed by the square of the horizon scale @xmath22 , so that : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the so called cdm transfer function and @xmath25 is the growth factor . in our analysis",
    "@xmath26 so that these type of primordial non - gaussianities produce negligible contribution to @xmath3 for models with @xmath27",
    ". a more detailed analysis of this will be presented elsewhere ( see @xcite for a detailed forecast for this model ) .",
    "if the non - gaussianities come from a non - linear coupling in the matter density field rather than in the gravitational potential , the resulting 3-point function will have a non - gaussian contribution similar to that produced by non - linear bias @xmath11 ( ie see eq.[eq : q3 g ] below and conclusions ) .",
    "the shape and amplitude of @xmath3 depends on galaxy bias , ie how galaxy light traces the dark matter ( dm ) distribution .",
    "this is both a problem and an opportunity . a problem because biasing can confuse our interpretation of the observations .",
    "an opportunity because one can try to measure the biasing parameters out of @xmath3 .",
    "this idea was first proposed by @xcite and has been applied to the 3-point function and bispectrum of real data ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is the third on a series of papers on clustering of lrg . in the first two papers @xcite we studied redshift space distortions on the 2-point correlation function .",
    "the reader is referred to these papers for more details on the lrg samples , simulations and the systematic effects .",
    "similar lrg samples from sdss have already been used by different groups to study the 2-point function ( eg @xcite ) and found good agreement with predictions in the bao scales , where density fluctuations are at a level of few percent .",
    "this is encouraging and indicates that this sample is large and accurate enough to investigate clustering on such large scales .    in this paper",
    "we follow closely the methodology presented in 3 previous analysis .",
    "@xcite presented a comparison of the predictions for the two and three - point correlation functions of density fluctuations , @xmath4 and @xmath0 , in gravitational perturbation theory ( pt ) against large cold dark matter ( cdm ) simulations .",
    "here we use the same method and codes to estimate the clustering in simulations .",
    "@xcite extend these results into the non - linear regime and focus on the effects of redshift distortions and the extraction of galaxy bias parameters in galaxy surveys .",
    "@xcite apply this methodology to the 2dfgrs . here",
    "we apply the very same techniques to the lrg data , so the reader is referred to these papers for more details .",
    "@xcite have also estimated @xmath0 using lrg galaxies from sdss dr3 , but focusing on smaller scales .",
    "we use dr6 which has 3 times the area ( and volume ) of dr3 .",
    "we also use a volume limited sample and a different estimator for the correlation functions and errors , focusing on the largest scales .",
    "the two and three - point correlation functions are defined , respectively , as _ 2(r_12 ) & = & ( r_1 ) ( r_2 ) + _ 3(r_12,r_23,r_13 ) & = & ( r_1 ) ( r_2 ) ( r_3 ) where @xmath28 is the local density fluctuation about the mean @xmath29 , and the expectation value is taken over different realizations of the model or physical process . in practice , the expectation value is over different spatial regions in our universe , which are assumed to be a fair sample of possible realizations ( see peebles 1980 ) .",
    "a possible complication with this approach is the so call finite volume effects which result in potential estimation and ratio biases ( eg see @xcite ) . for our samples",
    "we have checked using a large simulation that these potential estimation biases are small compared to the errors .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[fig : q3sim ] below which shows a good agreement between predictions and mock simulations that have the same size than the sdss sample that we used in our analysis .",
    "we use a simulation with about 512 more volume than the data .",
    "we split this large simulation into 512 subsamples and estimate the mean and error ( from the variance ) of the 2 and 3-point correlation functions in the 512 subsamples .",
    "we find that this mean agrees well , well within the error , with the corresponding correlation estimated in the full simulation .",
    "this indicates that the finite volume effects are negligible compared to errors ( see also fig.5 in paper iv , @xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to define a @xmath3 parameter as @xcite    @xmath30    where we have introduced a definition for the `` hierarchical '' three - point function @xmath31 .",
    "note that , by homogeneity , the 3-point function @xmath0 or @xmath3 can only depend on the distance between @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this involves 3 variables that define the triangle formed by the 3 points . in principle",
    "@xmath3 could depend on the geometry and scale of the triangle . here",
    "we will use two of the triangle sides @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the co - sinus of the angle between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which we call @xmath40 .",
    "thus @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath3 parameter was thought to be roughly constant as a function of triangle shape and scale ( @xcite ) , a result that is usually referred to as the hierarchical scaling .",
    "accurate measurements / predictions show that @xmath3 is not quite constant in any regime of clustering , although the variations of @xmath3 with scale and shape are small compared to the corresponding changes in @xmath4 or @xmath0 , specially at small scales .",
    "we will illustrate next how measurements of @xmath3 provide a direct estimation of the non - linear mode coupling of density and velocity fluctuations .",
    "first consider the fully non - linear fluid equations that determine the gravitational evolution of density fluctuations , @xmath42 , and the divergence of the velocity field , @xmath43 , in an expanding universe for a pressureless irrotational fluid . in fourier space",
    "( see eq.37 - 38 in @xcite ) : @xmath44 where derivatives are over time @xmath45 and @xmath46 . on",
    "the left hand side @xmath47 and @xmath48 are functions of the fourier wave vector @xmath21 .",
    "the integrals are over vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 constrained to @xmath51 .",
    "the right hand side of the equation include the non - linear terms which are quadratic in the field and contain the mode coupling functions : @xmath52 where `` @xmath53 '' is the scalar product of the vectors ( eq.39 in @xcite ) .",
    "this functions , @xmath40 and @xmath54 , account for the mixing of fourier modes .",
    "note that this functions are adimensional and depend on the geometry of the triangle formed by the two wave vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 that contribute to @xmath55 .",
    "the scalar product indicates that mode couplings are larger when the modes are aligned .",
    "physically this means that density and velocity gradients created by ( non - linear ) gravitational growth will tend to be parallel .",
    "consider now the following perturbation expansions : @xmath56 the first terms , @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the above series are the linear solution of the fluid equations eq.[eq : fluid ] , where we neglect the quadratic terms in the equations .",
    "the linear term yields @xmath59 for the first fluid equation in eq.[eq : fluid ] . combined with the second fluid equation yields the well known harmonic oscillator equation for the linear growth :",
    "@xmath60 this equation is valid in fourier or in configuration space . in linear theory",
    "each fourier mode evolves independently of the other and they all grow linearly out of the initial fields with the same growth function , ie @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the value of the field at some initial time and @xmath63 is the linear growth function , which is a solution to the above harmonic equation . if the initial field @xmath62 is gaussian then @xmath57 is also gaussian .",
    "as shown above mode coupling is a non - linear effect . by construction , the next terms in the series of eq.[eq : series ] , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , are assumed to be quadratic in the linear terms , ie @xmath66 .",
    "the solution for the second order can be found by just replacing the above expansion into the fluid equations keeping the second order terms in the equation .",
    "first order terms in the left side of the fluid equations in eq.[eq : fluid ] vanish by construction of the linear equation .",
    "we then find ( see eq.156 in @xcite ) : @xmath67 thus the second order term in the expansion is @xmath68 and contains the mode coupling information through @xmath69 .",
    "let s consider now the observables , which are the 2 and 3-point correlation functions .",
    "note that for an initially gaussian field @xmath57 is also gaussian so that @xmath70 and @xmath71 . at leading order the 2-point function @xmath4",
    "is dominated by the linear evolution and the second to leading order term is zero because @xmath72 .",
    "thus we have @xmath73 . the linear contribution to @xmath0",
    "is also zero and the leading order in @xmath0 comes from having @xmath64 in one of the 3 points and @xmath57 in the other 2 points . for illustration , let us ignore for now the arguments of the 3 points , and see how things scale : @xmath74 this is in agreement with the scaling @xmath75 in eq.[fiftheq ] .",
    "we therefore have that @xmath3 at leading order is just proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "this is exactly the case when we account for the arguments in the 3 points , as can be easily checked .",
    "the dependence of @xmath69 on the triangular configuration , ie through eq.[eq : mode ] , is all contained in the corresponding triangular configurations of @xmath3 , ie @xmath41 .",
    "this shows the interest of measuring @xmath3 : it provides a direct way to measure the mode coupling information in @xmath69 , which includes the fully non - linear coupling in eq.[eq : mode ] .",
    "higher order correlations just provide information about different combinations of coupling functions @xmath40 and @xmath54 .",
    "we can now address the following question : is large scale structure produced by gravitational growth from small gaussian fluctuations ?",
    "we could answer this question by measuring @xmath76 . if we knew some initial conditions @xmath77 , we can then estimate @xmath78 and compare to the linear solution of eq.[eq : harmonic ] . by measuring @xmath3",
    "we can directly compare to @xmath69 .",
    "this is independent of the linear test in @xmath63 and does not require knowledge of the initial conditions @xmath77 .",
    "the result should in fact be independent of time .",
    "we can also test gravitational growth with independence of time or initial conditions by using the linear relation between density and velocities , @xmath59 .",
    "but this is a test of linear evolution and requires measurements of the velocity field ( this , in fact , is tested using redshift space distortions in paper - i of this series ) . @xmath3 only needs density fields and explores the non - linear sector of gravity .",
    "if the origin of structure is non gravitational ( or gravity is non - standard ) but the initial conditions are gaussian , then on dimensional grounds we would also expect @xmath73 and @xmath3 to be indepent of time . but both the amplitude and shape of @xmath3 as a function of triangle configuration could be quite different if the fluid equations are different , either because of a non - standard cosmology or non - standard law of gravity ( eg see @xcite ) . in the standard case ,",
    "the shape of @xmath69 is mostly independent of cosmological parameters ( eg @xmath79 , @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) , time or the amplitude of fluctuations @xcite . as shown above , density and velocity gradients produced by non - linear evolution",
    "are parallel which results in enhancement of clustering for elongated triangles .",
    "the exact amplitude as a function of triangular shape provides a finger print for non - linear gravitational growth .",
    "it is purely a non - linear effect that is not present in the initial conditions ( which are assumed to be gaussian with @xmath82 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the prediction for @xmath3 depends not only on the mode coupling @xmath69 but also on the slope of the initial @xmath77 .",
    "models with relatively more large scale power ( ie smaller slope ) produce structures with larger coherence which give rise to more anisotropic structures and stronger shape dependence in @xmath3 .",
    "fortunately the shape of @xmath4 can also be estimated from data and one can then test the mode coupling predictions for @xmath69 , as we will show below .      as mentioned above",
    ", there is a degeneracy in the shape of @xmath3 between dark matter density @xmath79 and baryon density @xmath83 because they produce degenerate slopes in @xmath4 .",
    "this degeneracy is broken by the presence of the bao peak , but this requires a measurement at 100 mpc / h scales . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider a power law spectrum @xmath84 . in this case",
    "( see  @xcite and references therein ) :    @xmath85   \\xi_2(r_{12})\\xi(r_{23})+\\cal{p}\\nonumber   \\label{sixtheq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 stands for permutations of the indexes 123 , and @xmath37 is the co - sinus of the angle between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which we call @xmath40 .",
    "here we will only show results as a function of @xmath40 for fixed @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the above formula is only valid for a power - law spectrum .",
    "for cdm we will use a full calculation as explained below .",
    "elongated or  collapsed configurations `` are those with @xmath87 or @xmath88 deg .",
    "we use the term ' ' strong configuration dependence `` when there is a significant difference between the collapsed and the perpendicular configurations . by ' ' weak configuration dependence \" we mean that @xmath3 is `` hierarchical '' ( ie constant as a function of @xmath40 ) .",
    "@xmath89 flattens with the decrease of the spectral index @xmath90 and for larger @xmath90 has a strong configuration dependence with a characteristic `` v '' shape .",
    "this corresponds to a larger probability of finding 3 points aligned , a direct consequence of gravitational infall that enhances the filaments that are characteristic of large scale structure both in simulations and real data . in a cdm spectrum",
    "this dependence on @xmath90 translates into flat @xmath3 ( rounder structures ) at small scales progressively getting stronger v - shape as the effective @xmath90 gets larger because of the cdm transfer function . at a fixed scale ,",
    "the v - shape gets more pronounced when we increase @xmath79 or when we decrease @xmath83 .",
    "this is just due to the effect of @xmath79 and @xmath83 in the cdm transfer function , which changes the effective spectral index @xmath90 . if we fix the shape of the @xmath91 spectrum , the values of @xmath79 and @xmath83 have very little effect on @xmath3 , as mentioned above .",
    "these points are illustrated in fig.[fig : q3th ] which shows perturbation theory predictions for @xmath3 .",
    "for this calculation we use eq.(8 ) in @xcite , where different scales and triangular configurations are also shown . here",
    "we focus on the results of @xmath3 around the bao scales . for high values of @xmath83",
    "a baryonic peak emerges in @xmath3 and this peak could be used as a cosmological prove or to break the @xmath92 degeneracy .",
    "the peak is present in all @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "as far as we know this is the first calculation illustrating how the bao peak shows in @xmath89 .     for different values of @xmath79 and @xmath83 , as labeled in the figure .",
    "all cases are unbiased , except for dotted line which corresponds to @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this is for triangles with two sides fixed to @xmath97 mpc / h and @xmath98 mpc / h as a function of the interior angle @xmath40 between this two sides . as @xmath40 varies from @xmath99 degrees the third side of the triangle changes from @xmath100 mpc / h to @xmath101 mpc / h",
    ". for high values of @xmath83 a bao peak ( marked by the arrow ) shows at @xmath102 degrees , which corresponds to @xmath103 mpc / h .",
    "the precise location depends on the cosmology used . ]",
    "predictions in redshift space are harder to make ( see @xcite ) , but on large scales simulations show that redshift distortions in @xmath0 and @xmath104 cancel out in @xmath3 , and we do not expect deviations from pt tree - level predictions ( see fig.[fig : q3sim ] below ) .",
    "the value and shape of @xmath89 changes with galaxy bias . on very large scales",
    "we expect that galaxy fluctuations @xmath105 can be modeled as a local ( but non - linear ) function of the corresponding matter fluctuations @xmath42 , so that @xmath106 $ ] . for small fluctuations , @xmath107 , we can expand this local function as :    @xmath108 \\simeq \\sum_{i}~{b_i\\over{i!}}~\\delta^i , \\label{eq : bk}\\ ] ]    where @xmath109 comes from the requirement that @xmath110 .",
    "it then follows ( see @xcite , @xcite ) that : @xmath111 where @xmath112 , and the @xmath113 sign indicates that this is the leading order contribution in the expansion given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bk ] ) above .",
    "thus , in general , the linear bias prescription is not accurate for higher - order moments even when @xmath114 , the reason being that non - linearities generate non - gaussianities of the same order as those of gravitational origin .",
    "the linear bias term @xmath10 can produce distortions in the shape of @xmath3 , while the non - linear terms @xmath11 only shifts the curve .",
    "this is illustrated by the dotted line in fig.[fig : q3th ] .",
    "it is therefore possible , but challenging , to use the shape of @xmath115 in observations , when compared to the dm predictions , to separate @xmath10 from @xmath11 in the above relation .",
    "this gives an estimate of the linear bias @xmath10 which is independent of the overall amplitude of clustering ( eg .",
    "@xmath116 ) .",
    "this approach has already been implemented for the skewness @xmath117 @xcite , the bispectrum @xcite or the angular 3-point function @xcite and has been used to forecast future analysis @xcite .",
    "to check our codes and estimate errorbars , we have used a comoving output at z=0 of a mice simulation , run in the super computer mare nostrum in barcelona by mice consortium ( www.ice.cat/mice ) .",
    "the simulation contains @xmath118 dark matter particles , in a cube of side 7680mpc / h ( which we call mice7680 ) , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "this simulation uses the power spectrum of @xcite ( eh from now on ) . to be consistent",
    ", the same approximation has also been used for the predictions .",
    "we assume here that this eh fit is good enough approximation for the precision in our analysis , but we note that @xcite found that on the bao scale this approximation is only accurate at the few percent level .",
    "we also use the eh fit with `` no wiggles '' which for each cosmological model produces a match to the smoothed shape of the power spectrum without the bao wiggles .",
    "this is equivalent to the removal of the bao peak in the correlation function but keeping the same correlation as a based line .",
    "note that we have chosen to displayed our results in terms of @xmath79 and @xmath83 for a fixed @xmath123 .",
    "the observed lrg galaxies are at a mean cosmic time of @xmath124 rather than cosmic time @xmath125 in our simulations . in principle , this should result in a slightly larger amplitude for the clustering in the simulations , because it corresponds to a later cosmic time .",
    "but the simulations have a lower normalization , @xmath126 , than the value of @xmath127 inferred for the lrg galaxies after accounting for the effect of bias ( see paper i ) .",
    "this two effects partially compensate each other and the net result is that simulations have very similar clustering amplitude to that inferred in the lrg data .    to simulate biasing we select groups of particles using friend - of - friends with linking scale of @xmath128 .",
    "we find a total of 107 million groups with more than 5 particles ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "these groups approximately correspond to dm halos when the number of particles in the group is larger than few tens of particles @xcite .",
    "when the number of particles is smaller than this , the group might not always correspond a virialized dm halo .",
    "but in any case , these groups sample high density regions which are biased tracers of the dark matter distribution",
    ". we can produce different mock galaxy catalogs by choosing the group richness ( ie mass or number of particles ) .",
    "very massive groups are more biased and more rare than smaller groups .",
    "what we do here is to select the group mass cut - off to reproduce the galaxy clustering in the lrg observations .",
    "it turns out that when we do this we get a number density of groups which is quite similar to the number density of lrg galaxies .",
    "our mock catalogs are not realistic in the sense that we have not simulated the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "but we only use these catalogs for error estimation .",
    "errors depend on the statistical properties of the simulation and not on process that produce such statistics . for our purposes here , all we need from mock simulations is that they have approximately the same volume , bias @xmath130 , number density and similar values of @xmath4 and @xmath0 that observations .",
    "errors only depend on this quantities .",
    "we have also used a mice simulation with @xmath118 dark matter particles , in a cube of side 3072mpc / h ( which we call mice3072 , same parameters as mice7680 ) which has 15 times better mass resolution to check for mass resolution effects .",
    "we find very similar results in both cases , but obviously mice7680 provides more sampling volume to estimate reliable errors .",
    "when we select groups with @xmath131 , both the clustering amplitude ( @xmath132 for @xmath121 ) and the number density ( @xmath133 ) are similar to the real lrg galaxies in our sdss sample ( the range reflects the fact that the actual number depend on lrg sample used ) . as the mock simulations are similar to the real data we will use the variance of clustering in the simulations to estimate errorbars for our analysis .",
    "the resulting errors from simulations are typically in good agreement with jk errors from the real data ( see paper i for details ) . we will also check if we can recover the theory predictions for @xmath3 by using mock simulations with similar size as the real data .",
    "we have divided the big mice7680 cube in @xmath134 sub - cubes , each of side",
    "961mpc / h and apply the lrg sdss mask to obtain @xmath135 lrg mocks from both dark matter and groups . from the @xmath136 mock catalogs , we can estimate what we call the monte carlo ( mc ) covariance matrix :    @xmath137    where @xmath138 is the measure of @xmath4 , @xmath0 or @xmath3 in the k - th mock simulation ( @xmath139 ) and @xmath140 is the mean over @xmath141 realizations .",

    "are almost identical to redshift space for both dark matter ( left panel ) and groups with @xmath129 ( right panel ) .",
    "the pt predictions and the biasing predictions work remarkably well . for bias",
    "we have used @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( continuous lines ) .",
    "the value @xmath142 is estimated empirically from the ratio of the 2-point function of the groups to that of dark matter .",
    "this ratio is fairly constant for @xmath144 .",
    "the non - linear bias @xmath11 produces a global shift that we have just fitted to the data .",
    "these estimated values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 agree very well with halo model prediction @xcite for the mass of these groups .",
    "we note that we show the mean of the 512 mocks with errors from the dispersion in redshift space , which are slightly smaller ( 10 - 30% ) than in real space .",
    "dotted lines show results from two of the 512 realizations , illustrating the strong covariance in @xmath89 .",
    "we apply a @xmath145 method to fit the models by inverting the covariance matrix @xmath146 , as explained in @xcite . before inverting @xmath146 in eq.(8 ) , notice that the values of @xmath146 are estimated in practice to within a limited resolution in eq.[eq : covmc ] , @xmath147 .",
    "therefore if the number of mocks @xmath141 is small or if there are degeneracies in @xmath146 , the inversion will be affected by numerical instabilities . in order to eliminate this problem",
    ", we perform a singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the matrix . by doing the svd decomposition",
    ", we can choose the number of modes we wish to include in our @xmath145 by effectively setting the corresponding inverses of the small singular values to zero .",
    "in practice , we work only with the subspace of  dominant modes \" which satisfy @xmath148 which is the resolution to which we can estimate the covariance matrix elements .",
    "typically results converge after using a few singular values .",
    "most of the times there is no gain in using more components which indicates that the effective number of degrees of freedom is smaller than the number of bins .",
    "sometimes the fit gets bad when using larger number of components , which indicates instabilities in the covariance inversion .",
    "the results presented here are quite robust .",
    "we find that they are basically the same when we use different covariance matrices , corresponding to samples with different amplitude of clustering or different shot - noise , within the range that roughly matches the data .",
    "in particular , results are quite similar when we use dm particles mocks instead of groups mocks to estimate @xmath146 .",
    "the absolute errors in @xmath3 are roughly the same for dark matter and groups , despite the difference in the amplitude .",
    "this give us confidence that what we find in real data is not an artifact of our analysis .",
    "fig.[fig : eigenv ] shows the first 6 eigenvectors or principal components , which resemble an harmonic decomposition of @xmath89 , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the first component is roughly a constant , like a monopole , the second component corresponds to the  v  shape mentioned above , like a quadrupole , and the third ( short - dashed line ) is similar to a dipole .",
    "the next components resemble higher multipoles and can be combined to define localized structure in @xmath89 . with the first two components it is not possible to break the @xmath149 degeneracy ,",
    "given the errorbars .",
    "we have checked this in both the lrg data and the simulations .",
    "as we increase the number of multipoles we can see how the degeneracy in the @xmath149 plane begins to break down .",
    "the bao feature only shows in the higher components and breaks the @xmath149 degeneracy for large values of @xmath150 .",
    "lower values show no significant bao peak , given the errors , and this results in a strong degeneracy in @xmath149 .",
    "we have played with the models and find that even if we artificially reduce the errors we need more that 2 eigenvalues to have a @xmath83 detection .",
    "in fig.[fig : omobsim ] we show how well we can recover the values of @xmath151 from the mocks shown in fig.[fig : q3sim ] .",
    "we use 9 singular values , as in the lrg data , but results are quite similar from 5 to 9 singular values . in the case of dark matter (",
    "left panel in fig.[fig : omobsim ] ) , we do not include biasing parameters . in the case of groups ( right panel )",
    "the results are marginalized for @xmath12 and @xmath152 .",
    "the best fit value is in excellent agreement with the input values both for @xmath151 and for @xmath153 .",
    "this illustrates that fitting @xmath10 and @xmath11 from @xmath3 in groups could be used to roughly estimate the mass of the groups or galaxy clusters .",
    "but even when we recover well the input value , note how errors are large and produce degenerate values at 2-sigma level for the size of our mock sample . as we will see below ,",
    "this is because @xmath81 is low in the simulation .",
    "the volume of data in a single mock , of about 1 ( gpc / h)@xmath154 , is not large enough to break the @xmath151 degeneracy for low values of @xmath81 .",
    "this could be improved by using more shape configurations in @xmath3 or smaller smoothing scales ( we use cubic pixels with 11 mpc / h on a side ) .",
    "the second ( weaker ) minimum @xmath145 that shows in fig.[fig : omobsim ] for larger values of @xmath155 corresponds the case where the bao peak moves to smaller values of @xmath40 and overlaps with the valley of the `` v '' shape in @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath3 amplitude is low and the relative error is large in this region .",
    "this allows a bao peak to be compatible with the simulations .",
    "this will also affect our lrg measurements in observations , although in this case the relative error is much smaller thanks to the non - linear bias @xmath11 which increases the overall amplitude of @xmath89 and allows a more significant detection of @xmath81 .",
    "the luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) are selected by color and magnitude to obtain intrinsically red galaxies in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "see @xcite or http://www.sdss.org for a complete description of the color cuts .",
    "these galaxies trace a big volume , around @xmath156 , which make them perfect to study large scale clustering .",
    "lrgs are red old elliptical galaxies , which are usually passive galaxies , with relatively low star formation rate . since they reside in the centers of big halos they are highly bias with @xmath157 , between regular galaxies and clusters .",
    "lrg s are targeted in the photometric catalog , via cuts in the ( g - r , r - i , r ) color - color - magnitude cube .",
    "note that all colors are measured using model magnitudes , and all quantities are corrected for galactic extinction following @xcite .",

    "cut ii selection adds yet more luminous red galaxies to z @xmath113 0.55 .",
    "the two cuts together result in about 12 lrg targets per @xmath168 that are not already in the main galaxy sample ( about 10 in cut i , 2 in cut ii ) .",
    "the radial distribution and magnitude - redshift diagrams for these galaxies are shown in paper i @xcite .",
    "we k - correct the r magnitude using the blanton program kcorrect. we need to k - correct the magnitudes in order to obtain the absolute magnitudes and eliminate the brightest and dimmest galaxies .",
    "we have seen that the previous cuts limit the intrinsic luminosity to a range @xmath169 , and we only eliminate from the catalog some few galaxies that lay out of the limits .",
    "once we have eliminated these extreme galaxies , we still do not have a volume limited sample at high redshift .",
    "for the 2-point function analysis we account for this using a random catalog with identical selection function but 20 times denser ( to avoid shot - noise ) .",
    "the same is done in simulations .",
    "computationally this is very time consuming ( specially as there are 512 simulations ) because it involves @xmath170 operations where @xmath171 . for the 3-point , using the random catalogs would involve @xmath172 operations which begins to be very challenging with current computer power .",
    "we will therefore use a different estimator based on a pixelization of the sample .",
    "this estimator is ideally match to a volume limited sample , where the full volume is equally sampled and there is no radial selection function ( we still have angular mask and radial boundaries ) .    for the 3-point function analysis presented in the paper we select a volume limited sample with @xmath173 and @xmath174 from the spectroscopic sample of lrg in the sdss dr6 .",
    "we choose this particular sample because it is the best compromise between volume and number density .",
    "there are about @xmath175 lrg galaxies in this sample ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "we estimate the correlation functions with a fast algorithm described in some detail in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm allows a fast calculation of two and three - point function for millions of points .",
    "the first step is to discretize the simulation box into @xmath177 cubic cells .",
    "we assign each particle to a node of this new latticed box using the nearest grid point particle assignment .",
    "we precalculate the list of relative neighbors to any given node in the lattice . to compute now the two - point and three - point correlation functions we use : _",
    "2(r_12 ) & = & _ i , j _ i _ j   + _ 3(r_12,r_23,r_13 ) & = & _ i , j , k _ i _ j _ k where @xmath178 extends over all nodes in the lattice , @xmath179 over the list of precalculated neighbors that are at a distance @xmath180 from @xmath178 , and @xmath21 is over the neighbors at distance @xmath181 from @xmath179 and @xmath182 from @xmath178 .",
    "we take @xmath183 to be equal to the pixel size .",
    "there are two sources of errors in this estimation : a ) * shot - noise * which scales as one over the square root of the number of pairs or triplets in each bin b ) * sampling variance * which scales with the amplitude of the correlations .",
    "it is easy to check that for the size and density of our sample the shot - noise term dominates over the sampling variance error .",
    "this has been checked in detailed by using dm simulations which have a large density and can be diluted to explore the shot - noise contribution to the error budget ( see also paper i ) .",
    "we choose cubical pixels of @xmath184 mpc / h on the side .",
    "this is an adequate compromise to measure bao .",
    "we want this number to be as large as possible to reduce shot - noise and to average over many triangles in a fast way . on the other hand , we need a good resolution to avoid loosing too much shape and bao information .",
    "once the pixel size is fixed to @xmath184 mpc / h we are forced to use @xmath185 which is the smaller distance that does not distort the @xmath3 shape @xcite . to reach the bao scale",
    "we need @xmath186 .",

    "the prediction depends not only on the biasing parameters , but also on the @xmath116 normalization .",

    "if we fix the @xmath149 to its best fit value , we find @xmath202 and @xmath13 .",
    "the value of the linear bias @xmath10 is in excellent agreement with what we found in paper i by fitting redshift space distortions in the 2-point function , but the error here is larger . the value of the non - linear bias @xmath203 is higher than the one we found in previous section for halos @xmath204",
    "this is not surprising as it is well known that more than one lrg can occupy a single halo , in which case @xmath11 tends to be larger for a given @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "also note that a larger value of @xmath11 makes the @xmath3 signal - to - noise larger in the lrg data than in the mice7680 group mocks .",
    "this helps defeating the shot - noise and improves the significance of the bao detection .",
    "we have studied the large scale 3-point correlation function for luminous red galaxies from sdss , and particularly the reduced @xmath1 , which measures the scaling expected from non - linear couplings .",
    "we find a well - detected peak at 105mpc / h separation that is in agreement with the predicted position of bao peak .",
    "this detection is significant since it is also imprinted in @xmath4 and @xmath0 separately .",
    "we focus our interpretation in @xmath3 because it is a measure independent of time , @xmath116 or growth factor .",
    "it only depends on the shape of the initial 2-point function and the non - linear coupling of the gravitational interaction .",
    "our result for @xmath3 is in excellent agreement with predictions from gaussian initial conditions .",
    "when we use the @xmath3 data alone ( with no fit to the 2-point function ) we are able to break the strong degeneracy between @xmath79 and @xmath83 ( see fig.[fig : omob ] ) .",
    "our detection shows a clear preference for a high value of @xmath7 .",
    "this value is larger , but still consistent at 2-@xmath205 with recent results of wmap ( @xmath206 ) . at 3-sigma level ,",
    "the @xmath92 becomes degenerate .",
    "models with no bao peak are ruled out at 99% confidence level .",
    "we have used very large realistic mock simulations to study the errors .",
    "these simulations show that @xmath3 is not significantly modified in redshift space so we can use real - space perturbation theory ( see fig.[fig : q3sim ] ) .",
    "this agreement also indicates that loop corrections are small on bao scales @xcite .",
    "this analysis is independent from 2-point statistics , which tests the linear growth of gravity , since 3-point statistics test the non - linear growth .",
    "a high value for @xmath83 is also consistent with the analysis of the peak in the 2-point correlation function shown in @xcite and in paper iv ( @xcite ) of this series , which detect a slightly higher peak than expected .",
    "we have done all the analysis with just one set of triangle configurations , with fixed sides of @xmath207 mpc / h and @xmath208 mpc / h , to center our attention to bao scale .",
    "this is about optimal , but we notice that there is much more to learn from @xmath3 , which will be presented in future analysis .",
    "results on smaller scales are consistent with what we find here .",
    "data is in excellent agreement with gaussian initial conditions , for which @xmath82 .",
    "but note that our quadratic bias detection @xmath13 is degenerate with a primordial non - gaussian ( hierarchical ) contribution .",
    "indeed the mean value of @xmath203 seems larger in observations than in halo simulations , for which we find @xmath204 .",
    "we believe that this indicates that halos are sometimes occupied by more than one galaxy , which increases the effective value of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "but if we are conservative we can not rule out a primordial non - gaussian contribution in the range @xmath209 $ ] .",
    "note that we have pixelized our data in cubical cells of side @xmath184 mpc / h . this results in some lost of small scale information but allows for a very fast method to estimate 3-point function @xcite .",
    "this is important for data , but more for simulations . in the mice7680 simulation",
    "there are close to @xmath210 particles .",
    "a brute force method to estimate 3-point correlation would require @xmath211 operations , while our method based on pixels just needed @xmath212 operations .",
    "future surveys will be able to improve much upon our measurement here .",
    "a photometric survey with @xmath213 precision ( corresponding to @xmath216 mpc / h at z=0 ) , such as in the pau survey @xcite should have enough spatial resolution to measure @xmath89 as presented in this paper ( recall that we are binning our radial distances in @xmath184 mpc / h ) .",
    "such survey could sample over 10 times the sdss dr6 volume ( ie to z=0.9 ) with 20 times better lrg number density ( ie for @xmath217 ) .",
    "fig.[fig : omobpau ] shows the forecast for such a survey , which we have simulated with the mice7680 mocks in redshift space with a photo - z of @xmath213 and for the same triangles as shown in our sdss analysis .",
    "this is just illustrative , as we have not marginalized over biasing and other cosmological uncertainties .",
