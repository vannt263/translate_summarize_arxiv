    "<S> a charge - density - like covariance is expected to characterize the transition radiation energy spectrum of a @xmath0 electron bunch as far as the charge form factor is intended to account for bunch - density effects in the radiation emission . the beam charge passing from a single electron to a high density electron bunch </S>",
    "<S> , the covariance of the transition radiation energy is expected to evolve from a charge - point - like to a charge - density - like one . besides covariance </S>",
    "<S> , the radiation energy spectrum is expected to conform to the temporal causality principle : the @xmath0 single electron amplitudes composing the radiation field are expected to propagate from the metallic screen with relative emission phases causally correlated with the temporal sequence of the @xmath0 particle collisions onto the metallic screen . in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> the case of a @xmath0 electron bunch hitting at a normal angle of incidence a flat metallic surface with arbitrary size and shape will be considered . </S>",
    "<S> for such an experimental situation , the distribution function of the @xmath0 electron longitudinal coordinates rules the temporal causality constraint into the transition radiation energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the covariance feature of the transition radiation energy spectrum deals instead with the lorentz invariance of the projection of the @xmath0 electron spatial density in the transverse plane with respect to the direction of motion of the @xmath0 electron beam . </S>",
    "<S> because of the invariance of the @xmath0 electron transverse density under a lorentz transformation with respect to the direction of motion of the electron beam , the @xmath0 single electron radiation amplitudes composing the radiation field show a covariant dependence on the distribution function of the @xmath0 electron transverse coordinates , the relative emission phases of the @xmath0 single electron radiation amplitudes being indeed only a function of the @xmath0 electron longitudinal coordinates because of the temporal causality constraint . as a consequence of the temporal causality and the covariance , both the temporal coherent and incoherent components of the radiation energy spectrum bear the covariant imprinting of the distribution function of the @xmath0 </S>",
