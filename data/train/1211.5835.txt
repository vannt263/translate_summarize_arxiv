    "they are characterized by a combination of high shock velocity and relatively low csm density , thus providing an ideal site to study the intrinsic energy distribution of relativistic electrons , less affected by absorption or cooling than other classes of sne @xcite .",

    "* ) .    in this paper , we suggest that this apparent discrepancy indeed provides a strong hint to understanding how electrons are injected into the dsa mechanism (  2 ) .",
    "we suggest a scenario which explains the different properties of the radio - emitting electrons in a unified scheme .",
    "our interpretation provides ( at least ) two observational signatures : ( 1 ) _ mm _ emissions in the first year after the explosion (  3 ) , and ( 2 ) x - ray synchrotron emissions at about 1 years after the explosion and thereafter (  4 ) . the paper is closed in  5 with concluding remarks .",
    "a major issue remains on the acceleration of electrons . for the standard dsa mechanism @xcite to work effectively",
    ", the particles must already have enough kinetic energy ( at least @xmath5 for electrons in sne iib / ib / ic , where @xmath6 is the lorentz factor ; see below ) .",
    "numerical simulations predict that the energy distribution in the high energy regime follows the linear theory of dsa ( with @xmath7 ) while in the lower energy it can be steeper @xcite .",
    "first , let us provide a simple argument on at which energy the electrons have a sufficient energy to be accelerated by the efficient dsa - like mechanism .",
    "the width of the collisionless shock wave can be approximated by the gyro radius of downstream _ thermal _ protons , while the mean free path of relativistic electrons can be approximated by the gyro radius of the _ relativistic _ electrons .",
    "then , the condition that the electron s mean free path exceeds the shock wave width is expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the shock wave velocity typically seen in young sne iib / ib / ic .",
    "the same criterion is @xmath10 for snrs with @xmath11 .",
    "this assumes the bohm limit for the strength of random magnetic field turbulence which is likely realized in the sn - csm interaction , but if it is not the case the above criterion will go down . above this energy , electrons can experience the whole compression ( @xmath12 ) , and therefore @xmath13 in the test particle limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the acceleration of electrons below this energy can be totally different : either the non - dsa pre - acceleration mechanism dominates , or these electrons are partly accelerated by the dsa in the non - linear regime @xcite where the subshock compression ratio is reduced by the feedback of the proton acceleration @xcite .",
    "these processes expected for these low energy electrons could result in a steep distribution with @xmath14 .",
    "now , we compare this critical energy scale to the energy of radio - synchrotron emitting electrons ( in _ cm _ wavelengths ) . the electron s energy and the corresponding synchrotron emission frequency",
    "are connected by @xmath15 where @xmath16 hz , and @xmath17 is the magnetic field strength behind the shock in gauss .",
    "observationally , @xmath18 g in sne iib / ib / ic and @xmath19 g in evolved snrs .",
    "we note this is consistent with an expectation from equipartition : in equipartition ( @xmath20 ) and for the same reference value of @xmath21 , we expect @xmath18 g for young sne ( @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath9 ) and @xmath19 g for snrs ( @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) . at 10 ghz typical of _ cm _ wavelengths , electrons energy responsible to the emission",
    "is @xmath27 in sne iib / ib / ic and @xmath28 in snrs .",
    "following the above estimate , it is clear that the electrons emitting in _ cm _ wavelengths are totally in different energy regimes in young sne and snrs .",
    "the electrons energy responsible for the radio emission is certainly much above the dsa requirement for snrs , so they are likely efficiently accelerated . on the other hand ,",
    "the radio - emitting electrons in young sne unlikely satisfy the efficient dsa condition , i.e. , the electrons do not feel the shock wave as infinitesimal discontinuity .",
    "we suggest this is a reason why different intrinsic slopes are obtained for young sne and snrs .",
    "this interpretation offers a unique opportunity to study the electron acceleration mechanism , or the injection problem , through the sn - csm interaction signals from young sne .",
    "our scenario predicts that the flattening of the intrinsic electron spectrum should take place above the energy currently probed in",
    "_ cm _ wavelengths .",
    "we propose two methods to further probe this issue using currently operating observatories : ( 1 ) _ mm _ observations ( e.g. , _ alma _ ) and ( 2 ) x - ray observations ( e.g. , _ chandra _ ) .",
    "at 100 ghz , the corresponding lorentz factor of the synchrotron emitting electrons is @xmath29 for @xmath18 g , which is the energy range in which the flattening could already happen announcing the possible transition from inefficient to efficient electron acceleration (  2 ) .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show an example of expected multi - band light curves in the _ alma _ bands , and the predicted spectral evolution for the same models . the model has been constructed through standard formalisms @xcite , and fits well to the multi band radio light curves of nearby sn iib 2011dh in @xmath30 ghz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the model details ) . here",
    ", we include the effect of the spectral flattening ( at @xmath31 ) , while fixing all the other parameters as calibrated for sn 2011dh .",
    "we fix @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and @xmath4 below and above @xmath31 .",
    "the inclusion of the spectral flattening does not affect the properties in _ cm _ wavelengths .",
    "this model is shown in the figure as ` ciib / ib / ic ' .",
    "we assume a steady - state wind for the csm density as @xmath34 g @xmath23 ( @xmath35 is the distance from the progenitor in _ cm _ ) , and we adopt @xmath36 for sn iib 2011dh @xcite .",
    "the stripped - envelope sne ( iib / ib / ic ) are characterized by the absence / weakness of lines from particular elements in the optical maximum - light spectra @xcite : weak h lines in sne iib , ( generally ) absence of h lines in sne ib , and neither h nor he in sne ic . the origin of this difference is generally interpreted as a different amount of envelope stripped off during the hydrostatic evolutionary phase @xcite .",
    "sne iib are ( sometimes ) further sub - divided into sne eiib ( ` extended ' ) and sne ciib ( ` compact ' ) @xcite .",
    "sne eiib , ciib , ib / ic are then linked to the different size of the progenitor envelope , where sne eiib are believed to come from a red supergiant ( rsg ) while sne ib / c are from a compact wolf - rayet ( wr ) @xcite .",
    "their different properties in radio wavelengths can be interpreted as mainly controlled by different csm density rather than the sn properties @xcite , where the csm is as dense as @xmath37 for sne eiib @xcite , while it is less dense in sne ciib / ib / ic ( @xmath38 ) @xcite . to take into account this variation",
    ", we also investigate sne with more dense csm , named ` eiib ' ( @xmath39 ) and a transitional case ` ciib - eiib ' ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "note that even with @xmath39 , the free - free absorption is estimated to be negligible at @xmath41 ghz unlike in the _ cm _ wavelengths @xcite , highlighting another useful nature of the high frequency observation ",
    "the transparency even for sne within moderately high - density environments ( e.g. , sne eiib , iip ) .",
    "the spectral flattening in the electron energy distribution results in the flattening in the synchrotron spectrum . in light curves",
    "this is seen as a flattening in the decay rate , which takes place first in the higher frequency then eventually in the lower frequency . for denser csm",
    "the transition is further delayed and the large luminosity is attained due to the higher magnetic field content and higher relativistic electron density for denser csm .    the model curves are compared to the @xmath42 detection limit in the continuum observation mode of _ alma _ with one - hour exposure in each band @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows that _ alma _ can detect the synchrotron signal from nearby sne , and that the possible spectral fattening can be investigated . if @xmath43 as in our reference value (  2 ) , this will be clearly identified in @xmath44 ghz . for the cycle-1",
    "_ alma _ and an exposure of one hour , this is reachable for typical sne ciib / ib / ic up to @xmath45 mpc , and to @xmath46 mpc or even more for sne eiib and the intermediate case . for the larger value of @xmath31 , the beginning of this light curve flattening",
    "is delayed at the lower flux level .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the synthesized spectrum as a function of time , for @xmath32 .",
    "the spectral break frequency ( corresponding to @xmath31 ) moves toward the lower frequency as time goes by .",
    "the break appears within the _ alma _ bands at @xmath47 day , and later enters into the lower frequency bands .",
    "thus , the multi - epoch follow - up is crucial , and coordinated follow up in _ cm _ wavelengths is strongly encouraged .    in these models ,",
    "the synchrotron cooling is the dominant process in the energy range of interest here @xcite .",
    "the cooling frequency evolves toward the higher energy . for the ` ciib ' model ,",
    "initially it is below the _ alma _ bands , and later moves into the _ alma _ bands and even to the higher energy .",
    "this evolution is in the opposite direction to the one caused by the intrinsic spectral flattening , thus these two effects are distinguishable .",
    "it will give an independent estimate of the magnetic field strength through the relation @xmath48 days , providing a rare case to test different scenarios for magnetic field generation / amplification .",
    "another suggestion for the spectral flattening is to look into a late - time x - ray property ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "figure 3 shows an expected x - ray light curve evolution ( @xmath49 at @xmath50 kev ) .",
    "this model assumes an additional low energy relativistic electron population at @xmath51 to account for the x - ray luminosity at @xmath52 day by the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering , together with the power - law synchrotron - emitting electrons at @xmath53 . for the ic ,",
    "we assume that the sn bolometric light curve follows the @xmath54co decay after 100 days .",
    "this would overestimate the ic scattering effect there , so the ic contribution could decreases more quickly than shown in figure 3 after 100 days .",
    "in addition to this reference model , @xcite provided another possibility , where the csm density is as high as @xmath55 and the x - ray is dominated by the free - free emission from the thermal electrons ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . while @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) preferred the low - density solution in view of a connection to other sne ib / c , the early - phase observation of sn 2011dh itself did not discriminate these two possibilities .",
    "the synchrotron contribution is small as compared to other mechanisms if we extrapolate the intrinsic electron energy distribution derived for the radio emitting electrons ( @xmath56 ) to the x - ray synchrotron emitting electrons ( i.e. , without the flattening ) . with the spectral flattening the synchrotron x - ray",
    "is enhanced , and can dominate the free - free emission at @xmath57 days if @xmath43 ( if @xmath36 ) .",
    "it further dominates the ic x - ray at @xmath58 days . on the other hand ,",
    "the free - free always dominates the x - ray emission if the csm density is as high as @xmath59 .",
    "this provides a test for the origin of the x - ray emission from sn 2011dh .",
    "if the early - phase x - ray was due to the high density csm and the free - free emission , then the late - phase x - ray luminosity should stay as luminous as @xmath60 erg s@xmath61 even at a few years after the explosion .",
    "otherwise , it should be below @xmath62 erg s@xmath61 .",
    "the free - free emission follows the temporal evolution of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron x - ray is in the cooling regime , and roughly follows @xmath64 without the flattening @xcite . with the flattening at @xmath32 , the synchrotron x - ray emitting electrons",
    "are above this energy , and thus @xmath65 @xcite .    in case that the early - phase x - ray was dominated by the ic ( which is testable from the late - phase observation as mentioned above )",
    ", it provides an interesting possibility to probe the electron acceleration mechanism @xcite .",
    "if there is the spectral flattening , the synchrotron x - ray emission can dominate in the late - phases , and this effect can be identified by the characteristic relatively flat evolution with nearly a constant luminosity ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "if @xmath32 , this behavior can be detectable by _ chandra _ _ now _ ( fig .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed new approaches to investigate the injection and acceleration problem of relativistic electrons at a strong shock wave . a peculiar feature derived from synchrotron radio emissions ( in _ cm _ wavelengths ) from nearby young sne , especially established for stripped - envelope sne ( iib / ib / ic ) , is the steepness in the intrinsic energy distribution of the radio - emitting relativistic electrons .",
    "we suggest this steep distribution could result from a pre - acceleration mechanism able to energize electrons up to the energy threshold needed to start the dsa , as the _ cm _ emission is produced by electrons whose mean free path is smaller than the shock wave width under the physical conditions realized in young sne .    according to this interpretation , we suggest that the relativistic electron s energy distribution could be flattened toward the high energy .",
    "we provide an estimate about the energy scale of electrons as @xmath41 mev ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) where this could most likely happen .",
    "we suggest that identifying ( or constraining ) this feature can provide an important clue for the still - unresolved electron injection problem , and propose two practically accessible diagnostics on this issue , ( 1 ) _ mm / sub - mm _ observations in the first one year , and ( 2 ) late - time x - ray observations around one year after the explosion or thereafter .",
    "mm / sub - mm _ emission from stripped - envelope sne is detectable up to @xmath46 mpc by _",
    "alma_. the second is applicable up to @xmath45 mpc by _",
    "chandra _ , and currently testable for sn iib 2011dh in m51 .",
    "besides investigating the possible flattening of relativistic electrons distribution , these methods will provide additional information .",
    "mm / sub - mm _ observation can be used to place an independent constraint on the magnetic field strength behind the shock wave .",
    "the late - time x - ray observation is able to distinguish the x - ray production mechanism in the early phase .",
    "also , we emphasize the additional uniqueness of the _ mm / sub - mm _ observation - the transparency even for sne eiib and possibly sne iip within dense csm . by combining the _ cm _ and _ mm _ observations ,",
    "both optically thick and thin emissions can be traced to derive physical quantities behind the shock wave ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also note that this transparency increases the applicability of the method to study the shock breakout using the early - phase synchrotron emission @xcite , to sne with more dense csm than in _",
    "our model prediction is based on the model which explains the _ cm _ emission from nearby sn ciib 2011dh @xcite .",
