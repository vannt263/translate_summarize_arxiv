    "in the last decade many papers were devoted to calculations of the low energy properties of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , @xcite .",
    "the main tool to obtain the low - energy expansion of matrix elements is effective field theories based on spontaneous symmetry breaking , such as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) or heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) .",
    "investigation of the chiral structure of a hadron is an important task . only in this way",
    "one can obtain the quark mass dependence and the momentum transfer dependence for gpds in a model - independent way .",
    "investigation of the chiral expansion gives us the behavior of a parton distribution at large impact parameters , where it is governed by pion cloud , see .",
    "e.g. @xcite . while the pion parton distributions were examined comprehensively , the nucleon gpds were considered only as mellin moments .",
    "this article is devoted to the exploration of the chiral corrections to the nucleon gpds in the @xmath2-space ( @xmath2 is the longitudinal hadron momentum fraction carried by a parton ) .",
    "there is a principal difference between the chiral expansions of a parton distribution @xmath3 in @xmath2-space and its mellin moments @xmath4 .",
    "the point is that the mellin transformation does not preserve the chiral order of expansion .",
    "let us dwell on it .",
    "the expressions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 are connected unambiguously via forward and inverse mellin transformations @xmath5    using an effective field theory one gets the first terms of the gradient expansion of mellin moments : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8gev is the character scale of the chiral expansion ) . the remainder of expansion is of order @xmath9 : @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider the function @xmath11 , which is a result of the inverse mellin transform for @xmath12 .",
    "the general statement is that the deviation @xmath13 is not necessarily @xmath14 .",
    "the order of the function @xmath15 depends on @xmath2 and can not be guessed without investigation of the analytical property of the full function @xmath3 .    in the case of qcd",
    "perturbative expansion , the deviation @xmath15 is known to be of the same order as a reminder everywhere except very small @xmath2 . for the gradient expansion the situation is more sharp , because the variable @xmath2 is of kinematic origin and expansion over kinematic parameter can significantly change the analytic properties of a parton distribution .",
    "it is clear that the order of deviation @xmath15 increases with the decreasing of @xmath2 .",
    "it follows from the fact that singularities of @xmath3 are concentrated in the region @xmath16 and for large @xmath2 they are shadowed by the singularity at @xmath17 .",
    "indeed the analysis of the pion parton distribution in the chpt @xcite shows that the deviation @xmath15 is @xmath14 for @xmath18 , but became @xmath19 at @xmath20 . in order to reach the declared accuracy @xmath14 at @xmath20 , the contribution of particular class of diagrams should be added .",
    "the calculation of the low-@xmath2 contribution to the pion gpd was performed with the help of recursive equation technic @xcite , and leads to evident effects @xcite . for the nucleon target such",
    "an analysis was never done .",
    "the starting point of the analysis is the operator definition of gpd .",
    "gpds are defined as matrix elements of the light - cone qcd operator .",
    "the light - cone separation @xmath21 is dimensional , and hence has its own counting rule in the chiral expansion .",
    "contribution of some particular region of @xmath21-integration is distinct for different @xmath2 .",
    "this allows one to correlate @xmath21-counting rules with an appropriate @xmath2-region of gpd . in the mellin moments one integrates over all range of @xmath2 and",
    "therefore mixes up distinct @xmath21-counting rules . in order to resolve",
    "this ambiguity , it is convenient to transfer the counting prescription of @xmath21 onto some other object , which is not washed out during mellin transformation .",
    "the natural object is the vector of light cone direction @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) : first of all , it accompanies the parameter @xmath21 in the gpd operator , second , the normalization of the vector @xmath24 can be changed without changing of gpd definition : @xmath25 therefore , adjusting the special counting rules for the vector @xmath24(@xmath26 ) one obtains the expression for @xmath12 such that @xmath27 in the corresponded area of @xmath2 .",
    "the detailed analysis of the counting rules for vector @xmath24 in different regions of @xmath2 is presented in the sec.ii .",
    "notice , that applying the special counting rules for vector @xmath24 the contributions of the operators with higher number of derivatives to mellin moments can be allowed , contrary the standard counting rules .",
    "then the expression for @xmath12 is not truncated by @xmath28 term , but can contain terms with higher orders of @xmath28 .",
    "this exceedance of the accuracy is needed for the restoration of the proper analytic properties of the distribution .",
    "it also shows that the calculation directly with nonlocal operators looks preferably . in the later case",
    "one should not care on the special counting rules because the parameter @xmath21 is not integrated out , and its size can be directly taken into account .",
    "the price is the incorporation of the nonlocal operator in the gradient expansion .",
    "additional difficulty arises from to the power counting problem of the pion - nucleon chpt .",
    "the standard tool to avoid the counting problem is to use hbchpt , which is a non - relativistic limit of chpt .",
    "however , naive attempt to consider a light - cone operator in the non - relativistic framework is condemned to fail .",
    "the infrared logarithms of straightforward hbchpt are replaced by some cumbersome functions , which often have artificial singularities in @xmath2 .",
    "the reason is the non - commutativity of the non - relativistic limit and the infinite momentum frame nature of the light - cone operator .",
    "therefore , one should consider the nonlocal operator in the covariant framework with consequent procedure of the redefinition of the higher terms by large - mass corrections @xcite .",
    "we notice that the heavy baryon reduction via the infrared regulation @xcite , does not suite here as well , because the loop - integrals with nonlocal operator have infrared properties distinct from the properties of usual loop - integral .",
    "we describe the non - contradictory heavy baryon reduction for loop - integral with nonlocal operators in sec .",
    "iii .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the leading non - analytical chiral correction to nucleon gpds at @xmath0 directly from nonlocal operators in the relativistic covariant framework using extended on - mass - shell subtruction scheme , eoms @xcite .",
    "the structure of the article is following : in sec.ii we derive the effective nonlocal operators and show the difference between our operator and the operators constructed in hbchpt . in sec .",
    "iii we perform the detailed investigation of the heavy baryon limit for the nonlocal operators , and derive rules for self - consistent nonlocal operator consideration within chpt .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented in sec.iv .",
    "calculations with lagrangian ( [ complete_l ] ) lead to the power - counting problem , since the nucleon mass is of the same order as the normalization scale of chpt , @xmath41 gev .",
    "the most popular solution of the counting problem is provided by hbchpt @xcite .",
    "the nucleon field is split onto soft and hard components : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the nucleon velocity vector , @xmath44 .",
    "one eliminates the component @xmath45 using the equations of motion and obtains hbchpt lagrangian .",
    "the pion - nucleon part of hbchpt lagrangian reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the spin operator , @xmath48 .      in the limit @xmath53 , the parameter @xmath54 . in this article we put @xmath55 to zero , by setting @xmath56 .",
    "the effects related to non - zero @xmath55 can be of the leading order in @xmath57 expansion , and they will be considered in a separate article . in the limit @xmath58",
    "the gpds are @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) with transverse momentum dependance .",
    "gpd @xmath62 can not be obtain in the limit @xmath56 .      in this subsection",
    "we construct the effective vector and axial light - cone operators for the nucleon .",
    "our procedure is very close to one presented in @xcite with minor redefinitions .",
    "the procedure of the matching qcd light - cone operators to the operators in the chiral effective theories is well - known .",
    "one should introduce the nonlocal operator with light - cone separation @xmath21 and transformation properties of the initial operator .",
    "we start with qcd operators : @xmath63 these operators transform in mixed representation of the chiral rotations group .",
    "it is convenient to deal with the left- and right - handed light - cone operators : @xmath64 which transform as the define representation .",
    "the fields involved in the chiral lagrangian transforms under local @xmath65 as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are matrices of right and left chiral rotations , and @xmath69 is a matrix of chiral transformations for nucleon field containing field @xmath31 .",
    "the lowest order operators contain no derivatives .",
    "the most general structures respecting the symmetries are : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the integration area over @xmath73 and @xmath74 is @xmath75 , these limits are provided by additional requirement of polynomiality . the functions @xmath76 represent generation functions for the tower of low energy constants , and have the meaning of the double distributions for the nucleon gpds with given isospin number in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "the properties of operators ( [ o],[o5 ] ) under parity transformations demand that @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the expression for vector and axial light - cone operators are @xmath79 where the scalar and pseudo - scalar combinations of pion fields are @xmath80    in expressions ( [ o_in_chpt],[a_in_chpt ] ) one has freedom to choose the normalization of the generating function in a convenient way . to recover that the @xmath81 are the double distributions in the chiral order one should calculate the matrix element @xmath82 at the tree level , and compare the result with definition ( [ v_qcd ] ) .",
    "we obtain : @xmath83 where the symbol @xmath84 denotes the chiral limit of a quantity . the similar consideration for function @xmath85",
    "gives : @xmath86 in the limit @xmath0 , which is of the special interest in this paper , the @xmath73-dependence of the operators can be moved out by the translation .",
    "the resulting generating functions are @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the nucleon pdfs in the chiral limit .",
    "the normalization of the pdfs follows from the vector and axial current operators , it reads : @xmath90    the reduction of the operators ( [ o_in_chpt],[a_in_chpt ] ) to the heavy - baryon form is straightforward : @xmath91 @xmath92    we remind that in hbchpt nucleons are taken to be non - relativistic , and nucleon momenta which flow through the diagrams are reduced momenta : @xmath93 .",
    "the expressions for operators ( [ o_in_hbchpt],[a_in_hbchpt ] ) have the exponential factor @xmath94 , which restores the reduced nucleon momentum to the complete nucleon momentum in the operator vertex .",
    "in principal , this factor can be absorbed to the definition of the low - energy generating functions @xmath81 , but this would lead to the inconvenient scale of parameters @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "we keep the exponential factors as they are , in order to have the simple interpretation ( [ f_interpretation0]-[f - normalization ] ) for the generating functions .",
    "the matrix element of operators ( [ o_in_chpt]-[a_in_chpt ] ) contributes to the gpds @xmath95 and @xmath96 at the tree order , and to all set of gpds at one - loop order .",
    "the leading contribution to the gpds @xmath97 and @xmath62 is given by the operators of the higher order in chiral counting .",
    "the operator giving a chiral limit of gpd @xmath97 is proportional to @xmath98 , and it does not give a contribution to @xmath95 and @xmath96 at tree and one - loop level .",
    "therefore , in this article , which is mostly devoted to gpds @xmath95 and @xmath96 we leave such kind of operators out .",
    "pure pion nonlocal operators respecting the transformation properties of ( [ o],[o5 ] ) can be constructed .",
    "their form and properties were derived at @xcite .",
    "the pure pion operators for the vector and axial pdfs have the form : @xmath99},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath100},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integration area for @xmath73 and @xmath74 is @xmath75 , and @xmath101 .",
    "the axial pion operator gives no contribution at @xmath56 ( up to one - loop level ) , and therefore , we will skip it in current consideration .",
    "the low - energy generation function @xmath102 belongs to the pion gpd in the chiral limit via the expressions : @xmath103},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 stands for the isospin , and @xmath105 . for the forward limit of the pion pdf we will use the notation @xmath106 .",
    "the normalization of pion pdfs is : @xmath107      the mellin moments of gpds are widely used in phenomenology .",
    "the operator of the mellin moment can be found using the well - known relation : @xmath108 calculation of the mellin moments in effective field theory is straightforward and was performed in @xcite up to second chiral order .",
    "the result of calculation has the form : @xmath109 where @xmath28 is the chiral expansion parameter , @xmath110 .",
    "the reminder term of the expansion is @xmath111 .",
    "however , the function @xmath112 ( here , @xmath3 is the full parton distribution and @xmath11 is the reconstructed from @xmath12 parton distribution ) is not necessarily @xmath14 in the full domain of @xmath2 .",
    "the main reason for non - commutation of the perturbative expansion and the mellin transformation is the violation of the analytical properties of @xmath3 by the chiral expansion .",
    "there are no doubts , that the low - energy expansion changes the analytical structure of the parton distributions , and the inverse mellin transformation of the low - energy expansion has different significance in different regions of @xmath2 .",
    "the left - hand - side of equation ( [ op<>m_qcd ] ) contains the dimensional parameter @xmath21 , which has its own chiral counting .",
    "the different areas of @xmath21 are responsible for the physical content of the different regions of @xmath2 . performing mellin transformation",
    "one integrates over all range of @xmath2 and therefore mixes up various counting rules for @xmath21 . in order to resolve this ambiguity , it is convenient to refer the counting prescription of @xmath21 to the light - cone vector @xmath22",
    ". this can be done via changing the normalization factor @xmath113 of the vector @xmath24 in eqn.([norm_n ] ) .",
    "adjusting special counting rule to the vector @xmath24 we obtain the expression for @xmath12 such that @xmath114 in the corresponding area of @xmath2 .",
    "general form of @xmath11 reads : @xmath115 where the function @xmath116 can not be expanded in @xmath28 without distraction of the analytical structure . as it will be demonstrated later , often the mellin convolution in ( [ q_form ] ) is well - behaved in total , but it is divergent for every term of taylor expansion of @xmath116 at @xmath117 . performing mellin transformation of ( [ q_form ] ) one gets : @xmath118 where @xmath119 can be further expanded over @xmath28 .",
    "the term @xmath120 is equal to @xmath121 and , therefore , the expression ( [ demonstration of m ] ) coincides with the expression ( [ m_form ] ) at order @xmath14 .",
    "the exceedance of the accuracy in ( [ demonstration of m ] ) is needed for the restoration of the proper analytic properties of the distribution @xmath11 .",
    "we start the consideration of the counting rules for @xmath21 from the analysis of the standard counting rules of hbchpt , where the light - cone vector @xmath22 has no special prescription .",
    "the standard counting rules of hbchpt reads : @xmath122 where @xmath60 is the parameter of gradient expansion , i.e. small momenta or the pion mass , @xmath123 . in the hbchpt",
    "nonlocal nucleon operators also contain the exponent with the heavy nucleon mass , which suppresses soft derivatives .",
    "therefore , in the leading order the hbchpt operator ( [ o_in_hbchpt ] ) reads : @xmath124 taking into account that @xmath125 and ( [ f - interpretation ] ) we found @xmath126 operator ( [ o_in_(25 ) ] ) allows one to obtain only such corrections to pdf those do not touch the intrinsic dynamics of the nucleon .",
    "in other words using rules ( [ standard_counting_rules ] ) one indirectly uses the approximation @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the form - factor with corresponding quantum numbers .",
    "the standard counting rule @xmath129 relates to the region of @xmath2 close to unity .",
    "that is , at @xmath130 the reconstructed parton distribution @xmath11 deviates as @xmath14 from the full one . in this region the short @xmath21 ( @xmath131 )",
    "dominates in the integral ( [ op<>m_qcd ] ) . in the region",
    "@xmath132 we need to set the condition @xmath133 ( this follows from the condition that the argument of the exponent should be of order unity , otherwise integral is suppressed ) . as a result",
    "one has the following counting rules : @xmath134 and similar for the nucleon field .",
    "also the consistent counting rules should be attached to the vector @xmath43 @xmath135 in this case all light - cone derivatives are of the same importance .",
    "the operators for mellin moments can be obtained directly by the expansion of the operators ( [ o_in_hbchpt],[a_in_hbchpt ] ) .",
    "numerically this area corresponds to @xmath136 . in this region",
    "the loops with composite operators should be calculated with a great care , because usually ultraviolet logarithms of @xmath137 can become infrared . and , indeed , such effects take a place and we discuss them in the next section .",
    "the region @xmath138 is governed by the higher derivative terms since @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the integral ( [ op<>m_qcd ] ) is controlled by the huge light - cone distance @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , the higher terms of the chiral expansion are of the same importance as the leading order and should be taken into account simultaneously .",
    "the terms belonging to this region have the form of @xmath142-functions and their derivatives , see the case of pion @xcite .",
    "the resummation of such series in all orders of chiral expansion leads to the leading term , which describes the long - range behavior of the pion cloud .",
    "this mechanism is also known as the `` chiral inflation '' , see @xcite .",
    "we stress , that many problems with intermediate regions can be avoided performing calculation directly with nonlocal operators . keeping the parameter @xmath21 alive",
    "one leaves the decision of the interesting @xmath2-region until the final result . as a price one has to perform more involved calculation .",
    "there are five diagrams contributing to the leading order of pdf chiral expansion , fig.1 .",
    "the calculation of these diagrams is almost straightforward .",
    "however , the final result contains some uncertainties , related to non - commutativity of the heavy baryon limit and light - cone definition of the operator , which we discuss in this section .    to show features of the calculation with nonlocal operators in heavy baryon theories we consider in details the diagram b. for concreteness",
    ", we consider the vector isovector operator .",
    "the diagram b is interesting because it mixes the axial and the vector pdfs with each other .",
    "such a mixing is believed to be strongly suppressed , because the mellin moments of this diagram are zero at leading order , due to convolution of the nucleon spin - vector with the nucleon velocity . whereas the calculation with nonlocal operator gives non - zero result already at the leading order .",

    "this part is proportional to the large mass and can not be considered as a correction without additional adaptation .",
    "the standard approach of the heavy baryon theory posses the rescaling of the nucleon fields ( [ field_rescaling ] ) and afterwards expansion in the small ratio @xmath150 . in the language of the feynman diagrams it means a partial resummation of the perturbative expansion and",
    "it was never done explicitly . the bypass way was suggested in @xcite : the heavy baryon result is provided by the infrared singular part of the loop - integral , whereas the infrared regular part is to be subtracted into the higher order coupling constants .",
    "this method works perfectly for usual loop - integrals , but faces problems with loop - integrals of type ( [ b1 ] ) . applying formally the method of @xcite to the integral ( [ b1 ] ) one gets :",

    "the reason is that the @xmath142-function of the nonlocal operator changes the low - energy behavior of the loop - integral and does not allow to reach the infrared pole at @xmath153 .",
    "also expression ( [ b[17 ] ] ) contains incorrect @xmath154-function , which results to the singular integral over @xmath74 .",
    "the integration over @xmath2 for expression ( [ b[17 ] ] ) is infrared divergent , due to the incorrect @xmath154-function .",
    "this reproduces the infrared singular part for the loop - integrals for the mellin moments .",
    "the proper way to reduce the integral ( [ b11 ] ) to the heavy baryon limit is not to extract the infrared singular part of the loop - integral , but to subtract its infrared regular part .",
    "the regular part of the loop integral is not changed by the nonlocality , because at the limit @xmath58 the delta - function can be moved out of the loop - integral . therefore , the reduction to the heavy baryon limit for nonlocal operators consists in the subtraction of the pole at @xmath58 , with the subsequent renormalization procedure .",

    "reads : @xmath155}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression is @xmath156 , in spite of the large mass @xmath32 in the second term .",
    "the expression ( [ b5 ] ) has a general form ( [ q_form ] ) .",
    "expanding the logarithm in the second term in powers of @xmath73 one get the asymptotic series , because every term starting from @xmath157 is divergent at @xmath158 integral due to the factor @xmath159 .",
    "this is a bright example of the non - commutativity of the large mass limit with the light - cone formulation of the nucleon structure operators .",
    "the mellin moment of the expression ( [ b5 ] ) reads : @xmath160 where @xmath161 @xmath162 the leading term of the expansion for @xmath163 in powers of @xmath73 vanishes due to cancelation of integrals over logarithm and delta - function .",
    "therefore , the non - analytical part mellin moment of the mixing parity term is @xmath164 this result coincides with the results of @xcite .",
    "the analytical part of the diagram is of order @xmath156 and accompanied by the leading contribution of higher chiral order operator .",

    "the fact that corrections change their chiral order with @xmath2 is a character feature of the pure pion sector .",
    "similar terms in nucleon - pion sector ( [ c0]-[dc1 ] ) do not change the order of correction with the changing of @xmath2 .",
    "also we are drawing attention to the @xmath142-function contributions in expressions ( [ qend-1],[qend ] ) .",
    "these contributions have the special nature , because at @xmath195 they are formally of the same order as the tree term . together with similar contributions from the higher orders of chiral expansion they form the leading chiral correction to the nucleon pdf in the region @xmath197 .",
    "the operator evidence of the these terms was presented in sec.2.2 .",
    "the resummation of the @xmath142-function contributions in all orders of chpt is an important task .",

    "the mellin moments of our calculations coincides with the known results .",
    "however , our analysis shows that the mellin moments calculated within standard hbchpt approach can be used for reconstruction of the original parton distribution only in the region @xmath130 , and fails to restore the distribution already at @xmath198 .",
    "our results can be used for investigation of the distributions down to @xmath199 .",
    "we found that the derived corrections give the visible contribution of order @xmath200 .",
    "we have shown that there exist a parity - mixing term , which mixes vector and axial pdfs .",
    "the mixing contribution is of order @xmath9 , which can not be deduced from consideration of the mellin moments . because of uncertainties in the inverse mellin transformation the mixing terms were believed to be of order @xmath201 , which two orders of magnitude less .",
    "the pion contributions to the vector gpd contain the term proportional to @xmath202 , which is a bright sign of necessity to sum up such terms in all orders of the chiral expansion .",
    "they must be resummed at @xmath195 , since all @xmath142-terms are of the same order as the leading term .",
    "the resummation can be done in the leading logarithmical order with the help of the recursive equations @xcite .",
    "the result gives the leading asymptotic term in the long distance behavior of nucleon gpds , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "the slope of pdfs is related to the average impact parameter squared as @xmath203 we have found , that the contribution of the pion sector of pdfs given by ( [ qend-1]-[qend],[sp ] ) is larger in magnitude then the contribution of the nucleon sector ( [ c0]-[tildac1],[sn ] ) for @xmath204 , which is in a good agreement with general chiral picture of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "for example , average squared impact parameter @xmath205 for the vector isovector parton distribution @xmath206 is : @xmath207 where the first term comes from nucleon contribution @xmath208 , whereas the second term comes from the pion contribution @xmath209 .",
    "the important in phenomenology case of non - zero @xmath210 , as well as complete calculation of gpds @xmath97 and @xmath62 , also can be considered in the presented framework and will be covered in further publication .",
    "we would like to thank m.polyakov , n.kivel and g.gegelia for numerous stimulating discussions and real interest to our work .",
    "also we thank p.wein for comments .",
    "this work is supported by bmbf grant 06bo9012 .",
    "in this appendix we present the listing of the diagram contributions , in @xmath2-representation and their mellin moments at the leading logarithmical order .",
    "the diagrams are shown in fig.1 . to obtain the results ( [ q0]-[qend ] ) the renormalization of the nucleon field should be added .",
    "diagrams @xmath211 corresponding to the matrix element ( [ v_qcd ] ) can be presented as the following convolution : @xmath212}u(p),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath213 and @xmath214 belong to the nucleon parton distributions @xmath169 and @xmath171 , respectively .",
    "the vector pdf @xmath215 should be replaced by the axial pdf @xmath216 for the diagram @xmath217 , and by the pion pdf @xmath218 for the diagrams @xmath219 and @xmath97 .",
    "three diagrams @xmath225 contributing to the axial matrix element ( [ a_qcd ] ) will be presented in a similar convolution : @xmath226 where @xmath227 belongs to the nucleon parton distribution @xmath170 .",
    "the axial pdf @xmath216 should be replaced by the vector pdf @xmath215 for the diagram @xmath217 .",
    "@xmath228    below we present non - analytic contributions to mellin moments of @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath187 nucleon parton distributions at order @xmath156 in the chiral expansion .",
    "we define mellin transformation of the functions @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 as @xmath232 and give a list of their moments diagram - by - diagram : @xmath233 @xmath234 @xmath235 functions @xmath236 and @xmath237 for zeroth mellin moment diagram - by - diagram reproduce results of @xcite for the vector and axial form factors .",
