    "although demand assignment multiple access ( dama ) medium access control ( mac ) protocols guarantee an efficient usage of the available bandwidth @xcite , mac random access schemes remain an appealing and popular solution for wireless networks . among them , slotted aloha ( sa ) @xcite is currently adopted as the initial access scheme in both cellular terrestrial and satellite communication networks @xcite . in @xcite an improvement to sa was proposed , namely , diversity slotted aloha ( dsa ) . in dsa , each packet ( also called _ burst _ ) is transmitted twice over the mac frame , which provides a slight throughput gain over sa . as a drawback , for the same peak transmission power of the sa scheme , the average transmitted power of dsa is doubled .",
    "a more effective use of the burst repetition is provided by contention resolution diversity slotted aloha ( crdsa ) @xcite , whose basic idea is the adoption of interference cancellation ( ic ) to resolve collisions .",
    "more specifically , with respect to dsa , each of the twin replicas of a burst , transmitted within a mac frame , possesses a pointer to the slot position where the respective copy was sent . whenever a clean burst is detected and successfully decoded , the pointer is extracted and the interference contribution caused by the burst copy on the corresponding slot is removed .",
    "this procedure is iterated , possibly allowing to recover the whole set of bursts transmitted within the same mac frame .",
    "this results in a remarkably improved normalized throughput @xmath1 ( defined as the probability of successful packet transmission per time slot ) which may reach @xmath2 , whereas the peak throughput for pure sa is @xmath3 .",
    "further improvements can be achieved by exploiting the capture effect @xcite .    in @xcite irregular repetition slotted aloha ( irsa )",
    "was introduced to provide a further throughput gain over crdsa .",
    "a higher normalized throughput is achieved by irsa by allowing a variable and judiciously designed repetition rate for each burst . as for dsa",
    ", the performance improvement achieved by crdsa / irsa has a counterpart in the increment of the average transmitted power . since crdsa is a specific instance of irsa , in the following we will refer in general to irsa . in @xcite",
    "it is also illustrated how the iterative burst recovery process on the receiver side can be represented via a bipartite graph and how , under the assumption of an ideal channel estimation and of a sufficiently large signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , it shares several commonalities with the graph representation of the erasure recovery process of modern channel codes on sparse graphs @xcite .    in this paper , we introduce a further generalization of irsa , named _ coded slotted aloha _",
    "the basic idea of csa is to encode ( instead of simply repeat ) bursts using local codes prior to transmission in the mac frame and to combine , on the receiver side , iterative ic with decoding of the local codes to recover from collisions .",
    "the new scheme turns out to be interesting especially in contexts where power efficiency is required .",
    "density evolution equations for csa are derived to analyze the ic process in an asymptotic setting , leading to the calculation of the peak asymptotic throughput .",
    "numerical results are then presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed asymptotic analysis and its effectiveness in the design of csa access schemes for a finite number of users .",
    "similarly to @xcite , we consider a random access scheme where the slots are grouped in mac frames , all with the same length ( in slots ) .",
    "we further restrict to the case where each user attempts one burst transmission per mac frame .",
    "consider @xmath4 users , each attempting the transmission of a burst of time duration @xmath5 over a mac frame of time duration @xmath6 .",
    "neglecting guard times , the mac frame is composed of @xmath7 slots . in sa , each user would independently choose one of the @xmath8 slots uniformly at random and would attempt transmission of his burst into that slot . in irsa each user would generate a certain number @xmath9 of replicas of his burst , where @xmath9 may be not the same for two different users , and would transmit the @xmath9 replicas into @xmath9 slots chosen uniformly at random among the available @xmath8 slots .    in csa , when a user wishes to transmit a burst of time duration @xmath5 over the mac frame , the burst is divided into @xmath10 information sub - bursts ( also called information _ segments _ ) , each of time duration @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath10 information segments are then encoded by the user via a packet - oriented binary linear block code which generates @xmath12 encoded segments , each of time duration @xmath11 . for each transmission , the code to be employed",
    "is drawn randomly by the user from a set of @xmath13 possible codes .",
    "for @xmath14 the @xmath15th code , denoted by @xmath16 , is a @xmath17 code , that is it has length @xmath12 , dimension @xmath10 , and minimum distance @xmath18 .",
    "we further impose that @xmath16 has no idle bits and fulfills @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that , at any transmission , each user independently chooses his local code according to a probability mass function ( p.m.f . ) @xmath20@xmath21_{h=1}^{n_c}$ ] which is the same for all users . denoting again by @xmath6 the mac frame duration ,",
    "the mac frame is composed of @xmath22 slots .",
    "the @xmath12 coded segments are then transmitted by the user over @xmath12 slots picked uniformly at random .",
    "note that irsa may be seen as a special case of csa where @xmath23 and each @xmath16 is a repetition code of length @xmath12 , and that sa is a special case of irsa where @xmath24 for all users .",
    "the overall _ rate _ of csa is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the expected length of the code employed by the generic user .",
    "note that @xmath27 represents the increment of average power with respect to pure  sa .",
    "it is now convenient to introduce a graph representation of csa , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : csa_graph ] .",
    "let us consider a mac frame composed of @xmath28 slots , in which @xmath4 users attempt a transmission .",
    "the mac frame status can be represented by a bipartite graph , @xmath29 , consisting of a set @xmath30 of @xmath4 _ burst nodes _ ( one for each burst transmitted in the mac frame ) , a set @xmath31 of @xmath28 _ sum nodes _",
    "( one for each slot ) , and a set @xmath32 of edges .",
    "an edge connects a burst node ( bn ) @xmath33 to a sum node ( sn ) @xmath34 if and only if an encoded segment associated with the @xmath35th burst is transmitted in the @xmath36th slot . in other words , bns correspond to bursts , sns to slots , and edges to encoded segments .",
    "therefore , a burst split into @xmath10 information segments and encoded via the code @xmath16 is represented as a bn with @xmath12 neighbors .",
    "correspondingly , a slot where @xmath37 replicas collide is represented as a sn with @xmath37 connections .",
    "the number of edges emanating from a node is the node degree .",
    "moreover , a bn where @xmath16 is employed during the current transmission is referred to as a bn of type  @xmath15 .",
    "[ c ] [ c ]     users , squares are the sum nodes and represent the @xmath38 slots .",
    "the degree of a burst node is equal to the length of the locally employed code .",
    "the degree of a sum node is equal to the number of collided encoded segments .",
    "the example is for @xmath39 . ]    in our analysis , we rely on three assumptions .",
    "1 ) _ sufficiently high snr_. this allows to claim that , when a segment is received in a clean slot , it is known at the receiver .",
    "2 ) _ ideal channel estimation_. under this assumption ( and the previous one ) , ideal ic is possible , allowing the recovery of collided bursts with a probability that is essentially one .",
    "3 ) _ destructive collisions_. segments that collide in a slot are treated as erasures .",
    "these assumptions simplify the analysis without substantially affecting the obtained results , as shown in @xcite and @xcite for crdsa and irsa , respectively .    each coded segment associated with a bn of type @xmath15",
    "is equipped with information about the relevant user and with a pointer to the other @xmath40 segments .",
    ", one may include in the segment header the code index @xmath15 together with a random seed , out of which it is possible to reconstruct ( by a pre - defined pseudo - random number generator ) the positions of the @xmath12 segments .",
    "] on the receiver side , segments which collided in some slot with those sent by another user are marked as lost , so that a bn is connected to `` known '' edges and to `` unknown '' ones .",
    "hence , some of its information bursts are known , and the others unknown . at the generic bn ( say of type @xmath15 ) ,",
    "erasure decoding of the code @xmath16 may allow to recover some of the unknown encoded and information segments .",
    "it is now possible to subtract the interference contribution of the newly recovered encoded segments from the signal received in the corresponding slot .",
    "if @xmath41 segments that collided in a sn of degree @xmath37 have been recovered by the corresponding bns , the remaining segment becomes known .",
    "the ic process combined with local decoding at the bns proceeds iteratively , i.e. , cleaned segments may allow solving other collisions .",
    "note that this procedure is equivalent to iterative decoding of a doubly - generalized low - density parity - check ( d - gldpc ) code over the erasure channel @xcite , where variable nodes are generic linear block codes and check nodes are single parity - check ( spc ) codes .    denoting by @xmath42 the number of slots ( a multiple of @xmath10 ) ,",
    "the logical normalized offered traffic @xmath43 is given by from the _ physical _ load given by @xmath44 and representing the average number of transmitted segments per slot .",
    "the logical load @xmath43 provides a direct measure of the traffic handled by the scheme .",
    "note that the two concepts coincide in pure sa . ]",
    "@xmath45 the normalized throughput @xmath1 is defined as the probability of successful packet transmission per time slot .",
    "for example , for standard sa we have @xmath46 .    finally , we recall the definition of _ information function _ of a linear block code @xcite .",
    "let @xmath47 be a generator matrix for an @xmath48 linear block code @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50th un - normalized information function of @xmath49 , denoted by @xmath51 , is defined as the summation of the ranks over all the possible submatrices obtained selecting @xmath50 columns ( with @xmath52 ) out of @xmath47 .",
    "the degree distribution of the sns from a node perspective is defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the probability that a sn has degree @xmath37 .",
    "let us consider a user encoding his segments through the code @xmath16 , and allocating his @xmath12 encoded segments into @xmath12 slots chosen randomly .",
    "then , the probability that the bn associated with this user ( say @xmath55 ) is connected to a sn @xmath56 may be expressed as the ratio between the number of ways of connecting the @xmath12 sockets of @xmath55 to the @xmath38 sns such that @xmath55 is connected to @xmath56 , to the total number of ways of connecting the @xmath12 sockets of @xmath55 to the @xmath38 sns : @xmath57 .",

    "<S> in this paper , coded slotted aloha ( csa ) is introduced as a powerful random access scheme to the mac frame . in csa , </S>",
    "<S> the burst a generic user wishes to transmit in the mac frame is first split into segments , and these segments are then encoded through a local a packet - oriented code prior to transmission . on the receiver side , iterative interference cancellation combined with decoding of the local code </S>",
    "<S> is performed to recover from collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the new scheme generalizes the previously proposed irregular repetition slotted aloha ( irsa ) technique , based on a simple repetition of the users bursts . </S>",
    "<S> an interpretation of the csa interference cancellation process as an iterative erasure decoding process over a sparse bipartite graph is identified , and the corresponding density evolution equations derived . </S>",
    "<S> based on these equations , asymptotically optimal csa schemes are designed for several rates and their performance for a finite number of users investigated through simulation and compared to irsa competitors . </S>",
    "<S> throughputs as high as @xmath0 are demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the new scheme turns out to be a good candidate in contexts where power efficiency is required . </S>"
