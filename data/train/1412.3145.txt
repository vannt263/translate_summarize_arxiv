    "a base model of the high - resolution fiber - fed spectrograph for moderate diameter telescopes is developed .",
    "its stationary part ( fig.[fig1 ] ) is performed under the white pupil layout which was proposed by  @xcite .",
    "there were two schemes of the observations : spectropolarimetric and doppler , each only uses two optical fibers . in the spectropolarimetic mode",
    "register simultaneously two spectra with different circular polarization , in the doppler s mode are being registered simultaneously stellar and th - ar lamp spectra .",
    "the comparison spectrum contains bright lines ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) , therefore simultaneous registration of star and lamp spectra will distort both of them .",
    "a special device for removing these distortions because of the bright lines and to regulate the flux from the th - ar lamp was developed .",
    "this device provides parallel and simultaneous registration of spectra of star and th - ar lamp with exposures of reasonable duration .",
    "the control system of the spectrograph is based on the national instruments technology and contains the controller ni compactrio 9073 which includes five modules .",
    "programm code is written within the environment of the graphics programming labview .    in combination with the sao 1m telescope the spectrograph provides the following parameters : spectral resolution r=45000 , the number of simultaneously registered orders is 86 within the spectral region 3850@xmath010850 ( moreover , each echelle order is registered twice ) .",
    "on the ccd 2048@xmath22048 pixels , echelle orders are being overlapped for @xmath1 .",
    "the spectrograph is designed for observations of objects whose regular monitoring at the bta is not possible .",
    "the image of the spectrum of the heavily reddened star ( v=11.7mag , b=14.0mag ) obtained when testing budget version of the spectrograph  @xcite is presented in fig.[fig4 ] ."
