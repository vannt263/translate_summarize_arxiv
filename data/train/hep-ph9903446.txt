    "semileptonic decays of pseudoscalar mesons allow to evaluate the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which are fundamental parameters of the standard model .",
    "the decay @xmath7 provides the most accurate determination of @xmath8 , the semileptonic decays of d and b mesons , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , can be used to determine @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the effects of strong interactions in these processes can be expressed in terms of form factors , which depend on @xmath15 , the squared momentum transferred to the leptonic pair .",
    "information on the form factors are obtained by measuring the distributions of @xmath15 and decay angles .",
    "the decays of heavy d and b mesons are of particular interest due to the spin - flavor symmetry observed for infinite quark masses @xcite . this symmetry allows to reduce the number of form factors and express them in terms of the universal isgur - wise function @xcite . also the scaling laws derived for some physical observables can be , in principle , tested experimentally . since the isgur - wise function can not be calculated from first principles , many models and nonperturbative approaches , which exhibit the heavy quark symmetry , have been employed to describe relevant phenomena .",
    "however , it was found out , that the finite mass corrections are very important , especially , in the charm sector .",
    "it appears that in some sense a step back should be done from using the heavy quark symmetry as a guide under model building to the straightforward calculations with full quark propagators .",
    "then one has to check the consistency of the results with the spin - flavor symmetry in the heavy quark limit .    in this paper",
    "we employ the relativistic constituent quark model ( rcqm ) @xcite for the simultaneous description of both light and heavy flavored meson leptonic and semileptonic decays .",
    "this model is based on the effective lagrangian describing the coupling of mesons with their quark constituents , and the compositeness condition .",
    "the physical processes are described by the one - loop quark diagrams with free constituent propagators and meson - quark vertices related to the bethe - salpeter amplitudes .",
    "the masses of lower - lying pseudoscalar ( ps ) mesons should be less than the sum of quark constituent masses to provide the absence of imaginary parts corresponding to quark production .",
    "the adjustable parameters , the widths of bethe - salpeter amplitudes in momentum space and constituent quark masses , are determined from the best fit of available experimental data and some lattice determinations .",
    "we found that our results are in good agreement with experimental data and other approaches . also we reproduce the results of spin - flavor symmetry for leptonic decay constants and semileptonic form factors in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the shapes of vertex functions and quark propagators should be found from the bethe - salpeter and dyson - schwinger equations , respectively .",
    "this is provided by the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) @xcite studies .",
    "a dse - approach has been employed to provide a unified and uniformly accurate description of light- and heavy - meson observables @xcite .",
    "a similar approach , based on the effective heavy meson lagrangian , has been described in @xcite in terms of a model based on meson - quark interactions , where mesonic transition amplitudes are represented by diagrams with heavy mesons attached to quark loops .",
    "the free propagator has been used for light quarks .",
    "however , the quark propagator obtained in the heavy quark limit has been employed for heavy quarks .",
    "we employ an approach @xcite based on the effective interaction lagrangian which describes the transition of hadron into quarks . for example",

    "the function @xmath22 is related to the scalar part of bethe - salpeter amplitude .",
    "for instance , the separable form @xmath23 has been used in @xcite for pions .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath24 is given by the so called _ compositeness condition _ proposed in @xcite and extensively used in @xcite .",
