    "in the traditional nuclear shell model , the low - energy structure of a nucleus is described by diagonalizing the effective nuclear hamiltonian in an active space consisting of at most a few major shells outside / inside an assumed doubly - magic core . despite the enormous truncation inherent in this approach",
    ", it can still only be applied in very limited nuclear regimes . for heavy nuclei or nuclei",
    "far from closed shells , further truncation of the shell - model space to a manageable size is required .    in this work , we discuss the use of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) as a truncation strategy for the nuclear shell model . originally developed for the treatment of low - dimensional quantum lattices @xcite ,",
    "the dmrg method was subsequently extended with impressive success @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to finite fermi systems , suggesting its possible usefulness for the nuclear shell model .",
    "the dmrg method involves a systematic inclusion of the degrees of freedom of the problem .",
    "when treating quantum lattices , real - space sites are added iteratively . in finite fermi systems ,",
    "these sites are replaced by single - particle levels . at each stage , the group of sites that has been treated ( referred to as a _ block _ ) is enlarged to include an additional site or level . this _",
    "enlarged block _ is then coupled to the rest of the system ( the _ medium _ ) giving rise to the _ superblock_. for a given eigenstate of the superblock ( often the ground state ) or perhaps for a group of important eigenstates , the reduced density matrix of the enlarged block in the presence of the medium is constructed and diagonalized and those states with the largest eigenvalues are retained .",
    "this method of truncation is guaranteed to be optimal in the sense that it maximizes the overlap of the truncated wave function with the superblock wave function prior to truncation .",
    "this process of systematically growing the system and determining the optimal structure within that enlarged block is carried out iteratively , by sweeping back and forth through the sites , at each stage using the results from the previous sweep to define the medium . in this way",
    ", the process iteratively updates the information on each block until convergence from one sweep to the next is achieved .",
    "finally , the calculations are carried out as a function of the number of states retained in each block , until the changes are acceptably small .",
    "the traditional dmrg method works in a product space , whereby the enlarged block is obtained as a product of states in the block and the added site and the superblock is obtained as a product of states in the enlarged block and the medium . in the nuclear context , this means working in the m - scheme .",
    "this method was applied in nuclear physics by papenbrock and dean @xcite and shown to provide an accurate description of the properties of @xmath2 , but a much poorer description of @xmath3 where the converged solution was still energetically quite far from the exact ground state .",
    "a limitation of the traditional algorithm is that it does not preserve symmetries throughout the iterative process .",
    "since the density matrix procedure involves a truncation at each iterative stage , there is the potential to lose these symmetries and the associated correlations . on this basis",
    ", we proposed @xcite the adoption of a strategy in which angular momentum is preserved throughout the dmrg process .",
    "this method , called the jdmrg , was applied in nuclear physics for the first time in the context of the gamow shell model @xcite and then subsequently developed as a means of approximating the traditional nuclear shell model , with a preliminary application first reported @xcite for @xmath4 .",
    "more recently , the algorithm was computationally improved and applied both to @xmath4 and to the ground state of @xmath3 @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to include excited states of @xmath3 .",
    "an outline of the presentation is as follows .",
    "we begin in section ii with a brief overview of the traditional dmrg method including a discussion of the changes required for exact angular - momentum conservation . in section iii , we report our results for @xmath4 , which were first presented in @xcite , and then report our most recent results for @xmath3 , including those for excited states .",
    "finally , in section iv we summarize the principal conclusions of this work and outline some directions for future investigation .",
    "the dmrg method is based on an iterative inclusion of the degrees of freedom of the problem , represented as sites on a lattice .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in figure 1 for a system with @xmath5 _ ordered _ sites .",
    "consisting of sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 is enlarged to include site @xmath8 , forming @xmath9 .",
    "the medium @xmath10 consists of all of the remaining sites , @xmath11 . ]",
    "assume that we have treated a group of sites , referred to as the block and denoted @xmath12 , and that we have retained a total number of ( optimal ) states @xmath13 within that block .",
    "we now wish to add to this block the next site ( @xmath14 ) with @xmath15 states , thereby producing an enlarged block @xmath9 . for the moment",
    ", we will assume a product ( or m - scheme ) description , so that the enlarged block has @xmath16 states , @xmath17 we wish to retain the optimal @xmath13 states for the enlarged block .",
    "how do we choose them ?    in the dmrg method , we consider the enlarged block in the presence of a medium @xmath10 that reflects all of the other sites of the system , referring to the full system as the superblock ( sb ) . assuming that the medium is likewise described by its optimum @xmath13 states ,",
    "the @xmath18 states of the superblock can be expressed as @xmath19    we then diagonalize the full hamiltonian of the system in the superblock , isolating on its ground state , @xmath20 if we then construct the reduced density matrix of the enlarged block in the ground state , @xmath21 diagonalize it and retain the @xmath13 eigenstates with the largest eigenvalues we are _ guaranteed _ to have the @xmath13 most important ( or optimal ) states of the enlarged block in the ground state ( [ gs ] ) of the superblock .",
    "it is straightforward to target a group of states of the system , and not just the ground state , by constructing a mixed density matrix containing information on all of them .",
    "once the optimal @xmath13 states are chosen , we renormalize all required operators of the problem to the truncated space and store this information .",
    "this includes all sub - operators of the hamiltonian , @xmath22 having this information for the block and the additional level or site enables us to calculate all such matrix elements for the enlarged block as needed in the iterative growth procedure .      with the above remarks as background , the dmrg procedure involves the following stages .",
    "in the warmup stage we make an initial guess on the optimal @xmath13 states for each block .",
    "this choice is important in determining how rapidly the iterative procedure converges . in our treatment , we do this by growing blocks from each side of the chain gradually , using those orbits that have already been treated on the other end as the medium .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in figure 2 for two successive steps of the warmup procedure .",
    "is enlarged to include the next site @xmath23 , with the medium being a block involving the optimum states from the sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 obtained in the previous warmup step .",
    "( b ) a block involving the sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 is enlarged to include the next site @xmath8 , with the medium being a block involving the optimum states from the sites @xmath5 and @xmath23 obtained in the warmup step of part ( a ) . ]",
    "is enlarged to include the next site @xmath23 , with the medium being a block involving the optimum states from the sites @xmath24 obtained previously .",
    "( b ) a block involving the sites @xmath5 and @xmath23 is enlarged to include the next site @xmath25 , with the medium being a block involving the optimum states from the sites @xmath26 obtained previously . ]    in this stage of the process , schematically illustrated in figure 3 , we gradually sweep back and forth through the sites of the lattice , at each step of the sweep using for the medium the results either from the warmup phase ( during the first sweep ) or from the previous sweep stage . the sweep process is done over and over until convergence is achieved from one sweep to the next .",
    "the above calculations are done for a given choice of @xmath13 .",
    "the calculations are then done as a function of @xmath13 , until the changes with increasing @xmath13 are acceptably small .",
    "as noted earlier , most dmrg approaches violate symmetries . in nuclei , for example",
    ", they typically work in the m - scheme .",
    "such a procedure is potentially problematic when imposing truncation , however , as it is difficult to ensure that the states retained contain all the components required by the clebsch gordan series to build states of good angular momentum .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to develop an angular - momentum - conserving variant of the dmrg method in which angular momentum is preserved throughout the growth , truncation and renormalization stages .",
    "the most significant difference between this ( the jdmrg ) approach and the more traditional dmrg approach is that now we must calculate and store the _ reduced matrix elements _ of all sub - operators of the hamiltonian ,    @xmath27^k , ~ [ a^{\\dagger}_ia^{\\dagger}_j]^k , ~\\left ( [ a^{\\dagger}_ia^{\\dagger}_j]^k\\tilde{a}_k\\right)^l , \\nonumber \\\\ & & ~\\left([a^{\\dagger}_ia^{\\dagger}_j]^k ~[\\tilde{a}_k\\tilde{a}_l]^k \\right)^0~ + h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this can be done using standard racah techniques .      in the nuclear shell - model calculations we will report here ,",
    "we adopt a three - block strategy for the enlargement and truncation process , schematically summarized in figure 4 .",
    "we begin by choosing our order of sites so that neutron and proton orbitals sit on opposite ends of the chain .",
    "we then gradually grow blocks of each type of particle only , namely we grow neutron blocks and proton blocks but no mixed blocks .",
    "lastly , in the sweep stage we go back and forth through the orbits of a given type of particle only . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "the medium in this approach involves two components .",
    "if , for example , we are enlarging a proton block , the full medium ( @xmath10 ) involves all of the remaining proton levels ( @xmath28 ) and all of the neutron levels ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we have carried out test calculations of the jdmrg method described above on the nuclei @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that these nuclei can be described in terms of valence neutrons and valence protons outside a doubly - magic @xmath30 core .",
    "in both , we use the order of single - particle levels shown in figure 5 .",
    "we report the results for these two applications in the following subsections .",
    "we begin with our results for @xmath4 , for which there are four neutrons and four protons outside a @xmath30 core . in these calculations we assumed a kb3 effective interaction between valence nucleons and compared our results with those obtained for the same hamiltonian in ref .",
    "the size of the full shell - model space in this case involves 1,963,461 states , of which 41,355 are @xmath31 states , 182,421 are @xmath32 states , 246,979 are @xmath33 states , etc .",
    "our results for the ground state are presented in table i. the exact calculation produces a ground state energy of @xmath34 .",
    "the dmrg calculation converges smoothly to this result as @xmath13 is increased , but requires the inclusion of a substantial fraction of the full space to obtain a high level of accuracy . with of order 25% of the full @xmath31 space , we are able to achieve accuracy to only a few @xmath35 . to achieve an accuracy of better than 50 @xmath35 still requires , however , over 20 % of the full @xmath31 space .    in figure 5 , we show how the results converge as a function of the number of sweeps . as can be readily seen , after the first sweep we are extremely close to the final converged result .",
    "this is a direct consequence of our use of a warmup procedure that incorporates ( in step @xmath36 ) a significant part of the correlations .     and @xmath3 .",
    "]    .calculated ground - state energies in @xmath37 as a function of @xmath13 for @xmath0cr .",
    "the maximum dimension encountered in the sweep process is also given .",

    "in this talk , we have summarized the current status of our efforts to build the density matrix renormalization group method method into a practical truncation strategy for large - scale shell - model calculations of atomic nuclei . following an overview of the essential features of the method , we discussed the changes we had to implement for its application to nuclei .",
    "most importantly , we found it useful to develop an angular - momentum conserving version of the method , the jdmrg .",
    "we then summarized the results we have obtained for the nuclei @xmath0cr and @xmath1ni , in both cases comparing with the results of exact diagonalization .",
    "both calculations were able to accurately reproduce the exact shell - model results . in the case of @xmath4 , however , this high level of accuracy required us to retain a very large fraction of the full space .",
    "in contrast , we were able to achieve comparably accurate results for @xmath3 with a much smaller fraction of the space .",
    "the fact that the fraction of the space goes down rapidly with the size of the problem bodes well for the future usefulness of the method in even larger shell - model problems .",
    "there are several issues that we intend to explore in the near future .",
    "one concerns the need to determine through additional calculations how rapidly the fraction of the space required for convergence scales with the size of the problem .",
    "currently we only have two data points , @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "more are needed to draw meaningful conclusions .",
    "we are also looking into the question of whether we can obtain comparable agreement for both the ground state and low - lying excited states by building a mixed density matrix that includes information not only on the ground state but also on the first excited @xmath31 state .",
    "we are also in the process of applying these methods to odd - mass nuclei around @xmath3 .",
    "exact and coupled cluster results are now available for several such nuclei @xcite and we are interested in seeing how well the jdmrg truncation strategy works on these nuclei and how well it compares with the coupled cluster method .",
    "another issue of current interest concerns the possibility of breaking up large single - particle orbitals , rather than adding them in a single stage .",
    "we have some thoughts on how this might be done without losing angular momentum conservation and we are now testing these ideas on the @xmath38 orbital for the same nuclei we have already studied .",
    "if successful , we will then consider the application of these ideas to even larger shells , as will be critical for subsequent applications of the method to heavier nuclei , the ultimate goal of this project .",
    "this work is based on a talk presented by one of the authors ( s.p . ) at the xxxiind international symposium on nuclear physics held in cocoyoc , mexico from 5 - 9 january 2009 .",
    "it was supported by the us national science foundation under grant # phy-0553127 .",
    "we thank jorge dukelsky for his significant involvement in the development of the jdmrg method , nicu sandulescu for his major contributions to much of the work reported here , and alfredo poves for providing us with the kb3 matrix elements and @xmath4 exact results we reported ."
