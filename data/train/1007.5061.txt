    "in this section , we discuss some subtleties involved in coarse graining the gl free - energy ( [ eq : gl ] ) to arrive at the effective lattice model ( [ eq : latticemodel ] ) . in deriving the value of the xy stiffness @xmath191 , which couples the dimerization order parameter to phase fluctuations , we have made the simplifying approximation that the the superfluid stifness drops abruptly to zero at the location of an in - plane ising domain wall .    in reality",
    ", there is some residual superfluid stiffness that varies continuously across the length of the domain wall . keeping track of this residual",
    "stiffness corresponds to including higher order gradient terms such as @xmath192 , which includes terms of the form @xmath193 that couple domain walls and phase fluctuations .",
    "however , these terms are subleading and have a negligible effect on the systems phase diagrams .",
    "formally , this is because such higher order gradient terms are highly irrelevant in the renormalization group sense .",
    "we have also conducted separate simulations that include residual phase stiffness at the dimerization domain boundaries , and have explicitly confirmed that the resulting phase diagram is highly insensitive to the inclusion of such terms .",
    "specifically , in addition to the usual @xmath194 and @xmath195 , we allowed for @xmath196 , and verified that the choice of value for @xmath197 had little discernible effect on either the dimerization or bkt phase transitions .",
    "a second simplifying assumption is used in parameterizing the in - plane domain wall as @xmath198 .",
    "this parameterization implicitly assumes constant phase over the range of the domain wall , which is justified because @xmath199 . since @xmath200 is the shortest scale over which the phase is well - defined , it is essentially constant on lengthscales @xmath201 ."

    "<S> in contrast , for @xmath118 , already the dominant nearest neighbor interactions strongly favor dimerization and @xmath119 only produce small subleading corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion - _ our analysis of the layered dipolar fermi system predicts a sequence of two phase - transitions : an ising - like dimerization transition followed by a bkt transition to phase qlro . </S>",
    "<S> one can generalize to one - dimension , and consider a stack of one  dimensional tubes of dipolar fermions @xcite . in this case , no phase ordering can occur at any finite temperature , since the phase dynamics are strictly one  dimensional . however , a dimerization transition is still possible , leading to wider range of dimerized , non - superfluid phase@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the ising - xy model description of the layered dipolar fermions will be insufficient deep in the bec regime where interaction energies are dominant compared to the fermi - energy . for sufficiently strong interactions or sufficiently dense systems , the system will form a wigner crystal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is that the formation of longer chains of three or more dipoles may become important @xcite . in a regime where chains of @xmath120 dipoles are favorable </S>",
    "<S> , a many - layered system would undergo @xmath120-merization rather than dimerization . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , an @xmath120-merized phase may undergo an @xmath120-state clock - model - type phase transition which generalizes the ising - type dimerization transition considered above . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for even @xmath120 , bosonic chains could condense into an exotic superfluid of dipolar chains . </S>",
    "<S> such states offer an intriguing chance to examine the relatively unexplored boundary between few - body interactions and many - body phase transitions , and deserve further study .    </S>",
