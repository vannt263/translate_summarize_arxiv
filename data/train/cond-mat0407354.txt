    "this interest also involves the sample ability to rapidly change the magnetization state in order to optimize the individual recording time . particularly , magnetostatic modes are of practical importance in this matter ( especially in magnetization reversal processes ) , by reason of their low frequency range .",

    "the particle shape has to be taken into account . of course",
    ", the dominant mechanism in the creation of such a nonhomogeneity are long - range dipolar interactions .",
    "the dipolar size and shape effects present in the magnetostatic wave spectra of small nonellipsoidal particles result in additional power losses @xcite very important in device applications .    the nonuniform demagnetizing field in a normally magnetized disk was studied long ago by yukawa and abe @xcite , with the assumption of uniform saturation magnetization throughout the disk . analyzing the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) spectrum of the magnetostatic waves in a normally magnetized yig disk",
    ", the authors found that these waves were excited at the disk edge and propagated radially towards the disk center with increasing wave numbers .",
    "the dynamical properties of small magnetic elements have been actively investigated recently in studies using different methods and approaches .",
    "resonance methods combined with surface tunneling microscopy techniques enabled several teams @xcite to observe magnetostatic and exchange modes on a very local scale ; time - resolved and space - resolved moke experiments @xcite were used to study the local magnetization dynamics as well .",
    "these different methods give good indications of the localized magnetostatic mode existence , especially when the applied field is strong enough to induce a magnetization saturation throughout the sample .",
    "the localized magnetostatic mode dynamics has been investigated by several authors .",
    "@xcite studied the spin wave frequency spectrum and spatial distribution in thin @xmath3m - sized magnetic film samples .",
    "the lowest - frequency modes were found to correspond to oscillations restricted to the boundary regions , which start to ` propagate ' inside a rectangular magnetic sample as the frequency increases .",
    "@xcite applied a spatially resolved fmr technique to quantized magnetostatic mode imaging in small magnetic structures .",
    "they identified quantized magnetostatic modes in the obtained spectra , and from the observed spatial distribution of magnetization response at each mode peak deduced that the number of mode nodes decreased with increasing bias field .",
    "however , in their data interpretation some discrepancies were found between the measured mode frequency values and those calculated on the basis of the damon - eshbach theory @xcite .",
    "an exact theory of spin wave mode quantization in small magnetic structures needs to be developed .",
    "the dipole - exchange spectrum of the discrete spin wave modes resulting from the bias magnetic field inhomogeneity inside a nonellipsoidal rectangular magnetic sample has been studied recently by guslienko _",
    "the authors found that the strong inhomogeneity of the internal bias magnetic field along the magnetization direction results in spin wave mode localization at either the edges ( exchange localization ) or the center ( dipolar localization ) of the sample .",
    "we will show in this paper that in a cubic - shaped sample with an internal field nonhomogeneity resulting solely from pure dipolar interactions these two types of magnetostatic mode localization are also present ( it means magnetostatic modes are found to be localized not only at the cube center , but also on the cube surfaces ) .",
    "our theoretical approach is based on a modified draaisma - de jonge treatment @xcite used in the dipolar energy calculation . in the original draaisma - de jonge treatment",
    "a ferromagnetic film is considered as a set of discrete magnetic dipoles regularly arranged in a crystalline lattice .",
    "the dipolar energy is calculated by collecting contributions from each dipolar lattice plane assumed to be parallel to the film surface .",
    "the dipoles within each plane are divided into two sets : those within a circle of radius @xmath4 and those beyond that circle ; the total contribution of the former set is calculated discretely through summing over the dipoles , while the contribution of the latter set is evaluated by integration ( the circle radius should be large enough to assure reliable final results ) . in the approach used in our study , the discrete summation is performed over _ all _ the dipoles within a given dipolar plane ; thus , the integration is avoided , and no approximation is involved in our dipolar energy evaluation .",
    "the reason to use a discrete approach in the dipolar field calculation is our general belief @xcite that the continuous models @xcite used in deriving magnetostatic modes become rather questionable when applied to small samples containing a finite number of elementary spins .",
    "the complexity of introducing the long - range spin - spin interactions into the discrete approach is balanced by the restriction of our study only to the case of a uniform mode within each dipolar plane , which reduces the 3d problem to a single dimension ( this assumption is experimentally justified by the observed weak in - plane variability of the magnetic modes @xcite ) .",

    "a characteristic feature of the first - group modes is a zone of _ zeroing _ amplitudes around the sample center ; _ two _ non - zero amplitude regions are present at both sides of the central `` dead '' zone . each of these non - zero regions can be divided further into two sub - regions : an outer one , situated at the border , with ferromagnetic arrangement of the amplitudes which fade towards the sample borders , and an inner sub - region , with mostly antiferromagnetic arrangement of the amplitudes , reaching a maximum at a certain point .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ 4]b that the `` ferromagnetic tail '' extends as the mode energy increases , shifting the neighbouring localization region inside the sample ; finally the localization reaches the sample center , the modes entering the other group ( _ i.e. _ @xmath112 = 25 @xmath117 39 ) .",
    "typical for this group , the central localization region tightens around the sample center as mode energy increases .",
    "with respect to the above - discussed localization properties in both groups , the second - group modes can be qualified as _ center - localized _ ( _ cl _ ) , and the first - group ones as _ non - central bulk - localized _ ( _ ncbl _ ) ( or , alternatively , _ empty - center bulk localized _ ) .",
    "let s study in detail the ncbl mode properties .",
    "an extremely interesting feature of this group is both amplitude and energy double degeneration , appearing simultaneously .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",

    "its disappearance above this pair is easy to explain : as by definition , in antisymmetrical modes amplitude vanishes in the sample center , a necessary condition for their symmetrical counterparts to have identical amplitude distribution is a similar amplitude zeroing in the center ; but this occurs in ncbl modes only .",
    "the amplitude degeneration is associated with that of energy levels ; a double energy level degeneration in the ncbl group is apparent in fig .",
    "( when studying fig .",
    "[ 6 ] , note once more that the two highest modes , @xmath114 - 1 and especially @xmath114 , are apparently separated from the other mode energy levels . )    getting back to fig .",

    "an interesting thing to note is that each of these two highest modes can be regarded as the , , source  of a mode family formed by all the other modes within the given symmetry group .",
    "the generation of the lower modes from the initial be modes , @xmath114 or @xmath114 - 1 , is based on ferromagnetic tail shrinking : receding from the sample center , the tails give way to the formation of a new mode segment , with amplitudes localized in the center ( cl modes ) .",
    "the central localization zone broadens as energy decreases , to split into two separate ( right and left ) localization sub - zones , which migrate towards the borders following the continuously shrinking ferromagnetic tails .",
    "no more non - zero amplitudes appear in the vacated center , which therefore remains `` dead '' ; this corresponds to the formation of ncbl modes .",
    "when the non - zero amplitudes reach the borders ( which occurs in the lowest - frequency modes ) , the entire inside is dead , and the corresponding modes are of surface - localized nature .",
    "let s increase the cube size to examine its effect on the mode energy spectrum and profiles .",
    "[ 6]b shows a discrete mode frequency distribution calculated for a cube of size 2@xmath119=100 ; this distribution can be compared to that obtained for a cube of size 2@xmath119=40 , shown in fig .",
    "besides the obvious increase in the density of states ( resulting from the sample enlargement ) , the larger cube retains the basic characteristics observed in the smaller cube , namely : the double degeneration in the lower - spectrum modes , its absence in the upper modes , and the outstanding of the two highest modes .",
    "note that also the mode frequency range remains virtually unchanged , and that with the increased density of states , the linear character of the mode frequency _ vs_. mode number dependence is more apparent .",
    "however , this `` invariance '' of the energy spectrum does not translate into the amplitude profiles .",
    "[ 7 ] presents a juxtaposition of profiles of the five lowest modes and the six highest ones in cubes of two different sizes : 2@xmath119=40 and 2@xmath119=100 .",
    "the profile invariance is found to be limited to the be modes only ( @xmath112=1;2 ) whose profiles remain unchanged in spite of the size increase .",
    "the other states reveal apparently changed localization : the ncbl modes in the 2@xmath119=100 cube , showing substantially larger dead regions ( with respect to the 2@xmath119=40 cube ) , are practically of _ sub - surface localized _ ( ssl ) nature ; in the cl modes , the localization zone has tightened around the strict sample center .",
    "thus , we can anticipate that further size increase shall result in a deepening of the above - mentioned localization changes , and that consequently , the magnetostatic mode spectrum in large cubic samples shall consist of three clearly different mode groups : ( a ) two highest - frequency _ bulk - extended modes _ ( _ as _ and @xmath120 , ( b ) _ center - localized modes _ with intermediate frequencies , and ( c ) lowest - frequency _ surface - localized modes_. another way of illustration of this _ size - induced localization effect _ is given on the fig .",
    "obviously , we would like to understand why almost all of the modes forming the magnetostatic spectrum ( except for the two highest ones ) are of localized nature .",
    "we can suppose that this property is due to the long - range character of dipole interactions , as the latter as known to produce spatially nonhomogeneous demagnetization field in bounded non - ellipsoid systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , this is the case of the cube considered in this paper : plotted with bold line in fig . [ 9 ] , the local field @xmath121 , given by eq.([omegan ] ) , shows nonhomogeneous spatial distribution ( along the central axis ) , reaching a maximum in the sample center , and fading symmetrically towards the borders .",
    "the magnetostatic mode profiles , plotted in the same energy scale , have been superimposed on this local field plot .",
    "strikingly , the shape of the suppressed amplitude area in the bulk resembles exactly that of the nonhomogeneous distribution of @xmath122 , and all the ncbl mode frequencies lie within the local field value range .",
    "the cl mode frequencies coincide with the top of the @xmath122 curve , @xmath109 the region where the local field gradient is highest .",
    "the be mode frequencies lie _ above _ the @xmath122 value range , and one can think that this is why they are hardly sensitive to the local field variations .",

    "_ @xcite observed multipeak spectra interpreted as spin - wave resonance due to the non - uniform magnetization of the studied samples .",
    "we expect a similar study can be performed on cubic structures as well , with the aim of revealing different types of the above - described localized modes .",
    "one of the practical aspects of our study concerns the size - independence of magnetostatic mode frequencies found in cubic - shaped samples .",
    "this is in contrast with the recent report @xcite , where fmr spectra were measured for a series of single crystal yttrium - iron - garnet ( yig ) _ films _ of thickness ranging from 35 @xmath123 m to 220 @xmath123 m .",
    "the spectra were interpreted numerically on the basis of a model similar to ours , @xmath124 .",
    "taking into account the strongly inhomogeneous internal field , but the resonance fields ( measured for both in - plane and perpendicular configurations ) were found to be sensitive to the _ film _ thickness .",

    "[ 6 ] ) were found inside two cubes of different sizes , 2@xmath119=40 and 2@xmath119=100 , and moreover , the mode frequency spectrum distribution with respect to @xmath122 is almost identical in both cases . therefore , we may conclude that the above - discussed size - independence of our magnetostatic mode spectrum resulted from the assumed _ cubic _ shape of the studied sample .",
    "a problem to be solved next is the mode localization behaviour when the sample is , , deformed  , losing its cubic symmetry . in our next paper",
    "we are going to calculate the magnetostatic mode spectrum in a rectangular finite thin platelet .",
    "our preliminary results indicate that the magnetostatic mode localization effects described here for cubes are present in rectangular platelets as well .",
    "we believe , in fact , that this effect is just underlying the so - called ` bimodal ' statistical distribution of the internal field , recently revealed in finite yig thin films by pardavi - horvath and yan @xcite , and found to be clustered around two major components  a low - field peak corresponding to the central ( volume ) part of the sample , and a higher internal field related to the surface  which would correspond exactly to cl and sl modes disscussed in this work .",
    "closer elucidation of this analogy will be the subject of our subsequent paper .",
    "another question requiring future investigation is the mode localization dependence on mode propagation direction . in another study",
    "we are going to examine magnetostatic modes propagating _ perpendicularly _ to the applied field .",

    "<S> we investigate the dynamical properties of a system of interacting magnetic dipoles disposed in sites of an _ sc _ lattice and forming a cubic - shaped sample of size determined by the cube edge length @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the lattice constant , @xmath2 representing the number of dipolar planes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar field resulting from the dipole - dipole interactions is calculated numerically in points of the axis connecting opposite cube face centers ( _ central axis _ ) by collecting individual contributions to this field coming from each of the @xmath2 atomic planes perpendicular to the central axis . </S>",
    "<S> the applied magnetic field is assumed to be oriented along the central axis , magnetizing uniformly the whole sample , all the dipoles being aligned parallelly in the direction of the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency spectrum of magnetostatic waves propagating in the direction of the applied field is found numerically by solving the landau - lifshitz equation of motion including the local ( _ nonhomogeneous _ ) dipolar field component ; the mode amplitude spatial distributions ( _ mode profiles _ ) are depicted as well . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that only the two energetically highest modes have _ bulk - extended _ character . </S>",
    "<S> all the remaining modes are of _ localized _ nature ; more precisely , the modes forming the lower part of the spectrum are localized in the _ subsurface region _ , while the upper - spectrum modes are localized around the sample center . we show that the mode localization regions narrow down as the cube size , @xmath2 , increases ( we investigated the range of @xmath2=21 to @xmath2=101 ) , and in sufficiently large cubes one obtains practically only _ center - localized _ and _ surface - localized _ </S>",
