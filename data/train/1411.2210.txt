    "the atlas and cms collaborations at large hadron collider ( lhc ) have recently discovered a new bosonic resonance of mass around 125 gev @xcite .",
    "measuring its coupling to different standard model ( sm ) particles and establishing its nature are going to be leading aims of future lhc runs .",
    "although it is yet to be confirmed as sm higgs , in this paper we specify this resonance as higgs and denote it by @xmath3 .",
    "any deviations from its sm nature should exhibit in its coupling to different particles .",
    "anomalous couplings of higgs may come in both gauge and yukawa sectors . establishing the nature of",
    "the higgs will require a precise measurement of its gauge as well as yukawa couplings .",
    "in future lhc runs the coupling of higgs to @xmath4 bosons will be measured in several different channels such as @xmath5 .",
    "however , measuring its coupling to fermions as well as loop induced couplings like @xmath6 are going to be relatively more challenging .    in this regard ,",
    "several studies @xcite have been directed towards rare higgs decays such as @xmath0 ; @xmath1 being a vector quarkonium ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "although the branching ratios are small , rare higgs decays offer complimentary information about higgs couplings  @xcite and can serve as important probe of `` new physics '' ( np ) .",
    "besides , subsequent decays of @xmath2 and @xmath1 into pair of leptons make them experimentally clean channels . moreover , the decay rates are further enhanced by resonant production of @xmath1 and could be seen in high luminosity lhc runs or in future colliders . among rare higgs decays , the decay to a vector quarkonium ( @xmath8 ) received considerable attention in recent times . refs .",
    "@xcite have studied @xmath0 process with the aim to probe higgs couplings and new physics .",
    "there exist three different processes that contribute to the @xmath0 decay .",
    "@xcite calculate the decay rates for @xmath0 via @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "although in sm the process @xmath11 is loop suppressed , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that it can provide a significant contribution depending on the nature of the vector boson @xmath1 .",
    "there exist a third contribution where @xmath0 is produced via @xmath12 and ref .",
    "@xcite studies this channel assuming anomalous coupling in yukawa sector . as any of the above three processes could be anomalous ,",
    "in this paper we perform a model independent analysis of @xmath13 decay without making any assumption on its origin .",
    "we first calculate the sm contribution of the three processes and their respective interferences to the @xmath13 decay .",
    "we also write down the most general @xmath14 vertex and derive corresponding angular asymmetries from it .",
    "these asymmetries have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of @xmath15 and also in ref  .@xcite to probe non standard higss coupling via angular analysis .",
    "they provide powerful tools which can probe sm as well as any anomalous contributions to the decay .",
    "similar asymmetry has also been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite to measure @xmath16 odd properties of yukawa sector in @xmath0 decays . in our work",
    "we construct all possible asymmetries and perform a case by case analysis discussing relative contributions of different diagrams and their consequences on respective asymmetries .",
    "the plan of the paper goes as follows . in section  [ sec : direct ] we compute the sm contributions of the three processes and compare their relative strengths .",
    "section  [ sec : anghvz ] is devoted to formalize the angular analysis and construction of angular asymmetries for @xmath0 with further decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 into pair of leptons .",
    "we also discuss how to probe different higgs coupling using these angular asymmetries . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude our results .",
    "we start our discussion by first estimating the relative strength of sm contribution of different channels to the process @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a vector quarkonium ( @xmath18 ) . in particular we will focus on @xmath19 and @xmath20 but our analysis is general and can be used for any vector quarkonium .",
    "these decays receive contributions from three different diagrams as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "some of these contributions have been individually studied in previous works @xcite but a combined analysis is still lacking .",
    "the relative strengths of the diagrams and their interference terms vary depending on the final vector quarkonium resonance . because of quite different masses of @xmath21 and @xmath22 resonances the relative strengths of these diagrams differ appreciably in the two cases .",
    "we explicitly calculate the individual contributions for @xmath23 and @xmath20 to demonstrate this fact .    in sm the first diagram fig.[fig1](a )",
    ", originates from tree level @xmath24 gauge coupling .",
    "the matrix element for it is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 with @xmath27 as weinberg angle , @xmath28 for charm(@xmath29 ) quark and @xmath30 for bottom(@xmath31 ) quark .",
    "also , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the polarization vectors for @xmath2 and @xmath1 having momenta @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath36 is defined by the matrix element @xmath37 .    since in sm",
    "the @xmath6 coupling is forbidden at tree level , the second diagram fig.[fig1](b ) , can only arise via loop processes .",
    "one can compute this process by writing down an effective lagrangian for the @xmath6 coupling @xcite the matrix element for this diagram is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xmath40 is the dimensionless effective coupling constant for the @xmath6 vertex @xcite , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the third contribution fig.[fig1](c ) comes from @xmath44 yukawa coupling and is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the wave function of the vector quarkonium resonance evaluated at zero three momentum @xcite .",
    "the total decay width for @xmath0 process is combination of all three contributions given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 are obtained from @xmath50 and @xmath51 are interference terms between @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the individual contributions for both @xmath55 and @xmath20 are listed in table  [ tab ] .",
    ".contributions to the branching fraction from the three contributing diagrams and their interferences for @xmath19 and @xmath20 resonances .",
    "the total decay width of higgs is assumed to be @xmath56 mev .",
    "values of @xmath57 gev @xcite and @xmath58 @xmath59@xcite for @xmath60 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab ]    from table[tab ] it is clear that the relative contributions of the three channels is different for @xmath61 and @xmath22 resonances . in case of @xmath62",
    "the dominant contributions come from @xmath63 and @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath6 couplings respectively .",
    "the subleading contributions come from the interference terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the contribution @xmath67 coming from @xmath44 coupling is negligibly small .",
    "the major contribution from yukawa sector will come from the interference term @xmath66 .",
    "therefore while probing the anomalous yukawa couplings one should not neglect the contribution of the interference terms over @xmath67 .",
    "however , in case of @xmath22 the situation is quite different .",
    "the leading contribution comes only from the @xmath63 term whereas @xmath65 and @xmath68 provide the subleading contributions .",
    "the contribution of @xmath67 is now larger than @xmath64 but still negligibly small compared to @xmath63 .",
    "again as before while probing anomalous yukawa coupling the effect of interference terms can not be neglected .",
    "as discussed above the rare higgs decays @xmath0 are sensitive not only to @xmath24 coupling but also to @xmath6 and @xmath44 couplings .",
    "moreover , depending on nature of @xmath1 , the contribution of various higgs couplings to the decay widths vary widely .",
    "hence these decay modes have potential to provide information complimentary to @xmath69 `` golden channel '' .",
    "also , @xmath0 decays followed by a subsequent decay of @xmath2 and @xmath1 into pair of leptons will provide a experimentally clean channel that can be used to probe them in future colliders or high luminosity lhc runs .",
    "in next section we will discuss the angular analysis technique which provide a powerful tool for probing such couplings .",
    "in this section we formalize the necessary technique to probe @xmath71 vertex .",
    "we start with writing down general structure of the vertex and the different helicity amplitudes for @xmath0 process .",
    "the general lorentz structure of the @xmath71 vertex can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are vertex factors , @xmath76 is the momentum of higgs boson and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are momenta of @xmath2 and @xmath1 respectively . in sm @xmath77",
    "the couplings @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be extracted via angular asymmetries discussed below .",
    "any deviation from sm values will indicate anomalous nature of @xmath0 decay .",
    "the decay under consideration can be expressed in terms of three helicity amplitudes @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 defined in the transversity basis as @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are masses of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 respectively with @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "the helicity amplitudes @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 have definite parity properties .",
    "@xmath78 , @xmath79 are @xmath16 even in nature where as @xmath80 is @xmath16 odd .    the full angular distribution for @xmath87 is given by following expression    @xmath88    where the angle @xmath89(@xmath90 ) is the angle between three momenta of @xmath91 in @xmath2(@xmath1 ) rest frame and the direction of three momenta of @xmath2(@xmath1 ) in @xmath3 rest frame .",
    "the angle @xmath92 is defined as the angle between the normals to the planes defined by @xmath93 and @xmath94 in @xmath3 rest frame .",
    "the expressions for _ helicity fractions _",
    "@xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are given in the appendix .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "with respect to the angles @xmath98 or @xmath99 or @xmath92 , one can obtain following uniangular distributions : @xmath100 where @xmath101 are second degree legendre polynomial and @xmath102 the uniangular distributions in eq . , eq . and",
    "eq . will give us arsenal to probe the @xmath103 coupling .",
    "the observables @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 can be extracted using following asymmetries :    @xmath108    the observables @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 are functions of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and their measurements will allow us to probe @xmath103 coupling . in sm @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ,",
    "@xmath107 have unique values which can be computed using the sm values of the couplings @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 given in eq . ,",
    "eq . and eq .. the anomalous nature , if any , of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 will show up in the observables as deviation from their sm values .    as discussed in section [ sec : direct ] , the rare higgs decays are sensitive to @xmath24 , @xmath6 and @xmath44 couplings .",
    "therefore , any deviation of the observables @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 from their sm values can not a priori be attributed to anomalous nature of any one sector . however , when taken in conjugation with other decays like @xmath109 they can provide complimentary information about @xmath6 and @xmath44 couplings .",
    "for example , if any hint of anomalous nature is found in @xmath110 decay , one expects to see corresponding deviations in the observables of @xmath111 for both @xmath21 and @xmath22 . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath109 decay observables turn out to be consistent with the sm values then @xmath24 contribution in rare decays should also be sm like . in such a scenario",
    "any observed anomaly in @xmath0 can only come from either @xmath6 or @xmath112 couplings .",
    "as the magnitude of their contributions in @xmath113 and @xmath114 are quite different , this fact can be exploited to further narrow down the origin of the anomalous behaviour . moreover , for higgs decay to both @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the effect of any anomaly in yukawa sector will manifest itself predominantly through the interference terms .    in principle higgs",
    "can have anomalous couplings in more than one sector .",
    "if so , it will be relatively more difficult to make any definite conclusions about the relative contributions of the three sectors to the anomalous couplings of higgs in @xmath0 decays .",
    "we discuss the feasibility of probing the rare higgs decays @xmath103 followed by further decay of @xmath1 and @xmath2 into pair of leptons .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath103 decays receive contributions from gauge as well as yukawa sector and depending on the nature of @xmath1 , can be sensitive to anomalous couplings in more than one sector .",
    "they can provide complimentary information about the gauge and yukawa couplings of higgs .",
    "we then showed how observables extracted as angular asymmetries will allow us to extract information about @xmath71 coupling .",
    "such asymmetries have the potential to infer the nature of gauge and yukawa couplings of higgs in future colliders or high luminosity lhc runs .",
