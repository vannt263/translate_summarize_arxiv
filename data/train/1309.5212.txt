    "non - equilibrium phenomena are omnipresent . sometimes a rare phenomenon can cause massive effect on our everyday life .",
    "recently a study on a large deviation function ( ldf ) , which includes all the higher fluctuations , was extensively conducted in the context of non - equilibrium statistical physics @xcite .",
    "the ldf describes the probability of rare events , and disastrous events such as large earthquakes can be characterized by the ldf .",
    "moreover , phase transition between active and inactive phase is characterized by the ldf for an activity in a model of glassy dynamics @xcite .",
    "the approach using the ldf to dynamic behaviours is soundly progressing @xcite , however , studies concerning the ldf and criticality are yet developing .    in this study",
    ", we apply an approach using the ldf to the dynamic behaviours of a forest - fire model .",
    "originally , bak introduced the forest - fire model to simulate the system with temporally uniform injection and fractal dissipation of energy @xcite .",
    "the forest - fire model introduced by bak is later extended by drossel and schwabl @xcite in the context of self organaized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "drossel and schwabl represented forest - fire in the model with four processes : planting of trees , ignition , propagation of fire , and extinguishing of fire . to separate the timescale of the planting process and those of the latter three",
    ", an effective forest - fire model was introduced to analyze the model @xcite .",
    "the effective model reduces the last three processes to a single process , the vanishing of a cluster of trees .",
    "moreover , the effective forest - fire model can be formalized by a master equation @xcite and an analytical methods can be applied .",
    "the forest - fire model is also considered as a model of earthquakes @xcite .",
    "as an earthquake model , the planting of a tree corresponds to the loading of stress on the fault and the vanishing of a cluster of trees corresponds to the triggering of an earthquake which releases the stress on the connected loaded sites .",
    "a model similar to the one - dimensional forest - fire model with single triggering site at an edge was introduced as the minimalist model of earthquakes @xcite .",
    "the distributions of trigger sites change the size - frequency distributions of earthquakes in two - dimensional forest - fire models @xcite .",
    "recently , the ldfs for frequency of the largest earthquake in forest - fire models with different distributions of trigger sites was numerically calculated , and a nearly periodic to poisson occurrence depending on parameters and distribution of trigger sites is found @xcite .    here , we focus on the model m1 , which is the one - dimensional forest - fire model with single ignition site at an edge @xcite .",
    "m1 is expressed by a master equation , and a standard method to calculate the ldf with a modified transition matrix of the master equation @xcite can be applied to obtain the ldf for frequency of events .",
    "the ldf is given by the legendre transform of a generating function which is equal to the largest eigenvalue of the modified transition matrix .",
    "in this study , we derived an exact decomposition of the modified transition matrix for the frequency of events of size smaller than the system size in m1 , by applying a similarity transformation .",
    "the decomposition implies the system size independence of the ldf for the frequency .",
    "we numerically calculated the ldf for any system size and compared to that of the homogeneous poisson process .",
    "the decomposition enables us to discuss the exchange of the largest and the second largest eigenvalue of the modified transition matrix in the limit of infinitely large system size .",
    "we give introduction for the model we use in this study , the ldf and the method to calculate the ldf .",
    "next we derive the decomposition of the modified transition matrix .",
    "then , we give numerical calculations of the ldf . in the end , we present discussions .",

    "we found an exact decomposition of the modified transition matrix concerning the frequency of events of size @xmath116 in the model m1 .",
    "the decomposition leads to the independence of @xmath6 in the ldf for frequency of events of size @xmath116 .",
