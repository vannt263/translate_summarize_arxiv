    "in this report , i present results on two analyses done with data taken using the cleoiii detector on the cesr storage ring by the cleo collaboration .",
    "the first analysis is a search for the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decay @xmath6 , @xmath7 - all results from this analysis are preliminary .",
    "the second analysis tests lepton universality in the decays @xmath8 , @xmath7 - all results from this analysis are final .",
    "the cleoiii detector is a modern almost hermetic detector , sitting on the cesr beamline , where positrons and electrons collide with an energy @xmath9 .",
    "the detector included a silicon strip detector at its center , surrounded by a wire chamber , which provided tracking and de / dx information , a cesium iodide calorimeter , and a ring imaging cerenkov detector all in a 1.5 tesla magnetic field .",
    "outside of this were a series of muon chambers .",
    "further details of the detector can be found in @xcite .",
    "the data used in this analysis comprise the @xmath10 , @xmath7 datasets , along with a portion of the @xmath11 data for validation purposes .",
    "these datasets include data taken at the peaks of the resonances , as well as smaller datasets taken some @xmath12 below the resonances .",
    "the total sample includes approximately @xmath13 @xmath4 , @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 decays .",
    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) might provide a key to understanding lepton number violation , as well as baryon number violation , and hence might be helpful in understanding the matter / anti - matter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "lfv decays in the @xmath19 sector can be related to lfv decays of the @xmath5 lepton by a simple reordering of input and output lines in the feynman diagram for the process @xmath20 . in this way",
    ",  @xcite have show that a result of @xmath21 implies that @xmath22 .",
    "lfv decays of the @xmath19 to lepton pairs might also be expected in the presence of susy loops  @xcite , or other exotic physics such as leptoquarks and theories with more than one z boson .",
    "a general ansatz for talking about lfv decays of the @xmath19 involves a generic four fermion interaction vertex between two b quarks , a muon and a @xmath5 .",
    "with the coupling constant at the interaction denoted @xmath23 and the relevant new physics mass scale denoted @xmath24 , one finds  @xcite : @xmath25 .",
    "the cleo analysis presented here is a search for @xmath26 , n=1,2,3 .",
    "the final observed state is a two track event with a muon and a electron and missing energy .",
    "the muon would have an energy a little below the beam energy , while the electron energy spectrum would be approximately that expected for electrons in normal @xmath27 pair events .",
    "the fit to the data is performed using an extended maximum likelihood function , composed of a product pdf , summed over expect signal lfv shapes , direct @xmath28 shapes , @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 decays .",

    "the largest systematic uncertainties are from pdf shapes and their correlations .",

    "these limits set a lower limit of @xmath40 tev on the scale of new physics , assuming a strong coupling .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the standard model , the couplings between leptons and gauge bosons are independent of the lepton flavor , so the branching fractions for the decay @xmath41 should be independent of the flavor of the lepton @xmath42 , except for negligible final state lepton mass effects . any deviation from unity for the ratio of branching fractions @xmath43 would indicate the presence of new physics .",
    "the ratio @xmath44 is sensitive to the mechanism proposed in @xcite , in which a low mass cp - odd higgs boson , @xmath45 , mediates the decay chain @xmath46 .",
    "cleo has recently measured the partial width , @xmath47 , from @xmath48  @xcite , @xmath49 , as well as the branching fraction for @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "this analysis complements these measurements by measuring @xmath44 directly , and scales this result to obtain @xmath51 .",
    "an upper limit on the product branching fraction @xmath52 is extracted .",
    "the analysis technique , similar to that in @xcite , isolates the @xmath53 signals by subtracting a luminosity and beam energy weighted number of events observed in off - resonance data from the number observed in on - resonance data , and , after further background correction , attributes the remaining signal to @xmath19 decays to leptons .",
    "selection criteria are developed to isolate @xmath38 and @xmath54 final states using a subset of the data acquired near the @xmath11 .",
    "another subset of @xmath11 data is used to verify that subtracting the scaled off - resonance data from the on - resonance data produces no signal for @xmath55 , indicating that non-@xmath19 backgrounds are suppressed by the subtraction . as a further crosscheck",
    ", the off - resonance production cross - sections for @xmath54 and @xmath38 are verified to agree with theoretical expectations .",
    "selection criteria for the @xmath38 final state closely parallel those of @xcite , requiring tracks with momenta scaled to @xmath58 between 0.7 and 1.15 , of which at least one is positively identified as a muon . the energy deposited by a particle in a calorimeter shower , @xmath59 , is required to satisfy @xmath60 .",
    "no more than one shower unassociated with a track and with energy above 1% of @xmath58 is allowed .",
    "at least two neutrinos from final states of @xmath61 escape detection .",
    "thanks to cleo - iii s hermeticity , the following criteria select such events despite the energy carried away by the unreconstructed neutrinos .",
    "the total charged track momentum transverse to the beam direction must be greater than 10% of @xmath58 , and the total charged track momentum must point into the barrel region of the detector where tracking and calorimetry are optimal .",
    "events with collinear tracks are eliminated .",
    "tracks are required to have momenta greater than 10% of @xmath58 to ensure that they are well - reconstructed , and , to minimize pollution from two - particle final states , they are required to have momenta less than @xmath62 of @xmath58 .",
    "the total observed energy due to charged and neutral particles in the calorimeter is similarly required to be between @xmath63 and @xmath62 of the total center - of - mass energy . to reduce overlap confusion between neutral and charged particles , a shower s energy scaled to its associated track s momentum",
    "must be less than 1.1 .",
    "final states are further exclusively divided according to the results of particle identification into @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 sub - samples , with particles listed in descending momentum order .",
    "the first ( second ) particle listed is referred to as the tag ( signal ) .",
    "the sub - samples are used to crosscheck consistency of results across decay modes .",
    "lepton identification requires a track momentum greater than @xmath71 to ensure that the track intersects the calorimeter .",
    "electrons are identified by requiring that @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the track momentum , and that the specific ionization along the track s path in the drift chamber be consistent with the expectation for an electron .",
    "a muon candidate in @xmath5 decays is a charged track which is not identified as an electron , having momentum above @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) for a tag ( signal ) track and confined to the central barrel where beam related background is a minimum .",
    "furthermore , the energy deposited in the calorimeter for this track must be between @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and the particle must penetrate at least three interaction lengths into the muon detector .",
    "particles identified as neither e nor @xmath78 are designated @xmath79 , and are a mixture of hadrons and unidentified leptons .",
    "the decay products of @xmath5 pairs from @xmath19 decays tend to be separated into distinct hemispheres .",
    "since the photon spectrum expected in @xmath5 decays depends on the identity of the charged particle , calorimeter showers are assigned to either the tag or signal hemisphere according to their proximity to the tag side track direction .",
    "for each @xmath5 decay mode pair , the number of unmatched showers in the calorimeter as well as the total energy of these showers on each side of the decay are used as selection criteria .    for the @xmath64 and @xmath67 modes , the sum of the magnitudes of the tag and signal track momenta must be less than @xmath80 , reducing the contamination from radiative dilepton events . to reduce backgrounds from @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the @xmath64 , @xmath67 , @xmath70 categories , the minimum polar angle of any unseen particles , deduced from energy - momentum conservation , is required to point into the barrel region , where calorimetry cuts will ensure rejection .",
    "figure  [ fig : onoff ] shows the superimposed on - resonance and scaled off - resonance total energy distributions for the @xmath54 sample for all resonances .",
    "the scale factor is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the data luminosity and squared center of mass collision energies on and off the resonances , and @xmath86 is an interference correction .",
    "the luminosity is derived from the process @xmath87 @xcite , which does not suffer backgrounds from direct @xmath19 decays .",
    "the interference correction @xmath86 accounts for the small interference between the process @xmath88 and @xmath89 and is estimated  @xcite to be 0.984 ( 0.961 , 0.982 ) at the @xmath4 @xmath90 and negligible for the @xmath11 .",

    "this uncertainty is consistent with the variation in the product of the off - resonance cross section and reconstruction efficiency using the fpair , koralb , and babayaga monte carlo simulations , and is thus likely conservative , as direct @xmath38 production from the @xmath19 at the peak involves much lower energy final state photons than off resonance production .",
    "an uncorrelated uncertainty of @xmath186 for modeling of @xmath104 is assumed , consistent with the uncertainty on the off - resonance production cross section derived in previous analyses , and is again conservative as on - resonance production of @xmath54 final states involves fewer photons than direct continuum production . to test the sensitivity to isr simulation , the reconstruction efficiency for events with no isr simulation",

    "we have also reported the ratio of branching fractions of @xmath19 decays to @xmath54 and @xmath38 final states , and find these to be consistent with expectations from the standard model .",
    "these ratios have been combined with results from @xcite to provide absolute branching fractions for the process @xmath104 , shown in table  [ tab : finalresults ] , resulting in the most precise single measurement of @xmath196  @xcite , a much improved value of @xmath197 and a first measurement of @xmath198 .",
