    "active motion is a phenomenon found ubiquitously in nature ranging from the colony organization of microorganism , biological springs , molecular motors , nano - robotics  @xcite , a flocking of fish and birds to swarming of small insects  @xcite .",
    "all of these types of active motions need processes of energy supply , conversion to motion , and resupply for repeated motions .",
    "to describe these processes , an energy depot model was introduced by schweitzer _ et .",
    "al _  @xcite . in the energy depot model , supplied energy is able to induce effectively a negative friction in a certain range of velocity yielding an active motion .",
    "this model was successfully applied to a wide variety of active motions  @xcite mainly assuming that the energy conversion rate into the motion depends only on the quadratic form of the velocity .",
    "this success of the quadratic energy conversion rate model immediately raises the possibility that other diverse active motions can be induced , when the energy conversion rate contains various terms in velocity including the quadratic one .",
    "another motivation for the present study originates from the fields of nano - robotics and artificial molecular motions  @xcite .",
    "rapid developments in these area require diverse controlling technology for energy conversion for intended purpose .",
    "although it is still at a primitive stage at present , control of the energy conversion will become fine - tuned in the near future so that any desired motion could be selectively achieved .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we consider various forms of the conversion rate of the internal energy into a motion in this paper . hence our work provides a correlation between the form of energy conversion and the active motion .    in the following sections , we introduce our generalized energy depot model in detail and consider various forms of the conversion rate which could induce diverse active motions including a braking mechanism applicable to nonlinear compressive behavior of basilar membrane in the inner ear  @xcite , a directed stepping motion shown in the molecular motor systems  @xcite , or a phenomenon of negative stiffness for oscillatory system such as the hair bundle in mammals  @xcite .",
    "concluding remarks will follow .",
    "a brownian particle moving in an external force @xmath0 is governed by the langevin equation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass , @xmath3 the velocity of the particle , @xmath4 the friction coefficient , @xmath5 the temperature , and the white noise , @xmath6 satisfies @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the passive motion can be converted to the active motion when the internal energy depot is introduced .",
    "the internal energy of the depot , @xmath9 , is regarded as an additional degree of freedom for each particle .",
    "the energy balance equation for the depot can be described as  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the timescale of relaxation of the depot , @xmath12 the rate of the energy influx to the depot , @xmath13 the rate of energy dissipation of the depot , @xmath14 the conversion rate of the internal energy into motion .",
    "@xmath15 means that the depot reacts with a time lag and @xmath16 that the depot adapts very fast ( adiabatic approximation ) .",
    "we note that the conversion rate of the internal energy into motion can be , in general , a function of both velocity and position of the particle , which contains various combinations of the two variables  @xcite . in order to understand the roles of individual terms ,",
    "we expand @xmath14 as follows , @xmath17 we can choose @xmath18 since the effect of constant conversion rate can be merged into the constant dissipation rate .",
    "consequently , the langevin equation for an active brownian particle is written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the above equations are intuitive in a sense that the brownian particle is governed by an extra active force or that the friction is modified to depend on the space and velocity , when external energy is supplied .",
    "it is noticeable that the effective friction can be negative or larger than the normal friction @xmath4 .",
    "the effective friction will be discussed in the next section in detail .    in this paper , @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "are assumed to be constant for simplicity and main focus is given on the effect of the conversion rate .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the conversion rate @xmath22 depending only on the velocity first and @xmath14 in a special form later . even when only velocity - dependent conversion rate is considered , diverse properties can be discussed such as the motion with a braking mechanism , the stability of fixed points , and a stepping motion . a special form of @xmath14 is chosen to describe a possibility of a negative stiffness .",
    "the active brownian particle with @xmath23 has been previously treated in detail and it is shown that the friction can be effectively negative when the particle moves slowly and increases only up to @xmath4 as the particle moves faster  @xcite . hence , for an active particle with @xmath24 , speed can be increased without any limit .",
    "since such an excessive speed can damage living organisms , it may be possible that a living organism is equipped with a protective mechanism to prevent damage from excessive movement or energy pumping , especially in underdamped oscillating systems .",
    "also , in nano - robotics , adoption of this type of protective mechanism may be not only helpful to control the movement , but also essential to safeguard the mechanism from overdriving .",
    "thus , study on contributions from higher order velocity terms are highly desirable .    motivated from these arguments ,",
    "we first study a symmetric form including up to a fourth order term in the conversion rate of the internal energy into motion . hence , @xmath25 where the positive ( negative ) @xmath26 increases ( decreases ) the kinetic energy of the particle .",
    "since we are interested in the braking mechanism , only the negative case will be treated . by introducing a critical velocity , @xmath27 , the conversion rate is rewritten as @xmath28 it implies that the energy depot reabsorbs the kinetic energy when the velocity goes beyond the critical velocity .",
    "this mechanism is analogous to the regenerative - brake system in automobiles and electric vehicles  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that this regenerative - braking can not only control the motion more effectively , but also save energy for operation .",
    "thus , we name this fourth - order model as a brownian energy depot model with a braking mechanism .    , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are used for the numerical calculation . ]    to describe the effect of the fourth order term in the conversion rate , let us consider an adiabatic approximation , @xmath16 , in which the energy depot adapts very fast .",
    "the adiabatic solution of the internal energy of depot yields  @xcite @xmath32 hence the effective friction coefficient becomes @xmath33 note that @xmath34 .",
    "the effective friction describes three different situations ; ( i ) pumping where @xmath35 , ( ii ) dissipation where @xmath36 , and ( iii ) protection where @xmath37 .",
    "the particle can not speed up when the velocity exceeds the critical velocity in this model , since the fourth order term in the conversion rate induces sufficiently large friction to the particle .",
    "superficially , the present model appears to be similar to the rayleigh model  @xcite , but with different interpretations .",
    "we believe that the newly introduced braking mechanism may offer a plausible way to discuss any underdamped motions and protection from any overreacting motion in living organisms and nano - robotics . recently by adopting this mechanism to the active oscillation of the basilar membrane ( bm ) in the mammalian ear , we could successfully explain the known experimental results and the noise amplification in cochlea  @xcite .",
    "so far , we have restricted the conversion rate @xmath22 to be symmetric in the velocity .",
    "however , the active particles generally possess polarities in their motions  @xcite .",
    "the polarity of the motion is originated from the external force or / and the asymmetric conversion rate . to discuss the generic polarity of the motion , in this section",
    ", we consider a general form of @xmath22 , @xmath38 it is expected that inclusion of these odd terms allows the active particles perform polarized motions as observed in molecular motors such as kinesin and dynein . now",
    ", it is worth to analyze the deterministic dynamics in the @xmath39 phase space which is governed by @xmath40 where the depot takes time to be filled with energy ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "it is well known that long time behavior of a two - dimensional continuous dynamical system possesses only fixed points and limit cycles  @xcite . although it is not possible to describe the solution analytically , local stability for existing fixed points can be analyzed through the jacobian matrix and its eigenvalues  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the stability of the fixed points obtained numerically for various values of @xmath41 . for the numerical calculation , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are used .",

    "the `` atp - binding '' plays a role of the energy input ( @xmath110 ) while stalling ( @xmath111 ) and the `` atp - hydrolysis and movement '' corresponds to the energy consumption ( @xmath112 ) for the acceleration ( @xmath113 ) in our model .",
    "when adp is released , there is no energy cost . hence the `` attachment and adp - releasing '' state corresponds to decelerating state ( @xmath114 ) in our model .",
    "the difference between the three state model for the molecular motor and our generalized energy depot model is that the molecular motors are walking on tracks such as microtubule or actin filaments .",
    "however , the interaction between the motor protein and the microtubule or the actin filament can be considered in our model by introducing the corresponding external force . we will report on this work later elsewhere .",
    "so far , we have neglected the stochastic noise contribution to the motion of the active particles .",
    "however , the thermal fluctuation is inevitable and expected to play an important role especially in the motion of the molecular motors and nano - robots .",
    "hence we include the stochastic term with the noise strength @xmath115 in calculation of the motion .",
    "we calculate the effect of the stochastic noise to the stepping motions described in fig .",

    ", we compare the present work to the existing studies on the directed motion of active particles  @xcite . in those works ,",
    "the asymmetry of space was described by an external rachet potential  @xcite . however , in our model , this asymmetry is given by the conversion function , i.e. , the energy depot itself . in our model , the noise introduces occasional backward motion as observed in experiments  @xcite , unlike previous models .",
    "therefore , further study on the effect of the external ratchet potential on the present model appears necessary to understand the physical origin of the motional polarity .     when @xmath66 , @xmath56 , @xmath74 , @xmath119 , and the noise strength is @xmath118 ; ( a ) @xmath120 ( b ) @xmath121 . ]",
    "the conversion rate of the internal energy into the motion is in general a function of space and velocity  @xcite .",
    "as we have observed that the velocity dependent conversion rate can induce an active behavior in certain velocity range , it is expected that a position dependent conversion rate may also introduce an active behavior in oscillation . in this section",
    ", we consider a special form of the space - dependent conversion rate to show that our generalized energy depot model induces an active behavior in certain spatial range .",

    "in this paper , we have presented a general model of active brownian particle in which the conversion rate of the internal energy into the motion is a general function of the velocity of the particle .",
    "we have shown that when the conversion rate depends only on @xmath137 and @xmath138 , an active amplification and a protective braking mechanism appear .",
    "we believe that this active amplification with a braking mechanism can provide a new paradigm for any underdamped biological systems and nano - machines .",
    "it is conceivable that the evolutionary tactic in biological system may have provided such protective mechanisms to any underdamped biological units to protect them from excessive oscillations .",
    "such a self - adapting mechanism will be also needed in designing nano - machines .",

    "such a directed motion suggest a possibility of overcoming any extra load on the particle . another most remarkable behavior is a stepping motion described as a limit cycle .",
    "such a stepping motion has a polarity hence being applicable to the molecular motors .",
    "when the conversion rate depends on not only the velocity but also the position of the particle , it has been shown , for a very special case , that the effective stiffness of an oscillatory system could be negative .",
    "such a behavior has been observed in the hair bundle motion in the inner ear .",
    "hence it also suggests a possible connection between our generalized energy - depot model and a relevant biological system .",
