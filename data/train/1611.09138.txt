    "metal  organic frameworks ( mofs ) @xcite are exciting materials due to their unprecedented nanostructures that are tailored on a bulk scale by matching up designated metal ligands and organic linkers . their colourful appearances that can change for",
    "instance with solvent exchange and molecular doping @xcite signify their chromophoric nature .",
    "also , mofs diverse physical and chemical tunability is promising as demonstrated via building block replacement @xcite and infiltration with redox - active molecules @xcite .",
    "mofs high internal surface areas are advantageous for gas sorption @xcite or chemical sensors @xcite , as demonstrated with h@xmath3 @xcite , co@xmath3 @xcite , n@xmath3 and methane @xcite .",
    "mofs built with tcnq linker exhibited an excellent selective uptake of o@xmath3 and no @xcite in comparison to n@xmath3 , co , co@xmath3 , c@xmath3h@xmath3 or ar , and separation of benzene from cyclohexane @xcite , as a result of guest - host charge transfer interactions .",
    "furthermore , nanoscale voids in mofs were able to accommodate molecules as large as bucky fullerene @xcite .",
    "one of the challenges towards their electronic applications is to make mofs optimally conductive to be used as electronic components @xcite .",
    "it is only recently that electrically conductive mofs were realized through covalent interactions @xcite or redox active guest molecules , i.e. , hole doping with tcnq@xcite .    in this article ,",
    "we study co - mof-74 ( also called co - cpo-27 or co2(dobdc ) ) crystals @xcite in various forms from nanocrystals to microcrystals and thin films ( see si , section 1.1 ) . infiltrated with tcnq ( see the diagram in fig.[xrd]a ) , charge transfer between the host framework and the guest molecule leads to advanced optical and electrical transport properties . based on the enhanced electronic conduction of the charge - transfer mof as well as",
    "its extended optical absorption profile covering the entire visible range , we demonstrate their resistive photo- and gas - sensing capabilities , both of which are key properties towards mofs electronic applications .",
    "x - ray diffraction profiles for co - mof-74 microcrystals before and after infiltration with tcnq are plotted with respect to @xmath4 in fig .",
    "the peaks at 6.86@xmath5 and 11.86@xmath5 indexed to ( 1  1  0 ) and ( 3  0  0 ) with @xmath6 originate from the hexagonal structure .",
    "the dashed vertical lines are the first two diffraction lines expected for co - mof-74 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding lattice spacings are 0.645 and 0.375  nm , respectively . with the inclusion of tcnq",
    ", the peaks get slightly upshifted and broader , indicating a contracted and distorted lattice structure , respectively ( see si , section 3 ) .    a bright field ( bf ) transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) image of co - mof-74 in fig .",

    "[ tem]b confirms the crystallite co - mof-74 structure , consistent with the xrd profile in fig .",
    "annular dark field ( adf ) scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem ) at higher magnification in fig .",
    "[ tem]c further corroborates the crystalline nature of individual nanocrystals of @xmath7415  nm size .",
    "figure  [ tem]d finally visualizes the honeycomb pore structure in one of these co - mof-74 nanocrystals , consistent with a co - mof-74 crystal viewed along the [ 001 ] zone axis , as shown in the image simulation in fig .  [ tem]e .",
    "note that characterization of mofs by tem / stem is notoriously challenging because of the high susceptibility of the organic linkers to electron beam induced degradation .",
    "our high - resolution microscopy data is the first such available on co - mof-74 nanocrystals to date .",
    "a prominent change upon infiltration with tcnq is observed in the mof s colour that is originally orange turning into dark cyan , see the optical micrographs in fig .",
    "[ optraman ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ optraman]a , neutral tcnq@xmath8 in toluene has its giant optical transition peak located at about @xmath7395  nm ( 3.15  ev ) , that makes it look orange , while co - mof-74 has a weak absorption peak at @xmath7410  nm ( 3.0  ev ) . as tcnq infiltrates co - mof-74 ,",
    "a strong new absorption peak emerges at @xmath7660  nm ( 1.9  ev ) in addition to the co - mof-74 peak .",
    "accordingly , the optical gap estimated from the lowest energy peak onset is reduced by more than 1.0  ev .",
    "the strongest absorption structures of tcnq@xmath9 monomer at around 800  nm @xcite are not visible , excluding the presence of monovalent tcnq .",
    "absorption at @xmath7 2  ev ( @xmath7640  nm ) was previously observed as a minor component of absorption profiles for tcnq@xmath9 dimers in aqueous solution @xcite , blue - shifted as compared to the corresponding absorption in tcnq@xmath9 monomers .",
    "absorption structures at a similar energy region were also observed in tcnq@xmath9 salts in the solid state @xcite , but again only as a minor absorption associated with locally excited transitions polarized perpendicular to the molecular chain axis @xcite .",
    "it is known that the disproportionation occurs so a tcnq@xmath10 dimer transforms to a pair of tcnq@xmath8 and tcnq@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the tcnq@xmath11 divalent anion in solutions exhibits a large broad absorption peak at around 2  ev ( @xmath7640  nm ) @xcite , along with high energy absorption peaks at about 300  nm @xcite .",
    "hence , the 2  ev ( @xmath7640  nm ) peak of tcnq@xmath10 dimers observed previously could be the component of disproportionated tcnq@xmath11 . note that tcnq@xmath11 s oxidation product , dicyano - p - toluoyl cyanide ( dctc@xmath9 ) ,",
    "has an absorption peak at about 480  nm as observed via electrochemical doping @xcite and molecular orbital calculations @xcite , as well as in charge transfer salts @xcite . in our case , the 660  nm peak can be attributed to that of tcnq@xmath11 , which means that the charge transfer occurs so [ tcnq]@xmath11 [ co - mof-74]@xmath12 salt is created .",
    "the assignment of the 660  nm peak to the tcnq is backed up by the fact that raman response of the tcnq acceptor is resonance enhanced , see si , section 5 .",
    "fig.[optraman]b compares raman data collected with a laser wavelength of 633  nm ( in resonance with tcnq@xmath11 ) for co - mof-74 before and after infiltration with tcnq as well as that for tcnq crystals .",
    "the major four lines for tcnq crystals are located at raman frequencies of 1207.5 , 1455.5 , 1602.8 and 2228.5  @xmath13 , assigned to the c = ch bending , c - cn wing stretch , c = c ring stretch and c@xmath14n stretch modes , respectively . in tcnq@co - mof-74 ,",
    "those except for the c - cn wing stretch mode are visible at 1195.5 , 1600.8 , 2226.0  @xmath13 although the c = ch bending mode frequency is markedly red - shifted by -12  @xmath13 .",
    "there are weak peaks that can be assigned as frequency - shifted modes for the co - mof-74 component , except for the peak at 1352  @xmath13 whose intensity is comparable to those of the other three tcnq modes . hence , this peak can be assigned to the c - cn wing stretch mode shifted by -103.5  @xmath13 . indeed , the c - cn wing stretch mode is known to frequency - shift by doping as electrons are preferentially accommodated in the wings of tcnq @xcite . from a comparison to previously reported frequency shifts for ionic tcnqs , the corresponding doping level is @xmath7 1.5  @xmath15  0.2  e@xmath10 per tcnq , see si , section 6 . this non - integer charge number lower than 2  e@xmath10 per tcnq estimated from the optical absorption data in the previous section could be due to possible guest - host orbital mixing , as reported previously in cu@xmath16(btc)@xmath3 ( btc = benzene tricarboxylate ) , commonly known as hkust-1 @xcite .",
    "note that no sign of dctc@xmath9 is observed in the raman data @xcite .",
    "if there is a guest - host chemical bonding , it could be between oxygen and tcnq wing as suggested in the copper - based hkust-1 infiltrating tcnq @xcite",
    ". it could also be such a process like tio@xmath3-tcnq colouration leading to interfacial charge - transfer optical transitions @xcite .",
    "figure [ xps]b shows x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) data at the n1@xmath17 edge . for neutral tcnq in powder , n@xmath18 peak is observed at 399.4  ev , about  2  ev above which is a shake - up . for the tcnq in mofs , the main peak ( peak 1 )",
    "is shifted to 400.2  ev with an enhanced broad shake - up peak ( peak 2 ) at 401.7  ev .",
    "this is in contrast to the case for tcnq@xmath9/cu(100 ) @xcite and lithium - intercalated tcnq @xcite , in which the main peak is shifted towards a lower binding energy and the shape - up feature suppressed , both attributed to the addition of one electron .",
    "screening effect enhanced due to reduced charge transfer energy @xmath19 should also reduce the binding energy , that could be due to enhanced conductance in the tcnq@xmath11 .",
    "hence , molecular orbital changes that possibly involve orbital hybridizations between nitrogen and the host is likely to explain the energy shifts to higher binding energies .",
    "the two n  1@xmath17 splits with area intensities of 0.42 ( peak 1 ) and 0.58 ( peak 2 ) are indicative of two distinguished chemical states of nitrogen due to an asymmetric charge distribution as a result of chemical bonding possibly on one side of the tcnq .",
    "see si , section 7 for further details .      provided that the electronic gap is reduced by doping , our charge - transfer tcnq@co - mof-74 could become more conductive , as reported previously on hkust-1 infiltrated with tcnq @xcite . while the non - doped mof is as insulating as the glass substrate at temperatures up to 450  k , the resistance of the doped mof falls into a measurable range .",
    "[ i - v]a presents the current  voltage ( i - v ) characteristics of a tcnq - mof film grown directly on interdigitated gold electrodes on a glass plate .",
    "the data measured at various temperatures in a range from 350 up to 450  k are nonlinear and follow a power - law dependence @xmath20 ( see si , section 8.1 ) . for the electrical conduction through metal electrode ",
    "dielectric interfaces , the space charge limited ( scl ) conduction model @xcite predicts a power - law scaling @xmath21 . assuming that the measured conduction across the tcnq - mof device is expressed as ohmic ( @xmath22 ) and scl ( @xmath23 ) resistances connected in series , i.e. , @xmath24 , we can fit the data fairly well , see fig .",
    "[ i - v]a .",
    "the ratio of @xmath25 to @xmath26 , apparently scaled by @xmath27 , goes down with the temperature , but stays well above one in the sub-@xmath28a range ( see si , section 8.2 ) , meaning that the ohmic conduction is dominant .    in turn , the voltage versus inverse temperature measured with various currents up to 1.2  @xmath28a exhibits a linear slope in an arrhenius plot in accordance with the function @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant , with an carrier injection activation energy of @xmath31 = 0.25  ev , see fig .",
    "[ i - v]b .",
    "our tcnq  mof with the enhanced electrical conduction is a good candidate as a resistive sensing element .",
    "figure [ sensing]a demonstrates the resistance at room temperature markedly reduced upon exposure to a uv light - emitting diode ( led ) radiation with a central wavelength ( photon energy ) of 395  nm ( 3.14  ev ) , while only a subtle reduction ( about twenty times smaller ) is observed with a infra - red led radiation with a central wavelength ( photon energy ) of 940  nm ( 1.32  ev ) .",
    "this is fully consistent with a optical absorption gap of @xmath71.5  ev .",
    "we further test our device for gas sorption .",
    "figure [ sensing]b shows the resistance of the tcnq  mof at 400  k at different pressures of argon exhibiting its drop as the pressure increases .",
    "the response is reversible so that the resistance goes back to the original value when the gas is evacuated .",
    "the fact , that the reduction occurs in the same way upon exposures to argon , nitrogen , oxygen and carbon dioxide regardless of their redox properties , means that it is pressure induced rather than carrier doping .",
    "generally , dissipative heat loss due to an increased number of gaseous molecules in the vacuum chamber leads to enhanced resistances , opposite to what is observed here .",
    "the fact that the pressure ( p ) dependence follows langmuir s surface coverage , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 = 0.024  mbar , indicates that the device responds to the physical adsorption onto the tcnq  mof .",
    "charge transfer between molecular components is central to metallic conduction and superconductivity in charge - transfer complexes and doped organic molecules @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the guest - host charge transfer and orbital hybridization induce the electrical conduction of mofs , based on which we have performed resistive photo- and gas - sensing experiments .",
    "the implementation of doped mofs as highly porous electrodes demonstrated in this study would pave the way towards advanced technology that exploits extraordinary physical and chemical properties of mofs .",
