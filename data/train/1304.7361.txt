    "solar flares are the most energetic explosions on the surface of the sun , and are thought to occur by release of magnetic energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "flares are also known to occur on various types of stars including solar - type stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . among them , young stars or close binary stars sometimes produce `` superflares '' , flares whose total energy is @xmath0 times more energetic ( @xmath1 erg ) than the largest flares on the sun ( @xmath2erg ) @xcite .",

    "+   +  consequently , most of the brightness variations with the period of a few days to a few tens of days and the amplitude of 0.1 @xmath5 10% are expected to be able to be explained by assuming that the star has fairly large starspots .",

    "figure [ period_plot ] ( a ) indicates that the most energetic flare observed in a given rotation period bin does not have a correlation with the period of stellar rotation . if the superflare energy can be explained by the magnetic energy stored near the starspots ( we discuss this in section [ sec : discussion ] ) , this result suggests that the maximum magnetic energy stored near the spot does not have a strong dependence on the rotation period .",

    "it is known that there are positive correlations between the sunspot coverage and the energy of the largest solar flares @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , important to consider whether the same correlations can be found and the observed maximum of superflare energy can be explained by the magnetic energy of large starspots which many of the superflare stars are expected to have .",
    "although we have already simply discussed the relation between the amplitude of superflares and that of the brightness variations in supplementary information section of @xcite , we here advance this former analysis and discuss whether the magnetic energy of starspots can well explain the energy of superflares by applying the results in this paper that starspot coverages can be roughly estimated from the brightness variation .",
    "+   +  first , we discuss expected relations if the energy sources of superflares are the magnetic energy stored around the starspots ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the total energy released by the flare must be smaller than ( or equal to ) the magnetic energy stored around the starspots .",
    "the order of the stored magnetic energy ( @xmath49 ) can be roughly estimated by @xmath50 where @xmath40 and @xmath51 correspond to the magnetic field strength and the size of the starspot region .",
    "it should be noted that we can not exclude the possibility that starspots of superflare stars are collections of smaller spots .",
    "+   +   we roughly assume that there is a linear correlation between the brightness variation and the spot coverage when we estimate the magnetic energy stored around the starspots from the amplitude of the brightness variation .",
    "the total amplitude of the brightness variation due to the rotation normalized by the average brightness ( @xmath52 ) can be expressed by @xmath53\\frac{a_{\\rm spot}}{a_{\\rm phot } } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the total area of starspots , and @xmath55 is the total visible area of the stellar surface .",
    "since the kepler photometer covers a wide spectral rage ( 4,000 @xmath5 8,500 ) , observed brightness changes would be nearly approximated by the bolometric brightness change obtained by the equation ( [ energy2 ] ) . +   +  if we assume that @xmath56 , the equation ( [ energy1 ] ) can be transformed to @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the total energy released by the flare .",

    "then the relation between the flare amplitude and the brightness variation amplitude can be written as @xmath63 this indicates that the upper limit of the flare amplitude is proportional to 1.5 power of the starspots area if we assume @xmath64 .",

    "+   +  some data points of superflares are located above the line of equation ( [ energy8 ] ) .",
    "this is explained by the two reasons discussed in the following .",
    "first , the inclination and latitude of the spots govern their projected area , and the size of the spot can not be uniquely determined because of these effects and the fixed contrast with the photosphere .",
    "lower inclinations cause a smaller projected spot area and/or the spot to be visible through most of the rotation period , and therefore lower brightness variations result in these cases .",
    "+   +  second , magnetic flux density ( @xmath40 ) is not necessarily constant . it is a function of the spot size .",
    "@xcite shows that the umbral continuum intensity of sunspots becomes weak as sunspots become large and that the intensity also becomes weak as the magnetic flux density gets strong .",
    "this fact means that as the spot becomes larger , the magnetic flux density becomes strong and the magnetic energy stored near the spot increases . as a result",
    ", the released flare energy tends to be bigger than that in the case of @xmath40=@xmath74 , and the straight lines in figure [ amp_sf_sun ] become steeper .",
    "+   +  in this paper , we showed that many of superflare - generating stars probably have large starspots , and the energy of superflares can be explained by the magnetic energy stored around such starspots .",
    "we also confirmed in section [ sec : period - ana - plot ] the stellar activity depends on the rotation period .",
    "stars with relatively slower rotation rates can still produce flares that are as energetic as those of more rapidly rotating stars , although the average flare frequency is lower for more slowly rotating stars .",
    "there are , however , many things to be left for consideration in the next step .",
    "for example , it is extremely important to know lifetime of starspot regions or how activity level changes because it is related to knowing how the starspot evolves by the dynamo mechanism .",
    "@xcite indicated that the magnetic energy to generate superflares can be produced by the effects of differential rotation .",
    "we need to investigate in detail the effects of differential rotation on the brightness variation .",
    "+   +  in addition , if superflares occur on the starspot area of a single star and the brightness variation is caused by the rotation , the timings when superflares occur are likely to have a phase dependence , since superflares which we can observe need to occur when the starspots are on the visible side of the star .",
    "this phase dependence , however , is expected not to be necessarily true .",
    "for some pairs of spot distribution on the stellar surface and stellar inclination angle , some part of the area covered by the starspots is always on the visible side of the star . in these cases , it is probable that superflare occurs in any phase of the differential rotation . we need to study these effects in detail in the next step ( cf.@xcite discuss these effects for one k - type star . ) .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the brightness variations of superflare - generating stars in kepler quarter 0 - 6 data by considering the signature of stellar rotation and the starspots .",
    "first , we performed simple spot model analyses for typical superflare - generating stars .",
    "many of the brightness variations with the period of one day to a few tens of days and the amplitude of 0.1 @xmath5 10% can be explained by the rotation of the star with fairly large starspots , taking into account the effects of the inclination angle and the spot latitude .",
    "next , using the result of the period analysis , we investigated the relations between the energy and frequency of superflares and the rotation period by assuming that the period of the brightness variation corresponds to the rotation period .",
    "stars with relatively slower rotation rates can still produce flares that are as energetic as those of more rapidly rotating stars , although the average flare frequency is lower for more slowly rotating stars .",
    "last , we discussed the relations between the starspot coverage and the energy of flares . if we assume that the brightness variations are due to the rotation , the energy of superflares can be explained by the magnetic energy stored near the large starspots . +   + we are grateful to prof .",
