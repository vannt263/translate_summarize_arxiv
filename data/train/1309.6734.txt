    "just after the big bang , the universe was composed of only h , he , and a small amount of light elements and its further chemical enrichment was provided by stars and supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the early history of the chemical enrichment is recorded in chemical abundance of long - lived low - mass stars that were formed in the early universe .",
    "such old stars show low heavy element ( metal ) abundances , thus being called metal - poor ( mp ) stars .",
    "a large number of candidates of mp stars have been discovered by several large survey programs ( e.g. , hk survey : @xcite ; hamburg / eso survey : @xcite ; segue survey : @xcite ) .",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopic observations of these candidates have been made to accurately determine their metallicities and detailed elemental abundances ( e.g. , @xcite , see also @xcite and the series for recent reviews ) .",
    "the first enrichment of heavy elements in the universe was provided by supernova ( sn ) explosions of population ( pop ) iii stars ( pop iii sne ) , which ejected synthesized metals .",
    "the next - generation stars formed from gases of mixture of the sn ejecta and pristine interstellar matter .",
    "metal abundance ratios in those second - generation stars directly reflect nucleosynthesis in the pop iii sne .",
    "the ejecta of subsequent sne overlapped with each other , from which later - generation stars formed .",
    "after many cycles of such star formation and sn explosions , the heavy elements from numerous sn ejecta were well - mixed in the interstellar gas and , eventually , the interstellar medium ( ism ) became chemically homogeneous .",
    "in the galactic halo , such a transition from the chemically inhomogeneous to homogeneous ism took place at [ fe / h ] @xmath2 , where the subscript @xmath3 refers to the solar value and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are abundances of elements a and b , respectively . ]  @xmath6 to @xmath7 as suggested from the changes in the abundance patterns of the mp stars , especially @xmath8-process elements , and the hierarchical chemical evolution models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in the inhomogeneous environment , chemical enrichment by a single sn dominates the preexisting metal contents ( e.g. , @xcite ) and [ fe / h ] of an mp star is not a time indicator but merely reflects [ fe / h ] of a cloud in which the mp star formed . a single sn enriches the ism roughly up to [ fe / h ]  @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thus , mp stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath9 , called extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars @xcite , are regarded to possess nucleosynthetic products of a few pop iii sne . inversely",
    ", comparisons between nucleosynthetic yields of pop iii sne and the abundance patterns of the emp stars constrain explosion properties of pop iii sne ( `` _ abundance profiling _ '' ) .",
    "asphericity and the explosion energy of pop iii sne are particularly important indicators obtained from such comparisons . to consistently reproduce [ @xmath10/fe ] and [ ( co ,  zn)/fe ] of emp stars",
    ", materials synthesized in the deep complete si - burning region ( including co and zn ) should be ejected but the amount of fe should not be too large relative to @xmath10 elements .",
    "this requirement is satisfied with taking into account aspherical effects such as the jet - like explosion @xcite or the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite .",
    "the aspherical explosion is mimicked by the mixing - and - fallback model that well - reproduces the abundance patterns of the emp stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the trends of increasing [ ( co ,  zn)/fe ] toward lower [ fe / h ] is shown to be explained if less - massive stars ( with main - sequence mass @xmath11 ) produce normal sne and more - massive stars ( with @xmath12 ) produce energetic explosions , i.e. , hypernovae @xcite .",
    "the asphericity and the dependence of explosion energy ( @xmath13 ) on @xmath14 are also seen in the nearby present day sne .",
    "their nebular spectra and polarization indicate aspherical distributions of elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath13 of the present day sne are constrained from their light curves and spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the above variations of the present day sne are consistent with the requirements for the variations of pop iii sne to reproduce the abundance patterns and the trends of emp stars .",
    "such a consistency suggests that the sn explosion mechanism may not be so sensitive to the metallicity .",
    "however , pop iii sn models for individual emp stars have been so far constructed only for a few emp stars which have interesting characteristics ( e.g. , @xcite ) . also , because of the lack of large samples of emp stars",
    ", it has not been possible to investigate the statistical properties of pop iii sne .",
    "recently the number of the emp stars increased dramatically as a result of the large mp star surveys , intensive follow - up high - dispersion spectroscopic observations , and the development of stellar abundance analysis methods .",
    "therefore , it has become feasible and necessary to statistically constrain the explosion properties of pop iii sne using the emp stars .    in this paper , we focus on the 48 most metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 including 41 halo stars and 7 stars in dwarf galaxies , and construct pop iii sn models to reproduce their abundance patterns . with reasonably successful models ,",
    "the abundance ratios of these emp stars can be directly related to the explosion properties of pop iii sne : the masses of ejected fe @xmath15 and the compact remnant @xmath16 . according to these relations",
    ", we derive the distributions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 of pop iii sne .",
    "these relations make it possible to extract information of pop iii sne without constructing sn models at the era that large samples of emp stars are available .",
    "we describe the model and procedure in   [ sec : model ] and present sn models in   [ sec : obs ] .",
    "after discussing the limitations of our approach in ",
    "[ sec : limit ] , the distributions of properties of pop iii sne are presented in   [ sec : dist ] .",
    "the paper is concluded with several discussion in   [ sec : discussion ] and remarks in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we adopt the @xmath17 progenitor models to construct pop iii sn models for all emp stars in a unified manner , and the @xmath18 progenitor model to investigate dependence on @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath17 progenitor models with a different mixing efficiency are taken from @xcite and the @xmath18 progenitor model is taken from @xcite as follows :    \\(1 ) model a is the @xmath17 progenitor without enhanced mixing ,    \\(2 ) model b is the @xmath17 progenitor with enhanced mixing , e.g. , due to rapid rotation ,    and    \\(3 ) model c is the @xmath18 progenitor without enhanced mixing .",
    "the difference due to the enhanced mixing prominently appears in the abundance of n that is synthesized via the cno cycle facilitated by the mixing of c in the he convective shell into the h - rich envelope .",
    "thus models a and c have a low n abundance , while model b has a high n abundance in the h layer ( figs .",
    "[ fig : presn]a-[fig : presn]c ) .",
    "the efficient mixing also considerably enhances the he abundance in the h layer .",
    "the progenitor models are summarized in table  [ tab : presn ] .",
    "we adopt explosion energies @xmath19 for models a and b , and @xmath20 for model c.    hydrodynamical and nucleosynthesis calculations are performed with the same method as in @xcite .",
    "the explosion is initiated by a thermal bomb and followed with the lagrangian code assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "the hydrodynamical calculation includes nuclear energy releases from the @xmath10-network and a realistic equation of state @xcite .",
    "the detailed nucleosynthesis calculation is performed as a post - processing @xcite with a reaction network including 280 isotopes up to @xmath21br ( table  1 in @xcite ) .    in order to take into account the aspherical effect",
    ", we apply the mixing - and - fallback model to the spherical calculations .",
    "the mixing - and - fallback model has three parameters characterizing the asphericity : the initial mass cut @xmath22 , the outer boundary of the mixing region @xmath23 , and the ejection factor @xmath24 ( appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "the mass of the compact remnant @xmath16 is derived as @xmath25 in the jet - induced explosion model , physical meanings of @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath16 are the inner boundary , the fraction of the solid angle of a region from which materials produced by incomplete si burning are ejected , and the remnant mass , respectively @xcite .",
    "an explosion with weak jets , i.e. , with low energy deposition rate , corresponds to an sn model with small @xmath24 and large @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the mixing - and - fallback model do not fully reproduce the enhanced abundance ratios [ ( sc , ti , co , zn)/fe ] obtained in the jet - induced explosion model .",
    "the enhancement stems from nucleosynthesis in a high - entropy environment which is realized by the concentration of energy in the narrow jet .",
    "thus , we adopt `` low - density '' modification as in @xcite to mimic the high - entropy environment , in which the density of the progenitor is artificially reduced by a factor of `` low - density '' factor @xmath26 without changing the mass of each lagrangian mass shell .",
    "furthermore , since the neutrino absorption during the explosion may largely change the @xmath27 distribution in the si burning layers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent review ) , which is not included in our explosion calculations , we modify @xmath27 profile to @xmath28 in the complete si burning region if [ co / fe ] of an sn model is underabundant and/or @xmath29 in the incomplete si burning region if [ mn / fe ] of an sn model is underabundant @xcite . because the explosion models with realistic geometry and the neutrino processes have not been established , these modifications to compare with the observed abundance ratios of many emp stars may provide useful constraints on the entropy and @xmath27 distribution in the realistic explosion models .",
    "we note that these two modifications do not affect on the distribution of @xmath15 and @xmath16 of pop iii sne (   [ sec : dist ] ) .",
    "hydrodynamical and thermodynamical features of sne appear in abundance ratios between elements synthesized in different layers and between elements synthesized in the same layer , respectively .",
    "it is important to determine abundances of elements as many as possible because different abundance ratios provide different information .",
    "we focus on the hydrodynamical features in this paper and select the 48 emp stars ( including a binary ) which have at least 3 determined abundance ratios to fe of the following elements : ( 1 ) c , n , or o , ( 2 ) mg , ( 3 ) ca , and ( 4 ) co or ni .",
    "they consist of 19 carbon - normal and nitrogen - normal emp stars including a binary system , 12 carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars , 6 nitrogen - enhanced metal - poor ( nemp ) stars , 2 ultra metal - poor ( ump ) star , and 2 hyper metal - poor ( hmp ) stars in galactic halo and 7 emp stars in dwarf galaxies .",
    "definitions of classification are described in respective subsections .",
    "the stars and references are summarized in table  [ tab : stars ] .",
    "since the theoretical model provides mass fractions of elements and isotopes , the theoretical sn yields should be compared with genuine abundance ratios taking into account non - lte ( nlte ) and 3d effects . however , the nlte or 3d effect has been estimated only for several mp stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 3d - nlte abundance ratios are currently not available for any stars .",
    "results could be systematically biased if we adopt 1d - lte abundance ratios . on the other hand , in order to investigate statistical nature of pop iii sne , it is requested to avoid including artificial scatter by adopting different stellar atmosphere models , i.e. , to derive abundance ratios with a uniform method .",
    "@xcite recently present homologous abundance analyses and discuss distribution of abundance ratios but this study is restricted within a framework of a 1d - lte assumption .    in this paper ,",
    "we adopt abundance ratios in @xcite and in other literatures which may take into account nlte or 3d effect ( table  [ tab : stars ] ) .",
    "the abundance patterns of the emp stars and the sn yields are normalized with the solar abundance ratios in @xcite .",
    "if there are plural references , we adopt their average [ fe / h ] .",
    "we construct an sn model to reproduce nlte or 3d corrected abundance ratios if the corrections specified for the individual emp star are available . if not , we construct an sn model to reproduce 1d - lte abundance ratios but also refer abundance ratios for which the following nlte correction is expediently applied :    * @xmath30 and [ fe / h]-dependent correction for [ na / fe ] ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , * @xmath31 for [ mg / fe ] @xcite , * @xmath32 , @xmath30 , and [ fe / h]-dependent correction for [ al / fe ] @xcite , * @xmath33 for [ k / fe ] @xcite , * @xmath34 for [ cr / fe ] derived from line(s ) @xcite , and * @xmath35 for [ mn / fe ] derived from resonance line(s ) @xcite .",
    "the corrections for [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] are estimated from the interpolation and extrapolation of the corrections given by in @xcite , and the average corrections are uniformly adopted for other elements .",

    "the assumption ( 2 ) could be of no matter if the mass of gas enriched by pop iii sne and the initial mass function of the next - generation stars do not depend on the metallicity at [ fe / h]@xmath0 .",
    "the 3d computations propose wide distribution of [ fe / h ] from @xmath219 to @xmath220 but the gas mass seems to slowly increase as a function of metallicity @xcite .",
    "the dependence of initial mass function on metallicity is under investigation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore the fragmentation mechanisms of clouds are still under debate ( fine - structure cooling , @xcite and dust - induced cooling , @xcite ) and it is recently suggested that low - mass stars can form even at @xmath119 by disk fragmentation @xcite .",
    "convolving the metallicity distribution of gas mass and the initial mass function with equations ( [ eq : mfe ] ) and ( [ eq : mrem ] ) gives realistic distribution of properties of pop iii sne through the comparison with the distribution of the abundance ratios of the emp stars .",
    "the sn models well reproduce the abundance patterns of most of emp stars .",
    "however , there are several difficult elements .",
    "( 1 ) : :    the high [ ( sc ,  ti)/fe ] of the emp stars require the high - entropy    environment in the explosion .",
    "the variation of    @xmath26 implies that pop iii sne are aspherical    explosions with different energy deposition rate and/or jet - opening    angle @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) : :    although the @xmath27 profile is modified referring    only [ ( mn ,  co)/fe ] in this paper , the abundance ratios of elements    synthesized in the complete si - burning layer could minutely constrain    the @xmath27 distribution in the innermost layer of    the sn ejecta . (",
    "3 ) : :    the ratio [ k / fe ] of the present sn models are not in agreement with    [ k / fe ] of all the emp stars .",
    "although the nlte effect on [ k / fe ] is    large at [ fe / h ]  @xmath309 to @xmath220 ( * ? ?",
    "* ;    * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the effect at low metallicity is not large enough to reconcile    the discrepancy .",
    "there are several suggestions to enhance [ k / fe ] .",
    "the    underproduction of k could be solved by nucleosynthesis in    @xmath48-rich ejecta which may be led by neutrino process    @xcite .",
    "we leave these issues in future investigation .",
    "the determination of the abundance ratios in the emp stars is suffered from the 3d - nlte effects and the difficult determination of the surface gravity .",
    "an impact on the abundance ratios varies depending on individual stars .",
    "the uncertainties of the abundance ratios make it difficult to minutely constrain properties of sn models . for example , the uncertainties for he  1300 + 0157 are as large as @xmath310  dex for [ ( c ,  o)/fe ] and @xmath311  dex for [ ( na ,  mg ,  al)/fe ] . such large uncertainties",
    "lead large ambiguities of @xmath15 by two orders of magnitude and @xmath16 by a factor of @xmath285 .",
    "the low [ @xmath10/fe ] for the surface gravity of a dwarf star can be reproduced even without the mixing - and - fallback process .",
    "we find that the progenitor mass can be constrained by the abundance ratios between the elements synthesized in the same layer .",
    "in particular , the accurate determination of the abundance ratios among na , mg , and al could contribute to the determination of the progenitor mass . we also indicate that the abundance of f is useful for the constraint on @xmath13 if n is enhanced in the progenitor and the n - rich layer experiences high temperature ( @xmath49  k ) during the shock propagation . however , we caution that it is still difficult to uniquely determine the progenitor mass and explosion energy with arbitrary choice of the mixing - and - fallback parameters because supernova nucleosynthesis also depends on the explosion geometry .",
    "2d or 3d explosion simulations tie the explosion geometry , the explosion energy , and the main - sequence mass , and help deriving physical insight on the central engine .",
    "furthermore , the abundance ratios in the progenitor strongly depends on mixing processes in the sn progenitor , which are required to be dealt with 3d computation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to adopt sn models with attention to these caveats .",
    "the number fraction of stars with low [ ( c+n)/fe ] in dwarf galaxies is larger than that in galactic halo and thus @xmath15 for the emp stars in dwarf galaxies is distributed to higher values than those in halo stars .",
    "we note that the smaller fraction of the emp stars with high [ ( c+n)/fe ] in dwarf galaxies is not explained by the observational bias .",
    "however , there are caveats that the number of emp stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 in dwarf galaxies are still small and that the abundance of n is not well constrained except for two stars .",
    "although this might stem from statistical scatter , if real , the pop iii sne in dwarf galaxies yield low [ @xmath10/fe ] which is consistent with the mp stars in dwarf galaxies at [ fe / h ]  @xmath231",
    ". this would be verified by future studies with increasing the number of emp stars in dwarf galaxies .    the chemical enrichment in dwarf galaxies",
    "is suggested to be inhomogeneous even at higher metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath231 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because the abundance ratios of mp stars in dwarf galaxies show large dispersion .",
    "the abundance patterns of stars formed in the inhomogeneous environment can reflect predominantly nucleosynthesis in a single sn even if the metallicity is high .",
    "indeed , the unusual abundance patterns of her-2 and her-3 stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath312 are reproduced by pop iii sn models with high explosion energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : her ] ) .",
    "if the inhomogeneity of ism is held at high metallicity , a larger number of stars can be applied to constrain the properties of pop iii sne in the dwarf galaxies .",
    "it is important to find out the transition period from inhomogeneous to homogeneous metal enrichment in dwarf galaxies .",
    "we construct the pop iii sn models reproducing the abundance patterns of the 48 emp stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 in the galactic halo and dwarf galaxies ( _ abundance profiling _ ) .",
    "we adopt the spherical explosion models in which the aspherical effects are taken into account as _ mixing - and - fallback_. according to the sn models , we reveal the correlations between the abundance ratios and the properties of pop iii sne and derive the fitting formulae of the relations : [ ( c+n)/fe ] vs. @xmath15 , and [ ( c+n)/mg ] vs. @xmath16 .",
    "this is enabled by the construction of pop iii sn models for numerous emp stars which is impossible to be executed with 2d or 3d simulations because of computational costs . with the use of these relations ,",
    "the distribution of the abundance ratios of the emp stars is projected to the distribution of @xmath15 and @xmath16 of pop iii sne .",
    "these clarify that the distribution of @xmath15 extends down to @xmath313 , which might imply that the pop iii sne tend to have smaller @xmath15 than the present day sne , and that the distribution of @xmath16 is as wide as @xmath307 which is consistent with the mass distribution of present day stellar - mass black holes .",
    "these demonstrate that the abundance profiling is a powerful tool to derive the properties of pop iii sne .",
    "the future surveys and follow - up observations can increase the number of emp stars at [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 and make it possible to more rigorously constrain the properties of pop iii sne .",
    "we emphasize the importance of the precise determination of the abundance ratios including the 3d - nlte effects and the stellar parameters .",
    "these are essential to constrain the properties of pop iii sne including @xmath13 and @xmath14 from the abundance pattern of individual emp stars by abundance profiling .",

    "<S> after the big bang nucleosynthesis , the first heavy element enrichment in the universe was made by a supernova ( sn ) explosion of a population ( pop ) iii star ( pop iii sn ) . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance ratios of elements produced from pop iii sne are recorded in abundance patterns of extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars . </S>",
    "<S> the observations of the increasing number of emp stars have made it possible to statistically constrain the explosion properties of pop iii sne . </S>",
    "<S> we present pop iii sn models whose nucleosynthesis yields well - reproduce individually the abundance patterns of 48 such metal - poor stars as [ fe / h ]  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we then derive relations between the abundance ratios of emp stars and certain explosion properties of pop iii sne : the higher [ ( c+n)/fe ] and [ ( c+n)/mg ] ratios correspond to the smaller ejected fe mass and the larger compact remnant mass , respectively . using these relations , the distributions of the abundance ratios of emp stars </S>",

    "<S> such distributions are compared with those of the explosion properties of present day sne : the distribution of the ejected fe mass of pop iii sne has the same peak as that of the present day sne but shows an extended tail down to @xmath1 , and the distribution of the mass of the compact remnant of pop iii sne is as wide as that of the present day stellar - mass black holes . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate the importance of large samples of emp stars obtained by ongoing and future emp star surveys and subsequent high - dispersion spectroscopic observations in clarifying the nature of pop iii sne in the early universe . </S>"
