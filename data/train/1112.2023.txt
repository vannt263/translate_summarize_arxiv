    "the main propose of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is to probe the thermal information of the dense thermalized matter which is named quark - gluon plasma ( qgp).the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the center of the collision is a kind of very clean information due to the real and virtual photons which do not interact strongly , therefore photons and dileptons can escape from the dense medium without strong interactions , and may carry the information of the center dynamics@xcite .",
    "however , so far no evident experiments show that some information is exactly produced from the thermalized medium@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 meson couples to the @xmath1 channel strongly , and the lifetime of @xmath0 meson is much shorter than the one of the expected hot hadronic gas .",
    "the yield of the @xmath0 mess spectrum may be modified in the hot medium due to the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the scenario of mass dropping or melting in a hot medium successfully interprets the dilepton yield enhancement in the low mass region at super proton synchrotron ( sps ) for pb - au 158 gev / a collisions@xcite .",
    "recently , the measurement of the dilepton continuum at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energies has been performed by the phenix experiments for au - au 200 gev / a collisions@xcite . the dilepton yield in the low mass range between 0.2 and 0.8 gev",
    "is enhanced by a factor of 2@xmath23 compared with the expectation from hadron decays .",
    "however , such a modifying scenario can not well explain the enhancement in the au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "the imperfect modifying models of hadron decays present other probable mechanisms to explain the enhancement of the dilepton yield at low mass .",
    "moreover , the dilepton enhancement at rhic is implied that such phenomena are related strongly to the hot plasma scenario .",
    "the contribution of thermal dileptons at the low mass is covered by the cocktail of hadron decays because the vector meson peaks is more pronounced than the thermal spectrum .",
    "the thermal information is dominant in the intermediate mass region between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 vector meson for the phase transition theory , but the contribution of dileptons in this region also can be explained by the decays of charmed mesons . the na60 collaboration has also observed an enhancement at intermediate mass .",
    "the data suggest that such an enhancement may include a thermal information and not just charm decays@xcite .    except for the above problems ,",
    "a new puzzle was performed by phenix collaboration @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 spectra of dileptons in @xmath6 collisions for different mass bins are in agreement with the expectation of the cocktail , charm decays and direct contributions .",
    "the agreement also exists in the au - au collisions at high @xmath5 ( @xmath7gev ) .",
    "the excess contribution above the cocktail and charm decays is consistent with the contribution from direct dileptons . in the soft region of @xmath8gev , pqcd is out of use , and the spectra are still higher than the expectation of cocktail and charm decays . if fitted with exponential in this soft window , one has a slope @xmath9mev , which is almost twice smaller than the typical slope of the standard thermal component .",
    "another candidate in the soft window is the new `` cold '' component which is still valid in the low @xmath5 region . in ref",
    "@xcite the authors suggest a new cold dilepton production mechanism which is not discussed in the standard theory list before .",
    "the semi - coherent two - photon processes are the so - called dilepton source for small mass bins and low @xmath5 .",
    "shuryak e. et .",
    "al . use the equivalent photon approximation to determine the differential cross section for the @xmath10 processes in au - au collisions , and have concluded that the semi - coherent production of dileptons does not contribute significantly to the phenix data@xcite .",
    "however , we derive the yield of dileptons for @xmath10 processes with the restriction @xmath11 , and finally find that the production of double photon interaction has a positive contribution to the cocktail and charm decays in the soft region .",
    "one notes that the impact parameter @xmath12 is smaller than the transverse dimension of the system @xmath13 , and that the dense hot medium can not be created in the heavy ion collisions if @xmath14 because the qgp is centrality dependent .",

    "after the macdonald approximation the above formulation can be written into a compact form as@xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 for au - au 200gev / a collisions at rhic . in this article we use the natural units , namely @xmath23 .",

    "if both the photon transverse momenta ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) are the same large ( non - coherent ) or small ( coherent ) , the total transverse momentum would have a very small value ( @xmath36 ) , then a dilepton could not obtain large transverse momentum in the @xmath37 interaction . the single track condition @xmath38gev allows us to discuss large transverse momentum dilepton production in the two - photon reaction , the contribution of non - coherent and coherent photon - photon processes is weak compared with the semi - coherent processes .",
