    "the recently discovered `` -loud '' binaries ( grlb ) form a new sub - class of galactic binary star systems which emit gev - tev s @xcite .",
    "these are high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxrb ) composed of a compact object ( a black hole or a neutron star ) orbiting a massive star .",
    "the detection of s with energies up to 10  tev from these systems shows that certain hmxrbs host powerful particle accelerators producing electrons and/or protons with energies above 10  tev .    at the moment it is not clear which physical process leads to the very high energy ( vhe ) particle acceleration and whether the vhe particle acceleration is a generic feature of the hmxrbs or the result of specific physical conditions in a restricted hmxrb sub - class .",
    "it is possible that particle acceleration is taking place in a large number of x - ray binaries , but the s can be detected only from the objects with preferred orientations w.r.t .",
    "the line of sight ( e.g. with jets pointing toward the observer ) @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it may be that the conventional accretion - powered binaries are not capable of accelerating particles and that the  activity of a binary is powered by a different mechanism ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical models of  activity of hmxrbs @xcite all assume  emission from the interaction of a relativistic outflow from the compact object ( jet from a black hole , or wide angle wind from a pulsar ) with the wind and radiation emitted by the companion massive star .",
    "the basic properties of the outflows , such as the composition ( e@xmath1e@xmath2 pairs or electron - nuclei plasma ) , anisotropy ( a collimated jet or a wide angle outflow ) etc .",
    "are as yet poorly constrained by the data .    in one of the three persistent ( periodic ) -loud binaries , psr b1259 - 63 ,",
    "the relativistic outflow is known to be produced by a young pulsar . in principle",
    ", a similar mechanism could power the activity of other sources ( except for cyg x-1 ) , although direct proof of the presence of the young pulsar in these systems is not possible : the radio emission from the compact object is free - free absorbed .",
    "recent puzzling detection of a short soft  flare from one of the -loud binaries , lsi + 61 303 @xcite , may indicate the presence of a neutron star in the system .",
    "the outflows from lsi + 61 303 and ls 5039 , extending to the distances @xmath3  cm ( far beyond the binary orbit ) are revealed by the radio observations @xcite .",
    "the nature of the outflows ( a collimated jet or a wide - angle outflow ) is still debated .    with the exception of cyg x-1 ,",
    "all the known grlbs have similar spectral energy distributions ( sed ) , peaking in the mev - gev energy band .",
    "the physical mechanism producing the mev - gev bump in the spectra is , however , not clear .",
    "the  emission from grlbs is supposed to come from internal and/or external shocks formed in the relativistic outflow either as a result of the development of intrinsic instabilities or through interactions with the stellar wind of the massive star",
    ". the mev - gev emission can be the synchrotron emission from electrons with energies much above tev @xcite , produced locally at the shock , or else , be produced via inverse compton scattering of the uv thermal emission from the massive star by electrons of the energies @xmath4  mev @xcite .",
    "the available multi - wavelength data do not constrain the composition of the relativistic wind from the compact object . on the one hand , the multi - tev or 10  mev electrons , responsible for the production of the mev - gev bump in the sed ,",
    "could be injected into the shock region from the e@xmath1e@xmath2 pairs loaded wind . on the other",
    ", these electrons could be secondary particles produced in e.g. proton - proton collisions , if the relativistic wind is proton - loaded . the only direct way to test",
    "if relativistic protons are present in the  emission region would be the detection of multi - tev neutrinos .",
    "the possibility of detection of neutrinos from grlbs by a km@xmath5-class neutrino telescopes was considered in several references @xcite .",
    "if the sources are assumed to be transparent to the tev s , the estimation of the neutrino flux is straightworward , given a known source  flux and spectrum .",
    "the assumption of source transparency was adopted e.g. in the estimates of the number of detected neutrinos as in ref .",
    "however , the tev  flux from the grlbs can be significantly attenuated by the pair production on the uv photon field of the massive star @xcite . in addition , if the s and neutrinos are produced close to the compact object , the  flux can be further suppressed by pair production on the soft photons emitted by the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the estimate of the neutrino flux and spectral characteristics based on the observed tev  emission is inconclusive due to the uncertain attenuation of the  flux in the tev band ( see @xcite for s specific discussion of ) .    in the absence of a direct relation between the characteristics of the observed tev  and the neutrino emission from a grlb , the only way to constrain possible neutrino signals from the source is via the detailed modelling of the broad - band spectrum of the source within the hadronic model of activity .",
    "the idea is that the pp interactions , which result in the production of neutrinos , also result in the production of e@xmath1e@xmath2 pairs and the subsequent release of their energy via synchrotron , inverse compton and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the electromagnetic emission from the secondary e@xmath1e@xmath2 pairs is readily detectable .",
    "the total power released in the pp interactions determines the overall luminosity of the emission from the secondary pairs .",
    "the known electromagnetic luminosity and broad - band spectral characteristics of the source can be used to constrain the power released in pp interactions as well as the spectrum of the primary high energy protons .    in the following",
    "we develop the hadronic model of activity of grlbs and derive the constraints on the spectrum and overall luminosity of neutrino emission from the analysis of the broad - band spectral characteristics of grlbs .",
    "although the following discussion is generically applicable for the grlbs as a class , we concentrate on the particular example of the  system , because it is the only known persistent grlb in the northern hemisphere , available for observations with the icecube neutrino telescope @xcite .",
    "the existing observational data are found to be consistent with a possible very strong neutrino emission from  ( with a flux at the level of @xmath6  erg/@xmath7s ) , close to the best reported amanda upper limit , @xmath8 ) @xcite ( a more recent reference @xcite combining more data reported a slightly degraded upper limit for  over approximately the same range of energy , while the sensitivity had been improved by roughly a factor two ; this however translates a non significant but large background fluctuation at the  source location ) .",
    "moreover , the assumption of an almost arbitrarily hard neutrino spectrum ( e.g. a powerlaw @xmath9 with index @xmath10 ) is not ruled out by the available multi - wavelength observational data .",
    "this means that , in principle , the soure could be readily detectable with icecube .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we describe the general features of the hadronic model of activity of grlbs . in particular",
    ", we stress that when the massive companion star is a be type star , the presence of a dense equatorial decretion disk around the massive star can boost the pp interaction rate . at the same time , the  emission from the pp interactions in the disk would be strongly suppressed , because of the large density of the soft photon background in the direct vicinity of the star . in section [ sec : numeric ] we perform the detailed numerical modeling of the broad - band spectra of grlbs in the hadronic model and show , on the particular example of , that the model provides a suitable explanation of the typical shape of the grlb seds .",
    "satisfactory fits to the observed seds can be achieved under quite arbitrary assumptions about the shape of the initial high energy proton spectrum . in particular",
    ", the initial spectra as different as an @xmath11 power law with a high energy cut - off and a monochromatic proton spectrum peaked at @xmath12pev energy could both explain the observed x - ray - to-  spectrum of the source .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : icecube ] we work out the predictions for the detection of neutrinos from  with icecube .",
    "we show that in an optimistic scenario , when the anisotropy of the neutrino emission of the source does not result in a suppression of the neutrino flux in the direction of the earth ,  should be detectable within a year of exposure .",
    "nevertheless , the spectral characteristics of the emission can only be marginally delineated after three years of exposure , given the wash out of the original neutrino spectrum from the measurement of the muon spectrum .",
    "in the hadronic model , the primary source of the system s high energy activity are high energy protons .",
    "the presence of the high energy protons in relativistic outflows from compact objects ( stellar mass and supermassive black holes , neutron stars ) is usually difficult to detect , because of their very low energy loss rates .",
    "for example , in the case of relativistic winds ejected by young pulsars , it is possible that most of the wind power is carried by the high energy protons or ions , but the presence of protons / ions in the wind can be established only indirectly , because most of the radiation detected from a nebula powered by the pulsar wind is emitted by electrons accelerated at the shock whose properties are determined by the parameters of the proton / ion component of the pulsar wind @xcite .",
    "emission initiated by interactions of the pulsar wind protons with the ambient medium can be detected only if the density of the medium is high enough @xcite .",
    "grlbs provide a unique opportunity to `` trace '' the presence of protons / ions in the relativistic outflows generated by compact objects .",
    "the dense matter and radiation environment created by the companion massive star provides abundant target material for the protons in the relativistic outflow .",
    "interactions of high energy protons with the ambient matter and radiation fields , created by the presence of a bright massive companion star , lead to the production and subsequent decays of pions .",
    "this results in the emission of neutrinos and s from the source and to the deposition of e@xmath1e@xmath2 pairs throughout the proton interaction region .",
    "radiative cooling of the secondary e@xmath1e@xmath2 pairs leads to the broad - band synchrotron and inverse compton emission from the source .",
    "if the primary high energy protons are produced close to the compact object , the maximal energies of particles accelerated in the region of the size @xmath13 in magnetic field @xmath14 , can be estimated as @xmath15\\left[\\frac{r_{\\rm c}}{10^{6}\\mbox { cm}}\\right]\\mbox { ev}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath16 characterizes the acceleration process efficiency . for example , in the case when the compact object is a rotation - powered neutron star , @xmath17  g , while @xmath18^{-2}$ ] , with @xmath19 being respectively the neutron star radius , angular velocity and rotation period .",
    "depending on the particular acceleration mechanism , the proton energy spectrum below this maximal energy can range from the conventional power law shape with spectral index close to @xmath20 ( acceleration in non - relativistic shocks ) , to almost monochromatic spectra ( if the acceleration proceeds in large scale electric fields in the magnetic reconnection regions of accretion flow , or in the vacuum gaps in black hole or pulsar magnetosphere ) .",
    "otherwise , protons can be accelerated via shock acceleration in an extended region of the size @xmath21 with magnetic field @xmath22 in a jet or in a shocked relativistic wind emitted by the compact object . in this case one",
    "expects a conventional @xmath11 type spectrum with a cut - off at the energy at which the larmor radius of the high energy particles becomes comparable to the size of the system @xmath23\\left[r_{\\rm ext}/10^{12}\\mbox { cm}\\right]\\mbox { ev}$ ] .",
    "efficient interaction of high energy protons with the radiation field produced by the bright massive star in the system ( e.g. a be star with temperature @xmath24  k in the case of  and psr b1259 - 63 ) occurs above @xmath25m_p\\simeq 2\\times 10^{16}\\left[\\epsilon_*/10\\mbox { ev}\\right]$ ]  ev , where @xmath26 is the typical photon energy of the stellar radiation .",
    "in contrast , high energy protons efficiently interact with the protons from the dense stellar wind already at much lower energies .    in the case of massive stars of type",
    "be , the pp interaction rate can be highly enhanced if the high energy protons are able to penetrate the dense equatorial disk known to surround them .",
    "an obstacle for the penetration of the high energy protons accelerated e.g. close to the compact object into the disk could be the presence of magnetic fields , which would deviate the proton trajectories away from the disk .",
    "however , the larmor radius of the highest energy protons , @xmath27\\left[b/1\\mbox { g}\\right]^{-1}$ ]  cm , could be comparable to the size of the system . thus ,",
    "if the magnetic field in the region of contact between the stellar wind and the relativistic outflow is not larger than several gauss , the highest energy protons can freely penetrate the dense stellar wind region .",
    "note that the same effect may also result in the production of very hard injection spectra of the high energy protons in the pp interaction region ( penetration of the lower energy protons into the dense stellar wind suppressed by the magnetic fields ) .",
    "the estimation of the pp interaction rate in the disk is straighforward , provided a known disk density profile .",
    "for example , in the case of the be star in the  system , the density profile of the equatorial disc has been measured , using the ir free - free and free - bound radiation ( see e.g. refs .",

    "since the details of the escape regime are not known , one can only compare ( [ tpp ] ) with possible relevant time scales .",

    "in the previous section we have shown that the hadronic model of activity of -loud binaries could provide a good fit to the broad - band spectra of these sources . within this model , the observed mev - gev bump in the spectral energy distribution is explained by the synchrotron emission from the secondary e@xmath1e@xmath2 pairs produced either in pp interactions or in result of @xmath88 pair production process .",
    "a direct test of the hadronic model would be the detection of neutrino flux from the known -loud binaries . in principle , the expected neutrino flux from a given source can be estimated from the known  flux . in the simplest case when the source is transparent to the s , the estimate is straightforward , because the normalization and spectrum of the  flux produced by the neutral pion decays in the source directly gives an estimate of the spectrum and normalization of the neutrino flux .",
    "however , modeling of the broad - band spectra of emission from -loud binaries , described in the previous section , shows that this simple possibility , most probably , does not hold .",
    "first , the spectrum of  emission in the tev band is affected by the @xmath88 pair production , so that neither the overall flux , nor the spectral index of the  emission are related to the ones of the neutrino spectrum .",
    "next , a sizable contribution to the spectrum of  emission in the tev band can be given by the ic emission from the secondary @xmath104 pairs produced in pp interactions .",
    "this further modifies the flux and the spectrum of tev  emission .",
    "thus , the information on the properties of the tev  emission from a -loud binary can not be used to estimate the neutrino flux from the source .",
    "surprisingly , the source flux in the mev - gev , rather than tev energy range can be used for the neutrino flux prediction .",
    "this possibility arises because within the hadronic model of activity , the mev - gev bump in the spectral energy distribution is produced by the emission from the secondary @xmath104 pairs from the pp interactions .",
    "contrary to the tev flux , the mev - gev flux from the -loud binary is not affected by the pair production and can be used to estimate the total energy output from the pp interactions in the source .",
    "the only uncertainty of such an estimate is that the synchrotron emission from the secondary @xmath104 pairs in the mev - gev energy band is , most probably , isotropic , while the neutrino and @xmath101 decay  emissions are not .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the observed source flux in the mev - gev band gives , in fact , an upper limit on the possible neutrino flux from the source .",
    "although the total power of the neutrino emission can be estimated from the mev - gev luminosity of the -loud binary , the modelling of the broad - band emission spectrum of the source gives only mild constraints on the neutrino emission spectrum : acceptable models of the broad - band spectra can be found assuming initial proton injection spectra ranging from a @xmath11 power law to an almost monochromatic injection spectrum .",
    "below we estimate the maximal neutrino event rate in icecube for a particular example of lsi + 61 303 , taking into account the uncertainty of the spectrum of neutrino emission from the source . in the most optimistic case scenario ,",
    "when the neutrino flux is at the level of the observed mev - gev flux from the source , we also investigate the possibility to measure the parameters of the neutrino spectrum ( and , therefore , of the primary proton spectrum ) , such as the spectral slope and/or the cut - off energy .    the rate of neutrino - induced muon events from a point source at declination @xmath105 with differential neutrino spectrum @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are respectively the neutrino and the muon effective areas of the detector .",

    "we have shown that the interactions of high energy protons ( with energies reaching @xmath12pev ) in the dense stellar wind can explain the observed broad - band emission , with the mev - gev `` bump '' of the sed being due to the synchrotron emission from the secondary @xmath104 pairs produced either in the decay of charged pions or resulting from the absorption of 10  gev - tev s on the thermal photons from the massive star ( see figs . 1 - 4 ) .",
    "although the observed bolometric luminosity of the source ( i.e. the height of the mev - gev bump of the sed ) constrains the overall neutrino luminosity , the shape of the neutrino spectrum and the overall normalization of the neutrino flux are only mildly constrained by the multi - wavelength data .",
    "the problem is that the properties of the broad - band emission from the secondary @xmath104 pairs are mostly determined by the effects of the radiative cooling and the escape of the pairs from the source , rather than by the initial injection spectrum of the pairs .",
    "this means that quite different injection spectra of the primary high energy protons ( and hence of the neutrinos ) can result in approximately the same broad - band seds , as is clear from figs . 1 - 4 .",
    "in addition , the anisotropy pattern of neutrino emission is expected to differ from that of the synchrotron emission from the @xmath104 pairs .",
    "this results in an uncertainty of the anisotropy - related suppression of the neutrino flux compared to the mev - gev synchrotron flux .    taking into account these uncertainties of the neutrino emission spectrum",

    "<S> we present a hadronic model of activity for galactic -loud binaries , in which the multi - tev neutrino flux from the source can be much higher and/or harder than the detected tev  flux . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the fact that most neutrinos are produced in pp interactions close to the bright massive star , in a region optically thick for the tev s. considering the specific example of , we derive upper bounds for neutrino fluxes from various proton injection spectra compatible with the observed multi - wavelength spectrum . at this upper level of neutrino emission , we demonstrate that icecube will not only detect this source at @xmath0 c.l . </S>",
    "<S> after one year of operation , but , after 3 years of exposure , will also collect a sample marginally sufficient to constrain the spectral characteristics of the neutrino signal , directly related to the underlying source acceleration mechanisms . </S>"
