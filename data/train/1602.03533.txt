    "according to all hydro - dynamical simulation for structure formation run in the framework of a @xmath8cdm cosmology , large concentrations of galaxies are the best tracers of the filamentary web of dark - matter that our local universe is made of .",
    "embedded into these filaments of shining ordinary matter ( stars in galaxies ) , should be hidden the , still to be found , largest reservoir of baryons in the local universe : the so called warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim : e.g cen & ostriker , 2006 ) .",
    "this , metal enriched ( through galaxy - igm feedback ) , otherwise primordial , medium should have temperatures in the range logt@xmath9 ( in k ) , and very low baryon densities @xmath10 @xmath11 . at such temperatures , h",
    "and he are mostly fully ionized ( and so very difficult to detect ) , and the most abundant metal , oxygen , is mainly present in its stable he - like form : ovii .",
    "the strongest bound - bound transition of the ovii ion is the k@xmath1 at @xmath12  , and should thus imprint absorption lines in the soft x - ray spectra of background objects whose lines of sight cross one or more whim filaments between us and the target .",
    "however , these lines are expected to be extremely weak .",
    "expected ovii column densities along a random line of sight crossing a whim filament , are n@xmath13_few_@xmath14 @xmath7 ( e.g. cen & fang , 2006 ) , giving rise to redshifted ovii k@xmath1 absorption lines with ew@xmath15 m . for these reasons detecting the whim",
    "has proven to be very challenging .",
    "the few detections so far , for the majority of the whim at logt@xmath16 , are either highly controversial ( e.g. nicastro et al .",
    ", 2005a , b ) , or single - line and low statistical significance ( e.g. mathur , weinberg & chen , 2003 , nicastro , 2010 , zappacosta , 2012 ) .",
    "perhaps the only exception that seemed to have gathered the largest consensus ( e.g. tananbaum et al . ,",
    "2014 ) despite the large - compared to typical whim expectations - ew and associated ovii column density reported by the authors ( ew=@xmath17 m ) , is the proposed detection of a single - line ( ovii k@xmath1 ) whim filament at the redshift of the sculptor wall , reported by buote et al .",
    "( 2009 : hereinafter b09 ) and fang et al .",
    "( 2010 : hereinafter f10 ) along the line of sight to the blazar h  2356 - 309 .",
    "recently , the same authors reported yet another evidence for a new ovii k@xmath1 whim absorber , again at @xmath18 , along the line of sight to the blazar mkn  501 ( ren , fang & buote , 2014 : hereinafter rfb14 ) .",
    "indeed , the ovii k@xmath1 resonant line shifts to @xmath19   at @xmath20 , a redshift consistent with both the @xmath21 and @xmath22 intervals at which the sculptor wall and the hercules supercluster cross the lines of sight to h  2356 - 309 and mkn  501 , respectively . for this reason",

    ", 2015 : hereinafter n15 ) , we present a systematic study of the cold and mildly ionized interstellar ( ism ) and circum - galactic ( cgm ) medium of our galaxy through the modeling of the oi k@xmath1 ( @xmath25  ) , oii k@xmath1 ( @xmath26  ) and oii k@xmath3 ( @xmath27  ) absorption lines imprinted by our galaxy s ism / cgm in the spectra of two distinct samples of galactic and extragalactic sources . in particular , the oii k@xmath3 transition , firstly identified by gatuzz et al . , ( 2013a , b ) , is the weak ( oscillator strength @xmath28 , behar , private communication ) @xmath29 inner shell transition of the n - like ( 7 electrons ) ion of oxygen .",
    "this line is hinted at in 9 of the 20 galactic x - ray binary ( xrb ) spectra and 8 out of the 29 agn spectra of the n15 sample , and has an average rest - frame wavelength of @xmath27  .",
    "the 8 agns of the n15 sample , in whose spectra the oii k@xmath3 absorption line is hinted at , include the two blazars h  2356 - 309 ( @xmath30 , jones et al . , 2009 ) and mkn  501 ( @xmath31 , falco et al . , 2000 ) ,",
    "for which the same line had been instead identified as intervening @xmath0 ovii k@xmath1 absorption tracing whim filaments ( b09 , f10 and rfb14 ) .    here",
    "we re - analyze all the available high resolution x - ray spectra of the two sightlines towards h  2356 - 309 and mkn  501 and demonstrate that , even for these two sightlines , the most likely identification of the @xmath32   line is indeed that of a @xmath2 oii k@xmath3 transition imprinted by a large amount of low - ionization metal medium ( limm ) that permeates the halo of our galaxy , at large distances from the galactic plane and perhaps up to the galaxy s cgm ( n15 ) .",
    "this , at least for the line of sight to h  2356 - 309 ( the only one for which both the k@xmath1 and k@xmath3 transitions of oii are detectables ) does not completely rule out a possible contribution , at exactly the same wavelengths , by redshifted ovii k@xmath1 , but dramatically limits it to an ovii column density more than ten times lower than that claimed by b09 and f10 .",
    "we reduced and analyzed archival hrc - letg and rgs data of the two blazars h  2356 - 309 and mkn  501 .",
    "the data of h  2356 - 309 include 11 hrc - letg observations and 9 xmm - rgs observations , while mkn  501 has only 6 xmm - rgs observations .",

    "the final spectra of our two targets total 193 ks ( mkn  501 , xmm - rgs ) , 649 ks ( h  2356 - 309 , xmm - rgs ) and 466 ks ( h  2356 - 309 , hrc - letg )",

    ", in ciao ( freeman , doe & siemignowska , 1999 ) to perform spectral fitting of the rgs and letg spectra of our targets , in the 6 - 30   ( rgs ) and 6 - 50   ( letg ) intervals , with the main aim to disentangle local ( i.e. @xmath2 ) absorption from our own galaxy s ism / cgm , from intervening absorption from putative whim filaments along the lines of sight to our two targets .    following the procedure described in n15 , we first modeled the continuum of our targets with a power - law ( model _ xspowerlaw _ in _ sherpa _ ) attenuated by neutral absorption ( the xspec - native model _ xstbabs _ in _ sherpa _ : wilms , allen & mccray , 2000 ) . the best - fitting pure - continuum statistics for our three spectra are @xmath33 ( letg spectrum of h  2356 - 309 ) , @xmath34 ( rgs1+rgs2 spectra of h  2356 - 309 ) and @xmath35 ( rgs1+rgs2 spectra of mkn  501 ) .",

    "this could simply reflect the fact that the photo - ionization - equilibrium models that we use are not a sufficiently accurate description of the gas physics , but it might also indicate that additional components are needed .",

    "<S> in this letter we demonstrate that the two claims of @xmath0 ovii k@xmath1 absorption lines from warm hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) along the lines of sight to the blazars h  2356 - 309 ( buote et al . , 2009 ; fang et al . , 2010 ) and mkn  501 ( ren , fang & buote , 2014 ) are likely misidentifications of the @xmath2 oii k@xmath3 line produced by a diffuse low - ionization metal medium in the galaxy s interstellar and circum - galactic mediums . </S>",
    "<S> we perform detailed modeling of all the available high signal - to - noise chandra letg and xmm - newton rgs spectra of h 2356 - 309 and mkn 501 and demonstrate that the @xmath0 whim absorption along these two sightlines is statistically not required . </S>",
    "<S> our results , however , do not rule out a small contribution from the @xmath0 ovii k@xmath1 absorber along the line of sight to h  2356 - 309 . in our model </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the putative @xmath4 whim filament is t@xmath5 k and the ovii column density is n@xmath6 @xmath7 , twenty times smaller than the ovii column density previously reported , and now more consistent with the expectations from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations .    </S>",
