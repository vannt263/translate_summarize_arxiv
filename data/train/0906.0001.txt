    "a compelling scenario for the particle nature of the dark matter , which in the standard model of cosmology makes up most of the matter content of the universe , is that of weakly interacting massive particles , or wimps @xcite . predicted in numerous and well - motivated extensions of the minimal ( particle physics ) standard model @xcite , wimps can naturally account for the cosmological dark matter abundance via standard thermal decoupling from the relativistic thermal bath in the early universe , a mechanism that predicts the relic abundance of electro - weak scale weakly interacting particles to be on the same order of magnitude as the critical density of the universe . within this framework , in today s cold and clumpy universe wimps should still pair annihilate , yielding as stable products energetic particles , including electrons , positrons , nuclei , anti - nuclei and gamma rays , that could provide _ indirect _ evidence for the particle nature of dark matter .    the detection of an increasing positron fraction as a function of energy reported by the pamela collaboration @xcite spurred a great deal of interest in the particle physics community as that is in principle one way in which the pair - annihilation of galactic wimps can manifest itself . while the `` positron excess '' might be ascribed to astrophysical sources , including as prime candidates nearby mature pulsars @xcite , the recent high - statistics fermi - lat data on the total electron - positron flux @xcite indicate that galactic wimp dark matter annihilation is still an open possibility @xcite , at least for some annihilation final states . in particular , for standard assumptions on galactic cosmic ray production and propagation , a class of dark matter models that give satisfactory fits to the available data appears to be one where the annihilation proceeds into such final states as @xmath0 or @xmath1 pairs , or multiple such pairs , with particle dark matter masses of the order of 1 - 3 tev @xcite .",
    "the required pair annihilation rate for such scenarios are rather large , exceeding by roughly three orders of magnitude what is expected from the above - mentioned thermal decoupling mechanism , i.e. a thermally averaged pair annihilation cross section times relative velocity , at zero temperature , of @xmath2 @xmath3/s .",
    "while particle physics scenarios have been envisioned that could account for both thermally produced dark matter _ and _ such large annihilation rates today @xcite , it was also pointed out that the annihilation of dark matter at high redshift is rather severely constrained by the resulting injected electromagnetic energy , be it in the form of extragalactic light from the first collapsed structures , or of distortions to the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background @xcite . in any case",
    ", if wimps are to explain the galactic positron excess , dark matter annihilation must , by definition , produce energetic ( multi - gev ) electrons and positrons . in turn , these light leptons will dominantly loose energy radiating synchrotron light in the presence of magnetic fields and by up - scattering intervening background photons , such as those in the cosmic microwave background ( inverse compton scattering ) .",
    "secondary radiation from electrons and positrons produced in dark matter annihilation yields a wide emission spectrum , that spans several decades of the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio frequencies all the way up to gamma rays with energies as large as the mass of the annihilating particle .",
    "indirect dark matter detection through its _ multi - wavelength _ manifestations has been discussed in a number of recent studies , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite for the galaxy , in ref .",
    "@xcite for local dwarf galaxies and in ref .",
    "@xcite for galaxy clusters .",
    "the importance of the inverse compton secondary emission was also recently emphasized for models that could explain with dark matter annihilation the pamela positron excess in ref .",

    "@xcite for decaying dark matter in the galaxy and at cosmological distances .    with the successful launch and initial science operations of the fermi gamma - ray space telescope @xcite , one of the most compelling ways to search for visible effects of wimp annihilation is via the detection of gev gamma rays resulting from particle annihilation in high - density regions @xcite .",
    "in particular , given the intrinsic survey - mode functionality of the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) , a promising dark matter detection channel relies on the study of the extragalactic gamma - ray flux , with the aim of detecting photons from dark matter annihilation at _ all red - shifts _ and in _ all dark - matter halos _",

    "the peak of this emission depends on both cosmology ( namely , the dark matter halo properties as a function of redshift and halo size ) as well as on the @xmath5 injection spectrum , and therefore on the particle dark matter mass and its annihilation modes into `` ordinary '' ( standard model ) particles .",
    "generically , the expectation is for the ic emission peak to appear anywhere between soft x - ray frequencies ( for light dark matter particles and annihilation final states producing soft @xmath5 spectra ) and multi - gev gamma - ray energies ( for heavy dark matter candidates pair - annihilating into final states producing a hard @xmath5 injection spectrum ) .",
    "interestingly , the location of the ic peak is roughly redshift independent , since the larger energy of high - redshift target cmb photons is exactly compensated by the redshifting of the ic - emitted photon from production to the observer .",
    "additionally , the ic all - redshift , all - halo emission has the obvious and yet intriguing property that the @xmath6 suppression in the electron equilibrium number density ( driven by a @xmath6 enhancement of the energy loss rate , dominated by ic and proportional to the cmb energy density ) is exactly compensated by the @xmath6 boost to the resulting ic emission ( which is also directly proportional to the energy density of the up - scattered photon field ) .",

    "we then present perhaps the main upshot of the present study in sec .",
    "[ sec : pamela ] , where we argue that a wide class of dark matter models that explain the pamela positron excess and are compatible with the fermi - lat @xmath5 data overproduce gev gamma rays via ic emission at all redshifts .",
    "the emission from cosmological dark matter annihilation into gamma - rays promptly produced in the annihilation event has been outlined and calculated in detail in ref .",
    "we refer the reader to that study for details .",
    "the emission can be cast as @xmath7 where @xmath8 indicates the differential number of gamma rays promptly produced in the annihilation of the mass @xmath9 wimp , @xmath10 is the redshift - dependent factor that encompasses the effect of structure in the dark matter distribution ( we will comment below on how this factor depends on assumptions on the redshift dependence of halo concentration and on the assumed halo density profile ) , @xmath11 is today s average dark matter density , @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath13 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath14 where we fix here the cosmological parameters to @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in the case of the ic emission , @xmath8 is replaced by the ( redshift - dependent ) ic emission function per wimp annihilation @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( in the equation above @xmath19 indicates the cosmic microwave background photon spectrum at redshift @xmath20 and energy @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the differential klein - nishina cross section formula ; for further details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and where we indicate with @xmath23 in the equation above , @xmath24 stands for the differential number of electrons plus positrons produced in a wimp annihilation event , and @xmath25 is the energy loss rate , dominated , at high redshifts , by the ic scattering off of cmb photons .",
    "notice that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqdist ] ) we ( i ) neglect diffusion , which is clearly irrelevant for the computation of the cosmological flux under consideration here , and ( ii ) we assume that electrons and positrons loose energy instantaneously , and therefore reach an equilibrium distribution at the same redshift at which they emit the ic radiation .",
    "this second approximation depends on the fact that at all @xmath5 energies and redshifts we consider here , the ic energy loss time scale , roughly @xmath26 , is much shorter than the hubble time at corresponding redshifts .",
    "it is therefore legitimate to neglect the effect of the expansion of the universe from the annihilation event that produces the high - energy @xmath5 to when these particles have reached the equiblibrium configuration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqdist ] ) and have ic - upscatteredd the intervening cmb photons .",
    "we neglect here synchrotron energy losses , whose contribution can be estimated as @xmath27 in principle , the average magnetic field is a function of redshift .",
    "assuming @xmath28 does not rapidly increase with redshift , synchrotron losses are entirely negligible at large redshift , say @xmath29 .",
    "taking as a nominal value for @xmath28 the average magnetic field observed in clusters of galaxies , @xmath30 , even at @xmath31 synchrotron losses are sub - dominant with respect to inverse compton .",
    "although most dark matter annihilation events will occur in high - density regions , the overall average magnetic field might be even smaller than its values in clusters of galaxies , and approach the extremely small values inferred for inter - galactic magnetic fields , @xmath32 ng .    in the calculation of the @xmath10 function we consider two extreme possibilities for the dark matter halo density profiles ( which we assume in all cases to have a universal profile over the entire halo mass range under consideration ) , namely the centrally steep moore profile @xmath33 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the centrally cored burkert profile @xmath34^{-1}$ ] of ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath35 indicates the radial distance from the center of the halo in units of the halo scale length .",
    "the moore profile assumption leads to large central density squared in all halos , and therefore to a large signal compared to the burkert profile .",
    "the widely employed setup of the navarro - frenk - white universal halo profile of ref .",
    "@xcite falls in between the two cases we consider here .",
    "we also attempt to bracket the uncertainty in the structure formation history by considering two alternative schemes for the redshift and halo - mass dependence of the halo concentration parameter described in ref .",
    "@xcite : specifically , we consider the bullock et al model of ref .",
    "@xcite and the eke , navarro and steinmetz ( ens ) scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite . for both models , we assume a fixed logarithmic interval cutoff for the smallest structure where the model predictions for the concentration parameter are extrapolated , and a cutoff scale of @xmath36 at @xmath37 ( see the discussion on this point in sec.iv of ref .",
    "we find that this choice ( as compared e.g. with the choice of a redshift - independent small - scale cutoff ) is however not critical .",
    "the bullock et al setup leads to ( i ) a steeper dependence of the concentration parameter on the halo mass ( see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , ( ii ) weighs more heavily structures at lower redshift and , in general , ( iii ) always produces a larger prediction than the ens setup for the total extragalactic light from dark matter annihilation . our reference setup in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] employs the bullock et al scheme and a universal moore profile .",
    "an important fact for the present calculation ( particularly for dark matter models with large masses ) is that the universe is not always transparent to high - energy radiation produced at high redshift .",
    "a prominent effect is high energy electron - positron pair - production and gamma rays produced at high redshift impinging on the intervening extragalactic background light ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we model this effect with the approximate exponential form of ref .",
    "@xcite , which in turn relies on the results presented in ref .  @xcite . at lower energies",
    "other processes also contribute to photon absorption ( but where negligible in the energy ranges considered by @xcite and @xcite ) , including photoionization and compton scattering .",
    "we model the photon transparency window according to a numerical interpolation of the results of fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    as we remarked in the introduction , the location in energy @xmath38 of the peak of the ic emission off of an impinging @xmath5 with an initial energy @xmath39 , which can be approximated as @xcite @xmath40 is approximately redshift - independent .",
    "in fact , indicating with @xmath41 the average energy of a cmb photon today , the ic up - scattered cmb photons at a redshift @xmath20 have an energy @xmath42 . those upscattered photons , though , will redshift from the redshift of production to @xmath37 by exactly the inverse factor @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the ic peak is roughly redshift - independent ( the actual shape of the emission at a given redshift is however affected by absorption and by the spectral shape of cmb photons at higher redshifts ) .",
    "as also pointed out above , there is no suppression of the ic emission at high redshift , since the @xmath44 increase in the energy losses , dominantly driven by ic scattering of cmb photons , is exactly compensated by an increase in the target photon energy density with redshift , and therefore an increase in the ic emission ( which is directly proportional to the energy density of target photons @xcite ) .",
    "notice that this is unlike the case of the all - redshift and all - halo _ radio _ emission @xcite , where there is no reason to expect that the effective radiation energy density in magnetic fields scales as rapidly with redshift as the cmb energy density . in turn , as remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , this implies an effective suppression of any contribution at redshifts @xmath45 for the extragalactic",
    "_ radio _ emission from dark matter annihilation .",
    "we will consider below the high energy extragalactic background at energies ranging from 1 kev , below which the x - ray background is dominated by galactic emission ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , through the egret measurements of the extragalactic gamma - ray background , which extends to energies as large as roughly 20 gev .",

    "the x - ray background peaks at somewhat higher energies , around 30 kev @xcite , where much of the background remains unresolved by current instruments . however , modeling based on the observed spectra and x - ray luminosity function at softer energies shows that unabsorbed and compton - thin agn account for roughly 75% of the x - ray background at the peak @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the x - ray background can be explained through the contribution of compton - thick agn @xcite , but the modeling of this component depends heavily on uncertainties in the fraction of compton - thick agn and their spectra @xcite . in the present work , we will neglect the contribution of compton - thick agn , but subtract the model for the contribution of unabsorbed and compton - thin agn described in ref .",

    ", however , we will conservatively consider the entire background in the mev and gev range and simply ( and conservatively ) require that the dark matter annihilation emission not overproduce the total observed extragalactic gamma - ray background .",

    "first , we notice that the break - up in redshift bands allows one to appreciate that while the gamma rays promptly produced in the final state ( we shall indicate these as fsgr , final state gamma rays ) produce a bump that , as expected , red - shifts to lower and lower energies the higher the redshift at which the annihilation occurs , this , for the reasons explained above in sec .",

    "we find a contribution which just below @xmath58 of the total .",
    "finally , in the high - mass case shown in the right panel it is clear that the contribution of annihilations at @xmath59 is entirely negligible to the fsgr , due to gamma - ray absorption on the extra - galactic background light , while annihilations at those redshifts significantly contribute to the ic emission .    in fig .",

    "the different injection spectra for these three final states drive the differences in the ic emission :    * in the @xmath53 case , the @xmath5 are almost solely produced by the decays of charged pions produced in the jet resulting from the high - energy final state heavy quark ; also , most of the fsgr are similarly produced by neutral pion decays * in the @xmath60 case , hadronic @xmath61 decay modes also yield a population of soft charged pions that produces the same bump ( although with a relatively suppressed intensity ) at @xmath55 kev as in the @xmath53 case .",
    "in addition to this bump , though , a second bump emerges at much higher energies , @xmath55 mev , that originates from the _ leptonic _ decay modes of the @xmath61 , yielding energetic @xmath5 ( for instance promptly from @xmath62 or from the subsequent decays into @xmath5 of muons and taus ) . *",

    "if fermi - lat resolves enough blazars to bring the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background down by an order of magnitude , this will start to put very significant constraints on this dark matter detection channel .",

    "an even stronger conclusion is reached by employing as an alternative the more conservative ens structure formation setup : the solid green line shows how our benchmark setup is affected by this choice , which amounts to suppressing the ic emission by a factor 2 - 3 , and the fsgr bump by an even larger factor ( the ens setup suppresses the contribution at low redshift compared to the bullock et al setup ) .",

    "an additional possibility is that the dark matter pair - annihilates into a light particle @xmath71 , which then decays into lepton pairs . this scenario has been shown to accomplish two tasks required for a viable dark matter interpretation of the pamela data : ( i )",
    "if @xmath71 is lighter than the proton mass , no antiprotons are produced in the dark matter annihilation even , in accord with the results of pamela reported in @xcite and ( ii ) the @xmath71 particle can be also responsible for a `` new force '' in the dark sector leading to a velocity - dependent enhancement that can explain the thermal relic abundance of dark matter as well as the large pair - annihilation rate in the galaxy today @xcite .",
    "we consider two examples of this class of models yielding cascading multiple lepton pairs ( see e.g. @xcite ) in panels ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the values of the masses and pair - annihilation rates for the @xmath72 ( c ) and @xmath73 channels are taken from ref .  @xcite .",
    "although injecting softer @xmath5 pairs and therefore featuring a relatively flatter ic peak emission appearing at lower energies , these models do not generically escape the overproduction of extragalactic ic gamma ray photons .",
    "a summary of the constraints from the all - redshift all - halo annihilation emission on dark matter models that could explain the pamela positron excess is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : msv ] .",
    "there we shade the regions of parameter space favored by a dark matter annihilation interpretation of the pamela ( cyan ) and fermi ( orange ) data , according to the procedure outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we show the lines corresponding to the constraints from the extragalactic dark matter annihilation emission : points above the solid black line are excluded for a bullock et al structure formation setup and a moore halo profile , while those above the dot - dashed line are ruled out even with the more conservative ens setup and burkert halo profile . specifically , the constraints correspond to models that overproduce the extragalactic gamma - ray flux by more than 2-@xmath74 for at least one of the egret bins . notice that the shape of the curves representing the constraints reflects the fact that for low masses , final state radiation and gamma - rays from the prompt dark matter annihilation event over - ride the ic emission , which becomes dominant at masses larger than 300 - 400 gev .",
    "for both final states the best fit region to both the pamela and fermi data is ruled out in the bullock et al plus moore setup , and even the most conservative scenario we consider here ( ens plus burkert ) rules out models with massive particles pair - annihilating into light leptons that could explain the pamela positron anomaly .",
    "notice that the statement we make here that models that explain the pamela excess are in tension with the all - redshift all - halo ic signal from dark matter annihilation is a particularly conservative one , given that in what we show above :    * we compared extragalactic background data with the emission from dark matter _ only _ , neglecting what are thought to be the most significant contributors to that extragalactic light , namely blazars ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; * the only case where the predicted emission from the models we consider are not directly in tension with data is for ( i ) the most conservative dark matter halo profiles and ( ii ) a very conservative structure formation setup ; * we neglected the ic contribution from background photons different from those in the cmb , which obviously enhances the total ic emission .",
    "noticeable examples are starlight and dust re - scattered starlight as well as the uv and ir backgrounds ; * electron - positron pairs produced in the gamma - ray absorption by the ebl can also , in principle , yield further emission ( for instance from non - thermal bremsstrahlung in regions with high gas densities ) that we have neglected , but that could add to the low - energy tail of the spectra we calculate here ; * we neglected the galactic dark matter emission , both prompt and from ic .",
    "as recently shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see e.g. their fig .  4 ) , the expected ic emission from annihilation in the galaxy for models that fit the pamela and fermi data is at the level of @xmath75 for @xmath76 gev , thus intermediate between the largest and smallest of the extragalactic signals we calculate here .",
    "the expected ic spectrum in the galactic emission case is harder than what we show here , due to the additional contribution of ic scattering off of starlight and dust - rescattered starlight .",
    "although this galactic emission will not be entirely isotropic , and issues might arise in disentangling a diffuse galactic background model from a strictly extragalactic isotropic component , the additional contribution from dark matter annihilation in the galaxy definitely reinforces the constraints we outline in the present study ; * finally , we neglected halo - dependent enhancement effects , including e.g. the so called sommerfeld enhancement that could significantly boost the contribution from small structures with low velocity dispersions    in short , we argue here that the ic emission from all redshifts provides a powerful probe to , and in many cases even rules out , the dark matter interpretation of the pamela positron excess .",
    "in this study we calculated the all - redshift , all - halo inverse compton emission from dark matter annihilation in addition to the corresponding final state gamma - ray emission .",
    "we outlined the available observational information and we articulated the dependence of that emission on both the dark matter particle model and on assumptions on the structure formation and halo density profiles .",
    "we argued that the unresolved extragalactic background light at x - ray frequencies provides a complementary handle on indirect dark matter detection to similar data at gamma - ray energies .",
    "in particular , the unresolved x - ray background rules out some low mass dark matter particle models with a conventional pair annihilation cross - section .",
    "the inverse compton emission is particularly relevant for models where the dark matter pair - annihilates into leptonic final states , including those models which have been recently invoked to explain the positron anomaly reported by pamela .",
    "we argued that those models are tightly constrained by the diffuse extragalactic light produced by the up - scattering of cosmic microwave background photons at all redshifts . in all but the most conservative halo profile and structure formation set - ups",
    ", these models overproduce the total extragalactic gamma - ray background , even before accounting for the contribution of blazars and other gamma - ray sources .",
    "these constraints will become increasingly powerful with the anticipated improvement in the understanding of the extragalactic background light expected soon with the fermi - lat data .",
    "the extragalactic diffuse emission is therefore yet another handle that fermi - lat provides to reveal the controversial origin of the anomalous excess of local high - energy positrons .",
