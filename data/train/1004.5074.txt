    "<S> _ evidence and evolution : the logic behind the science _ was published in @xcite by elliott sober . </S>",
    "<S> it examines the philosophical foundations of the statistical arguments used to evaluate hypotheses in evolutionary biology , based on simple examples and likelihood ratios . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty with reading the book from a statistician s perspective is the reluctance of the author to engage into model building and even less into parameter estimation . </S>",
    "<S> the first chapter nonetheless constitutes a splendid coverage of the most common statistical approaches to testing and model comparison , even though the advocation of the akaike information criterion against bayesian alternatives is rather forceful . </S>",
    "<S> the book also covers an examination of the  intelligent design \" arguments against the darwinian evolution theory , predictably if unnecessarily resorting to popperian arguments to correctly argue that the creationist perspective fails to predict anything . </S>",
    "<S> the following chapters cover the more relevant issues of assessing selection versus drift and of testing for the presence of a common ancestor . while remaining a philosophy treatise , _ evidence and evolution _ </S>",
    "<S> is written in a way that is accessible to laymen , if rather unusual from a statistician viewpoint , and the insight about testing issues gained from _ evidence and evolution _ makes it a worthwhile read .     </S>",
