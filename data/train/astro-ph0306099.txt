    "the rcb stars are a small group of hydrogen - deficient carbon - rich supergiants which undergo spectacular declines in brightness of up to 8 magnitudes at irregular intervals ( clayton 1996 ) .",
    "rcb star atmospheres are extremely deficient in hydrogen but very rich in carbon .",
    "dust is apparently forming within a couple of stellar radii of the stars , which have @xmath5  k. rcb stars are very rare .",
    "only about 35 are known in the galaxy ( clayton 1996 ) .",
    "their rarity may stem from the fact that they are in an extremely rapid phase of the evolution toward white dwarfs .",
    "understanding the rcb stars is a key test for any theory that aims to explain hydrogen deficiency in post - asymptotic giant branch stars .",
    "there are two major evolutionary models for the origin of rcb stars : the double degenerate and the final helium shell flash ( iben et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the former involves the merger of two white dwarfs , and in the latter a white dwarf / evolved planetary nebula ( pn ) central star is blown up to supergiant size by a final helium flash . in the final flash model",
    ", there is a close relationship between rcb stars and pn .",
    "this connection has recently become stronger , since the central stars of three old pn s ( sakurai s object , v605 aql and fg sge ) have been observed to undergo final - flash outbursts which transformed them from hot evolved central stars into cool giants with the spectral properties of rcb stars ( kerber et al . 1999 ; asplund et al .",
    "1999 ; clayton & de marco 1997 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "two of these stars , fg sge and sakurai s object are in an rcb - like phase at present .    during a decline ,",
    "a cloud of carbon - rich dust forms along the line of sight , eclipsing the photosphere , and revealing a rich emission - line spectrum made up primarily of neutral and singly ionized species .",
    "the emission lines suggest at least two temperature regimes ; a cool ( @xmath25000 k ) inner region likely to be the site of neutral and singly - ionized species producing a narrow - line spectrum , and a much hotter outer region indicated by the presence of broad emission lines such as c iii @xmath01909 , c iv @xmath01550 and he i @xmath01083010830 line is a triplet .",
    "the vacuum wavelengths of the triplet are 1.083206 , 1.083322 and 1.083331 .",
    "vacuum wavelengths are plotted in the figures .",
    "however , we will continue with tradition and refer to this as the he i @xmath010830 line . ]",
    "( wing et al . 1972 ; querci & querci 1978 ; zirin 1982 ; clayton et al . 1992 ; lawson et al . 1999 ) .",
    "other broad lines , such as na i d and ca ii h & k , imply a cooler region .",
    "the possible detection of c iv @xmath01550 implies the presence of a transition region with an electron temperature @xmath6 k ( jordan & linsky 1987 ) .",
    "but rcb stars do not exhibit a normal chromospheric spectrum so the presence of high excitation lines in the cool rcb stars has been perplexing .",
    "he i @xmath010830 was detected in r crb thirty years ago , when it was just below maximum light ( wing et al .",
    "1972 ; querci & querci 1978 ; zirin 1982 ) . the line showed a p - cygni profile with a violet displacement of more than 200 km @xmath7 .",
    "this line is similar to that measured for sakurai s object in its rcb - phase ( eyres et al .",
    "1999 ) . since 1978",
    ", the he i @xmath010830 line in r crb has been observed only once .",
    "it was seen strongly in emission while r crb was recovering from a deep decline in 1996 ( rao et al .",
    "no further observations of he i @xmath010830 in rcb stars exist in the literature .",
    "observations of he i @xmath010830 in ten rcb stars were obtained on 15 june 2001 at ukirt using the grating spectrometer cgs4 with the echelle grating and a 09 slit .",
    "the two - pixel resolution , matching the slit width , was 0.5   ( 14 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the stars were ratioed with comparison stars to remove telluric features .",
    "the flux calibrations were done using standards with colors from koornneef ( 1984 ) .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved using telluric absorption lines observed in the comparison stars .",
    "a quadratic fit was made to a selection of these lines covering the entire spectral range .",
    "the 1-@xmath8 wavelength uncertainty is 0.000005  0.000008 .",
    "the observed sample is listed in table 1 .",
    "the spectra , slightly smoothed to a resolution of 0.65   ( 18 km s@xmath1 ) , are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the rcb stars range in effective temperature from 5000 to 7000 k. their spectra have very different appearances depending on whether the rcb star is warm ( t@xmath9 = 60008000 k ) or cool ( t@xmath9 @xmath10 6000 k ) ( asplund et al . 2000 ) . in figure 1 , the warm star spectra are in the lefthand column and the cool star spectra in the righthand column .",
    "the warmer stars show mainly atomic absorptions of c i and singly ionized metals while the cooler stars , in addition , show strong c@xmath11 and cn absorption bands .",
    "see figure 2 .",
    "the line identifications are from hirai ( 1974 ) , and hinkle , wallace , & livingston ( 1995 ) .",
    "he  i @xmath010830 is present in the spectra of all of our sample stars . it varies significantly in strength and shape , from a fully developed p - cygni profile ( es aql ) to blue - shifted asymmetric absorptions with small emission components , to even more complex structures . in all cases , the line indicates a mass outflow - with a range of intensity and velocity . given the temperatures of the rcb stars , it might be expected that the photospheric component of he  i @xmath010830 would be small . however , absorption features of he  i @xmath05876 are present in several rcb stars at velocities consistent with a photospheric origin ( rao & lambert 1996 ; asplund et al .",
    "2000 ) . a photospheric component of the he  i @xmath010830 line is not clearly present in any star in our sample .",
    "the p - cygni - type line profiles in our sample were modeled to obtain quantitative information on the mass loss and the outflow velocity .",
    "a detailed discussion of the individual objects is given below .",
    "the results are compiled in table [ tab_seifit ] and shown in figures [ fig_seifit_es ] and [ fig_seifit ] .",
    "model profiles were computed with the sei ( `` sobolev plus exact integration '' ) code , orginally developed by lamers , cerruti - sola , & perinotto ( 1987 ) for wind lines of hot stars in the uv range , and subsequently extended to the analysis of h@xmath12 lines ( bianchi et al .",
    "the code calculates the source function with the escape probability method and the exact solution of the transfer equation .",
    "we follow the notation used by bianchi , vassiliadas , & dopita ( 1997 ) and bianchi et al .",
    "the velocity of the outflow increases outwards - following a law characterized by the exponent @xmath13 - until a terminal velocity (  ) is reached ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) of bianchi et al .",
    "2000 ) . in all profiles",
    "analyzed , we found a rather steep acceleration , with @xmath13 @xmath14 2 .",
    "terminal velocities are a few hundred km s@xmath1 . in many cases ,",
    "the profiles are complex and blend with other photospheric absorption lines particularly in the cooler rcb stars , making an accurate estimation of the parameters difficult . in figure 3",
    ", we show an example of a profile that can be fit very successfully using the sei method . we also show , in figure 4 , other profiles for which sei is successful . in some cases , the he i absorption trough appears to be almost saturated , making the method insensitive to the measurement of the total optical depth .",
    "several stars could not be fit successfully bacuse of saturated or complex absorption profiles .",
    "the optical depth values obtained from the sei analysis indicate column densities of the he i outflow higher than 10@xmath15 @xmath4 for all objects .",
    "es aql is the only member of the observed sample presenting a classical p - cygni profile .",
    "its he i @xmath010830 spectral region is affected by photospheric absorptions but much less than any other star in the sample .",
    "therefore , the location of the continuum and the fit of the he i line profile were rather accurate .",
    "the best fit profile is shown in figure [ fig_seifit_es ] and the corresponding parameters are given in table [ tab_seifit ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the total optical depth and terminal velocity (  ) were estimated by computing several profiles , varying the parameters around the best fit solution , and narrowing the range of acceptable solutions considering both the s / n of the observed profile and the uncertainty in the continuum location .    in ry sgr and r crb ,",
    "the he i absorption is much broader than the emission , unlike in a classical p - cygni profile .",
    "the he i line profile fit is affected by two photospheric lines , si i @xmath010830.1 and another line which may be a blend of s i @xmath010824.2 and cr i @xmath010824.6 ( see figure [ fig_seifit ] ) . the emission is partially masked by photospheric absorption .",
    "the derived parameters are much more uncertain in this case than for the pure p - cygni profile of es  aql .",
    "two acceptable fits are shown for ry sgr in figure [ fig_seifit ] - with widely varying exponents of the optical depth law .",
    "therefore , the optical depth remains very uncertain .",
    "wx cra and v517  oph have very similar he i line profiles . the flat bottoms of the absorptions indicate that the line is saturated and/or blended with other lines , both factors preventing an accurate measurement of its optical depth .",
    "the blue - shifted part of the absorptions and the extreme red wings of the emission are well fit by p - cygni profiles , provided a turbulence of about 20 - 30 % of the terminal velocity is included ( somewhat higher than the 10% value which is typical for radiation pressure winds of hot stars ) . for these cooler rcb stars ,",
    "many additional absorptions due to cn are obviously present , partially masking the emission .",
    "we nonetheless attempted to fit the blue wings of the absorptions to obtain an estimate of the wind velocities .",
    "although the line shapes are similar for these two stars , the velocity structures are different . the model profile adopted for wx  cra (  @xmath2225 km s@xmath1 )",
    "also fits the blue wing of the v517  oph (  @xmath2300 km s@xmath1 ) profile .",
    "however , the analysis indicates optical depths of @xmath16 @xmath171 , and velocities for the he i shells in the range found for other sample objects .",
    "the line profiles of sv  sge and u  aqr are also similar to each other , but in the spectrum of u  aqr the absorption is narrower , implying a lower outflow velocity .",
    "the line has a smaller displacement blueward than the previous cases .",
    "u aqr is located in the halo and has unusual abundances even for an rcb star ( bond , luck , & newman 1979 ) .",
    "the weakest he i features are seen in v854 cen , v cra and v482 cyg .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "the p - cygni profile is present in v cra with the si i line cutting through the middle of it .",
    "also , v482 cyg seems to have its absorption hiding in a broadened si i line .",
    "only v854 cen shows little or no absorption , although there may be a weak broad absorption which is very blue - shifted .",
    "the lower state of the he i @xmath010830 transition is 20 ev above the ground state .",
    "this state is metastable as its transition probability is very small ( a@xmath18=1.27 x 10@xmath19 s@xmath1 ) ( sasselov & lester 1994 ) .",
    "it can be populated by two mechanisms , photoionization / recombination or collisional excitation .",
    "he ii @xmath01640 is not seen in rcb stars ( clayton 1996 ; lawson et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this indicates that the he i @xmath010830 line is not being formed by helium photoionization and recombination ( rossano et al .",
    "rao et al . ( 1999 ) observed the he i lines in emission at 3889 , 5876 , 7065 and 10830 during the 1995 - 96 decline of r crb .",
    "the 5876   line was much weaker than the 3889 and 7065   lines .",
    "this can be explained if the lines are optically thick and the electron density is high .",
    "we can not calculate density since we only have data on the 10830 line but rao et al .",
    "estimate t @xmath2 20000 k and @xmath20 = 10@xmath2110@xmath3 @xmath22 . in this regime ,",
    "collisional excitation is important .",
    "it has been suggested that the he i @xmath010830 line seen in sakurai s object is the result of collisional excitation in shocked gas being dragged outward by the expanding dust cloud around the star ( eyres et al .",
    "1999 ; tyne et al .",
    "the dust formation and expansion by radiation pressure is thought to be quite similar in the rcb stars . in these fast - moving clouds",
    ", excitation might take place through atomic collisions or shocks ( feast 2001 ) .",
    "blue - shifted high velocity absorption features ( 100 - 400 km s@xmath1 ) have been seen from time to time in the broad - line emission spectra of rcb stars both early in declines and just before return to maximum light ( alexander et al . 1972 ; cottrell , lawson , & buchhorn 1990 ; clayton et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 , 1994 ; vanture & wallerstein 1995 ; rao & lambert 1997 ; goswami et al .",
    "the blue - shifted absorptions can be understood if the dust , once formed , is blown away from the star by radiation pressure , eventually dissipating and allowing the stellar photosphere to reappear .",
    "the gas is dragged along with the dust moving away from the star .",
    "the velocities seen in the p - cygni profiles agree well with those measured for the blue - shifted absorption features .",
    "there is a possible relationship between the lightcurve of an rcb star , which represents the mass - loss history of the star , and the he i @xmath010830 profile .",
    "the last column of table 1 lists the state of each rcb star when the he i spectra were obtained .",
    "none of the stars were in a deep decline but half of the stars ( v517 oph , wx cra , es aql , sv sge and u aqr ) were below maximum light and in the late stages of a decline .",
    "all of these stars show strong p - cygni or asymmetric blue - shifted profiles .",
    "in addition , both r crb and ry sgr , which show fairly strong profiles , had just recently returned to maximum light .",
    "two stars , v cra and v482 cyg , show weaker profiles .",
    "these stars had been continuously at maximum light for 800 and 1400 days , respectively , at the time the spectra were taken .",
    "v482 cyg , which had gone the longest without a decline , has the weakest he i feature in the sample .",
    "an exception to this trend is v854 cen .",
    "its spectrum shows no sign of he i except possibly a weak broad absorption . like r crb and ry sgr ,",
    "v854 cen was just out of a decline , so one might have predicted a strong profile .",
    "v854 cen is an unusual rcb star .",
    "it is extremely active . along with v cra , which also has a weak he i line , v854 cen is a member of the minority abundance group of the rcb stars , and has a relatively high hydrogen abundance ( asplund et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , helium is still the dominant element so it is not clear why the p - cygni profile is so weak in these stars .",
    "v482 cyg is not a member of this minority group .",
    "of the ten stars , only r crb has been measured in the he i @xmath010830 line at more than one epoch .",
    "in addition to the june 2001 observation reported here , it was also observed in march and may 1972 ( 6 mag below maximum light ) , january 1978 ( 1 mag below maximum light ) , july 1978 ( at maximum light for 100 days ) , and may 1996 ( 3.5 mag below maximum light ) ( wing et al . 1972 ; querci & querci 1978 , zirin 1982 , rao et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the he i @xmath010830 line is present at all four epochs .",
    "it is a p - cygni profile in january 1978 , a blue - shifted absorption in july 1978 , a strong emission line in may 1996 and a p - cygni profile in june 2001 .",
    "the value of  seems to be fairly constant at @xmath2200 - 240 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the p - cygni or asymmetric blue - shifted profile in r crb , at least , seems to be present at all times , whether the star is at maximum light or in decline .",
    "the he i @xmath010830 line is a key to understanding the evolution of rcb stars and the nature of their of mass - loss",
    ". the observed line profiles can help distinguish between the final flash and double degenerate models for the evolution of rcb stars . in the double degenerate scenario ,",
    "an rcb star is unlikely to be a binary ; thus the detection of a companion would favor the final flash scenario .",
    "rao et al . ( 1999 ) have made the suggestion that rcb stars are binaries and that the higher temperature lines are formed in an accretion disk wind around a white dwarf companion .",
    "they suggest that the he i lines may arise from the inner regions of the accretion disk while lower excitation lines such as the na i d lines would then arise in the outer parts of the disk .",
    "no evidence for binarity has ever been found in the rcb stars .",
    "if the rcb stars are single stars with mass - loss similar to sakurai s object , we expect to see p - cygni - type profiles , while if we are viewing an accretion disk directly , we expect to see pure emission lines .",
    "a third possibility exists where the accretion disk is seen through the material being lost by a cool companion . in this case",
    ", the profile would vary with orbital phase .    in",
    "these he i profiles , we can see the mass - loss from the rcb stars for the first time .",
    "it has long been suggested that when dust forms around an rcb star , radiation pressure accelerates the dust away from the star dragging the gas along with it .",
    "but until now , we have only been able to measure the dust .",
    "the he i @xmath010830 profiles measured here allow us to study the velocity structure and optical depth of the gas escaping from the star .",
    "we plan to monitor these stars to see how the column densities and velocities vary with time and how they are related to the dust formation episodes .",
