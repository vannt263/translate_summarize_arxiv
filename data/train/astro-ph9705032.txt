    "bars , or non - axisymmetric central light distributions , are found in about 2/3 of the disc galaxies in the present - day universe ( sellwood & wilkinson ) .",
    "mechanisms for bar formation have been explored quite extensively ( noguchi , , , shlosman & noguchi ) . as a result of cooling ,",
    "gas discs are subject to gravitational instability and bars can arise spontaneously . in galaxies of earlier types , due the stabilizing effect of the growing bulge , the disc is much less prone to spontaneous bar formation . a stronger perturbation is then needed , like an interaction with a companion , a merger or the tidal forces of a galaxy cluster .",
    "the bar will not last forever because it may dissolve when the core mass becomes important , and will contribute to the growth of the bulge ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that some bars are young , and that some bulges could contain relatively young stars .",
    "the fact that the heavy element abundance distribution is flatter in barred galaxies as compared with normal spirals of similar type can be explained by the action of inward and outward radial flows of interstellar gas induced by the non - axisymmetric potential of bars ( roberts et al . ; sellwood & wilkinson ; friedli et al . ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the slope of any pre - existing radial gaseous or stellar abundance gradient decreases with time .",
    "the long term effect is such that the stronger the bar is , the flatter the abundance gradient becomes with time ( friedli & benz ) .",
    "the finding by martin & roy of a relationship between the slopes of the global abundance gradient and the strength of bars provides support for the scenario of recently formed bars ( roy ) .",
    "thus bars may not necessarily be primordial features ( combes & elmegreen ) , but could also form at any time during the lifetime of a galaxy ( friedli & benz ; martinet ; martin & roy ) .    in late - type galaxies ( sbc , sbb ) , a young bar ( @xmath101 gyr ) will be characterized as being a gas - rich structure .",
    "such bars can be the site of vigorous star formation ; if the star formation process is not inhibited by the high cloud velocities , the radial abundance distribution will present a steep inner gradient ( homogenizing effects being compensated by chemical enrichment due to vigorous star formation ) , combined with a flatter gradient beyond corotation due to dilution by the outward radial flows , as shown by friedli et al . and friedli & benz . on the other hand ,",
    "if the level of star formation in the bar is modest or absent due to inhibiting forces , the radial abundance gradient would be weak both in the bar and in the disc . in both cases , with young bars",
    ", one should see breaks in the radial abundance distribution , which move outward in the disc as times evolves .",
    "some bulges , because they result in part from the stars in the bar being scattered out of the galaxy plane , should be polluted by ` young ' stars aged between 0.5 and 1.0 gyr . although one can not exclude the presence of young stars in bulges , they are very difficult to detect .",
    "the interstellar gas is a better laboratory to search for young bars .",
    "the best candidate found so far for a galaxy with a young bar is ngc 3359 where martin & roy have observed an abrupt o / h gradient in the central region ( which has an intense episode of star formation ) , and a flat gradient beyond corotation .",
    "ngc 3319 , observed by zaritsky et al . , appears to be a case similar to ngc 3359 .    in this paper",
    "we wish to explore the o / h radial distribution in the prominent southern bar galaxy ngc 1365 in order to test the scenario of recent bar formation .",
    "ngc 1365 is as close to an archetype barred galaxy as one can find in the nearby universe .",
    "its bar is very rich in gas and it has moderate star forming activity .",
    "ngc 1365 , a dominant galaxy of the fornax cluster , is probably the most spectacular of the nearby barred galaxies .",
    "classified as sb(s)b i - ii by de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( rc3 ) , it has a seyfert 1.5 type nucleus and a ` hot spot ' nuclear region ( sersic & pastoriza ; anatharamaiah et al . ;",
    "sandqvist et al . ) . a distance for ngc 1365 of 18 mpc , as recently determined by a hst - wfpc2 cepheid study @xcite ,",
    "is adopted .",
    "the galaxy has clearly defined offset dust lanes on the leading edge of the bar and along its two main spiral arms .",
    "a velocity jump has been observed across the eastern and western dust lanes ( @xcite ) indicative of strong shocks in the gas flow ( athanassoula ) .",
    "the general properties of ngc 1365 are listed in table 1 .",
    ".global properties of ngc 1365 [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "the presence of a break in the radial abundance distribution is one outstanding signature that a bar may have recently ( @xmath10 1 gyr ) formed in a spiral galaxy .",
    "following friedli et al . and",
    "friedli & benz who have developed this scenario , two breaks may actually appear in the radial abundance distribution : ( i ) a `` steep - shallow '' break , near corotation , due to vigorous enrichment by star formation in the bar , followed by a much flatter portion dominated by the dilution effect of the outward flow , and ( ii ) an outer `` shallow - steep '' break defining where the outflow has had time to penetrate the outer disc .",
    "this `` shallow - steep '' outer break moves to larger radius as time evolves , and as the extent of the radial homogenization reaches further out in the disc ( friedli et al . ; friedli & benz ) . as the bar ages",
    ", it dissolves and runs out of gas .",
    "star formation then weakens , and dilution effects in the interstellar gas come to dominate ; after a few gyr , the resultant global abundance gradient ends up shallow , the break becomes indistinguishable and the gradient displays a monotonic decrease .",
    "the slope of any pre - existing radial gaseous or stellar abundance gradient decreases from the start of the first phase . to have a break",
    ", one needs vigorous star formation in the bar , and grand design spiral arms for strong outward flows .",
    "ngc 1365 is a barred galaxy with moderate star formation along the bar but an intense nuclear starburst ( seyfert nucleus and ring of h  ii  regions ) ; this is evidence for an age of @xmath111 gyr ( see discussion in martin & roy ) .",
    "a `` steep - shallow '' inner break is found in the abundance distribution of ngc 1365 and it is located quite a bit further out than the corotation radius ( figure 5 ) . it is assumed that due to an interaction or a merger , the disc of ngc 1365 became unstable and developed a bar in a recent epoch . on account of angular momentum transfer via the arms , the bar induced large - scale radial flows of interstellar gas .",
    "first , a quick phase of intense star formation occured along the bar major axis as well as along spiral arms ; galaxies showing this property ( e.g. ngc 3359 ) have rather young bars . at a later time",
    "( closer to our epoch ) , a starburst was triggered when gas had collapsed to the centre in a nuclear ring as observed by sandqvist et al . .",
    "star formation now continues mainly along the spiral arms .",
    "with the fuel progressively consumed , star formation is essentially limited to the ring and the spiral arms .",
    "thus in this framework of a recently formed bar , ngc 1365 would be a disc spiral with a strong , gas rich , but moderately young bar ( age @xmath111 gyr ) . as indicated by the absence of a rich population of h  ii  regions in the bar ,",
    "the star formation rate is now weak , except in the center and at the bar ends .    from the neutral hydrogen kinematics ,",
    "corotation ( at @xmath12 or at @xmath13 ) is at 1.21 times the bar semi - major axis ( see linblad , linblad & athanassoula .",
    "there is a clear break in the o / h abundance radial distribution at @xmath14 or @xmath15 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "although there is some uncertainties ( @xmath16 ) in the locations of corotation and of resonances ( dependence on the model ) and of the break , the latter is beyond corotation ; the break in the o / h gradient is close to the -4/1 resonance at @xmath17 .",
    "the position of the abundance gradient break @xmath18 beyond corotation is puzzling , since this is a region of strong radial mixing .",
    "however mixing always competes with enrichment due to star formation in changing the local abundance .",
    "the intense star forming activity in ngc 1365 observed at the bar ends and just beyond ( betrayed by clumps of several bright h  ii  regions ) may compensate dilution and maintain high abundances , pushing the location of the break further where star formation is reduced .",
    "the apparent dispersion of the o / h points , at a fixed radius , does not vary with galactocentric distance .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the behavior of another barred galaxy , ngc 3359 , which has also a break in its radial abundance distribution ( see fig .",
    "ngc 3359 has vigorous star formation in its bar and a steep inner abundance gradient ; there the break is observed at corotation .",
    "the abundance fluctuations , at a fixed radius , are much larger in the outer parts of the disc  where the gradient is flat  than in the inner regions where the gradient is steep . martin & roy have interpreted this behavior of the o / h abundances in ngc 3559 as due to a recently formed bar @xmath11400 myr old , an age less than the mean azimuthal mixing time in galaxy discs @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the homogenizing action of the bar in ngc 1365 may have acted on a timescale longer than the characteristic azimuthal mixing time , that is the bar is older than 500 myr .",
    "the high mass of gas accumulated in the centre , as implied by the presence of a nuclear starburst and a seyfert nucleus , also indicates an age @xmath9 1 gyr for the bar of ngc 1365 .",
    "overall , several features are consistent with a bar formed about 1 gyr ago .    in figure 6 ,",
    "the abundance gradients of four galaxies which have had extensive spectrophotometry across their discs are shown : two normal spiral galaxies , ngc 2997 ( walsh & roy ) and m 101 ( kennicutt & garnett ) ; two barred galaxies , ngc 3359 ( martin & roy ) and ngc 1365 ( this work ) . the shallower gradients and the presence of breaks in the radial abundance distribution is easily seen in the two barred galaxies .",
    "the difference between barred and normal spirals in radial abundance distributions is striking . if the recently formed bar hypothesis is correct , the numerical simulation of friedli et al .",
    "of a disc with a recently formed bar and star formation show that the pre - bar o / h radial distribution in ngc 1365 would have been very similar to that observed nowadays in m  101 .    finally , the models of friedli and collaborators predict two breaks in the radial abundance distribution of galaxies with young bars .",
    "so far no observational evidence for the `` shallow - steep '' break in the outer disc has been found . in order to ascertain the scenario of secular evolution of disc galaxies ( martinet ) , by the recurrent action of bars",
    ", it will be necessary to find this outer break .",
    "this more definite test of the `` young bar '' hypothesis appears to be difficult however . as gas density falls with radial distance and the star formation rate weakens ,",
    "there are fewer and smaller h  ii  regions , not unlike the interarm h  ii  regions .",
    "long integration times will be required in order to determine o / h abundances and there may be only a few galaxies having a sufficient number of outer h  ii  regions to provide statistically significant samples .    *",
