    "one of the central themes in extremal graph theory is the study of sufficient conditions which imply that a graph @xmath0 contains a copy of a particular graph @xmath7 .",
    "two main interesting cases of this problem are when @xmath7 has fixed order , and when it has size comparable or the same as graph @xmath0 .",
    "the celebrated erds - stone theorem @xcite settled the first case , showing that sufficiently large graph @xmath0 of @xmath8 vertices and more than @xmath16 edges contains a copy of any @xmath9-chromatic graph @xmath7 of fixed order .    in the second case ,",
    "when the order of @xmath7 is close to the order of @xmath0 , the large number of edges is no longer sufficient to embed @xmath7 because there might be isolated vertices in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we need a lower bound on the minimum degree of @xmath0 .",
    "the most well - known example of such a result is dirac s theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which says that , if @xmath0 is a graph on @xmath8 vertices with minimum degree at least @xmath17 then @xmath0 contains a hamilton cycle .",
    "another example is a problem of packing vertex disjoint copies of a fixed graph @xmath13 in @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 contains a perfect @xmath13-packing if there are vertex disjoint copies of @xmath13 that cover all the vertices of @xmath0 . for convenience",
    ", we may assume that the order of @xmath0 is divisible by the order of @xmath13 .",
    "a classical theorem of hajnal and szemerdi @xcite states that if @xmath0 has minimum degree at least @xmath18 then @xmath0 contains a perfect packing of complete graphs @xmath19 .",
    "more general packing problems have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-th power of a graph @xmath0 is the graph @xmath20 obtained from @xmath0 by connecting every pair of vertices which have distance at most @xmath9 in @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , note that the @xmath21-st power of the @xmath8-cycle contains @xmath22 vertex disjoint copies of @xmath19 .",
    "psa and seymour @xcite proposed a common generalization of dirac s and hajnal - szemerdi s theorem .",
    "they conjectured that the same minimum degree bound @xmath23 will force a graph @xmath0 to have the @xmath21-st power of a hamiltonian cycle in it .",
    "this conjecture has been open for quite a while until komls , srkzy , and szemerdi @xcite proved it for large enough @xmath8 .",
    "they used a combination of szemerdi regularity lemma @xcite and the so - called blow - up lemma @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this technique in more detail later in the paper .",
    "the above results might suggest that if @xmath0 has minimum degree at least @xmath24 , then it contains a copy of any @xmath8-vertex @xmath9-chromatic graph @xmath7 with bounded degree .",
    "however , the following example ( see , @xcite ) shows that some restrictions are necessary .",
    "let @xmath7 be a random bipartite graph with bounded maximum degree and parts of size @xmath25 and @xmath0 be a graph formed by two cliques each of size @xmath26 which share @xmath27 vertices ( for some small fixed @xmath28 ) .",
    "assume that @xmath7 is embedded into @xmath0 and look at the @xmath29 vertices which come from one of the cliques and do not belong to their intersection .",
    "the only neighbors of these vertices in @xmath0 are the @xmath27 vertices in the intersection .",
    "but with high probability @xmath7 contains no collection of @xmath30 vertices which have at most @xmath27 neighbors .",
    "therefore we can not embed @xmath7 into @xmath0 .    thus to find a general theorem , we need some additional restriction on the graph @xmath7 .",
    "a graph @xmath7 is said to have _ bandwidth _ at most @xmath1 , if there exists a labeling of the vertices by @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 whenever @xmath33 forms an edge .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 if @xmath1 is the minimum integer such that @xmath7 has bandwidth at most @xmath1 .",
    "bollobs and komls @xcite conjectured that if @xmath7 is an @xmath9-chromatic graph which has bounded degree and low enough bandwidth then one can embed it into a graph @xmath0 with minimum degree at least @xmath24 .",
    "note that the constant @xmath35 is the best constant we can expect for such an embedding result to hold .",
    "indeed , assume that @xmath8 is divisible by @xmath9 and let @xmath0 be the complete @xmath9-partite graph on @xmath8 vertices whose partition classes are of size @xmath36 .",
    "this graph has minimum degree @xmath37 .",
    "consider the graph @xmath7 consisting of @xmath38 vertex disjoint copies of @xmath19 .",
    "it is clear that each copy of @xmath19 must contain at least one vertex from each class of @xmath0 and thus there can only be at most @xmath39 such copies in @xmath0 .",
    "thus we can not embed @xmath7 into @xmath0 .",
    "bollobs and komls conjecture has been recently proved by bttcher , schacht , and taraz @xcite , @xcite : for every positive @xmath40 , there exists @xmath6 such that if @xmath7 is an @xmath8-vertex @xmath9-chromatic graph with maximum degree at most @xmath10 and bandwidth at most @xmath11 , then any graph @xmath0 on @xmath8 vertices with minimum degree at least @xmath41 contains a copy of @xmath7 for large enough @xmath8 ( we will refer to this conjecture and theorem as the bandwidth conjecture and the bandwidth theorem from now on ) .",
    "there are a lot of graphs @xmath7 satisfying the condition above .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath9-th powers of cycles which have bandwidth @xmath42 , trees with constant maximum degree which have bandwidth at most @xmath43 @xcite , and @xmath44 by @xmath44 square grids which have bandwidth @xmath45 are a few of those . for more examples ,",
    "see bttcher , pruessmann , taraz , and wrfl s @xcite classification of bounded degree graphs with sublinear bandwidth .",
    "moreover , the theorem proved in @xcite is a strengthening of the bandwidth conjecture and also implies dirac s theorem and psa - seymour s conjecture asymptotically .",
    "most of the above mentioned results can also be viewed in the framework of _ resilience _ which we discuss next .",
    "a graph property is called _ monotone increasing ( decreasing ) _ if it is preserved under edge addition ( deletion ) . following @xcite ,",
    "we define :         note that the size of the set @xmath47 is now @xmath48 compared to a constant in the random graph case .",
    "this subtlety slightly affects the proof of theorem [ thm_pseudomainthm ] , and that is why we now need a vertex with independent neighborhood in every interval of length @xmath49 instead of @xmath50 as in the random graph case ( see the statement of theorem [ thm_pseudomainthm ] ) .",
    "the proof of lemma [ lemma_lemmaforgpseudo ] is almost identical to the proof of lemma [ lemma_lemmaforg ] .",
    "however , in order to apply the same argument , we need lemmas corresponding to lemma [ lemma_reducedgraphmindegree ] and lemma [ lemma_badset ] for pseudorandom graphs .        in particular , if @xmath0 is a @xmath51-graph for @xmath55 and @xmath56 as in theorem [ thm_pseudomainthm ] , then for linear size sets @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 .",
    "the following lemmas are a pseudorandom graph version of lemma [ lemma_reducedgraphmindegree ] and lemma [ lemma_badset ] .",
    "[ lemma_reducedgraphmindegreepseudo ] let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be fixed .",
    "there exists @xmath61 such that for all @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the following holds . given a @xmath51-graph @xmath0 with @xmath64 and @xmath56 ,",
    "let @xmath65 be a pure @xmath66-regular partition of a subgraph @xmath67 , and @xmath68 be its reduced graph .",
    "for large enough @xmath8 , if @xmath69 has minimum degree at least @xmath70 , then @xmath68 has minimum degree at least @xmath71 .",
    "[ lemma_badsetpseudo ] let @xmath74 be fixed and @xmath75 be an integer .",
    "then for every @xmath76 , there exists a constant @xmath77 such that any @xmath51-graph @xmath0 with @xmath64 and @xmath78 satisfies the following . for arbitrary subsets @xmath79 of the vertex set @xmath80 with @xmath81 for all @xmath82 ,",
    "there exists a set @xmath47 of size at most @xmath48 such that for all @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 $ ] for all @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "fix an index @xmath88 and let @xmath89 be the collection of vertices which have degree greater than @xmath90 in @xmath91 .",
    "assume that @xmath92 . by discarding some of the vertices",
    ", we may assume that @xmath93 .",
    "then by how we chose @xmath89 , and lemma [ lemma_pseudoedgedistribution ] , and @xmath94 , @xmath95 on the other hand , by lemma [ lemma_pseudoedgedistribution ] , we have , @xmath96 thus by combining these two bounds we get @xmath97 . recall that @xmath93 , and hence this give @xmath98 which is a contradiction . by the definition of @xmath89",
    ", this shows that there are at most @xmath99 vertices which have degree greater than @xmath90 in @xmath91 .",
    "same estimate holds for the vertices which have degree less than @xmath100 in @xmath91 and for other indices as well .",
    "therefore , the total number of vertices which does not satisfy @xmath84 $ ] for at least one index @xmath88 is at most @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 and this concludes the proof .",
    "we omit the proof of lemma [ lemma_lemmaforgpseudo ] and the deduction of theorem [ thm_pseudomainthm ] from it . to prove lemma [ lemma_lemmaforgpseudo ]",
    ", one should notice that in the proof of lemma for g ( lemma [ lemma_lemmaforg ] ) , once we apply lemma [ lemma_reducedgraphmindegree ] and lemma [ lemma_badset ] ) , we do not use any other property of random graphs , and since we have the corresponding lemmas for pseudorandom graphs , the exact same proof will work for pseudorandom graphs as well .",
    "then in order to prove theorem [ thm_pseudomainthm ] , we can first apply lemma for @xmath0 as in the proof of theorem [ thm_mainthmintro1 ] .",
    "since we need not develop a new lemma for @xmath7 , the remaining proof of theorem [ thm_pseudomainthm ] will be the same as in the random case .",
    "one difference is that @xmath47 is now a set of sublinear size compared to a set of constant size in the random case .",
    "however , the only part where we actually needed @xmath47 to be a set of constant size instead of sublinear size was where we wanted vertices with independent neighborhood ( claim [ clm_verticesforb ] ) . this issue has been resolved by increasing the number of such vertices accordingly in the graph @xmath7 .",
