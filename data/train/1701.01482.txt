    "the problem of reconstruction of spike - trains , and of similar signals , from noisy moment measurements , and a closely related problem of robust solving the classical prony system , is a well - known problem in mathematics and engineering .",
    "it is of major practical importance , and , in case when the nodes nearly collide , it presents major mathematical difficulties .",
    "it is closely related to a spike - train `` super - resolution problem '' , ( see @xcite as a small sample ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the possible amplification of the measurements error @xmath12 in the reconstruction process , caused by the fact that some of the nodes of @xmath0 near - collide .",
    "recently this problem attracted attention of many researchers .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it was shown ( in different settings of the problem ) that if @xmath13 spikes of @xmath0 are near - colliding in an interval of size @xmath14 , then a strong `` noise amplification '' occurs : up to a factor of @xmath15 .",
    "specifically , in @xcite a parametric setting ( the same as in the present paper ) was considered ( see , as a small sample , @xcite and references therein ) . in this",
    "setting , signals are assumed to be members of a parametric family with a finite number of parameters .",
    "the parameters of the signal are then considered as unknowns , while the measurements provide a system of algebraic equations in these unknowns .",
    "it was announced in @xcite that the strongest `` noise amplification '' occurs along the algebraic curves @xmath16 ( `` prony curves '' ) , defined in the signal parameter space by the @xmath17 initial equations of the classical `` prony system '' ( system [ eq : prony.system1 ] below ) .",
    "however , @xcite provided neither detailed proofs , nor explicit constants in the error bound , nor the explicit description of the curves @xmath16 .    in the present paper we consider reconstruction of spike - train signals of an a priori known form @xmath18 , from their moments @xmath19 , @xmath20 , in the case where two nodes @xmath21 near - collide .",
    "that is , @xmath22 .    in section [",
    "sec : setting ] we introduce the @xmath12-error set @xmath23 , consisting of all signals @xmath24 , for which the moments of @xmath24 differ from the moments of @xmath0 by at most @xmath12 .",
    "the set @xmath23 presents the distribution of all the possible reconstructed signals @xmath24 , caused by independent errors , not exceeding @xmath12 , in each of the moment measurements @xmath3 .",
    "thus the geometry of @xmath23 reflects the patterns of the possible error amplification in the reconstruction process .",
    "in this paper we are mostly interested in the lower bounds for the error in nodes reconstruction .",
    "we thus consider the projection @xmath25 of the error set @xmath23 to the nodes space .",
    "this set represents the error amplification in nodes reconstruction .",
    "in particular , the `` radius '' @xmath26 of @xmath25 provides a lower bound on the nodes reconstruction accuracy of any reconstruction algorithm ( see a more detailed description of this fact in section [ sec : setting ] ) .",
    "one of our two main results - theorem [ thm : main2 ] in section [ sec : error.amplification.main ] - is that _ for @xmath0 with two nodes in a distance @xmath27 , and for any @xmath12 of order @xmath28 ( or larger ) we have @xmath29 consequently , the presence of near - colliding nodes implies a massive amplification of the measurements error in the process of nodes reconstruction - up to @xmath30 times . _    in order to prove theorem [ thm : main2 ] we start in this paper the investigation of the geometry of the error sets @xmath23 and @xmath25 ( which , as we believe , is important by itself ) .",
    "first we provide in section [ sec : examples ] numerical simulations and visualizations , which suggest that for @xmath31 the @xmath12-error set @xmath23 is an `` elongated curvilinear parallelepiped '' of the width @xmath32 , stretched up to the size @xmath33 along a certain curve @xmath34 ( while its projection onto the nodes space , @xmath25 , is stretched along the projection @xmath35 of @xmath34 ) .",
    "these experiments suggest also that as @xmath36 , the sets @xmath23 and @xmath25 concentrate closer and closer around the curves @xmath34 ( respectively , @xmath35 ) .    next , we give in section [ sec : error.amplification.main ] an independent definition of the `` prony curves '' @xmath34 , `` discovered '' in section [ sec : examples ] : for each @xmath0 the prony curve @xmath37 passing through @xmath0 in the signal parameter space , is defined by the requirement that along it the first three moments @xmath11 do not change . an explicit parametric description of the curves @xmath34",
    "is given in section [ sec : parm.prony.curves ] .",
    "our second main result - theorem [ thm : main1 ] in section [ sec : error.amplification.main ] - is that _ indeed , as suggested by visualizations in section [ sec : examples ] , the set @xmath23 contains a `` sufficiently long '' part of the prony curve @xmath34 around @xmath0_. as a consequence , we obtain theorem [ thm : main2 ] .",
    "let us stress that all the constants in theorems [ thm : main1 ] and [ thm : main2 ] are explicit ( and reasonably realistic ) .",
    "the proofs are given in section [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : compl.nodes ] , we compare two approaches to the reconstruction problem for real spike - train signals : from their moments , and from their fourier samples ( which can be interpreted as the moments of an appropriate signal @xmath38 with complex nodes ) .",
    "recently in @xcite a trigonometric reconstruction method for @xmath38 was suggested , which uses , as an input , _ only three complex moments @xmath39_. according to the approach of the present paper , we would expect for the trigonometric method ( for @xmath38 with two nodes in a distance @xmath14 , and for @xmath40 , ) the worst case reconstruction error of order @xmath41 , while for the prony inversion we show it to be of order @xmath42 .",
    "we pose some open questions related to this apparent contradiction .",
    "the authors would like to thank the referee for a constructive criticism , as well as for remarks and suggestions , which allowed us to significantly improve the presentation .",
    "assume that our signal @xmath43 is a spike - train , that is , a linear combination of @xmath44 shifted @xmath45-functions : [ eq : equation.model.delta ] f(x)=_i=1^da_i(x - x_i ) , where @xmath46 we assume that the form ( [ eq : equation.model.delta ] ) is a priori known , but the specific parameters @xmath47 are unknown .",
    "our goal is to reconstruct @xmath47 from @xmath48 moments @xmath49 , which are known with a possible absolute error of no more than @xmath50 .",
    "the moments @xmath3 are expressed through the unknown parameters @xmath47 as @xmath51 . hence our reconstruction problem is equivalent to solving the ( possibly over - determined ) _ prony system _ of algebraic equations , with the unknowns @xmath52 :    [ eq : prony.system1 ] _",
    "i=1^d a_i x_i^k = m_k(f ) ,  k= 0,1,  ,n-1 .",
    "this system appears in many theoretical and applied problems .",
    "there exists a vast literature on prony and similar systems , in particular , on their robust solution in the presence of noise - see , as a small sample , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , and references therein .",
    "we present the spike train reconstruction problem in a geometric language of spaces and mappings .",
    "let us denote by @xmath53 the parameter space of signals @xmath0 , @xmath54 and by @xmath55 the moment space , consisting of the @xmath56-tuples of moments @xmath57",
    ". we will identify signals @xmath0 with their parameters @xmath58    the prony mapping @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 inversion of the prony mapping is equivalent to reconstruction of a spike - train signal @xmath0 from its moments ( or to solving prony system ( [ eq : prony.system1 ] ) ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the amplification of the measurements error @xmath12 in the reconstruction process , in case of two near - colliding nodes .",
    "we are interested in effects , caused by the geometric nature of system ( [ eq : prony.system1 ] ) , independently of the specific method of its inversion .    the error amplification is reflected by the geometry of the @xmath12-error set @xmath23 , which is defined as follows :    [ def : error.set ] the @xmath12-error set @xmath23 consists of all signals @xmath61 , for which the moments of @xmath24 differ from the moments of @xmath0 by at most @xmath12 : @xmath62 equivalently , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the @xmath56-dimensional @xmath12-cube centered at @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath12-error set @xmath23 presents the distribution of possible reconstructed signals @xmath24 , caused by the independent errors , not exceeding @xmath12 , in each of the moment measurements @xmath3 .",
    "its yet another convenient description is as the set of solutions of the prony system [ eq : prony.system2 ] _",
    "i=1^d a_i x_i^k = m_k(f)+_k ,  k= 0,1,  ,n-1 , with all the possible errors @xmath66 satisfying @xmath67    notice that the @xmath12-error set @xmath23 depends on @xmath56 , the number of the moments which we use in reconstruction .",
    "since @xmath56 is assumed to be fixed , we do not indicate it in the notations .",
    "in this paper we are mainly interested in the accuracy of the nodes reconstruction which is determined by the geometry of the projection @xmath68 of the set @xmath69 onto the nodes space .",
    "accordingly , we define the worst case error @xmath26 in the prony reconstruction of the nodes of @xmath0 as follows :    [ def : wrst.case.error ] for @xmath70 , the worst case error @xmath26 in the reconstruction of the nodes of @xmath0 is defined by [ eq : worst.case.error ] ^x_(f)=_f=(a,x)e_(f ) ||x-x|| , where @xmath71 denotes the euclidean norm in the space of the nodes .",
    "in fact , @xmath72 bounds from below the worst case error in nodes reconstruction with _ any _ reconstruction algorithm @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , we can informally argue as follows : let @xmath74 be a signal for which the supremum in ( [ eq : worst.case.error ] ) is nearly achieved .",
    "assume that we apply @xmath73 to both signals @xmath0 and @xmath75 , and the ( adversary ) noise is zero for @xmath0 and is equal to the difference of the moments of @xmath0 and @xmath75 in the second case .",
    "thus @xmath73 obtains as the input in both cases the moments of @xmath0 .",
    "whatever result @xmath76 the algorithm @xmath73 produces as an output , at least one of the distances @xmath77 or @xmath78 will be not smaller than @xmath72 .",
    "for a given @xmath80 consider a signal @xmath81 we put @xmath82 .",
    "the moments of @xmath0 are @xmath83 for a given @xmath50 we consider the @xmath12-cube @xmath84 centered at @xmath85 , and the @xmath12-error set @xmath86 equivalently , @xmath23 is defined in @xmath87 by the inequalities @xmath88     and its projection @xmath89 for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . ]     and its projection @xmath89 for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . ]",
    "the @xmath12-error set @xmath23 is a four - dimensional subset of @xmath93 and its direct visualization is problematic . instead the following figures [ fig : figure1 ] and [ fig : figure2 ] show the projection of @xmath23 onto the three - dimensional coordinate subspace of @xmath87 , spanned by the two nodes coordinates @xmath94 and the first amplitude @xmath95 , as well as its further projection @xmath25 onto the nodes plane @xmath94 .",
    "notice , that by the first of the prony equations @xmath96 in ( [ eq : prony.system2 ] ) we have @xmath97 with @xmath98 thus the projections of @xmath23 shown in figures [ fig : figure1 ] and [ fig : figure2 ] , give a rather accurate ( up to @xmath12 ) representation of the true error set .",
    "let us stress a natural scaling in our problem , reflected in figures [ fig : figure1 ] and [ fig : figure2 ] : _ the scale in nodes is of order @xmath27 , while the scale in the amplitudes is of order @xmath99_.    figures [ fig : figure1 ] and [ fig : figure2 ] suggest that @xmath23 is an `` elongated curvilinear parallelepiped '' , with the sizes of its two largest edges of orders @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively .",
    "( the third and the fourth edges , of orders @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively , are not visible ) .",
    "@xmath23 is stretched up to the size @xmath33 along a certain curve @xmath16 , depicted in the pictures . respectively , @xmath25 is stretched up to the size @xmath32 along the projection curve @xmath103 .",
    "a comparison between figures [ fig : figure1 ] and [ fig : figure2 ] also suggests that as @xmath27 ( and @xmath104 decrease , the error set concentrates closer and closer along the curve @xmath16 .",
    "( compare a conjectured general description of @xmath23 at the end of section [ sec : error.amplification.main ] ) .",
    "below we analyse the structure of the error set @xmath23 in some detail , and show that _ @xmath16 is an algebraic curve , which we call the `` prony curve''_. we show that for @xmath0 as above , the projection @xmath103 of @xmath16 onto the node subspace is the hyperbola @xmath105 , while @xmath95 is expressed on this curve through @xmath94 as @xmath106 in section [ sec : parm.prony.curves ] we study such `` prony curves '' in detail .",
    "numerically , the figures above were constructed via the following procedure : we construct a four - dimensional regular net @xmath107 with a sufficiently small step . for each point",
    "@xmath108 its prony preimage @xmath109 is calculated , and the projection of @xmath110 onto the space @xmath111 is plotted .",
    "some other visualisation results can be found in @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we assume that _ inversion of the prony map , or solving of ( [ eq : prony.system2 ] ) ( when possible ) is accurate , and the reconstruction error is caused only by the measurements errors @xmath66 . _",
    "we will consider signals @xmath43 of the form ( [ eq : equation.model.delta ] ) , with two near colliding nodes @xmath7 and @xmath112 in the present paper we study the geometry of the reconstruction error , allowing perturbations only of the cluster nodes @xmath113 and of their amplitudes @xmath114 .",
    "therefore the positions and the amplitudes of the other nodes are not relevant for our results . however , in order to avoid possible collisions of the cluster nodes with their neighbors in the process of deformation , we will always assume that for @xmath115 , the distances to the neighboring nodes from the left and from the right satisfy @xmath116 we do not assume formally that @xmath117 but this is the case where the geometric patterns we describe become apparent .    for each signal @xmath0 and index @xmath118 the prony curve @xmath119 passing through @xmath0",
    "is obtained by varying only the nodes and amplitudes @xmath120 , while preserving the first three moments .",
    "more accurately , we have the following definition :    [ def : prony.curves ] let @xmath121 and let @xmath122 be fixed .",
    "the prony curve @xmath123 consists of all the signals @xmath124 for which @xmath125 and @xmath126 for @xmath127 by definition , we always have @xmath128 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on an `` @xmath27-local '' part @xmath129 around @xmath0 of the prony curve @xmath130 , consisting of all @xmath131 for which the nodes @xmath132 belong to the disk @xmath133 of radius @xmath134 centered at @xmath135 in particular , the node collision can not happen on @xmath129 ( see lemma [ lem : bdd.dist11 ] below ) .",
    "compare also to figure [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "notice , however , that the prony curves @xmath130 are _ global algebraic curves ( possibly singular)_. their explicit global parametrization is described in section [ sec : parm.prony.curves ] below , and one can show that in some cases they can pass through the node collision points ( with amplitudes tending to infinity ) .",
    "we believe that the prony curves and their multi - dimensional generalizations play an important role in understanding of multi - nodes collision singularities .",
    "the following definition specifies the type of signals we will work with :    [ def : i.h.m.clusters ] a signal @xmath136 is said to form an @xmath137-cluster , with given @xmath138 and @xmath122 if @xmath139 and @xmath140 . for @xmath0",

    "we put @xmath143 ( notice that @xmath144 depends on @xmath145 , but not on @xmath27 ) .",
    "one of our main results is the following :    [ thm : main1 ] let @xmath146 form an @xmath137-cluster .",
    "then for each @xmath147 the @xmath12-error set @xmath23 contains the local prony curve @xmath148     and its projection @xmath89 for @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the circle depicts the boundary of the disk @xmath152 . in bold",

    "figure [ fig : figure3 ] suggests that in fact the @xmath12-error set @xmath23 `` concentrates '' around the local prony curve @xmath148 already the fact that this curve is inside @xmath23 ( provided by theorem [ thm : main1 ] ) implies important conclusion on the worst case reconstruction error . indeed , as we show below , the projection @xmath153 of the local prony curve @xmath129 onto the nodes space has a length of order @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , in the presence of an @xmath27-cluster in @xmath0 , and for each @xmath147 , there are signals @xmath154 with the nodes @xmath155 at a distance @xmath32 from @xmath21 .",
    "that is , a massive error amplification from @xmath28 to h occurs in this case .",
    "our second main result presents this fact formally , in terms of the worst case error :    [ thm : main2 ] let @xmath146 form an @xmath137-cluster . then for each @xmath147 the worst case reconstruction error @xmath156 in nodes of @xmath0 is at least @xmath134 .",
    "we see that a measurements error @xmath40 can be amplified up to the factor @xmath157 in reconstruction of the nodes of @xmath0 . in particular , for @xmath158 i.e , in the case of exactly two nodes in @xmath0 , and for @xmath159 ,",
    "we get ( assuming that @xmath160 and @xmath161)$ ] that @xmath162 so the minimal accuracy @xmath12 required to keep the error in the nodes reconstruction less than @xmath134 is @xmath163 .",
    "for @xmath164 we get @xmath165 .    in @xcite , in order to show that the length of the curve @xmath153 is of order @xmath27",
    ", we use the inverse function theorem , combined with estimations from @xcite of the jacobian of the prony mapping . as a result ,",
    "the constants become much less explicit .",
    "we expect that the results of theorems [ thm : main1 ] and [ thm : main2 ] can be extended to an accurate description of the @xmath12-error set in the case of clusters with more than two nodes , using an appropriate version of the `` quantitative inverse function theorem '' .",
    "informally , we expect the following general result to be true :    _ let the nodes @xmath166 of @xmath0 form a cluster of size @xmath167 then for @xmath168 the @xmath12-error set @xmath23 is a `` non - linear coordinate parallelepiped '' @xmath169 with respect to the moment coordinates @xmath170 , centered at @xmath0 .",
    "its width in the direction of the moment coordinate @xmath171 is of order @xmath172 in particular , the maximal stretching of @xmath169 , of order @xmath173 occurs along the prony curve @xmath174 .",
    "_    however , an application of the approach based on the inverse function theorem will significantly reduce the domain of applicability of the results , and will make the constants less explicit .    on the other hand , we believe that the explicit parametric description of the prony curves , given in section [ sec : parm.prony.curves ] below , can be extended to clusters with more than two nodes . it becomes significantly more complicated , but promises potentially better understanding of the geometry of error amplification .",
    "the proof of theorems [ thm : main1 ] and [ thm : main2 ] , given below , is based on a detailed explicit description of the prony curves , on one hand , and of a behavior of the moments @xmath175 on these curves , on the other .",
