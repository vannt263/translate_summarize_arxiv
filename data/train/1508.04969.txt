    "the problem of extending the thermodynamic formalism to systems out of equilibrium is a central challenge in statistical physics .",
    "significant progress on this topic has been made in the past two decades , yielding several remarkably general results such as fluctuation theorems @xcite .",
    "this has resulted in a large body of work that extends the notion of statistical ensembles to dynamical trajectories @xcite , and is closely connected to the mathematical theory of large deviations , which deals with probabilities of rare events ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , one is interested in calculating the statistics of time - integrated observables @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath1 is a ( phase - space ) trajectory of duration @xmath2 , @xmath3p[x]\\delta(a_t[x]-a).\\ ] ] here @xmath4 $ ] is a probability density functional of a path @xmath1 , and the integration is over all possible paths .",
    "examples of @xmath5 include the action functional @xcite , average drift of a brownian particle @xcite , transition history @xcite and time - integrated particle current in driven diffusive systems , e.g. in exclusion processes @xcite",
    ". often , it is of interest not only to calculate the probability density @xmath6 of a rare event , but to understand how the particular fluctuation leading to the rare event occurred .",
    "this amounts to selecting trajectories @xmath1 that have fixed @xmath0=a$ ] , @xmath7=\\frac{p[x , a_t = a]}{p(a_t = a)},\\ ] ] which resembles the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "unless we are in the low - noise regime , there will be many trajectories contributing to the event @xmath8 . selecting trajectories leading to @xmath8 from the original",
    ", unconstrained dynamics may prove difficult if @xmath8 is a rare event ( a large deviation ) , in which case the unconstrained average @xmath9 is different from @xmath10 for large @xmath2 , where @xmath11 is taken with respect to @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "even worse , we do not generally expect to find the constrained process to be markovian , which can pose serious difficulties for its analysis .",
    "a resolution to this problem in the spirit of equilibrium statistical physics , that is attracting much interest of late , is to look at the canonical path ensemble instead , @xmath12=\\frac{p[x]\\rme^{sa_t[x]}}{\\left\\langle \\rme^{sa_t}\\right\\rangle}.\\ ] ] this path ensemble is known under several names , depending on the field of study . in physics",
    ", it has been called _ s ensemble _ ( related to the choice of letter s for the tilting parameter ) , but also _ driven _ or _ biased _ ensemble ; in rare - event simulations it is called _ ( exponentially ) tilted _ ensemble , or _ esscher transform of @xmath13_.",
    "it has been used to probe rare trajectories in systems with metastable states , namely to study the glass transition @xcite and more recently to address the problem of protein folding @xcite .",
    "recently , chetrite and touchette have rigorously proved several remarkable properties of the canonical path ensemble @xcite .",
    "first , the canonical path ensemble can be realized by a markov process ( referred to as driven dynamics ) in the long - time limit .",
    "second , the microcanonical and the canonical path ensembles are asymptotically equivalent in the limit @xmath14 in the sense that @xmath15}{p_s[x]}=0\\;,\\ ] ] where the limit is approached almost surely and @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] are given by ( [ microcanonical ] ) and ( [ canonical ] ) respectively .",
    "this important result allows one to study ( generally unknown ) dynamics of constrained systems by studying dynamics of the driven process , which can be then analyzed using standard monte carlo techniques .",
    "the equivalence holds under the following three conditions @xcite :    * * condition a * : @xmath6 must satisfy a large deviation principle with a rate function @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes asymptotic behaviour in the sense that @xmath21 * * condition b * : the large deviation @xmath8 must arise entirely from the interior of the interval @xmath22 $ ] , e.g. excluding large deviations at the boundaries @xmath23 or @xmath2 , * * condition c * : the rate function @xmath18 must be convex at @xmath10 .",
    "we note that the rate function @xmath18 does not need to be differentiable at @xmath10 for the equivalence to hold .",
    "however , if it is then the tilting parameter is unique and is given by @xmath24 .",
    "conditions * a , b , c * are found to be sufficient for the ensemble equivalence to hold ; whether all conditions are necessary remains to be clarified .    in this work ,",
    "we are interested in cases where the microcanonical and canonical path ensembles are not equivalent .",
    "the inequivalence of the nonequilibrium path ensembles has been recently reported for large current fluctations in the zero - range process @xcite .",
    "the exactly solvable one - site model revealed that the problem lies in the infinite state space .",
    "for example , the spectrum of the driven process may become gapless or the process may have non - normalizable eigenvectors with respect to the initial measure . beyond this example , the necessary properties of the spectrum required for the equivalence of nonequilibrium ensembles is an open problem . in equilibrium",
    ", the inequivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles has been extensively studied for various models ( for a review , see @xcite ) , typically for systems with long - range interactions , such as gravitational systems , dipolar or unscreened coulomb systems .",
    "the total energy in these systems is no longer extensive in the energies of the subsystems , which may lead to the microcanonical entropy that is a nonconcave function of the energy . in that case",
    "the canonical free energy is not differentiable at some point and thus there is no temperature to establish the connection with the canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "consequently , these systems show interesting phenomena such as negative ( microcanonical ) specific heat , slow relaxation , quasi - steady states , etc .",
    "this motivates us to pose the following questions .",
    "what are the typical situations , analogous to e.g. long - range interactions in equilibrium , where the equivalence of path ensembles is not expected to hold ?",
    "moreover , are there common phenomena arising from the inequivalence of nonequilibrium path ensembles ?    to address these questions we focus here on stochastic bridges @xcite , which are obtained by conditioning markov processes on fixed @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus the observable @xmath5 is given by @xmath27 crucially , stochastic bridges are themselves markov processes for any finite time @xmath2 ( a property that is unlikely to hold for conditioning on more general @xmath5 ) which allows us to study their dynamics analytically .",
    "we present the solutions of several stochastic bridges for which the original , unconstrained dynamics violates one of the conditions a or b for ensemble equivalence mentioned above .",
    "these exact solutions shed light on why ensemble equivalence breaks down . for the examples we consider",
    ", ensemble inequivalence is typically manifested by condensation - like phenomena : the conditioning @xmath8 causes the original process to ` condense ' its large deviation ( to meet the conditioning ) in a vanishing fraction of the interval @xmath22 $ ] , rather than throughout the whole interval as implied by the driven process associated to the canonical ensemble ( [ canonical ] ) .",
    "related condensation phenomena are well known in the problem of sums of independent and identically distributed random variables .",
    "if the distribution of the random variables is heavy tailed then a large deviation of the sum typically occurs through a single random variable realising the large deviation of the sum @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent work has shown that a heavy - tailed distribution is not necessary for condensation to occur when there is a further constraint on the random variables in addition to their sum @xcite .",
    "this type of condensation is manifested in real - space condensation in spatially extended stochastic mass transport models such as the zero - range process wherein a single site captures a finite fraction of the total mass in the system @xcite . in this work",
    "we will examine the connection between temporal condensation exhibited in discrete - time stochastic bridges and condensation within collections of discrete random variables .",
    "we start by reviewing known results for diffusion bridges previously presented in @xcite : the equivalence of ensembles holds for brownian motion , but fails for the ornstein - uhlenbeck process where the large deviation is condensed into a boundary effect .",
    "we extend this result for temporal condensation to other diffusion processes in which there is a form of potential that causes the conditioning @xmath28 to be met in a non - extensive manner , to be explained in detail later . to stress the importance of the condition b for the equivalence to hold , we present a diffusion bridge for a multiplicative noise process ( the cir bridge ) in which @xmath6 has an exponential tail , but where the large deviation @xmath8 is again a boundary effect . as a borderline case",
    ", we also study the brownian motion with dry friction @xcite , for which the path ensembles are equivalent , but the connection between the two ensembles is not unique - a case known as partial equivalence @xcite .    after studying diffusion bridges , we look at several discrete - time markov chains driven by heavy - tailed ( and thus non - gaussian ) noise . there",
    "the rate function is formally zero and thus violates the condition a , which can be also related to the phenomenon of condensation in stationary states of mass - transport models ( for a review , see @xcite ) . at the end",
    ", we use the equivalence ( [ equivalence ] ) to revisit the interaction - driven condensation @xcite , and show that it is equivalent to the conditioning of random walk trajectories on a large deviation of their local time , which counts the number of returns to the origin .",
    "our results should serve as guiding principle for other , more complex stochastic systems , for which conditions a or b are generally difficult to examine .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we study stochastic bridges for diffusion processes in section [ diffusion_bridges ] and for discrete - time markov chains driven by heavy - tailed noise in section [ rw_bridges ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions based on these examples on when not to expect the equivalence to hold are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper , we consider a diffusion process defined by the following ( it ) stochastic differential equation ( sde ) , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is @xmath31-correlated noise , @xmath32 a diffusion bridge is a process obtained by conditioning @xmath33 in ( [ sde ] ) to have a fixed value of @xmath34 at time @xmath2 ; here we adopt the name `` bridge '' for a diffusion process on @xmath22 $ ] conditioned on @xmath35 , irrespective of the value of @xmath34 . ] .",
    "it is an ideal candidate for studying nonequilibrium path ensembles , for two reasons .",
    "first , the observable @xmath5 ( [ at1 ] ) takes the simple form @xmath36 where we have set @xmath37 to impose a large deviation .",
    "second , the conditioned process itself can be conveniently described by a stochastic differential equation that is similar to ( [ sde ] ) , but with a modified drift term @xcite . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath38 solve the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the stochastic differential equation ( [ sde ] ) , subject to the initial condition @xmath39 , @xmath40+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left[\\sigma^2(x , t ) p\\right].\\ ] ] the probability density @xmath41 for the stochastic bridge is given by @xmath42 here , @xmath43 solves the backward kolmogorov equation @xmath44 subject to the final condition @xmath45 .",
    "now it is straightforward to obtain @xmath46 then substituting ( [ fp],[backward ] ) and regrouping terms yields , after some calculation , the following fokker - planck equation for @xmath41 @xmath47+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left[\\sigma^2(x , t ) g\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 and the subscript @xmath2 emphasises that @xmath48 depends explicitly on @xmath2 . using ( [ fp_bridge ] ) ,",
    "we arrive at the following stochastic differential equation for the diffusion bridge which we denote here and in the following by @xmath50 @xmath51 where the expression for @xmath48 is given in ( [ drift_bridge ] ) .",
    "note that the equation ( [ sde_bridge ] ) is an exact equation for the conditioned process which is a diffusion with ( non - homogeneous ) drift given by ( [ drift_bridge ] ) and noise width @xmath52 .",
    "this fact allows us to study the microcanonical dynamics , provided we can solve the backward kolmogorov equation for @xmath53 .",
    "if so , the equation ( [ sde_bridge ] ) can be then solved numerically using e.g. an euler - mayurama scheme .",
    "moreover , if @xmath53 has a simple enough form we can compute exactly various quantities for the conditioned process .",
    "next , we will present several examples of diffusion bridges , for which there is an explicit expression for @xmath41 and thus for @xmath48 .      for the brownian bridge discussed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have @xmath54 which also includes a special case of @xmath55 called the wiener bridge .",
    "the solution to the corresponding fokker - planck equation subject to @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 because the process is both space- and time - homogeneous , the expression for @xmath43 is the same as for @xmath58 , yielding @xmath59 ^ 2}{2 ( t - t)\\sigma^2}}.\\ ] ] for @xmath60 , the stochastic differential equation for the brownian bridge is thus given by @xmath61 where we denoted the bridge by @xmath50 to distinguish it from the unconstrained process .",
    "we note that the drift @xmath62 of the bridge process is actually time and space dependent , but as we shall see , for large @xmath63 becomes independent of @xmath2 and @xmath64 .",
    "also note that equation ( [ sde_brownian_bridge ] ) is linear in @xmath63 and therefore its solution can be written explicitly , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is wiener process .",

    "the equivalence between the brownian bridge and the corresponding driven process has been established in ref .",
    "essentially , one looks at the probability density @xmath76 for the unconstrained dynamics , which from ( [ fp_solution_brownian ] ) reads @xmath77 the corresponding rate function is given by @xmath78 and is differentiable , yielding @xmath79 as the tilting parameter .",
    "one then constructs ` driven dynamics ' using the generalised doob transform @xcite , to obtain that the drift of the driven process in the large @xmath2 limit is exactly @xmath10 , as for the brownian bridge .",

    "starting from @xmath97 at time @xmath187 , the ornstein - uhlenbeck process and the brownian motion with dry friction both relax to their stationary distributions , which explains why the trajectories depicted in figure [ fig2 ] and [ fig3](a ) are initially not affected by the conditioning @xmath202 .",

    "the connection has been recently established rigorously , based on conditions rooted in the large deviation theory .    in this work",
    ", we presented several constrained stochastic systems in which one or two of these conditions are not met , and we studied whether they are equivalent to their corresponding driven processes in the s ensemble approach . for a one - dimensional stochastic variable @xmath210 , we looked at large deviations of its time - integrated speed on the interval @xmath22 $ ] , which amounts to conditioning on the fixed value of @xmath108 .",

    "notably , this is manifested by condensation - like phenomena , in the sense that to meet the conditioning , the constrained process changes only a small portion of the dynamics .",
    "we have found essentially two types of condensation phenomena in these examples , both related to anomalous large deviations .",
    "the first type of condensation is where a large deviation is not realised in the interior of the interval @xmath22 $ ] , but is rather a boundary effect realised at time @xmath2 .",
    "one such example , the ornstein - uhlenbeck bridge , was first reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present study we analysed several other diffusion bridges and argued that a similar boundary effect leading to ensemble inequivalence is expected whenever a large deviation of @xmath108 is ` penalised ' by a confining potential .",
    "in addition , we presented a borderline case of brownian motion with dry friction , where constrained dynamics is modified on a finite fraction of the interval that scales linearly with @xmath2 , which presents an example of partial equivalence .",
    "the second type of condensation is where a large deviation is realised by a single random variable , and is due to heavy - tailed probability distributions ; the same phenomenon ( in space , rather than in time ) has been observed in the stationary states of mass - transport models such as the zero - range process .",
    "the presented examples are by no means an exhaustive list of processes that exhibit condensation and inequivalence of nonequilibrium path ensembles . in fact , the equivalence established in refs .",
    "@xcite provides a powerful tool for understanding other condensation phenomena whose mechanism of condensation is not obvious . here",
    "we briefly mention the case of interaction - driven condensation reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the original zero - range process was generalised to include hopping rates that depend not only on the departure site , but also on its immediate environment , causing correlations between neighbouring random variables .",
    "the stationary probability of this process still admits a factorised form , which reads @xmath275 where the delta function ensures that the total mass is conserved . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the following choice for @xmath276 was used @xmath277\\cdot\\textrm{exp}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}u\\delta_{m,0}+\\frac{1}{2}u\\delta_{n,0}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath278 stands for the kronecker delta function , and @xmath279 and @xmath280 are constants . when inserted into ( [ pairfactorized ] ) ,",
    "the first factor in ( [ w ] ) contributes to the probability of a random walk path , which becomes apparent by making the following change in notation : @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath283 , where @xmath284 is the same as in ( [ path_rw ] ) .",
    "the extra factor in ( [ w ] ) , when inserted in ( [ pairfactorized ] ) , appears in the path probability @xmath285 $ ] as a factor of @xmath286 , where @xmath287 is given by @xmath288 the time - integrated observable @xmath287 measures the number of returns to the origin and is a discrete - time analogue of local time .",
    "the final expression for the path probability @xmath285 $ ] thus has a hard constraint on the sum @xmath289 , which is the total area under the trajectory , and the tilting factor of @xmath286 related to conditioning on local time .",
    "the latter conditioning ensures that the number of visits to the origin scales with the total time @xmath2 , so that the whole process is a series of random walk excursions ( recurrent trajectories that stay positive ) , conditioned on a fixed value of the total area and on the total duration @xmath2 .",
    "one can show that these two constraints are responsible for the condensation .",
    "details of this calculation , which is similar to the one for the constraint - driven condensation @xcite , will be presented elsewhere .",
