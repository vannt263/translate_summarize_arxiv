    "absorptive forces are dissipative , and hence useful for cooling , while purely dispersive forces are conservative and hence useful for maintaining coherence .",

    "relativistically , the presence of energy and momentum in the energy - momentum 4-vector means that field energy in some frame is momentum in another frame .",
    "a recent experiment at the university of queensland demonstrated the transfer of field angular momentum to micron sized particles ( he _ et al .",

    "quantizing the field with plane wave spatial modes @xmath8 gives field quanta , called photons , with momentum @xmath9 .",
    "the dissipative , or scattering , force is then particularly simple to understand .",
    "each photon absorption gives a momentum kick @xmath9 to the absorber .",
    "each subsequent spontaneous emission gives a kick of the same magnitude but in a random direction , producing no average force .",
    "however the resultant momentum fluctuations are what limit cooling , as we shall see in section [ dopplercool ] .",
    "the dissipative force from a laser can slow a counter - propagating beam of atoms .",
    "the changing doppler shift as the atoms slow can be overcome by chirping the laser frequency or by zeeman shifting the atomic transition frequency with a spatially varying magnetic field .",
    "a slowed beam may be transversely cooled by two - dimensional optical molasses .",
    "this consists of two lasers counter - propagating transversely to the atomic beam and tuned below resonance - so called red detuning .",
    "transverse motion doppler shifts the counter - propagating beam towards resonance and the co - propagating beam away from resonance . hence more counter - propagating photons are absorbed and the atom slows .",
    "this process is called doppler cooling .",
    "there is a limit to the temperature achievable by doppler cooling - the so called doppler limit @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the transition linewidth or inverse lifetime .",

    "@xmath12 240 @xmath5k .",
    "the doppler limit is interesting because it depends only on the linewidth .",
    "the molasses cools the atoms until their kinetic energy equals half the transition energy uncertainty @xmath13 ( stenholm 1986 ) .",
    "this is reasonable since the atoms are inelastically scattering photons .",
    "scattered photons will typically differ in energy by the linewidth .",
    "the difference between the scattered photon energy and the absorbed photon energy appears as the atomic kinetic energy . in section [ dopplercool ]",
    "we derive the doppler limit by balancing the cooling rate with the heating rate due to the spontaneous emission recoils .",
    "forces arise when there is a spatial gradient in the expectation value of a system s energy , i.e. hamiltonian . a two - level atom interacting with the electric field @xmath14 has the hamiltonian ( allen and eberly 1987 ) ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the ground and excited atomic states respectively , @xmath18 is the transition energy , and @xmath19 its electric dipole moment operator . assuming no spatial dependence of @xmath20 the heisenberg equation of motion for the momentum @xmath21 is @xmath22 =      -\\underline{\\nabla } h = \\nabla ( \\underline{d }      \\cdot \\underline{e}(\\underline{r},t ) ) \\quad ,      \\label{heisenbergmom}\\ ] ] since the time derivative of the momentum is the force , @xmath23 .",
    "forces arising from a gradient in the hamiltonian are conservative , there is no energy dissipation as in doppler cooling .",
    "the force described by equation ( [ heisenbergmom ] ) is known as the gradient force or dipole force .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , equation ( [ jcham ] ) , are called dressed states ( cohen - tannoudji _ et al .",
    "the energy expectation value is the sum over the dressed states of the product of their energies and populations .",
    "dipole forces arise due to gradients in the dressed state energies , or due to dressed state population gradients , or both .    in this paper",
    "we only consider the semiclassical case in which @xmath24 is a classical field .",
    "ignoring the kinetic energy and making the rotating wave approximation , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the field frequency and @xmath27 is the dipole matrix element related to the transition linewidth by @xmath28 .",
    "we eliminate the time dependence of the field by working in the interaction picture with @xmath29 and with interaction hamiltonian @xmath30 where we have defined the field - atom detuning @xmath31 .",
    "the semiclassical dressed states are the eigenstates of this hamiltonian .",
    "they and their energies are @xmath32 @xmath33 we have introduced the rabi frequency and the generalised rabi frequency @xmath34 the difference between the generalised rabi frequency and the detuning is referred to as the light shift .",
    "it is the shift in the transition frequency due to interaction with the light field .",
    "consider a ground state atom slowly moving into a laser beam .",
    "the adiabatic theorem ( messiah 1966 ) implies that it remains in the hamiltonian eigenstate continuously connected to the zero field ground state . which dressed state this is depends on the field detuning @xmath35 @xmath36 consequently the hamiltonian expectation value is just the eigenvalue @xmath37 . in the limit of detuning @xmath38 large compared to the rabi frequency @xmath39 @xmath40 for constant detuning only the second term contributes to the gradient corresponding to an effective potential @xmath41 this is the mechanical potential produced by intensity gradients of a far detuned field .",
    "it has the same sign as @xmath42 .",
    "so for @xmath43 , blue detuning , it rises in high intensity regions from which atoms are therefore repelled .",
    "otherwise , for @xmath44 , red detuning , atoms are attracted to high intensity regions .",
    "this far detuned potential has a simple interpretation in terms of the bare atomic states .",
    "the excited state population @xmath45 is given by equation ( [ expop ] ) , and the atom is excited by absorbing photons with energy @xmath46 greater than that of the excited atom .",
    "the energy excess @xmath47 is exactly the potential , equation ( [ fardetpot ] ) ; the energy excess appears as mechanical potential energy .",
    "the red detuned dipole force can be used to construct an atom trap called the far off resonance trap or fort .",
    "it is essentially optical tweezers for atoms .",
    "a fort trap has been demonstrated to operate at 65 nm detuning , confining rb atoms at 0.4 mk ( miller _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) .",
    "since it is non - dissipative the dipole force is most suitable for constructing atom optics devices which preserve quantum coherence .",
    "this is a requirement for atom interferometry .",
    "proposed atom waveguides constructed from hollow optical fibres utilize the dipole force to repel the atoms from the fibre walls ( marksteiner _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) .",
    "let s get an idea of the scale of the forces , masses , accelerations and so on that are typical of atom optics .",
    "for concreteness we consider a sodium atom which has a mass of @xmath48 au = @xmath49 kg .",
    "the yellow d - line transition is 3s@xmath50 3p@xmath51 with wavelength 589.0 nm , and lifetime 16.4 ns ( adams _ et al . _",
    "a saturated sodium atom has 50% probability to be excited , so on average it absorbs , and emits , one photon every 33 ns or @xmath52 photons / s .",
    "the impulse from the absorbed photon momenta is @xmath53 ( kg m / s)/s . the corresponding acceleration of the atom is @xmath54 m / s@xmath55 g. at this acceleration a 500 m / s atom is brought to rest in half a millisecond over about 13 cm .",
    "the doppler limit temperature , equation ( [ dopplerlim ] ) , of 240 @xmath5k corresponds to a thermal velocity @xmath56 by comparison at a temperature of 300 k the average thermal speed in a maxwellian distribution is @xmath57 m / s .",
    "the recoil speed from a photon emission or absorption is @xmath58 a thermal speed of 3 cm / s corresponds to a temperature of about 1 @xmath5k .",
    "this recoil limit speed will turn out to be the lower limit to speeds attainable by cooling mechanisms for which the cold atoms interact with light . since @xmath59 for both matter and light",
    "the corresponding atomic de broglie wavelength is , by momentum conservation , just that of the photon @xmath60 589 nm .",
    "the corresponding kinetic energy @xmath61 j. this is nearly 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of a photon @xmath62 j. it corresponds to a detuning of about @xmath63 rad / s .",
    "a great variety of cooling methods have been demonstrated ( metcalf and van der straten 1994 ) .",
    "they can be classified with respect to two limits representing the lowest temperatures attainable with the particular method : the doppler limit and the recoil limit : @xmath64 for na these are respectively 240 @xmath5k and 1.2 @xmath5k .",
    "cooling using doppler tuning of an atomic transition is doppler limited due to heating by the scattered photon recoils .",
    "sub - doppler cooling utilizes the multi - level nature of atoms to approach the recoil limit .",
    "it is limited by the fact that the coldest atoms have scattered a last photon and hence have at least the photon recoil energy .",
    "sub - recoil cooling requires passive velocity groups for the atoms to accumulate in without scattering photons .",
    "doppler cooling was introduced in section [ dissipative ] . in this section",
    "the doppler cooling limit is derived by balancing the viscous cooling with the recoil heating .",
    "we assume a two - level atom with velocity @xmath65 and transition frequency @xmath20 interacting with 1d optical molasses at frequency @xmath26 .",
    "the optical molasses consists of two counterpropagating laser beams : beam 1 with wavevector @xmath66 and beam 2 with wavevector @xmath67 .",
    "the field - atom detuning is denoted by @xmath68 . from the semiclassical bloch equations ( allen and eberly 1987 ) the steady state excited state population is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the saturation parameter , expressed in terms of the rabi frequency @xmath39 , equation ( [ rabifreq ] ) , for the atom field interaction .",
    "we now assume that the transition is sufficiently far from saturation @xmath71 that the absorption from each beam is independent",
    ". then the force on the atom is the sum of the momentum absorption rate from each beam @xmath72 for the small velocities at the doppler cooling limit we can expand @xmath70 in @xmath73 to get @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the zero velocity saturation parameter . substituting these expansions into the force equation ( [ force1 ] )",
    "gives @xmath76 for red detuning , @xmath44 , this is a viscous type damping force proportional to the atomic velocity .",
    "the associated kinetic energy cooling rate is @xmath77 where the angle brackets denote an average over the atomic ensemble .",
    "we next consider the photon recoil heating of the atom .",
    "each spontaneous emission kicks the atom in a random direction with momentum magnitude @xmath78 , producing a random walk in momentum space .",
    "so after @xmath79 emissions the mean square momentum magnitude is @xmath80 .",
    "the total momentum diffusion rate is four times this .",
    "one factor of two comes from spontaneous emission from the two beams .",
    "the other factor of two comes from the absorption , which is also a random process ( cohen - tannoudji 1992 ) . using the spontaneous emission rate @xmath81",
    "we then have the following expression for the kinetic energy heating rate @xmath82 where we have used the zero velocity saturation parameter , as our goal is to find the temperature minimum . at equilibrium",
    "the sum of this heating rate and the cooling rate , equation ( [ coolrate ] ) , is zero @xmath83 @xmath84 the last bracketed expression has a minimum of @xmath85 at @xmath86 , so this detuning gives the minimum mean kinetic energy .",
    "this defines the doppler limit energy @xmath87 , so @xmath88 a result explained heuristically at the end of section [ dissipative ] .",
    "the doppler cooling discussed in the previous section only works for light intensities below saturation . above saturation stimulated processes become important and cooling only occurs for blue detuning !",
    "this blue cooling is stronger than doppler cooling but does not achieve as low temperatures ( aspect _ et al .",
    "this is because although the damping is stronger so are the fluctuations .",
    "it is an example of a more general mechanism called sisyphus cooling after the mythological sisyphus , king of corinth , who was doomed by zeus to roll a rock uphill forever . in a standing wave",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath39 varies with the spatial mode function from zero at the nodes ( zero field ) to a maximum at the anti - nodes .",
    "hence so does the energy splitting of the semiclassical dressed states @xmath89 , equation ( [ genrabifreq ] ) .",
    "cooling occurs because , as we shall see , spontaneous emission is most likely to occur from energy maxima into energy minima .",
    "the atom then moves up the energy hill and is again most likely to emit at the maximum . on average kinetic energy",
    "is converted to atom - field interaction energy which is lost by spontaneous emission .",
    "a detailed explanation using dressed atomic states with a quantized field has been given by dalibard and cohen - tannoudji ( 1985 ) .",
    "by contrast we use semiclassical dressed states , which were introduced in section [ conservative ] . any dressed state with an excited state component",
    "can spontaneously emit into any dressed state with a ground state component .",
    "in general a dressed state can spontaneously emit into itself as well as into the other dressed state .",
    "we now explain blue sisyphus cooling with reference to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in a standing wave field",
    "the electric field is zero at the nodes and is maximum at the anti - nodes .",
    "so the generalised rabi frequency , equation ( [ genrabifreq ] ) , varies from @xmath90 at the nodes to @xmath91 at the anti - nodes .",
    "@xmath92 is the higher energy state and for blue detuning , @xmath93 , it equals the ground state @xmath16 at a node .",
    "it increases in energy and mixes in the excited state @xmath17 as the field increases .",
    "@xmath94 is the lower energy state and for blue detuning it equals @xmath17 at the nodes and it decreases in energy and mixes in the ground state with increasing field .",
    "consequently at anti - nodes @xmath92 has its maximum energy and @xmath94 its minimum energy while at nodes the opposite holds .",
    "but @xmath92 is most likely to spontaneously emit at anti - nodes since there it has the largest excited state component .",
    "it can decay either to itself , in which case only the photon energy @xmath95 is lost , or to @xmath94 , in which case the larger energy @xmath96 is lost .",
    "( recall that the dressed states are defined in a picture rotating with frequency @xmath26 , so @xmath95 is the energy zero ) .",
    "in contrast the dressed state @xmath94 is most likely to spontaneously emit at nodes , where it is exactly the bare excited state , @xmath17 . at a node",
    "it has no ground state component and hence can only decay to @xmath92 , losing energy @xmath97 .",
    "since this is smaller than @xmath98 more energy than @xmath95 is lost on average per spontaneous emission .",
    "this energy can not be provided by the photons absorbed from the field , which have energy @xmath99 .",
    "it comes from kinetic energy and hence cools the atom .",
    "the transfer of kinetic energy to atom - field interaction energy is the sisyphus mechanism .",
    "an atom which has just spontaneously emitted is most likely to be in the energy minimum for its dressed state .",
    "any motion increases the field - atom interaction energy until it is most likely to spontaneously emit again at the top of the energy hill .",
    "thus kinetic energy is transformed into interaction energy which is dissipated by spontaneous emission .",
    "consider a sequence of spontaneous emissions which start and end in the same dressed state while passing through the other dressed state .",
    "the most likely starting point is at an energy maximum and the most likely end point an energy minimum .",
    "hence the total process of ( at least ) two spontaneous emissions dissipates the energy difference between the maximum and minimum , which is just the light shift .",
    "sequences which increase the energy are possible , but less likely .    the limiting temperature is determined by the heating due to spontaneous emissions .",
    "emission from @xmath100 is most likely to leave the atom in @xmath100 with no cooling effect , but recoil heating still occurs .      to cool below the doppler limit , equation ( [ dopplerlim2 ] ) ,",
    "requires multi - level atoms . since atoms are multi - level and since theorists like two - level atoms it is perhaps not surprising that sub - doppler cooling was discovered experimentally ( lett _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) . a common feature of the various sub - doppler , but super - recoil , cooling schemes is optical pumping .",
    "optical pumping is the transfer of population between atomic magnetic sublevels . for definiteness",
    "we consider a total angular momentum @xmath101 transition , fig .",
    "circularly polarized light is either @xmath102 or @xmath103 with photon angular momentum @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively .",
    "an atom in the @xmath106 ground state sub - level can be excited into the @xmath107 excited state sub - level by absorbing a @xmath102 photon , and into the @xmath108 excited state sub - level by absorbing a @xmath103 photon .",
    "similarly the @xmath109 ground sub - level is excited into either the @xmath110 or @xmath111 excited sub - levels by absorbing a @xmath102 or @xmath103 photon respectively .",
    "absorption of @xmath102 polarized light increases the magnetic quantum number @xmath112 while @xmath103 polarized light decreases it .",
    "the net result of cycles of absorption and spontaneous emission in circularly polarized light is optical pumping : the preferential population of ground sub - levels with extremal @xmath112 . in this case",
    "either the @xmath113 or @xmath111 sub - level . in the following we are only concerned with weak fields so that excited state population is negligible .",
    "spatially dependent optical pumping occurs when the the pumped sub - level depends on position . in 3d",
    "this is unavoidable and is usually achieved with three pairs of counter - propagating laser beams . because the atoms are moving the state of the atom lags behind the local steady state .",
    "cooling is achieved when this lag is used to remove energy from the atoms as they are optically pumped towards local equilibrium . since polarization gradient cooling is one of the more effective of such mechanisms ,",
    "we consider it next .",
    "polarization gradient cooling uses counter - propagating beams with perpendicular linear polarizations to achieve spatially dependent optical pumping , fig .",
    "this is known as the lin perp lin configuration .",
    "atoms lose kinetic energy by a sisyphus mechanism in which the hills are due to light shifts .",
    "3d lin @xmath114 lin cooling to within a few recoil velocities , about 25 @xmath5k for na , has been achieved ( cohen - tannoudji and phillips 1990 ) .    the polarization varies with a period of @xmath115 from linear to @xmath102 , to the orthogonal linear , to @xmath103 , and back to linear , fig .",
    "the linear polarization is at angle @xmath116 to the input linear polarizations .",
    "this can be seen from the expression for the electric field in the lin @xmath114 lin configuration @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are unit vectors in the @xmath120 and @xmath121 directions . using @xmath122 and some trigonometric identities",
    "gives @xmath123 at @xmath124 the field is linearly polarized in the @xmath125 direction . at @xmath126 , @xmath127 and the magnitude of the field is constant in time and hence it is circularly polarized . at @xmath128 , @xmath129 and the field",
    "is linearly polarized in the @xmath130 direction . at @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and",
    "the field is again circularly polarized , but this time with the opposite rotation sense .",
    "this polarization gradient produces spatially dependent optical pumping .",
    "lin @xmath114 lin cooling uses light shifting of the ground sub - levels .",
    "light shifting was discussed for two - level transitions in section[conservative ] .",
    "the total shift of the @xmath134 sub - levels is the sum of the shifts due to each of the two transitions to which they are coupled by the lasers .",
    "the proportion of @xmath103 and @xmath102 varies spatially . and",
    "since each transition has a different coupling strength , as determined by the clebsch - gordon coefficients , the light shifts of the ground sub - levels depend on position .",
    "these shifts are negative for red detuning and for the @xmath106 sub - level are maximum in magnitude where the field is @xmath103 polarized , and minimum where it is @xmath102 .",
    "the opposite is true for the @xmath107 sub - level , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . at the minimum light shift positions",
    "optical pumping into the other sub - level is strongest .",
    "the result is that atoms move uphill until they are optically pumped into the other sub - level .",
    "this pumping takes energy out of the atom provided the atomic state lags the local equilibrium by somewhat less than the optical pumping time @xmath135 .",
    "this is the average time for optical pumping to transfer population between the ground sub - levels and is proportional to the intensity .",
    "hence lin @xmath114 lin cooling works best for velocities",
    "@xmath136 such that the atom travels @xmath137 in @xmath135 , @xmath138 .",
    "atoms which are moving too fast do not respond to the local pumping and hence do not lose energy .",
    "atoms which are moving too slowly are pumped to the other sub - level before reaching the top of the hill and hence lose less energy .",
    "polarization gradient cooling does not achieve the recoil limit .",
    "cooling closer to the recoil limit can be achieved after trapping the atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "adiabatically expanding the lattice cools the atoms .",
    "reduction of cs temperature from the 3 @xmath5k achievable with polarization gradient cooling to 0.7 @xmath5k has been demonstrated with adiabatic cooling ( kastberg _ et al .",
    "this is short of the cs recoil limit of 0.13 @xmath5k .",
    "for cooling below the recoil limit the problem is to avoid the recoil from the last photon emitted from determining the temperature .",
    "there are two successful approaches : momentum diffusion into a passive zero velocity group , and evaporation of the hottest atoms , avoiding photons altogether . velocity selective coherent population trapping ( vscpt ) and raman cooling use the first approach .    in this section",
    "we discuss a simple model of 1d vscpt based on a three - level lambda transition .",

    "a set of states closed under this hamiltonian is @xmath141 the `` nc '' stands for non - coupling and the `` c '' for coupling .",
    "the interesting thing is the action of the hamiltonian equation ( [ vscptham ] ) on @xmath142 .",
    "since @xmath143 generates a momentum space displacement of the momentum eigenstate @xmath144 to @xmath145 , @xmath146 for @xmath147 it is an eigenstate of the kinetic energy and has no coupling to any other state .",
    "this is called a dark state because it does not interact with the field .",

    "the non - coupling states are populated via momentum diffusion due to spontaneous emission from the excited state .",
    "the coupling amplitude out of them , into @xmath149 states is proportional to @xmath150 and hence their lifetime increases as their momentum @xmath150 decreases .    in principle",
    "there is no minimum temperature for vscpt .",
    "the range of populated non - coupling states near @xmath147 decreases with time as they are pumped out via the coupling state .",
    "this is because the momentum diffusion into a particular momentum group is independent of its momentum , while the @xmath151 coupling amplitude is proportional to @xmath150 , and hence vanishes as @xmath152 .",
    "the dark state @xmath153 is a quantum mechanical superposition of the atom moving to the left and to the right with the recoil momentum @xmath78 . in the 2d case",
    "the corresponding dark state is a superposition of four atomic momentum states .",
    "these states were observed in a paris experiment ( lawall _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) . to confirm the superposition , rather than an incoherent mixture , would require interferometry , which remains to be done .",
    "like vscpt raman cooling works by isolating the atoms near zero velocity from the cooling fields .",
    "however there is no dark state in raman cooling , rather the extremely narrow linewidths possible for raman transitions enable tuning of the raman pulses so that they do not affect the zero velocity group .",
    "because the energy difference between the levels in a raman transition can be very small they can have narrow linewidths .",
    "this can be used to select out correspondingly narrow velocity groups , and push them around .",
    "kasevich and chu ( 1992 ) used this method to push atoms towards zero velocity and achieved 100 nk for na in 1d , which is 10 times below recoil . in 2d and 3d",
    "they did not quite get to recoil although they beat polarization gradient cooling by a factor of nearly 20 ( davidson _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) .",
    "raman cooling uses a sequence of raman pulses from counter - propagating lasers to push atoms towards zero velocity .",
    "each raman transition changes the atomic velocity by @xmath154 .",
    "the pulses are designed so zero velocity atoms are unaffected , and the accuracy with which this can be achieved is one of the limits to the cooling . since",
    "many raman cycles are needed for cooling , the atoms must be repumped to their original state . the zero velocity state is populated randomly by atoms which have zero velocity after repumping .",
    "evaporative cooling has achieved the lowest 3d temperatures to date , 170 nk for rb ( anderson _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , and 100 nk for li ( bradley _ et al .",
    "these temperatures should be compared to the recoil limit temperatures , equation ( [ limits ] ) , of @xmath155 nk for rb and @xmath156 @xmath5k for li .",
    "this is what made bose - einstein condensation of these atoms possible .",
    "the cooling is achieved by bleeding off the highest energy atoms from the trap .",
    "thermalisation of the remaining atoms by elastic collisions produces cooling .",
    "after a subsequent adiabatic expansion anderson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reported a temperature of 20 nk .",
    "the trap is magnetic , section [ magtrap ] , so that no optical heating occurs . only atoms in magnetic states such that their magnetic dipole is attracted to the trap centre are trapped .",
    "if the magnetic state is changed the atoms are no longer trapped and they escape .",
    "such spin flips are induced by rf fields tuned to a zeeman splitting frequency .",
    "since this frequency depends on the local magnetic field strength , spin flips can be selectively induced in the outer parts of the traps .",
    "these are precisely the regions occupied by the high energy atoms .",
    "progressive cooling is achieved by ramping down the rf frequency .",
    "this moves the resonance region towards the centre of the trap , where fields are lowest , and allows colder atoms to evaporate .",
    "the optical earnshaw theorem states that atoms for which the dissipative force , section [ dissipative ] , is proportional to the intensity can not be trapped by static configurations of laser beams ( ashkin and gordon 1983 ) .",
    "it is true for the same reason as the classical earnshaw theorem is true , section [ ion ] . in a region of space without sources or sinks for light",
    "there is as much energy flowing in as out , and the dissipative force is in the same direction as the energy flow .",
    "fortunately the conditions of the theorem can be violated by adding external fields ( pritchard _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ) . in the case of the highly successful magneto - optical trap",
    "this is an inhomogeneous magnetic field which zeeman shifts the transition so that the force is not just proportional to the local intensity .",
    "optical molasses , discussed in section [ dopplercool ] , does not trap atoms .",
    "however because the atomic motion is diffusive rather than ballistic the atoms can take seconds to travel centimeters ( chu _ et al .",
    "the dynamics is that of einstein / langevin brownian motion ( gardiner 1985 ) . using the damping constant of equation ( [ force2 ] ) , @xmath157 we have the langevin equation for the 1d position @xmath120 of a doppler cooled atom @xmath158 where we have introduced the zero mean noise term @xmath79 .",
    "an equation for @xmath159 may be found after multiplying equation ( [ langevin ] ) by @xmath120 and using @xmath160 @xmath161 where @xmath162 is an integration constant . for long times",
    "the exponential on the right hand side can be ignored and then @xmath163 for na the root - mean - square displacement over one second is about a few centimeters for @xmath164 = 100 @xmath5k .",
    "magneto - optical traps , or mots , are now quite common ( wieman _ et al .",
    "they are also known as zeeman - optical traps , or zots .",
    "they use an inhomogeneous magnetic field to produce a position dependent scattering force .",
    "the magnetic field zeeman shifts transitions towards or away from resonance with red - detuned , counter - propagating , oppositely circularly polarized laser beams .",
    "consider a @xmath165 system .",
    "the two transitions coupling to circularly polarized light are shifted by positive and negative magnetic fields as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . the magnetic field generated by anti - helmholtz coils",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . for an atom displaced towards the @xmath103 polarized beam",
    "the magnetic field becomes more positive and it zeeman shifts the @xmath103 transition into resonance and the @xmath102 transition away from resonance . hence the scattering from the @xmath103 beam dominates and the atom is pushed back towards the centre of the trap .",
    "the magnetic field and laser polarizations are such that atoms are pushed back to the centre after displacement in any direction .",
    "the mot lasers cool the atoms too .",
    "an atom stopping at its turning point is accelerated back towards the centre .",
    "however once the doppler shift @xmath166 exceeds the linewidth @xmath11 it is no longer accelerated .",
    "so the maximum rebound speed is about @xmath167 , corresponding to a temperature of about @xmath168 ( metcalf and van der straten 1994 ) .",
    "this is much higher than the doppler limit , equation ( [ dopplerlim2 ] ) .",
    "ion traps have certain advantages over optical traps ( blatt 1992 ) .",
    "most importantly the trapping does not rely on interaction with light .",
    "the potentially extremely small dissipation in ion traps has allowed the demonstration of quantum logic gates ( monroe _ et al .",
    "they are one of the more promising ways of realizing quantum computers ( cirac and zoller 1995 ) .",
    "since the divergence of the electric field in free space is zero any region must have field lines both going in and coming out .",
    "equivalently there can be no maxima or minima of the electrostatic potential in free space .",
    "this is the content of earnshaw s electrostatic theorem .",
    "consequently an ion can not be trapped by electrostatic fields alone .",
    "this problem has been solved in two ways : by adding a magnetic field , the penning trap , or by oscillating the electric field , the paul trap .",
    "a quadrupole potential @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the radial coordinate , is produced by the ring and endcap electrode configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "the penning trap achieves radial confinement with an axial magnetic field , in the @xmath140 direction .",
    "this inhibits radial motion by converting it to circular cyclotron motion about the magnetic field lines .",
    "the overall motion of the ion is the combination of a slow magnetron rotation ( @xmath171 10 khz ) about the @xmath140 axis and the fast cyclotron motion ( @xmath171 1000 khz ) about the local magnetic field lines .",
    "the electrostatic field provides confinement in the @xmath140 direction .",
    "the axial oscillation frequency lies between these two .",
    "the paul trap adds rf time dependence to the potential equation ( [ quadpot ] ) of the form @xmath172 .",
    "this allows a dynamic stability .",
    "again the ion motion has two components ; slow approximately harmonic motion in the axial and radial directions , and rapid micromotion oscillation about the local position at the driving frequency ( @xmath171 10 mhz ) .",
    "magnetic traps confine atoms by exerting a force on the atomic magnetic dipole moment .",
    "many different trap configurations have been proposed ( bergeman _ et al . _ 1987 ) .",
    "since they avoid laser heating , and the coulomb repulsion of ions , magnetic traps have been used to bose - einstein condense atoms .",
    "the force is the gradient of the dipole energy @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the dipole moment of the magnetic sub - level of the atom and @xmath175 is the magnetic field . for sufficiently slow atomic motion",
    "the the magnetic sub - level adiabatically follows the changing direction of the magnetic field as it moves around the trap . for example",
    "an atom in the local ground state remains in the local ground state . consequently its magnetic moment changes .",
    "atoms in magnetic sub - levels whose zeeman energy @xmath176 decreases with magnetic field strength are forced towards the field minimum .",
    "et al . _  ( 1995 ) used a variation on the simple quadrupole trap formed with anti - helmholtz coils ( midgall _ et al . _ 1985 ) , called the time - averaged orbiting potential , or top , trap .",
    "this overcomes a problem with the simple quadrupole trap caused by its minimum being zero magnetic field .",
    "close to @xmath177 the zeeman levels are nearly degenerate and the atomic state may no longer adiabatically follow the magnetic field .",
    "non - adiabatic transitions to non - trapped magnetic sublevels can occur , leading to trap loss .",
    "this problem is particularly bad in quadrupole traps because the field increases linearly in all directions away from the minimum , so the field derivative is not zero at the field zero .",
    "the top trap adds an rf field which rotates the field zero in a circle .",
    "the time averaged field then has a non - zero , quadratic minimum where the zero previously was .",
    "atoms are still lost from the instantaneous zero , but they are high energy atoms with respect to the time - averaged potential and hence contribute to evaporative cooling .",
    "bradley _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1995 ) used an arrangement of six permanent magnets to produce a field with a non - zero minimum in which they reported bose - einstein condensation of li .",
    "gravity is an important consideration for cold atoms .",
    "the energy gained by a na atom falling through 1 mm is about @xmath178 j , or more than twenty times the recoil energy .",
    "gravity can be used to trap atoms in a trampoline configuration .",
    "ten bounces of about 3 mm height have been observed experimentally off a parabolic evanescent wave reflector ( aminoff _ et al .",
    "this corresponds to a trapping time of about 0.1 s. this result can probably be substantially improved by enhancing the evanescent field .",
    "confinement times at least 50 times longer have been obtained using two sheets of blue detuned light to form a `` v '' in which atoms bounce ( davidson _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .",
    "other reflector shapes such as pyramids and cones have been analyzed ( sding _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; dowling and gea - banacloche 1995 ) .",
    "recoil limited sisyphus cooling mechanisms which utilize gravity can be incorporated .",
    "for example if the sub - level changes during the bounce the average force on the way out can be less than that on the way in ( ovchinnikov _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , leading to an inelastic , cooling bounce .",
