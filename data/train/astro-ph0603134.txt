    "the knowledge of the temperature structure of an h ii region is essential for the determination of its element abundances .",
    "heavy element abundances are typically derived from fluxes of collisionally excited forbidden lines in the optical range and they depend very sensitively ( exponentially ) on the adopted electron temperature .",
    "since different ions reside in different parts of the h ii region with different electron temperatures , an appropriately determined temperature is required for each ionic species to correctly derive its abundance .",
    "fluxes of the recombination lines of hydrogen , helium and some heavy elements seen in the optical spectra of h ii regions are less sensitive to electron temperature .",
    "however for some scientific problems , a very high precision in the element abundances derived from recombination lines is required .",
    "for example , the helium primordial abundance needs to be determined to better than about 1 - 2% to yield interesting cosmological constraints . in those cases , to reach the desired precision , the variations of the electron temperature in the h ii region need to be taken into account for the recombination transitions as well .",
    "there are several known methods for the determination of the electron temperature @xmath3 in h ii regions .",
    "one of them is based on the temperature - sensitive intensity ratios of collisionally excited forbidden lines of different ions , such as [ o iii ] @xmath2(4959 + 5007)/@xmath24363 , [ ne iii ] @xmath23868/@xmath23342 , [ ar iii ] @xmath27135/@xmath25192 , [ n ii ] @xmath2(6548 + 6584)/@xmath25754 , [ o ii ] @xmath2(7320 + 7330)/@xmath23727 and others @xcite . most often , it is the nebular to auroral line intensity ratio of doubly ionized oxygen [ o iii ] @xmath2(4959 + 5007)/@xmath24363 that is used .",
    "such a method can be applied to h ii regions with @xmath3@xmath410@xmath5k where the auroral emission line [ o iii ] @xmath24363 is sufficiently bright to be detected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another way for determining electron temperatures in h ii regions relies on discontinuities in the continuum emission of hydrogen and helium free - bound recombination processes .",
    "most often the balmer discontinuity at 3646    and the paschen discontinuity at 8207   are used .",
    "@xcite was the first to use the balmer discontinuity , or balmer jump , to derive electron temperatures @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) in several galactic h ii regions , using the intensity ratio bj/@xmath6(h@xmath7 ) , where bj = @xmath6(3646@xmath8 ) ",
    "@xmath6(3646@xmath0 ) is the value of the balmer jump .",
    "much later , to reduce the interstellar reddening effect on the determination of @xmath3 , @xcite and @xcite have proposed to use the h11 hydrogen emission line instead of the h@xmath7 emission line , defining the balmer jump as bj / h11 = [ @xmath9(@xmath23646 ) ",
    "@xmath9(@xmath23681)]/@xmath6(h11 @xmath23770 ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have suggested a new approach to derive the electron temperature and density in h ii regions from the observed nebular hydrogen recombination spectrum .",
    "the method is based on fitting the dereddened observed spectrum around the region of the balmer jump with model spectra calculated from recombination theory by varying the electron temperature and density .    while these methods of electron temperature determination may in principle",
    "be applied to any type of photoionized gaseous region , in practice they have been mainly applied to planetary nebulae ( pne ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a general finding of the above work for pne is that the electron temperature @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) derived from the balmer jump is systematically lower than the temperature @xmath3(o iii ) derived from the collisionally excited [ o iii ] emission lines .",
    "furthermore , @xcite by using the he i recombination lines and the he i discontinuity at 3421  to measure electron temperatures , have found that @xmath3(he@xmath0 ) in pne is significantly lower than @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) .",

    "* ) while in some other h ii regions , the two temperatures are comparable ( e.g. , in orion nebula , * ? ? ?",
    "the exact cause of these temperature differences is still unclear .",
    "following @xcite , they are usually attributed to temperature fluctuations in chemically homogeneous gaseous nebulae .",
    "however , no homogeneous photoionization models can give temperature fluctuations as large as those observed .",
    "if we characterize the spatial temperature fluctuations in h ii regions by @xmath13 , the mean square temperature variation @xcite , then models give @xmath13 in the 0.002  0.025 range , with typical values around 0.005 , while observations give @xmath13 in the 0.02  0.04 range ( see the review in * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite have studied small - scale temperature fluctuations in the orion nebula with _ hst _",

    ". however , small - scale variations ( over a few arcsec or @xmath11 0.005 pc ) were found .",
    "those authors concluded that none of the physical mechanisms that have been proposed thus far is able to account for the observed temperature differences .",
    "the difference between @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath3(o iii ) may have important consequences for the heavy element abundance determination in h ii regions , as their derived abundances depend sensitively on the adopted temperature .",
    "indeed , in the majority of such studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the heavy element abundances are derived assuming that the temperature of the h@xmath0 zone is equal to the temperature of the o@xmath1 zone .",
    "if instead , @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) is smaller than @xmath3(o iii ) , then the heavy element abundances would be increased .",
    "this issue is especially important for the determination of the primordial he abundance from spectra of low - metallicity bcds . in this work @xcite",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) = @xmath3(o iii ) .",
    "if indeed @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) is less than @xmath3(o iii ) in the h ii regions of the low - metallicity bcds , then the derived he abundances would be lower , resulting in a lower primordial he abundance @xcite .    in all the above studies , direct measurements of @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) by the balmer or paschen jump techniques",
    "have been carried out only for relatively high - metallicity h ii regions .",
    "the metallicity range is generally between 1/3 solar and solar metallicity . with the exception of mrk 71 = ngc 2363 @xcite with a metallicity of 1/10 that of the sun",
    ", no direct measurements of @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) in very low - metallicity bcds have been done . yet , those very metal - deficient objects which span a metallicity range of about 1/50 to 1/10 of the sun s metallicity are precisely those used in the determination of the primordial he abundance . thus to assess a potential source of systematic error in the primordial he abundance measurement which may compromise the reliability of the cosmological constraints that are derived from it , it is crucial to investigate whether temperature differences are as important in low - metallicity bcds as they are in high - metallicity h ii regions and pne .",
    "we have thus embarked on an observational program with the mmt to obtain blue spectra of a large sample of bcds in the 3200 ",
    "5200  wavelength range which includes the region of the balmer jump .",
    "in addition , we have supplemented our data with spectra of bright h ii regions from the data release 3 ( dr3 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) in the wavelength range 3800  9200 , which includes the paschen jump region .",
    "we wish to directly measure the electron temperature @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) in these h ii regions by applying either the balmer jump technique on the mmt spectra or the paschen jump technique on the sdss spectra .",
    "we present in this paper the first results of the program . in section [ tee ] , we describe the observational sample and the method used to determine @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) in the h ii regions . we compare @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath3(o iii ) for our sample of h ii regions and discuss the issue of temperature differences in low - metallicity emission - line galaxies in section [ results ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "the mmt observational sample consists of 22 low - metallicity h ii regions in 18 bcds and of one h ii region , j1404 + 5423 , in the spiral galaxy m101 .",
    "the sample is the same as the one used by @xcite to study high - ionization emission lines in low - metallicity bcds .",
    "the selection criteria of the sample are given in @xcite , so we will not repeat them here in detail . for our present purposes",
    ", it is sufficient to know that the bcds were chosen to span a large metallicity range , from about 1/60 of solar metallicity for sbs 0335052w to about 1/3 of solar metallicity for mrk 35 = haro 3 , so we can study any trend of differences between @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath3(o iii ) with metallicity . since the electron temperature of an h ii region depends on its metallicity , this ensures that the h ii regions in our bcd sample span a large range of electron temperatures .",
    "they were also selected to cover a large range of equivalent widths of the h@xmath7 emission line , with ew(h@xmath7 ) varying from from 18  to 397 . since ew(h@xmath7 ) is a measure of the relative contribution of the ionized gas emission to the total light , this allows to study how stellar emission affects the derived electron temperatures .",
    "the observed bcds are listed in order of decreasing ew(h@xmath7 ) , i.e. in order of increasing contribution of the stellar component to the total light , in table [ te ] .",
    "the general characteristics for each bcd can be found in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "we can also determine electron temperatures from the paschen jump at 8207  . to this end , we have extracted spectra of 24 bright h ii regions from the dr3 of the sdss which cover the red wavelength region and include the paschen jump , and which constitute what will be designated hereafter as the sdss sample .",
    "the sdss sample includes eleven h ii regions in dwarf emission - line galaxies , and 13 h ii regions in spiral galaxies in a metallicity range from about 1/50 of solar metallicity for i zw 18 se to about 1/2 of solar metallicity for j1402 + 5416 . the extracted h ii regions with their derived parameters and spectroscopic sdss i d numbers are listed in order of decreasing ew(h@xmath7 ) in table [ te1 ] . while the metallicity range of the sdss sample is about the same as that of the mmt sample , the sdss sample contains a larger fraction of high - metallicity h ii regions .    the observations of the mmt sample were carried out with the 6.5-m mmt on the nights of 2004 february 1920 and 2005 february 4 , using the blue channel of the mmt spectrograph .",
    "we used a 2@xmath14300  slit and a 800 grooves / mm grating in first order .",
    "the above instrumental set - up gave a spatial scale along the slit of 06 pixel@xmath15 , a scale perpendicular to the slit of 0.75  pixel@xmath15 , a spectral range of 3200  5200  and a spectral resolution of @xmath11 3  ( fwhm ) .",
    "the seeing was in the range 12 .",
    "the spectra of the majority of the galaxies have been obtained with the slit oriented with the parallactic angle .",
    "the only exceptions concern sbs 0335052w and sbs 0335052e where the slit was oriented along the major axes of the galaxies , with position angles of 30@xmath16 and 80@xmath16 respectively , and mrk 71 , where the slit was oriented along the position angle of + 60@xmath16 , so as to go through the three brightest h ii regions . in those cases , differential refraction may play a role , and we analyze its possible effect in section [ results ] .",
    "three kitt peak irs spectroscopic standard stars , g191b2b , feige 34 and hz 44 were observed at the beginning , middle and end of each night for flux calibration .",
    "for the final calibration curve , we adopt the mean of three derived response curves , which does not deviate by more than 1% from the response curves obtained from each standard star individually , over the whole wavelength range .",
    "spectra of he - ar comparison arcs were obtained before and after each observation to calibrate the wavelength scale .",
    "the log of observations is given in table 2 of @xcite and details of the data reduction can be found in the same paper .    for the present analysis",
    ", we have used the same one - dimensional spectra as those of @xcite .",

    "is the sum of both stellar and ionized gas emission , its shape depends on the relative contribution of these two components . in bcds",
    ", the contribution of the ionized gas emission can be very large .",
    "however , the equivalent widths of the hydrogen emission lines never reach the theoretical values for pure gaseous emission , implying a non - zero contribution of stellar emission in all objects",
    ". the contribution of gaseous emission relative to stellar emission can be parametrized by the equivalent width of the h@xmath7 emission line ew(h@xmath7 ) .",
    "given a temperature , the ratio of the gaseous emission to the total emission is equal to the ratio of the observed ew(h@xmath7 ) to the equivalent width of h@xmath7 expected for pure gaseous emission .",
    "the shape of the spectrum depends also on reddening .",
    "the extinction coefficient for the ionized gas @xmath17(h@xmath7)@xmath18 can be obtained from the observed hydrogen balmer decrement . however , there is no direct way to derive the extinction coefficient @xmath17(h@xmath7)@xmath19 for the stellar emission which can be different from the ionized gas extinction coefficient . finally , the sed depends on the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "we have carried out a series of monte carlo simulations to reproduce the sed in each h ii region of our sample . to calculate the contribution of the stellar emission to the seds",
    ", we have adopted the grid of the padua stellar evolution models by @xcite with heavy element mass fractions @xmath10 = 0.0001 , 0.0004 , 0.001 , 0.004 , 0.008 . to check the sensitivity of our calculations to the particular stellar tracks adopted ,",
    "we have also considered geneva tracks @xcite . with these tracks , we obtained results similar to those gotten with the padua ones . nevertheless , the geneva models are less appropriate for our goals as they do not include stellar models older than 1 gyr .",
    "therefore we do not include the results obtained with the geneva models in this paper . to reproduce the sed of the stellar component with any star formation history , we have calculated with the package pegase.2 @xcite a grid of instantaneous burst seds in a wide range of ages , from 0.5 myr to 15 gyr .",
    "we have adopted a stellar initial mass function with a salpeter slope , an upper mass limit of 100 @xmath20 and a lower mass limit of 0.1 @xmath20 .",
    "then the sed with any star formation history can be obtained by integrating the instantaneous bursts seds over time with a specified time - varying star formation rate .",
    "more than @xmath1190% of the emission of an h ii region is due to the ongoing burst of star formation .",
    "therefore , the shape of its spectrum is not very sensitive to variations in the star formation history of the older stellar populations .",
    "thus , as a first approximation , we have approximated the star formation history in each bcd by two short bursts with different strengths : a recent burst with age @xmath21(young ) @xmath22 10 myr which accounts for the young stellar population and a prior burst with age @xmath21(old ) varying between 10 myr and 15 gyr and responsible for the older stars .",
    "the contribution of each burst to the sed is defined by the ratio of the masses of stellar populations formed respectively in the old and young bursts , @xmath23 = @xmath24(old)/@xmath24(young ) , which we vary between 0.01 and 100 . to check the sensitivity of our calculations to the adopted star formation history",
    ", we have also considered the case where star formation is continuous for the old stellar population .",
    "the contribution of the gaseous emission was scaled to the stellar emission using the ratio of the observed equivalent width of the h@xmath7 emission line to the equivalent width of h@xmath7 expected for pure gaseous emission .",
    "the continuous gaseous emission is taken from @xcite and includes hydrogen and helium free - bound , free - free and two - photon emission . in our models",
    "it is always calculated with the electron temperature @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) of the h@xmath0 zone and with the chemical composition derived from the h ii region spectrum .",
    "the observed emission lines corrected for reddening and scaled using the absolute flux of the h@xmath7 emission line were added to the calculated gaseous continuum .",
    "the fraction of the gaseous continuum to the total light depends on the adopted electron temperature @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) in the h@xmath0 zone , since ew(h@xmath7 ) for pure gaseous emission decreases with increasing @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "given that @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) is not necessarily equal to @xmath3(o iii ) , we chose to vary it in the range ( 0.7  1.3)@xmath14@xmath3(o iii ) .",
    "strong emission lines in bcds ( see fig .  [ sp_1 ] ) are usually measured with good precision and so the equivalent width of the h@xmath7 emission line and the extinction coefficient for the ionized gas are accurate to @xmath255% or @xmath2520% , respectively",
    ". thus we vary ew(h@xmath7 ) between 0.95 and 1.05 times its nominal value . as for the extinction , we assume that the extinction @xmath17(h@xmath7)@xmath19 for the stellar light is the same as @xmath17(h@xmath7)@xmath18 for the ionized gas , and we vary both in the range ( 0.8  1.2)@xmath14@xmath17(h@xmath7)@xmath18 .",
    "we run a large number ( either 10@xmath26 or 10@xmath27 ) of monte carlo models varying randomly @xmath21(young ) , @xmath21(old ) , @xmath23 and @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) in a large range , and ew(h@xmath7 ) , @xmath17(h@xmath7)@xmath18 and @xmath17(h@xmath7)@xmath19 in a relatively smaller range because the latter quantities are more directly constrained by observations .",
    "because of the somewhat large number of parameters , the determination of @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) in any particular h ii region may not be very certain .",
    "in addition to model assumptions , the result may also be affected by observational and data reduction uncertainties .",
    "therefore it is important to adopt a statistical approach and use a large sample of h ii regions covering a wide range of metallicities to make more definite conclusions on the temperature differences between the o@xmath1 and h@xmath0 zones .      to judge the goodness of each model",
    "s fit to the observed sed , we have computed a mean deviation @xmath28 between the observed and modeled spectra for each monte carlo realization . to obtain @xmath28",

    "we did not attempt to fit stellar absorption features such as the hydrogen absorption lines because of their weakness , especially in the lower signal - to - noise ratio sdss spectra .",
    "additionally , the broad wings of the strong hydrogen emission lines significantly alter the shape of the absorption lines , especially in h ii regions with high ew(h@xmath7 ) , such as mrk 71 , ii zw 40 , sbs 0335052e and others ( see fig . [ sp_1 ] ) .",
    "however , in galaxies with relatively low ew(h@xmath7 ) , the hydrogen absorption features are reproduced quite well ( see for example the case of i zw 18 se in fig . [ sp_3 ] ) .    to gauge the goodness of the fit",
    ", we have used the @xmath28 statistic instead of the usual @xmath33 test because in the latter statistic , the weight of each region in the overall sed fit depends on the spectrum noise in it . since the noise is largest in the bluest part of the mmt spectrum which includes the balmer jump , the weight of this region in the fit is always small .",
    "therefore , the balmer jump region which plays a crucial role for the determination of @xmath3(h@xmath0 ) is not well fitted by the model sed if the @xmath33 statistic is used . for uniformity ,",

    "the h ii regions are arranged in order of decreasing of h@xmath7 equivalent width , i.e. in order of decreasing contribution of gaseous emission relative to stellar emission . the @xmath34(h@xmath0 )",
    "that are derived from the best fits are given in table [ te ] for the mmt sample , and in table [ te1 ] for the sdss sample in the column labeled `` inst + inst '' ( to denote instantaneous bursts for both the young and old stellar populations ) .",
    "we examine next several factors which may affect the electron temperatures so derived .      we have noted in sect .",
    "[ tee ] that the majority of the h ii regions from the mmt sample were observed at parallactic angle .",
    "therefore , differential refraction is not important for those objects .",
    "however that was not the case for 3 objects , sbs 0335052w , sbs 0335052e and mrk 71 .",
    "to check for differential refraction effects in those cases , we have modeled every of the seven individual spectra of sbs 0335052e obtained at different airmasses . the weighted",
    "mean temperature @xmath34(h@xmath0 ) of the 10 best sed fits for each observation is plotted as a function of airmass in fig .",
    "[ atmref ] .",
    "there is no evident trend .",
    "the absence of dependence of @xmath34 on airmass can probably be explained by the fact that the reddening correction applied to the whole spectrum is based on the observed fluxes of the hydrogen balmer lines which are themselves subject to differential refraction effects .",
    "that procedure thus automatically removes a large part of such effects in the observed seds .",
    "therefore we conclude that differential refraction does not significantly affect the electron temperature determination in the three h ii regions in our mmt sample that are subject to it .",
    "the same conclusion holds for sdss spectra as well .",
    "these were obtained with an airmass not exceeding 1.3 .",
    "all of our above model fitting was done assuming that the stellar populations contributing to the light of the h ii region were formed in two short bursts of star formation , a recent one for the young stellar population , and a prior one for the old stellar population . while the approximation of an instantaneous burst is a good one for the young ionizing stellar population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is probably less so for the old stellar population .",
    "the observed sed of the old stellar population in the underlying extended component of a galaxy is more realistically modeled by a continuous star formation , as shown e.g. by @xcite .",
    "we wish to investigate how our derived temperatures depend on the adopted star formation history in a galaxy . to this end , we have also carried out monte carlo simulations for all objects in the mmt and sdss samples in which the old stellar population is assumed to be formed not in a short burst , but continuously with a constant star formation rate starting at an initial time @xmath36 and stopping at a final time @xmath37 .",
    "this is similar to the approach adopted by @xcite .",
    "since the exact star formation history for the old stellar population is not known , we choose @xmath36 and @xmath37 to be random numbers between 10 myr and 15 gyr with the condition that @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath36 .",
    "the best solutions are derived in the same way as for the two burst model simulations .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in tables [ te ] and [ te1 ] in the column labeled `` inst + cont '' ( to denote that the young stellar population is formed in an instantaneous burst and the old one in a continuous mode ) .",
    "examination of fig .",
    "[ t_inst_cont ] where @xmath34(inst + inst ) is plotted against @xmath34(inst + cont ) reveals no significant difference between the two temperatures .",
    "the relative insensitivity of the derived temperatures @xmath34(h@xmath0 ) to the particular star formation history of the old stellar population is due to the fact that the contribution of this population to the light of the bright h ii region is always small , not exceeding a few percent in the optical range .",
    "we conclude that the two - burst model is a good approximation to the type of objects considered here . therefore ,",
    "in the following , we will consider only results obtained with the two - burst models .",
    "they require much less computational time than those with continuous star formation for the old stellar population .",

    "we wish to examine next which factors may affect the dispersion of @xmath34(h@xmath0 ) and hence limit the precision of its determination .",
