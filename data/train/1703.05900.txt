    "this research will focus on the rate of convergence of local functionals of real - valued homogeneous random fields with long - range dependence .",
    "non - linear integral functionals on bounded sets of @xmath0 are studied .",
    "these functionals are important statistical tools in various fields of application , for example , image analysis , cosmology , finance , and geology .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite that these functionals can produce non - gaussian limits and require normalizing coefficients different from those in central limit theorems .    since",
    "many modern statistical models are now designed to deal with non - gaussian data , non - central limit theory is gaining more and more popularity .",
    "some novel results using different models and asymptotic distributions were obtained during the past few years , see @xcite , bre1 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein . despite such development of the asymptotic theory ,",
    "only a few of the studies obtained the rate of convergence , especially in the non - central case .",
    "there are two popular approaches to investigate the rate of convergence in the literature : the direct probability approach @xcite , @xcite , and the stein - malliavin method introduced in @xcite .",
    "as the name suggests , the stein - malliavin method combines malliavin calculus and stein s method .",
    "the main strength of this approach is that it does not use any restrictions on the moments of order higher than four ( see , for example , @xcite ) and even three in some cases ( see @xcite ) . for a more detailed description of the method , the reader is referred to @xcite . at this moment",
    ", the stein - malliavin approach is well developed for stochastic processes .",
    "however , many problems concerning non - central limit theorems for random fields remain unsolved .",
    "the full list of the already solved problems can be found in nourweb .",
    "one of the first papers which obtained the rate of convergence in the central limit theorem using the stein - malliavin approach was @xcite .",
    "the case of stochastic processes was considered .",
    "further refinement of these results can be found in @xcite , where optimal berry - esseen bounds for the normal approximation of functionals of gaussian fields are shown .",
    "however , it is known that numerous functionals do not converge to the gaussian distribution .",
    "the conditions to obtain the gaussian asymptotics can be found in so - called breuer - major theorems , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these results are based on the method of cumulants and diagram formulae . using the stein - malliavin approach",
    ", @xcite derived a version of a quantitative breuer - major theorem that contains a stronger version of the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rate of convergence for wasserstein topology was found and an upper bound for the kolmogorov distance was given as a relationship between the kolmogorov and wasserstein distances . in @xcite",
    "the authors directly derived the upper - bound for the kolmogorov distance in the same quantitative breuer - major theorem as in @xcite and showed that this bound is better than the known bounds in the literature , since it converges to zero faster .",
    "the results described above are the most general results currently known concerning the rate of convergence in the central limit theorem using the stein - malliavin approach .    related to @xcite",
    "is the work @xcite where , using the same arguments , the author found the rate of convergence for the central limit theorem of sojourn times of gaussian fields .",
    "similar results for the kolmogorov distance were obtained in @xcite .",
    "concerning non - central limit theorems , only partial results have been found .",
    "it is known from @xcite,@xcite and @xcite that , depending on the value of the hurst parameter , functionals of fractional brownian motion can converge either to the standard gaussian distribution or a hermite - type distribution .",
    "this idea was used in @xcite and @xcite to obtain the first rates of convergence in non - central limit theorems using the stein - malliavin method .",
    "similar to the case of central limit theorems , these results were obtained for stochastic processes . in @xcite",
    "fractional brownian motion was considered , and rates of convergence for both gaussian and hermite - type asymptotic distributions were given .",
    "furthermore all the results of @xcite were refined in @xcite for the case of the fractional brownian sheet as an initial random element .",
    "it makes @xcite the only known work that uses the stein - malliavin method to provide the rate of convergence of some local functionals of random fields with long - range dependence .",
    "separately stands @xcite .",
    "this work followed a new approach based only on stein s method without malliavin calculus .",
    "the authors worked with wasserstein-2 metrics and showed the rate of convergence of quadratic functionals of i.i.d .",
    "gaussian variables .",
    "it is one of the convergence results which ca nt be obtained using the regular stein - malliavin method @xcite .",
    "however , we are not aware of extensions of these results to the multi - dimensional and non - gaussian cases .",
    "the classical probability approach employs direct probability methods to find the rate of convergence .",
    "its main advantage over the other methods is that it directly uses the correlation functions and spectral densities of the involved random fields .",
    "therefore , asymptotic results can be explicitly obtained for wide classes of random fields using slowly varying functions . using this approach , the first rate of convergence in the central limit theorem for gaussian fields",
    "was obtained in @xcite . in the following years",
    ", some other results were obtained , but all of them studied the convergence to the gaussian distribution .    as for convergence to non - gaussian distributions , the only known result using the classical probability approach",
    "is @xcite . for functionals of hermite rank-2 polynomials of long - range dependent gaussian fields , it investigated the rate of convergence in the kolmogorov metric of these functionals to the rosenblatt - type distribution . in this paper",
    ", we generalize these results to some classes of hermite - type distributions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our present results are obtained under more natural and much weaker assumptions on the spectral densities than those in main .",
    "these quite general assumptions allow to consider various new asymptotic scenarios even for the rosenblatt - type case in @xcite .",
    "it s also worth mentioning that in the known stein - malliavin results , the rate of convergence was obtained only for a leading term or a fixed number of chaoses in the wiener chaos expansion .",
    "however , while other expansion terms in higher level wiener chaoses do not change the asymptotic distribution , they can substantially contribute to the rate of convergence .",
    "the method proposed in this manuscript takes into account all terms in the wiener chaos expansion to derive rates of convergence .",
    "it is well known , see @xcite , that the probability distributions of hermite - type random variables are absolutely continuous . in this paper",
    "we investigate some fine properties of these distributions required to derive rates of convergence .",
    "specifically , we discuss the cases of bounded probability density functions of hermite - type random variables . using the method proposed in @xcite",
    ", we derive the anti - concentration inequality that can be applied to estimate the lvy concentration function of hermite - type random variables .",
