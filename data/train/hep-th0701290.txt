    "the @xmath0 superconformal algebra contains the energy momentum tensor @xmath5 , two ( conjugate ) supercharges @xmath6 and a @xmath7 current @xmath8 : . ]",
    "@xmath9 the constant @xmath10 is the central charge , while the conformal dimension and @xmath7 charge of the operators are displayed in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     furthermore , note the important relations @xmath11      now we are ready to discuss possible candidates for topological correlation functions .",
    "the first ( and probably simplest ) guess is @xmath12^{g-1}\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although the charge deficit is perfectly balanced , this expression can be easily shown to vanish identically : rewriting one of the @xmath13 as @xmath14 one can deform the contour of integration , such that it encircles other operators of the correlation function .",
    "the only two possibilities are however @xmath15 thus , we have to add another insertion , which has a non - vanishing residue with @xmath13 and zero charge , i.e. @xmath8 : @xmath16^{g-1}\\cdot\\nonumber\\\\ & \\cdot\\int |j|^2\\rangle.\\label{top1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in some cases it is useful to rewrite this result in a somewhat different form : expressing one of the @xmath17 ( say the one at @xmath18 ) as @xmath19 one can again deform the contour integral around the other operators .",
    "the only possibility to get a non - vanishing answer is to encircle @xmath8 , yielding @xmath13 according to ( [ defcon ] ) .",
    "one then finds the alternative writing for @xmath20 : @xmath21^{g}\\rangle.\\label{top2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the next question is to find a possible connection between some physical string amplitudes and the topological correlation function ( [ top1 ] ) and ( [ top2 ] ) .",
    "the answer to this question was given in @xcite , namely the relevant couplings on the string side involve four 6d gravitons and @xmath22 graviphotons at genus @xmath23 : @xmath24 with @xmath25 the ( self - dual ) graviphoton field strength , where the graviphotons are left @xmath26 right handed chiral spinors and @xmath27 the 6d ( self - dual ) riemann tensor . although self - duality in 6 dimensions is meaningless , one can define a similar notion by contracting with the 6d lorentz generators in the chiral representation submatrices of the full @xmath28 lorentz generators . ]",
    "@xmath29 these couplings correspond to a chiral @xmath30-term in the 6d @xmath0 supergravity , where the relevant weyl superfield is given by @xmath31 the coupling proposed in @xcite is given by @xmath32      as already mentioned in section  [ topamp ] , there is a strong - weak coupling duality between type iia and heterotic strings in 6 dimensions : @xmath33 furthermore , the @xmath34-model metric scales with the second power of the string coupling @xmath35 thus , the coupling ( [ 6dcoupling ] ) is mapped under duality to @xmath36 which is basically established by counting the metric factors in a similar way as in section [ sec : nonren ] .",
    "hence , we see that a genus @xmath23 amplitude on the type iia side is mapped to a genus @xmath37 loop amplitude in the heterotic theory .",
    "this result raises the following question : since the regularization procedure in section [ sec : topamp6d ] is not unique ( recall that we just considered one specific insertion of additional operators ) , are there other @xmath3 topological amplitudes with similar properties as in @xmath0 , namely , that they map to a 1-loop integral on the heterotic side ?      in order to answer this question , we change the space - time dimensionality by compactifying two additional directions on a torus",
    ". the resulting manifold @xmath38 has @xmath39 , so that the background charge deficit now matches precisely .",
    "we can write again candidates for topological amplitudes .",
    "the first guess is @xcite @xmath40 in the same way as ( [ top2 ] ) can be derived from ( [ top1 ] ) , one can rewrite ( [ fg1 ] ) in the form @xmath41    the physical amplitude which is computed by this correlation function involves two self - dual and two anti - self - dual 4d riemann tensors , as well as @xmath42 self - dual graviphotons : @xmath43 performing as before the duality map , we find @xmath44 implying a two loop integral representation on the heterotic side , which is still rather difficult to compute .",
    "the question then remains , if one can still do better and find an expression which maps to a 1-loop integration .",
    "the modifications which realize this goal are to replace the two anti - self - dual gravitons by ( second ) derivatives of the graviscalar partner of the graviton in the @xmath3 gravity multiplet , and to shift the loop order on the type ii side from @xmath23 to @xmath37 @xcite : @xmath45 the topological correlation function corresponding to this string amplitude reads : @xmath46 where @xmath47 stands for the ( complex ) fermionic coordinate of the torus , whose sole purpose is to soak the remaining zero modes .",
    "this fermion appears in the @xmath0 @xmath7 current of @xmath48 : @xmath49 after the topological twist , it has conformal dimension zero : @xmath50=0 $ ] , @xmath51=1 $ ] .",
    "expression ( [ fg3 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath52    performing again the duality map to the heterotic side , one finds : @xmath53 yielding finally a 1-loop heterotic integral .        in section [ n4scfalg6d ]",
    "we have considered a special superconformal algebra by picking a fixed @xmath0 subalgebra inside @xmath3 . as was exploited in @xcite ,",
    "this choice however is not unique , but there is a freedom of different choices , related by @xmath54 transformations .",
    "this means in particular that we are free to do the following redefinitions @xmath55 where @xmath56 are parameters obeying the normalization @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , together with their counterparts from the right movers , @xmath58 , they can be interpreted as coordinates in a @xmath0 harmonic superspace , associated to the coset @xmath59 .",
    "replacing now all operators in ( [ top1 ] ) by their corresponding redefined ( hatted ) quantities , the correlation function becomes a polynomial in @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( for simplicity , we only display the left moving part ) : @xmath62    moreover , adding the following perturbation to the action @xmath63 it was shown that the following two equations hold  @xcite @xmath64 generalizing @xmath0 holomorphicity .",
    "remarkably , these equations are exact , in the sense that there is no anomaly ( or more importantly contact terms ) modifying them .",
    "this is an important difference from the @xmath0 holomorphicity relation ( [ holoanom ] ) . ]",
    "which are however spoiled by the presence of contact terms , appearing in addition to an anomaly ( boundary contributions ) . ]      generalizing the harmonicity relation for the topological @xmath3 amplitudes on @xmath38 , one encounters an extra difficulty due to the presence of ramond - ramond fields for the realization of the full @xmath65 @xmath66-symmetry of the superconformal algebra . to avoid this problem , one can make use of the heterotic dual representation of the topological amplitude @xmath67 in ( [ fg3 ] ) , in terms of a 1-loop torus integration . as was shown in @xcite , this amplitude",
    "is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the teichmller parameter of the world - sheet torus with @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are the left and right momenta of the @xmath72 compactification lattice .",
    "@xmath73 is the dedekind - eta function , and @xmath74 is the @xmath75-th term in the @xmath76-expansion of the following generating functional @xmath77 , which was computed in @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the usual odd theta - function .    in order to determine the harmonicity relation , we first introduce harmonic superspace variables @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( together with their conjugates @xmath82 ) parameterizing the coset manifold @xmath83 each of the @xmath84 transforms in the fundamental representation of @xmath65 and they differ only by their charges with respect to the three @xmath7 s .",
    "we then pick up two of them ( say @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) to project the graviphoton vertices of the amplitude : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the space - time bosonic and fermionic coordinates , respectively , while @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the six internal ones . here , we used the fact that the vector of @xmath92 can be expressed as antisymmetric tensor product of two @xmath65 fundamentals , to define for instance @xmath93 , where @xmath94 are the @xmath95 part of the @xmath92 gamma matrices and @xmath96 is the charge conjugation matrix such that @xmath97 . consequently , replacing all @xmath42 graviphoton vertices @xmath98 of @xmath99 with the projected ones renders the amplitude a function of @xmath100 .    defining furthermore the covariant derivatives @xmath101 with respect to the moduli @xmath102 , by inserting the corresponding marginal @xmath103 operators",
    "@xmath104 : @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the right - moving currents , one can show the equation @xmath107 since the right - hand side contains only @xmath108 ( of lower genus than in the left - hand side ) , this term can be interpreted as an anomaly , just as in the @xmath0 case .",
