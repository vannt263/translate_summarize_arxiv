    "nearly a half - century has passed since the first observations of x - ray emission from accretion - powered x - ray pulsars . in these sources ,",
    "the gravitational potential energy of the accreting gas is efficiently converted into kinetic energy in an accretion column that is collimated by the strong magnetic field ( @xmath0 g ) . since the surface of the neutron star represents a nearly impenetrable barrier ,",
    "the kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy at the bottom of the column , and escapes through the column walls in the form of x - rays .",
    "hence the emergent x - ray luminosity , @xmath1 , is essentially equal to the accretion luminosity , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the stellar mass and radius , respectively , and @xmath5 is the accretion rate . the x - ray emission is generated along the column and in the vicinity of one or both of the magnetic polar caps , thereby forming `` hot spots '' on the stellar surface .",
    "the x - rays were initially thought to emerge as fan - shaped beams near the base of the accretion column , but it soon became clear that a pencil beam component was sometimes necessary in order to obtain adequate agreement with the observed pulse profiles ( tsuruta & rees 1974 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & komberg 1976 ; tsuruta 1975 ) .",
    "analysis of x - ray pulsar spectra is usually performed by averaging over many rotation periods to obtain phase - averaged profiles .",
    "the resulting spectra are characterized by a power - law continuum extending up to a high - energy exponential ( thermal ) cutoff at @xmath6kev .",
    "the spectra also frequently display putative cyclotron absorption features ( used to estimate the magnetic field strength ) , and a broadened iron emission line at @xmath7kev ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "1983 ; coburn et al .",
    "2002 ) .    until recently , attempts to simulate the spectra of accretion - powered x - ray pulsars using first - principles physical models did not yield good agreement with the observed spectra .",
    "the earliest spectral models were based on the emission of blackbody radiation from the hot spots , and these were unable to reproduce the nonthermal power - law continuum .",
    "the presence of the cyclotron absorption feature led to the development of more sophisticated models based on a static slab geometry , in which the emitted spectrum is strongly influenced by cyclotron scattering ( e.g. , mszros & nagel 1985a , b ; nagel 1981 ; yahel 1980b ) .",
    "while the magnetized slab models are able to roughly fit the shape of the observed cyclotron absorption features , they remained unable to reproduce the nonthermal power - law x - ray continuum .",
    "the lack of a physics - based model for the formation of x - ray pulsar spectra led to the characterization of the observed spectra using parameters derived from a variety of _ ad hoc _ functional forms .",
    "coburn et al . (",
    "2002 ) describe in detail three analytical functions commonly used to empirically model the x - ray continuum .",
    "the first function is the power law with high - energy cutoff ( plcut ) , given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the x - ray energy , @xmath10 is the photon spectral index , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the cutoff and folding energies , respectively . the second function ( tanaka 1986 ) uses the same power law index @xmath10 , combined with a fermi - dirac form for the high - energy cutoff ( fdco ) , defined by @xmath13 the third function ( mihara 1995 ) uses two power laws , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in combination with an exponential cutoff ( npex ) , written as @xmath16",
    "although these functional forms have no physical basis , they are often used to characterize the observed spectral shapes .    in later work",
    ", it eventually became clear that the observed power - law continuum was the result of a combination of bulk and thermal comptonization occurring inside the accretion column .",
    "the first physically - motivated model based on these principles , that successfully described the shape of the x - ray continuum in accretion - powered pulsars , was developed by becker & wolff ( 2007 , hereafter bw07 ) .",
    "this new model allowed for the first time the computation of the x - ray spectrum emitted through the walls of the accretion column based on the solution of a fundamental radiation - transport equation .",
    "the bw07 model was recently ported to _",
    "xspec _ using a model described by wolff et al .",
    "another variation of the original bw07 model was developed and utilized by farinelli et al .",
    "( 2012 ; 2016 , hereafter f16 ) , which added an additional second - order scattering term to the transport equation related to the bulk flow .",
    "it is important to note that the wolff et al .",
    "( 2016 ) and farinelli et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2016 ) implementations were premised on the utilization of an approximate form for the accretion velocity profile , which was assumed to stagnate at the stellar surface while varying in proportion to the scattering optical depth measured from the stellar surface .",
    "this approximate velocity profile stagnates at the stellar surface as required , but it does not follow the exact expected variation with altitude ( becker 1998 ) .    while the bw07 and f16 models have demonstrated notable success in fitting the observed x - ray spectra for higher luminosity sources , these analytical models do not include all of the fundamental hydrodynamic and thermodynamic processes occurring within the accretion column .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask how the incorporation of additional physics would impact the ability of the bw07-type models to fit the observed x - ray spectra",
    ". this has motivated us to investigate the importance of additional radiative and hydrodynamical physics within the context of a detailed numerical simulation .",
    "the new simulation includes the implementation of a realistic dipole geometry , rigorous physical boundary conditions , and self - consistent energy transfer between electrons , ions , and radiation . in particular , we explore the dynamical effect of the gas pressure , which was neglected by bw07 and f16 , in order to examine how the radiation and gas pressures combine to determine the dynamical structure of the accretion column and the associated radius - dependent and vertically - integrated , partially - occulted x - ray spectra .",
    "this is the second in a series of two papers in which we describe the new coupled radiative - hydrodynamical model .",
    "the integrated approach involves an iteration between an ode - based hydrodynamical code that determines the dynamical structure , and a pde - based radiative code that computes the radiation spectrum .",
    "the iterative process converges rapidly to yield a self - consistent and unique description of the dynamical structure of the accretion column and the energy distribution in the emergent radiation field . in west",
    "( 2016 , hereafter paper i ) , we focus on solving the coupled hydrodynamical conservation equations to describe the underlying gas and radiation hydrodynamics within the accretion column .",
    "we employed _ mathematica _ to solve the set of nonlinear hydrodynamical equations in dipole coordinates to determine the accreting bulk fluid velocity , the electron and ion temperature profiles , and the variation of the energy flux .",
    "in this paper ( paper ii ) we focus on solving the fundamental pde photon transport equation to describe the production of the observed radius - dependent and phase - averaged x - ray spectra .",
    "the bulk velocity and electron temperature profiles developed using the _ mathematica _ calculation described in paper i are used as input for the analysis conducted here , in which we solve the pde photon transport equation using the _ comsol _ multiphysics module .",
    "the iterative dual - platform calculation is based on the transfer of information between the _ comsol _ radiation spectrum calculation and the _ mathematica _ hydrodynamical structure calculation . using this iterative approach",
    ", we are able to model realistic x - ray pulsar accretion columns in dipole geometry by solving the photon transport equation using self - consistent spatial distributions for the accretion velocity profile @xmath17 and the electron temperature profile @xmath18 .",
    "our self - consistent model for the hydrodynamics and the radiative transfer occurring in x - ray pulsar accretion flows is based on a fundamental set of conservation equations governing the flow velocity , @xmath17 , the bulk fluid mass density , @xmath19 , the radiation energy density , @xmath20 , the ion energy density , @xmath21 , the electron energy density , @xmath22 , and the total radial energy transport rate , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the radius measured from the center of the neutron star . in our hydrodynamical model ,",
    "the field - aligned flow is decelerated by the combined pressure of the ions , the electrons , and the radiation . the total pressure is therefore given by the sum @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the electron , ion , and radiation pressures , respectively .",
    "the equations - of - state for the material components are @xmath29 we note that in the x - ray pulsar application , the value of @xmath28 can not be computed using a thermal relation because in general the radiation field is not in thermal equilibrium with either the matter or itself .",
    "hence the radiation pressure must be computed using an appropriate conservation relation .",
    "the corresponding energy densities are related to the pressure components via @xmath30 where ( see paper i ) we set @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the ratio of specific heats for the radiation field is given by @xmath33 .",
    "as shown in paper  i , the mathematical model can be reduced to a set of five coupled , first - order , nonlinear ordinary differential equations satisfied by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and the ion , electron , and radiation sound speeds , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively , defined by @xmath39 the ion and electron temperatures , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , are related to the corresponding sound speeds via @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the ion and electron masses , respectively , and @xmath45 . we assume here that the accreting gas is composed of pure , fully - ionized hydrogen .      here , we briefly review the hydrodynamical conservation equations and the underlying model assumptions .",
    "the fundamental independent variables in our model are the photon energy , @xmath46 , and the radius , @xmath24 , measured from the center of the star . since our model includes only one explicit spatial dimension , the structure across the column at a given value of @xmath24 is not treated in detail .",
    "therefore , all of the physical quantities ( velocity , temperature , pressure , flux , and density ) developed here are interpreted as mean values across the column ( see appendix [ section : photon escape formalism ] ) .",
    "the mass continuity equation can be written in dipole geometry as ( e.g. , langer & rappaport 1982 ) @xmath47 \\ , \\label{eqn : mass flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 denotes the radial inflow velocity , and the cross - sectional area of the column , @xmath49 , is related to the solid angle @xmath50 subtended by the dipole column at radius @xmath24 , by @xmath51 the solid angle subtended by the column at the stellar surface is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the inner and outer polar angles of the accretion column at the stellar surface , respectively .",
    "when @xmath55 , the column is completely filled ; otherwise , the central portion of the column is empty .",
    "we therefore find that the solid angle varies with radius according to @xmath56 in a steady - state situation , the mass accretion rate @xmath5 is conserved , and is related to the density @xmath57 and velocity @xmath34 via @xmath58 combining equations  ( [ eqn : omega ] ) and ( [ eqn : dipolarmassflux ] ) , we find that the variation of the mass density @xmath57 is given by @xmath59 under the assumption that the accreting gas is composed of pure , fully - ionized hydrogen , the electron and ion number densities are equal and can be computed using @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the total energy flux in the radial direction , averaged over the column cross - section at radius @xmath24 , can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the electron - scattering cross section for photons propagating parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the flux @xmath64 is defined to be negative for energy flow in the downward direction , towards the stellar surface , and the corresponding accretion velocity @xmath34 is negative ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the terms on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eqn : energyflux ] ) represent the kinetic energy flux , the enthalpy flux , the radiation diffusion flux , and the gravitational energy flux , respectively .",
    "the diffusion of radiation energy through the walls is given by @xmath66 and is modeled using an escape - probability formalism .",
    "the value of the energy transport rate @xmath35 varies as a function of the radius @xmath24 in response to the escape of radiation perpendicular to the magnetic field direction .",
    "we therefore utilize a total energy conservation equation of the form @xmath67 where @xmath35 is the total energy transport rate in the radial direction , defined by @xmath68 and the mean escape timescale , @xmath69 , is discussed in section  [ sec : photon transport equation ] and in appendix  [ section : photon escape formalism ] .",
    "it is convenient to work in terms of non - dimensional radius , flow velocity , sound speed , and total energy transport rate variables by introducing the quantities @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the gravitational radius , defined by @xmath72 the computational domain extends from the top of the accretion column , at radius @xmath73 , down to the stellar surface at dimensionless radius @xmath74 , which is based on canonical values for the stellar mass , @xmath75 , and the stellar radius , @xmath76 km .",
    "the set of five fundamental hydrodynamical differential equations that must be solved simultaneously using _ mathematica _ comprises equations  ( [ eqn : radiationodetilde ] ) , ( [ eqn : ionodetilde ] ) , ( [ eqn : electronodetilde ] ) , ( [ eqn : energyodetilde ] ) , and ( [ eqn : velocityodetilde ] ) , which were described in detail in paper i and are shown here as @xmath77 \\right \\ } \\ , \\label{eqn : velocityodetilde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the cross - sectional area @xmath49 of the dipole accretion column is given by equation  ( [ eqn : area ] ) .",
    "the ions do not radiate appreciably , and therefore the ion energy density is only affected by adiabatic compression and coulomb energy exchange with the electrons ( see langer & rappaport 1982 ) .",
    "conversely , the electrons experience free - free , cyclotron , and compton heating and cooling , in addition to adiabatic compression and the coulomb exchange of energy with the ions .",
    "the radiation energy density responds to both the creation and absorption of photons via free - free and cyclotron processes , in addition to compton scattering with the electrons .",
    "the thermal coupling terms in equations  ( [ eqn : ionodetilde ] ) , ( [ eqn : electronodetilde ] ) , and ( [ eqn : velocityodetilde ] ) describe a comprehensive set of electron and ion heating and cooling processes which are broken down as follows , @xmath78 the terms in the expression for @xmath79 denote , respectively , thermal bremsstrahlung ( free - free ) emission and absorption , cyclotron emission and absorption , the compton exchange of energy between the electrons and photons , and electron - ion coulomb energy exchange . in our sign convention ,",
    "a heating term is positive and a cooling term is negative .",
    "the mathematical descriptions of each term in equation  ( [ eqn : udottotal ] ) are provided in paper  i. we note that the term @xmath80 plays a fundamental role in the energy exchange between photons and electrons , as discussed in detail below and in section  [ sec : photon transport equation ] .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung emission plays a significant role in cooling the ionized gas , and in the case of luminous x - ray pulsars , it also provides the majority of the seed photons that are subsequently compton scattered to form the emergent x - ray spectrum .",
    "the electrons in the accretion column experience heating due to free - free absorption of low - frequency radiation , and they also experience heating and cooling due to the absorption and emission of thermal cyclotron radiation .",
    "these emission and absorption processes can play an important role in regulating the temperature of the gas . on average , however , cyclotron absorption does not result in net heating of the gas , due to the subsequently rapid radiative de - excitation , and we therefore set @xmath81 in our dynamical calculations .",
    "near the surface of the accretion column , however , photons scattered out of the outwardly directed beam are not replaced , and this leads to the formation of the observed cyclotron absorption feature in a process that is very analogous to the formation of absorption lines in the solar spectrum ( ventura et al . 1979 ) . while cyclotron absorption does not result in net heating of the gas , due to the rapid radiative de - excitation , cyclotron emission will cool the gas .",
    "the electrons can also be heated or cooled via coulomb collisions with the protons , depending on whether the electron temperature @xmath41 exceeds the ion temperature @xmath40 .",
    "compton scattering plays a fundamental role in the formation of the emergent x - ray spectrum .",
    "it is critically important in establishing the radial variation of the electron temperature profile through the exchange of energy between photons and electrons .",
    "the compton cooling rate , prior to dimensionless units conversion , is expressed in terms of the mass density , @xmath57 , the electron sound speed , @xmath37 , and the radiation sound speed , @xmath38 .",
    "the complete derivation of the electron cooling rate due to compton scattering is given in section  [ subsection : transport phenomena and photon - electron energetics ] , and the final result is given by ( see equation  ( [ eqn : compton6b ] ) ) @xmath82 u_r(r ) \\",

    "equation  ( [ eqn : udotcompton2a ] ) can be stated in terms of the sound speeds as @xmath86 the sign of @xmath80 depends on the value of @xmath87 .",
    "the electrons experience compton cooling if @xmath88 ( i.e. @xmath89 ) ; otherwise , the electrons are heated via inverse - compton scattering .",
    "our task is to solve the five coupled hydrodynamic conservation equations , shown in equations (    [ eqn : radiationodetilde])-([eqn : velocityodetilde ] ) above , to determine the radial profiles of the dynamic variables @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , subject to the boundary conditions discussed in section  [ subsection : boundary conditions ] and section  [ subsection : transport boundary conditions ] .",
    "once these profiles are available , the electron temperature @xmath41 can be computed from the electron sound speed @xmath92 using the relation ( see equation ( [ eqn : temperatureconversion ] ) ) @xmath93 the solutions for @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the fundamental output of the solved system of conservation equations .",
    "these are used as input to the _ comsol _ finite - element environment in order to compute the photon distribution function , @xmath96 , inside the column , which is the focus of this paper .",
    "solving the five coupled conservation equations to determine the radial profiles of the quantities @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 requires an iterative approach , because the rate of compton energy exchange between the photons and the electrons depends on the relationship between the electron temperature , @xmath41 , and the inverse - compton temperature , @xmath97 , which is determined by the shape of the radiation distribution ( see equation  ( [ eqn : compton7 ] ) ) . in order to achieve a self - consistent solution for all of the flow variables , while taking into account the feedback loop between the dynamical calculation and the radiative transfer calculation , the simulation must iterate through a specific sequence of steps .",
    "the steps required in a single iteration are : ( 1 ) the computation of the initial estimate of the accretion column dynamical structure , which is obtained by solving the five conservation equations described in paper  i under the assumption that @xmath98 ; ( 2 ) calculation of the associated radiation distribution function by solving the radiative transfer equation described here in paper  ii ; ( 3 ) computation of the inverse - compton temperature profile @xmath99 based on integration of the radiation energy distribution using equation  ( [ eqn : compton7 ] ) ; and ( 4 ) re - computation of the dynamical structure using the new estimate for @xmath99 .",
    "the iteration continues until adequate convergence is achieved between successive temperature profiles for all values of @xmath24 .",
    "the iterative process is discussed in detail in paper i , and also in section  [ subsection : convergence ] of this paper .      here",
    "we summarize the set of boundary conditions utilized in the _ mathematica _ integration of the set of hydrodynamical conservation equations , required in order to determine the structure of the accretion column . at the top of the accretion column ( radius @xmath100 ) , the inflow velocity @xmath34 equals the local free - fall velocity , so that @xmath101 we also assume that the local acceleration of the gas is equal to the gravitational value , and therefore @xmath102 at the upper surface of the dipole - shaped accretion funnel , the radiation escapes freely , forming a `` pencil - beam '' component in the observed radiation field . this physical principle can be used to derive a useful boundary condition at the upper surface of the accretion column .",
    "the radial component of the radiation energy flux , averaged over the cross - section of the column at radius @xmath24 , is given in the diffusion approximation by ( see equation  ( [ eqn : total radiation flux equation ] ) ) @xmath103 where the first term on the right - hand side represents the upward diffusion of radiation energy parallel to the magnetic field , and the second term represents the downward advection of radiation energy towards the stellar surface ( with @xmath65 ) . the fact that the top of the accretion column is the last scattering surface implies that the photon transport makes a transition from diffusion to free streaming at @xmath104 , and therefore we make the following replacement in equation  ( [ eqn : radiation energy flux ] ) at the upper boundary , @xmath105 we incorporate equation ( [ eqn : free - streaming ] ) into equation  ( [ eqn : radiation energy flux ] ) to conclude that the radiation energy flux at the upper surface is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the free - fall velocity given by equation  ( [ eqn : free - fall top ] ) .",
    "the ionized gas flows downward after entering the top of the accretion funnel at radius @xmath104 , and eventually passes through a standing , radiation - dominated shock , where most of the kinetic energy is radiated away through the walls of the accretion column ( becker 1998 ) . below the shock , the gas passes through a sinking regime , where the remaining kinetic energy is radiated away ( basko & sunyaev 1976 ) . ultimately , the flow stagnates at the stellar surface , and the accreting matter merges with the stellar crust .",
    "the surface of the neutron star is too dense for radiation to penetrate significantly ( lenzen & trmper 1978 ) , and therefore the sum of the diffusion and the advection components of the radiation energy flux must vanish there .",
    "furthermore , due to the stagnation of the flow at the stellar surface , the advection component should also vanish , and we conclude the radiation energy flux @xmath108 as @xmath109 . we refer to this as the  mirror \" surface boundary condition , which can be written as @xmath110 we approximate stagnation at the stellar surface in our simulations using the condition @xmath111",

    "the partially - occulted spectra are interpreted as resulting from the rotation of the pulsar , which causes various portions of the accretion column to disappear behind the neutron star .",
    "although the partially - occulted spectra gives some hints into how the rotation of the star would affect the observed spectrum , we can not make any definitive conclusions in the absence of a complete model for the stellar rotation and the emission geometry , including the angle between the spin axis and the line of sight to the observer , and also the angle between the spin axis and the radiating magnetic pole ( or poles ) .",
    "such a model should also include the effects of general relativistic light bending , and also the effect of the directional dependence of the cyclotron absorption and emission processes occurring in the outer sheath of the column surface .",
    "a calculation of this type is beyond the scope of the present paper , but we plan to pursue the development of a complete geometrical picture in future work .    the results obtained here for the partially - occulted spectra establish that the largest spectral contributions occur near the radiation sonic surface .",
    "we find that the observed spectra are essentially generated in the last few kilometers above the stellar surface , where the @xmath316-parameters exceed unity and thermal comptonizaton dominates .",
    "the sequence of partially - occulted spectra plotted for each source demonstrate that the observed spectra are due to emission escaping from altitudes between the column top and the thermal mound .",
    "the escape of photos from altitudes below the top of the thermal mound makes a negligible contribution to the total spectra , due to the dense atmosphere in the extended sinking regime , where the parallel absorption optical depth exceeds unity , and most of the photons are absorbed .    ) and ( [ eqn : wall phase - averaged photon count rate spectrum ] ) , respectively.,width=595 ]    the two - dimensional approximations employed in the wang & frank ( 1981 ) model suggest that @xmath386% of the observed radiation escapes in the fan - beam component , with only @xmath387% contributed by the pencil beam . as these authors note , the principal weakness of their model is the lack of any implementation of energy exchange between the photons and the plasma .",
    "our model results establish that the fan - beam contribution generally dominates over the pencil beam , although this can be violated in the vicinity of the cyclotron absorption energy .",
    "we also note that the new model provides additional radius - dependent and energy - dependent information based upon realistic physics within the column , which is unavailable in the model of wang & frank ( 1981 ) .",
    "langer & rappaport ( 1982 ) developed a hydrodynamical model for accretion flows in lower luminosity x - ray pulsars ( @xmath388 ) .",
    "their model includes a partial implementation of the energy exchange processes linking the photons with the plasma , but it does not treat the radiation transfer problem in detail . a major goal of our work has been to properly model the interactions between the gas and the radiation due to thermal emission and absorption , cyclotron emission and absorption , and compton scattering . hence our model provides a self - consistent description of the hydrodynamics , the thermodynamics , and the radiative transfer occurring in the accretion column .",
    "our results suggest that , even for low - luminosity sources , the coupling of the radiation with the matter via compton energy transfer can have a profound effect on the electron temperature profile .",
    "bykov & krassilchtchikov ( 2004 ) also computed the hydrodynamics of a 1d , two - fluid model in a dipole magnetic field geometry for low - luminosity sources .",
    "while they go one step further than langer & rappaport ( 1982 ) by adopting a cyclotron diffusion approximation to treat the radiation transport , they do not account for the fundamental effects of bulk and thermal comptonization , nor do they include bremsstrahlung or blackbody source photons .",
    "we can gain further insight into the relative importance of the pencil- and fan - beam components in forming the observed spectra of the x - ray pulsars treated here . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratio spectral flux emission geometry ] we plot emission ratio curves , formed by dividing the emitted pencil - beam photon spectrum by the column - integrated ( phase - averaged ) fan - beam photon spectrum for her x-1 ( blue ) , cen x-3 ( black ) , and lmc x-4 ( green ) . in general , for all three sources , the emission from the wall ( fan ) component exceeds that escaping from the column top ( pencil ) component , except within a narrow energy range centered on the cyclotron absorption feature .",
    "the total observed photon energy and number fluxes associated with the pencil and fan components can be calculated by integrating the respective spectra over the energy band from @xmath151 to @xmath152 .",
    "the observed total number flux emitted in the fan - beam component , emanating through the column walls , is calculated using @xmath389 where @xmath390 is given by equation ( [ eqn : phase - averaged photon count rate spectrum ] ) .",
    "the corresponding observed total energy flux is given by @xmath391 likewise , the total observed number flux due to the pencil - beam emission escaping from the top of the column is given by @xmath392 where @xmath393 is evaluated using equation ( [ eqn : top photon count rate spectrum ] ) .",
    "the corresponding total energy flux is computed using @xmath394 the four observed fluxes , calculated using equations ( [ eqn : photon number flux wall ] ) - ( [ eqn : photon energy flux top ] ) , are listed for each source in table  [ tab : emission geometry ] , separated into the contributions due to the pencil - beam and fan - beam components .    in general , the majority of the energy and number fluxes is contributed by the fan beam , although in the case of lmc x-4 , the pencil beam number flux is comparable to the fan beam contribution .    .",

    "however , there are also numerous modifications that would facilitate a more detailed investigation of the partially - occulted and phase - averaged spectra and associated spectral properties . for example , as mentioned earlier , our preliminary results for cen x-3 and lmc x-4 suggest that modification of the stellar mass and radius may improve the agreement between the cyclotron absorption imprint radius , @xmath253 , and the radius at which the luminosity per unit length ( @xmath315 ) is maximized , denoted by @xmath314 . in principle , we would expect these two radii to agree .",
    "changes in the crsf line energy and x - ray continuum can be studied by varying the accretion rate , @xmath5 , over a specific range , which may provide new insights into the observed correlation between the cyclotron line energy and the x - ray luminosity ( mihara et al .",

    "( 2016 ) , we would need to replace the 2d cyclotron gaussian with a true energy - dependent cyclotron absorption term in both the hydrodynamic and photon transport equations .",
    "this should facilitate calculation of the x - ray power - law continuum for any accretion rate , resulting in correlative studies of the hardness ratio with variations of the source luminosity ( postnov et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "we have assumed in our model that the dipole magnetic field component dominates over the full length of the accretion column .",
    "however , the possible presence of a magnetic quadrupole component may significantly influence the overall field geometry ( shakura et al .",
    "1991 ; panchenko & postnov 1994 ) , which could substantially modify the locations and shapes of the primary emission regions , and the accompanying emission characteristics ( jardine et al . 2006 ; gregory et al . 2006 ; long et al . 2007 ;",
    "donati et al .",
    "2007b ; long et al .",
    "for example , if the quadrupole component is aligned with the dipole , then the accreting matter may impact the surface as a ring rather than a disk ( postnov et al . 2013 ) . this particular possibility",
    "is included implicitly in our model , at least qualitatively , since we allow for a partially - filled column , in which case the matter impacts the surface in a ring configuration .",
    "however , if the quadrupole component is misaligned with the dipole component , then the accretion structure is likely to be much more complex and asymmetric .",
    "the treatment of that type of asymmetric structure would require the development of a two - dimensional spatial model , which is beyond the scope of the work presented here , but it could possibly be developed in the future .",
    "the results we have obtained for the partially - occulted spectra plotted in figures  [ fig : her x-1 radius - dependent and partially - occulted spectra ] , [ fig : cen x-3 radius - dependent and partially - occulted spectra ] , and [ fig : lmc x-4 radius - dependent and partially - occulted spectra ] provide motivation for future studies employing a more realistic source geometry , including the possibility of a quadrupole magnetic field component , which may alter the pulse profiles , as discussed in the context of her x-1 by postnov et al .
