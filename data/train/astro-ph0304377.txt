    "if the rate of gravitational lenses among known quasars is roughly 0.1% of all quasars ( turner , ostriker & gott 1984 ) , the expected number of new gravitationally lensed quasars in the sloan digital sky survey s ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) final spectroscopic quasar sample will be approximately @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the entire sdss photometric sample may contain an order of magnitude more lensed systems ( since the photometric observations reliably probe @xmath6 mag fainter than the spectroscopic sample ) .",
    "the sdss is a project to conduct parallel photometric and spectroscopic surveys of 10,000 deg@xmath7 of the sky centered approximately on the north galactic pole , using a dedicated wide - field 2.5-m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) in new mexico , usa .",
    "photometric observations are done in five broad optical bands ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , centered at 3561 , 4676 , 6176 , 7494 , and 8873 respectively ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ; stoughton et al .",
    "the imaging camera consists of a 5@xmath136 array of large photometric ccds ( 2048@xmath132048 pixels ) and 24 astrometric ccds ( 2048@xmath13128 pixels ) ( gunn et al .",
    "the imaging data are reduced by the photometric pipeline ( lupton et al .",
    "2001 ) using information from the astrometric pipeline ( pier et al . 2002 ) and the 0.5-m photometric calibration telescope ( hogg et al . 2001 ; smith et al . 2002 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations are done with a multi - fiber spectrograph covering 3800 to 9200 with the resolution r@xmath141800 .",
    "we are interested in using the sdss to find new lensed quasars since they have proven to be useful for cosmological tests , especially for the measurement of the cosmological constant by the number counts of lensed quasars ( fukugita & turner 1991 ) as well as the measurement of the hubble constant by observations of the time delay between multiple components ( refsdal 1964 ) .",
    "finding new lensed quasars in a large , homogeneous survey , such as the sdss will contribute greatly to the statistics of lensed quasars ( useful for measurements of the cosmological constant ) and the determination of their time delays ( useful for constraining the hubble constant ) .",
    "to date the sdss has yielded one new two - image lensed quasar , sdss 1226@xmath00006a , b ( inada et al . 2002 ) and here we report on the second lensed quasar system discovered among the sdss quasars .    to maximize the likelihood of discovering additional lens systems , we are studying the sdss parameters of previously known lensed quasars .",
    "in particular , we studied the parameters of sdss j1226@xmath00006 , and using these parameters we developed an algorithm to select sdss 1226-like objects from the sdss database .",
    "this algorithm should be sensitive to lensed quasars with separations on the order of @xmath15 to @xmath16 . applying this algorithm to the approximately 10,000 sdss quasars discovered prior to 2001 december 1 , we identified five lensed quasar candidates . by definition one of them is sdss 1226@xmath00006 .",
    "another candidate is sdss  j0924 + 0219 ( 09@xmath17 24@xmath18 55@xmath1987 , + 02@xmath20 19@xmath21 @xmath22 , j2000 ) which is identified as a @xmath1 quasar in the sdss database .",
    "we obtained photometric follow - up observations of sdss  j0924 + 0219 using the magellan consortium s walter baade 6.5-m ( wb6.5 m ) telescope at las campanas observatory under good seeing conditions ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "additional spectroscopic observations of the components that were resolved by the wb6.5 m images were obtained with the keck ii telescope at the w. m. keck observatory on mauna kea in @xmath24 seeing .",
    "observations of the three other candidates from this sample have been taken with the wb6.5 m telescope and indicate that these systems are also likely to be lensed quasars ; these systems will be discussed in future papers .",
    "section 2 of this paper briefly describes the new algorithm which led to the discovery of sdss0924 + 0219 .",
    "section 3 describes the follow - up observations and show the results of them . in   4 , we discuss some of the interesting aspects of this system .",
    "finally , we present a summary of this paper in   5 .",
    "we now describe the manner in which sdss  j0924 + 0219 was selected as a gravitational lens candidate based upon the object parameters in the sdss object catalog ( lupton et al .",
    "first , we selected objects that were confirmed to be quasars in the sdss spectroscopic survey ( see richards et al .",
    "2002 for details of the sdss quasar target selection algorithm ) .",
    "we rejected quasars whose redshifts are less than 0.6 since many low - redshift quasars are extended objects ( schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) , making it hard to distinguish them from unresolved lensed quasars .",
    "next , we restricted our lensed quasar candidate sample using some sdss catalogued parameters , specifically the galaxy profile fitting likelihood . as the sdss data are passed through the data reduction pipelines , each extended object",
    "is fitted with a set of possible galaxy profiles ( lupton et al . 2001 ) and labeled with the likelihood that each profile explains the data .",
    "these likelihoods are useful for searching for extended quasars , so we optimized our search criteria to use these values , based on our study of the first sdss lensed quasar , sdss j1226@xmath00006 .",
    "this algorithm targets lensed quasars whose separations are approximately @xmath25 , because we empirically confirmed that lensed quasars whose separations are less than 10 do not have large `` extended '' parameters in the sdss object catalog ; we can not distinguish these small separation lensed quasars from single , unresolved quasars . for lensed quasars that have separations of more than 25 , each lensed component should appear as a separate entity in the sdss catalog .",
    "as a result of applying this algorithm to the approximately 10,000 sdss quasars ( in @xmath26 deg@xmath27 ) , we selected five lensed quasar candidates .",
    "one of these five candidates is the first sdss lensed quasar , sdss 1226@xmath00006 , and another of these candidates is sdss  j0924 + 0219 . if the total lensing rate is roughly 0.1% of all quasars , then on the order of @xmath28 lensed quasars are expected from the approximately @xmath29 sdss quasars that were known at the start of this work .",
    "about half of the lensed quasars should have @xmath25 separations ( chiba & yoshii 1999 ) ; therefore , the result of this algorithm is consistent with the theoretical estimate . whether or",
    "not this selection algorithm is the optimal way to select moderate separation lens candidates from the sdss imaging data remains to be seen , since it could be biased towards sdss j1226@xmath00006-like lens systems .",
    "however , the successful discovery of two lensed quasars suggests that it is a reasonable method to use for our initial lens search .",
    "photometric follow - up observations of sdss  j0924 + 0219 were obtained using the wb6.5 m telescope .",
    "the data were taken on 2001 december 15 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 filters using the magellan instant camera ( magic , a 2048@xmath132048 ccd camera ) ; the seeing was 055@xmath30075 fwhm .",
    "the pixel size was 0069 .",
    "the exposure time was 300 sec in each band .",
    "each ccd frame was bias - subtracted and flat - field corrected .",
    "additional spectroscopic data were taken on 2002 january 12 with the keck ii echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sutin 1997 ) , using the mit - ll 2048@xmath134096 ccd camera and a 175 line mm@xmath2 grating .",
    "we used the echellette mode .",
    "the resolution of the echellette mode of this spectrograph is 11.4 km sec@xmath2 pixel@xmath2 .",
    "the spatial resolution scale of this spectrograph is 0153 pixel@xmath2 .",
    "the spectral range covers 3900 to 11,000 .",
    "the exposure time was 1200 sec .",
    "we set the slit direction so that two of the three components ( components a and b , see below ) were on the slit at the same time .",
    "the two components are separated by 178 and the seeing was less than 10 fwhm ; the two components are clearly distinct in the 2-dimensional esi image .",
    "the two spectra were extracted separately using the usual method of summing the flux in a window around each object and subtracting sky from neighboring windows on either side of the trace .",
    "the only difference from a simple single spectrum extraction was that we were careful to exclude the other object from the sky windows .",
    "there was no need ( and no attempt ) to fit the two spectra simultaneously because we can not see any overlap along the slit in the 2-dimensional esi image .",
    "however , flux of component d ( see below ) actually affect the component a spectrum ( we set the slit width 10 )",
    ". we could not see it in the 2-dimensional esi image , because component d is close to the component a , and is more than two magnitudes fainter than component a. the estimated contaminations are 6.0% of the flux of component a in @xmath9 band ( 4000@xmath315500 ) , 6.8% in @xmath10 band ( 5500@xmath317000 ) , and 7.4% in @xmath11 band ( 7000@xmath318500 ) , respectively .",
    "we used a single slit position that included components a and b , which puts component g ( see below ) slightly off to one side . since it is much fainter ( about 2 mag fainter than component a ) , it is not noticeable in the spectrum .",
    "the sdss images ( sky and bias subtracted and flat - field corrected ) are shown in all bands in figure  1 .",
    "total magnitudes of the five components are 18.68@xmath320.02 , 18.43@xmath320.01 , 18.34@xmath320.01 , 18.09@xmath320.01 , and 17.98@xmath320.03 in @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively , while the still preliminary 2.5-m filter - based photometry will be called @xmath38 ( stoughton et al . 2002 ) ] .",
    "these errors in the magnitudes are statistical errors .",
    "we show the full follow - up magic @xmath10 image including nearby stars ( star a , star b , and star c ) as well as sdss  j0924 + 0219 in figure  2 .",
    "the non - psfs subtracted ( hereafter `` original '' ) @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 images of sdss  j0924 + 0219 and the psf - subtracted images of each band are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the upper panels are the original images and the lower panels are the psf - subtracted images .",
    "we subtracted psfs using stars from the original images in all bands .",
    "we used star a for the @xmath8 image , star b for the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 images and star c for the @xmath9 image , respectively .",
    "the `` peak '' flux and the center coordinates of stars a , b , and c and components a , b , and c were calculated by the single gaussian fit ( these results agree with the results obtained by the `` imexamine '' task in iraf ) .",
    "we named the three stellar components `` components a ",
    "c '' according to their magnitudes , the center extended object `` component g '' and the unknown component which remains after subtracting psfs `` component d '' . the flux ratios between components a and b are 0.47 , 0.44 , 0.43 , and 0.43 in @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively , and those between components a and c are 0.44 , 0.43 , 0.41 , and 0.40 .",
    "in the original @xmath11 image one can see components g and d , both are much more prominent in the psf - subtracted images ( except for @xmath8 ) .",
    "we show the reduced @xmath39 from the psf subtraction in table  1 .",
    "the reduced @xmath39 of the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 images of component a and component c are large , because component a has contamination from components g and d , and component c has contamination from component g. we can not see components d and g in the @xmath8 psf - subtracted image .",
    "this fact suggests that component d is not a quasar but rather a galaxy .",
    "we give our estimated magnitudes and colors of the three stellar components , component g and component d in table  2 .",
    "we used stars a , b , and c as the photometric standard stars using their sdss catalog magnitudes and positions .",
    "spectra of components a and b taken with esi on keck ii are shown in figure  4 .",
    ", , , and emission lines are seen clearly ; both components are quasars at the same redshift ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the velocity difference between the two components is less than 100 km sec@xmath2 , calculated using the emission lines .",
    "the widths of the emission lines of both components are also in good agreement .",
    "we do not have a spectrum of component c , but the colors of this component indicate that this component is also a quasar .",
    "a photometric redshift can be computed for component c following richards et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , assuming an @xmath40 color of @xmath41 .",
    "the resulting photometric redshift is 1.33@xmath320.20 , which is consistent with the redshifts of components a and c , @xmath421.524 .",
    "the redshifts and the widths of the emission lines are summarized in table  3 .",
    "we calculated the celestial coordinates of components a , b , and c based on the sdss celestial coordinates of the three stars ( star a , star b , and star c , figure  2 ) common to the magic @xmath10 image and the sdss data .",
    "the separations between components a and b , b and c , and a and c are calculated to be 178@xmath32004 , 150@xmath32003 , and 114@xmath32004 , respectively .",
    "we also calculated the celestial coordinates of component g and component d after subtracting psfs .",
    "the results are summarized in table  4 .",
    "sdss  j0924 + 0219 is certainly a lensed quasar because of its morphology ( there is a galaxy between three almost same color quasars ) and the small velocity difference and the small line width differences between components a and b. however , even though there are no emission line profile differences between components a and b , the ratio of the spectra of the two quasars is not constant with @xmath43 ; it steadily decreases from 0.7 at 4000 to 0.2 at 9000 as shown in figure  5 .",
    "the flux of component d would affect the spectrum of component a , but the estimated contaminations are not large ( see   3.1 ) and it would not give a dramatically change in the spectrum of component a. the difference in the flux density ratio between the two components indicates that the two quasars might not be from the same physical source .",
    "it is possible that the slit used for the keck spectroscopic observation was not precisely aligned along the line between components a and b ; combined with differential refraction , this could have produced a spectroscopic flux density ratio different from the photometric flux ratio .",
    "however , this can not be the full explanation , since it can not explain why the spectroscopic flux ratio is not smooth ( figure  5 ) .",
    "another possibility for the differences in the spectra of the two components is that continuum variations of the source quasar combined with the differential time delay causes the wavelength dependence in the flux density ratio .",
    "continuum variations are often seen in quasars ( trvese , kron , & bunone 2001 ) , and differences in flux ratios between lensed component continua are seen in some catalogued lensed quasar systems , e.g. he 1104@xmath01805 ( wisotzki et al .",
    "1995 ) and fbq 0951 + 2635 ( schechter et al .",
    "we investigate whether the large differences between the photometric flux ratios ( see   4.1 ) and the spectroscopic flux density ratio could be caused by the continuum variations combined with the differential time delay .",
    "we estimate the time delay between components a and b using the sis model ( peacock 1999 ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are the angular size distances from observer to the source quasar , from observer to the lensing galaxy , from the lensing galaxy to the source quasar , the einstein radius in arcseconds and the redshift of the lensing galaxy , respectively .",
    "the observed separations from the center of the lensing galaxy are represented as @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we suppose the redshift of the lensing galaxy is 0.4 ( see below ) , the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy is 230 km sec@xmath2 ( see below ) , @xmath5270 km sec@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . using these parameters ,",
    "we determine a time delay of about 15 days .",
    "quasars generally do not experience large variations , such as shown in figure  4 ( or figure  5 ) , in less than 15 days , therefore , there is a significant possibility that other additional phenomena cause the differences between the two components of sdss  j0924 + 0219 .",
    "one such effect might be microlensing .",
    "we can not see clear evidence of microlensing in both spectra ( figure  4 ) , but microlensing should be universal in quadruple lens ( witt , mao , & schechter 1995 ) , therefore , it is natural that microlensing events happen to both components or to one of the two components and cause the difference between the two components ( if we suppose the same situation of q2237 + 0305 ( walsh , carswell , & weymann 1979 ) , the microlensing optical depth ( schmidt , webster , & lewis 1998 ) supports this fact ) .",
    "furthermore , if there is another object which darkens component d or component d is a second lensing galaxy ( see below discussion ) , it might have an effect on the observed spectrum of component a , i.e. the reddening of component a could be larger than that of component b. however , this extinction should be time invariant ( effectively ) , and therefore , we should see the same extinction in the the photometric flux ratios , but we can not see it . confirming spectra and direct imaging are needed to determine whether the differences between the spectroscopic and direct imaging flux ratios are real or an observational artifact .",
    "although the sis model with an external shear ( kochanek 1991 ) predicts the existence of a fourth lensed component whose amplification is as bright as the brightest of the other three lensed components , there are no stellar components except components a , b , and c in all the images ( figure  3 ) . using the positions of components a ",
    "c and of lensing galaxy g ( which of course might not be the only lensing galaxy ) we can fit the sis model with an external shear , with a projected potential : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the einstein radius of the sis model in arcseconds , @xmath10 and @xmath57 are the radial and the angular parts , respectively , of the angular position on the sky , and @xmath58 is the position angle of the shear , measured east of north . fitting this model to the positions ( but not the fluxes ) of components a  c , we get @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , with a source position ( @xmath62r.a . , @xmath62dec . ) = ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) relative to component g. this value of @xmath56 corresponds to a velocity dispersion 230 km sec@xmath2 with the estimated redshift of the lensing galaxy ( see final paragraph of this section ) .",
    "the observed positions of components a  c , the observed position of component d and the predicted positions of the lensed components are given in table  5 below . with six constraints and five free parameters it is no surprise that we obtain small residuals ( @xmath65 ) from the observed positions of components a  c .",
    "although the flux ratios of observed components were _ not _ taken as constraints , the predicted flux ratios between components a and b and between components a and c are in agreement with the observations .",
    "the predicted position of the fourth lensed component ( hereafter , component d@xmath66 ) is shown in figure  6a and figure  6b .",
    "figure  6a is the image plane of this model , and figure  6b is the enlarged part of the @xmath11 subtracted image of figure  3 with the measured positions of components a  c , component d and the predicted position of component d@xmath66 .",
    "component d is separated by only about 015 from the predicted position of component d@xmath66 ( the filled circle on figure  6a or the open circle on figure  6b ) . also , the predicted position of component d@xmath66 is within the region occupied by component d ( figure  6b ) .",
    "these results suggest that it is possible that either 1 ) component d really is the `` missing '' fourth lensed component , or 2 ) that component d is a object which is mixed component d@xmath66 ( predicted fourth lensed component ) with a foreground object that is obscuring the light from component d@xmath66 .",
    "according to schechter & wambsganss 2002 , microlensing causes demagnificating ( or vanishing ) the fourth lensed image at `` saddlepoint '' .",
    "the difference between the expected magnitude and the observed magnitude is large ( @xmath67 ) , but this marginally consistent with figure  3 of schechter & wambsganss 2002 .",
    "futhermore , some literatures reported that milli - lensing and/or micro - lensing produce anomalous flux ratios of four - image gravitationally lensed systems ( subramanian , chitre , & narasimha 1985 , metcalf & madau 2001 , keeton 2003 , and kochanek & dalal 2003 ) .",
    "the second case is also likely .",
    "if there are a foreground dusty galaxy superposed upon component d@xmath66 , it could be obscuring and reddening the light from component d@xmath66 .",
    "this might also explain why component d is bluer than component g ; component d may have some contribution from component d@xmath66 , which is expected to be relatively blue .",
    "the reduced @xmath39 of component d from the psf subtraction in the @xmath11 image is 20.91 and it is comparable with the other stellar component ( table  1 ) , therefore , there is a possibility that component d includes a stellar component .",
    "in addition to reddening by the foreground object , the demagnifying effect of microlensing might also darken component d@xmath66 , and therefore , component d might be much fainter than component d@xmath66 .",
    "two additional minor possibilities are that component d is a second lensing galaxy and contributes significantly to the lensing potential , which would change the lensing model such that the predicted position of component d@xmath66 is incorrect , and that this lensing system has a very interesting lensing potential which produces only three lensed components . according to keeton , kochanek , & seljak ( 1997 ) ; kassiola & kovner ( 1993 ) ; and wallington & narayan ( 1993 ) , there are some cases that non - singular lensing potentials with large shears , large ellipticities , or large core radii produce only three lensed component .",
    "however , sdss  j0924 + 0219 can not be explained by these standard lensing models , such as non - singular lensing potentials with large shears because components of a `` standard '' three component lensing system are expected to be on the same side of the lensing galaxy in the non - singular lens models ( kassiola & kovner 1993 ; wallington & narayan 1993 ) while the three components of sdss  j0924 + 0219 are not on the same side of the presumed lensing galaxy ( component g ) .",
    "spectroscopy of image d is just one way for the question to be resolved .",
    "higher resolution imaging , say with hst , may resolve it without any need for spectra .    according to fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa ( 1995 )",
    ", a typical elliptical galaxy at @xmath68 has @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which are close to the estimated colors of component g ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the estimated colors and the spherical appearance of component g , therefore , indicate that it may be an elliptical galaxy at @xmath68",
    ". this would be the primary lensing galaxy of this lensing system .",
    "if the redshift of the lensing galaxy is 0.4 , the @xmath71 separation of components a and b requires the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy to be about 230 km sec@xmath2 in the sis model , while the faber - jackson law predicts 225 km sec@xmath2 from the @xmath11 magnitude of this galaxy ( @xmath7220.8 ) .",
    "here we assume that @xmath73 , @xmath74 km sec@xmath2 ( blanton et al .",
    "1999 and kochanek 1996 ) , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 km sec@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , and the @xmath78-corrections of @xmath11 are 0.2 for a @xmath79 elliptical galaxy and 0.4 for a @xmath80 ( inada 2001 ) .",
    "this result favors a redshift of 0.4 for the lensing galaxy , and a velocity dispersion of about 230 km sec@xmath2 .",
    "using a selection algorithm tuned to recover a previously discovered lensed quasar ( sdss  1226@xmath00006 ) , we have identified several additional lensed quasar candidates from the sdss data .",
    "we confirmed that one of them , sdss  j0924 + 0219 , is a lensed quasar with follow - up observations using the walter baade 6.5-m and the keck ii telescopes .",
    "the redshift of the source quasar is @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum separation is @xmath3 .",
    "the velocity difference between component a and component b is very small , less than 100 km sec@xmath2 .",
    "we can directly see the lensing galaxy in the original magic @xmath11 image , and we can see it more clearly in the psf - subtracted images .",
    "the estimated colors and the magnitudes of the lensing galaxy are consistent with those of a typical elliptical galaxy at @xmath80 with a velocity dispersion of 230 km sec@xmath2 .",
    "we can see only a faint red component near the predicted position of the fourth lensed image ( using the sis model with an external shear ) .",
    "we consider that this faint red component is a fourth lensed component darkened and reddened by a foreground objects and microlensing . to settle the issue of what causes the lack of the fourth quasar component",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed quasar from the sloan digital sky survey , sdss  j092455.87 + 021924.9 ( sdss  j0924 + 0219 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this object was selected from among known sdss quasars by an algorithm that was designed to select another known sdss lensed quasar ( sdss  1226@xmath00006a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> five separate components , three of which are unresolved , are identified in photometric follow - up observations obtained with the magellan consortium s 6.5 m walter baade telescope at las campanas observatory . </S>",
    "<S> two of the unresolved components ( designated a and b ) are confirmed to be quasars with @xmath1 ; the velocity difference is less than 100 km sec@xmath2 according to spectra taken with the w. m. keck observatory s keck ii telescope on mauna kea . </S>",
    "<S> a third stellar component , designated c , has the colors of a quasar with redshift similar to components a and b. the maximum separation of the point sources is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the other two sources , designated g and d , are resolved . </S>",
    "<S> component g appears to be the best candidate for the lensing galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> although component d is near the expected position of the fourth lensed component in a four image lens system , its properties are not consistent with being the image of a quasar at @xmath4 . nevertheless , the identical redshifts of components a and b and the presence of component c strongly suggest that this object is a gravitational lens . </S>",
    "<S> our observations support the idea that a foreground object reddens the fourth lensed component and that another unmodeled effect ( such as micro- or milli - lensing ) demagnificates it , but we can not rule out the possibility that sdss0924 + 0219 is an example of the relatively rare class of `` three component '' lens systems . </S>"
