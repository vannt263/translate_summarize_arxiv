    "this simple model admits both soliton @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and black hole solutions ( see @xmath2 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) with interesting properties , the resulting picture being in strong contrast with the one found in the absence of a cosmological constant .",
    "moreover , since scalar fields generically enter the gauge supergravity models , the study of such solutions is also relevant to the ads / cft conjecture .    however , most of the studies in the literature assume that the scalar fields are real and have the same symmetries as the underlying spacetime .",
    "it is interesting to ask if the known solutions in @xcite-@xcite can be generalized for a complex scalar field . in formulating a scalar field ansatz in this case ,",

    "scalar field configurations carrying a global u(1 ) noether charge have been extensively studied in the literature , for a minkowski spacetime background and four spacetime dimensions . while black hole solutions are rather difficult to find in this case @xcite , @xcite , the spectrum of smooth horizonless solutions with harmonic time dependence is very rich .",

    "when gravity is coupled to @xmath1balls , boson stars arise ( see the review work @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in this case , solutions with rather similar properties are found even for a potential consisting in a mass term only @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the self - gravity of such objects is balanced by the dispersive effect due to the wave character of the complex scalar field .",
    "the study of boson stars and q - balls in ads spacetime has received relatively little attention , only spherically symmetric solutions being discussed so far @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see , however , the planar solitons with a complex scalar field in @xcite ) . while the results in @xcite for a gravitating massive scalar field without self - interaction are rather similar to those valid in the asymptotically flat limit , the recent study @xcite has shown the existence of some new features in the case of q - ball solutions .    for a vanishing cosmological constant , @xmath9",

    "the basic properties of the solutions are rather similar to those of the asymptotically flat counterparts .",

    "in this work we have initiated a preliminary investigation of spinning q - balls and boson stars in four dimensional ads spacetime .",
    "this study was partially motivated by the recent interest in solutions of ads gravity coupled to scalar fields only .",
    "the picture we have found has some interesting new features as compared to the well - known case of solutions with a vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "perhaps the most interesting new result is the existence of axially symmetric solitons with a smooth static limit possessing a vanishing noether charge .",
    "also , all solutions have an upper bound on frequencies , which is fixed by the scalar field mass and the cosmological constant .    moreover , we expect the existence of a much richer set of spinning scalar solitons apart from the solutions reported in this work .",
    "for example , the @xmath9 q - balls and boson stars with odd parity with respect to a reflection in the equatorial plane reported in @xcite , should allow for ads generalizations .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to construct ads ` _ twisted _ ' q - balls and boson stars , which combine features of both even and odd parity solutions @xcite . for such configurations , the scalar field is endowed with a @xmath226-dependent phase , @xmath227 , such that the amplitude of the scalar field vanishes in the equatorial plane .",
    "this would lead to a topological charge of the solutions ( see @xcite for the details of this construction in the flat spacetime case ) .",
    "also , the issue of ads vortons , @xmath29 spinning vortex loops stabilized by the centrifugal force , still remains to be investigated .",
    "the results in this work suggest that the ads picture may be very different as compared to the one found in the flat spacetime limit @xcite , @xcite .    a natural question which arises concerns the issue of higher dimensional counterparts of the solutions discussed in this paper . working in the probe limit",
    ", we have found that the general picture we have presented for @xmath102 remains valid for spinning solitons with a single angular momentum in @xmath228 dimensions .",
    "therefore we expect it to be generic for any @xmath229 .",
    "moreover , for the same self - interaction potential @xmath132 ( with @xmath135 still given by ( [ k ] ) ) , the exact q - ball solution ( [ ex - sol ] ) admits a straightforward generalization . ] for any @xmath230 , with @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "also , based on some preliminary results , we conjecture that it is possible to add a small black hole in the center of the @xmath102 solitons with a harmonic time dependence studied in this work .",
    "therefore the inclusion of rotation would allow to circumvent the no - hair results in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "indeed , such solutions were constructed recently in @xcite for @xmath12 and a complex doublet scalar field , in which case a special ansatz @xcite allows to deal with odes .",
    "we close by remarking that the study of q - balls and boson stars is interesting from yet another point of view .",
    "this type of relatively simple configurations provide an ideal ground for investigating various numerical techniques on axially symmetric problems with ads asymptotics , which thereafter can be applied to more complex models . +   + *  acknowledgements.  * we are grateful to jutta kunz for her careful reading of the manuscript and many helpful comments .",
    "we also thank burkhard kleihaus for collaboration in the initial stages of this work .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge support by the dfg , in particular , also within the dfg research training group 1620  models of gravity  .",
