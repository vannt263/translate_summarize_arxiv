    "van der waals ( vdw ) forces are non - vanishing forces between neutral , unpolarized objects that arise as a consequence of quantum ground - state fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and the interacting objects . the first theory of vdw forces within the framework of full quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) goes back to the pioneering work of casimir and polder in 1948 @xcite .",
    "using a normal - mode expansion of the quantized electromagnetic field , they derived the vdw force on a ground - state atom in front of a perfectly conducting plate as well as that between two ground - state atoms in free space .",
    "whereas the normal - mode technique requires specification of the geometry of the system at a very early point of the calculation , alternative approaches based on linear response theory allow for obtaining geometry - independent results . employing the dissipation - fluctuation theorem ,",
    "geometry - independent expressions for the vdw potentials of one and two ground - state atoms in terms of the ( classical ) green tensor of the macroscopic maxwell equations and the polarization of the atom can be derived @xcite  results that can be confirmed @xcite within the framework of exact macroscopic qed in linear , causal media @xcite .",
    "the abovementioned methods apply to atoms in free space only , because the local electromagnetic field acting on an atom situated in a medium differs from the macroscopic one due to the influence of the local medium environment of the atom . within macroscopic qed ,",
    "one approach to overcome this problem and to account for the local - field correction is the real - cavity model @xcite , where the guest atom is assumed to be surrounded by an small , empty , spherical cavity .",
    "the change of the electric field due to the presence of the cavity is then expressed via the associated green tensor that characterizes the local environment of the guest atom .",
    "the real - cavity model has been applied to the spontaneous decay of an excited atom in a bulk medium @xcite and at the center of a homogeneous sphere @xcite .",
    "the local - field corrected decay rate for the latter case was found to be the uncorrected rate multiplied by a global factor and shifted by a constant term .",
    "it was suggested that the result , reformulated in terms of the associated green tensor , remains valid for arbitrary geometries .",
    "this was proven correct in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it it is shown that the local - field corrected green tensor can under very general assumptions be decomposed into the sum of the uncorrected green tensor modified by a factor and a translationally invariant term .",
    "such a decomposition of the green tensor is not only appropriate to obtain the abovementioned results for the rate of spontaneous decay .",
    "it can also be used to calculate local - field corrected vdw potentials .",
    "a first hint was given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the local - field corrected vdw interaction of two ground - state atoms placed in adjacent semi - infinite magnetoelectric media is studied .",
    "van der waals interactions play an important role in various fields , where often the interacting objects are embedded in media so that local - field effects may be expected to play a major role .",
    "for example , in colloid science the mutual vdw attractions of colloidal particles suspended in a liquid influence the stability of such suspensions @xcite .",
    "in particular , clustering of particles ( flocculation ) may occur unless the suspension is sufficiently balanced by electrostatic repulsive forces @xcite .",
    "examples of vdw interactions of microobjects embedded in media can also be found in biology @xcite , such as cell  cell , cell  substratum , cell  virus , and cell  vesicle interactions @xcite , where the investigations are usually based on the works of lifshitz @xcite and hamaker @xcite .",
    "so , it has been studied whether the theory of vdw interactions can explain the phenomenon of biomolecular organization @xcite .",
    "in particular , electrostatic and vdw forces between a protein crystal and a molecule in solution have been ( theoretically ) compared @xcite , and the non - additivity of vdw interactions between two layers within a multilayer assembly such as lipid ",
    "water has been investigated @xcite .",
    "needless to say that vdw interactions represent only one effect among others and that the systems are usually very complex , involving a broad range of issues such as surface charges , simultaneous existence of many different molecules , flexibility of biological macromolecules , fluidity of membranes , and various types of non - covalent forces , e.g. , vdw , electrostatic , solvation , steric , entropic , and structural ones @xcite .    in the present paper , single- and many - atom",

    "in this paper , we have studied the local - field corrected vdw interaction of ground - state atoms embedded in a finite magnetoelectric medium of arbitrary size and shape .",

    "the frequency - dependent contributions to the two - atom potential , on the other hand , are enhanced by a factor between @xmath174 and @xmath184 owing to the local - field correction .",
