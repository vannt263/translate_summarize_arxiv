    "recently , baados , silk and west ( bsw ) @xcite showed that spinning black holes can play the role of particle accelerators . compared with terrestrial accelerators",
    ", they have a fascinating and important property that two particles ( for example , the dark matter particles ) falling freely from rest at infinity can collide with arbitrarily high center - of - mass ( cm ) energy at the horizon of an extremal kerr black hole , which could provide a visible probe of planck - scale physics .",
    "however , fine - tunings arise , namely , the black hole must be a maximally spinning one and one of the particles should have orbital angular momentum per unit rest mass @xmath4 corresponding to marginally bound geodesics .",
    "subsequently , in @xcite and @xcite , the authors further elucidated the mechanism for the results of bsw .",
    "they pointed out that there must exist a practical limitation on the achievable cm energy from the astrophysical limitations , i.e. , the maximal spin , back - reaction effects or gravitational radiation .",
    "for example , the spin @xmath0 of astrophysical black holes should not exceed @xmath5 ( @xmath3 is the mass of an astrophysical black hole ) according to the work of thorne @xcite . denoting the deviation of the spin from its maximal value as @xmath6 , jacobson and sotiriou got the maximal cm energy @xcite @xmath7 where , @xmath8 is the rest mass of the colliding particles .",
    "taking @xmath5 as a limit , one will obtain the maximal cm energy per unit rest mass 19.20 , which is a finite value .",
    "lake also showed that the cm energy of collision at the inner horizon of a nonextremal kerr black hole is limited @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , scattering of particles in gravitational field and extraction of energy from a rotating black hole was investigated .",
    "it is known that , the motion of a particle traveling in the background of a charged spinning black hole depends not only on the spin but also on the charge of the black hole .",
    "therefore , the cm energy of collision will also depend both on the spin and charge .",
    "note that there is no work focusing on the cm energy for the collision in the background of a charged spinning black hole .",
    "so , it is worthwhile to study the detailed behavior of the cm energy for the collision in the background of a charged spinning black hole . for the purpose",
    ", we will study the cm energy in the background of a kerr - newman ( kn ) black hole .",
    "besides the spin @xmath0 , the black hole has another parameter , the charge @xmath1 , which should affect the cm energy . on the other hand",
    ", it is generally thought that the black holes are surrounded by relic cold dark matter density spikes and there exists no electromagnetic interactions between the cold dark matter and other matters .",
    "so , it provides a strong motivation for us to consider the collision of two uncharged particles in the background of a kn black hole . with the motivation ,",
    "we find the cm energy can still be unlimited for a pair of uncharged particles falling freely from rest at infinity and colliding at the horizon of an extremal black hole with some fine - tunings . for the near - extremal black hole",
    ", we also give a numerical exploration on the cm energy .",
    "the result implies that there always exists a finite upper bound for the cm energy , which decreases with the increase of the charge @xmath1 . in this paper",
    ", we neglect the effects of gravitational waves and the back - reaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ cmenergy1 ] , we will give a detailed study on the equations of motion for particles . in sec .",
    "[ cmenergy2 ] , employing the equations of motion for particles , we will obtain the cm energy for two colliding particles falling freely from rest at infinity in the background of a kn black hole .",
    "the results show that the cm energy at the horizon can be unlimited if one of the colliding particles has the critical angular momentum and the spin @xmath0 of the black hole satisfies @xmath2 .",
    "it is also shown that , for a near - extremal black hole there always exists a finite upper bound of cm energy and the bound decreases with the increase of the charge @xmath1 .",
    "the final section is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "we use the units @xmath9 in this paper .",
    "in this section , we would like to study the equations of motion for a particle in the background of a kn black hole .",
    "first , let us give a brief review of the black hole background we dealt with .",
    "the kn black hole is described by the metric with the boyer - lindquist coordinates ( where we have set the mass @xmath3 of the black hole to 1 ) @xmath10^{2}\\nonumber\\\\      & & -\\frac{\\delta}{\\rho^{2}}\\big[dt - a \\sin^{2}\\theta d\\phi\\big]^{2 } ,    \\label{knblackhole}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 @xmath1 is the charge of the black hole , and @xmath0 is its angular momentum per unit rest mass and @xmath12 . in the case",
    "@xmath13 , the metric ( [ knblackhole ] ) describes a kerr black hole . and",
    "in the case @xmath14 , it describes a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the 4-dimensional electromagnetic potential reads @xmath15.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the horizons for the kn black hole are given by @xmath16 here , the positive sign denotes the outer horizon and the negative one denotes the inner one .",
    "the existence of the horizons requires @xmath17 where `` = '' corresponds to the extremal black hole with one degenerate horizon .",
    "next , we would like to study the equations of motion for a test particle with mass @xmath18 and charge @xmath19 in the background of a kn black hole .",
    "the motion of a particle is described by the lagrangian @xmath20 where a dot over a symbol denotes ordinary differentiation with respect to an affine parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the affine parameter @xmath21 is related to the proper time by @xmath22 , which is equivalent to the normalizing condition @xmath23 for an uncharged particle , @xmath24 are corresponded to timelike , null or spacelike geodesics , respectively . for a massive particle , we have @xmath25 .",
    "the momenta is @xmath26 thus the hamiltonian is given by @xmath27 with the help of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the hamilton - jacobi equation can be expressed as @xmath28 with @xmath29 the jacobi action . to solve the hamilton - jacobi equation ,",
    "we separate the jacobi action as @xmath30 where the parameter @xmath31 is the energy of the charged particle , and @xmath32 is the angular momentum per unit rest mass of the particle in the @xmath33 direction as measured by an observer at rest at infinity . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are , respectively , functions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 . inserting ( [ action ] ) in ( [ hjeq ] ) , we obtain @xmath38 from the above form , we can see that the left - hand side is only the function of @xmath37 and the right - hand side is only the function of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , both sides must be equal to a constant denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "so , we have @xmath40 using the relations @xmath41 , @xmath42 and the eq .",
    "( [ momenta ] ) , we have @xcite @xmath43 with @xmath44 the sign functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are independent from each other . using the relations @xmath47 , @xmath48 and eq .",
    "( [ momenta ] ) , we get @xmath49 solving these equations , we get @xcite @xmath50 here , we have obtain equations of motion for a particle . on the equatorial plane @xmath51 ,",
    "the equations are reduced to @xmath52   & \\frac{dt}{d\\tau}=\\frac{-a(a e - l)\\delta+(r^{2}+a^{2})p}{r^{2}\\delta},\\label{4s}\\\\   & \\frac{dr}{d\\tau}=-\\frac{\\sqrt{r}}{r^{2}},\\\\   & \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\tau}=0,\\\\   & \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\tau}=\\frac{(l - ae)\\delta+ap}{r^{2}\\delta } ,      \\end{aligned }    \\right.\\ ] ] where we take @xmath53 .",
    "note that the motion of a particle on the equatorial plane in the kn metric is completely determined by eq .",
    "( [ 4s ] ) .",
    "in this section , we will study the cm energy of the collision for two particles moving on the equatorial plane of a kn black hole .",
    "let us now consider that two charged particles with the same rest mass @xmath54 are at rest at infinity ( @xmath55 ) , then they approach the black hole and collide at some radius @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the two particles have angular momenta and charges ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) and ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , respectively .",
    "taking into account that the background is curved , the energy in the center - of - mass frame for this collision should be computed with @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the 4-velocities of the two particles , which can be straightforwardly calculated from ( [ 4s ] ) and are @xmath63 here , we take @xmath64 for simplicity . with the help of ( [ energy ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the cm energy for the collision : @xmath65 with @xmath66 given by @xmath67 \\nonumber\\\\      & & -r^{2}(2a^{2}+q^{2}-l_{1}l_{2}+q^{2}q_{1}q_{2})-2a^{2}r\\nonumber\\\\   & & + 2r\\big[a(l_{1}+l_{2})-l_{1}l_{2}\\big ] + q^{2}(a - l_{1})(a - l_{2})\\nonumber\\\\   & &     + aqr\\big[a(q_{1}+q_{2})-(l_{2}q_{1}+l_{1}q_{2})\\big]\\nonumber\\\\     & & + \\sqrt{(a^{2}+r^{2}-al_{1}-qrq_{1})^{2}-\\delta(r^{2}+(a - l_{1})^{2})}\\nonumber\\\\     & &   \\times \\sqrt{(a^{2}+r^{2}-al_{2}-qrq_{2})^{2}-\\delta(r^{2}+(a - l_{2})^{2})}.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that ( [ knenergy ] ) is invariant under the interchange @xmath68 and @xmath69 . on the other hand , in the case @xmath70 ,",
    "the cm energy ( [ knenergy ] ) for two charged particles in the background of a kn black hole will reduce to the one for two uncharged particles in the background of a kerr black hole given in @xcite , as it is expected .",
    "in fact , we need only the condition @xmath13 to obtain the cm energy in the background of a kerr black hole , which indicates that the charge of the collision particles has no influence on the cm energy in the background of an uncharged black hole .",
    "we keep in mind that black holes are surrounded by relic cold dark matter density spikes .",
    "the cm energy of massive cold dark matter particles colliding near the black hole may reach a high cm energy , which could provide a probe to the high energy physics .",
    "it is also thought that the cold dark matter has no electromagnetic interactions with other matters .",
    "so , we consider that two uncharged cold dark matter particles collide in the background of a kn black hole .",
    "thus , we take @xmath71",
    ". then the cm energy can be read from ( [ knenergy ] ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is @xmath74+q^{2}(a - l_{2})(a - l_{2 } ) \\nonumber\\\\     & & + \\sqrt{(a^{2}+r^{2}-al_{1})^{2}-\\delta[r^{2}+(a - l_{1})^{2}]}\\nonumber\\\\     & &         \\times \\sqrt{(a^{2}+r^{2}-al_{2})^{2}-\\delta[r^{2}+(a - l_{2})^{2}]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , the result confirms that the charge @xmath1 of the black hole indeed has influence on the cm energy .",
    "next , it is worthwhile to study the properties of ( [ kn2blackhole ] ) as the radius @xmath36 approaches to the horizon @xmath75 of an extremal black hole .",
    "since the black hole considered here is an extremal one , we have @xmath76 .",
    "note that the horizon is always at @xmath77 for any spin @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that the denominator of @xmath78 in ( [ kn2blackhole ] ) vanishes at @xmath79 .",
    "then it is naive to obtain the result that @xmath78 diverges at the horizon .",
    "in fact , the numerator also vanishes at that point .",
    "the limiting value of @xmath78 at @xmath80 can be calculated as follows : @xmath81 clearly , the value of @xmath78 is indeed finite for generic values of @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "however , when @xmath56 or @xmath58 takes the critical angular momentum @xmath82 the cm energy @xmath78 will be unlimited , which means that the particles can collide with arbitrarily high cm energy at the horizon .",
    "thus , the result may provide an effective way to probe the planck - scale physics in the background of an extremal kn black hole .",
    "compared with the result for the kerr black hole @xcite , the spin @xmath0 of the black hole here can deviate from its maximal value to obtain an arbitrarily high cm energy . however , we need to make sure that the particle with critical angular momentum @xmath83 can reach the horizon .",
    "as we mentioned before , to obtain an arbitrarily high cm energy , one of the colliding particles should have critical angular momentum @xmath83 . here",
    "we first examine the critical angular momentum ( [ lc ] ) . when the spin @xmath84 , we get @xmath85 , which is just the critical angular momentum in the case of an extremal kerr black hole @xcite . however , for the case @xmath86 , @xmath83 is divergent and the cm energy is @xmath87 which implies that , in order to get a very high cm energy , one of the colliding particles should have very large angular momentum .",
    "however , a particle with very large angular momentum can not reach the horizon if it falls freely from rest at infinity .",
    "so there must exist a range for the spin @xmath0 to ensure that the particle with critical angular momentum @xmath83 reaches the horizon of the black hole .",
    "next , we will determine the range of the spin @xmath0 by the effective potential method .",
    "the effective potential for a particle with critical angular momentum @xmath83 on the equatorial plane of an extremal black hole is @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "as expected , the effective potential @xmath90 approaches 0 at infinity .",
    "here , we can get a condition for the particle falling freely from rest at infinity to reach the horizon : @xmath91 which is equivalent to @xmath92 solving eq .",
    "( [ rc ] ) , we get the range for the spin @xmath0 of the black holes : @xmath93 which means that for an extremal black hole with the spin @xmath94 , the particle with critical angular momentum @xmath83 can reach the horizon of the black hole .",
    "we can also determine the range of the angular momentum for a fixed spin @xmath0 with the same method .",
    "however , it can not be written in a closed form for an arbitrary spin @xmath0 . here",
    ", we give some results : the range of the angular momentum is @xmath95 for @xmath96 , @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "so , for a fixed spin @xmath94 , if @xmath101 and @xmath58 is in a proper range , the cm energy will be unlimited .",
    "we plot the effective potential @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ veff ] for the spin @xmath102 and 0.9 , respectively .",
    "clearly , for @xmath96 , the effective potential @xmath90 is positive near the horizon @xmath77 , so the particle can not reach the horizon in this case . for @xmath98 and 0.9 , the effect potential",
    "@xmath90 is negative when @xmath103 .",
    "so , the particle can reach the horizon in both cases .",
    "we also plot the cm energy @xmath78 of collision in fig .",
    "[ ecm ] for @xmath101 and @xmath104 . for the case",
    "@xmath105 , the cm energy only exists for @xmath106 .",
    "this is because the collision for the two colliding particles with angular momenta @xmath101 and @xmath104 can not take place at @xmath107 . for the spin @xmath98 and 0.9",
    ", the cm energy is divergent at the horizon @xmath77 .    as noted above",
    ", we show that an arbitrarily high cm energy can be obtained when the collision takes place at the horizon of an extremal kn black hole with @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this scenario is an idealized one , because the proper time for a particle with the critical angular momentum @xmath83 to approach the horizon of an extremal black hole from infinity is infinite .",
    "thus this collision process does not take place in the real world .",
    "however , for the case of a near - extremal black hole , the proper time for the particle to reach the horizon is a finite value even though it is very large .",
    "so , it seems worthwhile to consider a near - extremal black hole .",
    "the cm energy at the outer horizon @xmath110 for a near - extremal black hole is found to be @xmath111 where @xmath112 the form is the same as ( [ lkn ] ) with the replacement @xmath113 . here",
    ", we denote the small parameter @xmath114 with @xmath115 . for fixed charge @xmath1 and @xmath116 , the range @xmath117 of angular momentum for the particles to reach the horizon",
    "can be determined numerically with the effective potential @xmath90 for a near - extremal black hole . for a angular momentum @xmath118",
    ", we can get a negative @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "however , for arbitrary charge @xmath1 and @xmath116 , we find that , within a small range near the horizon @xmath110 , the effective potential @xmath121 is always positive , which means the angular momentum @xmath122 does not lie in the range @xmath117 .",
    "so the cm energy @xmath78 in ( [ outcm ] ) is not divergent .",
    "thus the cm energy is finite for arbitrary charge @xmath1 and spin @xmath0 . considering that one of the colliding particles has the maximum angular momentum @xmath123 and another one has the minimum angular momentum @xmath124 , we obtain the cm energy per unit rest mass for different @xmath1 and @xmath116 .",
    "the result is shown in table [ tablecmenergy ] . from it",
    ", we can see that , for a kn black hole with spin @xmath0 less than @xmath125 there will be an upper bound for the cm energy .",
    "it is also suggested that the cm energy grows very slowly as the maximally spinning case ( @xmath126 ) is approached . for fixed parameter @xmath116 ,",
    "the value of cm energy decreases with the increase of the charge @xmath1 . for the case @xmath13",
    ", it describes a kerr black hole and the result shown in table [ tablecmenergy ] is exactly consistent with @xcite .",

    "first , we consider the case that the black hole is still an extremal one , but there exists a small tolerance @xmath132 on the critical angular momentum @xmath83 . for simplicity , we choose @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the rest mass for the colliding particle is considered to @xmath135 gev , just like the mass of a neutron .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the collision of two uncharged particles ( which could be thought to be the cold dark matter particles ) falling freely from rest at infinity in the background of a kn black hole .",

    "compared with the kerr black hole , to obtain an arbitrarily high cm energy , besides the conditions that the black hole is an extremal black hole and one of the colliding particles has critical angular momentum , there still exists a restriction on the value of the spin @xmath0 of the kn black hole , which is a significant difference between the two black holes . for a near - extremal black hole",
