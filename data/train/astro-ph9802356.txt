    "both theoretical and observational investigations into the origins of type ia supernovae ( ) have focused on binary star evolution . within this framework ,",
    "scenarios are divided into `` single degenerate '' ( @xcite ) and `` double degenerate '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) models . in the former models , a white dwarf ( wd ) accretes from a nondegenerate companion , while in the latter , two wds with a total mass exceeding the chandrasekhar limit ( ) are assumed to coalesce .",
    "the latter scenario predicts that there should exist a population of close , short - period ( @xmath0  10@xmath1 ) binary wd systems , or double degenerates ( dds ) , with total system masses in excess of .",
    "the binary components are initially brought to short - period orbits by common envelope ( ce ) evolution , with the energy necessary to expel the envelope taken from orbital shrinkage ( @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , further loss of orbital angular momentum through emission of gravitational wave radiation provides the mechanism through which the merger can take place .",
    "it is important to note that at present it is not entirely clear if the coalescence of two wds with a total mass exceeding really produces a  or rather an accretion induced collapse ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the existence of dd systems is a definite prediction of the theory of close binary star evolution .",
    "recently , several authors have made the suggestion that the properties of observed  are not consistent with the detonation of progenitors having a single , well - defined mass .",
    "these include an apparently real dispersion in the peak  absolute b magnitudes and a correlation between the peak magnitude and the decay rate of the b light curve ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite report matching the relationship only by requiring a variation in the amount of carbon burned to ni@xmath2 of nearly a factor of two .",
    "it has been suggested that accumulation of he atop an ordinary sub-  co wd , or the merger of sub-  he+co wds might provide the necessary range of masses and produce edge - lit detonations ( elds ) with characteristics ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the viability of this mechanism is controversial ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and existing estimates of the expected rate of elds in sub-  systems fall short of the inferred galactic  rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "another alternative is that some of these systems may evolve into ultra - short period interacting am cvn systems , which are believed by many authors to consist of lower - mass co white dwarfs accreting from very low - mass he wd secondaries ( e.g. , liebert et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "@xcite discovered the prototype dd , l  8702 ( eg 11 ) , which has an orbital period @xmath3 .",
    "however , the period is too long for the system to merge on an astrophysically interesting time scale . when the merger does take place , a  probably will not result since the total system mass is below  ( @xcite ) . in recent years",
    ", three systematic searches for dds have been performed .",
    "two of these ( @xcite , hereafter rs ; @xcite , hereafter fwg ) failed to discover any candidates at all .",
    "the third ( @xcite , hereafter bgrd ) did discover one dd ( and 4 other candidates ) , but the low primary mass ( @xmath4 0.37  ; @xcite ) of the confirmed dd renders it an unlikely  progenitor .",
    "we note that bgrd found a period @xmath0  118 for their confirmed dd ( 0957@xmath5666 ) , however , recent observations ( moran , marsh , & bragaglia 1997 ) reveal that the system actually has a period @xmath0 88 minutes and primary and secondary masses of 0.37 and 0.32 , respectively .",
    "recently , observations targeting the low - mass tail of the wd mass distribution of bergeron , saffer , & liebert ( 1992 ) spectacularly confirmed the prediction that wds with masses less than the canonical core - helium ignition mass are likely to be post - common envelope objects residing in short - period binary systems ( marsh , dhillon , & duck 1995 ; marsh 1995 ) .",
    "however , the low wd masses again make them unlikely  progenitors .",
    "these negative results have cast some doubt on the merging dd scenario as the favored mechanism for producing .",
    "there does exist one example of a dd system where the combined mass is believed to exceed the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "@xcite discovered that lb  11146 consists of a normal da wd and a highly magnetic daxp wd .",
    "the combined mass of the system is between 1.71.9 , but the orbital period is unknown .",
    "@xcite failed to detect radial velocity variations in the core of  to a limit 20  with periods 1 hour , and a recent _ hubble space telescope _",
    "imaging program ( @xcite ) did not resolve the components to a separation @xmath6 0025 , corresponding to @xmath6 1 a.u .",
    "on the plane of the sky .",
    "if the progenitor stars were massive , as seems likely given the large masses of the remnants , close binary interaction is likely to have occurred in a previous agb phase .",
    "further work to establish the orbital period of this remarkable binary is urgently needed .",
    "another possible outcome of close binary evolution is a merger during the late stages of a ce phase leading to the formation of a single , possibly massive white dwarf ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "large numbers of hot white dwarfs were detected in the rosat and euve surveys , and analyses of optical follow - up observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) determined stellar parameters , including masses . comparing",
    "the rosat and euve samples with the cooler , optically selected sample of @xcite revealed a statistically significant excess of hot , supermassive wds , which may represent a population of coalesced binary wds .",
    "the high - mass excess may partly arise from differences in the cooling rates of normal ( 0.6 ) and massive ( @xmath7 1.0 ) stars , but there may still be too many massive white dwarfs to be explained by the predictions of single star evolution , with a conventional initial mass  final mass relation , initial mass function , and star formation history .",
    "recent theoretical work ( @xcite , hereafter ylts ; @xcite , hereafter ity ) reveals that consideration of the `` visibility function '' , a consequence of wd cooling along evolutionary sequences , is an important factor in calculations of the expected dd number distribution .",
    "systems born with orbital periods @xmath0  10@xmath1 do not evolve to shorter periods by emission of gravitational radiation on interesting ( i.e. , short ) timescales .",
    "below 10@xmath1 , an approximate equilibrium is established between systems born into short - period orbits and those that vanish either by merging or by cooling in some @xmath8 years beyond the detection limits of surveys with relatively bright limiting magnitudes , such as our own .",
    "only a small fraction of these pairs will actually merge in the @xmath8 year period of visibility , and only 1/20 of the pairs with @xmath9  are visible ( cf .",
    "ity , figure 2 ) .",
    "these results indicate that previous dd searches had sample sizes too small to reveal the massive , short - period systems of interest . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that the close dds that _ were _ discovered ( saffer et al .",
    "1988 ; bgrd ; @xcite ; @xcite ) fall within the peak of the expected dd number distribution ( cf .",
    "ylts , ity ) .",
    "ylts suggested that further searches with increased sample sizes are likely to reveal the existence of the short - period , massive dd population . in this paper , we report observations of an enlarged sample in order to place meaningful constraints both on dds as progenitors and , more generally , on the theory of close binary star evolution .",
    "our sample comprises 107 apparently single da ( hydrogen line ) and db ( helium line ) wds with @xmath10 drawn from the catalog of @xcite , which are largely not in common with the previous three systematic surveys . over two observing seasons , in a total of 21 nights in 4 observing runs from 19941996 , we have obtained radial velocity spectroscopy at the kitt peak national observatory s 2.1-m reflector equipped with goldcam .",
    "this instrumentation provided 3fwhm spectral resolution over a spectral range of 700centered on  and including he i @xmath11 .",
    "exposure times were chosen to achieve a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of 30 per pixel .",
    "we have augmented the wd sample with a sample of 46 apparently single subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars previously observed by saffer ( 1991 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the radial velocity observations were obtained using the steward observatory s kitt peak station 2.3-m reflector , equipped with instrumentation similar to that used at the kitt peak 2.1-m and providing nearly identical spectral coverage and resolution .",
    "the inclusion of the sdb stars in the sample is appropriate since these core helium - burning stars are believed to evolve directly to the wd cooling sequence on a relatively short time scale following core helium exhaustion .",
    "theoretical calculations which predict the period and mass distributions of dds do take into account the contribution from the descendents of he stars .",
    "our choices of spectral features , resolution , and s / n ratio for our observations convey several advantages : 1 ) in all but the hottest da wds , and in all sdb stars ,  has a sharp ( fwhm 1 ) non - lte core , making it possible at our resolution and s / n ratio to measure radial velocities with 2030  errors despite the extreme width of the stark - broadened absorption line .",
    "the he i @xmath11 line in db wds provides similar precision , 3040 .",
    "the close , short - period dds of interest have peak - to - peak radial velocity amplitudes nearly an order of magnitude larger than these detection limits , and any existing systems would have a significant probability of detection ( for our sample , 70% in the period range 2@xmath1220@xmath13 ; see  7 for details ) .",
    "2 ) our method detects objects with similar temperatures , like the prototype l  8702 , by revealing variations of both absorption cores in a double - lined spectrum .",
    "the technique of differential photometry in the wings of the absorption line does not detect this type of system .",
    "3 ) spectroscopic observations in the core of  offer the maximum velocity resolution for any wd spectral features observable from the ground at intermediate resolution .",
    "4 ) the large throughput at intermediate spectral resolution makes it possible to observe large , relatively faint samples with modest telescope apertures .",
    "our targets were observed twice on any given night separated by 12 hr , followed by a third observation a day or two later .",
    "radial velocity variations of short - period systems are easily detected simply by comparing spectra by eye , although in follow - up observations to determine the orbital parameters , velocities will be measured formally by line profile fitting . in particular , derived periods and velocity semi - amplitudes will determine mass functions and provide lower bounds on total system masses .    in table",

    "the last two panels at the bottom right in figure [ multistack ] show the detection of narrow , variable emission in the cores of the wd absorption lines , betraying otherwise hidden low - mass main sequence ( ms ) companions in detached , pre - cataclysmic binary ( pcb ) systems . the  emission likely results from reprocessing of uv photons from the hotter wd in the cooler stars atmospheres ( cf .",

    "random inclination of the orbital planes to the line of sight masks radial velocity variations for near plane - on systems .",
    "2 .   our temporal sampling imposes two different constraints : @xmath26 ) exposure times for most objects were between 15 and 30 minutes , which would cause smearing of the observed line profiles for orbital periods shorter than 12 hours .",
    "this affects all objects in the same way .",

    "the orbital velocity of the primary will be lower than for high - mass secondaries .",
    "wd+ms pairs are especially afflicted with this bias since the ms companion typically must have a mass @xmath6 0.3  in order to have remained hidden until detected spectroscopically .",
    "however , this bias is mitigated by the frequent presence of reprocessed  emission in the ms secondary s photosphere , which is easily detected .",
    "4 .   given our modest radial velocity precision ( 2030  at our intermediate spectral resolution and s / n ratio ) , very long period systems will have velocities too small to detect variations .",
    "5 .   in very hot and/or strongly magnetic da and dao wds , the line profiles are usually shallow and very broad , and they lack the sharp , non - lte absorption core of line profiles of cooler or non - magnetic wds .",
    "velocity differences are therefore very difficult to discern , except for the very hottest da or dao wds , like feige 55 , which often show narrow photospheric emission in the  absorption line ( cf .",

    "previous investigators ( rs , fwg , @xcite , @xcite ) have used a number of analytical methods for estimating detection probabilities .",
    "each approach attempted to address a particular statistical question .",
    "for example , fwg calculated the probability that no binaries at all were found in their sample , while marsh et al .",
    "( 1995 ) calculated the ratio of the probabilities that individual objects were binaries vs. single stars .",
    "our own concern is to estimate the fraction of bonafide dd systems our survey fails to detect due to selection effects .",
    "we choose a monte carlo approach , beginning with our calculated mass / period distribution ( figure [ bivary ] ) .    for each object in table",
    "[ wdsample ] , we first randomly select an orbital period and primary mass from the theoretical distribution using the rejection method ( @xcite ) .",
    "we deem the experiment to have failed and continue with the next object if the orbital period is less than 2 hours .",
    "we then randomly select a secondary mass , using the same procedure , from one of the two distributions for wd+wd given in the top panel of figure 4 of ity , according to whether the primary is a he or co wd .",
    "the orbital separation and primary wd velocity are computed , an orbital plane inclination is chosen from the probability distribution @xmath28 , and an initial orbital phase is chosen from a uniform deviate .",
    "orbital phase zero is defined as the positive - going crossing of the systemic velocity by the primary s velocity curve .    with all relevant orbital parameters fixed ,",
    "radial velocities are then computed for each mid - exposure time of observation , and the maximum radial velocity difference is determined .",
    "we consider the simulated system to have been detected if the maximum velocity difference exceeds 65 , or 2.5 times an assumed 1@xmath17 precision of 25  ( consistent with our definition of definite detection when the observed line core variation exceeds 1.5 ) .",
    "a `` hit '' is recorded for each detected object , and the next object is then tested .",
    "the experiment was repeated for all wds in table [ wdsample ] , and for each complete pass through the sample the detection probability was taken to be the fraction of hits .",
    "this is specific to our sample , as it depends on the sequence of observation times for each object , and it assumes a parent population of 100% wd+wd binaries with the theoretical log @xmath0log @xmath4 distribution of figure [ bivary ] .",
    "the procedure was repeated 1000 times each for two cases of orbital plane inclination : @xmath29 ( edge - on ) and @xmath28 , and for three cases of allowed periods : all periods in our calculated grid , @xmath0 between 2@xmath120@xmath13 , and @xmath0 between 2@xmath1210@xmath13 .",
    "the result for the most favorable condition , with @xmath29 and @xmath0 between 2@xmath110@xmath13 , is shown in figure [ ddprob ] , where the distribution of detection efficiencies is nearly gaussian with a mean of 83% and standard deviation of 3% .",
    "the remaining results are given in table [ allddprob ] , which shows that the effects of random inclination of orbital planes and low velocities associated with longer orbital periods are both important contributors to decreased detection efficiency .",
    "we adopt an upper limit of 1020 days to our sensitivity bandpass ( with a lower limit of 2 hours ) , corresponding to a detection efficiency of 70% over our entire sample .",
    "we do not consider the probability of duplicity for individual objects , as theoretical predictions of the fraction of dds and the mass and period distributions pertain to the entire population of wds and sdbs in the galaxy .",
    "our method of estimating detection efficiencies allows an evaluation of selection effects on the raw observed fraction of dds detected in the sample as a whole .",
    "comparison of the existing observations with the bivariate distribution of figure [ bivary ] is not straightforward for two reasons : 1 ) the number of dd systems discovered to date which have orbital periods and primary ( visible ) masses determined is still quite small .",
    "2 ) the measurement errors for the wd and sdb masses , based primarily on surface gravity errors , are generally 0.050.10 in  and do not permit an unambiguous comparision . of the six systems near  = 0.3 and lying just below the co peak at 0.2 ( 0.6 ) in figure [ bivary ] , five have sdb primaries with masses near 0.5 . as such",
    ", they sensibly ought to lie slightly below the co peak , and we do not consider this a serious disagreement .",
    "the sdb periods do agree very well with the predicted co wd period distribution .",
    "four objects lie comfortably near either the dd birthline or the two peaks at  = 0.5 and 0.65 .",
    "the remaining objects do not appear to lie near peaks in the distribution .",
    "the agreement with theory would be improved if the derived wd primary masses were systematically too large , or if the theoretically predicted masses were systematically too small .",
    "we note that the effect of varying the common envelope efficiency parameter  ( which was taken to be unity in our calculations ) is largely to shift the predicted periods , not the primary masses ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that at least some observed dd primary masses are overestimated due to the presence of a fainter and usually more massive wd companion .",
    "line profile analysis of the composite optical spectrum of the brighter , lower - gravity visible wd and a dimmer , but higher - gravity wd might result in a derived surface gravity higher than that of the primary alone and would imply a too - large primary mass .",
    "on the other hand , in cases where the mass ratios have been measured ( l  8702 , 1101 + 364 , 0957666 ) , the wds have similar masses , and it is unlikely that companions contribute more than 20% of the light in 1241010 , 1317 + 453 and 1713 + 332 ( t. marsh , private communication ) .",
    "also , the radial velocity data for 0957666 almost certainly preclude reducing the wd masses .    there may be another effect which distorts the bivariate number distribution in the @xmath30@xmath31  diagram .",
    "the theoretical grid was constructed assuming that all wds follow the same cooling sequence computed by @xcite for 0.6 @xmath32  wds .",
    "following their calculations , we assumed that all wds are detectable for a time @xmath33   in other words , we assumed that the luminosity of the white dwarf decreases below a certain detection limit in @xmath34yr , irrespective of its mass .",
    "until very recently , cooling sequences for low mass wds were not available .",
    "however , recent calculations ( @xcite ) for @xmath4 = 0.150.45  show that the more massive wds ( 0.45 ) cool to the same luminosity several times slower than the lower - mass ones ( 0.15 ) . this may be understood as an effect of the larger surface areas of low - mass wds .",
    "an attempt to quantify the effect of this mass dependence of cooling curves on the number distributions of wds is currently underway ( tutukov & yungelson , in preparation ) . the difference in cooling curves may shift the theoretical distribution in figure 3 more in favor of high - mass systems , and the strong concentration of wds along the `` birthline '' below  = 0.6 may diminish .    in light of the difficulty still associated with interpreting the theoretical bivariate distribution , the total predicted number of dd systems and the projected log @xmath0 and log @xmath4 distributions remain at present the best means of comparing the theory and observations . in table",
    "[ ddtheory ] , we present the predicted fractions of dd and wd+ms systems for three values of .",
    "successive columns give , the number of close dds vs. all wds ( i.e. , the sum of all single wds plus all wide and close pairs ) , the number of pre-  systems vs. all wds , and the number of close wd+ms pairs vs. all wds",
    ". the pre-  column describes dds which have a total system mass greater than  and may merge within a hubble time .",
    "the table also illustrates how many wds have to be surveyed for a detection of a pre- , and how much more effort has to be invested before observations will better constrain the theory .",
    "we now compare the predicted numbers of dds with two observed samples , the one reported here and that of bgrd , as these have similar magnitude limits and are sensitive to the same range of orbital periods ( 2 hr to a few days ) .",
    "three comparisons are possible :    1 .",
    "bgrd found 1 dd and 4 candidate dds in their sample of 54 wds ( 1/11 ) , and 4 wd+ms pairs , 2 which were unresolved , and 2 which were resolved as visual binaries ( 1/13 ) . in our combined sample of 107 wds and 46 sdbs",
    "we find 6 confirmed dds and 15 candidate dds , not all of which are new detections .",
    "we note that seven of these have sdb primaries , which have core helium - burning lifetimes of 12  @xmath24  10@xmath35 years , comparable to the interval during which wds are the brightest and are most likely to be discovered ( cf .",
    "however , the field sdb stars have a birthrate 0.5% of that of field wds ( @xcite ) , and they are thus quite heavily over - represented in our sample . considered separately , the fractions of dd systems with wd and sdb primaries among all stars in our sample are 1/8 and 1/7 , respectively . including the visual doubles and pg composites noted in tables [ wdsample ] and [ sdbsample ] ,",
    "12 wd+ms pairs are found in our sample ( 1/13 ) . excluding duplication of objects in common , the fractions of dds and wd+ms pairs found among all wds in our and bgrd s combined samples are 1/9 and 1/12 , respectively .",
    "these results are in good agreement with columns 2 and 4 of table [ ddtheory ] for values of  near 1.0 and tend to exclude much lower values of .",
    "the population synthesis code also predicts the expected projected period and mass distributions of close dds .",
    "we first compare the observations with the predicted period distribution in figure [ ddnlogp ] .",
    "the theoretical prediction is the solid histogram ( taken as a projection onto the log @xmath0 axis from our most recent calculation of the bivariate distribution ) , and the dot - dashed histogram is the observed period distribution of the dds in table [ knowndd ] , including the newly - discovered sdb+wd pairs .",
    "the observed distribution ( arbitrarily normalized ) is generally in agreement with the predicted distribution , albeit possibly offset to shorter periods .",
    "part of the apparent deficit of systems at longer periods is due to the decline in our detection efficiency at orbital periods longer than 1020 days .",
    "3 .   in figure",
    "[ ddnlogm ] , the predicted distribution of primary masses of close dds is given as the solid histogram .",
    "there is a broad peak near  0.5 , corresponding to he wd primaries , and a second strong , narrow peak at  0.2 , corresponding to co wd primaries , with a tail extending to masses in excess of 1.2 .",
    "the dot - dashed histogram is the observed mass distribution of the dds in table [ knowndd ] .",
    "the observed distribution is generally in agreement with the predictions of theory , except for the apparent excess of stars in the bin at  = 0.3 .",
    "all but one of these ( l  8702 ) are sdb stars , which as we have previously noted , are over - represented in our sample .",
    "+ the theory also predicts that some 18% of primary stars in dds have co cores .",
    "we therefore expect to find 2 co wds in the confirmed short - period dd sample ; instead , we find none .",
    "we note that of the radial velocity variables in table [ ddvariables ] , 10 are in common with the sample of @xcite , among which only three objects have derived masses @xmath36 0.5 : 1232 + 479 ( 0.53 , weight 1 ) , 1446 + 286 ( 0.82 , weight 2 ) , and 2117 + 539 ( 0.50 , weight 1 ) .",
    "four other objects are in common with the sample of bragaglia et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , but only one has a derived mass @xmath36 0.5 : 1422 + 095 ( 0.51 ; weight 1 ) .",
    "it is crucial to obtain accurate masses for the remaining objects in table [ ddvariables ] to identify any co primaries which may reside in potential pre-  systems .",
    "the possibility that the primary stars optical spectra may be diluted with that of dimmer , possibly higher - gravity companions must be taken into account .    when confirmed , the 18 new candidate dds ( including the sdb variables ) from our survey will increase the number of known short - period dds to 29 systems , approaching the number predicted to include a super - system with a period short enough to merge in a hubble time ( 1/40 for  = 1.0 ; see table [ ddtheory ] ) .",
    "clearly , in addition to the follow - up observations to determine orbital periods and masses of the dd candidates in the current sample , further survey work is required in order to expand the wd sample by approximately a factor of 2 ( for  of 1.0 ) .",
    "the previous discussions have not taken into account dd systems missed in our survey due to selection effects .",
    "we first consider the systems with wd primaries .",
    "assuming an efficiency of 70% , our raw number of 14 confirmed and candidate dd systems would imply the existence of some 20 bonafide dd systems with wd primaries in our sample of 107 wds , or a fraction just under 1/5 of all wds .",
    "the same result is obtained from the sample of dds with sdb primaries .",
    "table [ ddtheory ] shows that this substantially exceeds the predicted fraction for  1 .",
    "such a high implied fraction of close binaries among all wds suggests that , formally ,  @xmath7 12 .",
    "we note that the condition that  @xmath7 1 has been suggested as a requirment for an explanation of the correlation of orbital periods and eccentricities of high mass binary pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and millisecond binary pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , since detailed numerical models of the ce process , which involve energy sources other than gravitational ( e.g. , @xcite ) are not available , any treatment of the evolution of orbital separations inside the ce , which ultimately determines the predicted number distributions , is at best an approximate estimate .",
    "the dao wds are a small class of hot , hydrogen - rich stars that show weak , narrow @xmath37 absorption in addition to the broad balmer lines . @xcite analyzed 12 daos and found that half of them have such low surface gravities ( and by implication low masses ) , that unlike most wds they can not be products of post - agb evolution .",
    "@xcite suggested that the low - mass daos might be the product of post - extended horizontal branch ( post - ehb ) evolution .",
    "another alternative was raised by @xcite , who noted that the very low mass of the dao feige 55 ( @xmath22 0.4 ) might be related to its double degenerate nature .",
    "the ehb stars ( sdbs and the hottest bhb stars ) are thought to have core masses very near 0.5 , and post - ehb evolution alone is unlikely to have produced feige 55 s low core mass .",
    "in contrast , close binary evolution is predicted to produce a wealth of low - mass remnants , as observations confirm .",
    "feige 55 was detected as a radial velocity variable in iue observations , and its orbital parameters were subsequently determined from data including observations obtained during our 1995 march observing run ( holberg et al .",
    "we also observed two other dao wds , 1210 + 533 and 2342 + 806 .",
    "the former star has relatively weak  absorption and has neither a sharp non - lte absorption core nor a central reversal .",
    "it does not appear to be a velocity variable , but we can not rule it out conclusively . the latter star ( gd 561 )",
    "is a near - twin of feige 55 , with a somewhat hotter temperature and an even lower surface gravity and mass .",
    "our observations do show a distinct emission reversal like that of feige 55 , but the star is constant in velocity at a level 15  over a span of 6 nights .",
    "these results point out the need for further investigation into the possible connection between close binary evolution and the very low masses of approximately half of all doa wds .",
    "we have performed a radial velocity survey of a total of 153 field wds and sdbs , most of which were not previously known to be binary . in the combined sample",
    ", we have discovered 18 new dd candidates with wd or sdb primaries , and 1 new confirmed wd+ms pair . among the 7 sdb variables",

    "our conclusions are :    1 .",
    "the population of close , short - period dd systems predicted by the theory of close binary star evolution does in fact exist in significant numbers .",
    "the raw observed fractions of confirmed short - period dds and wd+ms pairs among all wds are in satisfactory agreement with the predictions of theory for values of the common envelope efficiency parameter  near 1.0 .",
    "however , applying a correction for selection effects implies an excess of existing dds over the predicted number . a resolution of this apparent discrepancy will have to await a more complete understanding of the ce process .",
    "2 .   the observed dd orbital period and primary mass distributions do fall very nearly in the peak of the predicted distributions for  = 1.0 , although possibly shifted slightly .",
    "we note that the discrepancy of the predicted and observed period distributions could be made to vanish by a small decrease in the value of , a free parameter in the theory ( `` the parameter of ignorance '' , i. iben ) .",
    "the discrepancy with the predicted mass distribution is less amenable to fine - tuning of the theory , and we suggest that some previous primary wd mass determinations may have been systematically biased to higher masses due to dilution of the optical spectra by the presence of unseen , higher - gravity companions",
    ". over - representation of sdb primaries in the combined sample is responsible for the apparent excess of stars with masses near 0.5 .",
    "a refined analysis of the effect of the mass - dependence of wd cooling sequences upon the @xmath30@xmath31 number distribution is also required .",
    "3 .   the low - mass systems observed by marsh et al . ( 1995 ) and marsh ( 1995 ) tend to have short orbital periods , in agreement with theoretical predictions",
    ". however , their total system masses likely are too small to make them viable  progenitors .",

    "the sample of confirmed short - period dds is still smaller than the number predicted to contain a massive , short - period system .",
