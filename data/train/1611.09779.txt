    "the ordinary random walk has been well studied , and it is a widely known theorem that the exit distribution of the ordinary random walk converges to harmonic measure .",
    "a proof of this theorem can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are some other interesting random walks , such as random walks that have some self - avoiding constraint .",
    "one such model is the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) such that the walk visits each site at most once , and all walks with the same length have the same probability @xcite .",
    "the scaling limit of the saw in a simply connected domain is conjectured to be schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) with parameter @xmath0=8/3 @xcite .",
    "this result has a good numerical support @xcite . in this paper , we study another type of random walk called smart kinetic walk ( skw ) , which never intersects itself and never steps into a site that would lead to its being trapped .",
    "it first appeared in the physics literature in mid 1980s under some different names . in @xcite ,",
    "kremer and lyklema called it the infinitely growing saw .",
    "their model is the model that we consider in the full plane .",
    "weinrib and trugman have independently introduced the model and called it the smart kinetic walk @xcite .",
    "the skw model can be defined in any lattice and any dimension .",
    "we are interested in the two - dimensional walk on the square lattice .",
    "let @xmath1 be a bounded domain with smooth boundary containing the origin . to generate a skw @xmath2 with each @xmath3 in @xmath1",
    ", we start the walk at the origin , i.e. , @xmath4 . in the first step ,",
    "the walk can choose uniformly from the nearest neighbors of the origin with equal probability .",
    "the walk stops as soon as it reaches the boundary of the domain @xmath1 . if a site has been visited before or is outside of the domain , we call it an occupied site .",
    "a trapping site is a site that would lead it to get trapped , i.e. , there is no path from the site to the boundary of the domain through unoccupied sites . if a site is neither an occupied site nor a trapping site , we call it as an allowable site .",
    "consider the allowable nearest neighbors of @xmath5 and assign them with equal probability .",
    "we pick one randomly and assign it to be @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ skw_def ] illustrates a skw starting at the origin @xmath7 and walking up to the site @xmath8 .",
    "the nearest neighbor @xmath9 is occupied .",
    "site @xmath10 is a trapping site since it has no allowable path to the boundary of the domain .",
    "the walker can choose @xmath11 or @xmath1 for the next step each with probability 1/2 .",
    "on the hexagonal lattice , the skw in a bounded domain is equivalent to a percolation interface @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that the exit distribution of the skw converges in distribution to harmonic measure on the hexagonal lattice @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the usual skw model has been modified by averaging over the orientation of the lattice with respect to the domain , and monte carlo simulations have been carried out for this modified model on three lattices : triangular , square and hexagonal . from these simulations , this result still holds .",
    "moreover , the simulations lead to a conjecture that the difference between harmonic measure and the exit distribution of the rotationally averaged skw model , to first order in the lattice spacing @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a constant that only depends on the lattice and the model , and the density function @xmath15 depends only on the domain .",
    "see @xcite for details .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the effect of the symmetry of the transition probability on each step of the skw on the square lattice and test if the exit distribution converges weakly to harmonic measure .",
    "we are also interested in the leading order term in the difference between the skw with symmetric transition probability exit distribution and harmonic measure , which we refer to as the first order correction . in our model",
    ", we also average over rotations of the orientation of the lattice with respect to the domain @xmath1 . comparing with some other models with fixed lattice orientation ,",
    "since the scaling limit is rotationally invariant , the exit distribution does not depend on the orientation of the lattice .",
    "however , there is no reason to expect that the first order correction is independent to the lattice orientation .",
    "therefore , we are not studying the first order correction with the fixed orientation of the lattice .",
    "instead , we are studying rotationally averaged skw model here .",
    "note that in the original skw model , the transition probability at each step of the walk is defined as @xmath16 = 1/(number of the allowable sites ) .",
    "the walker starts at the origin and chooses one of the sites from four of the nearest neighbors each with probability 1/4 .",
    "after that , at each step , the walker searches for allowable sites .",
    "figure [ transitionprob ] shows possible allowable sites in different situations .",
    "the dashed line in the figure indicates that the site is blocked and the grey line indicates the direction of the previous step . in the original skw model , if all three neighbors are allowable , then the transition probability is 1/3 .",
    "the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 are all equal to 1/3 in figure [ transitionprob ] ( a ) . if one of the sites ( left , right or front ) is blocked , which corresponds to ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) in the figure [ transitionprob ] respectively , then the transition probability is 1/2 .",
    "this says the variables in ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) are all equal to 1/2 .",
    "we give a name to each case in figure [ transitionprob ] : ( a ) as the nblock case , ( b ) as the left - blocked case , ( c ) as the right - blocked case and ( d ) as the front - blocked case .",
    "we have not bothered to draw the trivial case for which there is only one allowable site . in the original model ,",
    "the transition probability is symmetric and uniform . in this paper",
    ", we consider the transition probabilities that are not uniform any more .",
    "we say that the transition probability in the skw is symmetric if it satisfies the following three conditions :    * @xmath19 , * @xmath20 , which implies @xmath21 , * @xmath22 .    given a domain @xmath1 ,",
    "there are different ways to define the point where the walk first exits the domain since it may not be exactly on the boundary of the domain @xmath1 . in this paper",
    ", we use orthogonal projection to define the exiting point , i.e. , we take the first point of the walk that is outside the domain and then orthogonally project the point onto the boundary of the domain .",
    "we consider this projection point as the endpoint for the walk .",
    "we define the distribution of this point as discrete exit distribution of skw with symmetric transition probability , denote it by @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the harmonic measure for the domain @xmath1 .",
    "we expect that @xmath23 converges weakly to @xmath24 as the lattice spacing @xmath12 goes to zero .",
    "the difference between these two measures , to first order in the lattice spacing @xmath12 , is given by the same form as in the original skw model , @xmath25 .",
    "moreover the density function @xmath15 is the same as in the usual uniform skw model and the explicit computation of this function can be found in @xcite .    from our simulations ,",
    "the limiting exit distribution of the skw with the non - uniform but symmetric transition probability as the lattice spacing goes to zero is indeed the harmonic measure .",
    "we also find that the constant @xmath14 does not depend on the domain , but depends on the transition probability , and the density function @xmath15 only depends on the domain @xmath1 .",
    "the conjecture in @xcite also holds in this model .",
    "we restate the conjecture here .    for each simply connected domain @xmath1 containing the origin in the plane",
    ", there is a function @xmath26 on @xmath27 which only depends on @xmath1 , and for each skw with symmetric transition probability on the square lattice with lattice spacing @xmath12 , there is a constant @xmath14 which only depends on the transition probability , such that @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the lebesgue measure on the boundary with respect to arc length .",
    "we have generated the data using the same code used in @xcite .",
    "the way we tested the conjecture is to compute the empirical skw exit distribution and compare it with distribution of the harmonic measure in two particular domains on the unit lattice .",
    "one domain @xmath30 is the circle centered at @xmath31 with radius 1 .",
    "another domain @xmath32 is the horizontal strip of width 1 with the distance from the origin to the top boundary equal to 0.6 .",
    "we are interested in the limit where the lattice spacing goes to zero . for each domain and case with different transition probability",
    ", we ran simulations with @xmath33 .    in our simulations",
    ", we use cumulative distribution function to display the results .",
    "let @xmath34 represent the polar angle of the orthogonally projected endpoint for the skw and @xmath35 be the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the harmonic measure . to test the conjecture , we compared the difference of the empirical cumulative distribution function ( ecdf ) of the data , denoted as @xmath36 , with @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath37 samples are simulated .",
    "the first simulation we implemented is a test on the exit distribution of skw where the front probability @xmath38 in the nblock case ( a ) has changed and @xmath39 is equal to @xmath18 , while the transition probabilities in ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) in the figure [ transitionprob ] , are the same as in the usual uniform skw model .",
    "we have done simulations with @xmath38 = 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.75 , 0.9 .",
    "figure [ nc9 ] plots the difference between @xmath36 and @xmath35 for the domain @xmath30 when @xmath38 = 0.9 and @xmath40 .",
    "it shows that the difference between the two functions is going to zero as the lattice spacing @xmath12 goes to zero .",
    "this indicates that as the lattice spacing goes to zero , the exit distribution converges to harmonic measure .    in the conjecture",
    ", it says that the magnitude of the difference is proportional to the lattice spacing @xmath12 . to test this , we fixed the plot for @xmath41 and vertically compressed the other two plots with @xmath42 by a factor of 1/2 and @xmath43 by a factor of 1/4 .",
    "figure [ nc9sca ] shows the rescaled differences between these two functions . as we can see from the figure , three curves collapse nicely into one curve , which supports the conjecture .",
    "we also see similar results on the domain @xmath32 for the same case .",
    "figure [ ns9sca ] shows the result for the rescaled difference with @xmath44 and @xmath40 for the horizontal strip @xmath32 .",
    "the error bars in both graphs are plus or minus two standard deviations for the statistical errors .",
    "there are some places that the curves are not collapsing into one curve even within statistical error .",
    "this may come from the fact that the lattice spacing @xmath12 is nonzero , and therefore there are effects beyond first order which may still be significant .     and",

    "we ran simulations with @xmath47 in the domain @xmath30 .",
    "figure [ rl1sca ] shows the rescaled differences between the empirical cdf and the cdf of harmonic measure with the @xmath48 for the domain @xmath30 .",
    "note that the difference is rescaled as we did previously ( @xmath41 is unchanged , @xmath42 is multiplied by 1/2 and @xmath43 is multiplied by 1/4 ) .",
    "we observe that all three curves collapse into one curve .",

    "it is interesting to know whether this result holds when the transition probability is not symmetric .",
    "we have run several unsymmetric transition probabilities simulations on the nblock case , the left - blocked case and the right - blocked case . even with a small probability change compared to the transition probability in the usual uniform skw model , for example , changing the front probability @xmath45 to 0.55 in the left - blocked case ( b ) and keeping the rest of the transition probability the same as in the original model for the domain @xmath30 , the exit distribution of skw does not converge to harmonic measure .",
