    "caution is required , however , since blended objects will also satisfy this criterion and can be a source of false positives , notably when the stellar confusion is significant .",
    "sources are measured using custom software adapting tools and algorithms developed for the 2mass xsc @xcite and _ wise _ photometry pipelines @xcite .",
    "the process is semi - automated in that photometry measurements are automated , but each result is assessed by visual inspection with intervention where necessary .",
    "the first step is to remove point sources by psf subtraction which preserves the structure of the background . if necessary surrounding contaminating sources are masked ( e.g. , bright stars ) .",
    "the local background is estimated from pixel value ( trimmed average ) distribution that lies within an elliptical annulus located just outside of an ` active region ' which represents the image area that contains measurable light from the galaxy .",
    "the active region is not initially known , but it determined through successive iteration of the characterisation process until convergence is reached .",
    "the galaxy is modeled using an ellipsoid built from azimuthally averaging the ( background - subtracted ) surface brightness ; any masked pixels are recovered using a weighted combination of the local background ( to the masked source ) and the galaxy model . the best fit axis ratio and ellipticity are determined using the 3@xmath43 isophote and the galaxy shape is defined by this isophote and is assumed to be fixed at all radii .",
    "the primary ` isophotal ' photometry ( w@xmath15iso ) is then measured from the 1@xmath43 ( of the background rms ) elliptical isophote , capturing over 90% of the total light ( see jarrett et al 2013 ) .",
    "other measurements include a double srsic fit , to the inner galaxy region ( i.e. , the bulge ) and the outer region ( i.e. , the disk ) , thus allowing estimation of the total integrated flux that extends beyond the 1@xmath43 isophote . since _",
    "wise _ is confusion - noise limited , we track the photometry using a curve - of - growth table . where a large mismatch occurs between the isophotal radius and the radius where the change in flux is less than 2% ( the ` convergence point ' ) , the size of the active region is automatically decreased .",
    "this usually occurs where background levels are elevated due to a neighboring bright source which contaminates the background level .",
    "the process is iterated to adjust the active region until the source measurements have converged .",
    "once all the sources in a field are measured and modeled accordingly , the process is rerun to effectively perform galaxy - galaxy deblending . where a measurement exists for a galaxy when measuring an adjacent source , the galaxy model is subtracted in addition to neighboring point sources .",
    "this mitigates contamination from nearby resolved sources .",
    "the _ wise _ bands at 3.4  and 4.6  achieve the best spatial resolution , at 6.1  and 6.4 , respectively , and capture extended light arising from evolved stars in the bulge and disk regions . since _",
    "w1rchi2 _ can not discriminate well between faint , resolved and unresolved systems , we use the 2nd order intensity - weighted moment to describe the shape ( major and minor axis ) of the object and measure the intensity - weighted moment of the object on either side of the main axis .",
    "if the object is symmetric and resolved on both sides of the major axis ( as with a nominal resolved source ) , then each moment will have a resolved signature ( i.e. , the moment is large compared to a point source ) .",
    "if the object is , for example , a star blended with a galaxy , then their moments will be different ( one half will have a moment that is point - like , the other resolved ) .",
    "thus , taking the minimum moment value between the two halves , determines whether the source is resolved .",
    "fuzzy objects will have a large moment regardless of which major axis half that is measured ; stars or double stars will have a minimum moment that appears to be unresolved . the performance of the rfuzzy parameter is illustrated in  [ rfuzz_sec ] of the appendix .      isolating the resolved sources using the rfuzzy parameter ( in w1 )",
    "gives 1,390 and 1,368 sources in g12 and g15 , respectively , i.e. @xmath44% of the total _ wise _ matched sources in these fields .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that despite the resolution of the w1 and w2 bands , _ wise _ is far more sensitive compared to , for example , 2mass and will detect the extended light profiles from nearby galaxies .",
    "the typical w1 1@xmath43 isophotal radius is more than a factor of @xmath252 in scale compared to the equivalent 2mass k@xmath45-band isophotal radius .",
    "an illustration of this is shown in figure [ res ] where the 2mass xsc - derived scaled aperture photometry ( _ w@xmath15gmag _ ) are compared to the isophotal photometry of resolved sources in the gama g12 and g15 fields .",
    "the 2mass xsc - derived magnitudes underestimate the inferred flux due to the increased sensitivity of _",
    "wise_. note that no star subtraction or deblending has been attempted when measuring the _ w@xmath15gmag_s and contamination may be present ; as a consequence , these measurements should only be used as a last resort ( employing the offset shown in figure [ res ] to obtain the correct galaxy flux ) .",
    "the behavior of resolved sources is further explored in  [ resphot ] of the appendix .      for point sources ,",
    "the primary photometry are the profile fit measurements ( _ w@xmath15mpro _ ) , and for well - resolved sources the isophotal photometry (  3.1 ) .",
    "when the source is not well resolved , or the s / n ( signal - to - noise ) is low , the following steps are used to choose the best photometry :    * _ w@xmath15mpro _ photometry is used when the s / n is low , as measured by the isophotal aperture process for a given band : s / n of 10 , 10 , 15 and 15 for w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 , respectively . *",
    "if the rfuzzy parameter is false ( measured in the w1 band ) , classify source as unresolved and use _ w@xmath15mpro _ photometry for bands w1 and w2 . * if _ w3rchi2 _",

    "w1 is the most sensitive _ wise _ band . to obtain an accurate w1@xmath12w2 color for galaxies resolved in w1 and w2 ,",
    "the following steps are employed .",
    "firstly , an accurate w1@xmath12w2 color is determined using a matched aperture derived from the smaller of the two isophotal radii ( which is usually w2 ) .",
    "then , from the isophotal magnitude of the w1 band , the corresponding w2 magnitude is determined , thereby reflecting the sensitivity of the w1 band .",
    "this is also done for the w4 band using w3 in the same way as w1 , if sources are resolved at these wavelengths , which in gama is rare ( only 16 sources in g12 and g15 ) .",
    "we note that the w1 and w3 bands can not be matched in this way since the flux at these wavelengths is produced by different physical processes ( evolved stars vs. pah features ) .",
    "aperture corrections are applied to isophotal measurements as detailed in the explanatory supplement to the _ wise _ all - sky data release products ] .    in figure [ sens ]",
    "we plot the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for the g12 and g15 fields ; due to the additional @xmath252@xmath34 frame coverage the g15 field has higher signal - to - noise detections compared to g12 at a given w1 magnitude .",
    "the magnitude sensitivity limit in the w1 band for the g12 field is 16.6 ( 10-@xmath43 ) , 17.3 ( 5-@xmath43 ) and for g15 , 17.0 ( 10-@xmath43 ) and 17.7 ( 5-@xmath43 ) . the combined fields have a 10-sigma magnitude sensitivity limit of 16.6 or 71 @xmath47jy .",
    "the redshift distribution of sources in the two fields ( excluding upper limits ) is shown in figure [ cat1 ] .",
    "since the g15 field is more sensitive , the peak of the distribution is shifted to a slightly higher redshift compared to g12 .",
    "the two fields show very similar redshift distributions for @xmath48 ( figure [ cat1]b ) , although the g12 matches have relatively more high-@xmath49 sources .",
    "point sources are both passively and actively deblended by the _ wise _ pipeline and the _ wise _ all - sky catalog provides the _ na _ and _ nb _ blending flags where a value of  0 \" indicates no active deblending has been performed , and  1 \" if sources have been deblended ; deblending introduces an additional uncertainty on the measurement provided ( nb is the number of components that were deblended ) .",
    "however , an additional flag is needed to indicate where _ wise _ can not distinguish between gama sources ( one _ wise _ source for multiple gama sources ) and where contamination is expected to be high since more than one gama source lies within the _ wise _ beam . as such , we use an additional blending flag as determined by the proximity of neighboring gama-_wise _ sources .",
    "sources within 5  are viewed as a catastrophic blend due to the size of the _ wise _ beam and multiple gama sources will probably have the same _ wise _ source matched to it and/or have a highly uncertain match . a source within 15",
    "indicates a potential blend or contamination and is also flagged . for the analysis in this study",
    "we remove all flagged sources from our sample ( @xmath50 6% of g12 and g15 ) to ensure the cleanest _ wise _ photometry , but may bias the sample against the densest environments .",
    "rest - frame colours are determined using the gama redshift by building an sed ( spectral energy distribution ) combining the optical , near - infrared and mid - infrared flux densities and fitting to an empirical template library , consisting of 126 galaxy templates , of local well - studied and morphologically diverse galaxies ( e.g. sings , the _ spitzer _",

    "the _ wise _ relative spectral response curves are from @xcite and are available as part of the _ wise _ explanatory supplement .    the best template fit is determined by minimising the function that describes the difference between the flux density in the measured band , and the model - template flux density .",
    "each resulting best - fit is assigned a normalised score derived from the reduced @xmath40 minimisation , with the most consistent fits having values of @xmath51 and relatively poor fits with scores of @xmath52 . in the sections that follow we use only those sources with a score @xmath53 ,",
    "although the fitting accuracy is minimally important for nearby galaxies ( i.e. with low rest - frame color corrections ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the 3.4 , 4.5  and 12  bands of _ wise _ can be combined in a mid - infrared color - color diagram ( figure [ col ] ) ; the shortest bands are sensitive to the evolved stellar population and hot dust , therefore their color indicates increased activity ( agn or starburst ) .",
    "the 12  band is dominated by the 11.3  pah , as well as the dust continuum , sensitive to star formation .",
    "this color - color diagnostic is therefore useful to separate galaxy populations , particularly old stellar population - dominated , star - forming and systems dominated by agn - activity @xcite . in figure [ col]a the observed colors of the g12 and g15 are shown , and the k - corrected version , figure [ col]b , shows the distribution of the rest - frame colors .",
    "both fields have similar distributions , biased towards star - forming systems .",
    "this is not surprising given the optical selection of the _ gama _ sample .",
    "heavily obscured galaxies , notably ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are absent due to the insensitivity ( selective extinction ) of sdss and gama optical catalogs .",
    "systems globally dominated by agn - activity also appear sparse within the sample ; this is consistent with the findings of @xcite where spectroscopically - identified agn make up @xmath54 of the gama i emission - line catalog ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "to explore this further , we calculate the ` in - band ' luminosity for w1 , i.e. the luminosity of the source as measured relative to the sun in the w1 band , and use the stellar masses for gama as determined by @xcite to determine a mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio .",

    "we plot both the least - squares and maximum - likelihood lines to show the large discrepancies that may exist ; we provide relations for the maximum - likelihood ( or best fit ) only .",
    "we find very good agreement with the m@xmath57/l@xmath58 relation of @xcite based on their relatively small sample of 17 galaxies and with stellar masses effectively derived from 2@xmath59 @xmath60 band photometry .",
    "our relation for resolved low-@xmath49 sources is :    @xmath61    with @xmath62 + where m is the absolute magnitude of the source in w1 , m@xmath63 , and @xmath64 reflects the rest - frame color of the source .    for comparison to the resolved sample , in figure [ sm1]b",
    "we show all sources that meet our s / n selection criterion and redshift cut , which shows the distribution to be shifted to  warmer \" w1@xmath12w2 colors i.e. signifying systems with increased activity such as star - formation or low - power agn .",
    "in addition , the contours suggest that the distribution is made up of two populations , most probably due to passive galaxies having a larger mass - to - light ratio than disk - dominated and dwarf galaxies .",
    "we investigate this further in figure [ sm2 ] where we make a color - distinction based on the w3 measurement . by selecting galaxies with w2@xmath12w3@xmath65 ( see figure [ col ] ) we choose systems that are most likely dominated by star formation .",
    "these selected types show a clear trend with mass - to - light ( figure [ sm2]a ) , but lie parallel and offset to the relation of @xcite . but now including the passive galaxies , figure [ sm2]b , we see a clear clustering around a fixed mass - to - light ratio of @xmath66 .",
    "we conclude that the best - fit for our entire sample is :    @xmath67     + and for star - forming ( lower mass - to - light ) systems only :    @xmath68    this likely explains the shift observed in the relation for resolved sources and the entire field sample .",
    "the resolved sources are relatively nearby and will be a mix of passive and star - forming systems .",
    "however , at higher redshifts we add relatively more star - forming galaxies ( higher infrared luminosity ) causing a larger spread in w1@xmath12w2 color .",
    "notably galaxies with higher star formation rates will have a larger w1@xmath12w2 color due to more hot dust emission giving a brighter w2 measurement .",
    "also , at higher redshifts we will preferentially detect galaxies with higher star formation rates ( see next section ) .",
    "it should be noted that agn activity would have a similar effect ( as shown by the upward trend in figure [ col]b ) and some contamination from nuclear activity is inevitable .",
    "in figure [ sm3 ] we plot the residuals of the gama stellar masses ( used to calibrate the wise relation in equation 2 ) and the wise - derived values themselves .",
    "the mass estimates agree within a factor of 1.2 at @xmath69m@xmath70 ( with a standard deviation of 0.5 ) , within a factor of 0.98 at @xmath71m@xmath70 ( with a standard deviation of 0.4 ) and a factor of 0.96 at @xmath72m@xmath70 ( with a standard deviation of 0.4 ) . for stellar masses",
    "@xmath73m@xmath70 the wise - derived masses appear overall lower than the gama stellar masses .",
    "this is probably unsurprising given that the sample is dominated by star - forming galaxies ( see figure [ col ] ) and the wise 3.4  band is sensitive to the light from evolved stars in passively evolving galaxies .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we are able to transfer this understanding to _ wise _ and its 22  band .",
    "we determine the luminosity density ( @xmath74l@xmath75 ) for the 22  band and normalise by the total solar luminosity ( l@xmath76= 3.839@xmath3410@xmath77w ) .",
    "the w4 band is the least sensitive _ wise _ band , but we impose a s / n cut of 7 to ensure high quality photometry . sources flagged as agn based on optical spectroscopy diagnostics are removed from the sample .",
    "cross - matching these sources with star formation rates available for gama i , using sources with sfr between 0.1 and 100 m@xmath76yr@xmath21 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yields the best - fit relation shown in figure [ sf2 ] .",
    "the optical star formation rates are determined from h@xmath3 equivalent widths applying an extinction - correction based on the balmer decrement ( full details can be found in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are sampled to @xmath78 ( i.e. beyond which h@xmath3 is redshifted out of the observed spectral range ) .",
    "galaxies where the h@xmath3 line is contaminated by atmospheric o@xmath79 ( a band ) absorption , in the redshift range 0.155@xmath80 0.170 are not included in the sample as recommended in @xcite .",
    "the points in figure [ sf2 ] are color - coded according to balmer decrement and on average higher infrared luminosities correspond to higher balmer decrements ( i.e. , increased dust obscuration ) .",
    "however , without detailed knowledge of the dust geometry this is merely a crude comparison ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and as we discuss below , biases due to extinction are probably in play at higher redshifts .",

    "24  photometry and the relation of @xcite .",
    "this fit is somewhat steeper , likely explained by the distinction made by @xcite based on total infrared luminosity of the source and the relatively small number of sources in the @xcite sample ( but which also included local group dwarf galaxies ) .",
    "the best fit to the gama sample distribution is :    @xmath83      infrared - luminous sources will be detected by _ wise _ 22  out to moderate redshifts ( @xmath84 2 to 3 ) , but most typical galaxies would not .",
    "hence there is a strong bias for w4 detections to be luminous galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ) , which are highly obscured at optical wavelengths . the _ wise _ 12  band , on the other hand",
    ", has greater sensitivity by comparison ( see table [ match ] ) and also probes the ism , sensitive to a larger ( representative ) sampling of galaxies , and thus making it potentially the primary star formation indicator for _ wise_. the dominant feature within this w3 band is the 11.3  pah ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ) , and to a lesser extent the @xmath13neii@xmath14 $ ] emission line .",
    "this pah is large , neutral and excited by ultraviolet radiation from young stars , as well as radiation from older , evolved stars ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath13neii@xmath14 $ ] is associated with emission from hii  regions .",
    "passive disks generally lack the 7.7  pah tracing current star formation , but still show prominent 11.3  pah features ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "as first demonstrated with _ spitzer _",
    "measurements ( see for example * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pahs can be used to estimate star formation , although there is larger scatter ( and potential biases ) relative to the superior 24  mid - infrared or 70  far - infrared tracers .",
    "the _ wise _ 12  band is thus a powerful , yet also more problematic , tracer of recent star formation .",
    "we proceed as with w4 , but with a s / n cut of 10 in the w3 ( 12  band ) , similarly color - coding to reflect balmer decrement ( figure [ sf1]a ) .",
    "a contour plot of the distribution is shown in figure [ sf1]b and the trend appears very tight for sfr @xmath85 . at low sfr and @xmath74l@xmath75 , however , the distribution appears to flatten and probably accounts for the differences in slope between our relation and the least squares fit of @xcite.the relation of @xcite lies offset below our best fit , most likely as a result of relatively low sfr within their small sample ( sfr @xmath86 ) of nearby galaxies .",
    "the best fit relation for the 12  band is :    @xmath87    this flattening of the distribution in figure [ sf1 ] at low sfr is most likely a feature of the 11.3  pah tracer ( since we do not observe it at 22 ) and is also observed by @xcite in their study .    given that the 12 micron band emission appears too low for the given h@xmath3 sfr , a possible explanation is that the relative abundance of pah molecules to big grain emission is diminished , due to low metalicity in these galaxies . if this is the case , we do not expect to see a similar effect at 22 micron , since this band is dominated by big grains in equilibrium with the strong radiation fields inside star formation regions .",
    "indeed , the 22  sample of @xcite does not show such a flattening .",
    "an alternative explanation would be that in a low sfr regime , the preponderance of the diffuse medium increases with respect to the star - formation component of the interstellar medium ( galaxies are more quiescent ) .",
    "bear in mind that the 24  warm dust emission is powered by the uv radiation fields from the massive stars inside the star forming regions , while the 12  emission is mainly powered by the diffuse interstellar radiation fields @xcite .",
    "thus , the pah and small grains emission seen in the 12  band increases with increasing sfr , but this increase is mediated by the propagation of the uv photons in the diffuse ism , while the 24  emission directly traces star formation regions , as does the balmer line corrected h@xmath3 emission from which the sfrs are derived .    to investigate this",
    "further we show individual points for contiguous redshift slices overplotted on the full sample in figure [ sf3 ] ; this serves as an indication of how the distribution is built up .",
    "the flattening at low sfr appears to be a feature of nearby sources alone ( figure [ sf3]a ) supporting the hypothesis that we are observing the pah features and small grain emission of relatively quiescent galaxies , dominated by the diffuse ism .",
    "the flattening in the slope is not detected at higher redshifts ( @xmath88 ) as these galaxies have more star formation activity ( i.e. more clumpy ) . in figures",
    "[ sf3]b - d we see how as we move to higher redshifts , we sample systems with higher @xmath89 and , on average , higher sfrs .",
    "the relatively low number of sources in figure [ sf3]d reflects the atmospheric contamination affecting sources at redshifts of @xmath90 .",
    "the higher infrared luminosity in these sources , however , also indicate greater obscuration in the optical bands ; this explains the sharp drop in h@xmath3 luminosities relative to w3 , apparent in figs .",
    "10c and d with sfr(h@xmath3 ) @xmath46 3 m@xmath76yr@xmath21 .",
    "corrections using the balmer decrement become ineffective when the extinctions are high , ( av @xmath91 ) , which is why infrared tracers of obscured star formation and uv / optical tracers of unobscured star formation are best combined to estimate the total star formation rate .",
    "the gama-_wise _ catalog and empirically - derived relations can be used any number of ways to probe the behaviour of large populations of galaxies . to illustrate",

    "we show specific star formation as a function of stellar mass , color - coded by redshift .",

    "the behavior of star formation and specific star formation , as a function of stellar mass and redshift , within the gama sample is explored in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observed increase in mean ssfr of star - forming galaxies with increasing redshift is well - established ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the magnitude sensitivity limit in the w3 band for the g12 field is 13.2 ( 10-@xmath43 ) , 14.0 ( 5-@xmath43 ) and for g15 , 13.8 ( 10-@xmath43 ) and 14.5 ( 5-@xmath43 ) .",
    "the 12-derived star formation rates , computed from equation ( 5 ) , can also be used to investigate ssfr trends within populations of gama galaxies .",
    "for example , we use the updated gama ii galaxy group catalogue ( g@xmath99cv6 ) , as detailed in @xcite , to isolate galaxies that reside within a pair . in g@xmath99c a galaxy pair is defined as two galaxies within 100@xmath100 , in physical separation , and 1000 kms@xmath21 in velocity separation .",
    "figure [ pairs ] is a normalised histogram of all galaxies in the sample with stellar mass @xmath101 10@xmath102m@xmath76 and the subset that reside in a pair ( 17,475 galaxies ) and a close pair ( i.e. separation @xmath103 ) .",
    "we note that potential blends ( as outlined in  [ blend ] ) are removed .    the striking feature of figure [ pairs]a is that galaxies that reside within a pair appear to have , on average , lower ssfr than a typical gama galaxy of the same mass , suggesting that instead of star formation being enhanced in these systems , it is suppressed .",
    "although initially counter - intuitive , and contrary to studies of local galaxy pairs compared to field control samples ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it should be noted that @xmath104 of gama galaxies reside within a group , with numerous mechanisms at play . within the context ,",
    "therefore , of the environment of a typical galaxy this highlights the complexity of interacting and merging systems and is discussed further in a detailed study of merging and interacting galaxies within gama ( robotham et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "we note that a lack of sfr enhancement has emerged from studies of galaxy pairs probing higher redshift samples ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with one suggested explanation that higher gas fractions at higher redshift reduce the efficiency of torque - driven gas infall .",
    "further we include in figure [ pairs]b a histogram of galaxies within 20kpc / h of their neighbor , as compared to the distribution from figure [ pairs]a .",
    "it appears that this subset shows a broader range of ssfrs compared to the larger sample of galaxies in pairs , and may even be bimodal , consisting of suppressed systems and enhanced systems . adding this kinematic trigger to galaxy evolution is clearly a complex process , but crucial to understand how galaxies evolve in the group environment .",
    "finally , we note that blending limitations of the _ wise _ data within pairs that have a smaller separation make this parameter space uncertain , but optical tracers will be exploited here in forthcoming gama papers .",
    "we have detailed the procedure for creating a source - matched catalog between galaxies in the gama g12 and g15 fields , and _ wise _ photometry . in particular",
    "we have outlined how best to extract photometry for low signal to noise , unresolved and resolved sources in the _ wise _ all - sky catalog .",

    "in order to understand the photometry of resolved and partially resolved sources in _ wise _ we use several diagnostics . since _",
    "wise _ is calibrated in the vega system , images and all - sky catalogs , all comparisons are done as such .        1 .   the source is rotated to determine the optimal 2nd moment parameters ( rmajor , rminor , position angle of major axis ) 2 .",
    "the source is divided along the minor axis into two halves : positive x , and negative x , where the central x position is the nominal position of the source 3 .",

    "the rfuzzy@xmath110 is determined by measuring sources that are expected to be unresolved .",
    "for example , figure [ rfuzz ] shows the rfuzzy values for _ wise _ sources in the gama g12 region with _ w1rchi2_@xmath462 which preferentially selects unresolved sources .",
    "the typical value for rfuzzy is @xmath2510.0  for high signal to noise point sources ( e.g. stars ) , but the distribution can be used to identify the limit where resolvedness can be determined .",
    "a power series fit to the 2@xmath43 mean of the distribution yields the rfuzzy@xmath110 curve  points that lie above this curve are classified as resolved .",
    "rfuzzy can be defined in terms of isophotal signal to noise or isophotal magnitude .",
    "given the differing exposure coverage ( number of _ wise _ frames that samples a given patch of sky ) for the entire sky , the sensitivity limits vary depending on location on the sky .",
    "for this reason , a magnitude - dependent rfuzzy@xmath110 curve will be sensitive to the _ wise _ coverage and would need to be derived for each region .",
    "however , a signal to noise function is robust against this and therefore the curve shown in figure [ rfuzz]a is used .    as a test of the performance of the rfuzzy parameter , figure [ rfuzz_perf ] plots rfuzzy for a sample from gama g12 expected to be dominated by resolved systems ( based on _ w1rchi2 _ ) . the majority of sources with _",

    "this shows that the largest offset between the w1iso and _ w1mpro _ photometry measurements occurs for sources deemed resolved by the rfuzzy parameter .",

    "n the isophotal measurement becomes unreliable  in some cases the fluxes are inflated , notably for w3 and w4  due to contamination from background sources and _ w@xmath15mpro _ provide the most robust measurement .",
    "in figure [ delmag_rchi_sn ] we again use the difference between w@xmath15iso and _ w@xmath15mpro _ photometry to illustrate that the sensitivity of the w1 and w2 bands prevents the _ w1rchi2 _ and _ w2rchi _ values from acting as a reliable discriminator of resolvedness . for w3 and w4 ,",

    "we explore the relationship between the isophotal photometry and the _ w@xmath15gmag _",
    "photometry for sources in the 2mass xsc . since the _",

    "we note that _ w@xmath15gmag_s can be contaminated by nearby objects since no attempt is made to remove neighboring sources . in figure",
    "[ resplots ] we show the difference between _ w@xmath15gmag _ and w@xmath15iso photometry for resolved galaxies in g12 and g15 .",
