    "the @xmath2 colliders which have operated in the past twenty years , from spear to lep1 and slc , have been very successful in searching for the fundamental constituents of matter and in exploring their interactions . in particular",
    ", the recent high  precision studies of the properties of the @xmath6 boson at lep1 and slc , have laid a very solid base for the standard model ( sm ) of the electroweak and strong interactions . however , within the sm , many problems remain to be solved and despite of the spectacular agreement with the present experimental data , extensions of the model are anticipated .",
    "@xmath7 the top quark , recently discovered at the tevatron , has a mass of @xmath8 gev .",
    "this high value renders a thorough analysis of the properties of this particle mandatory : since the mass is close to the fermi scale , the top quark might hold important clues to the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism .    @xmath7 the strength and the form of the electroweak @xmath9 and @xmath6 boson self ",
    "couplings are determined by the non  abelian gauge symmetry of the sm .",
    "however , deviations from these values are expected in more general scenarios . these couplings can be measured at existing colliders only with large errors , and the precision must be improved by one or two orders of magnitude to unambiguously establish the nature of these particles .",
    "@xmath7 the higgs particle , and the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism , are the most important ingredients of the sm .",
    "the search for the higgs particle will be a major task and it is very important that no way of escape is left for this particle .",
    "once discovered , its fundamental properties , spin  parity quantum numbers and couplings to the other particles , must be precisely determined .",
    "@xmath7 supersymmetry ( susy ) is the most attractive extension of the sm .",
    "it not only stabilizes the huge hierarchy between the weak and the gut scales against radiative corrections , but also if susy is broken at a sufficiently high scale , it allows us to understand the origin of the hierarchy in terms of radiative gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , susy models offer a natural solution to the dark matter problem and allow for a consistent unification of the all known gauge couplings .",
    "many new particles are predicted in these theories ; the search for these states and the study of their properties will be one of the major goals of present and future colliders .",
    "@xmath7 many other possibilities for extensions of the sm can be anticipated .",
    "for instance , the sm group su(3)@xmath10su(2)@xmath10u(1 ) is expected to be embedded in a unifying group at a high  energy scale . in this case , extra gauge bosons with masses not too far from the fermi scale might exist . in these unifying groups , many new matter particles are also predicted and some of them might be relatively light .",
    "these new gauge and matter particles have also to be searched for at present and futur colliders .",
    "while strongly interacting particles , as well as new gauge bosons , can be easily searched for at hadron colliders , @xmath2 colliders provide unique opportunities to search for non  colored particles such as higgs bosons , susy partners of leptons and electroweak / higgs bosons and , due to a clean experimental environment , to make detailed studies of their properties . even for strongly interacting ( s)particles and new gauge bosons",
    ", the @xmath2 colliders can play an important role in pining down their properties .    in this talk",
    ", i will discuss the potential of future high  energy @xmath11 linear colliders to address these issues , after summarizing some aspects of the @xmath2 reaction and the future machines .",
    "the talk is based on the work done at the various workshops on @xmath2 colliders [ 16 ] which took place in the last years to which i refer for original references .",
    "the @xmath2 collision is a very simple reaction , with a well defined initial state and rather simple topologies in the final state .",
    "it has a favorable signal to background ratio , leading to a very clean experimental environment which allows to easily search for new phenomena and to perform very high  precision studies as has been shown at pep / petra and more recently at lep / slc .",
    "the physical processes are mainly mediated by @xmath12channel photon and @xmath6 boson exchanges with cross sections which scale like @xmath13 , and @xmath14channel gauge boson or electron / neutrino exchange , with cross sections which rise like @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath12channel exchange is the most interesting process : it is democratic in the sense that it gives approximately the same rates for weakly and strongly interacting ( matter ) particles and for the production of known and new particles .",
    "however the rates are low at high energies , and one needs to increase the luminosity to compensate for the @xmath13 drop of the interesting cross sections . at @xmath16 tev , one needs a luminosity of @xmath17 @xmath18s@xmath19 , or equivalently an integrated luminosity of @xmath20 fb@xmath19 per year , to produce 10.000 muon pairs as at pep and petra .",
    "such a luminosity is necessary to allow for thorough data analyses , including cuts on the event samples and allowing for acceptance losses in the detectors . at higher energies",
    ", the luminosity should be scaled up as @xmath12 to generate the same number of events .",
    "various reference designs of future high  energy @xmath2 colliders are being studied at desy , slac , kek , novosibirsk and cern . in the following ,",
    "let me briefly list a few points about these future colliders [ 13 ] :    @xmath7 because of synchrotron radiation which rises as the fourth power of the c.m .",
    "energy in circular machines , @xmath2 colliders beyond lep2 must be linear machines , a type of accelerator which has been pioneered by the slc .",
    "@xmath7 these machines will be probably realized in two steps .",
    "i a first phase , they will operate in the energy range between 300 and 500 gev with a yearly luminosity of @xmath21 fb@xmath19 , and in a second phase with a center of mass energy up to @xmath22 tev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath23 fb@xmath19 .",
    "energy of the colliders can be adjusted in order to make detailed studies : for instance to scan the @xmath24 threshold or to maximize the cross section for higgs boson production .",
    "@xmath7 the requirement of a high  luminosity is achieved by squeezing the electrons and positrons into bunches of very small transverse size , leading to beamstrahlung which results into beam energy loss and the smearing of the initially sharp @xmath2 c.m . energy .",
    "since the precise knowledge of the initial state is very important for precision studies , beamstrahlung should be reduced to a very low level , as it is already the case in narrow beam designs .",
    "@xmath7 the longitudinal polarization of the electron ( and possibly positron ) beam should be easy to obtain as it has already been shown at the slc",
    ". the longitudinal polarization might be very important when it comes to make very precise measurements of the properties of the top quark and the @xmath1 bosons for instance .",
    "@xmath7 last but not least , the @xmath2 collider can run in three additional modes .",
    "first , one just needs to replace the positron bunches by electron bunches to have an @xmath25 collider .",
    "then , by illuminating the electron and positron bunches by laser photons , one can convert the @xmath2 collider into an @xmath26 or @xmath27 collider with a comparable total c.m .",
    "energy and luminosity as the initial @xmath2 collider .",
    "these modes will be very useful to address problems such as the higgs ",
    "photons coupling and the properties of the @xmath9 bosons .",
    "i the rest of this talk , i will nevertheless mainly focus on the @xmath2 option of the collider and discuss only the physics potential at the first phase with a center of mass energy around @xmath28 gev .",
    "occasionally , i will comment on the benefits of raising the energy or changing the option .",
    "the first and most obvious thing to do at a 500 gev @xmath2 collider is the study of the properties of the top quark .",
    "since the top quark is very massive , @xmath29 gev , it might play a very important role in the understanding of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and the properties of this particle should be studied in detail .    in @xmath2 collisions ,",
    "top quarks are mainly produced through @xmath12channel @xmath30 and @xmath6 boson exchange , @xmath31 .",
    "the maximum cross section is reached at about 50 gev above threshold , i.e. at @xmath32 gev , fig.1 .",
    "a rate of 40.000 top quark pairs can be produced with a luminosity of @xmath33 fb@xmath19 , a sample comparable to the number of top quark which can be used for physics at the lhc , after filtering out the background .",
    "the top quarks will mainly decay into @xmath34 quarks and @xmath9 bosons , @xmath35 , and in the clean environment of @xmath2 colliders , the top quarks can be easily isolated .",
    "the very sharp rise of the @xmath24 production cross near threshold , due to the well  know coulomb singularity , would allow a very high  precision measurement of the top quark mass .",
    "conservative estimates of the theoretical and experimental uncertainties lead to an error of about 200 mev on @xmath36 , more than an order of magnitude smaller than what is expected to be the case at the lhc .",
    "this precision will allow the first stringent constraint on the mass of the higgs boson if this particle has not been found .",
    "because of its large mass , the top quark will decay before it forms @xmath24 bound states , and the @xmath14 and @xmath37 will separate at distances less than @xmath38 fm .",
    "however , the @xmath39 cross section near the production threshold is still sensitive to the quark  antiquark binding potential .",
    "therefore , the threshold region will be the best place to study qcd : the binding is strong , but it is completely determined by perturbation theory . from the qcd potential ,",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath40 could be determined with an error of less than 0.4% , and this would be the most precise individual measurement of this coupling .    the measurement of @xmath36 and @xmath40 from the excitation curve will be however correlated . to decorrelate the two measurements",
    ", one can determine the momentum distribution of the top quark , the average of which is proportional to the product of the two quantities , @xmath41 .",
    "the top quark width [ as well as @xmath36 and @xmath40 ] can be determined from the forward  backward asymmetry .",
    "indeed , the interference between s and p  wave contributions near threshold is rather strong , leading to a fb asymmetry of about 10% . for fixed @xmath36 and @xmath40 ,",
    "this allows the determination of @xmath43 with a precision of less than 20% .",
    "note that the qcd coupling constant can also be determined independently by measuring the annihilation cross section into jets , allowing for a stringent test of asymptotic freedom down to distances of @xmath44 ) fm .",
    "because of the short lifetime of the top quark , its polarization is not lost during the decay making possible a general helicity analysis of the angular distribution of the process @xmath45 + 4fermions",
    ". this will allow the determination of the electroweak @xmath24 production and the weak ( @xmath46 ) decay currents .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment , the electric dipole moment [ a sign of cp violation in the @xmath14 sector ] and the chirality of the ( @xmath46 ) current [ left  handed in the sm ] can be determined at a high level .",
    "this allows to constrain many extensions of the sm , such as multi ",
    "higgs doublet models , models of dynamical symmetry breaking and compositeness , which might manifest themselves first in the top sector due the large value of @xmath36 .",
    "finally , it might well be that the top quark does not decay only into @xmath47 final states . due to the large value of @xmath48",
    ", there could be enough phase space for exotic decay modes to occur .",
    "for instance , in supersymmetric extensions of the sm , the top quark could decay into a @xmath34 quark and a charged higgs boson , @xmath49 , or into the lightest neutralino @xmath50 [ which is the lightest supersymmetric particle ] and the scalar top squark @xmath51 [ which in many scenarios is lighter than the @xmath14 and all the other squarks ] , @xmath52 .",
    "even if these exotic decay modes are allowed by phase space , they are expected to be rare , with branching ratios of the order of a few percent .",
    "this rates would be frequent enough , however , to be analysed thoroughly at @xmath2 colliders .",
    "the gauge symmetries of the sm completely determine the form and the strength of the self - interactions of the electroweak bosons .",
    "deviations of the triple @xmath53 and quartic @xmath54 couplings , as well as new couplings @xmath55 in addition to the usual sm couplings , could be expected in more general scenarios .",
    "for instance in composite models and models where the @xmath1 bosons are generated dynamically or interact strongly with each other , these couplings can be altered .",
    "the couplings @xmath56 and @xmath57 are in general described by seven parameters each .",
    "assuming c , p and t invariance in the bosonic sector , the number of parameters is reduced to three : @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath58 are the electric and @xmath6 charges of the @xmath9 bosons and the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are related to the corresponding magnetic dipole moments and electric quadripole moments of the @xmath9 bosons .",
    "symmetries of the underlying dynamical interactions may further constrain these couplings .",
    "the gauge symmetries of the sm , demand that @xmath61 and @xmath62 at tree  level .",
    "the magnetic dipole and electric quadripole moments can be measured directly in the production of electroweak bosons at hadron and @xmath2 colliders .",
    "modifications of the self ",
    "couplings vertices destroy the sm unitarity cancellations between interfering boson and fermion exchange amplitudes for longitudinal vector boson production . as a result",
    ", small deviations of the moments from their sm values are magnified by a coefficient @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the velocity of the @xmath9 bosons .",
    "because the constraints also scale with the accumulated luminosity , a 500 gev @xmath2 collider with a luminosity of @xmath65 fb@xmath19 will have a sensitivity which is two orders of magnitude larger than lep2 .    the main reaction to be exploited at high ",
    "energy @xmath2 colliders is @xmath9 pair production @xmath66 .",
    "a large number , @xmath67 , of @xmath9 pairs will be produced in a clean environment for the energy and luminosity specified above , so that a very high reconstruction efficiency can be achieved .",
    "additional and complementary information can be obtained from @xmath68 fusion to @xmath6 bosons , @xmath69 , and in particular if laser induced @xmath30 beams are available , from @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "these processes are separately sensitive to @xmath30 and @xmath6 couplings , and can help to disentangle @xmath72 from @xmath73 .    from the combined analysis of the @xmath9 pair production cross section and the angular distribution of the @xmath9 decay products [ which allow to separate the various @xmath9 helicity components ] , very tight constraints on the anomalous couplings can be obtained .",
    "if all @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s are allowed to vary freely , they can be probed to an accuracy of latexmath:[$|\\kappa_\\gamma -1| , \\",
    ", |\\kappa_z-1 , \\ , |\\lambda_\\gamma| , \\",
    ",    more stringent bounds can be obtained if the anomalous couplings are constrained by additional symmetry requirements . to disentangle @xmath30 from @xmath6 couplings in this reaction , longitudinal polarization is very important .",
    "the analysis of @xmath77 final states at the tevatron leads to bounds of @xmath78 on the anomalous photonic couplings . at the lhc ,",

    "@xmath2 colliders are more powerful by not only probing @xmath89 and @xmath90 to a higher accuracy , but also in providing stringent constraints on @xmath81 and @xmath91 .",
    "note that the constraints become more stringent at higher energies or higher luminosities .",

    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) requires the existence of two isodoublets of higgs fields , leading to three neutral , @xmath177(cp=+ ) , @xmath178(cp= ) and a pair of charged scalar particles . besides the four masses , two additional parameters define the properties of these particles : a mixing angle @xmath179 in the neutral cp  even sector and the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values @xmath180 , which from gut restrictions is assumed in the range @xmath181 .",
    "supersymmetry leads to several relations among these parameters and only two of them [ in general @xmath180 and @xmath182 are in fact independent . in the mssm , the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson @xmath183 is shifted from the tree level value @xmath184 to @xmath185 gev .",
    "the masses of the heavy neutral and charged higgs particles can be expected , with a high probability , in the range of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "some of these features are not specific to the minimal extension and are expected to be realized also in more general susy models .",
    "for instance , a light higgs boson with a mass below @xmath186(200 gev ) is quite generally predicted by susy theories .    at hadron colliders ,",
    "the search for the higgs bosons of the mssm will be even more difficult than for the sm higgs boson .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the important decays of the neutral higgs particles into @xmath27 and @xmath119 final states have in general smaller branching ratios , especially if decays into susy particles are kinematically allowed .",
    "if @xmath187 is close to its maximum value , @xmath183 has sm like couplings and the situation is similar to the sm case with @xmath188 100140 gev .    in @xmath2 collisions , besides the usual higgs  strahlung and fusion processes for the production of the cp  even higgs bosons @xmath183 and @xmath189 , the neutral higgs particles can also be produced pairwise : @xmath190 .",
    "the cross sections [ fig .",
    "6a ] for the higgs  strahlung and the pair production as well as the cross sections for the production of @xmath183 and @xmath189 are mutually complementary , coming either with a coefficient @xmath191 or @xmath192 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath193 production is large for large values of @xmath187 , being of @xmath194 fb ) ; by contrast , the cross section for @xmath195 is large for light @xmath183 [ implying small @xmath102 ] . in major parts of the parameter space ,",
    "the signals consist of a @xmath6 boson and a @xmath115 or a @xmath116 pair , which is easy to separate from the main background , @xmath133 [ for @xmath196 , efficient @xmath34 detection is needed ] . for the associated production ,",
    "the situation is opposite : the cross section for @xmath197 is large for light @xmath183 whereas @xmath198 production is preferred in the complementary region .",
    "the signals consist mostly of four @xmath34 quarks in the final state , requiring efficient @xmath115 quark tagging ; mass constraints help to eliminate the qcd jets and @xmath119 backgrounds .",
    "the cp  even higgs particles can also be searched for in the @xmath68 and @xmath119 fusion mechanisms . charged higgs bosons",
    "can be produced pairwise , @xmath199 through @xmath200 exchange .",
    "the cross section depends only on @xmath201 and is large up to @xmath202  gev .",
    "charged higgs bosons can also be produced in top decays as discussed previously .",
    "the discussion on the mssm higgs sector in @xmath2 linear colliders can be summarized in the following points : i ) the higgs boson @xmath183 can be detected in the _ entire _ range of the mssm parameter space , either through the bremsstrahlung process or through pair production ; fig .",
    "in fact , this conclusion holds true even at a c.m .",
    "energy of 300 gev and with a luminosity of a few fb@xmath19 .",
    "ii ) there is a substantial area of the ( @xmath203 ) parameter space where _ all _ susy higgs bosons can be discovered at a 500 gev collider ; fig .",
    "this is possible if the @xmath204 and @xmath205 masses are less than @xmath206 gev . for higher masses ,",
    "one simply has to increase the c.m . energy .",
    "iii ) in some parts of the mssm parameter space , the lightest higgs @xmath183 can be detected , but it can not be distinguished from the sm higgs boson . in this case , higgs production in @xmath27 fusion [ which receives extra contributions from susy loops ] can be helpful .",
    "iv ) the properties of the higgs bosons can also be accurately determined ; for instance , in the case of @xmath183 , the same tests as for the sm higgs can be made .",
    "the lightest neutralinos and charginos , which are mixtures of the supersymmetric partners of the electroweak gauge bosons and higgs bosons , are expected to be the lightest supersymmetric particles [ especially the lightest neutralino , which in the mssm with conserved r  parity , is the lightest susy particle and is stable ] . to avoid unnatural fine tuning in radiative corrections ,",
    "these particles should have masses below the fermi scale .",
    "neutralinos and charginos are difficult to find at hadron colliders , but they are easy to detect at @xmath2 colliders .",
    "they are produced in pairs , @xmath207 ( @xmath208 and @xmath209 @xmath2104 ) , through @xmath12channel @xmath211 exchange , and @xmath14channel sneutrino or selectron exchange .",
    "the cross sections can be rather large , @xmath212 fb ) at @xmath171 gev , and enough events will be produced to discover these particles and study their properties .",
    "detailed experimental simulations have shown that these particles can be found with masses up to the beam energy , if the mass difference with the lightest neutralino is not less than 20 gev , substantialy improving on the discovery reach of lep2 .    left or right  handed scalar particles",
    "correspond to each chiral sm fermion . starting with a universal scalar mass @xmath213 at the gut scale , squark and slepton",
    "masses evolve differently down to low energies , the later being significantly smaller than the former [ with the possible exception of the stop squark ] .",
    "the susy partners of leptons may have masses below the fermi scale .",
    "in @xmath2 collisions , sleptons are produced pairwise @xmath214 , through @xmath12channel @xmath215 exchange .",
    "for sneutrinos only @xmath6 exchange is present , for selectrons and electronic sneutrinos additional chargino / neutralino @xmath14channel exchanges are present .",
    "the cross sections are large , @xmath216 $ \\sim$}}~}50 $ ] fb for @xmath28 gev , and these states can be discovered up to the kinematical limit if the slepton masses are larger than the lightest neutralino mass by more than a few ten gev .",
    "while colored squarks [ except for the stop squarks ] and gluinos can be detected up to masses of @xmath108 tev ) at lhc , the sleptons are very hard to detect due to the low production rates and the large backgrounds , so that @xmath2 colliders are unique in this sector . in @xmath2 collisions , one can also measure the masses of the scalar particles [ which is difficult at hadron colliders because of the escaping lsp s ] and their couplings .",
    "this is very important in order to constrain the various susy scenarios .    finally , due to the large value of @xmath36 , the lightest stop quark can be lighter than the top quark and all the other squarks . because of the large backgrounds , stop squarks are also difficult to find at the lhc while they can be easily detected in @xmath2 collisions with masses up to the beam energy .",
    "the sm does not unify the electroweak and strong forces in a satisfactory way since the couplings of these interactions are different",
    ". therefore one would expect that a more fundamental theory exists which describes the three forces within the context of a single gauge group [ which will contain the sm as a subgroup and will reduce to it at low energies ] and hence , with only one coupling constant .",
    "the lep data show that this can be indeed achieved in supersymmetric grand unified theories .",
    "two predictions of gut can have dramatic phenomenological consequences in the @xmath217(tev ) energy range : ( i ) the unifying group must be spontaneously broken at the unification scale for the proton to be stable ; however , it is possible that the breaking to the sm group occurs in several steps and that some subgroups remain unbroken down to a scale of order 1 tev allowing for new neutral gauge bosons @xmath218 with masses not far from the fermi scale .",
    "( ii ) the gut groups incorporate fermion representations in which a complete generation of sm quarks and leptons can be naturally embedded and in most cases these representations are large enough to accomodate additional new fermions .",
    "these fermions , which are needed to have anomaly  free theories , can have masses not much larger than the fermi scale .",
    "in addition , particles with exotic quantum numbers such as difermions [ leptoquarks , diquarks and dileptons ] , could occur .",
    "the direct search for these new matter and gauge particles and tests of their indirect effects will be a major goal of the next generation of accelerators and high ",
    "energy @xmath2 linear colliders have a rather rich potential for these searches .",
    "if the energy can be raised high enough , the @xmath2 collider will operate as a @xmath6 factory ; the event rates will be very high and the properties of the @xmath219 can be studied in great details .",
    "a heavy @xmath219 boson , even if its mass is substantially larger than the available center of mass energy , will manifest itself through its propagator effects in the process @xmath220 fermions , producing potentially sizeable effects on the leptonic cross section @xmath221 , the ratio @xmath222 , the forward ",
    "backward asymmetry @xmath223 and if longitudinal polarization is available , the left ",
    "right asymmetries @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "masses up to 6 times the c.m .",
    "energy of the collider can be probed for the expected luminosities .",
    "if a @xmath219 with mass below 3 tev is discovered at lhc , even a 500 gev @xmath2 collider would give valuable contributions to its detailed investigation by allowing the distinction between different classes of models and the determination of the model parameters .",
    "the two types of colliders would then provide complementary information .",
    "@xmath2 colliders are well suited machines for the search of new leptons .",
    "these particles can be pair produced , @xmath226 , with large rates if their masses are smaller than the beam energy .",
    "they can also be singly produced in association with their standard light partners , @xmath227 if the mixing between the light and heavy states is not prohibitively small ; one can then reach masses close to the total energy of the collider .",
    "the signatures , with final states involving charged leptons and gauge bosons , have clear characteristics so that the detection of these particles should not be difficult in the clean environment of @xmath2 colliders .",
    "since they are strongly interacting particles , quarks , leptoquarks and diquarks will be produced at the lhc with very large rates . however , because of the difficult hadronic jet background , the signals would be hard to analyze in detail .",
    "@xmath2 colliders would provide the ideal framework for highly precise analyses of the properties of these new exotic particles if they are found at the hadron colliders .",
    "@xmath2 linear colliders operating in the energy range of @xmath228 gev [ and which can be extended to energies up to 2 tev ] have a very rich physics potential , which in many aspects is complementary to that of the lhc .",
    "high  precision measurements in the top quark and @xmath1 bosons sectors can be performed , allowing further tests of the standard model and eventually opening a window to new physics .",
    "the exploration of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism can be made at great details : higgs particles can be easily searched for , and the clean environment of the collider allows detailed studies of their basic properties .",
    "the @xmath2 colliders provide a unique opportunity to explore in a deep manner central aspects of supersymmetric theories : the higgs spectrum and its properties , the higgsino / gaugino and slepton sectors .",
    "finally , gauge extensions of the standard model can be explored by searching for new gauge bosons and new matter particles .",
