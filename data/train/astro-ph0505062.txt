    "the recent observation of gravitationally redshifted atomic transition lines during type i x - ray bursts on the low - mass x - ray binary , exo  0748 - 676 ( cottam , paerels & mendez 2002 , hereafter cpm ) opens a new window on neutron star ( ns ) structure . using 335 ks of xmm - newton observations during its calibration and commissioning phase , cpm collected 3.2 ks of type i bursts which was split into a high temperature part ( @xmath5 ) and a low temperature part ( @xmath6 ) . in the high temperature part they identified the h@xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) transition of hydrogenic fe with a redshift of z=0.35 .",
    "the same transition was identified for he - like fe with the same redshift in the low temperature part . though this is not the first claim of an absorption feature during type i x - ray bursts , previous tenma and exosat observations of a 4.1 kev absorption feature on 2s 1636 - 536 ( waki et al . 1984 ; turner & breedon 1984 ) , exo 1747 - 214 ( magnier et al . 1989 ) and x1608 - 52 ( nakamura , inoue & tanaka 1988 ) were never confirmed with more sensitive instruments .",
    "cpm s observation is unique in that two lines in distinct states of the type i burst with the same redshift were observed , implying that we are seeing the ns surface .    in our previous work ( bildsten , chang & paerels 2003 , hereafter bcp ) ,",
    "we explained how fe can be present above the accreting ns photosphere .",
    "the larger entropy of the photosphere forbids convective mixing from the deeper burning regions ( joss 1977 ) , making it unlikely that fe is dredged up .",
    "in addition , the strong surface gravity rapidly depletes fe from the upper atmosphere via sedimentation . ]",
    ". however , continual accretion during the burst at fairly modest rates ( @xmath8 ) can overcome fe sedimentation . for , the persistent flux implies @xmath9 ( gottwald et al .",
    "1986 ; cpm ) and the sub - eddington burst luminosity is unlikely to halt the accretion flow ( see observations of gx 17 + 2 ; kuulkers et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "if accretion is the source of the fe that generates the absorption line , then accretion must be spread over a large fraction of the star . since",
    "the ns surface is inside the last stable orbit for the implied radius of @xmath10 ( cpm ) , the protons may reach the ns surface with a kinetic energy of @xmath11 mev / nucleon , and decelerate via coulomb scattering ( zeldovich & shakura 1969 ) .",
    "this filters ions by their charge and mass , stopping incident fe above the photosphere at a column of @xmath12 ( bildsten , salpeter & wasserman 1992 ) .",
    "the fe remains there until it is either destroyed by incident protons ( for @xmath13 ) or sediments out .",
    "the deposition and nuclear destruction of fe both depend linearly on @xmath14 and hence the steady state fe column is independent of @xmath14 when nuclear destruction dominates . for accretion of solar metallicity material , @xmath15 ( bcp ) . while this fe column is similar to a uniformly abundant solar metallicity atmosphere ( @xmath16 ) , the accretion / spallation scenario also predicts a plethora of elements with @xmath17 produced by proton spallation of fe ( bcp , table 1 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the physics of line transfer through a thin fe layer above the continuum photosphere .",
    "previous theoretical work on the formation of spectral features focused on the fe ly@xmath0 line and edge ( foster et al . 1987 ; day , fabian & ross 1992 ) . however , these calculations presumed lte and uniform abundance . in   [ sec : model_atmosphere ] we show that lte is a poor assumption as the radiation field dominates the level population and ionization balance ( london , taam & howard 1986 ; bcp ) .",
    "we also discuss the line broadening physics and show that stark broadening dominates for fe h@xmath0 .",
    "we calculate in   [ sec : line_formation_calculations ] the fe column needed to produce the observed h@xmath0 line and compare it to the fe column from accretion / spallation .",
    "we also estimate the equivalent width of the resulting ly@xmath0 and p@xmath0 transition , and constrain the rotation rate of the ns from the observed linewidth .",
    "we close by estimating the fe column that might be sustained by radiative levitation , and summarize our results in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we model the thin fe line forming region as a one - zone scattering layer ( mihalas 1978 ) at fixed temperature and density that is illuminated from below by the continuum photosphere ( see figure [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "we consider radiation and gas temperatures of @xmath18 kev , in which case the atmospheric microphysics is simplified .",
    "the continuum opacity , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the absorption opacity ( mostly free - free ) and @xmath21 is the thomson scattering opacity , is dominated by electron scattering .",
    "bound - free transitions are suppressed since most atoms are fully ionized ( pavlov , shibanov & zavlin 1991 ; london et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "we do not consider the global problem of the thermal spectra from a bursting ns ( for a review see lewin , van paradijs & taam 1993 and references therein ) , but rather the simplified problem of line transport in the fe layer .",
    "the spectra from a bursting neutron star , whose opacity is scattering dominated , is expected to be non - planckian ( zeldovich & shakura 1969 ; castor 1974 ; madej 1974 ; van paradijs 1982 ) . for our purposes , we take the color correction given by madej , joss & rozanska ( 2004 ) ( also see madej 1991 ) to relate the observed color temperature to the effective temperature",
    ". the effect of the color correction is nearly offset by the measured redshift correction .",
    "hence the observed color temperature _ at infinity _ is roughly the effective temperature _ at the surface_. for the sake of simplicity , we approximate the continuum flux with a blackbody at the effective temperature . however , we will discuss the effect of the spectral shape of the continuum flux on our results in ",
    "[ sec : meat ] .",
    "we assume that the continuum is formed below the line forming region and is freely streaming .",
    "the equation of radiative transfer is then ( mihalas 1978 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the frequency and angle dependent specific intensity , @xmath24 is the angle - average mean intensity , @xmath25 is the planck function , @xmath26 is the line opacity properly normalized , @xmath27 is the absorbed fraction , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the line profile distribution and is determined by the physics of   [ sec : stark ] , and @xmath30 is the redistribution function .",
    "the coordinate @xmath31 measures the column from the base of the scattering layer",
    ".      we begin by discussing the line broadening physics .",
    "the number density of fully ionized h at the photosphere is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the surface gravity .",
    "it is sufficiently dense so that the intrinsic broadening of the hydrogenic fe h@xmath0 line is dominated by the linear stark effect ( paerels 1997 ) .",
    "the linear stark effect is only relevant for hydrogenic atoms and breaks down for multi - electron atoms where the degeneracies of opposite parity states are broken ( bethe & salpeter 1957 ) .",
    "the distribution of the electric microfields is given by the holtsmark distribution ( mihalas 1978 ; also see potekhin , chabrier , & gilles 2002 ) and the characteristic scale is given from interactions with neighboring protons , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mean ion spacing and @xmath36 is the density .",
    "hence the scale of stark broadening is @xmath37 for the h@xmath0 line , @xmath38 for the ly@xmath0 line , and @xmath39 for the p@xmath0 line , where @xmath40 .",
    "note that we have chosen the upper state because of the strong dependence on @xmath41 .",
    "the scale of thermal doppler broadening is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the line energy , scaled to the h@xmath0 transition and @xmath44 . for ly@xmath0 and p@xmath0 , @xmath45 ev and @xmath46 ev respectively .",
    "stark broadening dominates the h@xmath0 line and p@xmath0 , but thermal doppler broadening dominates the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "the relative strength of stark and thermal doppler broadening scales like @xmath47 where @xmath41 is the upper state and @xmath48 is the lower state .",
    "note the dependence on @xmath41 and @xmath48 . depending on the values of @xmath41 and @xmath48",
    ", the relative strengths of the two broadening mechanisms can vary tremendously .",
    "for instance for the h@xmath0 transition , @xmath49 , while for the ly@xmath0 and p@xmath0 transitions @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "the timescale of changes in electric microfields is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the thermal speed of the perturbing protons . at photospheric temperatures and densities ,",
    "this gives @xmath54 , much smaller than the @xmath55 radiative deexcitation timescale of @xmath56 .",
    "since the electric field changes during the time in which the atom absorbs and re - emits a photon , the energy of the two h@xmath0 photons are uncorrelated . with this in mind , we can assume _ complete redistribution _",
    ", greatly simplifying the line transport calculation .    the final broadening profile is a convolution of stark and thermal doppler broadening . in figure",
    "[ fig : distribution ] , we show these profiles for various values of @xmath57 .",
    "asymptotically , the distribution approaches the power law @xmath58 , expected for the holtsmark distribution ( mihalas 1978 ) . for @xmath59",
    ", we recover the thermal doppler profile . for @xmath60 , we approach the holtsmark distribution . note that for small values of @xmath57 , there is a severe deficit at zero shift because this shift corresponds to perfect symmetry in the proton distribution .",
    "in fact for @xmath61 , the probability of a zero shift goes precisely to zero .",
    "the effect of thermal doppler broadening is to fill in the distribution near zero ( see figure [ fig : distribution ] ) .",
    "the deficit near zero shift yields an emission - like feature there , which must be interpreted as reduced scattering .",
    "this is similar to the `` ghost of ly@xmath0 '' where reduced scattering in the line contributes to an emission - like feature in the spectra of broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars ( arav 1996 ) .",
    "we now show that the atomic level populations in the photospheres of bursting neutron stars are not expected to be in lte ( london et al .",
    "1986 , bcp ) . for simplicity",
    "we only consider a two - level system .",
    "the rate equations for the density of upper ( @xmath62 ) and lower ( @xmath63 ) states are then , @xmath64 - n_u\\left[c_{ul } + a_{ul } + b_{ul } j(e_{lu})\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath65 are the collisional rates from the lower to upper state and vice versa , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the einstein coefficients , @xmath68 is the energy of the transition and @xmath69 is the mean radiation intensity at that energy .",
    "we take the dipole approximation from jefferies ( 1962 ) for optically allowed transitions for the collisional rates : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the oscillator strength for the transition .",
    "putting this all together , we have @xmath72 for the @xmath73 transition and @xmath74 for the @xmath75 transition at @xmath76 .",
    "if we compare this to the radiative excitation / deexcitation rates in the same conditions , we find that @xmath77 for the @xmath78 transition and @xmath79 , easily exceeding the collisional rates for the @xmath80 transition at a radiation temperature of @xmath81 .    having radiative rates exceed collisional rates is not the only prerequisite to break lte .",
    "if the radiation field were isotropic and planckian , we would recover the boltzmann distribution for the level populations where the relevant temperature setting the level populations is that of the radiation .",
    "hence to break lte , we require the radiation field to be either non - planckian , anisotropic or both .",
    "this is indeed the case above the photosphere where the radiation field is free - streaming and the source function deviates from planckian due to the nature of scattering dominated atmospheres ( mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "therefore , to successfully model the spectral line formation , we must solve the equations of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium simultaneously .",
    "we rewrite equation ( [ eq : radiative_transfer ] ) by defining the flux @xmath82 and @xmath83 . integrating equation ( [ eq : radiative_transfer ] ) over @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    "we find ( mihalas 1978 ) , @xmath86 , \\\\ \\frac { \\partial k_{\\nu } } { \\partial \\tau_{\\nu } } & = & -f_{\\nu } , \\label{eq : radiative_transfer_split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . note that @xmath90 is defined from the base of the scattering layer . if we define the variable eddington factor as @xmath91 , we can write equation ( [ eq : radiative_transfer_split ] ) as @xmath92 . \\label{eq : radiative_transfer_var}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : radiative_transfer_var ] ) is a generalization of harrington s ( 1973 ) equation including the use of variable eddington factors .",
    "we solve equation ( [ eq : radiative_transfer_var ] ) with a standard methodology ( mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "following the nomenclature of mihalas ( 1978 ) we define a symmetric and antisymmetric average for the intensity @xmath93 \\\\",
    "v_{\\nu}(\\tau_{\\nu } , |\\mu| ) = \\frac 1 2 \\left[i_{\\nu}(\\tau_{\\nu } , |\\mu| ) - i_{\\nu}(\\tau_{\\nu } , -|\\mu|)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which combined with the equation of radiative transfer ( eq.[[eq : radiative_transfer ] ] ) yields @xmath94\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the source function . to solve this system of equations , we take an initial guess for the variable eddington factor , @xmath95 , and assume an initial input @xmath23 at the bottom of the scattering layer that is isotropic in the outward half space ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "we then solve for @xmath97 in equation ( [ eq : radiative_transfer_var ] ) .",
    "we compute @xmath98 given @xmath97 and solve for @xmath99 and @xmath100 in equation ( [ eq : uv ] ) . with @xmath99 and @xmath100 in hand , we compute , @xmath23 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , compute a new @xmath95 and iterate to convergence .",
    "since the atmosphere is in nlte and scattering dominated , we must simultaneously solve the equations of radiative transfer ( eq.[[eq : radiative_transfer ] ] ) and statistical equilibrium ( eq.[[eq : two - level ] ] ) .",
    "for simplicity , we assume a two - level atom and calculate the level populations between the two states ( in the case of h@xmath0 , the two states are the n=2 and n=3 states ; for ly@xmath0 , n=1 and n=2 ; for p@xmath0 , n=3 and n=4 ) fixing the sum of the two states .",
    "we iteratively solve the radiative transfer equation ( eq.[[eq : radiative_transfer ] ] ) and use the computed mean intensities to solve for statistical equilibrium ( eq.[[eq : two - level ] ] ) ; i.e. @xmath103 iteration .",
    "we define convergence when the mean intensity varied by less than @xmath104 , which was typically achieved in 3 - 5 iterations .",
    "we solve the thin scattering layer illustrated by figure [ fig : model ] with the above technique .",
    "however , before we continue , we review the analytic result of a specific case of scattering dominated atmosphere known as schuster s law ( schuster 1905 ) . assuming that line opacity is dominant ( @xmath105 ) , the absorbed fraction is small ( @xmath106 ) , and the scattering is coherent ( @xmath107 ) , equation ( [ eq : radiative_transfer_var ] ) becomes @xmath108 solving this equation , we find @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath25 are constants . from equation ( [ eq : radiative_transfer_split ] )",
    ", we also find @xmath111 .",
    "we now make some further approximations to determine @xmath110 and @xmath25 .",
    "we assume the eddington approximation everywhere so that @xmath112 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "we also assume the two stream approximation , which breaks the radiation field into one outgoing stream ( @xmath113 ) and one incoming stream ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "consistency with the eddington approximation demands @xmath115 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions are that the incoming flux at the surface is zero , @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the total optical depth of the scattering layer at frequency @xmath118 and that below the line forming region , the incident intensity is fixed at some value typical for type i bursts ( @xmath119 ) . per frequency",
    "the optical depth of the slab is given by @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the normalization of the optical depth and is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the cross section at line center .",
    "in the two - stream approximation , our definitions for the mean intensity and the flux become @xmath124 and hence solving for @xmath110 and @xmath25 , we find @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the transmitted intensity .",
    "equation ( [ eq : schuster ] ) is known as schuster s law .",
    "note that at large @xmath117 , the specific intensity scales with @xmath127 unlike the absorption dominated case where @xmath128 at large @xmath117 .",
    "this difference in scaling with optical depth between a scattering dominated atmosphere and an absorption dominated atmosphere is the key to understanding the nature of the fe h@xmath0 line .",
    "we compare the flux from our exact numerical calculations with schuster s law ( eq.[[eq : schuster ] ] ) in figure [ fig : coherent ] . for simplicity of the discussion ,",
    "we take a simple model of a hydrogenic atom whose energy levels are defined by @xmath129 , which gives the energy of the fe h@xmath0 transition of @xmath130 .",
    "we will consider the fully relativistic atom with the complications of fine structure splitting later .",
    "we take @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 for these models .",
    "our numerical calculation for coherent scattering in the two - stream approximation and schuster s law are indistinguishable and are both represented by the thin - solid line .",
    "this confirms the accuracy of our numerical treatment with the exact analytic result .",
    "the other calculations represent the full numerical solutions with _ complete redistribution _ with the variable eddington factor , @xmath95 , computed self - consistently .",
    "these curves are computed with 10 angular points , 100 frequency points and 100 depth points at various values of the absorption coefficient @xmath134 .",
    "the difference between the thick - solid line and the thin - solid line is due to differences between coherent scattering and complete redistribution and the nature of the two - stream approximation which fixes @xmath112 at every point compared to the full self - consistent calculation .",
    "note the emission - like feature at line center , which is due to the deficit near zero shift discussed in   [ sec : stark ] .",
    "now that we have established the effectiveness of our numerical code , we discuss the nature of the hydrogenic fe ly@xmath0 , h@xmath0 and p@xmath0 lines .",
    "since we have limited our study to two - level atomic systems , the relevant transitions starting from the 1s ground state are 1s @xmath135 2p , 2p @xmath135 3d and 3d @xmath135 4f .",
    "the fine structure splitting of these transitions significantly complicates the line structure . due to fine structure",

    "the ly@xmath0 1s @xmath135 2p transition is fine structure split into two lines with relative line intensities of 2:1 with energies of 6.9728 kev and 6.9521 kev , a difference of @xmath140 ev .",
    "the h@xmath0 2p @xmath135 3d transition is split into three lines with relative line intensities of 9:1:5 and energies of 1.2811 kev , 1.2790 kev , and 1.2997 kev .",
    "taking the energy of the strongest line to be the centroid , the splitting of the levels are 0 , -2.1 , 18.6 ev ( bethe & salpeter 1957 ) .",
    "the size of the splitting is comparable to the ew and the fwhm of the observed line .",
    "finally the p@xmath0 3d @xmath135 4f transition is split into three lines with intensities 20:1:14 and energy differences of 0 , -0.43 , 1.61 ev . these splittings are smaller than the effect of stark broadening , so that their effect on the line profile is small .",
    "we illustrate the line profile with fine structure splitting in figure [ fig : fine_structure ] .",
    "we also turn on statistical equilibrium so that from an initial state where the initial population of the two - level atom was assumed to be in the n=2 state ( with an optical depth normalization of @xmath131 ) , we simultaneously solve radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium .",
    "since the opacity is dominated by line itself , the absorbed fraction is determined from the ratio of the collisional rate to the total transition rates ( @xmath141 ) . in statistical equilibrium",
    ", @xmath134 relaxes to a small value of @xmath142 , typical of a scattering dominated atmosphere .",
    "this line profile represents the complete solution to the spectra from the resonant scattering layer .",
    "note that the triplet structure of the fine structure lines is reduced to a doublet because stark broadening is so large .",
    "the line s equivalent width ( ew ) is the proportional deficit and is defined as @xmath143 though rotation will modify the line profile , it conserves equivalent width ( gray 1992 ) to first order in @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the angular rotation rate . in figure",
    "[ fig : ew ] , we show the fractional equivalent width , defined as the equivalent width in wavelength units over the line center wavelength , as a function of the fe column in the @xmath146 state for @xmath147 ( dotted line ) and @xmath133 ( solid line ) , corresponding to the coulomb stopping density for radial infall and the @xmath148 surface ( approximating a solar metallicity atmosphere ) for a radiation temperature of @xmath132 .",
    "we also show the observed ew ( cpm ) .",
    "the scattering dominated calculations imply @xmath149 .",
    "we also plot an extremal grey atmosphere model in perfect lte ( @xmath150 ) for comparison .",
    "the lte calculation requires a much larger @xmath151 and highlights how poor the lte calculation fares compared to the full resonant calculation .",
    "we calculate a grid of models for the ly@xmath0 , h@xmath0 and p@xmath0 transitions to relate the equivalent widths and level populations in each transition to one another .",
    "we estimate the total @xmath152 to that in the n=1 state via saha equilibrium .",
    "since the radiation field drives ionization , we expect our results from saha equilibrium will give a _ lower _ bound on @xmath152 .",
    "we relate ew@xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath152 , ew@xmath155 and ew@xmath156 in figure [ fig : spectral ] at two different proton densities : @xmath157 ( fe stopping layer ; dotted line ) and @xmath133 ( solid line ) .",
    "the larger proton density is indicative of what would happen in a uniform metallicity atmosphere .",
    "the observed fe h@xmath0 ew gives an implied column of @xmath158 if all the fe is concentrated in the fe stopping layer .",
    "saha equilibrium then implies a total fe column of @xmath159 at the fe stopping layer , a factor of @xmath160 higher than the solar metallicity accretion / spallation scenario . for the larger proton density ( @xmath161 ) , the implied fe column is @xmath162 , a factor of two larger than that implied by a uniform solar metallicity photosphere .",
    "since ionization balance is likely given by the radiation field ( london et al .",
    "1986 ) , the _ true _",
    "@xmath152 is likely even higher for both these scenarios .",
    "we also estimate that our implied @xmath154 gives an ew@xmath163 ( redshifted 11 - 15 ev ) .",
    "though this is larger than ew@xmath164 , rotational broadening has a large impact on its detectability ( see   [ sec : rotation ] ) . for the p@xmath0 line , the ew@xmath165 ev ( redshifted 3 - 5 ev ) for the observed ew@xmath164 .",
    "we now take @xmath166 as a free parameter to understand how our results depend on the color correction and spectra .",

    "since we are interested in fe at the stopping column ( measured from the top of the atmosphere ) of @xmath167 ( thin lines ) , the local proton density , which is important for stark broadening , is then @xmath168 .",

    "we also plot a similar fe column at @xmath170 ( measured from the top of the atmosphere ) , which is more representative of a uniform atmosphere . from figure",
    "[ fig : spectral ] and [ fig : ktvsnfe ] , we find that our the implied fe column for a solar metallicity atmosphere is within a factor of 3 for the entire range of burst temperatures of 1 - 2 kev .",
    "we discuss these points further in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "rotational broadening heavily modifies the structure of the lines .",
    "we estimate its effects on the line profile as follows .",
    "since the photon occupation number @xmath171 is invariant under lorentz transformations , the effect of rotational broadening on the emergent ns flux is @xmath172 following various authors ( chandrasekhar 1945 ) , we ignore the effect of lorentz boosts on the angle and focus on the effects of the frequency shift .",
    "we are currently calculating the exact general relativistic calculation elsewhere ( morsink et al .",
    "2005 ; also see zel & psaltis 2003 and bhattacharyya , miller & lamb 2004 ) .",
    "in addition for narrow lines , @xmath173 , so we can ignore the effects of the @xmath174 in the denominator , leaving @xmath175 , \\cos\\theta\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] showing that rotational line broadening goes like @xmath176 .",
    "we plot the fe p@xmath0 , h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 lines for a 1.4@xmath177  ns with r=9 .",
    "2 km at various rotation rates up to 300 hz in figure [ fig : rotation ] . to ease comparison with observation , we plot the lines as a function of wavelength and include the redshift correction of @xmath178 .",
    "we also include the @xmath179 redshift correction to the rotation rate .",
    "for the highest rotation rates ( @xmath180 ) , the fe h@xmath0 central line depth would only be about 5 - 10% below the continuum and hence the line would be difficult to detect at the observed ew . at lower rotation rates the doublet nature of the line gives an asymmetric profile with a sharp feature . for the p@xmath0 line ,",
    "the fine structure splitting in the line is smaller than the stark effect so it appears as a singlet .",
    "rotational broadening is more pronounced on the ly@xmath0 transition , which has a fwhm @xmath181 at a spin frequency of @xmath182 hz .",
    "this is 5 times larger than the rotational fwhm for the h@xmath0 line due to the larger energy of the ly@xmath0 transition compared to the h@xmath0 transition . at the implied ew@xmath155 matched to the observed ew@xmath164 ,",
    "the line is extremely shallow with a central line depth of approximately 10% .",
    "hence even at this modest rotation rate , the ly@xmath0 line may be difficult to detect . for larger rotation rates ( @xmath183 hz )",
    ", ly@xmath0 is so distributed that it may be impossible to detect .",
    "observations of dips and eclipses on exo  0748 - 676 ( parmar et .",
    "1986 ) have revealed that the orbit of the secondary is nearly edge - on ( @xmath184 ) . assuming the rotation axis of the ns",

    "since the radiation force exceeds that of gravity , the fe will not necessarily sediment .",
    "rather , fe can be sustained in the atmosphere , allowing for a potential concentration .",
    "as the column of fe builds , more and more of the line flux is absorbed which decreases the radiative force .",
    "this continues until an equilibrium column is reached where enough of the line flux is absorbed that the fe feels the same net force as a background proton , so that both species have the same scale height ( chayer , fontaine & wesemael 1995 ) .",
    "this is achieved when the radiative force is equal to the effective force @xmath200m_pg$ ] , which takes into account the effects of both gravity and the electric field for a hydrogen atmosphere and assumes all the fe is hydrogenic ( vennes et al .",

    "following our previous discussion , we now equate the radiative force ( eq.[[eq : radiative_force ] ] ) to the effective force to find the equilibrium column . for simplicity ,",

    "the ratio between fully ionized fe and the n=1 hydrogenic state is 10 - 20 and @xmath229 , larger than a constant solar metallicity atmosphere @xmath230 ( bcp ) .",
    "these values are also tantalizingly close to what would be required to for the measured h@xmath0 line , but we note that the radiatively levitated fe column is sensitively dependent on the background continuum and surface gravity . since bursting ns atmospheres are expected to be harder than a blackbody as discussed earlier in ",
    "[ sec : model_atmosphere ] , we would expect these values to be lower limits .",
    "the associated ly@xmath0 ew for these fe columns in this approximation is 50 - 90 ev .",
    "other transitions also contribute to the radiative force on the fe column .",
    "we now show that their contributions are small compared to the ly@xmath0 radiative force .",
    "first , we consider the contribution from the h@xmath0 transition . for a boltzmann distribution between the n=1 and the n=2 state at @xmath231 ,",
    "the column density in the n=2 state is @xmath232 .",
    "the radiative force from the h@xmath0 transition is @xmath233 which is a factor of 5 smaller than the radiative force on the ly@xmath0 transition of @xmath234 .",
    "the contribution from the h@xmath0 transition increases the column by about a third , but we will ignore this contribution in keeping with the order of magnitude spirit of this calculation",
    ". other transitions also contribute , but their radiative forces are weaker as their fluxes are weaker by the rayleigh - jeans factor of @xmath235 compared to h@xmath0 .",
    "motivated by the accretion / spallation scenario that we first presented in bcp , we have calculated the resonant radiative transfer of a thin scattering layer above the ns photosphere .",
    "while our calculation and microphysics are geared toward understanding the feature as an fe h@xmath0 line , the basic physics would remain the same for other atomic transitions .",
    "namely , if the line is produced near the continuum photosphere where the densities are relatively high , stark broadening is dominant , nlte effects are prevalent and the line is a result of resonant scattering",
    ". applied to fe h@xmath0 , our calculations show that the ew of the fe h@xmath0 line observed by cpm from  requires an fe column 3 - 10 times larger than the accretion / spallation scenario predicts for accretion of solar metallicity material ( bcp ) .",
    "we also approximate a uniform solar metallicity atmosphere by assuming the fe sits at a larger depth . in this case",
    ", we find that the required column of fe is within a factor of 3 of a solar metallicity atmosphere over a large range of temperatures .",
    "the fact that the h@xmath0 line is narrow requires that the rotation rate of  is slow .",
    "larger spin rates , assuming a neutron star radius of around 10 km , would wash out such a line unless the surface emission is confined to a narrow region around the spin axis ( bhattacharyya , miller & lamb 2004 ) .",
    "a slow rotation rate for is consistent with the recently measured 44.7 hz burst oscillation ( villarreal & strohmayer 2004 ) . with these line profiles in hand and assuming that the burst oscillation of 44.7 hz is the rotation rate of the ns , detailed fits to the data raises the exciting prospect of fitting for the neutron star radius ( morsink et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "since the fine structure splitting of fe h@xmath0 is of order the size of the rotational broadening , we can not assume that the line is narrow compared to the rotational broadening .",
    "previous work ( zel & psaltis 2003 ; bhattacharyya , miller & lamb 2004 ) has presumed that the intrinsic line profile does not matter because rotational broadening is dominant . while true for ns rotating at 300 - 600 hz , it is not the case for a fe h@xmath0 line at 45 hz for a 10 km ns .",
    "rotational broadening may be the largest effect , but it is by no means the dominant effect .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic line profile must be known to apply the observed lines to the study of ns physics .",
    "we also estimated that the fe ew@xmath155 and ew@xmath236 are approximately 15 - 20 ev and 3 - 7 ev respectively at the observed ew@xmath164 .",
    "we can extend this calculation to include other n=1 and n=2 transitions aside from ly@xmath0 and h@xmath0 .",
    "however , because of the greatly reduced oscillator strengths , these lines are significantly weaker . for instance",
    ", we have modeled h@xmath237 ew to be @xmath238 2 ev .",
    "rotational broadening makes a huge impact on the observability of the fe ly@xmath0 transition .",
    "while the spectral resolution of chandra and astro e2 is more than adequate to detect such a line , the ly@xmath0 line will be shallow and difficult to detect .",
    "we expect rotational broadening to be a small effect for p@xmath0 , however , the redshifted energy of the p@xmath0 transition of 330 ev would make it difficult due to interstellar absorption .    in calculating these profiles of stark broadened lines , we have assumed a pure hydrogen atmosphere . however , the stark broadening scale given in equation ( [ eq : starkscale ] ) depends on the background composition .",
    "namely @xmath239 .",
    "for solar composition , @xmath240 is larger by 14% .",
    "this reduces the required @xmath241 needed to reproduced the observed ew by 10% . for a pure",
    "he atmosphere @xmath242 is larger by a factor of 2.42 , which reduces the required @xmath152 to reproduce the observed ew by 60% . for an atmosphere that consist of equal parts he and h by number",
    ", we find the required @xmath152 is reduced by about 50% .",
    "such he - rich atmosphere would demand accretion from a h - poor donor such as 4u 1820 - 30 , but the initial spallation would reduce the he fraction at the photosphere .",
    "the formation of the he - like fe spectral feature in the low - temperature part of the burst is an issue that warrants further study . in saha equilibrium ,",
    "h - like fe transitions to he - like fe at 1.2 kev ( cpm ) .",
    "we note however that the microphysics of this line is significantly different from the h@xmath0 line .",
    "its instrinsic broadening is due to thermal doppler effects because the lack of degenerate opposite parity states suppresses the linear stark effect ( bethe & salpeter 1957 ) .",
    "modeling this feature requires a separate calculation which is beyond the scope of this paper .    if accretion / spallation is indeed not the endpoint of accretion onto a neutron star , we expand on radiative levitation as a means to suspend the fe , which we first pointed out in bcp .",
    "we give a simple estimate for the fe column that could be suspended by radiative levitation .",
    "we find that radiative levitation could suspend a column of fe needed to produce the line .",
    "however , this result depends sensitively on the exact nature of the background spectra .",
    "further work will be necessary as the continuum spectra could be much harder than the blackbody background that we have assumed .",
    "though we assume solar metallicity throughout our calculations , the composition of the accreting material remains highly uncertain .",
    "if the metallicity of the flow is sufficiently supersolar , the disparity between the accretion / spallation fe column and that implied from observation can be resolved .",
    "however , the contrast between the deep dips and the unobscured state of  indicates that the metallicity may be subsolar by a factor of 2 - 7 ( parmar et al . 1986 ) .",
    "more recent work has found that the abundance ratios of mg , ne and o are consistent with solar with large uncertainties ( jimenez - garate , schulz & marshall 2003 ) .",
