    "pyrochlore oxides@xcite have attracted a great deal of recent attention as a consequence of their diverse , often unusual , physical properties .",
    "recent examples of the diverse properties displayed by pyrochlores include the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance in tl@xmath3mo@xmath3o@xmath2 in the absence of multiple valence states,@xcite superconductivity in cd@xmath3re@xmath3o@xmath2,@xcite and in the @xmath7-pyrochlore kos@xmath3o@xmath6,@xcite and an unusual chiral magnetic ground state in nd@xmath3mo@xmath3o@xmath2.@xcite    in the pyrochlore crystal structure , originally associated with the mineral ca@xmath3nb@xmath3o@xmath6f , the b ( nb ) atoms form a network of corner - sharing octahedra .",
    "the a - site ( ca ) has six o neighbors and two f neighbors . for the purpose of this work on oxide pyrochlores ,",
    "the structure is best described as a@xmath3b@xmath3o@xmath6o@xmath8 comprising two interpenetrating sublattices with the formul a@xmath3o@xmath8 and bo@xmath6 .",
    "these views of the structure are displayed in figure.1 .",
    "the crystal chemical principles involved in the pyrochlore structure are unusual as has recently been emphasized by vanderah and coworkers.@xcite for example , the a@xmath3o@xmath8 sublattice can tolerate a great deal of displacive disorder , and consequently , does not obey the usual rules for cation substitution .",
    "these unusual principles play a significant rle in rendering the pyrochlore structure suitable for the storage of ions involved in radioactive waste.@xcite    another crucial feature of the structure is that when regarded separately , both the a and b sublattices form corner - connected networks of a@xmath9 and b@xmath9 tetrahedra .",
    "the formation of such tetrahedral networks can result in magnetic frustration associated , for example , with the infeasibility of decorating the vertices of a tetrahedron with all four spins in an anti - parallel configuration.@xcite p. w. anderson@xcite first recognized the relation between the tetrahedral spin configurations of spinels and the problem of the crystal structure of ice-@xmath10 . according to the bernal - fowler rules@xcite each oxygen atom in the ice lattice",
    "is tetrahedrally bonded to four protons , with the proviso that two of the protons are proximal ( covalent ) and two are distal ( h - bonded ) .",
    "there is no unique arrangement which satisfies these rules , and as a consequence , ice-@xmath10 has a residual zero - temperature entropy.@xcite the crystal structure of ice-@xmath10 is therefore frustrated in the sense that it can not find a perfectly crystalline zero - entropy ground state .",
    "there is great current interest in such frustrated systems , associated with a desire to understand the nature of complex potential energy landscapes , and a number of recent studies have emerged on `` spin - ice '' pyrochlores.@xcite interestingly , when ground state structures are induced , for example through oh@xmath11 doping , polar ground states become possible in water ice.@xcite    unlike abo@xmath12 perovskite oxides where ferroelectricity is not uncommon and is a well - studied phenomenon,@xcite there exist very few ferroelectric pyrochlores .",
    "the few known system seem to be based on cd@xmath3nb@xmath3o@xmath2,@xcite and its variants.@xcite these compounds remain the subject of study.@xcite `` high-@xmath13 '' pyrochlore oxides with large dielectric constants exemplified by ( bi@xmath0zn@xmath1)(nb@xmath0zn@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( bzn ) however do exist and are attracting considerable attention .",
    "bzn is a cubic pyrochlore at all temperatures,@xcite with considerable short - range order in the structure.@xcite ceramic samples are known to combine high dielectric constants with low dielectric losses.@xcite a combination of spectroscopic techniques reveal that the unusual properties of bzn arise due to local hopping of the bi and o@xmath14 atoms among several potential minima.@xcite interestingly , from the viewpoint of applications , these desirable characteristics are retained in thin films.@xcite    it is intriguing that bzn exhibits all the characteristics of a compound _ about _ to undergo a phase transition , such as the need to split the bi and o@xmath14 for satisfactory rietveld refinements of neutron diffraction data,@xcite and yet remains cubic till the lowest temperature .",
    "the absence of a phase transition is an important ingredient in the usefulness of bzn .",
    "for example , in a material with no phase transition , there is little fatigue , and the temperature coefficient of the dielectric constant is small .",
    "the preparation of a slightly off - stoichiometric pyrochlore phase related to bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 by sleight and coworkers , @xcite and the more recent preparation of stoichiometric , cubic bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 by hector and wiggin@xcite provide a good model system for understanding polar phenomena in the bismuth pyrochlores .",
    "stoichiometric bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 has been prepared by a low - temperature route and established by powder neutron diffraction to be a cubic pyrochlore down to 2 k , but with extensive site disorder at both the bi and o@xmath14 sites.@xcite site disorder on the pyrochlore a - site is well - known for lone pair active cations such as tl@xmath15,@xcite sn@xmath16,@xcite and bi@xmath5@xcite and will be discussed in further detail .",
    "we have for some time been interested in the stereochemistry of lone pairs in extended solids,@xcite and have used density functional calculations of electronic structure in conjunction with the electron localization function@xcite for visualizing lone pair electrons in the real space of crystal structures .",
    "here such analysis is extended to the electronic structure of cubic bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 . for comparison ,",
    "lmto calculations have been performed on the aurivillius phase ferroelectric srbi@xmath3ta@xmath3o@xmath4@xcite where the transition from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric phase at 608 k is driven in large part by the off - centering tendency of the bi@xmath5 ions .",
    "the electronic structures of paraelectric@xcite and ferroelectric srbi@xmath3ta@xmath3o@xmath4@xcite have been described previously , but no discussion of the disposition of lone pairs in the ferroelectric phase has been presented .",
    "the disposition of pb@xmath16 lone pairs in the cubic defect pyrochlore pb@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath6@xcite are also examined .",
    "linear muffin - tin orbital calculations@xcite on pyrochlore bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 were performed within the atomic sphere approximation using version 47c of the stuttgart tb - lmto - asa program.@xcite scalar - relativistic kohn - sham equations within the local density approximation @xcite were solved taking all relativistic effects into account except for the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the calculations were performed on 72 irreducible @xmath13 points within the primitive wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "lmto electronic structures were analyzed by calculating crystal orbital hamiltonian populations ( cohps ) and electron localization functions ( elfs ) .",
    "the crystal orbital hamiltonian population cohp@xcite is a tool which permits energy - resolved analysis of bonding , the elf provides a measure of the local influence of the pauli repulsion on the behavior of electrons and permits the mapping in real space of core , bonding , and non - bonding regions in a crystal.@xcite calculations were performed on the ideal crystal structure of pyrochlore bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2@xcite ( space group @xmath17 , @xmath18 = 10.37949 ) , displayed in figure1 .",
    "the atom positions are bi ( 0,0,0 ) , ti ( @xmath19,@xmath19,@xmath19 ) , o ( @xmath20,@xmath20,@xmath21 ) and o@xmath14 ( @xmath20,@xmath20,@xmath20 ) .",

    "the crystal structure of the defect pyrochlore pb@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath6@xcite is reported in the international crystal structure database ( entry 15308 ) to be a cubic pyrochlore with @xmath18 = 10.719 .",
    "atoms are pb ( 0,0,0 ) , sn ( @xmath19,@xmath19,@xmath19 ) , and o ( @xmath20,@xmath20,@xmath21 ) with @xmath21 = 0.4250 .",
    "o@xmath14 is missing in this structure .",
    "lmto calculations on pb@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath6 employed a grid of 72 irreducible @xmath13 points .",
    "the bi@xmath3o@xmath14 network of bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 can be imagined as being formed of a diamond lattice of o@xmath14 , with one bi atom at the center of every o@xmath14-o@xmath14 linkage .",
    "the bi@xmath3o@xmath14 network thus satisfies one of the bernal - fowler rules@xcite in that each o@xmath14 is tetrahedrally surrounded by bi .",
    "the network does not satisfy the `` two - near and two - far '' rule , meaning that ideal pyrochlore bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 is perfectly crystalline and has no residual entropy .",
    "the projected bi and oxygen lmto densities of state ( dos ) , and the bi - oxygen cohps of cubic bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 are displayed in the three panels of figure2 .",
    "the band gap in cubic bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 is about 2 ev .",
    "bi @xmath23 states in figure  2(a ) are seen to reside in a very narrow window of energy around -10 ev with respect to the top of the valence band ( set as the origin of the energy axis in this and other plots ) .",
    "bi @xmath24 states , as expected for a formally bi@xmath5 system , are largely empty and form the conduction band which starts at 2 ev .",
    "some bi @xmath24 states are found mixed with the valence band as a result of covalency with oxygen .",
    "bi @xmath23 and @xmath24 states of bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 are resemble those previously observed in cubic `` pre - distorted '' bimno@xmath12.@xcite o @xmath24 and o@xmath14 @xmath24 states are displayed in figure2(b ) .",
    "there are six o for every one o@xmath14 , giving rise to a large difference in the relative number of states .",
    "o@xmath14 states are particularly prominent around -5.5 ev , near the bottom of the valence band , where o@xmath14 @xmath24 forms band with bi @xmath24 states .",
    "bi - o and bi - o@xmath14 cohps are displayed per primitive unit cell ( or for a single bio@xmath6o@xmath25 polyhedron ) in figure2(c ) .",
    "the integrated cohp which is indicative of the strength of interaction , confirms that bi @xmath23 states are quite inert in the cubic crystal structure .",
    "stronger bi @xmath24 and o@xmath14 @xmath24 interactions manifest as a large bonding cohp at the bottom of the valence band . because of the longer distance between bi and o ( 2.635 ) compared with bi and o@xmath14 ( 2.247 ) , the bi - o interaction is weak and o obtain most of their bond valence from ti .",
    "the valence electron localization function ( elf ) of bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 is plotted within the real space of the crystal structure in figure3 . for clarity , ti and o atoms",
    "are not displayed .",
    "bi and o@xmath14 are connected to emphasize the `` interrupted '' diamond lattice .",
    "isosurfaces of the elf for a value of 0.65 manifest the lobes of @xmath23 electrons around bi .",
    "these lobes are constrained by the symmetry of the structure to form cylindrical objects with the cylindrical axis along different [ 111 ] directions , corresponding to the bi - o@xmath14 bonds .",
    "the elf is also displayed on the back plane of the crystal structure as a map running from deep blue ( poorly localized regions ) to white ( strongly localized regions ) .",
    "the particular manner in which the lone pairs localize around bi atoms is an artifact of the ideal crystal structure is used here . in reality , both bi and o@xmath14 are shifted from their crystallographic sites,@xcite albeit in a incoherent manner . to understand what the lone pair localization should more properly resemble ,",
    "the disposition of lone pairs in the aurivillius phase ferroelectric srbi@xmath3ta@xmath3o@xmath4 is examined in the following subsection .",
    "the @xmath22 crystal structure of srbi@xmath3ta@xmath3o@xmath4@xcite is displayed in figure4 and comprises alternate stacks of double - perovskite [ srta@xmath3o@xmath2]@xmath27 slabs interleaved with [ bi@xmath3o@xmath3]@xmath16 slabs .",
    "the latter are reminiscent of the bi - o sublattice of biof@xcite where bi lone pairs organize themselves in an antiferrodistortive manner , akin to what is seen in pbo.@xcite in this _ distorted _ crystal structure , bi @xmath23 states [ figure5(a ) ] are significantly more disperse than was observed for cubic bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 .",
    "relatively few bi @xmath24 states are observed in the region of filled o @xmath24 states [ figure5(b ) ] ; most bi @xmath24 states are empty and , starting at 2 ev , form the conduction band along with empty ta @xmath29 states ( not displayed ) .",
    "the bi - o cohp displays quite strong bonding in the region of bi @xmath23 states .",
    "both bi @xmath23 states and o @xmath24 states are filled , so their interaction gives rise to filled bonding states around -9 ev and filled antibonding states just below the top of the valence band .",
    "the intermediation of empty bi @xmath24 states provides net stabilization.@xcite the bi - o cohp of srbi@xmath3ta@xmath3o@xmath4 displayed in figure5(c ) is what the bi - o cohp of bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 displayed in figure  2(a ) would resemble were it permitted to take on an appropriately distorted coordination .    the valence elf of srbi@xmath3ta@xmath3o@xmath4 is displayed in the different panels of figure6 .",
    "the left panel of figure6 displays the elf isosurface within the space of the unit cell . for clarity , other atoms than in the bi - o network",
    "have been let out of the depiction .",
    "the net `` polarization '' of the lone pair lobes is more clearly seen in projections down the @xmath30 axis [ figure6(a - d ) ] .",
    "the elf was been calculated on a 48@xmath3148@xmath31144 ( @xmath32 ) real - space grid within the unit cell .",
    "figure6(a - d ) shows four sections of the elf at four different heights along the @xmath30 direction , corresponding to positions of bi atoms in the unit cell .",
    "in this view , it is clear that all the bi lone pairs have a component that points in the @xmath18 direction , meaning that the bi are shifted slightly along @xmath33 .",
    "it is this in - plane shift which gives srbi@xmath3ta@xmath3o@xmath4 its polarization .",
    "the very different shapes of the lone pair lobes associated with centered bi in bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 ( figure3 ) and with off - centered bi in srbi@xmath3ta@xmath3o@xmath4 ( figure6 ) should be noted .",
    "morgenstern - badarau and michel@xcite have reported the defect pyrochlore crystal structure of `` pb@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath34(h@xmath3o ) '' .",
    "interestingly , the compound has long history and could be one of the components of a yellow pigment used by renaissance painters called lead - tin yellow.@xcite the o@xmath14 atom is missing in this crystal structure and is replaced by a vacancy ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "a@xmath3o@xmath14 in the usual pyrochlore then corresponds to pb@xmath3@xmath35 .",
    "it is natural to assume that pb@xmath16 lone pairs would occupy the site that is normally taken up by o@xmath14 .",
    "this would parallel the crystal - chemical relation between litharge pbo and pbo@xmath3 ; the former having lone pairs in the place of the oxygen atoms of the latter.@xcite however the a@xmath3o@xmath14 network of the pyrochlore lattice depicted in figure1 allows us to recognize that for every four pb atoms , there are two sites into which the lone pairs can localize .",
    "the problem now maps precisely on to the bernal - fowler rules with the lone pair - pb connection corresponding to the short ( covalent ) o - h interaction .",
    "the valence elf of cubic pb@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath6 displayed in figure7 support this argument .",
    "the symmetry of the crystal structure prevents localization into a single lobe , and instead , a bi - lobed lone pair is obtained .",
    "topological frustration again prevents coherent ordering of the lone pairs in some distorted low - temperature structure .",
    "re - examination of the crystal structure of defect pyrochlore pb@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath6 should reveal disordering on this site ; splitting every pb atom into two along the @xmath35-pb-@xmath35 direction ( the [ 111 ] directions ) .",
    "the precise nature of such splitting would therefore be distinct from what is observed for bi in bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 where it is forms an annulus around o@xmath14-bi - o@xmath14.@xcite",
    "to aid the rest of the discussion , the panels of figure8 display two different views of the o@xmath14-centered tetrahedral network , also referred to as the tridimyte sublattice,@xcite of the pyrochlore structure .",
    "the two views suggest that we could view the pyrochlore structure as a stellation followed by stacking of _ kagom _ lattices of a atoms .",
    "a _ kagom _",
    "lattice is a lattice of corner sharing triangles .",
    "the stellation of this lattice is achieved by making each triangle a tetrahedron by alternately capping the triangles above and below the planes they are in and creating tetrahedra pointing either up or down ( along [ 111 ] in the pyrochlore structure ) . in 2d",
    "the pyrochlore lattice should be well - represented by a _",
    "kagom _ lattice .",
    "this allows us to compare in a simple manner , the topologies of perovskites , which we represent by a square lattice , and the pyrochlore , which we represent using the _ kagom _ lattice ( figure9 ) .",
    "a square lattice is easily distorted to a rectangular lattice [ figure9(a ) and ( b ) ] allowing _ coherent _ localization of lone pair lobes , which we indicate with arrows .",
    "this simple description is reasonably accurate in describing the pyroelectric to ferroelectric ( cubic @xmath36 to tetragonal @xmath37 ) phase transition in perovskite pbtio@xmath12.@xcite    a _ kagom _ lattice with lone pair - active ions at its corners [ figure9(a ) ] could localize lone pairs in two different ways : the first is for the lone pairs to localize perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the triangles , as depicted in figure9(c ) .",
    "this is the case with the annular lone - pair localization in bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 .",
    "the second is for the lone pairs to localize towards the centers of triangles , as depicted in figure9(d ) .",
    "this is representative of _ kagom _ spin ice@xcite and is similar to what is observed pb@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath6 . in neither case",
    "is it a simple matter to arrange the arrows such that a unit cell is obtained . note that neither of these arrangements would be _ ferrodistortive_. in fact , while we have focused on the paucity of ferroelectric pyrochlores , our analysis actually refers to any symmetry lowering phase transition .    in the rare instances when pyrochlore oxides distort as a result of coherent ordering of stereochemically active lone pairs",
    ", the resulting crystal structures can be be quite complex , for example , as determined recently for bi@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath2.@xcite however , retention of the cubic structure is important for properties .",
    "for instance , the pyrochlore composition bi@xmath3zn@xmath38nb@xmath39o@xmath2 crystallizes in a monoclinic structure related to zirconolite,@xcite and the material is not as interesting as ( bi@xmath0zn@xmath1)(nb@xmath0zn@xmath1)o@xmath2 for high-@xmath13 applications .",
    "wang _ _ et al.__@xcite have presented a simple and powerful argument for when a@xmath3b@xmath3o@xmath2 pyrochlores with lone pair active a cations distort .",
    "they point to a relative competition between covalency in the a - o and b - o networks . pyrochlores with strongly covalent b - o networks tend to retain the cubic structures .",
    "the arguments presented here bear close similarities to the frustration of soft modes in zrw@xmath3o@xmath40 , proposed by ramirez and coworkers@xcite as being responsible for its negative thermal expansion behavior.@xcite recently , loidl and coworkers@xcite reported unusual magnetoferroelectric properties of spinel cdcr@xmath3s@xmath9 . in this compound",
    ", relaxor ferroelectricity is observed in the absence of any substitutional disorder .",
    "the authors suggest that the origin of such relaxor behavior could be the topological frustration of a true ferroelectric ground state . in the superconducting @xmath7-pyrochlore oxides , kune , jeong , and pickett@xcite",
    "have used first principles calculations to determine that local displacements of the a cation are critical in determining superconducting @xmath41s .",
    "one could argue that in the absence of the topological frustration provided by the pyrochlore lattice , these local displacements would lead to a distorted ground state structure . in a related vein , for macroscopic materials built up from bars and pins ,",
    "the unusual properties of _ kagom _ lattices with respect to the applications of stresses have already been noted.@xcite    to summarize , it is proposed that in pyrochlores such as ( bi@xmath0zn@xmath1)(nb@xmath0zn@xmath1)o@xmath2 , properties are dominated by topological frustration rather than cation site disorder .",
    "bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 itself is therefore a candidate for high-@xmath13 behavior , and should be regarded as a parallel of systems such as cubic , _ predistorted _ pbtio@xmath12 . in relaxor ferroelectrics ,",
    "substitutional disorder frustrates long - range ordering and gives rise to unusual behavior , such as broad dielectric anomalies as a function of temperature.@xcite if relaxor ferroelectrics with site disorder are the ferroelectric equivalent of substitutional spin glasses such as cu : mn , then pyrochlore dielectrics could be considered the ferroelectric analogues of topologically frustrated magnets . in analogy with topologically frustrated magnets ,",
    "the recording of low - temperature heat capacity of bi@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath2 should permit the residual entropy to be measured and compared with values found in pyrochlore spin - ice.@xcite finally , in analogy with spin - ice , it is proposed that the term `` charge - ice '' is used to describe frustrated pyroelectric phenomena in systems such as spinels and pyrochlores .",
    "topological frustration in polar materials could constitute a powerful design parameter for useful and novel materials properties .",
