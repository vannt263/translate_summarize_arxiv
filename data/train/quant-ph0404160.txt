    "cooling and trapping techniques have improved dramatically over the last few decades . a very efficient method to transfer , for example ,",
    "a single atom rapidly to a very low temperature is sideband cooling @xcite .",
    "this requires a red - detuned laser field whose detuning equals the frequency of the vibrational mode of the atom .",
    "when the laser excites the system from the ground to an excited state , the vibrational energy reduces by one phonon .",
    "afterwards , the atom most likely returns into the ground state via spontaneous emission of a photon and without regaining energy in the vibrational mode .",
    "the corresponding non - unitary evolution effectively reduces the temperature of the atom and yields an overall decrease of the von neumann entropy in the system @xcite .",
    "other experiments aim at cooling molecules , which have a much richer inner level structure and are therefore harder to control than atoms .    here",
    "we apply the idea of side band cooling to a large number of particles ( atoms , ions or molecules ) . as in the one - atom case",
    ", a red - detuned laser field excites the particles , thereby continuously reducing the number of phonons in the system . to return the particles into their ground state",
    ", they should couple to the quantized field of a leaky optical cavity , whose frequency @xmath3 equals the dipole transition frequency @xmath4 of each particle ( see figure [ setup](a ) ) .",
    "once the particles transferred their excitation into the resonator mode , it leaks out through the cavity mirrors . using cavity decay , instead of spontaneous emission from excited levels , helps to avoid heating due to rescattering of photons within the sample .",
    "it also minimises spontaneous emission into unwanted states and allows to control even complicated level structures , like molecules .",
    "crucial for obtaining maximum cooling is the generation of _ cooperative _ behavior of the @xmath0 particles in the excitation step as well as in the de - excitation step .",
    "this is possible when the rabi frequency @xmath5 of the laser field for the cooling of a vibrational mode with frequency @xmath6 is for all particles the same and all particles see the same cavity coupling @xmath7 ( small variations of @xmath7 and @xmath5 and non - ideal initial conditions do not substantially affect our conclusions and will be considered elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "realising this inside an optical resonator requires self - organization of the particles in the antinodes of the cavity field , as predicted in ref .  @xcite",
    ". if the dipole moments of the atoms are in the average parallel to the cavity mirrors , the rabi frequencies @xmath5 are practically and to a good approximation for all particles the same , if the laser field enters the cavity from the side as shown in figure [ setup](b ) .",
    "the laser could also enter the cavity through one of the cavity mirrors , as it was the case in the many - atom cavity qed experiment in grangier s group in 1997 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a ring resonator can be employed , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , if a laser field with @xmath8 enters the resonator in a certain angle of the particles in the respective positions .",
    "the same applies for the phase factors of the laser amplitudes , which are now exactly the same as the phase factors of the cavity field term . ]",
    "@xmath9 with @xmath10 ( see figure [ setup](c ) ) .",
    "we also require that the particles are initially all prepared in their ground state ( in the large @xmath0 limit fluctuations can be neglected ) .",
    "then the time evolution of the system remains restricted within a dicke - symmetric subspace of collective states @xcite .",
    "as shown below , these states experience a very strong coupling to the laser field as well as to the cavity mode and the system evolves into a stationary state with no phonons on the time scale given by the cavity photon life time .",
    "several schemes for the cooling of atomic ensembles have been proposed @xcite and first cavity - cooling experiments have already been performed @xcite . compared to these , the scheme we propose provides a significant speed - up of the cooling process if operated in a regime with @xmath11 here @xmath1 denotes the cavity photon decay rate , @xmath12 is the spontaneous decay rate of a particle in the excited state and @xmath13 is the lamb - dicke parameter characterizing the steepness of the trap . for sufficiently large @xmath0 , condition ( [ reg ] ) can be fulfilled even if @xmath14 and the system is operated in the bad cavity limit with @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , we remark that eq .",
    "( [ reg ] ) describes a _ strong damping regime _ in which the system can only accumulate a small amount of population in the excited states of the particles .",
    "the proposed cooling scheme can be used to cool a large number of particles very efficiently .",
    "it is therefore an interesting question , whether the described setup might be used for the preparation of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "currently , these experiments mainly use evaporative cooling @xcite which systematically removes those atoms with a relatively high temperature from the trap .",
    "consequently , only a small percentage of the initially trapped atoms is finally included in the condensate . if one could instead cool all the atoms efficiently , yet at the same time avoid the loss of particles , it should become easier to experiment with large condensates . besides , cooling is also crucial for ion trap quantum computing where the achievable gate operation times can depend primarily on the efficiency of the cooling of a common vibrational mode @xcite .",
    "the concrete form of eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) suggests that the stationary state @xmath60 corresponds to a coherent state of the form @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , the only solution of @xmath64 is the state @xmath65 with all particles in the ground state , no photons in the cavity and no phonons in the common vibrational mode .",
    "once the atoms have been initialised , the system loses its phonons within the time it takes to reach the stationary state .",
    "since this time evolution is solely governed by the frequencies @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath1 , we expect that this happens in the large @xmath0 limit in a time given by the smallest of these frequencies .    to calculate the cooling rate explicitly , we derive a set of differential equations for the variables @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mean number of phonons with respect to the phonon number operator @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the mean number of photons in the cavity mode and @xmath72 relates to the mean number of particles in the excited state @xmath30 .",
    "it is also useful to consider the coherence quantities @xmath73 the introduction of ( [ coop2 ] ) is motivated by the fact that the system first builds up the coherences @xmath74 , which , once established , provide an effective coupling between the different subsystems . using eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) we obtain @xmath75 the annihilation and creation of phonons and photons is accompanied by changes of the excitation number of the single particles . for @xmath57 ,",
    "these fluctuations remains negligible on average and the approximations @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be adopted .",
    "we also neglect contributions of order one compared to @xmath0 such as @xmath79 . then @xmath80 these non - linear differential equations imply @xmath81 we see below , that the presence of a negative @xmath82 and a positive @xmath71 provides a cooling channel and plays a crucial role in the cooling process .    here",
    "we are interested in the cooling of a large number of particles .",
    "this allows us to solve the time evolution considering first the regime where @xmath83 and eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) becomes the conservation law @xmath84 in the parameter regime ( [ reg ] ) and given that @xmath69 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are of order @xmath0 , the system reaches a stationary state with @xmath69 , @xmath71 and @xmath82 constant on a time scale of the order @xmath85 .",
    "after such a time we might safely assume @xmath86 , and obtain from eq .",
    "( [ dgl2 ] ) and for @xmath83 that @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this stationary state is actually reached in a time given by the smallest among @xmath90 and @xmath91 , while @xmath83 controls longer - lived processes such as the one described by eq .",
    "( [ sol ] ) . under the above assumption for the zeroth order in @xmath1",
    ", we find @xmath92   \\",
    ", \\kappa m$ ] to the first order in @xmath1 . from this",
    "we get @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the initial number of phonons in the system with respect to the above defined operator @xmath70 .",
    "the exponential decrease of the phonon population ( see figure [ num](a ) ) amounts to the overall system cooling with a rate of the same order of magnitude as @xmath1 .",
    "the result ( [ m ] ) , which , we stress , holds under the condition of large @xmath0 , shows that the cooling of the system does not depend on the specific value of @xmath0 , and thus , provided @xmath0 is large , it holds even in the case that not all the particles are initially prepared in their ground state , which helps the feasibility of the scheme .",
    "we also remark that such a behavior becomes possible only because of dissipation , namely the leakage of photons through the cavity mirrors .",
    "the collective regime established above may also be obtained in the case where each particle @xmath95 couples to its _ own set _ of individual phonon modes @xmath96 . as above",
    ", we assume that the rabi frequencies @xmath5 of the corresponding laser fields with detuning @xmath6 are for all particles the same .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the system equals in the interaction picture @xmath97 with the notation @xmath98 where the @xmath99 obey  the relation @xmath100=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , eq .",
    "( [ hi20 ] ) simplifies to @xmath101 suppose that the system is initially prepared in a state with all particles in the ground state , the mean phonon number is the same for all particles and of about the same size as @xmath94 considered before and there are no photons in the cavity mode",
    ". then the operator @xmath102 has a similar effect on the system state as the operator @xmath103 in the previous case @xcite .",
    "the net result is shown to be again collective cooling in the large @xmath0 limit .    proceeding as before , we first calculate the stationary state @xmath60 .",
    "leakage of photons through the cavity mirrors is accounted for by using eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) . as before ,",
    "the form of the eqs .",
    "( [ master ] ) and ( [ hi2 ] ) suggests that @xmath104 is the state with all particles in the ground state and no phonons and no photons in the cavity .",
    "indeed , it obeys @xmath105 .    to calculate the cooling rate explicitly",
    ", we consider the expectation values @xmath106 and the coherences @xmath107 where we sum over all particles .",
    "( [ master ] ) with the hamiltonian ( [ hi2 ] ) and the same approximations as before , we obtain @xmath108 and @xmath109 implying @xmath110 the differential equations ( [ dgl1_indi ] ) and ( [ dgl1_indi2 ] ) reveal that , for @xmath83 , the system reaches a stationary state within a time of the order one with @xmath111 and @xmath112 , given @xmath113 is of order @xmath0 , while the cavity accumulates a small population of photons . however , @xmath114 remains small and the coherence @xmath115 provides the main decay channel for the phonons in the system . from eq .",
    "( [ sol_indi ] ) we obtain for large @xmath0 , in analogy to eq .  ( [ m ] ) , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the initial total phonon number .",
    "thus , similar to the result ( [ m ] ) , the rate for the cooling of individual phonon modes is of the same order of magnitude as the cavity decay rate @xmath1 , after a transition time given by the smallest among @xmath7 and @xmath118 ( see figure [ num](b ) ) .",
    "in this paper we propose a new cooling mechanism based on the collective excitation and de - excitation of particles trapped inside an optical cavity . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we showed that a large atomic sample in the presence of highy symmetric interactions , that treat all particles in the same way , behaves like a collection of bosonic particles . in sections",
    "[ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , we then analysed the two extreme cases , where the applied laser fields aim either at the cooling of only common or individual motions of the particles . for both cases",
    ", we predict cooling rates of the same order of magnitude as the cavity decay rate @xmath1 . in the general case",
    ", one might argue that the number of vibrational modes is extremely large .",
    "however , we believe that similar cooling rates would be achievable in this case as well , as long as the initial phonon energy in the setup does not increase with the number of particles @xmath0 in the setup , which is in general not the case .    we conclude with a few comments .",
    "the conservation law ( [ sol ] ) obtained for @xmath119 allows to define the conserved quantity @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "the meaning of the time independence of @xmath122 is that one can shift the quantities @xmath82 , @xmath69 and @xmath71 by some constants without changing the dynamics of the system apart from the changes in the process of redistributing phonons , governed by @xmath123 , and their population @xmath69 .",
    "the leakage of photons through the cavity mirrors ( @xmath124 ) disturbs the equilibrium expressed by @xmath125 inducing a dynamical response , i.e.  a quantum phase transition : the overall effect is the exponential decrease in the phonon population , namely cooling @xcite .",
    "the treatment in this paper should be compared with the traditional approach where the attention is focused on the single particle behavior .",
    "in such a single particle treatment @xcite the cooling depends exponentially on the cavity decay rate @xmath1 . in this case , @xmath1 has to be about the same size as @xmath7 and @xmath126 , which imposes a strong constraint on the time scale of the cooling process .",
    "the advantage of our treatment lies , on the contrary , in the fact that the numbers of particles @xmath0 introduces , in principle , the crucial freedom to tune @xmath1 to be as large as @xmath90 and @xmath127 thus cooling the particles very efficiently .",
    "although corrections might be necessary in realistic situations , a high cooling rate also reduces the number of collisions between particles , which certainly are a problem in less effective cooling schemes .",
    "we believe that considering the cavity - mediated collective field theoretical behavior opens a new perspective in particle cooling . + _ acknowledgement_. this work was supported in part by the european union , coslab ( esf program ) , infn , infm and the uk engineering and physical sciences research council . a.b . acknowledges stimulating discussion with philippe grangier and thanks the royal society and the gchq for funding as a james ellis university research fellow .",
