    "in geometric optimization , the goal is often to find an optimal object or optimal placement of an object subject to a number of geometric constraints ( see  @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "examples include finding the smallest circle enclosing a point set  @xcite or finding the smallest circle enclosing at least @xmath5 points of a point set of @xmath1 points ( @xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "in our setting , we study the following problem : given a set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points in the plane , find all the triangles of minimum area with a fixed angle @xmath3 , @xmath2 , that enclose @xmath0 . when no constraint is put on the angles , klee and laskowski  @xcite gave an @xmath7 time algorithm for finding the minimum area enclosing triangle .",
    "this was later improved to @xmath8 by orourke et al .",
    "@xcite which is optimal .",
    "bose et al .",
    "@xcite provided optimal algorithms for the setting where one wishes to find the minimum area isosceles triangles .",
    "the setting we explore here is in between the two .",
    "we place a restriction on the angle but do not insist on the triangle to be isosceles .",
    "our solution , which we outline below , uses ideas from the solutions of klee and laskowski and bose et al .",
    "the five main steps of the algorithm are presented in sections  [ section overview preliminaries ] , [ section optimal solution given omega wedge ] , [ section walking around omega cloud ] , [ section optimal solution apex on circular arc ] and [ section putting all together ] .",
    "each section outlines one step , proves the mathematical formulas involved and gives its time complexity .",
    "as we present in section  [ section optimal solution apex on circular arc ] , at some point , the algorithm needs to calculate the roots of a fourth degree polynomial .",
    "this is unfortunate when it comes to numerical robustness .",
    "however , in section  [ section complexity solution ] , we show that we can not dodge such algebraic expressions .",
    "we finally conclude and present some related open problems in section  [ section conclusion ] .",
    "since the solution to the general problem only needs to consider the vertices of the convex hull of @xmath0 , the first step is to compute the convex hull . in the remainder of the paper , we assume that the input is a convex @xmath1-gon with vertices given in clockwise order .    let @xmath9 be a convex @xmath1-gon ( refer to figure  [ figure algo - step0 ] ) .",

    "we begin with two definitions .",
    "let @xmath13 be a point in the plane and @xmath3 be an angle ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be two rays emanating from @xmath13 such that the angle between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is @xmath3 .",
    "we say that the closed set formed by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the points between @xmath14 and @xmath15 creates an _",
    "@xmath3-wedge _ , denoted @xmath16 .",
    "the point @xmath13 is called the _ apex _ of the @xmath3-wedge .",

    "the apex traces a sequence of circular arcs that we call an",
    "_ @xmath3-cloud _",
    "( refer to figure  [ figure algo - step1 ] ) .",
    "there are many technical details involved in the solution to this problem . before getting too caught up in the technical details ,",
    "let us first review the general approach to our solution .",
    "since we only consider enclosing triangles with an angle of @xmath3 , each optimal triangle can be constructed from an @xmath3-wedge that encloses @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we consider all possible @xmath3-wedges that enclose @xmath9 .",
    "the apices of these @xmath3-wedges lie on an @xmath3-cloud @xmath19 which consists of a linear number of pieces of circular arcs ( refer to  @xcite ) .",
    "then , for each of these @xmath3-wedges , we find the minimal triangle by identifying a third side .",
    "for the triangle to be optimal , the midpoint of this third side has to touch @xmath9 ( see proposition  [ proposition n - gon wedge minimal triangle ] and corollary  [ corollary n - gon wedge minimal triangle ] ) .",
    "hence , for each enclosing @xmath3-wedge , there is one and only one triangle to consider for optimality .",
    "moreover , when the apex @xmath13 of an @xmath3-wedge @xmath17 moves clockwise around the @xmath3-cloud @xmath19 , the midpoint @xmath20 of the third side of the optimal triangle moves clockwise around @xmath9 ( see lemma  [ lemma q turns clockwise and so does m ] ) . as @xmath17 moves",
    ", we note the positions of @xmath13 where @xmath20 leaves an edge of @xmath9 and where @xmath20 enters a new edge of @xmath9 .",
    "these positions of @xmath13 are important event points .",
    "they divide @xmath19 into a linear number of sections ( see section  [ section walking around omega cloud ] ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be one of these sections .",
    "we prove that the minimum triangle having a vertex ( hence an angle @xmath3 ) on @xmath0 can be computed in constant time ( see lemmas  [ lemma arc fixed point minimal triangle ] , [ lemma arc fixed line minimal triangle ] , [ lemma vertex fixed point minimal triangle ] and  [ lemma vertex fixed line minimal triangle ] ) .",
    "we then have a linear number of candidates ( one for each section of @xmath19 ) to consider rather than infinitely many if we had to take all possible enclosing @xmath3-wedges into account .",
    "what remains is to identify the optimal ones from these linear candidates . with this in mind , the technical details will fall into place .",
    "step 1 : :    compute the @xmath3-cloud around @xmath9 and    denote it by @xmath19 .",
