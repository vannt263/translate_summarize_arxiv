    "traditionally , market risk is proxied by the distribution of asset log - returns @xmath2 on different scales @xmath3 .",
    "such distribution for most assets in various classes is well - known to have a power law tail @xmath4 \\sim x^{-\\mu}$ ] with the `` tail exponent '' @xmath5 in the range from 3 to 5 both for daily  @xcite and intraday returns  @xcite .",
    "though the second and possibly third order moments of the distribution exist , the traditional volatility measures based on variance of returns are not sufficient for quantifying the risk associated with extreme events .",
    "much better metrics to capture systematic events are the so - called _ drawdowns _ ( and their complements , the _ drawups _ ) , which are traditionally defined as a persistent decrease ( respectively increase ) in the price over consecutive @xmath3-time intervals @xcite . in other words ,",
    "a drawdown is the cumulative loss from the last maximum to the next minimum of the price , and a drawup is the the price change between a local minimum and the following maximum . by definition , drawups and drawdowns",
    "alternate : a drawdown follows a drawup and vice versa .",
    "in contrast to simple returns , drawdowns are much more flexible measures of risk as they also capture the transient time - dependence of consecutive price changes .",
    "drawdowns quantify the worst - case scenario of an investor buying at the local high and selling at the next minimum ( similarly drawups quantifies the upside potential of buying at the lowest price and selling at the highest one ) .",
    "the duration of drawdowns is not fixed as well : some drawdowns can end in one drop of duration @xmath3 , when others may last for tens to hundreds @xmath3 s .",
    "the distribution of drawdowns contains information that is quite different from the distribution of returns over a fixed time scale .",
    "in particular , a drawdown reflects a transient `` memory '' of the market by accounting for possible inter - dependence during series of losses  @xcite . during crashes , positive feedback mechanisms are activated so that previous losses lead to further selling , strengthening the downward trend , as for instance as a result of the implementation of so - called portfolio insurance strategies @xcite .",
    "the resulting drawdowns will capture these transient positive feedbacks , much more than the returns or even the two - point correlation functions between returns or between volatilities .",
    "in contrast to autocorrelation measures , which quantify the average ( or global ) serial linear dependence between returns over a generally large chosen time period , drawdowns are local measures , i.e. they account for rather instantaneous dependences between returns that are specific to a given event .",
    "statistically , drawdowns are related to the notion of `` runs '' that is often used in econometrics  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of the statistical properties of intraday drawdowns and drawups .",
    "our tests are performed on the most liquid futures contracts of the world .",
    "our results are thus of general relevance and are offered as novel `` stylized facts '' of the price dynamics .",
    "we discuss and quantify the distribution of intra - day extreme events , and compare distributional characteristics of drawdowns with those of individual returns . in so doing",
    ", we discover that the generally accepted description of the tail of the distribution of returns by a power law distribution is incorrect : we find highly statistically significant upward deviations from the power law by the most extreme events .",
    "these deviations are associated with well - known events , such as the `` flash - crash '' of may 6 , 2010 .",
    "statistical tests designed to detect such deviations confirm their high significance , implying that these events belong to a special class of so - called",
    "_ `` dragon - kings '' _ @xcite : these events are generated with different amplifying mechanisms than the rest of the population .",
    "we show that some of these events can be attributed to an internal mutual - excitation between market participants , while others are pure response to external news . as for extreme drawdowns , there are in principle two end - member generating mechanisms for them : ( i ) one return in the run of losses is an extreme loss and , by itself alone , makes the drawdown extreme ; ( ii ) rare transient dependences between negative returns make some runs especially large .",
    "we document that most of the extreme drawdowns are generated by the second mechanism , that is , by emerging spontaneous correlation patterns , rather than by the domination of one or a few extreme individual returns .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] discusses the high - frequency data and cleaning procedures .",
    "section  [ sec : dd ] presents the detection method of the so - called _",
    "@xmath0-drawdowns _ that we use as a proxy of transient directional price movements .",
    "section  [ sec : descript_stat ] provides descriptive statistics of the detected events .",
    "section  [ sec : distrib_dd ] focuses on the properties of the distributions of drawdowns and quantify their tails as belonging essentially to a power law regime . in section  [ sec : dragonkings ] , we present a generalised dragon - king test ( dk - test ) , derived and improved from @xcite , which allows us to quantify the statistical significance of the deviations of extreme drawdowns from the power law distribution calibrated on the rest of the distribution . section  [ sec : distrib_aggragated ] describes the aggregated distributions over all tickers and validates that our findings hold both at individual and global levels . for this , we use the generalised dk - test as well as the parametric u - test also introduced by @xcite and study their respective complementary merits .",
    "section  [ sec : dependence ] examines the interdependence of the speed and durations of extreme drawdowns with respect to their size . section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "we use tick data for the most actively traded futures contracts on the world indices ( see table  [ tb : contracts ] ) from january 1 , 2005 to december 30 , 2011 . for futures on the omx stockholm 30 index ( omxs ) , our dataset starts from september 1 , 2005 ; and for futures on hong kong indexes ( hsi and hcei ) , our datasets are limited to the period before april 1 , 2011 . for futures on the bovespa index ( bovespa ) , we restrict our analysis to the period after january 1 , 2009 , ignoring the relatively inactive trading in 20052008 .",
    "many of the contracts presented in table [ tb : contracts ] are traded almost continuously ( e.g. e - mini s&p 500 futures contracts are traded every business day from monday to friday with only two trading halts : from 16:15 to 17:00 cdt and from 15:15 to 15:30 cdt ) .",
    "though it is being progressively changing  @xcite , most of the daily volume is traded within so - called regular trading hours ( rth , in case of e - mini contracts : 8:3015:15 cdt ) . for asian exchanges , the activity within regular trading hours is also non - uniform . for the analysis ,",
    "we have limited ourselves only to the part of rth where the trading is the most active ( in terms of volume ) , which we refer to as an active trading hours ( ath ) in table  [ tb : contracts ] .",
    ".description of the futures contracts used for analysis . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     these results validate our previous findings .",
    "first , fits of the distribution of drawdowns / drawups are much more robust than for individual log - returns .",
    "second , the reported exponents of the power law tails for the aggregated distributions lie in the same range of values that we reported for individual contracts ( see figure  [ fig : boxplot ] ) .",
    "third , the estimated exponent @xmath6 for drawdowns is significantly larger than the exponent @xmath6 for drawups ( the difference is larger than 6 standard errors ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ccdf_aggregated ] and table  [ tb : fit_aggregated ] show that the power law approximation of the normalized speeds of drawdowns and drawups is almost perfect and holds for more than 5 orders of magnitude in the vertical axis .",
    "in contrast , the fits of the tails of the distributions of durations are relatively poor .",
    "in particular , the hypothesis that the distribution of drawup durations is a power law can be rejected in favor of the stretched exponential distribution family using the nested wilks test  @xcite .    an important observation from figure  [ fig : ccdf_aggregated ]",
    "is that the extreme events of individual distributions ( figure  [ fig : ccdf ] ) also branch off the aggregated distribution .",
    "one can clearly see that up to ten of the largest drawdowns and drawups deviate substantially from the power law fit of the tail .",
    "interestingly , the original  @xcite and the modified  ( section  [ sec : dragonkings ] ) dk - tests give contradictory and confusing results . however , `` the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence '' , which summarises the fallacy of the argumentum ad ignorantiam .",
    "in other words , we argue that the failure to diagnostic the largest drawdowns as outliers reflects the lack of power of these tests .",
    "as discussed above , the 1520 extremes events in the tail contribute substantially to the numerator in expression and lead to a spurious identification of up to 400 outliers in the tail ( the @xmath7 hypothesis is rejected for values of ranks @xmath8 up to @xmath9 ) . on the another hand , the modified dk - test   sins at the other extreme by being too conservative and fails to reject @xmath7 for any @xmath8 , because it requires the simultaneous rejection of @xmath7 for @xmath10 and the acceptance of @xmath7 for @xmath11 .",
    "this typically does not occur when outliers are not a few far - standing events , but are organised with a continuous and smooth deviation of the tail as in figure  [ fig : ccdf_aggregated ] .    to address this issue and test for the presence of a change of regime in the tail of the distribution",
    ", we employ the parametric u - test  @xcite , which tests deviation of the tail with respect to the fitted power law distribution rather than with respect to the rest of sample as in the dk - test .",
    "we present a slightly modified description of the u - test from that found in @xcite and provide a closed - form solution   of the maximum likelihood estimation of the power law exponent .",
    "we select the lower threshold @xmath12 for the calibration of the power law in the distribution tail and apply the same nonlinear transformation   as for the dk - test .",
    "then , by visual inspection , we determine a candidate for the rank @xmath8 such that observations smaller than @xmath13 ( i.e. , of rank larger than @xmath8 ) are distributed according to the exponential distribution   and the total number of outliers is not larger than @xmath8 .    the exponent @xmath14 of the exponential distribution can be estimated with the maximum likelihood method applied to the subsample @xmath11 , where the likelihood with right - censored observations is given by @xmath15^r\\prod_{k = r+1}^nf(y_k),\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the cdf of the exponential distribution   and @xmath17 is the corresponding pdf .",
    "the exponent @xmath14 can then be estimated by maximizing @xmath18 . in the case of an exponential distribution  , this yields the closed form expression @xmath19^{-1}\\ ] ] the p - values that the @xmath20 smallest ranks deviate from the null hypothesis of the exponential distribution can be then obtained from the following equation ( see derivations in  @xcite ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normalized incomplete beta - function , and the exponent @xmath14 for the probability distribution   is taken to be equal to the mle ( [ eq : alpha_exp ] ) . the event @xmath23 for which @xmath24 can be then diagnosed as an outlier with respect to the fitted exponential distribution of the tail .",
    "this corresponds to the original event @xmath25 being a `` dragon - king '' with respect to the fitted power law distribution .    table  [ tb : dk_aggregated ] presents results of the application of the u - test to the aggregated distribution of normalized returns @xmath26 of drawdowns , where the threshold @xmath12 is selected by using the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( table  [ tb : fit_aggregated ] ) .",
    "the first important observation is that all `` dragon - king '' events that were detected for individual contracts ( table  [ tb : dk_dd ] ) are also quantified as belonging to a different regime than the power law for the aggregated distribution .",
    "this supports the findings of section  [ sec : dragonkings ]",
    ".    however , not all extremes ( events with rank 1 ) of the individual contracts are present n the upper tail of the aggregated distribution . for drawdowns ,",
    "the extreme tail of the aggregated distribution contains mostly events from european and us markets .",
    "for example , the extreme drawdowns for omxs , hcei , tamsci , nikkei , topix , asx and bovespa are not qualified as an outliers ( neither they were reported as `` dragon - kings '' at the individual level ) . for drawups ,",
    "the number of detected outliers is much smaller than for drawdowns .    on the contrary ,",
    "several events classified as outliers at the aggregate level were not reported as individual `` dragon - kings '' using the ( conservative ) modified dk - test .",
    "for example , we were unable to reject the null hypothesis @xmath7 for the two largest events occurring in the smi futures contracts ( figure  [ fig : ccdf ] ) .",
    "for @xmath27 , we report the following p - values : @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; for @xmath31 , we obtain p - values : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath30 and @xmath34 . in both cases ,",
    "one inequality of the system   does not hold .",
    "this results from the fact that the second event @xmath35 is not sufficiently larger than @xmath36 , which leads to the absence of rejection of the null ( no dragon - kings ) for @xmath27 ( @xmath37 ) . and",
    "the third event @xmath36 only slightly deviates from the tail ( @xmath30 for @xmath31 ) , which leads to the absence of rejection of the null for larger @xmath8 values .",
    "finally , all events detected as outliers of the aggregate distribution ( table  [ tb : dk_aggregated ] ) can be detected in their corresponding individual distributions using the u - test .",
    "however , being dependent on the calibration of the exponent of the power law , the u - test is subjected to estimation errors that need to be accounted properly .",
    "the nonparametric dk - test is free from this drawback , at the cost of having more limited power . in general , as with any statistical testing problem , it is always a good practice to consider several different tests to confirm the conclusions .",
    "are extreme drawdowns ( drawups ) associated with the largest speed and/or the longer durations ?",
    "clarifying the interdependence between size , speed and duration of extreme drawdown ( drawups ) is important to better understand their generating mechanism . in previous sections ,",
    "we have already commented that events that are extreme with respect to one characteristic may not be extreme with respect to another ( see tables  [ tb : dk_dd ] and  [ tb : dk_dd_dur_speed ] ) .",
    "the largest ( with respect to @xmath26 ) drawdowns and drawups are often not the fastest , and by far not the longest events in the population .",
    "the occurrence of an extreme normalized speed @xmath38 does not ensure that the event will have an extreme size .",
    "moreover , the longest drawdowns and drawups typically have relatively small returns .",
    "our goal here is to quantify the mutual interdependence between size , speed and duration .",
    "generally , the complete information about the dependence between two random variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 is contained in their copula structure . here , we consider a simpler metric , the tail dependence , which is defined at the probability of observing a very large value of one variable conditional on the occurrence of a very large value of the other variable @xcite : @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the marginal cumulative distributional functions of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in practice , it is difficult to work with the asymptotic tail dependence @xmath44 , which is defined in the empirically unattainable limit @xmath45 .",
    "we will thus consider @xmath46 for fixed value of probability @xmath47 and document the behaviour of @xmath46 as @xmath48 approaches @xmath49 from below .     for normalized returns @xmath26 and normalized speeds @xmath38 ( solid lines ) and for normalized returns @xmath26 and durations @xmath50 ( dashed lines ) of the aggregated drawdowns ( red ) and drawups ( green ) for different contracts and different probabilities @xmath48.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    figure  [ fig : td_aggregated ] shows the non - asymptotic tail dependence coefficients @xmath46 of ( i ) @xmath51 and @xmath52 and ( ii ) @xmath51 and @xmath53 for the aggregated probability distributions @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( marginal distributions are presented in figure  [ fig : ccdf_aggregated ] ) . in other words ,",
    "figure  [ fig : td_aggregated ] quantifies the probability that the observed drawdown is large , conditional on it being ( i ) fast or ( ii ) long .",
    "one can observe that @xmath46 of the normalized returns conditional on the durations decreases monotonously with @xmath48 and converges to zero as @xmath56 .",
    "this indicates an absence of dependence of the extreme values of size and durations . in other words , the longest drawdowns and drawups",
    "do not belong to the highest quantiles in term of sizes .    on the contrary ,",
    "the tail dependence @xmath46 between returns and speed is significant and tends to increase for @xmath45 , except very close to @xmath49 ( @xmath57 ) due to the finite size of the data sample .",
    "the estimated value of the tail dependence @xmath46 between returns and speed is approximatively in the range @xmath58 for drawdowns and @xmath59 for drawups , i.e. , conditional on a very large speed , there is about a 10% probability that the corresponding drawdown ( drawup ) is extreme in normalised return .",
    "figure  [ fig : tail_dependence ] , which presents the tail dependence coefficients @xmath46 at three probability levels @xmath60 and @xmath61 for individual contracts , supports our previous findings at the aggregate level . with the exception of the omxs , hcei and asx contracts that are characterised by monotonously decaying @xmath46 ,",
    "all other analyzed future contracts exhibit clear signatures of non - zero tail dependence with @xmath46 varying in the range @xmath62 ( for nikkei , topix ) and @xmath63 ( for cac , dax , aex , stoxx , dj , nifty ) .     between normalized returns",
    "@xmath26 and normalized speeds @xmath38 of drawdowns ( red bars ) and drawups ( green bars , inverted x - axis ) for different contracts and different probability levels @xmath48 .",
    "the last row corresponds to the aggregated distributions . ]",
    "we have investigated the distributions of @xmath0-drawdowns and @xmath0-drawups of the most liquid futures financial contracts of the world at time scales of @xmath1 seconds .",
    "the @xmath0-drawdowns and @xmath0-drawups defined by expressions ( [ eq : delta ] ) with ( [ eq : cond ] ) are proposed as robust measures of the risks to which investors are arguably the most concerned with .",
    "the time scale of @xmath1 seconds for the time steps used to defined the drawdown and drawups is chosen as a compromise between robustness with respect to microstructure effects and reactivity to regime changes in the time dynamics . similarly to the distribution of returns , we find that the distributions of @xmath0-drawdowns and @xmath0-drawups exhibit power law tails , albeit with exponents significantly larger than those for the return distribution . this paradoxical result can be attributed to ( i ) the existence of significant transient dependence between returns and ( ii ) the presence of large outliers ( termed dragon - kings @xcite ) characterizing the extreme tail of the drawdown / drawup distributions deviating from the power law .",

    "the study of the tail dependence between drawdown / drawup sizes , speeds and durations indicates a clear relationship between size and speed but none between size and duration .",
