    "since the experimental realization of graphene,@xcite a monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , this material has aroused enormous interest due to its unique physical characteristics.@xcite among different works in this field , the linear optical property of graphene is one of the main focuses of attention.@xcite the theoretical works based on the dirac hamiltonian show that the optical conductivity at high frequency is dominated by the interband optical conductivity , which takes a constant value of @xmath0 for frequency larger than twice of the fermi energy @xmath1 and approaches to zero for frequency below @xmath2 due to the pauli blocking.@xcite the universal value @xmath3 of optical conductivity has been demonstrated to be valid not only in the noninteracting limit,@xcite but also in the presence of the disorder and the electron - electron interaction as long as the dirac - cone approximation remains valid.@xcite the constant optical conductivity in a wide range of frequency also has been observed in the optical experiments.@xcite on the other hand , the optical conductivity at low frequency is determined by the intraband optical conductivity , which presents a drude peak centred at zero frequency and is strongly influenced by the sample - dependent scattering behavior.@xcite recently , influence of an intense ac field on electrical and optical properties in graphene has also attracted much attention . @xcite it has been found that the application of an intense ac field can dramatically modify the band structure and hence the density of states ( dos).@xcite their results also showed that a stationary energy gap appears around the dirac point under a circularly polarized ac field.@xcite oka and aoki@xcite calculated the dc and ac conductivities in graphene irradiated by an intense circularly polarized light via the extended kubo formula , and proposed the photovoltaic hall effect , which is a novel hall effect occuring in the absence of uniform magnetic fields .",
    "the dc transport properties of graphene - based p - n junctions under an intense ac field were also investigated theoretically.@xcite however , contribution in the optical spectra in graphene from the optical sidebands@xcite has not yet been well investigated .    in semiconductors ,",
    "the contribution from the sidebands has been demonstrated to be important for the optical and transport properties .",
    "many interesting phenomena , such as the photon - assisted tunneling,@xcite the sideband generation of exciton,@xcite the ac stark effect,@xcite and the dynamical franz - keldysh ( dfk ) effect,@xcite as well as spin generation and manipulation utilized by the intense terahertz ( thz ) field@xcite are related to the formation of sidebands . among these effects , the dfk effect describes the influence on optical spectra from the sidebands of the expanded states,@xcite which includes finite absorption below the band edge from the contribution of the sidebands below the bottom of the conduction band and the step - like behavior above the band edge due to the sideband - modulated generalized dos .",
    "just as the dfk effect in semiconductors , the formation of optical sidebands should also influence the optical spectra near the absorption edge around @xmath4 in graphene .",
    "nevertheless , the band structure of graphene is gapless and the energy dispersion is linear , which is quite distinct from semiconductors .",
    "thus the dfk effect in graphene is expected to present some unique behaviors .",
    "this makes the investigation on this problem become very interesting and important .",
    "it is also noted that in previous investigation@xcite only the optical conductivity with @xmath5 much smaller than the frequency of the ac field was discussed and thus the contribution from the optical sidebands is difficult to identify . in the present work , we calculate the optical conductivity of graphene under the intense thz field for various fermi energies and field strengths in order to gain a complete view of the dfk effect in graphene .    in order to include the contribution from the optical sidebands explicitly , we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation by using the floquet theory@xcite and obtain the optical conductivity in graphene under an intense thz field via the nonequlibrium green functions.@xcite in this paper , we focus on the optical conductivity at high frequency , which is known to be insensitive to the scattering strength.@xcite this allows us to ignore the detail of the scattering and only discuss the optical conductivity in the noninteracting limit .",
    "we first examine the energy spectrum and dos .",
    "it is found that gaps appear in the quasi - energy spectrum due to the single - photon / multi - photon resonances.@xcite these quasi - energy gaps are pronounced at small momentum , in consistence with the previous investigations.@xcite however , the quasi - energy gaps decrease dramatically with the increase of momentum and finally disappear when the momentum is large enough .",
    "therefore after taking account of the contribution from the states with large momentum , gaps in the dos are effectively closed , in contrast to the prediction by oka and aoki.@xcite our results of the optical conductivity reveal the main features of the dfk effect in graphene .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "iia , we obtain the energy spectrum by exploiting the floquet theory . then in sec .",
    "iib , we derive the optical conductivity via the nonequlibrium green functions .",
    "the numerical results of the dos and optical conductivity are presented in sec .",
    "finally , we summarize in sec .  iv .",
    "we consider a graphene layer placed in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane . in the vicinity of the dirac point , the effective hamiltonian of graphene can be written as ( @xmath8)@xcite @xmath9 here @xmath10 for @xmath11 valley ; @xmath12 is the fermi velocity ; @xmath13 represents the two - dimensional wave vector relative to @xmath11 point ; @xmath14 is the pauli matrix in the pseudospin space formed by the a and b sublattices of the honeycomb lattice . here and hereafter ,",

    "it is evident that the eigenvectors of @xmath43 and @xmath34 satisfy @xmath44 , thus @xmath43 and @xmath34 correspond to the same physical solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "namely , the quasi - energy is a multi - valued quantity of the floquet state.@xcite nevertheless , for each momentum and each valley , the number of the independent quasi - energies is 2 , which is determined by the dimension of the hilbert space . for convenience , we choose the independent quasi - energies @xmath45 in the reduced floquet zone @xmath46 $ ] , with @xmath47 representing the index of independent solutions .",
    "these quasi - energies are referred to as the reduced quasi - energies in the following .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are labelled as @xmath48 . therefore , by choosing the proper integer @xmath49 , arbitrary quasi - energy @xmath50 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath51 can be written into the form @xmath52 in addition , for the reduced quasi - energies with different @xmath53 , one has @xmath54    from eq .",
    "( [ phi_def ] ) , it is seen that the floquet state @xmath55 ( the general solution index @xmath33 has been replaced by the independent solution index @xmath53 ) contains fourier components with different frequencies , quite distinct from the eigenstate of @xmath56 , which only takes one eigen - frequency .",
    "each fourier component corresponds to a sideband of this floquet state . for the floquet states with reduced quasi - energy @xmath57 , sidebands appear at the frequencies ( quasi - energies ) @xmath58 and the corresponding weights are @xmath59 from eqs .",
    "( [ symmetry_1 ] ) and ( [ symmetry_2 ] ) , one can see that the quasi - energies and weights of the sidebands satisfy @xmath60    besides the quasi - energy , another important quantity of the floquet state is the mean energy@xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the period of the applied thz field .",
    "independent of the choice of the quasi - energy , the mean energy is a single - valued structure quantity of the floquet state .",
    "thus in previous works,@xcite the mean energy was utilized to identify the filled floquet states , i.e. states with lower mean energy will be occupied at first . in this paper",
    ", we also use this ansatz to obtain the distribution function of the floquet state , which will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "moreover , the mean energy is used to identify whether the floquet state is electron- or hole - like . analogous to the definition of the electron and hole states in the field - free case , we define the quasi - electron ( @xmath63 ) and quasi - hole states ( @xmath64 ) as the floquet states satisfying @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "it is known that the optical absorption is measured by the real part of optical conductivity.@xcite therefore we focus on the real part of the optical conductivity in the following . for the probing light field of frequency @xmath67 with the polarization in the @xmath49 @xmath68 direction , the linear - response theory yields the real part of optical conductivity : @xmath69 here @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the valley and spin degeneracies , respectively ; @xmath72 is retarded current - current correlation function in the @xmath73 valley . here and hereafter",

    "in particular , the energy spectrum at large momentum has not been well investigated in previous works . in this section , we investigate the energy spectrum under a circularly polarized thz field in a wide range of momentum . pronounced quasi - energy gaps appear at small momentum in both cases with low and high field strengths .",

    "all gaps at the same momentum share the identical magnitude due to the periodicity of the quasi - energy spectrum . these quasi - energy gaps can be attributed to the ac stark splittings induced by the single - photon / multi - photon resonances.@xcite the physics is that if a pair of states are coupled by an electromagnetic field with frequency @xmath122 and the energy difference between these two states equals to @xmath130 , then an ac stark splitting appears unless the corresponding transition is forbidden .",
