    "many m dwarfs , which are the most abundant stars in the milky way , have strong magnetic dynamos that give rise to chromospheric and coronal heating , producing emission from the x - ray to the radio .",
    "although this magnetic heating ( or activity ) has been observed for decades , the exact mechanisms that control magnetic activity in m dwarfs are still not well - understood . in the sun ,",
    "magnetic fields are generated at the boundary between the convective and the radiative zones ( known as the tachocline ) , where the differential rotation in the convective zone creates a rotational shear @xcite that allows magnetic fields to be generated , stored and ultimately rise to the surface .",
    "these fields drive the heating of the stellar chromosphere and corona , resulting in both flares and lower level quiescent magnetic activity . a common diagnostic of this heating in optical spectra ( of m dwarfs ) is the h@xmath0 emission line",
    ".    rotation in solar - type stars slows with time due to angular momentum loss from magnetized stellar winds ; as a result , magnetic activity decreases .",
    "@xcite found that both activity ( as measured by ca ii emission ) and projected rotational velocity decrease over time as a power law ( t@xmath5 ) .",
    "subsequent studies confirmed the skumanich results and demonstrated that there is a strong link between age , rotation and activity in solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "there is strong evidence that the rotation - activity relation extends from stars more massive than the sun to smaller dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , at a spectral type of @xmath6m3 ( 0.35 m@xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",

    "] , stars become fully convective and the tachocline presumably disappears .",
    "this transition marks an important change in the stellar interior that has been thought to affect the production and storage of internal magnetic fields . despite this change in the stellar interiors",
    ", magnetic activity persists in the late - type m dwarfs ; the fraction of active stars peaks around a spectral type of m7 before decreasing into the brown dwarf regime @xcite .",
    "a few previous studies of h@xmath0 emission have uncovered evidence of a possible rotation - activity relation extending past the m3 convective transition and into the brown dwarf regime @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent simulations of magnetic dynamo generation in fully convective stars find that rotation may play a role in magnetic field generation @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of an unbiased sample of high resolution spectra of late - type m dwarfs complicates the situation .    using over 30000 spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite showed that the activity fraction of m dwarfs varies as a function of stellar age ( using galactic height as a proxy for age ) and that the h@xmath0 activity lifetime for m6-m7.5 stars is 7 - 8 gyr .",
    "nearby samples of late - type m dwarfs are therefore biased towards young populations with high levels of activity ; until recently every known m7 dwarf was observed to be magnetically active @xcite .    due to the intrinsic faintness of late - type m dwarfs ,",
    "previous rotation studies were limited ( and therefore biased ) toward , bright , nearby , and therefore active m dwarfs ; the 21 m6-m7.5 dwarfs that have previous rotation measurements are all active @xcite .",
    "the advent of large spectroscopic surveys of m dwarfs ( e.g.sdss ) allows for improved sample selection that can minimize observational bias in the study of late - type m dwarfs .    in this paper we present results from our study of the @xmath1sin@xmath2 rotation velocities for a small sample of m6-m7 dwarfs ,",
    "most of which were selected to be inactive or weakly active from the sdss low - mass star spectroscopic sample .",
    "we describe the sample and observations in  2 , our analysis in  3 , and the observational results in  4 .",
    "we then discuss our results in  5 .",
    "our sample was selected from the @xcite sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) m dwarf catalog , a spectroscopic sample of almost 40000 m and l - type dwarfs .",
    "we selected the brightest m6 and m7 stars which were either inactive ( h@xmath0 equivalent width @xmath8 0.3 ) or weakly active ( h@xmath0 equivalent width @xmath8 1.0 ) .",
    "12 stars were selected using these criteria .",
    "two additional active ( h@xmath0 equivalent width @xmath9 1.0 ) m7 dwarfs were added to the sample for comparison to previous studies .",
    "while our sample is not a complete unbiased sample , representative of the underlying m dwarf population , it does consist of late - type m dwarfs with activity properties selectively different than previously observed .",
    "the 14 stars were observed during four observing runs ( 13 october 2006 , 14 october 2006 , 25 april 2007 , and 24 january 2008 ) using the hires spectrograph at keck i. our setup covered the wavelength region from 5600 to 10000   with a resolution of r@xmath630000 .",
    "the data were reduced with standard idl routines that included flat - fielding , sky subtraction and cosmic ray removal .",
    "in addition to our 14 program stars , we observed the nearby m6 dwarf gl406 , a star with no measurable rotation @xcite that we used as a zero rotation velocity template .",
    "to measure the @xmath1sin@xmath2 rotation velocities for our sample , we used a cross - correlation technique similar to that of previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) : we cross - correlated each program spectrum with the spectrum of a slowly rotating comparison star .",
    "the width of the resulting cross correlation function is a direct probe of the rotational broadening .",
    "we used gl 406 ( m6 ) as our template because it has a similar spectral type to our sample as well as a small ( non detectable ) rotation velocity @xcite .",
    "four wavelength regions with strong molecular bands were used to compute independent cross - correlation functions : 6700 - 6760  , 7080 - 7140  , 8430 - 8500   ( adapted from * ? ? ?",

    ".    to measure the rotational broadening of each spectrum , we compared the resulting cross - correlation function to that of a rotationally broadened template .",
    "the gl 406 and sdss125855.13 + 052034.7 templates were rotationally broadened to larger rotation velocities using the technique of @xcite and cross - correlated with the original ( unbroadened ) template in 0.5 kms@xmath4 intervals .",
    "the resulting spun - up cross - correlation functions were compared with the cross - correlation functions of the sample spectra and a @xmath1sin@xmath2 was determined based on the best fit spun - up template .",

    "one possible explanation is that rotation and activity are not strongly linked in the fully convective envelopes of m6-m7 dwarfs .",
    "previous studies only examined active m6-m7 dwarfs , many of which have activity levels with no notable correlation with rotation beyond a general tendancy for rotators to lie in a broadly spread `` saturated '' activity regime .",
    "in fact , several active dwarfs have no detectable rotation ( see figure [ figure : vsini ] ) . besides saturation , another explanation for the lack of a strong relationship between activity and rotation is inclination ; the rotation axes of the stars may be inclined and therefore have reduced line - of - sight components to their rotation velocities . on the other hand , the 3 inactive stars with detected rotations certainly can not be resolved by simply imposing inclination effects , which can only serve to make their true rotations even higher .",
    "another possibility is that there is a rotationally - induced threshold for activity at v@xmath306 kms@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this would explain the inactive rotators ( they are below the threshold ) and require that active stars with @xmath1sin@xmath2 rotation velocities less than the threshold have inclined rotation axes .",
    "combining all of the previous rotation studies for m6-m7 ( figure [ figure : vsini ] ) , we see that 7 of the 26 active dwarfs have @xmath1sin@xmath31 6 kms@xmath4 ; the rest of the stars are rotating several kms@xmath4 above the detection thresholds . to quantify this possibility ,",
    "we follow the statistical analysis of @xcite , where we compute the probability ( from the binomial distribution ) of observing n objects with inclination @xmath2 @xmath8 @xmath32 .",
    "we find that the probability of randomly drawing a sample of 7 stars with the inclinations necessary to take the slow but active stars from a v@xmath33=6.5 kms@xmath4 to the observed @xmath1sin@xmath2 is 85.7% .",
    "if we instead calculate the more conservative probability of drawing inclinations that take the 7 stars from 8 kms@xmath4 ( the median @xmath1sin@xmath2 ) to their respective @xmath1sin@xmath2 values , we obtain 55.9% . in this scenario ,",
    "the inactive stars , which are presumably older , have spun down enough to fall below the rotation - activity threshold .    in earlier m dwarfs ,",
    "the mere detection of rotation implies that the star is in the `` saturation '' regime ; an effect that should have become even more pronounced for these even smaller objects ( assuming the convective overturn time is similar ) .",
    "all of our detected rotators have estimated rossby numbers that are beyond the `` saturation '' threshold for early - type m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that in these fully convective late - type m dwarfs , the rossby number `` saturation '' threshold might be substantially smaller .",
    "however , this model would imply that stars go from fully active to completely inactive over a small range of rossby numbers - something that contradicts what is seen in early - type m dwarfs , where the activity falls smoothly with increasing rossby number @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the velocity thresholds proposed here would have to be lowered ( as a function of spectral type ) to be compatible with the results of @xcite ; too many of their stars are active below @xmath1sin@xmath34 6 kms@xmath4 ( including several in the m5 - 6 spectral range ) .",
    "of course one additional possibility is that m6-m7 dwarfs might have activity cycles and that we are observing the inactive stars at a minimum in their cycles .",
    "although this might be observed for a small number of stars , it is unlikely that an activity minimum can explain the majority of inactive m dwarfs seen in the milky way .",
    "@xcite showed that the activity fractions of m dwarfs are strongly correlated with the height above the galactic plane ( and therefore age ) , a trend that cannont be explained by an activity cycle .",
    "the dearth of a large sample of nearby , inactive late - type dwarfs precludes large - scale follow - up that would further test the age - rotation - activity relation of fully convective low - mass dwarfs . however , future efforts to extend our analysis to both inactive m5 and m8 dwarfs will help elucidate the problem .",
    "the multi - epoch photometric observations produced by all sky time - resolved surveys ( e.g. pan - starrs and lsst ) will produce rotation periods for a large number of late - type m dwarfs that will eliminate the inclination effects . of course , inactive m dwarfs present a problem to this method in that they may not exhibit photometric variability ( if they do nt produce starspots ) . the combination of these and other future observations will help advance the understanding of what role rotation plays in the production of magnetic fields in fully convective objects , and provide crucial constraints for theoretical models of fully convective dynamos .",
    "they will also be a key component to understanding the feedback between magnetic fields and stellar angular momentum evolution through stellar activity .",
