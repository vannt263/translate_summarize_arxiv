    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are perhaps the most spectacular form of solar activity , which expel large quantities of plasma ( order of @xmath110@xmath5 to @xmath110@xmath6 kg ) at a speed of hundreds of km s@xmath7 with the fastest ones over 3000 km s@xmath7 @xcite .",

    "a magnetic cloud is able to produce severe geomagnetic disturbances if it interacts with the earth s magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "white - light coronagraph observations in the past decades have revealed that many cmes display a characteristic three - part structure : a bright loop - like leading front ( lf ) , a dark cavity underneath , and an embedded bright compact core @xcite .",
    "when a pre - cme structure lifts off from the associated source region , it can cause the expansion and successive stretching of the overlying magnetic field lines to form a cme . at the same time",
    ", the surrounding plasma accumulates at the cme front , thus enhancing the plasma density in the cme lf @xcite . in the middle",
    "corona ( e.g. , 310 r@xmath9 ) , densities in the lfs are usually in the order of 10@xmath10 to 10@xmath11 @xmath3 , which represent @xmath110100 times enhancement over the background corona at those heights @xcite .",
    "temperatures of the lfs at 1.5 r@xmath9 have also been inferred , ranging from 6.0 @xmath12 10@xmath13 k @xcite to 2.0 @xmath12 10@xmath11 k @xcite .",

    "for instance , the dark cavity and the bright core of the cme correspond to the whole flux rope and the magnetic dips of the flux rope , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "evidence for the existence of the flux ropes has been found in in - situ solar wind data , which often show a large angle rotation of the magnetic field in magnetic clouds @xcite .",
    "direct evidence of the flux rope comes in the existence of a conspicuous channel structure in the inner corona before and during a solar eruption @xcite .",
    "this channel initially appears as a twisted and writhed sigmoidal structure in high temperature passbands , for example in 131  at @xmath110 mk and 94  at @xmath16 mk seen by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to the three components , coronal dimmings are another interesting phenomenon with close connections to cmes .",
    "dimmings can be observed in soft x - rays @xcite , in euv @xcite , and even in h@xmath16 passbands @xcite .",
    "the commonly accepted physical explanation for coronal dimmings is that they represent a density drop in the inner corona resulting from the plasma escape or depletion in the wake of a cme @xcite , although plasma heating could also play a role , as hot plasma becomes less visible to the instruments sensitive primarily to lower temperatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that euv emission lines are optically thin and temperatures of dimmings do not change significantly , @xcite estimated a density depletion of @xmath150% at the early stage of dimmings .",
    "later on , the intensity of dimming region gradually recovers , with several possible causes identified , including heating of confined plasma in coronal loops @xcite , interchange reconnections between open magnetic field and small coronal loops @xcite , or outflows from the transition region @xcite .",
    "previous studies have revealed the properties of cme structures and associated dimmings to a certain extent .",

    "@xcite reconstructed the dem distribution of the cme core and found the plasma in the cme core was heated slightly during the cme eruption . from the dem maps derived by analyzing four _ soho_/eit bandpasses , @xcite found that the temperature of the euv dimmings mainly varied between @xmath175.0 and @xmath176.5 . before and after the dimmings , the average dem level decreased without a change in the overall temperature distribution ( also see , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , the dem method has also been used to determine the three - dimensional density and temperature structures in the quiet sun @xcite and to investigate the temperature evolution in the post - flare loop systems @xcite .    in this paper",

    ", we show the results , followed by discussion and conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the aia on board _ sdo _ images the solar atmosphere through ten passbands almost simultaneously , with a temporal cadence of 12 s , a spatial resolution of 1.2 , and a field of view ( fov ) of 1.3@xmath8 .",
    "six of the filters cover euv lines formed at coronal temperatures at 131  ( fe viii , fe xx , fe xxiii ) , 94  ( fe xviii ) , 335  ( fe xvi ) , 211  ( fe xiv ) , 193  ( fexii , fexxiv ) , and 171  ( fe ix ) , respectively .",
    "the temperature response functions of these passbands , as shown in figure [ f1 ] , indicate an effective temperature coverage from 0.6 to 20 mk @xcite . during a solar eruption ,",

    "the multi - passband broad - temperature capability of aia makes it ideal for constructing dem models of the distinct cme structures .",
    "the observed flux @xmath18 for each passband can be determined by : @xmath19 where the @xmath20 is the temperature response function of passband @xmath21 , and @xmath22 denotes the plasma dem in the corona . in this work , we use the  xrtdemiterative2.pro \" routine in ssw package to compute the dem .",

    ", see the appendix .      in this paper , we analyze three well - observed cme events , which occurred on 2010 november 03 , 2011 march 08 , and 2011 march 07 , respectively .",
    "we use the cme event on 2011 march 8 as shown in figure [ f2 ] to illustrate our analysis process .",
    "first , we use the  aiaprep.pro \" routine to process the aia images in six euv passbands to 1.5-level , which guarantees a relative coalignment accuracy less than 0.6@xcite .",
    "then , we outline three distinct regions ( shown as boxes in figure [ f2 ] ) to compute the dem .",
    "regions a and b correspond to the flare region and the quiet - sun region , respectively , while a portion of the hot channel is selected in region c. in each region , the dn counts in each of the six passbands are normalized by the exposure time and spatially averaged over all pixels in the region .",
    "we use these averaged count rates as the input of ",
    "xrtdemiterative2 \" routine to calculate the dem curve .",
    "figure [ f3](a ) shows the dem result for the flare region .",
    "the black solid curve indicates the best - fit dem solution to the observed fluxes . in order to estimate dem uncertainties , we compute 100 monte carlo ( mc ) realizations of the data . for each mc simulation , the observed flux @xmath18 in each passband",
    "is perturbed by an amount of @xmath23 , which is randomly drawn from gaussian distribution with a sigma equal to the uncertainty in the observed flux .",
    "the uncertainty is obtained by ",
    "aiabpestimateerror.pro \" routine ( boerner 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "the dem code is then rerun for each of 100 mc realizations .",
    "the 100 mc solutions thus represent 100  equivalent \" solutions of the original data within the noise on each channel .",
    "we use a blue rectangle , as show in figure [ f3](a ) , to represent the region surrounding the best - fit solution that contains 50% of the mc solutions .",
    "the region consisting of two red rectangles and a blue rectangle covers 80% of the mc solutions .",
    "the region including all of colored rectangles contains 95% of the mc solutions .",
    "thus , the upper and lower ends of these colored rectangles can be regarded as estimates of the uncertainties in the best - fit solution , indicating how well the dem is determined at a given temperature bin .",
    "the flare region dem shows a broad temperature distribution from @xmath10.8 mk to 20 mk ( or 5.9 @xmath24 7.3 ) , indicating that plasmas with a wide range of temperatures are present in the compact flare region . here",
    ", we introduce a useful parameter that characterizes the overall temperature of the plasma , i.e. , the dem - weighted average temperature defined as : @xmath25 using this definition , the average plasma temperature in the flare region is @xmath19 mk , indicating that high temperature plasma dominates the emission of the flare region .",
    "further , the errors of the dem solutions are very small in the temperature range of 5.9 @xmath24 7.3 , indicating that the dem is well constrained by the aia data over most of the temperature range of the flare region .",
    "the dem profiles for the selected quiet - sun region and the flux rope region are shown in figure [ f3](b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "we can see that the emission in the quiet - sun region is dominated by plasma with lower temperatures ( 5.9 @xmath24 6.5 ) , over which the dem is well constrained ; the quiet - sun region has an average temperature at @xmath12 mk .",
    "the peak dem of the quiet - sun region is almost one order of magnitude lower than that of the flare region .",
    "the flux rope region seems to have two plasma components : the lower temperature component is similar in temperature distribution to that of the quiet region , but there is an additional , well - separated component of high temperature plasma . the average temperature of the flux rope is @xmath18 mk , indicating that it is somehow significantly heated during the eruption process .",
    "we also calculate the total emission measure ( em ) using : @xmath26 it is noteworthy that the total em of the flare region is @xmath110@xmath27 @xmath28 , almost two orders higher than that of the quiet - sun region of 10@xmath29 @xmath28 . due to the contribution of its high temperature plasma ,",
    "the total em of the flux rope is up to @xmath110@xmath30 @xmath28 , one order higher than that of the quiet - sun region although lower than that of the flare region .",
    "these total em values , as well as the dem - weighted average temperature are also indicated in figure [ f3 ] .",
    "note that all above integrations are carried out over the same temperature range 5.9 @xmath24 7.3 .",
    "it is well known that dem inversion is ill - posed and technically fraught with perils . on the one hand ,",
    "errors in dem inversion arise from the uncertainties in the response function @xmath20 , including non - ionization equilibrium effects , non - thermal populations of electrons , modifications of dielectronic recombination rates owing to finite density plasmas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even radiative transfer effects @xcite .",
    "moreover , the filling factor of the plasma is unknown , affecting density determinations . considering these effects",
    ", @xcite estimated an uncertainty of 20% for @xmath20 although it is still a lower limit .",
    "on the other hand , errors in dem inversion also originate in the uncertainties in the background determination , which is very important for dem analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to obtain the true dem distribution inside the flux rope , the emission from the background needs to be removed from the observed flux . for flux ropes ,",
    "the background is determined from the nearby quiet - sun regions ( white boxes in figure [ f4 ] ) , which are close to and have the same heliocentric distance ( to ensure a similar path along the line of sight in the corona ) as the selected flux rope sub - regions .",
    "we further inspect the effects of different backgrounds on our results and find that the dem profiles do not change significantly , but the resulting parameters , e.g. , average temperature , total em , and density , vary by @xmath130% . for the cme lfs and dimming regions , however , we use the observed fluxes to calculate the dem directly without subtracting the flux from a nearby region , since the emission in the lfs and dimmings comes from a large region along the line of sight . in order to reveal the dem changes",
    ", we compare the dem in the same location before and after the lfs and dimmings formation .",
    "finally , we note that a cool line component was missing in the old response function of aia 94  passband @xcite and there were also concerns about the accuracy of the 131  response function @xcite .",
    "we use the revised response functions ( updated on 2012 january 30 ) , in which the cool lines have been added to 94 and 131  passbands , to avoid the issue of the missing cool line component .",
    "as previously noted , a cme flux rope usually appears as an isolated channel structure in 131  and 94  images @xcite .",
    "three such flux ropes are shown in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "they are viewed in different orientations : the first one is largely seen along its axis , while the other two are mostly viewed from the side . for each event , we select three different sub - regions along the flux rope to calculate their dems ( black boxes in figure [ f4 ] ) ; the corresponding background regions are shown by the white boxes in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "the three sub - regions for the 2010 november 03 cme flux rope are shown in the upper left panel of figure [ f4 ] : one located close to the rim of the flux rope ( region a ) , the other two close to the center of the flux rope ( regions b and c ) . the resulting dems are shown in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "we find that at the rim of the flux rope , the plasma has an average temperature of @xmath318.3 mk , while at the center of the flux rope , the plasma temperature is @xmath319.0 mk .",
    "the average temperature appears to decrease from the center to rim of the flux rope .",
    "but , the difference may not be taken seriously given the large uncertainty in these values .",
    "based on the total em of the flux rope , we can estimate its density , assuming that the depth of the flux rope along the line of sight is approximately equal to its width , which can be measured directly ( as shown by the black lines in figure [ f4 ] ) .",
    "we calculate the density @xmath32 in the flux rope using : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the depth ( or width ) of the flux rope .",
    "note that , the filling factor in the density calculation is assumed to be 1 . at the rim of the flux rope , with the estimated width of @xmath140 mm , the total em of 2.1 @xmath35 @xmath28 corresponds to a density of 7.2 @xmath36 @xmath3 ( region a ) . toward the flux rope center ,",
    "the density increases to @xmath37 @xmath3 , which is mainly due to the enhanced total em ( regions b and c ) .",
    "these results imply that the flux rope has not only a temperature structure but also a density structure .",
    "the maxima of both the temperature and the density occur near the flux rope center , with values tending to decrease in the regions away from there .",
    "the average temperature , the density , total em , as well as the width used in the calculation are also indicated in the left - upper corner of figure [ f5 ] .    unlike 2010 november 03 event",
    ", the flux rope on 2011 march 08 appears as a semi - circular tube with two footpoints fixed in the photosphere .",
    "the middle upper panel of figure [ f4 ] shows the three small sub - regions we selected for dem analysis . due to a lower count rate at the top of the flux rope ( region a ) ,",
    "the dem curve is poorly constrained in all but a few temperature bins .",
    "nevertheless , the derived parameters for this sub - region are @xmath3810.9 mk , @xmath397.4 @xmath36 @xmath3 ( figure [ f6](a ) ) . in contrast , the dem curves in the two legs of the flux curves are well constrained , with the errors smaller ( figure [ f6](b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "most of the emission originates from high temperature plasma ( 6.6 @xmath24 7.2 ; @xmath319.0 mk ) .",
    "the calculated densities are also higher ( 1.22.4 @xmath2 @xmath3 ) .",
    "the flux rope on 2011 march 07 is similar to the 2011 march 08 event in terms of orientation , but is associated with a filament .",
    "most of cool filament material is located at the bottom of the flux rope structure , as shown in the right bottom panel of figure [ f4 ] . from the dem results of regions",
    "a and c ( figure [ f7 ] ) , we find that a significant amount of the emission is dominated by plasma with a cooler temperature ( @xmath407.0 mk ) , likely due to the presence of much cooler and denser filament material ( 0.61.7 @xmath2 @xmath3 ) .",
    "region b is far from the filament region , thus is not contaminated by the cooler chromosphere material .",
    "it has a higher average temperature ( @xmath319.0 mk ) and a lower plasma density ( 5.3 @xmath36 @xmath3 ) , and has more emission from the high temperature component of the plasma .",
    "thus , we conclude that , except when mixed with a much cooler and denser filament component , a flux rope during its eruption is typically of a structure of hot plasma with an average temperature of @xmath110.0 mk and a density of 1.0 @xmath2 @xmath3 .    the 2010 november 03 flux rope has exceptionally high counts throughout its eruption , thus making it an ideal case for studying the temperature evolution of the flux rope .",
    "we select the sub - regions including the maximum intensity as the flux rope centroid , which are indicated by the boxes in figure [ f8 ] .",
    "we derived the dem distribution every 12 seconds from 12:14 ut to 12:17 ut , and show the evolution of the average temperature in figure [ f9 ] .",
    "we find that the flux rope centroid is further heated during the eruption ; i.e. , @xmath41 increased from @xmath18.0 mk to @xmath110.0 mk , as the flux rope rose up and accelerated ; the full kinematic evolution of this event can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that , just for the purposes of investigating the relative change of the temperature , the background fluxes were _ not _ subtracted from the observed fluxes before calculating the dem curves ( we implicitly assume the background is small and remains roughly constant . ) .",
    "the eruption of the flux rope can push against the overlying magnetic field , whose expansion generates a compression front , observed here as the lf .",
    "a lf can be best seen in running or base difference images .",
    "figure [ f10 ] shows the 171  or 211  base difference images of the three cme events .",
    "the base difference images are obtained through subtracting a pre - event image at a fixed time ( the base ) from the current images .",
    "the lf structure in the euv images is very similar to those in coronagraph images .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the brightening front is caused by enhanced plasma density or an increase of temperature ( or some combination ) .",
    "we address this issue in this section using dem analysis .",
    "the selected locations for the lfs of the three cmes are shown in the boxes in figure [ f10 ] ; we calculate the dem distribution for each region . in order to reveal the dem changes after the lf formation , the dem of the same location but for the pre - eruption state ( pre - lf ) is also calculated .",
    "the result of the 2010 november 03 lf is shown in figure [ f11](b ) .",
    "we find that the most significant ( and well constrained ) part of the dem lies only in the lower temperature bins ( 6.0 @xmath24 6.4 ) .",
    "the dem indicates that the lf plasma has no significant component with @xmath426.5 .",
    "one interesting result of these analyses is that the shapes of the dems do not vary greatly before and after the lf appearance ( figure [ f11](a ) and ( b ) ) , indicating that the lf has a similar temperature distribution as the pre - eruption state .",
    "the average temperature for the lf and pre - lf are both @xmath12.1 mk .",
    "this implies that the lf is not significantly affected by the strong heating process occurring near the core region during the eruption of the flux rope ; almost all the released thermal energy , possibly via the process of magnetic reconnection , is confined to the region _ beneath _ the cme lf .",
    "we calculate the em ratio @xmath43 to study the variation of the total em : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent the dem of the lf and the pre - lf state ( i.e. , before the lf forms ) , respectively .",
    "the em ratio value @xmath43 is indicated in figure [ f11](b ) .",
    "it is evident that the em for the selected region increases up to @xmath113% when the lf appears .",
    "since the @xmath41 of lf and pre - lf are similar , this result strongly suggests that the brightening of the lf in euv passbands is due to enhanced plasma density at the edge of the expanding cme rather than the change of temperature . in other words ,",
    "the lf is a truly compression front , mainly the result of an enhancement in density . assuming that the depth of the lf along the line of sight approximates its height from the solar surface ( 165 mm ) , we find that the density increases from @xmath12.2 to 2.4 @xmath36 @xmath3 .",
    "note that , the estimated density is an upper limit , since the contribution from the background emission is included in the dem calculation .",
    "the dem distribution of the 2011 march 08 cme lf is similar to that of 2010 november 03 cme lf , with most emission coming from low temperatures : 6.0 @xmath24 6.4 ( figure [ f11](d ) ) .",
    "comparing with the pre - lf region , @xmath41 of the lf does not change but the dem temperature distribution broadens .",
    "some emission also appears at low temperature ( @xmath176.0 ) but this is less constrained ( figure [ f11](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "these changes result in the em increasing by @xmath13% and the density increasing from @xmath11.0 to 1.1 @xmath36 @xmath3 when the lf appears .    as for the 2011 march 07 cme lf , figure [ f11](f ) shows its dem result .",
    "the dem is poorly constrained in the range of 6.0 @xmath47 6.5 . for the selected region ,",
    "the average temperature slightly increases from @xmath381.7 mk to @xmath381.9 mk following the lf formation .",
    "the em is enhanced by @xmath176% and the density is increased to @xmath14.6 @xmath48 @xmath3 , compared to the pre - lf of @xmath13.5 @xmath48 @xmath3 ( figure [ f11](e ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these values carry a considerable uncertainty , given the large errors in the dem solutions .",
    "note that , all the density changes that we derive above include an additional uncertainty from the simple estimation of the lf s depth .",
    "moreover , the density change in the lf depends on sampled different regions , e.g. , near the nose or at the flank .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the percentage of the density increase is always less than 50% in our study , thus providing an upper limit .",
    "the dimming regions caused by 2010 november 03 , 2011 march 08 , and 2011 march 07 cmes are shown in figure [ f12 ] . to investigate the dem of the dimming regions",
    ", we avoid areas that include hot plasma , e.g. , the hot flux rope areas in the images .",
    "the selected dimming sub - regions are indicated by the boxes in figure [ f12 ] .",
    "we use the same method , comparing their dem distributions with the same region just before the dimming region appears ( pre - d ) .",
    "the results for the three events are shown in figure [ f13 ] .",
    "for the dimming on 2010 november 03 ( figure [ f13](b ) ) , the well - determined portion of the dem profile lies primarily in the range of 6.0 @xmath47 6.6 , and @xmath312.2 mk .",
    "the same region prior to the dimming has a very similar temperature , but the dem peak following the dimming decreases by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "the total em decreases by 57% ( figure [ f13](a ) and ( b ) ) . also assuming that the depth of the dimming along the line of sight is comparable to its height",
    ", we estimate that the density decreases from @xmath13.5 to 2.3 @xmath36 @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , the dem of 2011 march 08 dimming is centered around @xmath311.9 mk with temperatures spanning 6.1 @xmath47 6.4 .",
    "the total em decreases by @xmath163% and the density decreases to @xmath11.8 @xmath36 @xmath3 ( figure [ f13](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "these results also hold for the 2011 march 07 dimming ( figure [ f13](e ) and ( f ) ) , with the main dem distribution spanning from @xmath176.0 to @xmath176.8 , with @xmath41 at @xmath11.8 mk , with the decrease of em by 61% and of the density to @xmath17.5 @xmath48 @xmath3 .",
    "note that the dem reconstruction here is rather poorly constrained ; the errors vary by several orders of magnitude in most of temperature bins .",
    "low counts are the cause of the large uncertainties in the inferred dem .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude with high confidence that the dimming is mainly caused by the decrease of plasma density in the region .",
    "we summarize in table [ tb ] various properties of different cme structures , including average temperature , width of the dem curve at the 10% of peak value ( using a single gauss fitting to the dem curve ) , maximum dem , total em , and the density .",
    "the quantitative results from the dem analysis further support our previous result based on a qualitative argument : a cme consists of a high temperature flux rope and a cooler lf @xcite . by tracking the centroid of the flux rope in the 2010 november 03 event",
    ", we find that the dem - weighted temperature of the flux rope increases as it accelerates outward .",
    "observations of the curve - in of the flux rope legs , the shrinkage of the post - flare loops @xcite , and the presence of high energy hard x - ray sources surrounding the flux rope @xcite , taken together , argue that magnetic reconnection taking place in the current sheet underneath the flux rope is responsible for heating the plasma inside the flux rope to high temperature ( making it visible at 131  and 94  ) .",
    "a similar flux rope heating scenario was suggested by @xcite , who also attributed the heating to magnetic reconnection .",

    "therefore , during the magnetic reconnection , the cme flux rope is heated but the lf remains about the same temperature as the quiet coronal loops ( e.g. , t @xmath11.03.0 mk ; * ? ? ?",

    "in one case , the dem - weighted temperature even increases to @xmath110 mk as the flux rope rises up , probably due to the continuous magnetic reconnection .",
    "the presence of filament material within the magnetic dips of the flux rope can cause cooler _ apparent _ temperatures due to the mixture of hot and cold plasmas along the line - of - sight ( e.g. , 2011 march 07 event as shown in figure [ f4 ] ) .",

    "we can thus conclude that the brightening of the lfs largely due to the plasma compression at the cme front rather than the increase of the temperature .",
    "cool plasma ( 6.0 @xmath47 6.5 ) also dominates the emission in the dimming regions , again with no change in the dem - weighted average temperature .",

    "this process is iterated using levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization , until the predicted fluxes are close to the observed ones .",
    "the dem profile is interpolated using n-1 spline functions , representing the degrees of freedom for n different passband observations , which are directly manipulated by the well - known and much - tested  mpfit.pro \" routine from craig b. markwardt .    to assess the ability of  xrtdemiterative2.pro \" to reproduce dems , we have simulated aia observations with several input dem models , and then applied the forward - fitting routine to simulated aia data to derive the best - fit dem solutions .",
    "we then compared the reconstructed dems with input model dems , and explored uncertainties by computing 100 different mc realizations ( adding random noise within an uncertainty obtained by ",

    "the fluctuations of 100 mc solutions measure the confidence in the reconstructed dems ; typically , lower scatter in 100 mc solutions reflects smaller uncertainty in the reconstructed dem solution .",

    "we also discuss some specific representative cases in more detail .    in the single isothermal cases ( figure [ f14 ] ) , we find that in the temperature range of @xmath50=5.87.2 , the input temperature is successfully located , with only minor  spreading \" into adjacent temperature bins .",
    "since the input delta function dem is fitted with splines , some em  spillage \" is to be expected , and the results are still quite good .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the recovered dem in this @xmath51 range is equal to 0.2 everywhere , but increases to 0.4 for @xmath50 out of this range .    in the double isothermal cases ( figure [ f15 ] ) , we find that the fit ems again always show some spread around the input temperatures @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the fwhm tends to be larger ( @xmath54 ) .",

    "similar to the single gaussian cases , with @xmath63 in the range of 5.77.3 , any @xmath55 separation , and @xmath64 , the best fitted dems recover the double gaussian dems profiles successfully ( figure [ f17 ] ) .",
    "the metrics of the goodness - of - fit for model dems are shown in table [ tb3 ] .",

    "the normalized error @xmath67 , the linear correlation coefficient @xmath68 , the @xmath69 increases to be 40.75 for the case d of figure [ f17 ] , for example .",
    "finally , the chianti active region dem  activeregionoso6.dem \" is accurately reproduced across the entire temperature range with quite good accuracy ( figure [ f18 ] ) .",
    "the normalized error @xmath70 , the linear correlation coefficient @xmath71 , and the chi - squared statistic @xmath72 . therefore ,",
