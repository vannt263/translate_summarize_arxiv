    "it has been known for quite some time that the statistical properties of galaxies are closely related to their surrounding environments .",
    "much of previous environment - related work focused on the relationship between morphology and environment ( e.g. , @xcite ; or the more recent work of @xcite ) .",
    "all these works find that bulge - dominated galaxies are more strongly clustered than disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "since spectroscopic and photometric properties of galaxies are strongly correlated with morphology , it is not surprising to find that the spectroscopic and photometric properties of galaxies are also functions of environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    since regions of the universe with different densities evolve at different rates , we expect these environment dependencies to contain crucial information about galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "considering that all of the observed statistical properties of galaxies appear to be interdependent , it is important to ask which properties are correlated with environment independently of the others ; i.e. , which environment relationships are fundamental and which ones are merely the products of other relations .",
    "@xcite found that , out of color , luminosity , surface brightness , and radial concentration , the color and luminosity of a galaxy appear to be the only properties that are directly related to the local overdensity .",
    "surface brightness and concentration appear to be related to the environment only through their relationships with color and luminosity .",
    "the main limitations in this study were caused by their environment indicator , local overdensity , since it has relatively low signal - to - noise and it can not resolve scales smaller than @xmath1mpc . in a similar study ,",
    "@xcite used the clustocentric distance as an environment indicator found that there is a residual dependence of ongoing star formation on environment among galaxies of similar morphology , stellar mass , and mean stellar age .",
    "this study was limited by a relatively small sample size ( 1,637 galaxies in 6 clusters ) as well as by the star formation indicator , oii , which is sensitive to dust and metallicity .    in this short paper , we build upon previous studies in several ways .",
    "we conduct a study similar to @xcite , except that we use the clustocentric distance as our environment indicator . the clustocentric distance  the distance to the nearest galaxy cluster center  is a fundamental and precisely measurable environment indicator ; indeed it can be measured at much higher signal - to - noise than estimates of overdensity on fixed scales .",
    "thus , we probe the findings of @xcite on much smaller scales and at much higher signal - to - noise .",
    "we use the @xcite cluster catalog that was created with an algorithm that made no use of galaxy colors , so our galaxy colors are unbiased even in the cluster cores .",
    "the cluster catalog was designed to recover groups of galaxies that are bound in the same underlying dark matter halo . in order to determine whether our results can be easily understood within our current understanding of galaxy formation and evolution",
    ", we compare our observational results from the sloan digital sky survey to analogous results from the semi - analytic millennium simulation of galaxy formation @xcite .    in",

    "they are @xmath8 corrected to the redshift @xmath9 observed bandpasses so they can be directly compared to the rest - frame sdss @xmath5 outputs of the millennium simulation @xcite .    for the purposes of computing large - scale structure statistics , we have assembled a complete subsample of sdss galaxies known as the nyu lss `",
    "sample14 ` .",
    "this subsample is described elsewhere @xcite ; it is selected to have a well - defined window function and magnitude limit .",
    "in addition , the galaxies in the sample used here were selected to have apparent magnitudes in the range @xmath10 , redshift in the range @xmath11 , and absolute magnitude @xmath12 .",
    "these cuts left 52,485 galaxies .",
    "a seeing - convolved srsic model is fit to the azimuthally averaged radial profile of every galaxy in the observed - frame @xmath13 band , as described elsewhere @xcite .",

    "the profile is exponential , and at @xmath19 the profile is de  vaucouleurs . in the fits shown here , values in the range @xmath20",
    "were allowed .    to every best - fit srsic profile",
    ", the @xcite photometry technique is applied , with the same parameters as used in the sdss survey .",
    "this supplies seeing - corrected petrosian magnitudes and radii .",
    "a @xmath8-corrected surface - brightness @xmath21 in the @xmath22 band is computed by dividing half the @xmath8-corrected petrosian light by the area of the petrosian half - light circle .",
    "the @xmath0  line flux is measured in a 20    width interval centered on the line . before the flux is computed ,",
    "a best - fit model consisting of scaled old - galaxy and a - star spectra @xcite is scaled to have the same flux continuum as the data in the vicinity of the emission line and subtracted to leave a continuum - subtracted line spectrum .",
    "this method fairly accurately models the @xmath0absorption trough in the continuum , although in detail it leaves small negative residuals .",
    "the flux is converted to a rest - frame ew with a continuum found by taking the inverse - variance - weighted average of two sections of the spectrum about 150    in size and on either side of the emission line .",
    "further details are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a caveat to this analysis is that the 3  arcsec diameter spectroscopic fibers of the sdss spectrographs do not obtain all of each galaxy s light because at redshifts of @xmath11 they represent apertures of between @xmath23 and @xmath24 diameter .",
    "consequently the integrity of our @xmath0  ew measurement is a function of galaxy size , inclination , and morphology .",
    "we have looked at variations in our @xmath0  ew results as a function of redshift and found that the quantitative results differ but our qualitative results remain the same .",
    "we use the group and cluster catalog described in @xcite .",
    "the catalog is obtained from a volume - limited sample of galaxies that is complete down to an @xmath25 band absolute magnitude of @xmath26  mag and goes out to a redshift of 0.068 .",
    "groups are identified using a friends - of - friends algorithm ( see e.g. , geller & huchra 1983 ; davis et al 1985 ) with perpendicular and line - of - sight linking lengths equal to 0.14 and 0.75 times the mean inter - galaxy separation , respectively .",
    "these parameters were chosen with the help of mock galaxy catalogs to produce galaxy groups that most closely resemble galaxy systems that occupy the same dark matter halos .",
    "the resulting catalog contains 985 systems of richness @xmath27 galaxies with an r - band absolute magnitude limit of @xmath26  mag . for consistency",

    "they assign a virial halo mass to each cluster luminosity .",
    "the masses derived in this way ignore the scatter in mass at fixed cluster luminosity and are only meant to be approximate .",
    "the median mass estimate for the clusters used here is @xmath28 solar masses .",
    "each cluster has an associated `` virial radius '' of @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the estimated mass of the cluster and @xmath31 is the current mean density of the universe . by this method ,",
    "the median estimated virial radius for the clusters used here is @xmath1  mpc . note that this method for determination of the virial radii is very different from that employed by other investigators .",
    "some have used a quasi - empirical formula based on velocity dispersion @xcite , others have assumed that cluster mass is directly proportional to richness @xcite ; in general these methods differ substantially , and produce cluster catalogs with very different mass functions .",
    "we use the cluster centers given by @xcite , which are computed as the mean of the member galaxy positions .",
    "we then calculate the transverse projected clustocentric distance @xmath32  from each galaxy to its nearest cluster center on the sky within @xmath33 in radial velocity .      to better understand our observations , we do a similar analysis for the millennium simulation galaxy catalog .",
    "the millennium simulation is a large cosmological n - body simulation of @xmath34 dark matter particles in a @xmath35 box .",
    "the formation of galaxies is simulated by using a semi - analytical model whose parameters and assumptions are tweaked in order to reproduce the joint luminosity - color , morphology , gas mass , and central black hole mass distributions of low - redshift galaxies . for a more detailed description ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the publicly available output of this simulation @xcite is a catalog of @xmath36 million galaxies that contains positions , velocities , bulge and total sdss - band magnitudes , bulge and total masses , gas masses ( cold , hot , and ejected ) , black hole masses , and star formation rates .    from this catalog",
    "we use the ratio of bulge - to - total luminosity as a morphology indicator .",
    "this @xmath37 value is an analog to our observed concentration and surface brightness .",
    "similarly , we use the star formation rate sfr and sdss - band @xmath38 $ ] color from this catalog as star - formation history indicators ; these are analogs to our @xmath0  ew and @xmath38 $ ] color measurements , respectively .    before running the cluster - finding algorithm @xcite",
    ", we distort the millennium coordinates to mimic redshift - space distortions by changing the output coordinates of each galaxy from @xmath39 $ ] to @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "we then run the same friends - of - friends algorithm that we did on the data , using the perpendicular linking length in the @xmath41 and @xmath42directions and the line - of - sight linking length in the @xmath43-direction . after creating this cluster catalog",
    "we calculate each galaxy s clustocentric distance using a similar algorithm we use on the data : we calculate the transverse projected clustocentric distance @xmath32  from each galaxy to its nearest cluster center on the @xmath44 plane within @xmath45 in the @xmath43-direction .",
    "figure  [ fig : n_dont_matter ] shows how radial concentration and color relate to clustocentric distance within narrow subsamples of each other . for the @xmath46  grid on the left , the top - left panel shows how the 5 , 25 , 50 ( in bold ) , 75 , and 95 percentiles of the concentration distribution vary with clustocentric distance for the entire sample .",
    "the color distribution for the entire sample is shown in the right panel .",
    "the gradient in the concentration percentiles show that galaxies with small clustocentric distances tend to be more concentrated .",
    "the subsequent rows show the same relation but for narrow color subsamples whose color distribution is shown in the right panels .",
    "notice the gradient seen in the top panel nearly vanishes for the narrow color subsamples below .",
    "the absence of a concentration gradient for these subsamples shows that at fixed color , there is no dependence of concentration on environment .",
    "the right @xmath46  grid shows the same plot but with concentration and color interchanged . notice that a color gradient remains when looking at narrow concentration subsamples .",
    "this shows that at fixed concentration , there _ is _ a residual dependence of color on environment .",
    "the asymmetry seen in this figure is also seen in figure  [ fig : mu_dont_matter ] which uses surface brightness , instead of concentration , as a morphology tracer . this asymmetry is the principal result of this paper .",
    "this asymmetry is similar to that found by @xcite , but it appears here at much higher significance and over a larger dynamic range .",
    "figure  [ fig : ha_matter ] also shows the same asymmetry shown in figure  [ fig : n_dont_matter ] but using @xmath0  ew , instead of color , as our star - formation - history parameter . note that the right @xmath46  grid agrees with the findings of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : meanplots ] displays the asymmetry shown in figure  [ fig : n_dont_matter ] in a different way . the left panel shows that out of color and clustocentric distance , concentration depends only on color since the mean concentration contours are perpendicular to the color axis . the center panel shows that color depends on both concentration and clustocentric distance .",
    "the right panel shows that clustocentric distance depends more on color than concentration , since the contours are nearly perpendicular to the color axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : n_dont_matter_mil ] is analogous to figure  [ fig : n_dont_matter ] but showing the redshift zero outputs from the millennium simulation . instead of concentration @xmath17",
    "we show the ratio of bulge luminosity to the total luminosity @xmath37 .",
    "notice that the asymmetry seen in the observed data is not reproduced here .",
    "the asymetry is also absent when we replace color with star - formation rate .",
    "figure  [ fig : btsig_n_dont_matter_mil ] is the same as figure  [ fig : n_dont_matter_mil ] but with 30 percent random errors added to the @xmath37 values .",
    "the `` random errors '' were produced by randomly adding a gaussian distribution with a dispursion of @xmath47 to the millennium @xmath37 values .",
    "notice that the behavior of the trends do not significantly change when adding these large errors to @xmath37 .",
    "this figure suggests that the asymmetry observed in the sdss data is not due to the fact that we measure star - formation histories with much higher precision than we measure morphologies .",
    "another interesting result from figures  1 - 3 is that the dependence of star - formation - history and morphological parameters on clustocentric distance is mostly limited to within the cluster virial radius .",
    "the top - left panels of these figures show that the trends observed at distances of less than the virial radius ( denoted by the vertical dashed lines ) nearly disappear at larger radii , where the relations between star - formation / morphological parameters and clustocentric distance are mostly flat .",
    "this result is not reproduced by the millenium semi - analytic model .",
    "the top - left panels of figure  [ fig : n_dont_matter_mil ] show that , though the relations between model galaxy parameters and clustocentric radius flatten out near the virial radius , the strong trends resume at larger radii .",
    "using a complete sample of 52,485 galaxies in the redshift range of @xmath11 we examine how star - formation history parameters@xmath38 $ ] color and @xmath0  ew  and morphology parameters  radial concentration @xmath17 and surface brightness @xmath21relate to environment .",
    "we use the transverse projected distance to the nearest cluster  the clustocentric distance @xmath32as our environment parameter .",
    "similar to @xcite , we find that our morphology tracers ( concentration and surface brightness ) appear to be related to environment ( @xmath32 in this case ) only indirectly through their relationships with the star - formation history tracers .",
    "this suggests that the well known morphology  environment relation is a result of the star - formation - history ",
    "environment relation .",
    "we note that , although our simple morphology indicators do not show direct dependence on clustocentric distance , this result does not disagree with that the original morphology  density studies @xcite because these studies did not attempt to separate morphological and star - formation dependences .",
    "our results also do not disagree with previous work @xcite which suggests that gas stripping plays a significant role in the morphological transformation and rapid truncation of star formation by showing asymmetries in hi and @xmath0  flux on the leading edge of infalling spiral galaxies .",
    "there is no disagreement because our very blunt morphology indicators are insensitive to those asymmetries , and the asymmetries are only visible in a small fraction of all cluster galaxies .",
    "where our results overlap those of previous investigators @xcite , we mostly find good agreement .",
    "in particular , we find that galaxy properties depend on clustocentric distance in much the same way as they do on other environmental indicators @xcite .",
    "our result improves on this previous one because the clustocentric distance is measured at much higher signal - to - noise and probes environments on scales much smaller than local overdensity measurements .",
    "our results improve on the findings of @xcite by reproducing their result with far higher signal to noise and by also by examining the inverse of their study .",
    "they found that star formation rate is related to environment independently of morphology .",
    "we find that both color and star formation rate behave in this way as well as that morphology does nt have a dependence on environment independent of star - formation history .",
    "it is worth noting that this asymmetry may , in principle , be attributed to the _ measurements _ that were made instead of the properties of galaxies .",
    "this is possible because our star - formation - history properties are measured with far higher precision than our morphology properties .",
    "however , we do not believe this is true for two main reasons ; _ ( 1 ) _ when we add large asymmetric noise to the millennium bulge - to - total luminosities we still find no clear asymmetry and _ ( 2 ) _ the fact that we observe this asymmetry regardless of which star - formation history and morphology tracers we use , strongly suggests that it is a description of galaxy properties themselves . we stress that our main result , that there is no direct morphology  environment relation , holds for morphology defined by concentration and surface brightness . it remains untested whether other characterizations of morphology , such as spiral structure or asymmetry in the shape of the light distribution , also show this trait .",
    "our results also show that , where there are trends between galaxy properties and clustocentric distance , these trends are primarily restricted to within the cluster virial radii .",
    "this suggests that environmental processes that affect galaxy properties are fairly local ( i.e. , within the dark matter halo ) and do not `` act at a distance '' .",
    "these results are not in agreement with those of @xcite and @xcite who found that there are trends out to @xmath48 times the virial radius .",
    "the discrepancy can be attributed to our different ways of estimating cluster virial radii .",
    "these authors use the @xcite approximation relating virial radius to velocity dispersion , whereas we use virial radii based on the @xcite mass estimates , which are derived from cluster abundances .",
    "we have checked the @xcite approximation on our clusters and find that it yields virial radii that are @xmath49 times smaller than the ones we use , which explains much of the discrepancy .",
    "we trust our mass estimates because they are based on abundances , which have been shown to be unbiased for our clusters @xcite .",
    "masses based on the @xcite approximation yield an incorrect cluster mass function .    the asymmetry that we see between star - formation and morphological parameters has interesting implications for the role that environment plays in shaping galaxy properties .",
    "our results suggest that environmental processes can affect galaxy star - formation histories without simultaneously affecting morphology , but in cases where an environmental mechanism does affect galaxy morphology , it must also affect star - formation history .",
    "another possible explanation is that environment affects both star - formation history and morphology , but the changes in star - formation history occur on a much more rapid timescale than the corresponding changes to morphology .    in this short paper , we have investigated how galaxy star - formation histories and morphologies depend on environment .",
    "we find the following asymmetry : at fixed color , there is no dependence of morphology on environment , while at fixed morphology , there is a residual dependence of color on environment .",
    "this result suggests that the morphology  environment relation is a result of the combination of the star - formation - history ",
    "environment and the morphology  star - formation - history relations .",
    "moreover , we performed a similar analysis on a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation and find that this asymmetry is not reproduced .",
    "our results have important implications for the role that environment plays in shaping galaxy star - formation histories and morphology , and they place strong constraints on models of galaxy formation .",
