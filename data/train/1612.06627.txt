    "<S> the coulomb drag phenomenon in a coulomb - coupled double quantum dot system is revisited with a minimal model . </S>",

    "<S> , we consider the case of very large coulomb interaction between the dots , whereby the drag current is only driven by cotunneling events . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> a purely quantum coherent drag effect takes place . </S>",
    "<S> further , we demonstrate that by properly engineering the tunneling probabilities using band tailoring it is possible to control the sign of the drag and drive currents , allowing them to flow in parallel or antiparallel directions . </S>",
    "<S> we also report an additional control over the sign of the drag current that can be achieved by varying the drag gate potential .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction.__in a system made of two nearby ( electrically ) isolated conductors where particles are prevented from tunneling into each other , a bias drop through one conductor can drag a current through the other conductor due to coulomb interaction between them @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb drag effect was first suggested by pogrebinskii @xcite and price @xcite theoretically and explained by energy and momentum transfer from the drive conductor to the drag conductor due to coulomb mutual friction . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon has become a quite useful toolbox to probe electron - electron or electron - hole scattering mechanisms in many - body systems . at the early stage </S>",
    "<S> , the effect has been observed in semiconductor 2d-3d electron gas layers @xcite , 2d-2d electron gas layers @xcite , 2d electron gas-2d hole gas layers @xcite and then investigated under the influence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the coulomb interaction is stronger in 1d than 2d , coulomb drag between 1d-1d quantum nanowires has been also extensively explored @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , interest has shifted to more exotic systems such as graphene double layers @xcite , graphene double ribbons @xcite , graphene-2d electron gases @xcite , or double bilayer graphene heterostructures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , coulomb drag between quantum wire and quantum dot @xcite , between quantum dots @xcite , or between quantum point contacts @xcite has been demonstrated . in such systems </S>",
    "<S> translational symmetry is broken . </S>",
    "<S> hence , coulomb drag effect assisted by momentum transfer is no longer possible and only energy transfer between the two subsystems takes place . </S>",
    "<S> energy exchange between the drive and drag subsystems leads to rectification of nonequilibrium fluctuations  @xcite in close analogy to the ratchet effect  @xcite with possible energy harvesting applications  @xcite .    reducing the dimensionality of nanoscale devices </S>",
    "<S> has a two - fold advantage , namely : ( i ) the coulomb interaction enhances by diminishing the system size system , which leads to a major dragging effect ; ( ii ) a very small drive voltage yields a drag current generated by the excess of noise of the drive system </S>",
    "<S> . both properties may play significant roles in quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> enhanced coulomb interaction can entangle particles in a controlled way while drag currents can be used for quantum measurement purposes , where the drag subsystem serves as the detector . in this </S>",

    "<S> these systems exhibit quantum coherence . here </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that quantum coherence is crucial in the strongly interacting mesoscopic coulomb drag effect .    </S>",
    "<S> reference   proposes a simple mesoscopic setup that consists of two parallel coulomb - coupled quantum dots attached to four separate normal electron reservoirs to generate the coulomb drag current . </S>",
    "<S> using this device , it is possible to test fundamental fluctuation relations among nonlinear transport coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> both quantum dots are very closely spaced so that a very strong interdot coulomb interaction is expected and the setup is thus a natural platform to observe coulomb drag . </S>",
    "<S> interdot tunneling is forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> the setup is analyzed employing the master equation approach , considering only sequential tunneling rates . </S>",
    "<S> dot charge - state dependent tunnel barriers are key ingredients in the prediction of unidirectional drag currents , independently of the direction of the drive bias drop . a recent experiment @xcite realizes the setup using a lithographically patterned algaas / gaas heterostructure and detects unidirectional drag currents as anticipated . </S>",
    "<S> however and in contrast to the theory of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the experiment shows at very low temperatures the importance of including cotunneling processes , as demonstrated with a theoretical model that shows excellent agreement with the experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of cotunneling processes is also emphasized in ref .   where a similar system is considered but with graphene reservoirs instead of normal electron reservoirs  @xcite . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> a four - charge state model within a master equation description serves as a theoretical basis to describe the coulomb drag effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is proven that nonlocal cotunneling processes contribute to the drag current to the same order as sequential tunneling events , the former being the main contribution when the dot level for the drag subsystem lies well far away from the resonant condition . </S>",
    "<S> in such situation , the drag current is mainly driven by high - order tunneling processes . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , both analyses also had to take into account sequential processes for a proper description of the drag effect .    </S>",
    "<S> our aim here is to propose a minimal model that totally suppresses sequential tunneling drag currents , leading to a drag effect mainly driven by cotunneling processes . in our setup , </S>",
    "<S> the mutual coulomb interaction is considered to be sufficiently large to discard the double occupation charge state . </S>",

    "<S> the system consists of two parallel quantum dots which are connected electrostatically with an infinite interdot coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> a clever design for the reservoir density of states leads to a powerful tunability for the drive and drag currents . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we illustrated our findings with a model in which the left top coupling has a lorentzian density profile and the other couplings are constant . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that the drag current flows in parallel or in opposite direction when compared with the drive current by reversing the sign of the bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> further , the drag current changes its sign when the dot energy level is varied with an external gate potential . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with the results for finite charging energy models @xcite in which the drag current is unidirectional independently of the value of the drive bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal opens a new route for the detection and manipulation of coherent drag currents in nanoscale conductors .    _ </S>",
