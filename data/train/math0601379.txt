    "in this paper we show how to solve the inverse problem for ifsm in the case of trajectories of stochastic processes in @xmath0 .",
    "the method is based on the solution of the inverse problem for ifsm due to forte and vrscay @xcite .",
    "this is an extension of classical ifs methods which can be used for approximating a given element of @xmath1 thus in particular trajectories of stochastic processes on this space .",
    "the final goal of this approach is simulation . indeed ,",
    "several methods are currently available to simulate paths of stochastic processes and in particular of the brownian motion .",
    "paths of the bm can be simulated using the properties of the increments of the process like in the euler scheme @xcite , or as the limit of a random walk or via @xmath0 decomposition like the kac - siegert / karnounen - loeve series @xcite . in this paper",
    "we first propose a ifsm ( iterated function systems with maps ) operator whose fixed point is the trajectory of the bm .",
    "we then use this representation of the process to simulate its trajectories .",
    "the resulting simulated trajectories are self - affine , continuous and fractal by construction .",
    "this fact produces more realistic trajectories than other schemes in the sense that their geometry is closer to the one of the true bm s trajectories .",
    "the ifsm trajectory of the bm can then be used to generate more realistic solutions of stochastic differential equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : ifsm ] recalls the theory of ifsm on @xmath0 , section [ sec : l2 ] recalls some details for stochastic processes with trajectories in @xmath0 and the link with the ifsm theory .",
    "section [ sec : bm ] presents the application of the ifsm theory to the problem of simulation with particular attention to the case of the brownian motion .",
    "the basic idea of iterated function systems ( ifs ) can be traced back to some historical papers but the use of such systems to construct fractals and other similar sets was first described by hutchinson ( 1981 ) .",
    "the fundamental result on which the ifs method is based is banach theorem .",
    "the mathematical context is the following : given @xmath2 in a complete metric space @xmath3 , find a contractive operator @xmath4 that admits a unique fixed point @xmath5 such that @xmath6 is small enough .",
    "in fact if one is able to solve _ the inverse problem _ with arbitrary precision , it is possible to identify @xmath2 with the operator @xmath7 which has it as fixed point .",
    "the fundamental theorems on which the ifs method is based on are the following :    ( banach theorem ) let @xmath8 be a complete metric space ; suppose there exists a mapping @xmath4 such that @xmath9 for all @xmath10 and some @xmath11 .",

    "the operator @xmath7 corresponding to the @xmath36 map ifsm(@xmath40,@xmath41 ) is @xmath42 where the prime means that the sum operates on all those terms for which @xmath43 ( the inverse function of @xmath44 ) is defined .",
