    "this divergence , however , is unphysical , being an artifact of the semiclassical approximation .",

    "in order to show how one can improve the semiclassical approximation so as to eliminate the unphysical divergences at the caustics , it is convenient to recall how ( [ sc ] ) is derived .",

    "( [ u ] ) ] the smallest even integer such that the coefficient of @xmath40 in @xmath41 is positive for all values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; this suffices to make the integral in ( [ calf ] ) finite even when @xmath34 vanishes ; ( ii ) the factor @xmath42 in @xmath43 cancels the factor @xmath44 contained in @xmath45 ; combined with ( i ) , this shows that the improved approximation to @xmath46 , eq .",
    "( [ unif ] ) , is finite at the caustics ; ( iii ) there is a one - to - one correspondence between the minima of @xmath9 $ ] and the minima of @xmath41 ; therefore , it is not necessary to explicitly add their contributions as in ( [ sc ] ) , for they are already contained in @xmath43 .",
    "although the procedure outlined above teaches us how to cross the caustics , it is not very convenient : in order to obtain the coefficients of @xmath41 one has to find @xmath34 and @xmath47 .",
    "this , in general , is not an easy task , and makes the whole procedure very cumbersome .",

    "let us assume it has three ( real ) extrema : a global minimum at @xmath51 , a local maximum at @xmath52 , and a local minimum at @xmath53 .",

    "fortunately , @xmath43 does not depend on it . indeed , identifying @xmath68 with @xmath41 yields @xmath69 , which allows us to rewrite ( [ calf ] ) solely in terms of @xmath64 and @xmath65 : @xmath70    the discussion above",
