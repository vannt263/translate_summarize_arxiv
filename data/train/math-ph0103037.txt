    "the motivation for the study of zeros of random polynomials and random analytic functions comes from different applications , most importantly from the theory of quantum chaos ( see papers of bogomolny , bohigas , and leboeuf @xcite , leboeuf and shukla @xcite , hannay @xcite , korsch , miller , and wiescher @xcite , nonnenmacher and voros @xcite , forrester and honner @xcite , leboeuf @xcite , shiffman and zelditch @xcite , and others ) .",

    "the distribution of joint zeros of @xmath17 independent copies of the @xmath21 random polynomial is invariant with respect to the action of the group @xmath21 on the complex projective space @xmath23 .",
