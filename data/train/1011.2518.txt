    "the energy production and nucleosynthesis in stars is characterized by nuclear reaction sequences which determine the subsequent phases of stellar evolution .",
    "energy production during the first hydrogen burning phase takes place through the fusion of four protons into helium .",
    "this occurs either through the pp - chains or the cno cycles .",
    "the pp - chains dominate hydrogen burning in first generation stars with primordial abundance distributions and in low mass , m@xmath61.5 m@xmath7 , stars .",
    "the cno cycles dominate the energy production in more massive , m@xmath81.5 m@xmath7 , second or later generation stars with an appreciable abundance of cno isotopes .",
    "the cno cycles are characterized by sequences of radiative capture reactions and @xmath9-decay processes as shown in figure  @xcite .        at stellar temperatures",
    "the @xmath10n(p,@xmath1)@xmath0o reaction is the slowest process in the cycle , defining the time scale and the overall energy production rate  @xcite .",
    "this reaction is therefore of importance for the interpretation of cno burning .",
    "the proton capture by @xmath0n is relevant since it is a branch point linking the first cno or cn cycle with the second cno , or no cycle as shown in figure  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "this branching has always been a matter of debate since both reactions are characterized by strong low energy resonances .",
    "the reaction rate of @xmath0n(p,@xmath11)@xmath12c is determined by two broad low energy s - wave resonances at e@xmath4 = 338 kev and 1028 kev , populating the j@xmath13 = 1@xmath14 states at 12.44 and 13.09 mev , respectively , in the @xmath2o compound nucleus .",
    "there have been a number of low energy measurements  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite which provide the basis of the present rate in the literature  @xcite .",
    "recently , three lower energy points were derived from an indirect  trojan horse method ( thm ) \"  @xcite which are consistent with low energy data  @xcite .",
    "the competing @xmath0n(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction decays predominately to the ground state of @xmath2o and exhibits the same two resonances but in addition is expected to have a strong non - resonant direct capture component  @xcite .",
    "the presently available low energy cross section data from  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite differ substantially at lower energies .",
    "this poses difficulties for a reliable extrapolation of the cross section towards the stellar energy range .",
    "an extrapolation was performed  @xcite using a two level breit - wigner formalism taking into account the direct capture contribution .",
    "the present reaction rate for @xmath0n(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o  @xcite relies entirely on the predictions of  @xcite .    to reduce the uncertainty in the strength of the direct capture term single - particle transfer reactions",

    "this experiment was performed using a windowless differentially pumped gas target with natural nitrogen gas . for detecting the @xmath1-ray signal , a large bgo scintillator detector was used to observe the characteristic @xmath1 decay in summing mode  @xcite . since the natural abundance of @xmath0n is low , the yield of the @xmath0n(p,@xmath1 ) signal was weak and",
    "overshadowed by beam induced background yield from proton capture reactions on target impurities and from the @xmath10n(p,@xmath1 ) reaction .",
    "the measurements were therefore limited to energies below 230 kev .",
    "the proposed cross section results are clearly lower than the values obtained by  @xcite but also slightly lower than the results of  @xcite and  @xcite . given the strong background conditions , the results could not be normalized to the known on - resonance yield at 338 kev and systematic errors in the data can not be excluded .",
    "because of the inconsistencies in the existing data and the uncertainties of an r - matrix analysis based on these existing data , we have performed a new study of the @xmath0n(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o over a wide energy range using high resolution ge detectors . in the following section the experimental approach at the notre dame nuclear science laboratory ( nsl ) and the luna ii facility at the gran sasso underground laboratory will be discussed .",
    "this will be followed by a discussion of the experimental data . in the last section",
    "the stellar nuclear reaction rate based on the present data will be calculated and compared with existing results .",

    "the energy of the this machine was calibrated using the well known @xmath0n(p,@xmath19)@xmath12c resonance at 429 kev  @xcite .",
    "the luna ii facility  @xcite , located in the gran sasso national laboratory , uses a high current 400 kv , cockroft- walton type accelerator .",
    "the accelerator provided proton beam currents on target of up to 200 @xmath18a in the energy range of 130 to 400 kev .",
    "in addition to the high beam output , the accelerator is extremely stable , and the voltage is known with an accuracy of about 300 ev .",
    "the experimental setup in both experiments was very similar .",
    "the targets were water cooled and mounted at 45@xmath22 with respect to the beam direction . at notre dame the position of the beam on the target was defined by a set of vertical and horizontal slits . the beam was swept horizontally and vertically across a target area of 1 @xmath23 by steerers in order to dissipate power over a large target area . at luna",
    "the ion beam optics provided a de - focused beam on target and no beam sweeping was applied . to avoid the build - up of impurities on the target a cu finger , cooled to ln@xmath24 temperatures , was placed along the inside of the beamline extending as close to the target as possible . in addition ,",
    "a bias voltage of about -400 v was applied to the isolated cold finger to suppress the secondary electrons ejected from the target due to proton bombardment .",
    "the ti@xmath0n targets were fabricated at the forschungszentrum karlsruhe by reactive sputtering of ti in a nitrogen atmosphere enriched in @xmath0n to 99.95% .",

    "for the thick target used at luna , @xmath10n and @xmath0n enrichment of 17.4 @xmath27 2.0% and 82.6 @xmath27 2.0% were found , respectively , most likely caused by a contamination of the enriched gas during sputtering .",
    "the thicknesses of all tin targets were measured using the narrow @xmath0n(p,@xmath19)@xmath12c resonance at 429 kev  @xcite . the target used at notre dame had a thickness of 7.2 @xmath27 0.3 kev at e@xmath4 = 429 kev and the two targets used at luna had thicknesses of 9.5 @xmath27 0.4 kev and 24.8 @xmath27 0.5 kev at 429 kev , respectively .",
    "the stability of the notre dame targets was checked continuously during the course of the experiment using the @xmath0n(p,@xmath19)@xmath12c resonance .",
    "the thin luna target was monitored by rescanning the top of the 338 kev resonance in @xmath0n(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o .",
    "the thick luna target could also be monitored using the @xmath10n(p,@xmath1)@xmath0o resonance at e@xmath4 = 278 kev because of the large @xmath10n content ( 17% ) of this target .",
    "because of the relatively low power density delivered at notre dame , the target saw virtually no degradation over the experiment with an accumulated charge of 5 c ( see figure  [ fig:430kev_scans ] ) and no yield corrections were necessary . during the luna experiment with significantly higher beam currents , the thickness of the thin target",
    "was reduced by 27@xmath25 after an accumulated charge of 17 c and that of the thick target by 30@xmath25 after an accumulated charge of 65 c ( see figure  [ fig : luna_target_scans ] ) .",

    "squares represent the initial target scan , while down triangles represent the scan after 65 c on target [ fig : luna_target_scans ] ]      at the nsl , the @xmath1-rays were observed using a hpge clover detector , which consists of four hpge crystals contained in the same cryostat .",
    "this unique arrangement allows the separate detectors to be used in so called add - back mode  @xcite . at luna , a single crystal , 115% hpge detector from bochum , germany was used for the detection of @xmath1-rays .",

    "the @xmath0n(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o ground state transition @xmath1-ray peak is indicated in each spectrum with an arrow.[fig : sample_specta ] ]    the primary advantage of the luna ii facility is the low background environment created by the rock cover from the gran sasso mountains .",

    "the detectors were set up at an angle of 45@xmath22 with respect to the beam direction , allowing the position of the detector to be set as close as possible to the reaction position .",
    "the relative efficiency of the @xmath1-ray detector systems was measured using radioactive sources along with well known capture @xmath1 reactions . at notre dame",
    "the relative efficiencies for high energy @xmath1-rays were established using the @xmath20al(p,@xmath1)@xmath21si resonances at 992 kev  @xcite and 1183 kev  @xcite and the @xmath29na(p,@xmath1)@xmath30 mg resonance at 1318 kev  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath31b resonance has a small angular distribution  @xcite , and the correction for the relative intensity is less than 3% .    while summing is not of concern for the ground state transition of the @xmath0n(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction itself , summing plays a significant role in the determination of the @xmath1-efficiency .",
    "for this reason the efficiency measurements at both laboratories were carried out at several different detector - target distances and the data were simultaneously fitted for all distances following the procedure described by imbriani et al .",

    "this reduces to the well known thin target yield equation if the cross section is constant over the target thickness , f(e)=1 .",
