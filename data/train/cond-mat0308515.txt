    "in statistical mechanics a notion of duality appeared first as a relation between the high- and low - temperature expansions in the two - dimensional ising model  @xcite . in both expansions the partition function",
    "can be expressed as a sum on a gas of closed polymers : in the low - temperature picture , these polymers are the boundaries of the ferromagnetic domains , so we have an expansion in the deviations from the ordered regime ; on the contrary , in the high - temperature picture the polymers are the terms of a fourier expansion which expresses the deviation from a disordered regime of total decorrelation .",
    "so , in a certain sense , the duality relates _ energetic _ degrees of freedom to _ entropic _ degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , under the assumption of the existence of only one critical value for the temperature , it was possible to locate the phase - transition point before the exact solution of the model by onsager .    more formally , a duality transformation can be defined directly on the partition function of the model by means of two independent duality transformations , that is :    * the variables are located on the @xmath1-cells of a @xmath2 dimensional cell - complex ( e.g.  the @xmath3-cells , or _ sites _ , for a spin model , the @xmath4-cells , or _",
    "bonds _ , for a gauge model ) , more precisely the physical state is a @xmath1-cochain taking values in an abelian group .",
    "the interactions are located on the @xmath5-cells ( respectively the _ bonds _ and the _ plaquettes _ in the previous examples ) .",
    "the `` algebraic '' duality exchanges variables and interactions , and the dual physical state is a @xmath5-chain on the dual of the original group . *",
    "the new variables have a gauge redundancy , and must obey a set of constraints : in other words , they must be a closed @xmath5-chain .",
    "the solution of the constraints leads to the `` integration '' of the @xmath5-chain to a @xmath6-chain .",
    "after this , the cell - complex on which the model is defined is transformed into its dual counterpart .",
    "this `` geometrical '' duality of cellular complexes pictorially exchanges @xmath1-cells with @xmath7-cells , and the physical state is now a @xmath8-cochain .",
    "this is the general strategy , explained in detail , for example , in the review part of @xcite , or in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we wish to clarify the first ( `` algebraic '' ) part of the duality transformation , by putting it in a more general context .",
    "we consider a rather general class of statistical - mechanical models in which the variables take values in an abelian group ; each interaction term is associated to a particular linear combination of variables , but need not arise from any particular geometrical entity ( such as a bond or a plaquette ) . by relaxing the requirement for a cell - complex structure , we can deal with a wider class of statistical models .",
    "we think that this more general notion of duality can be fruitful in the study of disordered systems .",
    "this notion of duality is motivated , in fact , by the _ clauses - variables _ duality that we observed in a previous investigation in the zero - temperature behaviour of a model of random satisfiability  @xcite , which has the structure of a disordered diluted interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    * in section 2 we introduce some mathematical formalism , in particular about the notion of duality and fourier transform for generic abelian groups . * in the sections from 3 to 8 we discuss our duality under general aspects : in section 3 we describe the most general setting for the duality ; in section 4 we specialize the model to a formulation which is manifestly suitable for statistical mechanics models , and in section 5 we rederive the duality in this frame ; in section 6 we show how to reconduct an extension of the original definition to the primitive formulation of the problem , which is reminiscent of a set of gauge fields coupled to the interaction terms ; in section 7 we describe a particular extra - feature appearing in the model when delta constraints appears ; finally in section 8 we introduce a sufficient criterium for self - duality . * in sections from 9 to 13",
    "we show the application of these general ideas to some concrete physical examples : first , in sections 9 and 10 , a sort of random gaussian model , and a variant with random constraints ; further , in sections 11 and 12 , a generalization of potts model extended to random structures of interactions , and a discussion on how to recover , inside our framework , the traditional results for regular lattices ; finally , in section 13 , we discuss a concrete example of the general setting of section 6 , which is reminiscent of a scalar field theory coupled to electro - magnetism , both in the case of regular lattices and of disordered systems .",
    "* in section 14 we outline some conclusions , and introduce the perspective for a further generalization of the procedure , using different mathematical structures instead of an abelian group structure and the fourier transform .",
    "in this section we introduce the _ fourier transform _ for locally compact abelian groups , by means of the theory of characters , following the textbook of kirillov and gvishiani @xcite .",
    "first , we introduce the concept of _ dual group_. let @xmath9 be a locally compact abelian group ( we always write our abelian groups additively ) .",
    "let @xmath10 be the set of irreducible representations of @xmath9 .",
    "it is well known that the irreducible representations of @xmath9 are all one - dimensional : thus , for each @xmath11 , the representation matrix @xmath12 , is one - dimensional and coincides with the character @xmath13 .",

    "the geometric duality applied to the lattice naturally exchanges sites with dual sites and bonds with plaquettes . in this case , the presence of the delta function for the terms of current divergence is redundant , as the constraint is automatically satisfied .",
    "variants in the spirit of disordered systems could involve a measure @xmath405 over an ensemble of random tessellations of the three - dimensional space , or , more generally , over an ensemble in which adjacency matrices are not directly derived from a geometrical structure , and the condition @xmath406 really needs to be enforced via a delta function in the gibbs weight .    in the case",
    "in which , following the recipe of section [ selfdual_sec ] , we have a self - dual measure @xmath407 , the fixed point of the involution for the electric charge @xmath408 is at the value @xmath409 .",
    "a general feature of our duality in the factorized case is that the resolution of constraints taking the form of delta functions has a dual counterpart in the removal of trivial constant factors , and vice versa .",
    "this feature can be seen in a transparent way in a simple unstructured problem , shown in section [ rcgm_sec ] , but it is more commonly used when the duality is combined with other geometric properties of the systems , as , for example , in the case of models defined over regular finite - dimensional cell - complexes .",

    "the model discussed in the previous section is a generalization of ordinary potts model . in this section",
    "we will show how our duality relation can be reconducted to the common duality of potts model on planar graphs  @xcite .    consider a connected graph @xmath221 , at this stage",

    "we remark that , at this point , this division is not necessary",

    "that is , for each bond @xmath338 , @xmath339 and @xmath340 will be respectively the first and second extremum of the bond .",
    "furthermore , each loop @xmath341 will be associated with a @xmath92-dimensional vector @xmath342 , such that , having arbitrarily chosen an orientation for the loop , @xmath342 is the number of times that the loop @xmath341 is occupied by the bond @xmath338 in the same orientation , minus the times it is occupied by @xmath338 in opposite orientation .    the potts model on the graph @xmath221",
    "is defined by the set of variables @xmath343 on the sites , and a set of interactions with coupling constants @xmath344 on the bonds . for the @xmath174 `` colours '' of the model ,",
    "although ordinary potts model hamiltonian has a @xmath345 total permutational symmetry between the colours .",
    "we stress again the important fact that in general the symmetry group of the model _ is not related _ to the group introduced to perform the fourier transform . ]",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath346 if we introduce the functions    [ effepg ] @xmath347    and the matroid @xmath348 , with @xmath0 a @xmath349 matrix defined as @xmath350 the partition function @xmath351 is in the general form ( [ standardz ] ) .",
    "now we remove the useless identity functions @xmath352 , and make the change of variables @xmath353 the weight of each configuration @xmath185 is now just @xmath354 .",
    "next , we want to perform the sum of the partition function on the new variables @xmath88 , instead that on the old @xmath185 .",
    "to this aim , we need to know how many configurations @xmath185 correspond to a certain configuration @xmath88 .",
    "the answer is simple : they are exactly @xmath174 if the circuitation of @xmath88 on each loop is zero ( that is , @xmath355 ) , not connected , we have a factor @xmath174 for each connected component . ] and zero if the circuitation is non - zero for some loop .",

    "we can perform the duality transformation .",
    "according to the general formula ( [ dual ] ) , and to the expressions for the fourier transforms of @xmath358 and @xmath359 , respectively @xmath360 the result of the transformation is a system in the original general form ( [ zpg1 ] ) .",
    "if the matrix @xmath361 is of the kind of @xmath362 , with exactly two non - zero entries per column , a @xmath363 and a @xmath364 , we can reconstruct a dual graphical version of the original potts model . as shown in detail in the [ app1 ]",
    ", this always happens when the original graph is planar . in a few words ,",
    "when a graph is planar , every bond appears in exactly two loops ( the plaquettes on the two sides ) .",
    "if we choose a uniform orientation for the loops ( all clockwise or all counter - clockwise ) , it appears in the two loops with opposite sign .",
    "so , in this dual model , two neighbouring plaquettes of the original graph appear to interact with the dual coupling constant of the common bond ( @xmath365 ) .",
    "if we want to reconstruct a graph such that the system has the variables on the sites , and the interactions on the bonds , the desired graph is exactly the dual graph of the original one , in the sense of cell - complexes duality .",
    "the procedure of this section can be applied with minor modifications to obtain the @xmath366-model    coulomb gas relation @xcite , provided that the @xmath366-model hamiltonian is in the villain form . essentially , the only difference is that the couple of dual groups is @xmath367 for the potts model , and @xmath368 for the @xmath366-model    coulomb gas relation .",
    "the notion of duality _",
    "a la _ kramers and wannier , after its original introduction in 1941 , has been applied to a wide range of periodic finite - dimensional systems of statistical mechanics . on the contrary , small",
    "work has been done in the direction of a systematic description of duality for a class of models sufficiently large to include , for example , mean - field disordered systems .",
    "our idea in this paper is that , in the kramers and wannier formulation , a sort of two - step procedure is implicit : an _ algebraic duality _ , which exchanges variables and interactions , and performs a fourier transform on the terms of the gibbs weight , and a _ geometric duality _ , which , exploiting the geometrical structure of the lattice , allows for a reinterpretation of the dual system in a formulation which , in some contexts , is suitable for a direct comparison with the original system .    in the more wide context of disordered systems",
    "the second step is in general impossible .",
    "nonetheless , in many cases the first step is already suitable for a fruitful comparison of the two systems related by duality .",
    "the general recipe is the following : given some _",
    "variables _ and some _ interactions _ ,",
    "valued on some abelian group @xmath9 , the gibbs weight depends from two ingredients :    * two sets of functions , weighting respectively the original variables , and the auxiliary variables corresponding to some linear combinations of the original ones ( the _ interactions _ ) ; * the specific pattern of linear combinations of the variables , encoded in a matrix @xmath0 of group - homomorphisms .",
    "the dual system exchanges variable - functions and interaction - functions with the fourier anti - transform and transform of interaction - functions and variable - functions , and the new pattern is given by the matrix @xmath290 of transposed homomorphisms .",
    "we give some concrete applications for specific simple models : a random gaussian model , a random potts - like model , a random variant of discrete scalar qed   for each of these systems , a short discussion over the duality relation is proposed , and a hint over self - duality conditions is suggested .",
    "actually , in the cases of interest , this discussion is a simple specialization of a general discussion done in section 8 , and analogous to the one already present in @xcite , where the duality , in its first application , was called _ variable - clause duality_.    an unexpected connection with matroid theory has emerged in the analysis of the subject . the _ a posteriori _ justification for",
    "this fact is that the pattern of interaction which is involved in the definition of the gibbs weight is intrinsic with respect to a choice of basis for the space of configurations .",
    "matroid theory , in simple words , describes mathematical objects which convey basis - intrinsic information on matrix - like objects , like the pattern of linear dependence between the columns of a matrix .",
    "hence , it is small surprise if the matroid related to the dual system is the matroid - dual of the matroid related to the original system .    in a forthcoming paper",
    "we would discuss a further generalization of this framework , in which the crucial concepts of _ fourier transform _ and of _ group - homomorphism _ for abelian groups are generalized to different integral transform and natural notions of homomorphism , applied to mathematical structures different from abelian groups .",
    "a first case is the one in which , for partially ordered sets , the natural notion of transform is the mbius transform , and the natural notion of homomorphisms is related to the theory of galois connections @xcite .",
    "an important subset of regular matroids is the set of graphical matroids .",
    "many results exist on the subject ( cfr .",
    ", for example , @xcite , chapt .  5 ) , derived in the spirit of generality characteristic of matroid theory . in this appendix",
    "we will show some constructive procedures which apply to particular classes of graphical matroids , so in this sense they are less general , but more clear restatements of known facts .",
    "hopefully , they will be useful to understand how to interpret the classical formulations of dualities for sm models on planar lattices inside our general setting of the duality .",
    "a precise terminology will be introduced in the body of the section . here",
    "we resume the main results :    the `` site - bond '' matroid @xmath362 and the `` loop - bond '' matroid @xmath410 of a graph @xmath411 are dual matroids .",
    "the `` site - bond '' matrix @xmath412 of a planar graph @xmath411 is equal to the `` loop - bond '' matrix @xmath413 of the corresponding geometrical dual graph @xmath414 , and conversely the `` loop - bond '' matrix of @xmath411 is equal to the `` site - bond '' matrix of @xmath414 .",
    "consider a graph @xmath411 , with vertices ( or sites ) @xmath415 and edges ( or bonds ) @xmath416 .",
    "we give an arbitrary orientation to the bonds .",
    "that is , for each bond @xmath338 , @xmath339 and @xmath340 will be respectively the first and second extremum of the bond .",
    "@xmath417^>{b}^(-0.5){s_{\\textrm{in}}(b ) } &   \\ar@{-}[r]^(1.5){s_{\\textrm{out}}(b ) } & \\bullet } \\ ] ] define a 0-form @xmath38 as a function from @xmath418 to a field @xmath112 , and a 1-form @xmath419 as a function from @xmath420 to @xmath112 .",
    "the operators @xmath421 and @xmath422 transform 0-forms in 1-forms and vice versa with the following definition : @xmath423 intuitively , they correspond to the discretization of the gradient operator on scalar fields and to the divergence operator on vector fields , generalized to arbitrary lattices .",
    "the sites are implicitly a particular case of 0-form , @xmath424 .",
    "the set of 0-forms is a vector space over @xmath112 , of dimension @xmath425 .",
    "it is naturally decomposed in two vector spaces , @xmath426 and @xmath427 , where 0-forms in @xmath427 are constant on each of the @xmath267 connected components of @xmath411 ( so @xmath428 ) , and 0-forms in @xmath426 are obtained by quotient ( so @xmath429 ) .",
    "projection on @xmath426 is obtained via the operator @xmath430 .",
    "analogously , the set of 1-forms is a vector space @xmath431 over @xmath112 , of dimension @xmath432 .",
    "the bonds are a particular case of generic 1-forms , where it is understood @xmath433 , and are a basis for the space @xmath431 .",
    "we will define the loops as the 1-forms @xmath419 such that @xmath434 .",
    "elementary plaquettes are particular cases of loops : if @xmath435 is the border of an oriented plaquette @xmath108 , @xmath436 is the characteristic function on @xmath435 .",
    "the set of loops is a vector space @xmath337 over @xmath112 , of dimension @xmath336 .",
    "note that @xmath437 as a consequence of euler formula .",
    "more deeply , the vector space @xmath431 is decomposed into @xmath438 , that is , a generic 1-form @xmath419 is uniquely decomposed into @xmath439 , with @xmath440 and @xmath441 ( hodge decomposition ) .",
    "the patterns of linear dependence of the set of bonds projected onto the vector spaces @xmath442 and @xmath337 are matroids .",
    "they will be called respectively the _ site - bond _ and the _ loop - bond _ matroids . given a choice of basis for @xmath426 and @xmath337",
    ", we will denote the corresponding vectorial representations as @xmath362 and @xmath410 .",
    "that is , for a set of 0-forms @xmath443 chosen as a basis for @xmath426 , the entries of @xmath362 will be @xmath444 and for a set of 1-forms @xmath445 chosen as a basis for @xmath337 , the entries of @xmath410 will be @xmath446 we will give a particularly skill choice of basis , for which the two matroids are both in standard vectorial form , and manifestly dual .",
    "choose a `` ground '' site @xmath447 , and a spanning tree @xmath448 .",
    "change the orientation of the bonds such that for each site @xmath449 there is exactly one out - going bond in @xmath450 .",
    "label this bond @xmath451 .",
    "say that @xmath452 iff an oriented path @xmath453 in @xmath454 exists . choose a basis for @xmath426 as @xmath455 so we have @xmath456 we will choose a basis for @xmath337 such that for each bond @xmath457 there is exactly one 1-form @xmath458 such that @xmath459 is non - zero .",
    "so we can label the edges in @xmath460 as @xmath461 .",
    "more precisely , the 1-form @xmath458 corresponds to the only self - avoiding closed path on @xmath462 , oriented according to @xmath461 .",
    "analytically this can be expressed as @xmath463 it is immediate to check that @xmath362 and @xmath410 are in standard vectorial form , respectively with the identity block on the left and on the right . from the observation that @xmath464 we obtain that they are dual in matroid sense : @xmath465 as we have found an explicit choice of basis for which the standard form of the site - bond matroid and of the loop - bond matroid are dual , we have implicitly proved that the matroids are dual , which is the claim of theorem  1 .      in the previous section",
    "we have seen how the `` abstract '' site - bond and the loop - bond matroids for a given graph are dual in the sense of matroid duality .",
    "this is true in general , as the matroid definition is intrinsic , and specifically we have verified it in a particular choice of basis , for which both the matroids are in standard form . in this section",
    "we show the result of theorem  2 , that the site - bond and the loop - bond incidence matrices for a connected planar graph and for its graphical dual are exchanged by the graphical duality .",
    "this result relies on a particular choice for the loops as the elementary plaquettes of the lattice , which is the more natural for the case of planar graphs , but in this sense is more accidental .",
    "a graph @xmath411 is said to be _ planar _ when it is embeddable on a genus-@xmath3 surface with no crossings between the bonds .",
    "consider the case in which @xmath411 is connected .",
    "the classical euler relation for this kind of graphs claims that @xmath466 , where @xmath418 is the number of sites , @xmath92 is the number of bonds and @xmath467 is the number of faces .",
    "one can immediately define the site - bond and loop - bond incidence matrices , @xmath468 and @xmath469 , for non - oriented bonds and loops . just state",
    "that @xmath468 is 1 if the site @xmath470 is an extremum of the bond @xmath338 and 0 elsewhere , and @xmath469 is 1 if the bond @xmath338 is a side of the face @xmath341 and 0 elsewhere .    the graphical dual @xmath414 is defined by the following procedure .",
    "replace each plaquette @xmath341 by a dual vertex @xmath471 ( white bullets in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , each bond @xmath338 by a dual ( dashed ) bond @xmath472 , which crosses it and connects the dual vertices of the two neighbouring plaquettes , and each site @xmath470 with the dual plaquette @xmath473 delimited by the dual bonds of the bonds outgoing from the site .",
    "it is clear that @xmath474    [ fig_plangraph ]    ) to hold ( right ) . ]",
    "if we put an orientation on the bonds and a direction of rotation on the faces , the matrices @xmath468 and @xmath469 will be promoted to some matrices @xmath475 and @xmath476 , in which some minus signs appear . again because of the planarity of the graph , we could give a recipe such that the relation ( [ asbl ] ) above is promoted to a relation @xmath477 the recipe is the following : choose the direction of rotation to be the same for all the faces , ( for example clockwise ) , and opposite between faces and dual faces .",
    "choose the orientation of the bonds arbitrarily .",
    "the orientation of the dual bonds must be such that the vector product between each bond and its dual bond has the same sign with respect to the normal versor outgoing from the surface .",
    "both the matrices @xmath475 and @xmath476 are not of maximal rank , and the only linear relation is given by the sum of all the rows with equal coefficients .",
    "this accounts for the offset of 2 in the euler formula @xmath466 , in fact the number of `` independent sites '' in the loop - bond matroid ( 0-forms up to an arbitrary constant ) is @xmath478 , and the number of independent loops is @xmath479 , from which we recover the relation @xmath437 .",
