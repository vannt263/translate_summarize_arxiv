    "an effective field theory ( @xmath0 ) has been constructed that allows for precise calculations of very low - energy nuclear processes . in this energy regime , all multi - nucleon interactions are described by local operators .",
    "the relative size of the contribution of an operator to a particular observable can be estimated by the power - counting rules developed in  @xcite .",
    "an array of phenomena have been studied with @xmath0 , such as the radiative capture @xmath1 relevant to big - bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite , elastic and inelastic @xmath2 scattering  @xcite relevant to the ongoing efforts to measure the solar - neutrino flux and the cross section for @xmath3  @xcite , the electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron  @xcite , and other processes involving electroweak gauge fields ( for a detailed review of this subject see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    while calculation of such processes to high precision is straightforward , the number of feynman diagrams involved can become quite large .",
    "it was shown that determining the coefficients in the lagrange density by reproducing the deuteron binding energy , @xmath4 , and the residue of the deuteron pole , @xmath5 , at next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite , instead of reproducing the scattering length , @xmath6 and effective range , @xmath7 at nlo dramatically improves the convergence of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the effective range in both s - wave channels is somewhat larger than one would naively guess , the expansion parameter in the @xmath8 channel being @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the deuteron binding momentum .",
    "one of the simplifications we suggest in this work is that @xmath7 should be taken to be of order @xmath11 in the power counting , a suggestion first made in ref .",
    "this naturally leads to the use of fields , as first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and profitably exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this formulation of @xmath0",
    ", operators are ordered according to powers of the total center - of - mass energy .",
    "we will see that this simplification is a consequence of a redundancy in the operator structure of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , in this modified power counting , operators representing higher - dimensional nucleon contact interactions are not renormalized by the s - wave interactions as in standard @xmath0  @xcite and as a consequence are ordered according to naive dimensional analysis .",
    "these observations lead to a remarkable simplification in the computation of higher order effects .",
    "to begin with , we make the following general observation that simplifies computations in @xmath0 . in higher order calculations , galilean - invariant operators appear involving a large number of derivatives acting on the incoming and outgoing nucleon fields . by integrating by parts and then using the equations of motion for the nucleon field the number of higher order operators is greatly reduced , and calculations are simplified further by utilizing operators involving time - derivatives and not just spatial derivatives . to show this we consider the interaction lagrange density that contributes to nn scattering in the @xmath8-channel at next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath12lo ) in the eft expansion , @xmath13 \\ \\ \\ , \\label{eq : cfour}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the spin - isospin projector for the @xmath8 channel is @xmath14\\   = \\ { 1\\over 2 } \\delta^{ij } \\ \\ \\ .",

    "the operator @xmath17 when acting on the two - nucleon operator simply yields the non - relativistic center - of - mass energy .",

    "( [ eq : cfour ] ) becomes @xmath18^\\dagger { \\cal o}_e n^t p^j n \\ \\ \\ , \\label{eq : cfoure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and involves only one operator .",
    "it is clear how to generalize this result to higher orders in the @xmath0 expansion , and in fact , there is only one new operator for each higher order in the energy expansion .",
    "this is completely consistent with the effective range ( er ) expansion  @xcite , and with the previous works on @xmath0  @xcite where it was shown that nn scattering constrains only the combination @xmath19 .",
    "an all - orders argument for nn scattering has been given previously  @xcite .",
    "the one place where these operator relations require a little thought is where electroweak currents are inserted .",
    "actually , the above argument holds when derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives .",
    "previous @xmath0 calculations have shown that the @xmath20 and @xmath21 operators contribute differently to electroweak observables . however , it is always a linear combination of these operators and a gauge invariant higher dimension operator that appears , and it is this combination that is fit to data . thus using the operator structure of eq .",
