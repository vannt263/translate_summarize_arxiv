    "in recent years , spintronics has emerged as one of the most studied fields of research in the semiconductor physics because of the possibility of exploiting both the carrier spin and charge degrees of freedom for the storage and transport of information in semiconductor devices@xcite . because of the already existing fabrication technology for iii - v semiconductors , the doping of these systems with magnetic ions ( especially the cases of ga(mn)as and ga(mn)n ) is being intensively investigated@xcite and",
    "a large amount of theoretical and experimental work has been done in order to understand the underlying mechanism for the ferromagnetism in these doped semiconductors.@xcite    recently , an alternative approach for this phenomenon has been considered@xcite by taking a non - magnetic spinel semiconductor as host material and by doping it with fe .",
    "the spinel structure ( stochiometric formula ab@xmath0o@xmath1 ) with two types of cation sites ( tetrahedral a and octahedral b ) offers new possibilities of obtaining ferromagnetic order by doping one or both type of cation sites with magnetic ions .",
    "first experiments@xcite on the solid solution [ znga@xmath0o@xmath2@xmath3[fe@xmath4o@xmath1]@xmath6 with x=0.05,0.10 and 0.15 showed that long - range magnetic order is induced with curie temperatures up to 200k .",
    "similar attempts by krimmel _",
    "et al._@xcite on fe@xmath7in@xmath8s@xmath1 revealed , on the contrary , a spin glass state at low temperatures    along these lines , we investigate the electronic structure of fe doped znga@xmath0o@xmath9within density functional theory ( dft ) with special emphasis on the magnetic and transport properties .",
    "since the description of these properties may be affected by the choice of the exchange correlation ( xc ) potential considered within dft , we perform a comparative study of the properties by considering two different xc approaches : the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",
    "we observe that though the electronic structure of the parent compound znga@xmath0o@xmath9remains almost unaffected by the change of the xc potential chosen , the kind of fe substitution ( e.g. whether in a - site or in b - site ) shows quite different magnetic and transport properties depending on the chosen xc functional .",
    "we will show that the various doping options allow for a variety of interesting behaviors which range from spin - polarized metal to the so - called transport half - metal. though both properties are of potential interest for spintronic purposes , we will discuss that alternative choices of substituent or host compound may improve the quality of these properties .",
    "we have organized the paper in the following way . in section",
    "ii we present a study of the volume optimization of the parent compound within lda and gga , which sets the reference frame for the doped cases . in the subsequent three sections ( iii , iv and v ) we analyse the electronic structure properties of fe - doped znga@xmath0o@xmath9within both xc potentials in three different limits , namely , fe doped in the zn position , fe doped in the ga position and fe doped into both zn and ga positions respectively . finally in section vi we present the summary of our calculations with a comparison to the available experimental data and conclude with suggestions for some possible future experiments .",
    "we have performed dft calculations using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave code wien2k @xcite . in our calculations , we chose apw+lo as the basis set .",
    "the atomic sphere radii were chosen to be 1.8 a.u . for zn ,",
    "ga and fe and 1.6 a.u . for o. expansion in spherical harmonics for the radial wave functions",
    "were taken up to @xmath10 and the charge densities and potentials were represented by spherical harmonics up to @xmath11 . for brillouin - zone ( bz ) integrations we considered a 60 @xmath12 points mesh in the irreducible wedge and the modified tetrahedron method was applied.@xcite      znga@xmath0o@xmath1 crystallizes in a normal spinel structure ( space group @xmath13 ( 227 ) ) with the primitive ( rhombohedral ) unit cell containing two formula units with zn , ga and o at the positions ( 1/8,1/8,1/8 ) , ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) and ( u , u , u ) respectively ( where u=1/4 corresponds to a perfect spinel structure ) .",
    "zn is sorrounded by a tetrahedral environment of oxygens while ga sits on an octahedral position .",
    "in order to adopt a reliable approximation for the xc potential in the description of the parent compound , we performed a full volume optimization within two widely used parametrizations of the xc functional : namely , the lda@xcite and the gga@xcite approach .",
    "for each selected volume we also considered the relaxation of the internal coordinate of oxygen ( u parameter ) as allowed by the symmetry in the space group 227 , by using the damped newton dynamics method , until a force value smaller than 1 mryd / a.u .",
    "was reached .",
    "the energy minimum of the various selected volumes defines then the optimal volume .",
    "[ volopt ] shows the total electronic energy as a function of the volume of the rhombohedral unit cell for lda and gga ( v=@xmath14 a@xmath15 where a is the conventional cubic cell parameter ) .",
    "the optimized lattice constant whose experimental value@xcite is a=8.334  , is found to be underestimated in lda by about 1@xmath16 and it is overestimated in gga by about 1.5@xmath16 . in table",
    "[ dist ] we show a comparison of tetrahedral ( zn - o ) and octahedral ( ga - o ) distances between the optimized ones and the experimental ones .",
    "note that the experimental values are underestimated by lda and overestimated by gga .",
    "this kind of behaviour is generally not unexpected when adopting the lda or the gga approximations in the description of semiconductors .",
    "for instance , in a recent _ ab - initio _ @xcite study of the spinel znal@xmath0o@xmath1 , the lda lattice constant underestimation was found to be of 1.1@xmath16 .",
    "the origin of the lda and gga shortcoming may be ascribed to the inability of both approximations to describe properly the binding due to long - range forces like the van der waals interaction ( apart from the inaccuracy concerning exchange and correlation ) .",
    "in contrast , optimization of the u parameter for znga@xmath0o@xmath9converges to 0.3861 within lda and 0.3866 within gga , both in good agreement with the experimental value of 0.3867 .",
    "we have also estimated the residual and less important discrepancies due to the neglect of the zero point and thermal motion of the atoms .",
    "assuming the cubic spinel to be an isotropic three dimensional harmonic oscillator with a spring strength given by the curvature of the energy vs lattice constant function , we estimate the ground state length fluctuation to be 0.019  within lda .",
    "this represents a deviation of about 0.2@xmath16 with respect to the classical adiabatic value .",
    "the thermal expansion from zero to room temperature is expected to produce an effect on the lattice parameter less than 0.1@xmath16 , as inferrable from the data of josties _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , therefore these corrections fall within the inaccuracy of the xc approximations used here .    from the fit of the energy - volume curves of fig .",
    "[ volopt ] to the murnaghan equation of state @xcite we extract a bulk modulus for znga@xmath0o@xmath9of 217 gpa within lda and 146 gpa within gga .",
    "structure optimizations for the spinels znal@xmath0o@xmath1 and znga@xmath0o@xmath1 have been performed in the past within the framework of the shell model @xcite providing a bulk modulus of 273 and 237 gpa respectively .",
    "recently levy _",
    "et al._@xcite have measured the bulk modulus of znal@xmath0o@xmath1 to be 202 gpa well below the value obtained by the shell model ( 273 gpa ) .",
    "therefore , assuming that the shell model bulk modulus is affected by the same amount of discrepancy for both znal@xmath0o@xmath1 and znga@xmath0o@xmath1 and since our calculated values for znga@xmath0o@xmath9are lower than that of the shell model , we expect our results to be in a better agreement to experiment than the shell model result .",
    "we conclude from the previous comparison that the gradient correction to lda as implemented in gga does nt produce a significant improvement upon the lda itself as far as the host compound is concerned .",
    "however , in the following sections we will see that upon fe substitution the lda and gga outcomes may turn out to be quite different .    .optimized and experimental tetrahedral and octahedral distances . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ force ]",
    "in conclusion , we have performed a systematic _ ab - initio _ study of fe doped znga@xmath0o@xmath9to investigate the effect of fe substitution on the electronic structure of the parent spinel compound znga@xmath0o@xmath9 . for an accurate account of the magnetic and transport properties we considered various exchange correlation functionals and we observed that the electronic properties of the doped system depend significantly on the exchange - correlation functional used , especially when fe is doped on the b cation site or on both a and b cation sites of the spinel compound . whereas in the case of fe doped in the a site both lda and gga give qualitatively the same results ( close to an ionic picture ) , b - site doping leads to different ground state spin of fe within lda and gga . during the course of this study we also tried to explore the possibilities of obtaining a strongly polarized half - metallic groundstate which is a desirable property for spintronic applications .",
    "we observed that fe doping in a - site could give rise to a spin polarized current due to the presence of highly dispersive @xmath17 band in one spin channel . in b - site , mn instead of fe could lead to a half - metallic state by setting the fermi level in a comparatively wider @xmath18 band in the spin up channel .",
    "doping both a and b sites with fe leads to a so called transport half metal when there is a direct fe - fe bonding in the b - sites .",
    "finally , recent work on [ znga@xmath0o@xmath1]@xmath3[fe@xmath4o@xmath1]@xmath6 for various large fe doping concentrations , showed the existence of a ferromagnetic phase up to 200k .",
    "mssbauer spectra were measured and provided a quadrupolar splitting of 0.52 mm / s .",
    "assuming a nuclear quadrupole moment for @xmath19fe of 0.16 barn , as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite within the lapw method , the resulting electric field gradient ( efg ) is 3.12 v/@xmath20 . alternatively , assuming a nuclear quadrupole moment of 0.2 barn , as calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the efg is 2.5 v/@xmath20 . when fe is substituted into an a site no efg develops due to the spherical local symmetry at the nucleus . instead , in the case of fe doped into b site",
    "the optimized structure provided us with an efg at the fe site of 2.11 v/@xmath20 , which compares fairly well with the experimental values . in the doping case of fe into a and b sites",
    "we did nt perform a structure optimization , and , since efg is quite sensitive to structural changes , we obtain quite different values with respect to the experimental ones .    the mssbauer experiment of risbud _ et al .",
    "_ detected the presence of only fe@xmath21 .",
    "this result would discard the option of fe doped in the a site in favor of fe doped on the b site since from our calculations fe in the a site takes up an oxidation state close to 2 + and not to 3 + .",
    "in fact , in znga@xmath0o@xmath1 the site preference of zn@xmath22 towards the tetrahedral sites is much stronger than the fe one @xcite and this can explain why risbud _",
    "_ detected the presence of only fe@xmath21 , which probably occupies predominantly b sites .",
    "alternatively , mg@xmath22 has a weaker preference for the a site than ga and fe , therefore replacing zn@xmath22 with mg@xmath22 can provide a practically easier way to populate a sites with fe , and mgga@xmath0o@xmath1 would be a better host candidate for the properties presented here concerning fe doping on the a site .",
