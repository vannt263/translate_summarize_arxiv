    "since @xcite it has been clear that the concept of space in the presence of nearby d ",
    "branes is radically modified .",
    "one way to express it is to say that the positions of the branes are replaced by suitable matrices , whose entries actually represent open strings stretched among them .",
    "this entails in particular that at short brane distances space becomes .",
    "this picture is indeed very suggestive , but not very effective in representing space non  commutativity .",
    "it has been only recently , @xcite , that noncommutativity has surfaced in a very effective and manageable way .",
    "this happens precisely when d  branes are in presence of a constant nsns b - field . in this case , the low energy effective action of the open strings attached to the branes can be represented by a euclidean field theory defined on a spacetime .",
    "all this clearly holds at a semiclassical level ( i.e. tree amplitudes computed in the string and the field theory setting compare well )",
    ". however one can try to compare loop amplitudes calculated both in string theory and in the corresponding field theory , in order to see how effective the effective field theory is .",
    "several calculations of this type have been carried out , see @xcite and in particular @xcite , and some discrepancies have recently surfaced , @xcite .",
    "the latter papers seem to imply that more general * products are necessary , in order for the effective field theory to faithfully represent string loop contributions .",
    "it seems to be important therefore to know exactly what are the properties of a ym theory we can rely on .",
    "one of the basic properties is renormalizability . in this paper",
    "we consider a ym theory with @xmath0 gauge group in 4d without matter , and study its one  loop renormalizability properties . since we take for granted that non ",
    "planar singularities are dumped by the noncommutative parameter @xmath1 @xcite , we only consider the planar one  loop contributions .",
    "this has already been partially done as far as the @xmath2 gauge theory is concerned @xcite , and for two and three  point functions for @xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "we want to complete such calculations by computing the one  loop four  point function in a pure @xmath0 yang  mills theory in 4d , for which some doubts have been raised .",
    "it is obvious that if gauge ( brst ) invariance is assumed , the calculation we do is superfluous .",
    "but in a gauge theory some caution has to be used and brst invariance has to be proved rather then assumed .",
    "we have in fact a simple counterexample : ncso(2 ) gauge theory , which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "if we define the feynman rules in the most obvious way , it is immediate to see that for 2- and 3-gluon vertices the one  loop corrections identically vanish , while the 4-gluon has a divergent part at one - loop . therefore this theory is not one  loop renormalizable ( at least in the ordinary sense ) .",
    "our final result is however reassuring .",
    "_ noncommutative @xmath0 gauge theories are one  loop renormalizable_.",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we set notations and conventions . in section 3",
    "we compute the relevant one  loop amplitudes for a @xmath0 theory .",
    "we also make a comment on the possibility of defining consistent @xmath3 feynman rules .",
    "our theory is specified by the action s = d^4x ( - f_f^- ( _ a^)^2 + ( i|c*_d^c - i_d^c*|c ) ) [ action ] where f_= _ a_- _ a_-ig(a _ a _",
    "-a_a_)[fmunu ] and the moyal product is defined with respect to the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the potential @xmath6 is valued in the lie algebra @xmath4 , i.e. is an hermitian matrix , and we will choose the feynman gauge @xmath7 . as is customary in dealing with 4d field theories , throughout the paper",
    "we use a minkowski formulation of the theory , although its brane origin is euclidean .",
    "since the properties of the lie algebra @xmath4 tensors are crucial in our calculation , we devote the rest of this section to deriving them .",
    "we use a basis @xmath8 , @xmath9 of traceless hermitean matrices for the lie algebra @xmath10 , with normalization ( t^a t^b ) = 12^ab and structure constants @xmath11 defined by = i f_abct^c  .",
    "we define also the third order ad - invariant completely symmetric tensor @xmath12 by means of \\{t^a , t^b}= 1n _ ab+ d_abc t^c  .",
    "next we pass to the lie algebra @xmath4 by introducing the additional generator @xmath13 . corresponding to any index @xmath14 for @xmath10 we introduce the index @xmath15 , so that @xmath16 runs from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "we have = i",

    "we have also ( t^a t^b)= 12 ^ab  .",

    "the external gluons carry labels @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 for lie algebra , lorentz index and momentum , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "there are four distinct graphs contributing to the 4gluon vertex : the gluon box @xmath54 , the ghost box @xmath55 , the gluon triangle @xmath56 and the gluon candy @xmath57 .",
    "there are two main type of contributions , distinguished by their lie algebra tensor structure .",

    "the contributions ( [ second ] ) give rise to i g^4 & [ secondf ] where t_= g_g _",
    "+ g_g_- 2g_g_[t ]    comparing ( [ secondf ] ) with eq.([4gluv ] ) in the appendix , we see that the contribution ( [ secondf ] ) implies that the four  a term in the action is renormalized with a @xmath60 given by z_4 = 1 - g^2 n  .[z4 ] this is the same renormalization that occurs in ordinary @xmath0 yang ",
    "mills theories .",
    "therefore , _ the @xmath0 yang ",
    "mills theories are one  loop renormalizable_.    the @xmath2 case must be treated separately . using the corresponding feynman rules ( see appendix ) ,",
    "one finds the 2 and 3point contributions evaluated above with @xmath61 and @xmath62 and multiplied by @xmath63 . as for the 4point function , the term corresponding to ( [ secondf ] ) is obtained by setting @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the latter .",
    "therefore all the renormalization constants satisfy the renormalization conditions , and , as a consequence , the @xmath2 gauge theory is one  loop renormalizable too , @xcite .",
    "we would like finally to present some results ( which are obtained without much effort as byproducts of the previous calculations ) concerning a restriction from the @xmath0 to the @xmath3 case .",
    "it is not known what a @xmath3 gauge theory is , although an attempt of defining it has been done recently , @xcite .",
    "in particular we do not know the explicit form of the action .",
    "therefore we can only try to guess the relevant feynman rules .",
    "the most obvious possibility one can envisage is that they are simply obtained from the feynman rules of the @xmath0 theory by restricting everywhere the @xmath0 indices @xmath66 to the corresponding @xmath3 ones @xmath67 .",
    "as one can see in this case the renormalization constants do not coincide with the ones in the ordinary @xmath3 gauge theory . strictly speaking",
    "this is not enough to conclude that the @xmath3 theory is nonrenormalizable , unless one assumes that the @xmath68 limit of the quantum theory is smooth .",
    "however , even allowing for such more general possibility , it is easy to show that the theory defined by such feynman rules is not one  loop renormalizable , see also @xcite . to this purpose",
    "it is sufficient to compare the ratio of the renormalization constants of gluon propagator , @xmath69 , and the three gluon vertex , @xmath46 , with the ratio of ghost propagator , @xmath70 , and ghost - ghost - gluon vertex , @xmath71 .",
    "if the @xmath3 theory were renormalizable , we should find @xmath72 .",
    "instead we obtain @xmath73 where we used the traces over the @xmath3 indices that can be found in @xcite .",
