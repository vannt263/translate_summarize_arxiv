    "perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) calculations are essential to describe processes with large momentum transfer . the double charmonium production processes , @xmath10 with @xmath1 , play an important role for understanding the production and hadronization properties of the heavy quarkonium .",
    "in addition to being a demonstration of the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization @xcite , such kind of charmonium production also provides a good opportunity to learn pqcd color - singlet mechanism  @xcite .    in the literature",
    ", these processes have been studied within the pqcd factorization up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , cf .",
    "their polarized cross sections up to nlo can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 stand for the helicities of the outgoing @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the tree - level coefficients @xmath16 where the charm quark electric charge @xmath17 and the color factor @xmath18= @xmath19 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the radial wavefunction at the origin and the first derivative of the radial wavefunction at the origin for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the lo coefficients @xmath23 and the nlo coefficients @xmath24 are put in the appendix .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 stands for the renormalization scale .    for calculating all the polarized and the unpolarized cross sections of the processes @xmath10",
    ", one needs to introduce the renormalization scale @xmath25 . in the literature",
    ", it is usually taken as the typical momentum flow of the process ( @xmath26 ) , e.g. @xmath27 or @xmath28 or @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "however which one can result in the right theoretical estimation is not clear . as for conventional scale",
    "setting , the renormalization scale is fixed once it has been set to be @xmath26 ; for convenience , we call it the initial renormalization scale @xmath30 . that is , under conventional scale setting , one always sets @xmath31 .",
    "it has been observed that under such scale setting , one usually obtains sizable renormalization scale dependent estimation @xcite , which could be up to @xmath32 for taking @xmath25 to be the above mentioned three typical scales , and up to @xmath33 by varying @xmath25 within the region of @xmath34 $ ] for a specific @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the renormalization scale uncertainty usually provides a large systematic error under the conventional scale setting .",
    "especially , the arbitrary choice of @xmath34 $ ] could be misleading in certain cases .",
    "for example , ref.@xcite argues that after including the first and second order corrections to the deep inelastic sum rules which are due to heavy flavor contributions , the renormalization scale @xmath35 should be taken as @xmath36 , if taking the typical scale @xmath26 to be the corresponding heavy quark mass @xmath37 .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that the principle of maximum conformality ( pmc ) provides a possible solution for eliminating such renormalization scale ambiguity  @xcite .",
    "pmc provides the underlying principle for the blm mechanism  @xcite , a recent review on pmc can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the main idea of pmc lies in that one can first finish the renormalization procedure for any pqcd process by using an initial value for the renormalization scale ( @xmath30 ) , and then set the effective or optimal pmc scale for the process .",
    "the pmc scale is generally different from @xmath30 , which is formed by absorbing all non - conformal terms that rightly governs the running behavior of the coupling via the renormalization group equation into the coupling constant  @xcite . in different to conventional scale setting",
    ", one can choose any arbitrary value to be @xmath38 , but the optimal pmc scale and the resulting finite - order pmc prediction are both to high accuracy independent of such arbitrariness , consistent with the renormalization group invariance .",
    "the pmc satisfies all self - consistency conditions for setting the renormalization scale  @xcite .",
    "after proper procedures , all non - conformal @xmath39-terms in the perturbative expansion are summed into the running coupling so that the remaining terms in the perturbative series are identical to that of a conformal theory .",
    "the qcd predictions from pmc are then independent of renormalization scheme , inversely , such scheme independence can be adopted to derive commensurate scale relations among different observables  @xcite . moreover , after pmc scale setting , the divergent ",
    "renormalon \" series @xmath40 does not appear in the conformal series and the convergence of the pqcd series can be greatly improved in principle . for example , such merits have been shown by a next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) pmc analysis of the top - quark pair production at the hadronic colliders  @xcite .",
    "as the main purpose of the present paper , we shall show that even at the nlo level , the pqcd prediction after pmc scale setting can also have such good features , thus our understanding of @xmath41 can be greatly improved .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec.ii , we give the polarized and unpolarized cross sections for the double charmonium production under pmc scale setting . numerical results and discussions are presented in sec.iii .",
    "the final section is reserved for a summary .",
    "to set the pmc scales for high - energy processes , one needs to decompose the perturbative coefficients at each @xmath42 order into @xmath39-dependent and independent parts respectively . for the double charmonium production at the nlo level , we need to decompose the nlo coefficient @xmath43 into @xmath44-dependent part ( non - conformal part ) and @xmath44-independent part ( conformal part ) , i.e. @xmath45 where the non - conformal @xmath46 and the conformal @xmath47 can be found in the appendix . then , following the standard procedure of pmc , the polarized cross section ( [ pol : cross : section ] ) can be rewritten as ,    @xmath48    with the pmc scale @xmath49 it shows that the pmc scales are determined by the non - conformal terms which govern the dominant behavior of the running coupling constant . at present , because the non - conformal terms @xmath46 are different for @xmath50 , the pmc scales , and hence the theoretical estimations , for these cross sections are also different .",
    "this is one of the important features of pmc scale setting .",
    "similarly , the nlo coefficients @xmath51 of the unpolarized / total cross sections can also be decomposed into the non - conformal part @xmath52 and the conformal part @xmath53 . after pmc scale setting , the total cross section @xmath54 reduces to @xmath55 with the pmc scale , @xmath56 it is noted that the initial scale dependent logarithmic terms in @xmath57 and @xmath58 should be absorbed into the coupling constant simultaneously with the non - conformal terms via the renormalization group equation of the coupling constant , so after applying pmc scale setting , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are still at the initial scale @xmath38 .",
    "as for the functions of the total cross sections ( [ pmctotal ] ) , we have    @xmath61    for @xmath4 ; @xmath62 for @xmath63 ; @xmath64 for @xmath65 , respectively . here , for convenience , we have omitted the initial scale @xmath66 dependence to the coefficients @xmath60 and the pmc scale @xmath67 dependence in the lo cross sections .",
    "the summed up non - conformal functions @xmath52 are usually different from their polarized terms @xmath46 , then the pmc scales for the total cross sections are generally different from the pmc scales for the polarized cross sections .",
    "furthermore , because the non - conformal terms @xmath52 are different for @xmath50 , the pmc scales of these total cross sections are also different .",
    "thus , for the considered processes , we have to introduce several pmc scales for the polarized and the unpolarized cross sections .",
    "the physical picture for the introducing of different pmc scales is clear , all pmc scales are determined by those known @xmath39-terms that rightly determine the running behavior of the strong coupling constant in each case .",
    "it is noted that these pmc scales only formally depend on the choice of the initial renormalization scale , but as will be shown later , all these pmc scales are almost independent of the initial choice of renormalization scale , and then the renormalization scale dependence can be greatly suppressed ( or even eliminated in comparison to the errors caused by other uncertainty sources as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and etc . ) . as a consistent cross - check of pmc estimation , it is helpful to show whether after pmc scale setting , by summing up all the polarized cross section , one can still get the same result as that of the directly calculated unpolarized cross section .",
    "this , inversely , can also be used as a criteria of whether the complex higher - order calculations are right or not .    at the nlo level",
    ", it is noted that the coefficients proportional to @xmath68 or @xmath44 are the same , so one can practically obtain @xmath69 .",
    "but there are advantages for using pmc other than blm :    * the pmc provides the underling principle for blm , which clearly shows how the @xmath68-terms are eliminated .",
    "the pmc can be extended to any perturbative order in a self - consistent way .",
    "* that is , to set the optimized scale , it is not simply to set the coefficient before @xmath68 to zero but to eliminate @xmath68 in a combined form as @xmath44 or other @xmath39-functions that rightly governs the running behavior of the coupling constant .",
    "otherwise , one may not get the correct conformal term for estimating the physical observable , especially in some specific cases when the conformal and non - conformal terms have no connection  @xcite .",
    "* by using pmc scale setting , one can conveniently show how the pqcd convergence can be improved in principle and how the renormalization scale dependence can be greatly suppressed or eliminated even at the nlo level .",
    "to do numerical calculation , we set the collision energy @xmath70 gev , the charm quark mass @xmath71 gev @xcite , i.e. half of the @xmath72-mass for charm quark , which is consistent with the bound - state parameters under the potential - model calculations  @xcite . ] and @xmath73 @xcite . using the two - loop @xmath42 running with @xmath74  @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath75 gev , @xmath76 gev , and @xmath77 gev .",
    "based on the experimental values for the leptonic width of @xmath14 and @xmath78 and the width of @xmath79 to two photons , we can inversely determine the radial wavefunction @xmath80 at the origin and the first derivative of the radial wavefunction at the origin @xmath81 through the nlo formulas  @xcite @xmath82 and @xmath83 to be consistent with the present nlo analysis of quarkonium pair production , we need a nlo determination of @xmath80 and @xmath81 . to set the pmc scales for those decay widths , one needs to finish the nnlo calculation for these processes , which however are not available at present due to its complexity . for simplicity",
    ", we set its scale as the one usually suggested in the literature , i.e. @xmath84 , and only provide a rough estimation on different scale choices . for experimental values of these decay widths ,",
    "we adopt those from the particle data group  @xcite : @xmath85 kev , @xmath86 kev and @xmath87 kev .",
    "then , as a combined error being the squared average of the experimental errors on the decay widths and the theoretical errors caused by varying the scale within the conventional region of @xmath88 $ ] , we obtain : @xmath89-wave and @xmath90-wave states , and treat all @xmath91-wave states have the same @xmath92 . at present , in order to provide a relatively reliable estimation of the scale error , following the idea of pmc , we first transform eqs.([wave1],[wave2 ] ) into general renormalization scale dependent forms by including the dominant log - terms , which have been eliminated by directly setting the renormalization scale to be the typical momentum transfer @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "that is , before analyzing the scale error , eqs.([wave1],[wave2 ] ) are rewritten by using conventional running behavior of the coupling constant as @xmath94 , \\\\ & & \\gamma_{\\chi(np)\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma } = { 64\\alpha^{2}\\over 45m^{4}_{c}}|r^{'}_{np}(0)|^{2}\\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad \\left[1-{16\\alpha_{s}(\\mu_r ) \\over 3\\pi}\\left(1+\\beta_{0}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mu_r^2}{\\mu_{r,0}^2 } \\right ) \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu_r)}{4\\pi}\\right)\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "some subtle points need to be mentioned : i ) this scale error analysis follows the idea of pmc but is an approximation because of lacking strict nnlo @xmath39-terms to determine its pmc scales ; ii ) only part of the two - loop correction that partly determines the running behavior of coupling constant has been considered , since it only involves the log - term @xmath97 dependent @xmath98-functions .",
    "even though such log term is at the one - order higher , it is necessary and can largely compensate the scale changes at the nlo level , otherwise , one will obtain abnormally large scale errors .",
    "iii ) since the choice of typical momentum flow is not unique , different choice of it may lead to extra scale uncertainties .",
    "iv ) in some sense , the present idea of including the dominant scale running effect determined by the renormalization group equation into the scale error analysis is consistent with the idea of the principle of minimum sensitivity ( pms )  @xcite , in which the renormalization scale is so set as to minimize the sensitivity of the estimation to the scale variation . that is , we observe that the scale choice of @xmath84 corresponds to a steady point for those decay widths .",
    "this also agrees with the observation of ref.@xcite , i.e. even though the pms does not satisfy the reflexivity , symmetry and transitivity properties of the renormalization group as pmc does , the pms is consistent with pmc at least at the nlo level in which its nlo coefficients are also free from @xmath98-terms .",
    "these values for the wavefunction parameters are consistent with those of ref.@xcite and those derived from the potential models such as refs .",
    "@xcite within reasonable errors . at present , the wavefunction parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 appear in the amplitude as a linear factor , so the uncertainties for the charmonium production channels can be figured out straightforwardly , thus , throughout the paper if not specially stated , we shall fix their values to be their central values .",
    ".initial renormalization scale dependence for the total cross sections of @xmath99 , where three typical initial scales are adopted .",
    "it shows that the total cross sections strongly depend on the choice of the ( initial ) scale under conventional scale setting ; while the total cross sections after pmc scale setting are almost independent of @xmath100 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     because of the exponential suppression to the pmc scale as shown by eq.([pmcscale ] ) , the lo cross section for each polarized cross section shall be increased to a certain degree , which are shown clearly in tables [ scaleun0 ] , [ scaleun1 ] and [ scaleun2 ] . defining a parameter @xmath101 , being the ratio of the cross section at nlo level to that at lo level , we find that the parameter @xmath101 are @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 channels of @xmath106 under the conventional scale setting ; which however changes down to @xmath107 and @xmath108 after pmc scale setting . for @xmath109 ,",
    "the conditions are similar .",
    "this shows that the pqcd series become more convergent after pmc scale setting .",
    "we have applied pmc scale setting to study the polarized and the unpolarized cross sections of @xmath110 up to nlo level .",
    "after pmc scale setting , we find that the final results are scale- and scheme- independent and the pqcd series becomes more convergent for both the polarized and the unpolarized cross sections .",
    "so we gain a more accurate pqcd estimation than those in the literature . more explicitly ,    * after pmc scale setting , we obtain the following total cross sections @xmath111 and @xmath112 where the errors are caused by taking the charm quark mass @xmath113 $ ] and the uncertainties of the wavefunction parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 determined by eqs.([wfval1],[wfval2],[wfval3 ] ) .",
    "our estimation for the total cross section of @xmath114 production is consistent with the experimental result , but the @xmath115 production cross section is still far less than the central value of the @xmath2-factory data  @xcite . since the data is still with large error , a future more accurate measurement shall be helpful to clarify this puzzle . *",
    "a comparison of tables [ cross - m ] , [ scaleun0 ] , [ scaleun1 ] and [ scaleun2 ] shows that @xmath116 processes are dominated by @xmath4 channel , which have been measured at the @xmath2 factories .",
    "in contrast , the contribution of the @xmath117 channels for this process seem to be rather modest even after pmc scale setting , which are about one order lower than that of @xmath118 production case .",
    "the future super @xmath2 factory , with much higher luminosity , may eventually observe these polarization patterns .",
    "* under conventional scale setting , the nlo contribution for all the channels are not small .",
    "after pmc scale setting , the pqcd convergence are greatly improved for most of the polarized and unpolarized channels .",
    "thus the unknown nnlo corrections for those channels will not changes our present estimations much , since the contributions from those unknown nnlo @xmath98-terms shall be exponentially suppressed to the present pmc scales  @xcite , which inversely guarantees the unknown conformal terms also provide less important contributions than that of the nlo conformal term .",
    "there are also cases when the pqcd convergence can not be improved even after applying the pmc scale setting . for those cases ,",
    "we really need a nnlo calculation to make the pqcd estimation more reliable , but which will also not heavily change our present estimations and conclusions .",
    "this is similar to the case of top - pair production at the hadronic colliders , where we have found that after the pmc scale setting , not only the scale dependence can be eliminated but also the pqcd convergence can be greatly improved only after finishing a nnlo calculation  @xcite .",
    "* as a cross check , by taking all the same input parameters , we exactly obtain the results listed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is found that after pmc scale setting , even though we have introduced different pmc scales for different type of cross sections caused by the different non - conformal terms , by summing up all the polarized cross sections , we can get the same result as that of the directly calculated unpolarized cross section for the case of @xmath4 and @xmath63 .",
    "this shows that our pmc procedure is self - consistent",
    ". however , there is slight difference for the case of @xmath65 .",
    "this shows that the expression for the coefficient @xmath119 listed in ref.@xcite could have some typos for the conformal terms .",
    "* it is found that after pmc scale setting , for the polarized cross sections @xmath120 ( negative even before pmc scale setting ) and @xmath121 , we obtain the  incorrect \" negative cross section .",
    "similar to the qcd pomeron case , this could be the problem of the unphysical @xmath122-scheme itself  @xcite .",
    "it has already been pointed that there is also the same  incorrect \" sign for the nlo highest eigenvalue of the bfkl equation under the @xmath123-scheme  @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the reliability of qcd predictions for the intercept of the bfkl pomeron at nlo when evaluated using the physical schemes , such as the momentum space subtraction ( mom ) scheme @xcite , can be significantly improved .",
    "+ the  incorrect \" sign for @xmath120 and @xmath121 under @xmath122 scheme may show that those unknown non - conformal terms from the nnlo or higher orders should have sizable contributions to the lo pmc scale and can not be safely neglected .",
    "in fact , the large @xmath124 factor for these two polarized cross sections shows their pqcd convergence are terrible .",
    "it is found that when we transforming the cross sections from the @xmath122 schemes to the mom scheme , such ",
    "incorrect \" sign disappears .",
    "a detailed discussion on this point shall be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "* as a final remark : @xmath116 processes provide another good example for eliminating the renormalization scale ambiguity by using the pmc .",
    "thus , after applying pmc scale setting , it will not only increase the precision of qcd tests , but also it will increase the sensitivity of the collider experiments to new physics beyond the standard model .    *",
