    "spectroscopic studies of high - redshift ( @xmath7 ) galaxies have been advanced recently .",
    "one of the largest spectroscopic samples of high - z galaxies is obtained by follow - up spectroscopy for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs : e.g. , @xcite ) which are selected by using multi - band photometric data .",
    "so far , about a thousand of optical spectra have been obtained each for lbgs at @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and star - forming galaxies at @xmath9 ( bm / bx objects : e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "intensive spectroscopic studies based on magnitude - limited samples have also identified several hundreds of galaxies at @xmath10 ( e.g. fors deep field ( fdf ) survey : @xcite , virmos - vlt deep survey : @xcite ) .",
    "these studies revealed spectroscopic features of galaxies at @xmath11 in their rest - frame uv wavelength region , and deepened our understanding of their nature .",
    "@xcite found relations between the strength of the ly@xmath2 equivalent width ( ew ) and other spectroscopic features ( e.g. , ew of the low - ionized interstellar ( lis ) metal absorption lines , uv continuum slope , velocity offset between ly@xmath2 and lis absorptions ) for the lbgs at @xmath8 , which sheds light on properties of an interstellar matter such as a gas outflow , a velocity dispersion of the gas , and a covering fraction of dust . with a part of fdf data , @xcite found that ew of the civ @xmath12 absorption line decreases from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the decrease in the ew of civ is confirmed with the full sample of fdf , and it seems to continue to @xmath15 @xcite . since the ew of civ is an indicator of the metallicity in local starburst galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the result suggests a chemical evolution of galaxies in this redshift range @xcite , although the correlation between the metallicity and the ew of civ has not been calibrated at high - redshift and thus is not ensured .",
    "near - infrared ( nir ) spectra of galaxies at @xmath11 have also been obtained and give information about kinematics and metallicity of the galaxies . the velocity offset between nebula emission lines and interstellar absorption lines",
    "is generally seen in the lbgs , suggesting the presence of the gas outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from the emissions lines , gas metallicity in the galaxies can be derived by using metallicity estimators ( the @xmath16 and the n2 index ) ; for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite derived metallicity of lbgs at @xmath8 which ranges typically from 0.1@xmath170.9 solar value .",
    "@xcite showed that majority of the seven nir bright ( @xmath18 @xmath19 mag ) bx galaxies have near the solar metallicity , and @xcite investigated the extended sample mainly with @xmath18 @xmath20 mag and found the median metallicity of 87 galaxies at @xmath9 to be about 0.5@xmath170.6 solar value .",
    "recently , surveys of galaxies at @xmath21 have been carried out ( e.g. @xcite ) , and challenges of finding galaxies even at @xmath22 have also started ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the progress of optical follow - up spectroscopy for galaxies at @xmath23 is much slower than that for galaxies at @xmath24 because objects are getting fainter , and characteristic features of uv spectrum of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , ly@xmath2 , lis absorptions ) redshift to the wavelength region where night sky emissions are very strong .",
    "although attempts of spectroscopic observations of galaxies at @xmath21 were made ( e.g. , @xcite ) , most of the galaxies were identified only with a ly@xmath2 emission because of the low signal - to - noise ratio of their continuum light .",
    "we also started an optical spectroscopy of lbgs at @xmath0 .",
    "targets were selected from our surveys for lbgs at @xmath0 ( @xcite , 2007 ) which consist of the deep and wide @xmath25 , and @xmath26-band imaging survey with the subaru / suprime - cam in the two target fields : the region including the hubble deep field - north ( the hdf - n region ) and the j0053 + 1234 region .",
    "our survey fields are quite wide ( 1290 arcmin@xmath27 in total ) , and we obtain 228 bright objects with @xmath28 mag ( @xmath29 in uv luminosity function ( uvlf ) of lbgs at @xmath0 ) .",
    "we reported an initial result of the spectroscopy for a part of the objects in the hdf - n region ( @xcite : hereafter paper i ) .",
    "thanks to the object brightness and good observing conditions , we detected continuum features of the lbgs at @xmath0 and identified the galaxies to be at @xmath0 without ly@xmath2 emission line .",
    "the most striking result was that there is no or a weak ( ew@xmath30 10 ) ly@xmath2 emission line in 7 bright lbgs identified .",
    "inspired by the result , the deficiency of the strong ly@xmath2 emission in the bright lbgs at @xmath0 was investigated by using combined data of paper i , our new results obtained in the j0053 + 1234 region , and those from the literature ; the deficiency is generally seen in the lbgs at @xmath0 and even at @xmath31 @xcite . if the quenched ly@xmath2 emission is due to the dust , this deficiency suggests that bright lbgs have larger amount of dust and higher metallicity than faint ones .",
    "this hypothesis suggests that bright lbgs experienced star formation earlier than that of faint ones : differential evolution of the high - redshift galaxies with their luminosity , although there are other possible origins of the deficiency ( e.g. , a velocity structure in / around the galaxy ) .    in this paper , we present the data of spectroscopic observation of lbgs at @xmath0 in the j0053 + 1234 region which were used in our previous paper @xcite . in section 2",
    ", we describe a sample selection , observation , and data reduction .",
    "the features of obtained spectra of the lbgs at @xmath32 in the j0053 + 1234 region are shown in section 3 . combining this result with our previous results ( paper i )",
    ", we described spectroscopic properties of bright lbgs at @xmath0 and metallicity against stellar mass in the section . throughout this paper , we adopt flat @xmath33 cosmology , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 km s@xmath37mpc@xmath37 .",
    "the magnitude system is based on ab magnitude @xcite .",
    "the photometric sample of lbgs at @xmath0 in the j0053 + 1234 region was selected based on a deep and wide broad - band ( @xmath38 and @xmath26 ) imaging survey by using subaru / suprime - cam @xcite : a total of 114 ( 236 ) candidates with @xmath39 25.0 ( 25.5 ) mag in an effective survey area ( @xmath5800 arcmin@xmath27 ) .",
    "details of imaging observations and the color selection are described in @xcite . in order to detect continuum and absorption feature , we selected the bright ( @xmath1 ) lbg candidates at @xmath0 as the main spectroscopic targets . because the entire survey field was too wide to obtain spectra for the whole sample of these lbg candidates with a limited field of view ( @xmath40 ) of the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas : @xcite ) on the subaru telescope and limited observing time , we selected a target mos field to contain the bright lbgs as many as possible . when a slit of a bright target overlapped with a slit of another bright one , we chose the object with a higher central surface brightness",
    ". finally , we designed one focas mask which covers 5 bright lbgs .",
    "the mask also covered 8 fainter ( @xmath3 mag ) lbgs which are in the gaps of the slits of main targets on the mask .",
    "spectroscopic observations with the subaru / focas were made on 2004 september 14 under a clear condition , and a seeing during the observing run was typically @xmath418 ( fwhm ) .",
    "we used a grism of 300 lines mm@xmath37 blazed at 7500    and the so58 order - cut filter ( the same setting as paper i ) , which gave wavelength coverage from 5800  to 10000(depending on a slit position on the mask ) with a pixel scale of 1.34 .",
    "the slit lengths were typically 10@xmath42 , and the",
    "slit widths were fixed to be 0.@xmath428 , giving a spectral resolution of r@xmath5700 which was measured with night sky emission lines .",
    "an exposure time of each frame was 0.5 hours , and a total effective exposure time was 6 hours .",
    "the data were reduced by using iraf with the same manner as paper i except for the re - subtraction of the night sky emissions .",
    "we subtracted bias from object frames by using an overscan region of each frame and averaged bias frame in order to remove the characteristic bias - pattern of focas ccds .",
    "flat - fielding was made with normalized average of dome - flat images .",
    "the wavelength calibration was made by using night - sky emission lines .",
    "the rms error of the wavelength calibration was @xmath43 .",
    "after the sky subtraction , the spectrum of each object was carefully aligned and averaged . because some objects show too low continuum s / n to subtract sky emission in each frame , we carried out sky subtraction after combining spectra for these objects .",
    "five pixels were binned toward wavelength direction in order to improve s / n , and one - dimensional spectra were obtained with apall task of iraf . since our objects were faint , we did not fix the aperture width for the extraction but we determined it by eye for each object to trace it well . the flux calibration and the sensitivity correction",
    "were made for the final spectra by using standard stars of wolf1346 and pg0823 + 546 .",
    "the correction for the atmospheric a and b bands was also made by tracing those absorption features in the spectra of standard stars .",
    "for some of the objects , the sky subtraction was not well achieved due to the low - s / n of the continuum or the presence of the bad column of the ccds .",
    "thus we re - subtracted the scaled night sky emissions from the one - dimensional spectrum of such objects .",
    "among 5 bright targets , we identified 2 objects to be lbgs at @xmath32 , and the resultant spectra are shown in figure 1 ( no.1 : top left , no.2 : top right ) .",
    "lbg identifications were mainly made by the presence of the continuum depression shortward of the redshifted ly@xmath2 due to the inter - galactic hi absorption and the ly@xmath2 emission line near the ly@xmath2 depression .",
    "in addition , the ly@xmath2 emission line of each object shows an asymmetric shape which is considered to be characteristic feature of lbgs and ly@xmath2 emitters ( laes ) at high - redshift .",
    "note that emission - like features in the spectrum of object no.1 at @xmath56300  and in the wavelength region longer than 7300   are the residuals of the night sky emissions since the sky subtraction was not well achieved due to the bad column in the ccd . for object",
    "no.2 , we identified some lis absorption lines ( siii @xmath441260 , oi+siii @xmath441303 , and cii @xmath441335 ) at almost the same redshift of the ly@xmath2 which are characteristic features of nearby star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and lbgs at @xmath45 ( e.g. , @xcite ; paper i ; @xcite ) , supporting the identifications of high redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "redshifts of these two bright lbgs were determined from the peak of ly@xmath2 emission : 4.797 and 4.267 for object no.1 and no.2 , respectively .",
    "the error of the redshift determination was @xmath46 .",
    "the rest of the bright sample were not identified to be at @xmath0 because of their low s / n of the spectra .",
    "these objects tend to have lower central surface brightness compared with the confirmed objects .",
    "in addition to the bright targets , we identified 2 objects among faint bonus targets with @xmath47 mag to be lbgs at @xmath32 .",
    "spectra of them are shown in figure 1 ( no.3 : bottom left , and no.4 : bottom right ) .",
    "these objects show a strong ( ew@xmath48  and @xmath5420   for object no.3 and no.4 , respectively ) single emission line ; peak of the emission corresponds to the redshift of 4.391 and 4.491 for object no.3 and no.4 , respectively if this emission is ly@xmath2",
    ". a clear asymmetry of the emission line profile and possible continuum depression shortward of the emission are seen in the spectrum of object no.4 , which supports this object is really at @xmath32 .",
    "because the redshift determinations for these objects were based only on the single emission line , we examine the possibility that they are foreground emission galaxies .",
    "for example , if object no.3 ( no.4 ) is an [ oii ] @xmath49 emitter at @xmath50 ( 0.79 ) , they should show the redshifted h@xmath51 emission line at @xmath58550(8710)and the [ oiii]@xmath445007 emission line at @xmath58810(8970)  with ew@xmath52 of @xmath570(130)  and ew@xmath52 of @xmath5110(210) , respectively by assuming the median of the observed line ratios of star - forming galaxies at @xmath53 ( 0.3 and 0.5 , respectively : @xcite ) .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , emission - like features are seen around at a part of the expected wavelengths in both spectra . however , these features are residual night - sky emissions , and there is no other significant ( ew@xmath54 ) emission lines at the expected wavelengths . thus these strong emissions",
    "are considered to be the ly@xmath2 emission from lbgs at the target redshift .",
    "we can not completely rule out the possibility that they are foreground emission galaxies by only this analysis , because some of the expected lines of foregrounds are in the wavelength region of severe night sky emissions , and the line ratios have wide object - to - object variances @xcite . but the @xmath55 colors of these objects ( 1.98 mag and 1.85 mag ) are too red to regard them as star - forming galaxies at @xmath56 ; we calculated the seds of star - forming galaxies at @xmath56 by using the population synthesis code pgase version 2 @xcite with salpeter imf @xcite and by assuming constant star formation with an age of 100 myr , which gives their @xmath55 colors in observed - frame of @xmath57 mag and @xmath58 mag for @xmath59 mag and @xmath60 mag , respectively with the dust extinction curve by @xcite .",
    "thus we consider both of the objects are at @xmath32 .        figure 2 shows the positions of observed objects in the @xmath61 and @xmath62 two - color diagram from the present results and paper i. photometric properties of spectroscopically identified lbgs at @xmath32 in the j0053 + 1234 region are summarized in table 1 .",

    "filled squares show bright lbgs at @xmath0 in our previous results ( paper i ) .",
    "open triangles and open - inverse triangles show bright lbg candidates unidentified in our present observation and the previous results , respectively .",
    "so far , no bright spectroscopic targets ( total of 22 lbg candidates ) have been identified as foreground galaxies , though a half of them were not identified due to the low - s / n of their spectra . in order to examine our color selection criteria",
    "further , we also show the positions of the galactic m stars which were identified in our previous observations as filled pentagons in figure 2 .",
    "our selection criteria for lbgs at @xmath0 are reasonable to exclude interlopers , though more large and systematic spectroscopic observations are desirable .",

    "the distribution is calculated based on the expected detection rates of the lbgs against the apparent magnitude and the redshift for each survey field ( figure 6 by @xcite ) .",
    "however , the detection rates were derived through simulations in the two - color diagram to estimate the completeness of the photometric catalog , and they do not include the difference of survey volumes for each redshift bin and the difference of the number density at the corresponding uv magnitude for an apparent magnitude at each redshift bin . in order to derive the expected distribution and compare it with the observed redshift distribution of the spectroscopic sample , we corrected the detection rates by adopting the redshift bin size of @xmath66 and assuming the uvlf of the @xmath0 lbgs @xcite .",
    "since almost all our spectroscopic sample covers @xmath26 magnitude brighter than 25.5 mag , we calculated the expected redshift distributions for three magnitude ranges of 24.0@xmath1724.5 mag , 24.5@xmath1725.0 mag , and 25.0@xmath1725.5 mag for each field , and took the average of them .",
    "the distribution of spectroscopically confirmed lbgs is broadly consistent with the expected distribution , but there seems to be a deficiency of the lbgs at around @xmath67 .",
    "although the sample size is still small and the deficiency may not be significant , this may be due to the presence of severe night sky emission lines which prevent us from detecting the continuum depression and/or ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "the night sky emission lines whose wavelengths are converted to the redshifts corresponding to the redshift of ly@xmath2 are also shown with dotted line in the figure ; the sky emission lines are severe for the redshifts larger than 4.9 .",
    "as described in section 3.1 , spectroscopically identified lbgs in the j0053 region have redshifts of @xmath68 with a mean of 4.5 , which is slightly lower than that of the objects in paper i with redshifts of @xmath69 ( mean value of 4.7 ) .",

    ". it should be worth noting that the lis lines are saturated , and ew(lis ) reflects not only the metallicity but also the velocity structure and covering fraction of the gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite show a composite rest - frame uv spectrum of objects at @xmath9 with a mean stellar mass of @xmath122 and mean metallicity of 12+log(o / h)@xmath123 derived from n2 index method .",
    "the ew(lis ) in the spectrum is @xmath124corresponding to 12+log(o / h ) of @xmath125 if we use the local relation by @xcite .",
    "the result suggests that the local ew(lis)-metallicity relation may systematically underestimate the metallicity of galaxies at high redshift .",
    "we derived the individual metallicity for 8 lbgs at @xmath0 with the lis absorption in this study and paper i with the same manner mentioned above .",
    "for the 3 objects in the hdf - n region among the 8 lbgs , subaru / cisco @xmath126 band data and spitzer / irac mid - ir data are available , and we can estimate their stellar masses by fitting their rest - frame uv to optical seds to the model seds .",

    "the metallicities ( 12+log(o / h ) ) of 104268 ( no.1 of paper i ) , 144200 ( no.2 of paper i ) , and 148198 ( no.8 of paper i ) are 7.7@xmath127 , 7.7@xmath127 , and 8.7@xmath128 , respectively . for the stellar mass estimation",
    ", we adopted the same manner used in @xcite .",
    "we used the pgase version 2 population synthesis model @xcite with salpeter imf @xcite , constant star formation history , an the calzetti s dust extinction curve @xcite to make model spectra .",
    "igm absorptions were calculated for the given redshift by using the analytic formula by @xcite . then the observed seds were fit to model seds , and the best fit model was obtained by minimizing @xmath129 .",
    "resultant stellar masses ( best fit value with 68% confidence level ) of the objects 104268 , 144200 , and 148198 are 5.82@xmath130 , 3.33@xmath131 , and 1.33@xmath132 , respectively .    in figure 5 ,",
    "open circles represent the stellar masses and the metallicities of the three luminous lbgs at @xmath0 , and filled circle represents the average value of them .",
    "pluses , diamonds , and triangles show the data for galaxies at @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath9 , respectively @xcite , which show the presence of mass - metallicity relation at each redshift and its evolution from @xmath9 to @xmath135 .",
    "@xcite was derived from n2 index ( e.g. , @xcite ) which is different from methods used by @xcite and @xcite and may have a problems in calibration ( e.g. , @xcite ) which may partly be a cause for the offset . ]",
    "although the uncertainties are quite large ( and may contain some systematics ) , and our way of metallicity estimation is different from those for galaxies at other redshifts , the metallicities of the lbgs at @xmath0 tend to be lower than those of the galaxies with the same stellar mass at @xmath136.1.8 times smaller ( e.g. , @xcite ) in figure 5 in order to compare them with the data by @xcite . ]",

    "<S> we present the results of spectroscopy of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath0 in the j0053 + 1234 field with the faint object camera and spectrograph on the subaru telescope . among 5 bright candidates with @xmath1 mag , </S>",

    "<S> the ews of ly@xmath2 emission of the 2 lbgs are not so strong to be detected as ly@xmath2 emitters , and one of them shows strong low - ionized interstellar ( lis ) metal absorption lines . two faint objects with @xmath3 mag are also confirmed to be at @xmath0 , and their spectra show strong ly@xmath2 emission in contrast to the bright ones . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest a deficiency of strong ly@xmath2 emission in bright lbgs at @xmath0 , which has been discussed in our previous paper . </S>",
    "<S> combined with our previous spectra of lbgs at @xmath0 obtained around the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) , we made a composite spectrum of uv luminous ( @xmath4 mag ) lbgs at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant spectrum shows a weak ly@xmath2 emission and strong lis absorptions which suggests that the bright lbgs at @xmath0 have chemically evolved at least to @xmath50.1 solar metallicity . for a part of our sample in the hdf - n region </S>",
