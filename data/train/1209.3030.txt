    "non - trivial structure of the vacuum state is among the most profound predictions of quantum field theory .",
    "the properties of the vacuum are manifested in its response to different external perturbations .",
    "the imposition of boundary conditions on a quantum field is among the simplest models for the perturbation .",
    "the boundary conditions may be induced by real material media or represent non - trivial topology of the space . in both cases",
    "they modify the structure of the quantum vacuum thus affecting the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of physical observables .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the casimir effect ( for reviews see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present paper we consider combined effects from boundaries and non - trivial topology on the properties of the fermionic vacuum in the cosmic string spacetime .",
    "the cosmic strings are predicted to be formed within the framework of grand unified theories as a result of symmetry braking phase transitions vile94 .",
    "this type of phase transitions have several cosmological consequences and provide an important link between particle physics and cosmology .",
    "although the recent observational data on the cosmic microwave background radiation have ruled out cosmic strings as the primary source for primordial density perturbations , they are still candidates for the generation of a number of interesting physical effects such as the generation of gravitational waves , gamma ray bursts , high energy cosmic rays , and enhanced baryon number violation .",
    "recently , cosmic strings attracted a renewed interest partly because a variant of their formation mechanism is proposed in the framework of brane inflation @xcite ( for a review of the existence of cosmic strings in string theory models see cope11 ) .    at distances larger than the core radius , the spacetime geometry for a straight cosmic string",
    "is well approximated by a flat spacetime with a planar angle deficit . in quantum field theory , the corresponding non - trivial topology gives rise to the polarization of the quantum vacuum .",
    "this problem has been studied in many papers for scalar , fermionic and electromagnetic fields @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the vacuum polarization by a cosmic string in various curved backgrounds has been discussed in davi88,beze09,otte10,beze12a .",
    "another type of vacuum polarization arises by the presence of boundaries on which the field operator obeys some prescribed boundary condition .",
    "the analysis of the boundary - induced quantum effects in the cosmic string spacetime have been developed for scalar beze06sc , nest11 , fermionic @xcite , and electromagnetic fields @xcite for the geometry of a coaxial cylindrical boundary . from the point of view of the physics in the exterior region ,",
    "the latter can be considered as a simplified model for the nontrivial core of the cosmic string .",
    "the casimir force for massless scalar fields subject to dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions in the setting of the conical piston has been recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "the casimir densities for scalar and electromagnetic fields induced by flat boundaries perpendicular to the string have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the topological effects in the generalized cosmic string geometry with a compact dimension along its axis are investigated in @xcite .",
    "combined effects of topology and boundaries on the casimir - polder force acting on a polarizable microparticle situated near the cosmic string have been studied in @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that due to the nontrivial topology this force can be repulsive .",
    "continuing in this line of investigations , in the present paper we consider the polarization of the fermionic vacuum by a flat boundary perpendicular to the string axis on which the field operator is constrained by mit bag boundary condition .",
    "we evaluate the fermionic condensate ( fc ) and the vev of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "these quantities are among the most important characteristics of the vacuum state .",
    "although the corresponding operators are local , they carry an important information about the global properties of the background spacetime .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source in einstein s equations and , therefore , it plays an important role in modelling a self - consistent dynamics which involves the gravitational field .",
    "the fc is crucial in the models of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and in considerations of the stability of fermionic vacuum .",
    "as it will be shown below , in the problem under consideration all calculations can be performed in a closed form and it constitutes an example in which the topological and boundary - induced polarizations of the vacuum can be separated in different contributions . note that a conical space appears as an effective background geometry in the long - wavelength description of certain condensed matter systems such as crystals , liquid crystals and quantum liquids @xcite .",
    "the results described in this paper may shed light on the features of the boundary - induced effects in this type of medium with a conical defect .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the geometry of the problem and a complete set of positive- and negative - energy four - spinors obeying the bag boundary condition on the plate is constructed . in section [ sec : fc ] these mode functions are applied for the evaluation of the fc .",
    "similar calculations for the vev of the energy - momentum tensor are presented in section [ sec : emt ] .",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the technical details for the evaluation of the energy density and the azimuthal stress are described in appendix [ sec : appendix ] .",
