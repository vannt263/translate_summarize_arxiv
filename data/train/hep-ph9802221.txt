    "the strong cp problem is without question one of the most important problems faced by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "its origin lies in the necessity of adding the so - called @xmath4 term to the effective qcd lagrangian due to the contribution of instantons present in the topologically nontrivial qcd vacuum@xcite : @xmath5 where the dual field strength is given by @xmath6 . through the anomaly in the axial @xmath7 current of qcd , chiral u(1 )",
    "transformations lead to shifts in @xmath4 , leaving the physical combination @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the quark mass matrix .",
    "since @xmath10 clearly violates cp , it gives a strong interaction contribution to the neutron electric dipole moment@xcite and leads to the experimental contraint @xmath11 the real problem therefore is one of naturalness or fine - tuning : why is @xmath1 so incredibly small ?",
    "there are currently three notable classes of possible solutions to this problem : ( 1 ) vanishing up quark mass , ( 2 ) the axion@xcite or ( 3 ) cp conservation and subsequent spontaneous breaking .",
    "the first and simplest possibility appears to be disfavored by current algebra relations between pseudoscalar meson masses@xcite , but is still controversial ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) . of these",
    ", the most popular is the invisible axion alternative@xcite .",
    "here one introduces a global chiral @xmath12 ( peccei - quinn@xcite ) symmetry which is spontaneously broken at a high energy scale @xmath13 and explicitly broken by instantons .",
    "the @xmath4 parameter is replaced by a dynamical field  a pseudo goldstone boson of the @xmath12  whose potential dynamically relaxes @xmath1 to zero .",
    "the advantage of this scheme is that it is simple , generic and has observable consequences both in terrestrial experiments and in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "astrophysical constraints from axion - induced cooling during stellar evolution@xcite and effects on the neutrino signal from supernova 1987a@xcite give a lower bound , @xmath14 gev , while a cosmological upper bound of @xmath15 gev is given by the contribution to the universal energy density of the vacuum energy associated with @xmath12 breaking as the axion vacuum expectation value relaxes to zero@xcite .",
    "on the aesthetic side , one may complain that we are merely replacing the @xmath1 fine - tuning problem with another : the smallness of the ratio of the weak scale to the @xmath12 breaking scale @xmath16 .",
    "another possible problem is the dependence of the solution on a global symmetry , generally not preserved by gravity , so not likely to appear from a more fundamental theory .",
    "this appears to be a significant problem@xcite , at least in einstein gravity .",
    "however , it has been argued that gravitational violations of global symmetries may be suppressed in certain extensions , including string theories@xcite , where at least the universal dilaton - axion is always present .",
    "the axion alternative also does not provide an explanation of weak cp violation . here",
    "one must assume the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) origin of cp violating phases .",
    "of course the ultimate test is to detect actually an axion@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the third alternative .",
    "that is , we will assume that the fundamental theory of nature preserves cp and that at sub - planck energies it is spontaneously broken . indeed there is evidence that cp has its origin as a gauge symmetry remnant of superstring theories@xcite . in this manner",
    "the smallness of @xmath1 reflects the existence of an underlying symmetry .",
    "such models were first constructed in the context of grand unified theories ( guts ) by nelson and refined by barr@xcite and incorporate extra heavy quarks which mix with the observed quarks .",
    "then , relying on specific symmetries , one can obtain a texture of the full quark mass matrices which guarantee the tree - level vanishing of @xmath1 after the spontaneous cp violation ( scpv ) . after integrating out the heavy fields ,",
    "the low energy quark mass matrices contain the usual km phase .",
    "the generic difficulty with these models comes from the need to ensure that large contributions to @xmath1 do not arise at higher loops , while at the same time having sufficient weak cp violation from the km phase .",
    "thus while the scpv approach is conceptually rather simple , it is not so generic and requires careful model building .    given some of the tantalizing hints of low energy supersymmetry and the plausible gauge origin of cp symmetry ,",
    "it is worthwhile to attempt to construct a supersymmetric ( susy ) model with a nelson - barr type mechanism for solving the strong cp problem .",
    "the scpv feature then also resolves the so - called susy phases problem .",
    "the latter problem was originally described in the context of a minimal supergravity origin of the soft susy breaking terms@xcite , and is usually worse in a general susy breaking scenario .",
    "there are two extra phases in the universal soft mass parameters , beyond @xmath17 and @xmath1 , which give cp violating effects in the low energy effective theory .",
    "these can be written as effective phases in the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath3 of the trilinear and bilinear soft susy breaking scalar terms , respectively , given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the universal gaugino mass .",
    "the problem is that from 1-loop diagrams involving squarks , these phases must be fine - tuned to order @xmath21 ",
    "@xmath22 to satisfy the limit on the neutron electric dipole moment unless all the superpartners are `` heavy '' , @xmath23 tev . with cp",
    "spontaneously broken in a sector independent of susy breaking , these phases would be naturally zero at first order .",
    "attempts to realize the nelson - barr mechanism in susy models@xcite have , however , run up against a formidable difficulty : there generically exist potentially large 1-loop contributions to @xmath1 in these models@xcite .",
    "the dangerous diagrams are shown in fig.1 , where now in the supersymmetric case @xmath1 also gets contributions from the argument of the gluino mass ( fig.1b ) : @xmath24 as discussed at length in ref .",
    "@xcite , one requires an exceptionally high degree of proportionality of the soft susy breaking trilinear scalar couplings to their associated yukawa couplings as well as degeneracy among the soft squark mass terms for each charge and color sector , if these contributions are to be sufficiently suppressed .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that when the quark and squark mass matrices are diagonalized by the same set of unitary matrices , no phase can appear in the diagrams of fig.1 .",
    "the degree of proportionality and degeneracy required among the soft susy breaking parameters is very difficult to maintain due to the effects of renormalization .",
    "so , is scpv doomed to be disfavored as a solution to the strong cp problem in supersymmetric models ?",
    "we will argue that models with a specifically modified nelson - barr mechanism together with the recently popular gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) scenario@xcite can overcome the difficulty .",
    "the gmsb scenario ensures that the soft masses at the intrinsic susy breaking scale @xmath25 are proportional and degenerate , while renormalization effects that violate these conditions are reduced by having to run soft masses and couplings from the messenger scale @xmath26 tev instead of the reduced planck mass @xmath27 gev . in the minimal version of such gmsb models@xcite ,",
    "the @xmath18- and @xmath3-terms are zero at @xmath25 .",
    "this tends to give additional suppression of the dangerous contributions to @xmath1 .",
    "however , large third generation yukawa couplings can still lead to significant violations of proportionality and degeneracy and a detailed numerical analysis of the situation is necessary to determine if the supersymmetric nelson - barr type models are viable solutions to the strong cp problem .",
    "we will answer this in the affirmative with what to our knowledge is the only full renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of such models in the literature .",
    "the models to be discussed here have cp spontaneously broken at low energies ( of order a tev ) , and a source of weak cp violation distinct from that in the standard model , namely the exchange of a new u(1 ) gauge boson , the symmetry of which enforces the nelson - barr texture .",
    "the km phase is very small .",
    "this makes it possible to account for the smallness of @xmath1 without making weak cp violation inconsistent with observations . in the susy - gut nelson - barr models ,",
    "even with gauge - mediated susy breaking , one predicts a too large @xmath1 if the experimental requirement that @xmath28 is imposed .",
    "moreover , one has a richer and quite distinct phenomenology .",
    "the extra quarks and other fields needed to construct the nelson - barr texture and break cp will be within the reach of future accelerators .",
    "a non - supersymmetric version of the type of model is the aspon model@xcite .",
    "the situation with susy incorporated is first discussed in ref.@xcite where its advantage over the generic susy nelson - barr type models is highlighted . another possible advantage for",
    "such low scale models would arise if it were somehow possible to imbed the sector responsible for the nelson - barr texture in the susy breaking and messenger sectors .",
    "an immediate disadvantage of this approach is that by breaking cp at low energies , one introduces a serious domain wall problem@xcite .",
    "however , this can be solved via a period of inflation just above the weak scale .",
    "indeed , in the susy context , some authors have argued that this type of inflation can be natural@xcite and desirable for other reasons ( _ e.g. _ as a solution to the cosmological moduli problem ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section 2 , the considerations leading to viable models for solving the strong and supersymmetric cp problems are discussed .",
    "we also note some intriguing alternatives worthy of further consideration .",
    "we give in section 3 a detailed summary of the dangerous 1-loop contributions to @xmath1 and their dependence on proportionality and squark - degeneracy violating mass insertions .",
    "the question of the detailed structure of the spontaneous cp breaking part of the superpotential is taken up in section 4 .",
    "we emphasize its importance in determining certain dangerous contributions to @xmath1 and present a minimal example we use in further analysis . the renormalization group analysis used to estimate the @xmath1 contributions",
    "is described in section 5 and the full numerical results presented .",
    "some remarks on related questions of interest are presented in the conclusion .",
    "we assume full cp symmetry in the visible sector , including the soft susy breaking terms , down to energies where spontaneous cp breaking occurs . from eq.([thetabarsusy ] ) we see that there should be no tree - level phases in the quark mass determinant , nor in the susy breaking gluino mass .",
    "the latter holds by assumption and the former is obtained through a nelson - barr texture . to obtain the texture",
    ", we introduce an extra heavy right - handed down quark superfield @xmath29 together with its mirror @xmath30 coupling to the ordinary down quarks via the superpotential @xmath31 where the vevs of the scalar components of @xmath32 contain a relative phase , thus breaking cp .",
    "the details of the superpotential accomplishing this are postponed to section 4 , and here it is sufficient to note that at least two @xmath33 fields are necessary , since one phase can always be absorbed by a field redefinition of the extra quarks . after cp and @xmath34 breaking , we have the down sector fermion mass matrix : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the usual @xmath2 down sector mass matrix and @xmath37 is a complex @xmath38-vector with components @xmath39 , and the real parameter @xmath40 is defined such that @xmath37 is normalized to 1 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath41@xmath42 .",
    "the magnitude of mixing between the ordinary quarks and the extra singlet is characterized by @xmath40 . clearly the determinant of @xmath43 is real and at energies below @xmath44 the low energy effective theory has a km phase of at most order @xmath40 . without some additional source for weak cp violation ,",
    "this must be @xmath45 and as we shall see this in turn makes the suppression of 1-loop contributions to @xmath1 problematic .",
    "scenario is discarded in the analysis of ref.@xcite . ] for this reason , we shall assume that cp is broken at relatively low scales with a nonstandard mechanism for weak cp violation .",
    "the specific form of the mass matrix in eq.([mf ] ) can be enforced by a variety of symmetries , though by the non - renormalization theorems , the nelson - barr texture is not upset by renormalization of terms in the superpotential . in the aspon scenario , as discussed in ref.@xcite , the @xmath30 , @xmath29 and @xmath32 can be given charges @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , under a new gauged u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "the major source of weak cp violation , in the @xmath48 system for instance , then comes from exchange of the new u(1 ) gauge boson ( aspon ) which becomes massive at the scale where cp is spontaneously broken .",
    "this places an upper bound on the mass scale of cp breaking of @xmath49 .",
    "more important in our susy version , this allows the parameter @xmath40 to be small , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath50 , which contributes significantly in suppression @xmath1 from loop corrections .",
    "note that we will need at least some extra mirror partners for @xmath32 superfields to cancel the gauge anomaly introduced by their fermionic components .",
    "if the nelson - barr texture is obtained from a discrete / global symmetry , one must rely on superbox diagrams involving gluino and chargino exchange to generate @xmath51 ; a scenario recently re - analyzed in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite .",
    "however , in present setting , this proves very difficult to do .",
    "this is unfortunate since it is easier to construct unifiable models in this latter case . ) .",
    "the same thing can be done to make the aspon model gut - compatible , but unifying the extra u(1 ) with the other gauge interactions is not possible . ]    when susy is broken we generate nonzero gaugino masses and soft scalar bilinear and trilinear couplings , and @xmath52 , are also commonly written as products of the @xmath18-parameters and the corresponding yukawa couplings , _",
    "e.g. _ elements of the @xmath53 matrix correspond to @xmath54 ( no sum ) .",
    "] including the following terms relevant for the down - sector analysis [ a complete description is given in eqs.([mssmsoft],[extrasoft ] ) ] : @xmath55 the general form of the down squark mass matrix can be written as , @xmath56 where @xmath57 in the expression for @xmath58 we have used @xmath59 where @xmath60 is normalized to 1 and @xmath61 is the @xmath62-term for the @xmath32 field , which depends on the specific form of the soft susy breaking mass terms related to the spontaneous cp breaking part of the superpotential .",
    "the form of these squark mass matrices will be critical in the calculation of @xmath1 in the next section .",
    "in particular , the @xmath63 s bear complex phases independent of those in the @xmath64 s in a generic setting , and hence constitute a major source of trouble .",
    "we have implicitly assumed in the above that the sectors responsible for the nelson - barr texture and cp breaking are disjoint from those involved in the intrinsic breaking of supersymmetry . since the successful example model we focus on has gauge - mediated susy breaking at a relatively low scale @xmath25 ,",
    "it is _ a priori _ possible that all or part of the extra field content and symmetries required for the nelson - barr mechanism is contained in the susy breaking hidden and messenger sectors .",
    "although this is an intriguing possibility , we have not been able to construct viable models of this type thus far .",
    "actually , there appears to be an intrinsic incompatibility between the role a field takes in cp violation and the one it takes in susy breaking , as far as constraining @xmath1 is concerned .",
    "recall that in gmsb , the scalar particles get their soft susy breaking masses from the gauge interactions they share with the messenger sector particles which see susy breaking directly .",
    "the squark masses in each sector , for instance , would then be degenerate , as the process is flavor blind .",
    "the extra singlet @xmath29 introduced here may easily upset the situation .",
    "naively , the best strategy is to make the gmsb also blind to the aspon u(1 ) .",
    "we will see below that this happens to have a even more important merit  it guarantees the suppression of the very dangerous @xmath65 s .",
    "in other words , hiding the cp - breaking sector from susy breaking helps to suppress the susy loop contributions to @xmath1 .",
    "this is the less ambitious strategy we have taken in the model analyzed in detail below .",
    "here we review and extend the work in refs.@xcite to compute the 1-loop contributions to @xmath1 of figs.1a and 1b , using the mass - insertion approximation@xcite .",
    "these results are generally valid for any type of low energy scpv model , with or without the u(1)@xmath66 .",
    "the scale , @xmath67 , and hence the characteristic scale of the scpv , here is chosen near or below @xmath68 , the average squark mass . this is more or less dictated by the aspon scenario of weak cp@xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath29 superfields are handled on the same footing as the other quark superfields .",
    "the analysis is basically the same as that given in ref.@xcite except here we pay full attention to the explicit phase factors and family indices , and also treat the @xmath69 term , as given by eq.([mrloffdiag ] ) , in full detail .",
    "these turn out to be very important in understanding how the scenario can provide a feasible solution . in taking the large @xmath67 limit , which corresponds to situation discussed in ref.@xcite",
    ", one has to be careful in handling the loop momentum integrals properly .",
    "the latter are however not explicitly given in this paper , though they are included in our numerical computations .",

    "this full formula , while it can be used in the numerical calculations once all the quantities involved are known , hides its physics content behind the @xmath74-matrix elements . in the limit of exact degeneracy and proportionality ,",
    "the latter is just the identity matrix and @xmath1 is zero .",
    "otherwise , the mass - insertion approximation , as discussed below , is more illustrative .",

    "explicit forms of the matrices needed to diagonalize @xmath81 are useful .",
    "expressions up to order @xmath82 are available in the literature@xcite . to parametrize the effect of proportionality violation among the three families , we write @xmath83 the situation for the related parameter in the @xmath84-@xmath30 mixings is more complicated . recall that @xmath85 [ eq.([mrloffdiag ] ) ] .",
    "it has been emphasized in ref.@xcite that the @xmath62-terms being small is paramount to the success of any model of the nelson - barr type .",
    "these terms are dangerous because in general one has no reason to expect these @xmath62-terms to obey even an approximate proportionality ( to the @xmath86 terms ) . on the contrary , contributions of the other part to @xmath1 can be interpreted as a proportionality violation among the @xmath87 s by writing @xmath88 the term proportional to @xmath89 does not contribute .",
    "we further introduce the simplified notation : @xmath90 where complex vector @xmath91 is normalized to 1 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath92    in terms of the above notation , the list of major contributions to @xmath1 is given in tables 1a and 1b .",
    "the @xmath1 contributions involving @xmath69 are complicated . to make it easier to see the effects of the different parts , we list some of those terms in tables before and after the above mentioned splitting .",
    "for example , entry 1 in the table  1a is split into two parts : the first part is a proportionality violation effect involving @xmath93 and im(@xmath94 ) ( both are suppressed in our model ) , the second is the @xmath62-term contribution ( @xmath95 ) , where the relevant complex phase is taken to be @xmath96 .",
    "one other notable feature among the @xmath1 contributions is the combination @xmath97 , as shown in entry 9 of table  1b .",
    "when the @xmath98 term is split as above , the second term actually can be combined with the first term in eq.([mfiveb ] ) to give @xmath99 , which can be interpreted as a proportionality violation among the corresponding trilinear and bilinear terms .",
    "the other parts involve @xmath93 and @xmath95 , as explicitly shown in the table .",
    "all other entries with a @xmath69 can be split and interpreted in the same way .",
    "we will see in the final result that the @xmath62-term contribution _ is the most dangerous_.",
    "spontaneous breaking of the u(1)@xmath66 symmetry is the only source of cp violation in our model .",
    "this cp violation effect feeds directly into the @xmath100 and @xmath69 terms in the quark and squark mass matrices , with complex phase vectors @xmath37 and @xmath60 , respectively . to implement the mechanism , we need a sector of u(1)@xmath66-charged sm singlet superfield with a superpotential that not only gives rise to the complex @xmath101 s , but also gives us a good control on the dangerous @xmath102 s .",
    "soft susy breaking terms should also be taken into consideration , when determining the true scalar potential .",
    "the @xmath62-terms , of course , characterize susy breaking .",
    "we consider the scenario in which the messengers communicating susy breaking to the visible sector are u(1)@xmath66-blind , _",
    "i.e. _ they do not carry any u(1)@xmath66 charges ; furthermore , they are not directly coupled to the cp - breaking sector .",
    "the superfields of the latter are then hidden from susy breaking .",
    "we have to consider at least five superfields , two @xmath103 s of conjugate u(1)@xmath66 charges to the @xmath32 s and a singlet @xmath104 , in order to have both gauge anomaly cancellation and a possible cp violating vacuum solution@xcite .",
    "we consider the superpotential without the @xmath105-terms is suggested .",
    "while that could have a cp violating vacuum with susy preserved , the situation is not as general and natural as the one considered here , and would have to rely on a linear @xmath104 term to fix the symmetry breaking scale . ]",
    "@xmath106 the five @xmath62-flat conditions yield four independent equations , which , together with the @xmath30-flat condition , give a unique vacuum solution",
    ". the solution is cp violating for most of the parameter space .",
    "hence , neglecting the soft susy breaking terms , we have a susy preserving vacuum that breaks cp .",
    "the gmsb scenario we considered allows the unwanted soft susy breaking terms of the sector to be zero at @xmath25 .",
    "they are , however , generated through rg evolution , as discussed in the next section . with their nonvanishing values taken into consideration , the scalar potential is then given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 solving for the potential minimum to determine the @xmath65 values is not tractable , as @xmath109 and @xmath110 involves a large number of parameters which are not otherwise constrained , apart from yielding a cp violating solution",
    "however , one can easily obtain a reasonable order of magnitude estimate of the shifts in the @xmath65 s as a result of including the small @xmath110 terms .",
    "for example , the equation @xmath111 suggests that @xmath112 ( here we drop all indices and phases ) is given by the magnitude of @xmath113 an alternative way to estimate the @xmath65 s is given by the susy breaking diagrams shown in fig.2 . here figs.2a and 2b give exactly the same results as the first two terms listed above .",
    "figure  2c , however , gives the estimate @xmath114 .",
    "for perturbative values of the @xmath115 coupling , this is of course smaller than the third estimate in eq.([fest ] ) , hence we neglect it .",
    "a similar diagram , fig.2d , also suggests a contribution @xmath116 , though the @xmath117 dependence of the @xmath118 s is implicitly incorporated into the generation of the @xmath110 terms through rg running .",
    "we will use all these in our numerical estimates to determine whether the @xmath62-term is sufficiently small that its contributions to @xmath1 , listed in tables 1 and 2 , are under control .",
    "finally , we emphasize again that the complex phases in the @xmath65 s are not related to those of the @xmath101 s directly .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , we need a full theory for the soft susy breaking parameters to see if the @xmath1 constraints can be satisfied and the gmsb scenario may provide the only viable possibility . in particular , we use here only the minimal version of such a theory @xcite .",
    "this version has a few special merits : it provides practically a one - parameter model of soft susy breaking , radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry is naturally implemented and , within the mssm framework , it has been studied with extensive renormalization group analysis and shown to be compatible with all known experimental constraints@xcite . from our perspective of solving the strong cp problem by augmenting the @xmath119 sector , it actually represents a relatively demanding setting among gmsb models , where a large @xmath120 allows all the yukawa couplings of the third family to have substantial effects on the rg - runnings .",
    "a smaller @xmath120 in general would only make it easier to satisfy the @xmath1 constraints .",
    "we will refrain from elaborating extensively on the details of the gmsb model or the rg - analysis itself . for more specific details on finding the correct electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum and meeting other experimental constraints in the minimal gmsb model ,",
    "readers are referred to ref.@xcite .",
    "_ our interest here is in adapting the machinery to our extended model at a level of sufficient sophistication to calculate @xmath1 to 1-loop and establish our solution to the strong cp problem . _",
    "we use 1-loop renormalization group equations ( rge s ) with naive step thresholds between @xmath121 and @xmath25 .",
    "the rg - improved tree level higgs potential is considered in finding the electroweak - symmetry breaking solution .",
    "the rge s for the extra content of the model are also implemented at the 1-loop level ; relevant formulae are in appendix a. the @xmath119 , and hence cp symmetry , breaking is imposed by hand .",
    "the idea is to study the general situation independent of the details of the scpv sector , as the latter is to a certain extent more flexible and less constrained .",
    "it is important to note that the extra superfield content in the model is partially decoupled from the mssm part , with the only direct coupling being gauge couplings of @xmath30 and @xmath29 , and the small yukawa couplings @xmath87 .",
    "the computation concerning the scpv sector , as well as the rg analysis can certainly be made more sophisticated , however , we consider our treatment sufficient for our purpose . in the sample analysis for which numerical results are presented in this paper in detail ( appendix  b and the last column of table  1 ) ,",

    "to simplify the situation , we input all these mass parameters as @xmath139 and all dimensionless couplings as random numbers in the range @xmath140 , for the sample calculation .",
    "this oversimplification certainly begs the question of consistency of the vacuum solution for this sector , or the whole model .",
    "however , in the small @xmath40 domain of interest , the influence of the extra ingredients on the values of the other mssm parameters is insignificant , as to be expected .",
    "the only practical effect of those parameters is in the rg evolution of the related soft terms which we needed to estimate the @xmath118 s .",
    "we have checked , for instance , that the particular input values used in the sample run reported here does lead to generic magnitudes of the latter .",
    "appendix b contains a collection of some of the numerical results , while those for the @xmath1 contributions , _ without _ the @xmath141 s are listed in the last column of table 1 .",
    "estimates of the @xmath118 , following the discussion in the previous section , and their contribution to @xmath1 are given in table 2 ( second column ) .",
    "the latter can be easily checked using the @xmath118 value and the listing of @xmath69-terms in table 1 .",
    "we also list in table 2 results from a number of different runs with different values of the @xmath117 s ( reflected by the @xmath40-value obtained ) and @xmath115 s .",
    "the former , which can have a significant effect on the various mssm parameters , are restricted by @xmath142 ",
    "@xmath143 from the weak cp considerations .",
    "our results indicate that only a relatively large value of @xmath40 can upset the strong cp solution , by first driving @xmath118 too large ( see column 4 of table 2 ) .",
    "one should be cautious in using this result quantitatively , as our @xmath118 estimates are meant to be conservative upper bounds .",
    "however , the result is certainly illustrative of the importance of the @xmath112 in estimating @xmath1 . with @xmath40",
    "restricted to the workable range , the basic features of the rge solutions are quite stable .",
    "this is true even with a relatively large variation of the @xmath115 s , as illustrated by column 5 and 6 of table 2 .",
    "note that though the @xmath144 term may have an explicit dependence on @xmath115 , its numerical value does not have a large variation with @xmath115 as one might naively expect .",
    "this is , like the approximate proportionality of a general @xmath18-term , a natural result of the rg equations .",
    "all in all , the @xmath62-term contributions to @xmath1 dominate , and the overall @xmath1 value is comfortably within the required bound for the major region of the parameter space of our model under consideration , hence solving the strong cp problem .",
    "to recapitulate , we discussed a complete spontaneous cp violation model with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking and why this type of model is particularly favored over a generic supersymmetric scpv model in solving the strong cp problem .",
    "results from numerical rge studies are used to explicitly establish the feasibility of the approach .",
    "the treatment of parameters in the scpv sector is admittedly oversimplified .",
    "the correlations between @xmath40 and @xmath67 , and between the various mass parameters at the @xmath67 scale and the values of the various @xmath115 coupling , for instance , are neglected .",
    "however , it is easy to see from our discussion that such details are not going to change the essential features of our results , though they would determine explicitly the specific  large-@xmath40 \" region of the parameter space that could be ruled out .",
    "the model has a rich spectrum of new particles at the @xmath67 or scpv scale .",
    "until such experimental data become available , a detailed study of the parameter space may not be feasible .    while the weak cp aspects of this model have been analyzed in the non - supersymmetric setting as in ref .",
    "@xcite , susy particles could lead to new contributions through super - box and penguin diagrams .",
    "these contributions are in general subdominant , as are the standard model box diagrams .",
    "our model predicts a measureable neutron edm , which could be close to the present experimental bound for @xmath145 .",
    "the model also has an extra pair of vector - like quark superfields , a new gauge boson , and a number of neutral fermions and scalars with no direct couplings to the standard model gauge bosons , all with masses around the tev scale .",
    "this scale is dictated by the weak cp phenomenology .",
    "hence it offers a rich spectrum of new particles to be discovered at the cern large hadron collider . because the @xmath2 cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix is approximately real",
    ", the model also predicts a flat unitarity triangle and the absence of substantial cp violation in the @xmath3 system at future @xmath3 factories@xcite .",
    "moreover , there will be a lack of any substantial cp violating effects in the up - quark sector .",

    "<S> we show that a gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking sector can provide the needed degeneracy and proportionality , though that proves to be a problem for generic nelson - barr models . </S>",
    "<S> the workable model we consider here has the nelson - barr mass texture enforced by a gauge symmetry ; one also expects a new u(1 ) gauge superfield with mass in the tev range . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting model is predictive . </S>",
    "<S> we predict a measureable neutron edm and the existence of extra vector - like quark superfields which can be discovered at the cern large hadron collider . </S>",
    "<S> because the @xmath2 cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix is approximately real , the model also predicts a flat unitarity triangle and the absence of substantial cp violation in the @xmath3 system at future @xmath3 factories . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the general issues pertaining to the construction of such a workable model and how they lead to the successful strategy . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed renormalization group study is then used to establish the feasibility of the model considered . </S>"
