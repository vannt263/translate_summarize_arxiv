    "these controversies are generally related to the microscopic origin of isoscalar @xmath0pairing and whether the isoscalar @xmath0pair correlations lead to a pair condensate .",
    "the calculations with the realistic ( bare ) forces ( paris force , argonne v14 force ) indicate that the isoscalar pairing gap in the symmetric nuclear matter is 3 times larger than the isovector one @xcite . in finite nuclei with @xmath39 ,",
    "calculated isoscalar pairing gap is of the order of 3 mev @xcite , while the experimental isovector pairing gap is around 1.8 mev ( see fig .  4 in ref .",
    "however , despite that no convincing fingerprints of isoscalar @xmath2-pairing has been found so far ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the potential problem is due to the transition from realistic to effective interaction : the extremely strong @xmath26 @xmath0pairing emerges essentially from the fact that with respect to the @xmath24 channel , dominated by the central force , the tensor force is acting additionally .",
    "however , the medium modification ( screening ) of the tensor force is still controversial subject @xcite .",
    "for example , higher shell admixtures make the tensor force appear weaker in the valence space @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can not exclude the possibility that the tensor force is largely screened in the medium , and , thus , the enhancement of the t=0 gap values may be brought back closer to the values of the @xmath14 case @xcite .",
    "while the structure of interaction ( central force ) is the same in isovector pairing channel of the theories based on realistic and effective forces , the addition of tensor component into isoscalar pairing channel of the models based on effective forces may be necessary for a correct description of @xmath2-pairing in this channel . in the existing mean - field models , the tensor component of pairing",
    "is neglected .",
    "although , some attempts were made to approximate bare tensor interaction by effective density dependent zero - range @xmath40-force @xcite , the validity of such an approximation for different physical observables has not been tested in the mean field calculations .",
    "recent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) studies @xcite for finite nuclei with chiral n@xmath41lo two - nucleon interaction for pairing led to the results which are opposite to the ones discussed above .",
    "they showed that this type of nuclear forces favors isovector over isoscalar pairing , except in low-@xmath29 orbitals .",
    "the supression of isoscalar pairing has been traced to the effects of spin - orbit splitting , the @xmath42 waves and additional repulsive @xmath43 channel .",
