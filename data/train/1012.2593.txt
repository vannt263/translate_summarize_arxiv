    "moreover , since @xmath695 , @xmath696 , and the function @xmath697 is upper bounded , we obtain @xmath698 as @xmath699 .",
    "so we can replace @xmath149 by @xmath694 , thus assuming we have a sequence of pairs @xmath700 so that @xmath701 , @xmath702 is a pliss hyperbolic time for @xmath703 with exponent @xmath690 , @xmath704 , and @xmath705 as @xmath706 . in the sequel",

    "indeed , let @xmath709 be the largest integer such that @xmath710 .",
    "since we assume that @xmath149 is a pliss hyperbolic time for @xmath16 and since @xmath205 is close to a critical point , @xmath711 is small and hence the number @xmath712 must be large by  . in particular , @xmath713 .",
    "recall that @xmath12 contains periodic points together with their non - critical pre - images .",
    "let the forward trajectory of @xmath205 follow a periodic trajectory of a point @xmath714 . denote by @xmath715 the least period of @xmath633",
    ". then , by   we have @xmath716 which yields @xmath717 provided @xmath106 is small enough , where the factor 2 takes in account the distortion in a neighborhood of the trajectory of @xmath633 .",
    "so in the case that @xmath149 is a pliss hyperbolic time and @xmath718 we can consider the smallest integer @xmath719 for which @xmath720 . then there exists an integer @xmath721 between @xmath722 and @xmath723 which is a pliss hyperbolic time for @xmath16 with exponent @xmath724 .",

    "thus , we can conclude that none of the pullbacks @xmath737 captures a critical point and therefore @xmath751 is univalent on @xmath737 for every @xmath677 , @xmath252 , @xmath678 .    given @xmath343 , by lemma  [ lem : caf1 ]",
    "there exists @xmath168 and positive integers @xmath304 , @xmath217 , @xmath200 , and @xmath707 with @xmath169 and @xmath752 , @xmath172 , and a point @xmath753 such that @xmath754 is @xmath508-dense in @xmath21 and satisfies @xmath755 for every @xmath756 , @xmath252 , @xmath757 .",
    "now we can choose @xmath758 independent of @xmath16 so that for this point @xmath753 and every @xmath756 , @xmath252 , @xmath757 we have @xmath759 yielding that @xmath760 is univalent on @xmath761 defined by @xmath762 for every @xmath763 as well as @xmath764    thus , if @xmath149 is large enough so that @xmath765 then with @xmath766 and using with @xmath767 we obtain @xmath768 and hence for some choice of @xmath763 ( that will in general depend on @xmath769 ) we have @xmath770 and @xmath771 is univalent on @xmath772 .",
