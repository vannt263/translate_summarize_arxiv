    "<S> we examine the effect of short unstable periodic orbits on wavefunction statistics in a classically chaotic system , and find that the tail of the wavefunction intensity distribution in phase space is dominated by scarring associated with the least unstable periodic orbits . in an ensemble average over systems with classical orbits of different instabilities , a power law tail is found , in sharp contrast to the exponential prediction of random matrix theory . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are compared with numerical data and quantitative agreement is obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> 10000    0.2 in    quantum eigenstates of classically chaotic systems generically exhibit a phenomenon known as scarring , the enhancement of intensity along short unstable periodic orbits for some fraction of the wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> scarring is a fascinating example of the influence of identifiable classical structures on stationary quantum properties and on long - time quantum transport in a classically ergodic system . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of scars is in some sense paradoxical , because classically , all such short - time information is destroyed at long times , and a classical probability distribution after being evolved for a sufficiently long time retains no memory of its initial state . </S>",
    "<S> scarring is one of the most dramatic examples of a departure of quantum chaotic systems from the predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) , according to which wavefunctions must be evenly distributed over phase space , up to quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> scarring has now been observed experimentally in a variety of systems , including microwave cavities@xcite , tunnel junctions@xcite , and the hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> examples of scarring were observed numerically in @xcite , and a theory based on the semiclassical evolution of husimi states near a periodic orbit was provided . </S>",
    "<S> later work by bogomolny @xcite and berry @xcite involved calculations in coordinate space and wigner phase space , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> all these works were based on the linearized dynamics around the unstable periodic orbit , and were thus , by construction , theories of the short - time behavior only . yet to get a true understanding of the properties of individual eigenstates it is essential to understand the long - time quantum dynamics , including returns of amplitude to the original periodic orbit after undergoing excursions into other areas of phase space . in a recent paper @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a formalism was developed for dealing with these nonlinear contributions to scarring , providing quantitative agreement of the theory with numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> this work used a measure of scarring based on husimi intensities . </S>",
    "<S> ( recently fishman , agam , and others have provided interesting new perspectives on the problem on scarring , and have offered a measure of scarring related to , but somewhat different from ours @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a number of other authors have also made significant contributions in this area ; we can not list them all but a few recent references are provided in @xcite . ) in this paper , we will apply a result previously obtained in @xcite to compute the effect of scarring on the wavefunction intensity distribution , a function which has been investigated previously for diffusive systems@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we first give a general idea of the formalism and state the key result of @xcite which is relevant to the present work . </S>",
    "<S> a gaussian wavepacket @xmath0 is initially centered close to a classical periodic orbit and allowed to evolve . if the instability exponent @xmath1 of the orbit is small , the function @xmath2 will ( under the linearized dynamics ) exhibit recurrences on a time scale of one period @xmath3 , and the amplitude of these recurrences decays on a scale @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this decay leads to the formation of envelopes in the local density of states @xmath5 , which is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function . </S>",
    "<S> these envelopes in the energy spectrum have spacing @xmath6 , width scaling as @xmath7 for small @xmath1 , and height scaling as @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> long - time ( nonlinear ) recurrences lead to fluctuations multiplying this envelope in the energy domain . eventually , by the heisenberg time @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mean level spacing , individual peaks are resolved in the spectrum @xmath5 , the heights of the peaks being the intensities of the corresponding eigenstates at the test state @xmath0 , @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest picture of the non - linear recurrences assumes that the periods , actions , and homoclinic points corresponding to the long - time excursions are random and uncorrelated , up to the constraint of unitarity which produces delta - function spectral peaks by the heisenberg time . </S>",
    "<S> this , when combined with the known short - time dynamics in the linear regime , can be shown to produce a chi - squared distribution of spectral intensities multiplying the original linear envelope .    </S>",
    "<S> a key result of the calculations in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is the following : _ individual spectral lines ( overlap intensities ) in the local density of states obey the usual chi - squared ( porter - thomas ) fluctuations , but these are modulated by the fourier transform of the linearized short - time autocorrelation function . _ the latter can be computed analytically in terms of the instability @xmath1 of the classical orbit in question ( see eq .  [ alin ] below ) . more explicitly , in the case of complex eigenstates , the chi - squared distribution has two degrees of freedom , and in the absence of scarring the probability of having a spectral line height greater than @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 is normalized to have a mean value of unity , i.e. @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total number of states . now in the presence of scarring this is modified to @xmath16 for a eigenstate with energy @xmath17 . _ here @xmath18 is the spectral envelope given by the fourier transform of the linearized dynamics _ </S>",
    "<S> ( eq .  [ alin ] for the case treated in the present paper ) </S>",
    "<S> .    in the following discussion we will for simplicity consider the case of scarring by a fixed point of a discrete - time map . </S>",
    "<S> ( the generalization of the results to orbits of period greater than one and to continuous time systems is straightforward@xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> so let us consider without loss of generality a hyperbolic fixed point at the origin of a compact phase space , with exponent @xmath1 , and stable and unstable manifolds oriented along the @xmath19 and @xmath20 axes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion near the fixed point are then given by @xmath21 in the presence of shearing , e.g. @xmath22 , or for non - orthogonal stable and unstable manifolds , or in the case where the manifolds are not oriented along the @xmath19 and @xmath20 axes , a canonical transformation would first need to be performed to get the equations of motion into the form above . </S>",
    "<S> now we define our test state to be a gaussian wavepacket centered at @xmath23 , with horizontal width @xmath24 and vertical width @xmath25 . in coordinate representation </S>",
    "<S> this is given by @xmath26 } \\,.\\ ] ] in situations described above where the local equations of motion do not have the form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqmo ] in the natural coordinates , an optimal test state would have a complex width @xmath24 in those coordinates , as can be seen by performing a canonical transformation of the gaussian of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ psiform ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we now allow the wavepacket to evolve under the linearized dynamics , stretching each time step by a factor @xmath27 in the @xmath28direction and shrinking by the same factor in the @xmath29direction . </S>",
    "<S> the linearized quantum autocorrelation function after time @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the phase associated with one iteration of the periodic orbit , given by the classical action in units of @xmath33 , plus any maslov indices associated with caustics in the classical dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 determines the location of the peak in the spectral envelope @xmath34 , defined to be the fourier transform of @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> since we will be interested in performing an energy average , we freely set @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> now the expression in eq .  [ alin ] can be inserted into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pscar ] to obtain the distribution of wavefunction intensities at a given energy . </S>",
    "<S> because we wish here to consider all eigenstates , independent of energy , we then perform an energy averaging , remembering that for a map the quasi - energy is defined to lie between @xmath37 and @xmath38 only . </S>",
    "<S> we also notice that the tail of the intensity distribution will be dominated by the peak of the spectral envelope at @xmath39 , and we therefore can use a saddle point approximation , obtaining @xmath40 where the expression obtained is an asymptotic form valid for large @xmath12 . for small @xmath1 , the sum over time steps can be replaced by an integral , and we have at @xmath41 @xmath42 now by dimensional analysis , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are numerical constants . </S>",
    "<S> we thus obtain the first result of this paper , the tail of the intensity distribution for a wavepacket centered on a periodic orbit , @xmath47 notice that the exponential tail has been effectively stretched by a factor of @xmath48 , corresponding to the increased height of the peak of the linear envelope at small @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a linear suppression factor of @xmath1 , corresponding to the width of the peak in @xmath34 , and indicating that only a fraction scaling as @xmath1 of all the eigenstates are effectively scarred . </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of the eigenstates are typically  antiscarred \" , having on average a lower intensity at the periodic orbit than would be expected based on rmt . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution will have a nontrivial inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , scaling as the inverse of the width of the linear envelope , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ as @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> the region of validity of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res1 ] is @xmath50 the first inequality ensures that many iterations of the periodic orbit contribute ( so the sum over iterations can be replaced by an integral ) and the scarring is strong . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , however , because of the large value of the numerical constant @xmath45 , the formula works well even for exponents as small as @xmath51 , as will be seen in the numerical study below . </S>",
    "<S> the second inequality says that we are in the tail of the distribution and the events are all coming from the peak of the linear envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the third inequality is a unitarity constraint  </S>",
    "<S> obviously our assumption of random fluctuations breaks down for intensities of order unity , when the entire wavefunction would be concentrated in a phase space area of order @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we go on to perform a similar analysis integrating over the phase space variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 . as </S>",
    "<S> before , we take the exponential @xmath54 and expand to second order in @xmath55 around the maximum @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> . then upon integration by stationary phase we pick up a determinant factor of @xmath56 here we have taken the classical phase space volume to be unity for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> now for small @xmath1 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is yet another numerical constant , and similarly for @xmath53 , with @xmath24 replaced by @xmath59=@xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> so the total factor resulting from the phase space integration is @xmath61 , again independent of @xmath24 . combining this with the expression in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res1 ] above , we obtain the second result , for the distribution of overlap intensities after energy and phase space averaging , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath62 here we have picked up a factor of @xmath33 from the factor of @xmath24 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pswidth ] and the corresponding factor of @xmath25 associated with the falloff in @xmath18 in the momentum direction . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the tail is coming entirely from the region near the periodic orbit , specifically from wavepackets that have large classical probability density right on the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> ( thus , a measure like the ipr for a generically placed wavepacket will not see the effect of scarring by an individual periodic orbit , when the semiclassical limit has been taken . ) the result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res2 ] is valid in the regime @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the value of @xmath12 near which the rmt exponential decay law reaches values of order @xmath65 . in this region , a crossover occurs between the head of the distribution , which is dominated by non - scarred region of phase space and approaches the porter - thomas ( rmt ) prediction , and the tail , dominated by scarring , given by the expression above . </S>",
    "<S> the expression eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res2 ] holds also for an ensemble of systems , all having an orbit with instability @xmath1 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , we should of course do a sum over all periodic orbits , however the tail will clearly always be dominated by the orbit with smallest @xmath1 .    finally , we now consider an ensemble of systems where the value of the smallest exponent varies from system to system , with distribution @xmath66 for small @xmath1 . then using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res2 ] and integrating over @xmath1 we obtain @xmath67 note that this is an uncontrolled approximation because we have integrated over @xmath1 after having assumed @xmath68 was large . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we had included higher - order corrections in @xmath69 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res2 ] , the scaling of @xmath70 would remain unchanged , i.e. @xmath71 with the dimensionless function @xmath72 somewhat different from that given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> an important point is that the tail displays power - law behavior in the intensity @xmath12 , a strong deviation from the exponential prediction of rmt . as with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res2 ] , this asymptotic form is valid for values of @xmath12 large compared to @xmath64 and small compared to @xmath15 . for small @xmath12 we again expect a crossover to the porter - thomas form . for large @xmath12 we expect a downward correction away from the @xmath73 form , with a breakdown of the approximation occurring at some fraction of @xmath15 , depending on @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we proceed to test numerically these predictions of the nonlinear scarring theory . </S>",
    "<S> the system we use for this purpose is the generalized three - strip baker s map , described in some detail in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this system is similar to the original baker s map , except that the two strips are replaced by three , with widths generally unequal , but normalized to @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a fixed point of the classical dynamics associated with the middle strip , and the instability associated with this orbit is given by @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> so we choose @xmath77 , set @xmath78 , and find numerically the wavefunction intensity distribution at the fixed point after ensemble averaging over the widths @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the predictions are expected to hold for individual systems as well , at sufficiently large values of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the matrices which we can efficiently diagonalize , @xmath15 is not large enough to obtain good statistics in the tail without ensemble averaging . ) </S>",
    "<S> a circular wavepacket of width @xmath80 is used . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( upper thick curve ) with the prediction of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res1 ] , plotted as a dashed curve . </S>",
    "<S> the rmt prediction is shown as a dotted line . </S>",
    "<S> note that the theoretical prediction of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res1 ] has no free parameters and is @xmath33-independent , depending only on the exponent @xmath1 of the periodic orbit in question .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we perform a phase space average for the systems described above , collecting statistics for wavepackets uniformly distributed over the entire phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting statistics are also plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( lower thick curve ) , where the theoretical prediction for the tail , given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res2 ] , is shown as a solid curve . </S>",
    "<S> again , the porter - thomas distribution appears as a dotted line . </S>",
    "<S> we see a crossover between the two regimes at a value of @xmath12 of order @xmath64 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we want to construct an ensemble which will contain systems with orbits of different instability exponents @xmath1 . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we take a uniform distribution of strip widths @xmath81 and @xmath82 , each in the range @xmath83 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the fixed point in the middle strip , with exponent @xmath84 , is always the least unstable periodic orbit . </S>",
    "<S> this ensemble has power @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the notation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> averaging over @xmath87 systems , we obtain the statistics plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . the power - law prediction given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res3 ] is plotted as a solid line on the log - log scale , with the rmt prediction as a dotted curve . </S>",
    "<S> once again , we see a crossover between the two regimes for @xmath12 of order @xmath88 . we also see a gradual breakdown of the approximation as @xmath12 approaches values comparable to @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the quantitative agreement is in spite of the fact that an uncontrolled stationary phase approximation was used in obtaining the overall constant in front of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res3 ] , as explained above . </S>",
    "<S> the important thing to notice here is the power - law behavior of the tail , in agreement with the theory , and the dramatic deviation from the predictions of rmt . </S>",
    "<S> by @xmath89 , where the approximation @xmath90 is clearly beginning to break down , the measured probability is still within a factor of @xmath91 of our prediction and is enhanced by @xmath92 over the porter - thomas value .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also checked the linear @xmath33-dependance of the phase - space averaged results eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ res2],[res3 ] by repeating the preceding numerical analysis with larger matrices ( @xmath93 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have constructed an @xmath94 ensemble by imposing the restriction @xmath95 and have observed a @xmath96 power - law behavior in accordance with eq .  </S>",
