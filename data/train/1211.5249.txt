    "in recent years higher dimensional gravity is investigated in various contexts such as string and brane - world models , and the gauge - gravity correspondence conjecture .",
    "black holes solutions are of particular interest encoding information about the fundamental properties of the gravitational theory , and eventually making possible its experimental verification",
    ". typical feature of higher dimensional gravity is that it allows greater abundance of black hole solutions than in four dimensions with qualitatively different properties @xcite .",
    "ones of the most physically justified are kaluza - klein solutions , in which the extra dimension is compactified to a circle with a radius too small to be generally observed .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate in further details the black hole solutions in the five dimensional ( 5d ) einstein - maxwell - dilation gravity with kaluza - klein asymptotic .",
    "we construct a new exact solution which represents a static black hole situated into external magnetic field , i.e. magnetized black hole .",
    "the solution is only locally asymptotically kaluza - klein @xmath0 , but globally its spacelike cross - sections at infinity represent a hopf - fibration .",
    "such geometry is characteristic for the euclidean taub - nut instanton , and in fact our solution reduces to a taub - nut instanton trivially embedded in 5d lorentzian spacetime in the limit when the event horizon vanishes .",
    "for that reason the solution is also called a black hole on the taub - nut instanton being a part of a larger class of 5d black hole solutions on gravitational instantons @xcite .",
    "we obtain the physical characteristics of the solution and derive the smarr - like relations . the calculations are closely related to our recent results on the thermodynamics of 5d black holes on asymptotically locally flat gravitational instantons @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition , we investigate the hawking radiation of the solution by obtaining the greybody factor and the luminosity for emission of massless scalar particles in the low - energy regime .",
    "similar calculations are already performed for 5d vacuum squashed black holes @xcite , @xcite , and they reveal that the emission spectrum deviates qualitatively from the case of a four - dimensional black hole .",
    "thus , the hawking radiation of such black holes could be possibly used for experimental detection of extra dimensions .",
    "we further show that , in distinction to the magnetized black holes with flat asymptotic , the external magnetic field influences the thermodynamical characteristics and the hawking radiation of the solution , and consequently can be used to tune the black hole parameters .",
    "we consider the einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity ( emd ) in five - dimensional spacetime with the action    @xmath1    which leads to the field equations @xmath2 , \\\\",

    "we are interested in solutions admitting three commuting killing vectors , one asymptotically timelike killing vector @xmath8 , and two spacelike killing vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 , or more precisely , solutions with a group of symmetry @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , we require that the dilaton coupling parameter takes the particular value @xmath12 . under these conditions",
    "we obtain the following exact solution    @xmath13   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & v^{-1/3 } \\frac{r}{r+ r_{0}}\\left(d\\psi + r_\\infty\\cos\\theta d\\phi\\right)^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the metric function @xmath14 is given by @xmath15    the maxwell 2-form is expressed as @xmath16 with magnetic potentials @xmath17    the coordinates vary in the limits @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a periodic coordinate with period @xmath21 .",
    "the real parameter @xmath22 characterizes the electromagnetic field , @xmath23 is a scale parameter and @xmath24 denotes the position of a black hole horizon . the parameter @xmath25 is expressed as @xmath26 .",
    "the solution contains coordinate singularity ( the so called misner string ) at @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) , resulting from the fact that no global chart exists for the solution manifold .",
    "an atlas can be defined , consisting of several charts , if the coordinate @xmath29 is identified with a period @xmath30 , which ensures that the transition between the charts is well - defined .",
    "consequently , the spatial cross - sections at @xmath31 are diffeomorphic to a hopf fibration of @xmath32 , and the solution is described as locally asymptotically flat according to the classification of @xcite .",
    "the solution we obtained is a generalization of the vacuum squashed black hole @xcite , which is reproduced in the limit @xmath33 .",
    "it also contains a new magnetized version of the gross - perry - sorkin monopole @xcite,@xcite",

    "as already discussed , the spacial cross - sections of the solution at @xmath31 represent a nontrivial @xmath40-fibration over @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , the solution is characterized by a nut charge , which is proportional to the first chern class of the fibre bundle .",
    "the nut charge can be calculated by the following komar - like integral @xcite    @xmath50    where @xmath10 is the killing 1-form associated with the @xmath40 fibre at infinity , @xmath51 is its norm and @xmath52 is a two - dimensional surface , encompassing the nut . in our case",
    "this is equivalent to the relation    @xmath53    which was derived in @xcite for black holes on asymptotically locally flat gravitational instantons .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in addition to the nut charge the solution is characterized by a related quantity , called a nut potential .",

    "the physical characteristics of the solution , which we discussed in the previous section are connected by a set of geometrical relations , called smarr - like relations for the mass and the tension .",
    "they can be derived by considering the komar integrals ( [ mt ] ) , reducing them to the factor space of the spacetime with respect to the isometry group @xmath64 , and performing a series of transformations by using the spacetime symmetries and the field equations .",
    "the major part of the calculation coincides with the investigation of a related solution in @xcite , so we will mention here only the basic steps referring the reader to the corresponding article for further details .",
    "the so - called interval structure associated with the solution @xcite , which determines the boundary of the factor space @xmath64 is of basic importance for the calculation . in our case",

    "it is well known that in a semi - classical approximation black holes emit particles as a black body with temperature proportional to the surface gravity of the horizon @xcite .",
    "the emission is characterized by an exact thermal spectrum only at the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "if observed at infinity , it is modified by a factor , called greybody factor , due to the interaction of the radiation with the non - trivial geometry of the curved spacetime acting as an effective potential barrier .",
    "the greybody factor reflects the probability of an out - going wave with a certain frequency to reach infinity , and it is equivalent to the absorption probability for the same frequency mode , i.e. the probability for an in - coming wave to be absorbed by the black hole",
    ".    there exists a simple procedure for calculating the absorption probability in cases when the differential equation describing the propagation of a field in a particular spacetime is separable .",
    "then it can be reduced to a schrdinger - type equation for some radial coordinate with an effective potential encoding the properties of the propagating field and the spacetime geometry , and the problem reduces to the quantum mechanical problem of wave scattering by a potential barrier .",
    "although the schrdinger - type equation can not be solved exactly in most of the cases , an approximation scheme can be applied in the low - energy limit , when the wave length of the emitted particles is larger than the characteristic scale of the black hole horizon .",
    "classical examples of such calculations are @xcite-@xcite .    in this section",
    "we will calculate the absorption probability of the magnetized black hole solution we presented in section 2 for massless scalar fields .",
    "we consider the corresponding field equation in the spacetime described by ( @xmath92 )    @xmath93    the equation is separable and possesses the following type of solutions @xmath94 with radial and angular functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 satisfying a set of differential equations @xmath97 where we have introduced the functions @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 for convenience . the angular equation is solved in the so called spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath101 with parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the radial equation can be transformed into a schrdinger - like equation @xmath104 by making the coordinate transformation @xmath105 and introducing a new radial function @xmath106 such as @xmath107 .",
    "the potential @xmath108 is given in terms of the initial radial coordinate by the following expression    @xmath109    ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( -25,102 ) ( 120,-10)r    we consider the scattering of an incident wave at infinity by the effective potential ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "taking into account the properties of the spacetime , we require that no outgoing wave should be present at @xmath111 , as a black hole horizon is located there .",
    "thus , the physically relevant solutions should obey the boundary conditions    @xmath112    where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the transmission and reflection coefficients , respectively . by definition the absorption probability",
    "@xmath115 is proportional to the transmission coefficient , i.e. @xmath116 .    the schrdinger - like equation can not be solved exactly , for that reason we will find the absorption probability only for low energies of the scalar field , when an approximation scheme can be applied .",
    "the low energy regime implies frequencies that satisfy @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the horizon radius , and @xmath119 is the black hole temperature .",
    "then we can define several regions in spacetime , solve in each of them an approximate form of the scrdinger - like equation which is valid in the particular region , and match the obtained solutions at the common region boundaries .",
    "the local solutions can be matched with a high accuracy because in the low energy limit the wave - length of the scalar field is much larger than any of the characteristic scales associated with the black hole .",
    "usually the following three regions are defined : a near horizon region , where @xmath120 , and the frequency is much larger that the effective potential , @xmath121 , an intermediate region , where the effective potential is much larger than the frequency , @xmath122 , and asymptotic region , where @xmath123 .",
    "it is reasonable also to assume that @xmath124 as the leading contribution to the absorption probability in the low energy limit comes from this mode .    applying the approximation scheme we briefly described , we obtain that the radial equation ( @xmath125 ) reduces to the following form @xmath126 in the near horizon region .",
    "it can be solved by using the transformation @xmath127 , thus obtaining a solution    @xmath128    where we have taken into account the boundary condition that only ingoing waves should be present at the horizon .    in the limit @xmath129 , which corresponds to the boundary of the near - horizon region with the intermediate region ,",
    "this solution becomes    @xmath130.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next we consider the intermediate region with a characteristic scale @xmath131 .",
    "we can neglect the frequency compared to the effective potential there and obtain the approximate equation @xmath132 which is solved by    @xmath133    the solution has the following limit at @xmath134 , corresponding to the boundary with the near - horizon region    @xmath135    which should be equivalent with the near - horizon solution ( @xmath136 ) , and another limit at @xmath137 @xmath138 corresponding to the boundary with the asymptotic region .",
    "finally , in the asymptotic region @xmath139 the following approximate equation applies @xmath140 it can be solved analytically as @xmath141 and the solution tends to    @xmath142    in the limit @xmath143 .",
    "this limit overlaps with the intermediate region , since @xmath144 is satisfied for its characteristic scale @xmath145 when low energies are considered . consequently , the expression ( @xmath146 ) should be equivalent to the intermediate region solution ( @xmath147 ) .    as a result of the described calculation",
    "the following matching conditions should be imposed on the integration constants of the local solutions in the three regions    @xmath148    reflecting the equivalence of solutions ( @xmath136 ) and ( @xmath149 ) , as well as ( @xmath147 ) and ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "the solution in the asymptotic region can also be presented in the form @xmath150 hence , the reflection coefficient is given by @xmath151 , where the constants @xmath152 can be expressed by means of the frequency and the spacetime parameters by considering the matching conditions ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "consequently , we obtain the absorption probability    @xmath154    where @xmath44 is the horizon area ( @xmath155 ) and @xmath156 is the length of the compact dimension . the luminosity of the emission of a particular kind of uncharged particles with absorption probability @xmath157 is determined by the expression    @xmath158    where @xmath159 is the black hole temperature .",
    "taking advantage of eq .",
