    "conformal transformations play an interesting role in physics and mathematics@xcite . conventionally , there are two meanings of the term `` conformal transformation '' in the literature .",
    "one is what we call the conformal coordinate transformation , which is a special kind of coordinate transformations and whose infinitesimal generators are the conformal killing vectors ( ckvs ) .",
    "the other is the local rescaling ( more commonly called the weyl transformation ) , which acts directly on the metric and can be regarded as a kind of gauge transformation .",
    "these two meanings certainly have some relationship , but it is more appropriate to clearly distinguish them.unless otherwise specified , we mean in this paper by the term `` conformal transformation '' as the conformal coordinate transformation__. _",
    "_    it has been shown that maxwell s equations are invariant under the larger conformal group @xcite .",
    "codirla and osborn pointed out that one can easily obtain the electromagnetic field associated with uniformly accelerated charged particles by the conformal invariance of the maxwell equations with point - like charges @xcite . and conformal transformations in 2-dimension also play an important role in string theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , as what we will introduce in the next section , conformal transformations can not be globally defined on the minkowski spacetime , which means that the conformal invariance of electrodynamics can only be regarded as local .",
    "in fact , conformal transformations can always globally act compactification spacetime ( @xmath0 ) , this idea inspires us to compactify the minkowski , even ds / ads , spacetime . , electrodynamics even can not be well defined globally on the ordinary conformal compactification of the minkowski spacetime .",
    "instead , electrodynamics globally defined on the double covering of that conformal compactification is possible , which has long been noticed as mentioned in ref . @xcite .",
    "we call this double covering the doubled conformal compactification.interestingly , penrose had shown the doubled penrose diagrams in @xcite , which is closely related to the doubled conformal compactification here . in this paper",
    ", we try to construct the doubled conformal conpactification to make the electrodynamics globally defined .    considering that the zero - radius pseudo - sphere in ( 4 + 2)-dimensional minkowski space can always simplify the problem and give an obvious map about conformal compactification ( see for example @xcite )",
    ", we briefly give a review of conformal compactification in the viewpoint of the projective cone in section 2 .",
    "we show the breakdown of the maxwell equations on the compactification of minkowski ds / ads spacetime in section 3 and give penrose diagrams to describe the problem in details , in which one can find out the double covering solution , in section 4 .",
    "the conformal transformations form a group , named the conformal group , under certain conditions .",
    "it is well known that the conformal group on the @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 is of @xmath3 dimensions for @xmath0 and of infinite dimensions for @xmath4 .",
    "but general conformal transformations can not be globally defined on such a flat space , so this well - known result has only considered the local aspects of conformal transformations .",
    "in fact , nontrivial conformal transformations can be globally defined on the @xmath1-sphere @xmath5 instead , where the conformal group is of @xmath3 dimensions whether @xmath0 or @xmath4 .",
    "there exists a conformal mapping between @xmath2 and @xmath5 , which smoothly extends the conventional conformal transformations on the former to the globally defined ones on the latter . for @xmath4 only a @xmath6 dimensional subgroup of the infinite - dimensional `` conformal group '' on @xmath7 can be so extended , which can be regarded as the `` global '' conformal group on @xmath7 .",
    "case can also be identified as the `` angle - preserving '' one and the `` circle - preserving '' one , respectively .",
    "for another elucidation of this problem , see ref .",
    "@xcite , chapter 5 . ]",
    "there is exactly one point on @xmath5 that has no image on @xmath2 under the conformal mapping .",
    "that point , though actually not on @xmath2 , is called the infinity point ( also known as the conformal boundary for the case that the space has a non - positive - definite signature ) of @xmath2 . the procedure that adds the infinity point to @xmath2 , so that the conformal transformations can be globally defined , is known as the conformal compactification of @xmath2 . the resulting compactified space",
    "( @xmath5 here ) is also called the conformal compactification ( of @xmath2 ) . @xmath2 and @xmath5 are both constant curvature ( or maximal symmetry ) spaces . in differential geometry",
    "it is known that only constant curvature spaces have @xmath3 independent ckvs ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "in fact , all the constant curvature spaces , with any metric signatures , have @xmath3-dimensional `` global '' conformal groups and the corresponding conformal compactifications for @xmath8 .",
    "is its own conformal compactification . ]    to see how the doubly conformal compactification arises , let us first have a simple review of the ordinary conformal compactification of the minkowski spacetime",
    ". as constant curvature spaces with the same signature , de sitter ( ds ) and anti - de sitter ( ads ) space times also have that conformal compactification , which can be all treated from the viewpoint of the projective cone . from now on , we concentrate on the 4-dimensional case .",
    "the projective cone @xmath9 $ ] is defined as a zero - radius pseudo - sphere @xmath10 in a ( @xmath11)-dimensional minkowski space : @xmath12 modulo the projective equivalence relation$ ] to be a ( 4-dimensional ) manifold , the origin @xmath13 must be excluded . ]",
    "@xmath14 the equivalence class corresponding to the point @xmath15 is denoted by @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the whole ( @xmath11)-dimensional minkowski space @xmath17 modulo the projective equivalence relation ( [ projective ] ) is the 5-dimensional projective space @xmath18 , so @xmath9 $ ] is a submanifold of @xmath18 .",
    "it is obvious that the pseudo - sphere ( [ zero - sphere ] ) and the equivalence relation ( [ projective ] ) are both invariant under general @xmath19 transformations , among which a @xmath20 antipodal reflection @xmath21 acts trivially on @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "then it can be shown that @xmath9 $ ] is the conformal compactification of all the minkowski , ds and ads space times , where the @xmath22 transformations act as conformal transformations on these space times .",
    "these different space times can be regarded as different choices of representatives in the equivalence classes on @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , these constant curvature space times correspond to choose representative points by intersecting @xmath10 with hyperplanes in @xmath17 , where the metrics on them are naturally induced from @xmath23 . for the hyperplane @xmath24 : @xmath25 with @xmath26 the normal vector , it can be shown that the intersection manifold is characterized by @xmath27 as follows :    * @xmath28 : ds spacetime , * @xmath29 : minkowski spacetime , * @xmath30 : ads spacetime ,    where in any case @xmath31 is just the scalar curvature of the intersection manifold .    more concretely , to get the minkowski spacetime we just choose a light - like normal vector @xmath32 thus the intersection @xmath33 of @xmath10 and the corresponding @xmath24 is flat with respect to the metric induced from @xmath23 , and can be parametrized by @xmath34 with @xmath35 an arbitrary length scale parameter and @xmath36 the lightcone coordinates .",
    "the induced metric is proportional to vect @xmath37 so @xmath38 is just the cartesian coordinates on @xmath33 .",
    "then it is straightforward to show that the @xmath22 transformations act as conformal transformations on @xmath33 ( ) .",
    "note that some equivalence classes on @xmath10 , which correspond to the infinity points of @xmath33 , have no representatives on @xmath24 .",
    "they constitute precisely the intersection of @xmath10 and the hyperplane @xmath39 which is parallel to @xmath24 . adding those infinity points to @xmath33 produces its conformal compactification @xmath9 $ ] , whose @xmath22 action is fully well - defined .",
    "the ds and ads space times can be obtained by choosing typically @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "however , they also have infinity points , or conformal boundary , to be included for a fully well - defined @xmath22 conformal action , since no single hyperplane can contain representatives of all the equivalence classes on @xmath10 .",
    "to remedy this problem , one may use general hypersurfaces ( of antipodal symmetry ) to intersect @xmath10 .",
    "it can be shown that these intersection manifolds are all conformally flat , and that the @xmath22 transformations induce conformal transformations on them .",
    "the simplest choice of this hypersurface is a 5-sphere @xmath42 which intersects all the equivalence classes on @xmath10 precisely twice .",
    "the intersection of @xmath10 and the 5-sphere ( [ 5-sphere ] ) is an @xmath43 : @xmath44 upon the antipodal identification ( [ antipodal ] ) , one sees that @xmath9 $ ] is of topology @xmath45 which is actually homeomorphic to @xmath43 .",
    "although there is no natural metric defined on @xmath9 $ ] , there is an induced metric on the intersection manifold ( [ intersection ] ) ( modulo the antipodal identification ) , which is called @xmath46 hereafter .",
    "@xmath46 is conformally flat and has a globally defined @xmath22 conformal group , so it can be regarded as a metrical realization of @xmath9 $ ] , being the conformal compactification of all the minkowski , ds and ads space times .",
    "the above construction of conformal compactification can be extended to any dimension and any metric signature . however , for even @xmath1 it can be shown that @xmath47 is not homeomorphic to @xmath48 but is a non - orientable manifold , so the conformal compactification of ( @xmath49)-dimensional spacetime is not simple and in some sense not suitable to be a spacetime .",
    "one immediately sees that this shortcoming can be simply overcome by discarding the @xmath20 antipodal identification .",
    "that is the doubly conformal compactification , which can be realized by replacing the projective equivalence relation ( [ projective ] ) with the pseudo - projective one : @xmath50 for the @xmath51 case , we use @xmath9_{+}$ ] to denote @xmath52 modulo the above equivalence relation , i.e. , the doubly conformal compactification of all the minkowski , ds and ads space times , whose metrical realization is exactly the intersection manifold ( [ intersection ] ) , denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "correspondingly , the conformal group on ( [ intersection ] ) is @xmath19 instead of @xmath22 .",
    "we have shown the geometrical process of compactification . it is the most important that physical considerations support the introduction of the doubly conformal compactification . at this section",
    "we will introduce the discontinuity of electrodynamics caused by compactifing the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the action functional of electrodynamics in general space times is @xmath54 in this paper the metrics always have a @xmath55 signature . for the minkowski spacetime with cartesian coordinates ( @xmath56 ) , the above action functional is invariant ( up to a boundary term ) under the conformal transformations provided that @xmath57 and @xmath58 transform as @xmath59 respectively , where the transformation of @xmath57 is just trivial and that of @xmath58 contains a conformal factor @xmath60 defined by @xmath61    in fact , the action functional ( [ action ] ) in general space times is invariant under , in addition to the diffeomorphism , the weyl transformation @xmath62 provided that @xmath57 ( and thus @xmath63 ) is invariant and @xmath58 transforms as @xmath64 since the ds , ads and @xmath46 space times can all be obtained by weyl transformations from the minkowski spacetime , where the cartesian coordinates @xmath38 become the conformally flat coordinates on these space times , we can easily map the electrodynamics from the minkowski spacetime to them .",
    "the conformally flat coordinates on the ds spacetime can be obtained by the stereographic projection @xcite , with the weyl factor @xmath65 with @xmath66 the ds radius .",
    "the ads case is simply achieved by replacing @xmath67 with @xmath68 for most of the ds expressions , so we only mention the ds case .",
    "the weyl factor for certain conformally flat coordinates on @xmath46 can be shown to be @xmath69 which is positive definite reflecting the fact that @xmath46 has no conformal boundary .",
    "the action functional ( [ action ] ) with @xmath56 @xmath70 leads to the familiar equation of motion @xmath71 the simplest solution to the above equation is the coulomb field for a static point charge : @xmath72 general solutions to equation ( [ eom ] ) are just linear combinations of this fundamental solution .",
    "of special interest is the electromagnetic field associated with uniformly accelerated point charge , which can be obtained from the solution ( [ fundamental ] ) by conformal transformations @xcite .",
    "there one sees that , however , an additional sign factor @xmath73 has to be inserted ( or equivalently , discarded ) to attain a globally defined solution .",
    "that , in fact , already indicates the doubly conformal compactification . in the following , we will use weyl transformations to map the solution ( [ fundamental ] ) onto the ds and @xmath46 space times , where the doubly conformal compactification is shown to be necessary . for simplicity , we take @xmath74 in equation ( [ ds_factor ] ) and massless @xmath75 in equation ( [ n_factor ] ) .",
    "first we consider the ds case . in this case",
    "we have from equations ( [ j_weyl ] ) and ( [ ds_factor ] ) @xmath76 while @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the same as @xmath79 and @xmath80 in equation ( [ fundamental ] ) , respectively .",
    "note that there are actually two antipodal point charges here , due to the conformal boundary @xmath81 separating the world line @xmath82 into two parts . properly speaking",
    ", the line @xmath82 is separated into three segments , but the outer two of them are joined through the minkowski conformal infinity , as shown in figure [ penrose - cfds ] , where the dash line kn can be regarded as the world line of the charges in ds spacetime . for convenience , we omit the prime in these notations in the following equations . since one patch of conformally flat coordinates can not cover the whole ds spacetime , other coordinate patches must also be used to check whether the above solution is globally defined on the ds spacetime .",
    "it is easy to see that one more ( conformally - flat - coordinate ) patch is sufficient , which can be viewed as the inversion @xmath83 of the original conformally flat coordinates .",
    "( one can define special conformal transformations by combining an inversion with a translation and then another inversion @xcite . ) under the coordinate transformation ( [ inversion ] ) , we have @xmath84j_{\\nu}(x),\\quad\\tilde{x}_{\\mu}=\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\tilde{x}^{\\nu},\\ ] ] which means @xmath85^{2}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\tilde{x}^{2}}+\\frac{2\\tilde{t}^{2}}{(\\tilde{x}^{2})^{2}}\\right]\\delta^{3}\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\vect x}}{\\tilde{x}^{2}}\\right)\\nonumber \\\\   & = & e(1-\\tilde{t}^{2})^{2}\\delta^{3}(\\tilde{\\vect x})\\label{ds_inverse_j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 , and @xmath87 at the same time , the electromagnetic field transforms as @xmath88\\left[\\frac{\\delta_{\\nu}^{\\sigma}}{\\tilde{x}^{2}}-2\\frac{\\tilde{x}^{\\sigma}\\tilde{x}_{\\nu}}{(\\tilde{x}^{2})^{2}}\\right]f_{\\rho\\sigma}=\\frac{f_{\\mu\\nu}}{(\\tilde{x}^{2})^{2}}-2\\frac{\\tilde{x}^{\\rho}\\tilde{x}_{\\mu}}{(\\tilde{x}^{2})^{3}}f_{\\rho\\nu}-2\\frac{\\tilde{x}^{\\sigma}\\tilde{x}_{\\nu}}{(\\tilde{x}^{2})^{3}}f_{\\mu\\sigma},\\label{}\\ ] ] which means @xmath89\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{e}{4\\pi}(\\tilde{x}^{2})^{-3}\\left[(\\tilde{t}^{2}+\\tilde{\\vect x}^{2})\\frac{\\tilde{x}^{i}/\\tilde{x}^{2}}{|\\tilde{\\vect x}/\\tilde{x}^{2}|^{3}}-2\\tilde{x}^{i}\\frac{\\tilde{\\vect x}^{2}/\\tilde{x}^{2}}{|\\tilde{\\vect x}/\\tilde{x}^{2}|^{3}}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   & = & -\\epsilon(\\tilde{x}^{2})\\frac{e}{4\\pi}\\frac{\\tilde{x}^{i}}{\\tilde{\\vect x}^{2}}\\label{tilde_e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath90 the sign of @xmath91 and @xmath92    the discontinuity of @xmath93 from the @xmath90 factor in equation ( [ tilde_e ] ) indicates the breakdown of the maxwell equation at @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , one may roughly understand this breakdown by the usual argument that there can be no net charge on compact spaces , since the ds spacetime can be viewed as an expanding @xmath95 and it can be shown from equations ( [ ds_j ] ) and ( [ ds_inverse_j ] ) that there are two charges of the same signature on any one of the @xmath95 simultaneity hypersurfaces .    also",
    ", it s interesting to consider about maxwell equation with the magnetic and electric charges .",
    "the solution ( [ fundamental ] ) is changed to be :    @xmath96    where the @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the magnetic charge and current . with the second equation",
    ", one can easily see that the field    @xmath99    so the transformation of the field seems different with([tilde_e ] ) and ( [ tilde_b ] ) .",
    "in fact , after adding the magnetic charge , there will be a none zero term in @xmath100 , which means that the magnetic charges will contribute to the electric field in the conformal transformation .",
    "but the discontinuity of the @xmath100 at @xmath82 still exists since the discontinuity is this indicates the discontinuity of the magnetic field at @xmath94 .",
    "one can roughly understand this by thinking about the symmetry of electric and the magnetic charges .",
    "the above discussion can be illustrated with penrose diagrams , as in figure [ penrose ] .",
    "the lightcone @xmath94 corresponds to the dashed line segments @xmath101 and @xmath102 in figure [ penrose - invds ] .",
    "then it is easy to see that the discontinuity of @xmath93 at @xmath94 can be removed by reversing the sign of the electromagnetic field and electric current : @xmath103 in the regions `` i '' to `` iv '' , so that the maxwell equation @xmath104 can be satisfied on the whole ds spacetime .",
    "we explicitly write this global solution as @xmath105 for this solution the two antipodal point charges on the ds spacetime have opposite signs .",
    "the penrose diagram of ds spacetime as figure [ penrose - cfds ] is not the familiar one , but has the shape of that of the minkowski spacetime .",
    "it turns out to be interesting that we superpose the familiar penrose diagrams of ds and minkowski space times , as in figure [ penrose - mds ] . there",
    "the cylinder @xmath106 ( with identification @xmath107=@xmath108 ) is the penrose diagram of ds spacetime , while the diamond @xmath109 is that of minkowski spacetime .",
    "if we identify the regions `` i '' to `` iv '' with `` i@xmath110 '' to `` iv@xmath110 '' , respectively , we obtain the ordinary conformal compactification of ds and minkowski space times ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have seen that for globally defined solutions on ds and minkowski space times ( [ fundamental ] ) and ( [ global ] ) the electromagnetic field and electric current in the regions `` i '' to `` iv '' differ from that in `` i@xmath110 '' to `` iv@xmath110 '' by a sign , up to positive weyl factors . in order to find a conformal compactification of the minkowski and ds / ads space times where the electrodynamics can be globally defined , then , instead of identifying the regions `` i '' to `` iv '' with `` i@xmath110 '' to `` iv@xmath110 '' immediately , one should take them as , actually , antipodal regions ) , as can be seen more clearly in the following discussion . ] on the doubly conformal compactification of these space times .",
    "in other words , we use minkowski spacetime and ds spacetime to cover different parts of this doubly conformal compactification .",
    "although we have not seen in figure[penrose - mds ] the whole of the doubly conformal compactification of minkowski and ds / ads space times , it is rather straightforward to construct it based on the above analysis . from figure [ penrose - mds ]",
    "it is clear that antipodal points have relative coordinates @xmath111 on the penrose diagram , where we have taken @xmath107 as the length unit .",
    "the antipode of antipode , with relative coordinate @xmath112 or @xmath113 , should be itself .",
    "in fact , the electromagnetic field and electric current are of the same value , up to positive weyl factors , at these points , so it is safe to identify these points in the conformal sense .",
    "a thus extended version of figure [ penrose - mds ] is figure [ penrose - ext ] .",
    "the doubly conformal compactification of ds and minkowski space times is shown , more clearly , in figure [ penrose - double ] .",
    "note also that any pair of points related by an inversion - like transformation @xmath114 can be viewed as to have relative coordinates @xmath115 or @xmath116 on these diagrams .    .",
    "]    then we consider the @xmath46 case .",
    "similarly , we have from equations ( [ j_weyl ] ) and ( [ n_factor ] ) @xmath117\\delta^{3}(\\vect x)=e(1+t^{2})^{2}\\delta^{3}(\\vect x),\\quad j_{i}=0,\\label{n_j}\\ ] ]    with @xmath79 and @xmath80 still given by equation ( [ fundamental ] ) , where we have omitted the prime in these notations .",
    "the region of @xmath46 uncovered by the conformally flat coordinates corresponds to the ordinary conformal boundary of the minkowski spacetime . by the inversion ( [ inversion ] ) , we can examine the uncovered region ( actually a `` compactified '' light cone ) .",
    "for the electric current , we have @xmath118 for the electromagnetic field , we have also equations ( [ tilde_e ] ) and ( [ tilde_b ] ) .",
    "so we can see the breakdown of the maxwell equation at @xmath94 , similar to the ds case .",
    "unlike the ds case , however , since @xmath46 has no ( conformal ) boundary , this breakdown can not be remedied by the sign reversion ( [ reversion ] ) of @xmath57 and @xmath58 in certain regions of @xmath46 .",
    "although one can see equations ( [ n_j ] ) and ( [ n_j_inverse ] ) as the only correct form of a point - like source that satisfies the continuity equation , there is no corresponding electromagnetic field that globally satisfies the maxwell equation .",
    "in other words , one can not find fundamental solutions to the maxwell equation on @xmath46 .",
    "this problem can be resolved by cutting open @xmath46 along @xmath94 and sewing another @xmath46 ( also cut open ) onto it , which yields the double covering @xmath53 , as expected .",
    "in section 2 , we review the ordinary conformal compactification of the minkowski , ds and ads space times , where one can see that the pseudo - sphere really can help him to understand the conformal compactification .",
    "first , we get the intersection @xmath119 , which in fact is a minkowski spacetime , of the hyperplane@xmath120 and the zero radius pseudo - sphere @xmath10 in a ( 4 + 2)-dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "it s not difficult to see that the infinity points of @xmath119 lie on the hyperplane parallel to @xmath120 .",
    "the compactification [ @xmath10 ] , in which the @xmath122(2,4)/@xmath20 action can be well defined , is generated by adding those infinity points to @xmath119 .",
    "that is the compactification of minkowski spacetime . for the ds and ads case",
    ", we use a general hypersurface ( of antipodal symmetry ) to intersect @xmath10 to get some conformally flat manifolds .    in section 3 ,",
    "we map the solution to maxwell equation on minkowski spacetime ( [ fundamental ] ) to the ds spacetime to get ( [ ds_j ] ) , from which one can find that there are really two antipodal point charges .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the conformal boundary @xmath123=0 separates the world line @xmath82 into two parts . with the inversion ( [ inversion ] )",
    ", one can find that the field ( [ tilde_e ] ) is discontinuous at @xmath94 , which shows the breakdown of the maxwell equation on the compactification of minkowski spacetime .",
    "it is not hard to see that the breakdown is caused by the modulus term in equation ( [ fundamental ] ) .",
    "one should take care that in ( [ ds_inverse_j ] ) there is not a simple @xmath91 factor but a jacobian factor when one writes @xmath124 into @xmath125@xmath126 . and",
    "the condition for magnetic charge is not different .    in section 4 , the discussion in section 3",
    "is illustrated with penrose diagrams . reversing the sign of the electromagnetic field and current ( see ( [ reversion ] ) ) in `` i '' to `` iv '' in figure ( [ penrose - invds ] )",
    ", one can see the maxwell equations can be well defined on the whole ds spacetime .",
    "equation ( [ global ] ) is the global solution , and one can see that there are two antipodal point charges .",
    "we also show that the ordinary compactification , identifying `` i '' to `` iv '' with `` i@xmath110 '' to `` iv@xmath110 '' , can not give a global defined electrodynamics .",
    "this leads us to consider the doubled conformal compactification , and we reveal that superposing the familiar penrose diagrams of ds and minkowski space times ( see figure 2 ) , and identifying the regions `` i '' to `` iv '' with `` i@xmath110 '' to `` iv@xmath110 '' as antipodal regions , respectively will give the doubled compactification .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show this process clearly .",
    "and the doubled conformal compactification for the electrodynamics with a magnetic charge is very similar to the electron , which we do nt analysis here .",
    "since our attention is solely paid to the classical case here , one should further consider the conformal invariant quantum field theory containing electrodynamics correspondingly @xcite . and",
    "zero - mass systems @xcite can also be considered , including the lienard - wiechert field of massless charges @xcite .",
    "these problems should be left for future works .",
    "the cpt invariance , and causality are also some interesting aspects for our further studying .",
