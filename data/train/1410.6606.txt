    "in preparation of the first direct observations of gws with ground - based detectors , expected in the next few years , it is desirable to have gw templates for every possible initial configuration of the two - body problem , and that as precise as possible .",
    "our recent work belongs to that program , investigating in particular the gravitational radiation from hyperbolic encounters and its effects on the metric .",
    "previous work on the subject includes the newtonian treatment of the gravitational radiation field associated with non - spinning objects on unbound orbits , done by turner @xcite , it s first extension to the first pn order in the dynamics done by junker & schfer @xcite , the full 1pn corrected waveforms , including pn accurate polarization states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , available in @xcite , where a generalized true anomaly parametrization was employed .",
    "no treatment of spinning binaries on hyperbolic orbits can be found in the literature , a part from the work we review here , by de vittori et al .",
    "more details about gw radiation were described for the non - spinning case only , e.g. the quadrupolar order energy and momentum loss during the interaction @xcite and its 1pn extension @xcite , or the analytic formula for the power spectrum @xcite , which generalizes the high eccentricity limit @xcite and the parabolic limit @xcite .    in this summary",
    "we review our recent work @xcite , where we obtained temporally evolving gw polarization states for spinning compact binaries in pn accurate hyperbolic orbits .",
    "we included leading order spin - orbit interactions effects , and the conservative non - spinning orbital dynamics is 1pn accurate .",
    "therefore , we were able to describe spinning compact binaries along unbound orbits up to 1.5 pn order accuracy",
    ". additionally , we incorporated 2.5 pn radiation reaction effects while computing the quadrupolar order polarization states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .      the plots for gw signals at pn order reveal a non - vanishing difference between the wave amplitudes at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which is called the linear _ memory effect_. in the following",
    ", we will review the basic concepts of this memory , as well as some crude estimates of its amplitude at newtonian order , available in refs .",
    "@xcite and briefly summarized in @xcite .",
    "consider an ideal gw detector in which truly free - falling test masses are only sensitive to gravitational forces , like e.g. a ring of test masses in space , a pulsar timing array ( pta ) , or a lisa - like detector .",
    "a gw without memory causes the detector to return to its initial configuration . instead ,",
    "after the passage of a gw with memory the displacement state of the detector is different than long before the wave had passed .",
    "this net change in the amplitude of the metric induced by a gw is what we define as the memory effect .",
    "ground based detectors are not ideal detectors and this kind of memory can not be stored in their signal , since internal forces , e.g. the wires on the pendulum , bring the test masses back to their original positions . however , for new generation detectors and especially for pta this signature should be taken seriously into account since it appears in the polarization states already at newtonian order .",
    "the quadrupolar order gw polarization states we require for a system of two orbiting masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 at a distance @xmath6 , can be expressed through the transverse - traceless part of the radiation field @xmath7 , where the quadrupolar order contribution , as is well - known , reads @xmath8 @xmath9 being the gravitational constant , @xmath10 the speed of light , and where @xmath11 is the source mass - quadrupole moment , with the reduced mass @xmath12 , the total mass @xmath13 and the relative orbital separation components @xmath14 . using the equation of motion @xmath15 ,",
    "the second derivative of the mass - quadrupole moment reads @xmath16 and one can notice that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : iij_derivative ] ) vanishes for @xmath17 since it falls off as @xmath18 , while the relative velocities approach the finite value @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , at newtonian order the memory effect for a hyperbolic encounter can be predicted through the simple formula @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the difference between the initial and final state .",
    "the velocity directions at early and late times will thus obviously play a key role .",
    "let s suppose that the observer is perpendicular to the orbital plane , say on the @xmath22 axis . then only the components @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are non - zero .",
    "for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 components at initial and final times",
    "@xmath17 , when the polar angle is @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 using some trigonometric identities and rearranging , one can write the expected amplitude of the memory in the different components as @xmath30 one can notice that according to this crude estimate , at newtonian order and without spin , there is no memory effect in the plus polarization , while there is some difference between initial and final state in @xmath1 , depending on the initial settings of the binary .",
    "in this section , we will present how we computed pn accurate gw templates for both spinning and non - spinning binaries , in order to study the outcoming memory effect and compare our result with the theoretical predictions above .      by introducing polar",
    "coordinates @xmath31 and the constant inclination angle @xmath32 between the observer and the orbital plane , as well as the notation @xmath33 , one can show that the resulting polarization states @xmath34 can be written as a series of functions in terms of @xmath35 as @xmath36 where the single contributions can be found in ref .  @xcite . as an illustration",
    ", the newtonian expressions read    [ eq : ns_n ] @xmath37    we now want to impose the temporal evolution of the dynamics . considering the 1pn hyperbolic counterpart of the kepler equation , and using 1pn accurate expressions for the orbital elements we can compute @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 in terms of the eccentricity @xmath42 , the hyperbolic mean motion @xmath43 , the eccentric anomaly @xmath44 and the symmetric mass ratio @xmath45 :    [ eq : quasi_kepl_nonsp ] @xmath46\\,\\left\\{1+\\bar \\xi^{2/3}\\frac{3}{e_{\\rm t}^2 - 1}\\right\\}~,\\\\       \\dot{\\phi } ( v ) = \\ ; & \\frac{\\bar n\\ , \\sqrt{e_{\\rm t}^2 - 1}}{\\left(e_{\\rm t}\\cosh v-1\\right)^2}\\bigg\\{1-\\bar \\xi^{2/3}\\,\\frac{\\left[3-\\left(4-\\eta\\right)e_{\\rm t}^2+\\left(1-\\eta\\right)e_{\\rm t}\\cosh v\\right]}{\\left(e_{\\rm t}^2 - 1\\right)\\left(e_{\\rm t}\\cosh v-1\\right)}\\bigg\\}\\label{4}~ ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 stands for @xmath48 . imposing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : quasi_kepl_nonsp ] ) in the expressions for the polarization states ( [ eq : ns_n ] ) , we obtain the gravitational wave signals from non - spinning compact binaries during hyperbolic encounters , at full 1pn order . in fig .",
    "1 we display some results for two different values of @xmath42 .     for non - spinning compact binaries on hyperbolic orbits , in arbitrary units .",
    "the non - vanishing amplitude of the @xmath49 polarization at late times , the so - called memory effect , is clearly visible at newtonian order.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : ns ]    a close look at eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ns_n ] ) allows us to extract the limit case where @xmath50 ( or @xmath44 ) goes to @xmath51 . for simplicity ,",
    "let s consider again the case where the observer line - of - sight is perpendicular to the orbital plane , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "it is not very difficult to infer that the dynamical variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as well as the product @xmath55 go to zero .",
    "however , the expression for @xmath56 does not vanish as @xmath57 , but rather tends to the finite value @xmath58 .",
    "this forces the expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 at late times to be    @xmath61    note that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hp_inf ] ) is an even function of @xmath40 due to the presence of @xmath62 .",
    "however , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hc_inf ] ) is an odd function of @xmath40 .",
    "this implies that @xmath63 , while @xmath64 .    in particular , using again @xmath65 , the amplitude difference between late and early times is @xmath66 which is essentially the same result as in ref .",
    "@xcite reported in eq .",
    "( [ eq : memory_favata ] ) .",
    "this leads to the linear memory effect as visible in the @xmath67 plots in our fig .  1 .      in our recent work @xcite we also included leading order spin - orbit interaction effects .",
    "this can not be achieved in a fully analytical way , since one obtains a set of 12 coupled differential equations which have to be solved at the same time .",
    "first , one needs to introduce three eulerian angles @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , since the orbital plane is precessing due to spin effects",
    ". then we need to evolve the phasing angle @xmath68 , the spin vectors @xmath71 and @xmath72 and the orbital momentum @xmath73 .",
    "we were able to include radiation reaction effects , a 2.5pn order correction , by adding two more differential equations for the evolution of the eccentricity @xmath42 and the mean motion @xmath43 .",
    "the system contains therefore differential equations for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in sec .",
    "ii of ref .",
    "@xcite we show these relations explicitly and explain their derivation in great detail .",
    "and three different values for @xmath42 .",
    "the orbital evolution is fully 1.5pn accurate and the influences of gw emission are taken into account .",
    "the linear memory effect causes the solid line waveform plots to depart from the dashed line after the hyperbolic passage.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : sp ]    the key result , as one can see in fig .  2 ,",
    "is that spinning binaries leave a memory imprint on the metric in both the plus and the cross polarizations , due to the spin induced precession of the orbital plane and the consequent asymmetry of the initial and final state of the system .",
    "although small , the memory effect can be seen on the plot by comparing the initial value , reported by the dashed line , with the final value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we described a recently developed prescription to obtain ready  to  use pn - accurate gw templates for spinning compact binaries on hyperbolic orbits , including leading order spin - orbit coupling contributions and radiation reaction effects . in the results we notice that for spinning binaries both the plus and the cross polarization states exhibit a memory effect , i.e. a non - vanishing amplitude at time @xmath80 , whereas for non - spinning systems only the cross polarization shows such a behaviour .",
    "given the interesting feature of the memory in the gw signals , we also briefly reviewed the concept following the literature and providing a crude estimate of its amplitude at newtonian order , which is proven to agree with our results .",
    "since the waveform is strongly influenced by spin effects , the structure of such an asymmetric burst - like signal carries many informations about the system which could be useful for parameter estimation",
    ". it will be interesting to incorporate the 2pn order non - spinning contributions to our 1.5pn - accurare orbital dynamics , as well as dominant order spin - spin interactions .",
