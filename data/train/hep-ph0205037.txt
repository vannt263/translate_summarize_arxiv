    "an outstanding question in the description of hadronic interactions is the problem of the parton distribution functions at very small values of the parton momentum fraction @xmath3 ( see @xcite for a pedagogical introduction ) .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the solution of the ( linear ) bfkl equation @xcite , extended to very small values of @xmath3 , leads to cross - sections that increase asymptotically like a power of the center of mass energy , in contradiction with bounds coming from unitarity considerations .",
    "it is expected that saturation effects must limit the growth of parton distributions at small values of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that this description becomes inadequate since non - linear effects should become important at small @xmath3 when the corresponding occupation numbers reach a value comparable to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a theoretical description of this phenomenon is provided by the colored glass condensate model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "small-@xmath3 gluons are described by a classical color field , due to the fact that these modes have a large occupation number .",
    "this color field is driven by a classical yang - mills equation whose source term is provided by faster partons . as one varies the separation scale between the soft and hard modes , one obtains a renormalization group equation that provides a non - linear generalization of the bfkl evolution equation @xcite .",
    "an important parameter of the model is the saturation momentum scale , usually denoted @xmath5 and defined as the transverse momentum scale below which saturation effects become important .",
    "this scale increases with energy and with the size of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "more recently , some tests have been proposed in order to observe saturation effects in high energy hadronic or nuclear collisions . among them",
    "are the re - analysis of hera deep inelastic results under the hypothesis that the @xmath6-p cross - section is affected by saturation effects @xcite . in the field of heavy ion collisions",
    ", it has been suggested that one could predict the multiplicity by describing the two nuclei with classical color fields @xcite .",
    "this idea lead to a successful description of the observed multiplicities at rhic @xcite which is however still under debate @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed recently that saturation effects could be observed in the cleaner environment provided by ultra - peripheral heavy ion collisions @xcite since the production of heavy quark pairs is also very sensitive to the saturation scale .",
    "various studies also proposed to study saturation effects in the context of @xmath0 collisions @xcite . in this paper , we calculate the cross - section for photon production in @xmath0 collisions and show that the result is also sensitive to saturation effects .",
    "we assume that the nucleus is large enough so that it can be described in terms of classical color fields .",
    "concerning the proton , we do not make such an assumption and describe it as in ordinary perturbative calculations , in terms of parton distribution functions . in this framework ,",
    "the leading order process for photon production involves a quark from the proton that scatters off the color field of the nucleus and emits a photon by bremsstrahlung .",
    "therefore , the elementary process we consider in this paper is @xmath7 in the background of a classical color field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : amplitude ] , we formulate the amplitude for the bremsstrahlung of a photon by a quark ( or antiquark ) in the presence of a classical color field . this amplitude is then evaluated .",
    "the average over the configurations of the hard sources is performed in section [ sec : average ] . in section [ sec : xsection ] , we explain how to obtain the differential cross - section from the semi - classical amplitude derived in section [ sec : amplitude ] . in section [ sec :",
    "diffraction ] , we show that the _ diffractive _ ( i.e. with the additional constraint that the exchange between the quark and the nucleus is color singlet and carries a zero total transverse momentum ) cross - section for this process is vanishing . finally , in section [ sec : inclusive ] , we derive the inclusive photon radiation differential cross - section and show that the correlations between the outgoing quark and the photon are affected by saturation effects .",
    "we want to calculate the following processes in @xmath0 collisions @xmath8 where the quark can become either a jet or a hadron .",
    "the starting point is the amplitude : @xmath9 which , using the lsz formalism @xcite can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the quark component of the electromagnetic current , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the fermion and photon wave function renormalization factors in the following . ] , and @xmath14 is the fractional electric charge of the quark under consideration .",
    "so what we basically need is @xmath15 which , using wick s theorem , can be written as @xmath16 where the fermion feynman propagator @xmath17 is defined as due to the fact that this factor is a pure phase in the case where the background contains the classical field of a single nucleus .",
    "this phase indeed drops out of physical quantities obtained after squaring amplitudes . ]",
    "@xmath18 it should be noted that @xmath17 is the fermion propagator in the background of the strong classical color field of the nucleus .",
    "our amplitude then becomes @xmath19    the fermion propagator @xmath17 is already known from @xcite . in coordinate space and in the `` singular '' gauge , it is given by the following formula @xcite @xmath20 g_{_{f}}^{0}(x - z ) \\gamma^- g_{_{f}}^{0}(z - y)\\ ; , \\label{eq : g_fcord}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the free feynman propagator of a quark , and where @xmath22 is a unitary matrix containing the interactions between the quark and the colored glass condensate .",
    "it is convenient to separate out the interaction part of the propagator and write it in momentum space as @xmath23 where @xmath24 e^{i({\\imb q}_\\perp - { \\imb p}_\\perp)\\cdot { \\imb z}_\\perp } \\label{eq : taures}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while for a nucleus moving in the positive @xmath25 direction we have @xmath26 with @xmath27 in the fundamental representation , and where @xmath28 is the density of color sources in the nucleus .",
    "inserting this propagator in the expression for the photon production amplitude ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) , we find the following expression in momentum space @xmath29\\,u({\\imb p})\\ ; . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{eq : m } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in ( [ eq : m ] ) corresponds to emission of a photon by the quark with no scattering from the color glass condensate",
    ". this term can not contribute to the cross section for real photons and indeed vanishes ( the delta function @xmath30 has no support for on - shell particles ) .",
    "the second and third term , respectively , correspond to the case when the quark multiply scatters from the color glass condensate before and after emission of the photon .",
    "the last term describes the case when the quark multiply scatters from the color glass condensate , then emits a photon and again , multiply scatters from the color glass condensate .",
    "those processes are illustrated in the figure [ fig : processes ] .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : m ] ) is an exact formula for the bremsstrahlung of a quark in a colored glass condensate .",
    "indeed , it resums the interactions to all orders with the classical background field , as required by the large gluon density in the nucleus .",
    "now we will show that the last term also vanishes . to show this",
    ", it is sufficient to consider the structure of the poles in the propagators in the last term .",
    "one has the following structure @xmath31 since both @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then @xmath34 as well as @xmath35 .",
    "this means that both @xmath36 poles are below the real axis .",
    "therefore , one can close the integration contour above the real axis and get a vanishing contribution .",
    "the only exception to this argument would occur if there were terms proportional to @xmath36 in the numerator which can compensate the @xmath36 in the denominator , a situation in which the theorem of residues would give a nonzero contribution from the half circle at infinity used to close the contour . to investigate this case ,",
    "we write explicitly the terms which contain @xmath36 in the numerator of the last term .",
    "we have @xmath37 since @xmath38 , equation ( [ eq : num ] ) identically vanishes . therefore , the last term in the amplitude ( [ eq : m ] ) is zero . that this term vanishes has a simple physical explanation .",
    "indeed , in this term the quark first scatters off the nucleus , then propagates for a while and emits the photon , then propagates again and finally reinteracts with the nucleus .",
    "note that the intermediate free propagations are off - shell and take some nonzero amount of time .",
    "but since the nucleus moves at the speed of light in the @xmath39 direction in our model , it is already far away behind the quark by the time the photon has been emitted , and a second scattering of the quark off the nucleus can not happen ) vanishes would not be applicable if the nucleus was moving at a speed @xmath40 . indeed , in that case we would not have the delta functions implying the conservation of the @xmath41 component of the quark momentum , and we could have poles on both sides of the real @xmath36 axis . ] .",

    "there is however a complication due to collinear singularities , i.e. singularities that show up when the emitted photon is parallel to the outgoing quark .",

    ", all the quantum evolution effects would go into this object via the averaging procedure in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - def ] ) .",
    "one can also note that this result exhibits the standard collinear denominator @xmath125 ^ 2 $ ] that vanishes if the photon is emitted collinearly to the quark .",
    "this aspect of the result is of course not affected by the description of the target nucleus as a color glass condensate .    in the soft photon limit",
    ", one can see the decoupling of the photon emission subprocess from the quark scattering part .",

    "therefore , this expression has all the features of the bremsstrahlung of a photon by a quark scattering off a parton inside the nucleus with the exchange of a gluon in the t - channel ( this term is the dominant one at large center of mass energy ) .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inccs ] ) , the only factor that depends crucially on the saturation hypothesis for the nucleus is the factor @xmath131 .",
    "indeed , this term contains all the dependence on the saturation scale , as well as the modifications of the transverse momentum spectrum at scales below @xmath5 .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of this object is illustrated in figure [ fig : ck ] .    in order to observe effects due to this factor",
    ", it would be useful to measure both the radiated photon and the jet induced by the outgoing quark .",
    "the photon - jet correlations , and in particular the distribution of their total transverse momentum @xmath132 , would indeed enable one to extract in a rather direct way the function @xmath122 itself .",
    "on the contrary , if one measures only the photon spectrum , one can access only a given moment of this function .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the photon production in @xmath0 collisions by bremsstrahlung of a quark in the saturated color field of the nucleus .",
    "we have shown that the cross - section for this process depends sensitively on saturation effects .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that photon bremsstrahlung diagrams which are , in the standard perturbation theory , higher order compared to the direct photon diagrams , become leading order . this is due to the presence of a strong color field @xmath1 in the target nucleus which compensates for the factor of @xmath133 from quark - quark - gluon vertex .",
    "experimentally , it may be an easier task to look for a photon and a jet pair rather than a single jet .",
    "this was studied in the context of heavy ion collisions in @xcite .",
    "therefore one can directly measure the correlator @xmath122 that describes the interactions of a high energy probe with the target nucleus .",
    "it should be noted that saturation effects become larger in the forward region and therefore easier to measure experimentally .",
    "it is straightforward to extend this calculation to the case of production of dileptons and di - photons .",
    "this is currently under investigation .",
    "another interesting extension of this work would be to study the radiation of a gluon by a quark as it moves through the classical field of the nucleus . in that case",
    ", the emitted gluon can also interact with the background classical field , which makes the calculation of this process more involved .",
