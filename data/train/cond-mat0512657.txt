    "occasionally some of the research results on older topics give excellent insights to the subsequent researches .",
    "one of the such works is the recent work on the drifted edward - wilkinson ( ew ) equation @xmath8 with a fixed boundary condition ( fbc ) @xmath9 @xcite . if the diffusion term @xmath10 is ignored in eq .",
    "( [ dew ] ) , one can obtain roughness exponent @xmath11 , growth exponent @xmath12 and dynamic exponent @xmath13 by a scaling argument and some other methods ( [ dew ] ) @xcite .",
    "but for periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) , the drift term @xmath14 is irrelevant , and thus eq . ( [ dew ] ) becomes physically equivalent to the normal ew equation @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , if fbc instead pbc is imposed , the roughness of surface described by eq .",
    "( [ dew ] ) is exactly proved to show an anomalous behavior with the exponents @xcite , @xmath19 the exact solution for eq .",
    "( [ dew ] ) @xcite gives us an excellent insight to understand the role of the drift term and the boundary condition as a relevant extension of the normal ew equation .",
    "the drift term and the diffusion term are crucial for anomalous exponents under fbc @xcite . without the drift term , the maximum time which the roughness is fully developed for the system is order of @xmath20 .",
    "if the system is affected by the drift , the time scale that any noise - generated local structure starts from one boundary to the other boundary is @xmath21 .",
    "the fluctuation of the surface width is saturated after this time scale .",
    "therefore @xmath22 and thus one can get the anomalous exponents ( [ aewx ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , local width is numerically studied to test the validity of this physical mechanism .",
    "the local width is increased as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the position where the width is measured .",
    "but the definition of the local width is not physically clear and there is a sort of difficulty to measure @xmath25 for the small system .    for last two decades ,",
    "the stochastic discrete growth models whose dynamical scaling behavior is identical to those of a given continuum growth equation have been used to investigate the dynamical scaling behavior for the corresponding surface roughness @xcite .",
    "the stochastic discrete growth model is a powerful tool which simplifies the complicate growth behavior and provides an essential link between theory and experiments .",
    "for example , the surface growth which is described by normal ew equation has been studied through the family model @xcite . but",
    "no simple growth model which exactly corresponds to the drifted ew equation with fbc has been suggested yet .",
    "other existing models can not explain the anomalous behavior of the surface fluctuation which comes from the drift term and fbc in eq .",
    "( [ dew ] ) .",
    "first motivation of this paper is thus to make a simple stochastic discrete model which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ dew ] ) with fbc using a stochastic analysis method @xcite .",
    "second motivation of this paper is in the explanation of the physical mechanism which causes the anomalous behavior ( [ aewx ] ) by using a height - height correlation function .",
    "the height - height correlation function can be easily treated through our handy stochastic discrete model . as mentioned above , the local width @xcite is somewhat unmature physical quantity and has not been widely used for the analysis of surface roughness @xcite .",
    "in contrast , height - height correlation function has been extensively used to show the exact dynamic scaling in the surface growth physics @xcite .",
    "the height - height correlation function which we will use to analyze the surface with fbc is an average of height differences or of squared height differences between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 @xmath29 is the distance from a boundary @xmath30 at time @xmath31 . if we know the height - height correlation function between two fixed boundaries , we can get clean and clear information how the saturated surface of whole system is formed . we will measure the height - height correlation function and explain the anomalous behavior ( [ aewx ] ) through it .",
    "third motivation of this paper is to suggest about a new type queuing phenomena originated from the analysis of the height - height correlation function . queuing @xcite is a common nonequilibrium phenomenon in nature .",
    "it is well established that many driven flow processes belong to the same universality class as kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) type growth of one dimensional interfaces @xcite .",
    "for example , a traffic jam @xcite caused by slow and fast bond of the so - called asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite is related to the faceting on kpz growth .",
    "asep breaks translational invariance in many ways .",
    "one of them is to retain periodic boundary conditions , but to introduce a defect into the system by modifying the transition rates locally @xcite . by properly chosen injection / removal rates or defect strength",
    ", nonequilibrium phase transitions occur between profiles of different shapes and average densities . in our model , we map the fixed boundary condition to a defect which exists on the center of system .",
    "the defect site means that the growth at a certain site is impossible or is controlled by a probability @xmath32 which is called a defect strength .",
    "that is , the fixed boundary condition @xmath33 is shifted by the mapping @xmath34 to the defect site @xmath35 with the periodic boundary condition . for @xmath36 any deposition or evaporation process at @xmath37 can not occur ( @xmath38 ) , since the strength of the defect is absolutely strong and thus the surface heights can not be freely increased by the defect . if @xmath39 , the deposition or evaporation process at @xmath37 is accepted by @xmath32 and the system with @xmath40 is the same as pbc without the defect .",
    "the height - height correlation function of our stochastic discrete model shows lateral asymmetry @xmath41 around the defect , in contrast to kpz - type queuing phenomena or asep which shows up - down symmetry breaking under the transformation @xmath42 .",
    "the new queuing phenomena from the drifted ew equation ( [ dew ] ) with a defect is physically different from usual asep or queuing phenomena which is related to the nonlinearity of kpz equation @xcite , because it is from the linearity of the drifted ew equation ( [ dew ] ) .",
    "therefore it is very interesting to compare our new queuing phenomena to earlier studied kpz type queuing phenomena . in this paper , we want to investigate new queuing phenomena from the defect and the drift using our stochastic discrete model and apply it to the parking garage model @xcite .",
    "in this section , we introduce a new method to make a discrete stochastic growth model which physically corresponds to the continuum equation . normally the surface configuration is described by the continuum langevin equation @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 depends on the surface configuration @xmath45 . in the method ,",
    "the surface configurations are described in terms of integer height variables as @xmath46 on a lattice . then the continuum equation ( [ gste ] )",
    "can be discretized into @xmath47 associated with eq .",
    "( [ dste ] ) , the general master equation @xcite for the surface evolution can be written as @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the transition rate from the configuration @xmath50 to the configuration @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the probability that the system is in the configuration @xmath50 at time @xmath31 . using the transition moments @xcite @xmath53 and @xmath54 the master equation ( [ master ] )",
    "can be rewritten as fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath55 \\cr & + & \\sum_{i , j } \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial h_i \\partial h_j } [ k_{ij}^{(2)}(h ) p(h , t)]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by kramers - moyal expansion .",
    "therefore we can obtain the discrete version of equivalent langevin equation from eq .",
    "( [ fpe ] ) as @xmath56 and thus @xmath57 is equal to @xmath58 of eq .",
    "( [ dste ] ) . here",
    "the noise @xmath59 has the properties @xmath60 and @xmath61 . when the noise is white , @xmath62 is equal to @xmath63 .",
    "normally the evolution process in a stochastic surface growth model is defined by one - particle deposition or evaporation in a unit evolution process @xcite . hence if only one - particle deposition(@xmath64 ) or evaporation(@xmath65 ) is imposed at a randomly chosen site @xmath66 in a unit evolution process , then @xmath57 and @xmath62 are @xmath67 from eqs .",
    "( [ tm1 ] ) and ( [ tm2 ] ) , where @xmath68 is @xmath69 and @xmath70 is @xmath71.then from the eq .",
    "( [ km ] ) , these rates are @xmath72 @xmath73 here we impose the unit step function @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 , to the transition rates @xmath68 and @xmath70 , because the transition rates must be always positive . if @xmath59 is the local white noise , the evolution site @xmath66 is randomly chosen to apply the rates ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "now we want to describe the discrete stochastic model which exactly correspond to eq .",
    "( [ gste ] ) on an one - dimensional ( @xmath79 ) substrate in detail .",
    "generalization to that on higher - dimensional substrates can easily be obtained from the description of the @xmath79 model .",
    "the discrete model is defined by the following steps .",
    "( i ) select a site @xmath66 randomly .",
    "( ii ) calculate the deposition rate ( the rate for @xmath80 ) @xmath68 and the evaporation rate ( the rate for @xmath81 ) @xmath70 from eqs .",

    "( we set @xmath82 . )",
    "( iii ) compare a random number @xmath83 with the deposition probability @xmath84 and the evaporation probability @xmath85 .",
    "if @xmath86 , take the deposition process",
    ". otherwise take the evaporation process .",
    "we now report the numerical results of our stochastic discrete model for the drifted ew equation with the defect which is controlled by a strength @xmath32 .",
    "the initial surface is always set to be flat ( @xmath87 ) and the lateral periodic condition is always imposed .",
    "all data are taken by average over more than 500 independent runs .",
    "we first explain the scaling properties of the surface width for several defect strengths @xmath32 .",
    "the first transition moment @xmath88 of drifted ew equation ( [ dew ] ) at a randomly selected site @xmath66 is @xmath89_i \\cr & = & \\nu_2 [ h_{i+1 } + h_{i-1 } -2h_i ] -\\frac{v}{2 } [ h_{i+1 } -h_{i-1}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 for eq .",
    "( [ dew ] ) .",
    "we check the dynamical scaling behaviors for other parameter values to obtain the same behaviors for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "@xmath100 satisfies the scaling relation @xmath101 with @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath40 .",

    "in contrast , as soon as the growth at the defect is allowed even with a very low probability , we get @xmath160 , which is almost the same as roughness exponent @xmath161 of ew universality class .",
    "( see the data for @xmath103 in fig .",
    "therefore the anomalous behavior @xmath162 for @xmath36 disappears and are changed into @xmath163 as soon as the defect condition is released or for @xmath112 .         against the position @xmath66 .",
    "used system size is @xmath134 . ]",

    "is pushed by the drift and transmitted all over the system .",
    "then the flow of the surface structure comes back through the boundary suddenly disappears at the defect .",
    "therefore the height - height correlation function shows the asymmetry @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "this asymmetric behavior of @xmath126 and @xmath130 is a unique behavior for the drifted ew equation with a perfect defect .",
    "in contrast the height - height correlation function around a defect for kpz - type surface growth @xcite always shows the lateral symmetry @xmath169 . in kpz - type surface growth model with the defect @xcite , the height - height correlation function @xmath170 changes from @xmath171 for @xmath172 to @xmath173 for @xmath174 .",
    "it means that the queueing effect of the defect spreads out entire system ( @xmath174 ) or affects only around region of the defect ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "the phase transition argument of kpz - type surface growth is analogous to the queuing effect by a defect which is located at a certain point of lane @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the height - height correlation functions which we measured always maintains the simple power behavior @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "instead , it shows the sudden crossover of the exponents @xmath175 and @xmath176 as soon as the defect is weakly imposed ( or @xmath177 ) .",
    "that is , the effect of the defect and the drift influences only when the defect strength is absolutely strong ( or @xmath36 ) .",
    "the asymmetric form of the interface profile by the defect and drift can be applied to a kind of the queuing phenomena or car condensation in a parking garage model @xcite .",
    "let s think of the traffic flow of cars on an one - dimensional road with a periodic boundary condition ( or a ring - type road ) .",
    "the defect site in our model is then reinterpreted as the parking garage ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . initially",
    "all cars on the road are equally distributed everywhere on the road as shown in fig .",
    "if the drift ew equation ( [ dew ] ) with a defect ( garage ) describes a queuing phenomena , the absolute gradient of the height @xmath178 at @xmath66-th site can be mapped to the effective speed @xmath179 of a car around the site @xmath66 at the given moment @xmath31 due to the drift term @xmath180 . in the steady state the car density @xmath181 at the site @xmath66 is then inversely proportional to @xmath182 as @xmath183 for @xmath36 in the saturated state ( or steady state ) when @xmath184 .",
    "@xmath185 increases very rapidly as @xmath66 increases from the defect position and immediately reaches a certain average value .",
    "average value remains until @xmath66 approaches the defect site from the left , and @xmath185 grows very rapidly to the highest value in the limit @xmath186 .",
    "these results correspond to the following steady - state traffic flow .",
    "the cars slowly move out from the parking garage by a sort obstruction at the exit or by a lazy parking charge collector .",
    "thus they are packed near the exit of the garage and the density @xmath187 of cars at the exit is very high .",
    "as soon as cars enter the road , the speed and car density reach to the average value @xmath188 and maintain the average values in the middle of road .",
    "when cars come close to the entrance of the garage , the speed of cars gets much faster . therefore the density of cars at the entrance becomes very low .",
    "in this paper , we presented a simple stochastic discrete model which describes the drifted ew equation ( [ dew ] ) with a defect . from the simple model",
