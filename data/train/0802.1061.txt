    "the standard model ( sm ) describes the electroweak ( ew ) interactions with an incredible precision .",
    "however , the instability of the higgs potential under radiative corrections signals our ignorance over the real mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and has lead to many extensions beyond the sm .",
    "the upcoming lhc era is likely to provide us the tools to check some of the proposed solutions to this problem .",
    "recently , grinstein , oconnell and wise proposed a new extension of the sm  @xcite , based on the ideas of lee and wick @xcite for a finite theory of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the building block of the lee - wick proposal is to consider that the pauli - villars regulator describes a physical degree of freedom . in the lee - wick standard model ( lwsm ) , this idea is extended to all the sm in such a way that the theory is free from quadratic divergences and the hierarchy problem is solved .",
    "every sm field has a lw - partner with an associated lw - mass , these masses are the only new parameters in the minimal lwsm .",
    "a potential problem in this model is that the lw - states violate causality at the microscopic level due to the opposite sign of their propagators .",
    "however the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argued that there is no causality violation on a macroscopic scale provided that the lw - particles are heavy and decay to sm - particles .",
    "the lwsm can be thought as an effective theory coming from a higher derivative theory .",
    "however , to insure perturbative unitarity , higher dimension operators can not be of any type , only those compatible with a lw effective lagrangian are acceptable @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown with a specific example that unitarity is preserved due to the unusual sign of the lw - particles width .",
    "further considerations on the unitarity of the theory have been presented extensively in the previous literature @xcite , the non - perturbative formulation has been discussed in @xcite and the one - loop renormalization of lw - gauge theories has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "recent work discussed the suppression of flavor changing neutral currents @xcite , gravitational lw particles @xcite and the possibility of coupling the effective theory to heavy particles @xcite . on the phenomenological side , the implications for lhc @xcite and ilc @xcite",
    "have also been discussed .",
    "the lwsm does not provide any information on the origin of the lw - masses .",
    "however , in order to solve the hierarchy problem these masses should not be heavier than a few tev",
    ". on the other hand , the lw particles can not be too light without getting in conflict with ew precision observables  @xcite .",
    "therefore the aim of our work is to carry out an analysis of the electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) and derive bounds on the masses of the lwsm .",
    "since the main motivation to introduce the lwsm was to solve the hierarchy problem , large lw - masses will be a source of fine - tuning and will partially spoil the original motivation . in this way the success of the lwsm is associated to its efficiency to pass the ewpt without introducing a severe fine - tuning in the theory .",
    "on the experimental side , determining the parameter space allowed by the ewpt is crucial to know whether the lwsm could be tested or not in the next experiments , in particular at the lhc .    with these motivations",
    "we have performed an analysis of the ew observables in the lwsm . as in the original formulation  @xcite",
    ", we have assumed the principle of minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) to simplify the flavor structure of the model .",
    "the most stringent constraints come from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 peskin - takeuchi parameters  @xcite .",
    "we present our results as lower bounds on different combinations of the lw - masses of the gauge and quark fields .",
    "if we assume degenerate lw - masses for all the fields , the lw - scale allowed by the ewpt is of order 5 tev and there is little chance to test this model at the lhc . relaxing the constraint on equal masses",
    ", it is possible to find configurations in the parameter space where one of the masses can be as low as @xmath2 tev , at the price of rising the other masses to be @xmath5 tev .",
    "this situation is more favorable from the experimental side and it might be accessible at the lhc .",
    "concerning the fine - tuning of the model , a heavy higgs gives further contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath1 pointing in the same direction as the contributions from the lw - fields , and for this reason is strongly disfavoured .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a light higgs one has to cancel the rather large contributions to the higgs mass from the lw - particles running in the loops , that are proportional to the lw - masses squared .",
    "we estimate the needed tuning of the model to be at least of order a few per cent .    a possible way to relax the constraints from the ewpt would be to generate an extra positive contribution to @xmath1 without increasing at the same time the @xmath0 parameter . by including a fourth generation of fermions of sm - type , with their corresponding lw - partners , it is possible to generate a large @xmath1 , without generating a too large @xmath0 . to obtain a @xmath1 parameter of the needed size one has to assume an approximate custodial symmetry for the yukawas of the fourth generation .",
    "we show that for vector lw - masses of order 3 tev and yukawa masses of the fourth generation in the range @xmath6 tev , it is possible to have all the fermionic lw - masses in the range @xmath4 tev and pass the ewpt .",
