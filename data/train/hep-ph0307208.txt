    "a particularly interesting quantity is the transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) distribution of the produced higgs boson . in particular , a precise knowledge of the higgs @xmath1 distribution",
    "is important for determining an optimal set of cuts on the final state particles . in the past , the study of the transverse momentum distribution in drell - yan lepton pair and electroweak boson production helped to establish the validity of the soft gluon resummation formalism for the distribution at small @xmath1 , and played an important part in determining the standard model ( sm ) electroweak parameters .",
    "reliable predictions for transverse momentum distributions at small @xmath1 can only be obtained if soft gluon emission effects are correctly taken into account .",
    "the soft radiation manifests itself in the presence of large logarithmic corrections in the theoretical expressions .",
    "the two prominent examples are recoil logarithms of the form @xmath4 and threshold logarithms of the form of @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 ) .",
    "a finite result can be recovered by resumming these corrections to all orders in @xmath7 . to date , the most studied method for resumming the recoil ( or ` sudakov ' ) corrections in transverse momentum distribution for vector boson ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) production is the impact parameter ( @xmath0 , fourier conjugate to @xmath1 , space ) formalism , also known as the collins  soper  sterman ( css ) formalism  @xcite .",

    "the css formalism resums logarithms arising from arbitrarily soft gluon emission and therefore needs a prescription for dealing with the landau pole .",
    "originally this was incorporated by introducing an arbitrary ( inverse energy ) scale ( @xmath11 ) above which the perturbatively calculated expression remained constant , i.e. ` frozen ' at @xmath11 .",
    "additionally , a gaussian function , for example @xmath12 in its simplest form , was introduced to correct the formalism for non - perturbative effects at large @xmath0 , i.e. intrinsic transverse momentum .",
    "the parameters of this function are in principle determined from experiment through fits to the data . in the case of drell - yan lepton pair or electroweak boson production ,",
    "determining the size of the contribution associated with the incoming quarks can be done relatively precisely since there is a significant amount of experimental data available .",
    "other methods for dealing with the landau singularity have also been proposed in the literature .",
    "the approach of  @xcite , initially developed for the joint formalism and later applied to the @xmath0 space formalism in  @xcite , relies on performing the inverse fourier transform from @xmath0 to @xmath1 space as an integral along a contour in the complex @xmath0 plane .",
    "it returns a well - defined resummed distribution for all nonzero values of @xmath1 , even without introducing any extra function .",

    "a common hypothesis is that the parameters for this ( @xmath14 ) channel can be determined by multiplying one of the parameters of the function for drell - yan ( @xmath15 ) production by a factor of @xmath16 , although to the best of our knowledge there is no rigorous theoretical basis for this procedure .    in this paper",

    "the value of @xmath129 is determined from a simple fit to the @xmath1 distribution data where the only other quantity fitted is the overall normalization ; @xmath79 is kept fixed at the value determined from the fits to the dy data and the error on @xmath79 is not taken into account . the resulting error on the fitted value of @xmath129",
    "is therefore superficially small .",
    "nevertheless , it remains true that the central value of the effective @xmath129 is closer to the value predicted by the parametrization  ( [ afnp ] ) with  ( [ afnp : param ] ) than by the same parameterization with the @xmath130 coefficient multiplied by @xmath16  the equivalent of the @xmath0 space prescription of rescaling the @xmath53 coefficient by @xmath16 .",
    "it therefore becomes an attractive alternative to consider other possible modifications to the values of the parameters , determined for the drell - yan type processes , to describe processes with gluons in the initial state .",
    "following the @xmath0 space analysis presented in the previous section , we make the choice of adjusting the @xmath131 parameter while keeping @xmath132 unchanged and the parameter @xmath130 either unchanged or rescaled by @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting values of the parameter @xmath131 are : @xmath133 gev@xmath127 and @xmath134 for the former and latter model , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the errors is a straightforward consequence of the large errors on the effective parameters @xmath135 for the bins in @xmath43 .",
    "as discussed previously , in the resummation framework the @xmath1 distribution for the gluon - fusion induced higgs production process is obtained assuming that the contribution has the same form as the function for drell - yan type processes  but with the @xmath53 or a corresponding parameter rescaled by a factor of @xmath16 .",
    "the results presented in the previous two sections may suggest exercising some caution when applying this hypothesis .    in this section",
    "we focus on the effect of the function on predictions for the higgs @xmath1 distribution , in both the @xmath0 space and @xmath1 space approach .",
    "in addition , we discuss the changes made to the coefficients of the function(s ) to allow for gluons in the initial state and the impact of these modifications on the predictions for the higgs @xmath1 distribution .",
    "first , we focus on the @xmath0 space function . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ gvalhiggs ] , the central values of the effective parameters @xmath86 for @xmath136  tev are rather close to each other , irrespective of the different treatments of the @xmath137 coefficients discussed above . however , the significant errors on the coefficients @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath87 result in an even more pronounced error on the effective parameter @xmath86 in each model .",
    "the errors are larger in models in which the @xmath53 coefficient is rescaled by @xmath16 , as the errors get rescaled together with the central values . if we assume the mass of the higgs boson to be @xmath138 gev , the effective values are : @xmath139 for the model with @xmath53 rescaled by @xmath16 and @xmath52 , @xmath87 unchanged , @xmath140 for the model with @xmath53 rescaled by @xmath16 , @xmath52 modified and @xmath87 unchanged , @xmath141 for the model with @xmath53 , @xmath87 unchanged and @xmath52 modified .",
    "the next step is to implement the function  ( [ fnpeff ] ) with these effective values of @xmath86 into the resummed formalism .",
    "again , we view the spread in the central values of @xmath86 due to various models , together with the error bands on @xmath86 in each model , as a measure of the theoretical error on the effective parameter @xmath86 .",
    "consequently , we present the higgs @xmath1 distributions for the smallest and the largest value of @xmath86 allowed by the error bands for all models .",
    "these values both happen to come from the model with @xmath53 rescaled by @xmath16 , @xmath52 modified and @xmath87 unchanged , and correspond to @xmath142 and @xmath143 .    figure  [ higgs ] shows the predicted transverse momentum distribution of the higgs boson at the lhc calculated in the framework of the standard @xmath0 space resummation with the effective parametrization of the form  ( [ fnpeff ] ) for two ` extreme ' values of @xmath86 listed above .",
    "the resummed predictions are accurate up to nnll level , i.e. they include the nnll coefficients @xmath144 as well as a numerical estimate of the coefficient @xmath88  @xcite , rescaled by @xmath16 . the matching is performed at the leading - order level .",
    "we assume @xmath138  gev and use mrst2001 parton distribution functions .",
    "we find , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , only a very small dependence of the theoretical predictions on the exact values of the parameters .",

    "[ avalhiggs ] .",
    "however , due to the large errors on the central values of @xmath145 associated with each model , the range of possible values of @xmath145 is an order of magnitude large .",

    "the @xmath1 space distribution is calculated assuming the effective function of the form  ( [ f : np : pt ] ) with a coefficient @xmath155 gev@xmath127 and the best fit value of @xmath156 gev .",
    "the value of @xmath157 gev@xmath127 is an average of the central values of @xmath145 in the various models of treating the @xmath158 coefficients discussed above .",
    "the @xmath1 space prediction agrees reasonably well with the @xmath0 space prediction in the small @xmath1 regime .",
    "the gap between the locations of the peaks of the distributions gets narrower for smaller values of @xmath79 as well as smaller values of @xmath145 . at larger values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the predictions of the two formalisms differ substantially .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0 space distribution , even after matching with the fixed - order result , is eventually going to turn negative at sufficiently large @xmath1 .",
    "this happens because the matching relies on the perturbative fixed - order result , known up to a certain order in @xmath7 . at one order higher than the matching accuracy ,",
    "the resummed expression introduces logarithmic terms which will not be cancelled by the terms coming from the matching term @xmath89 in  ( [ match ] ) .",
    "since here matching is performed only at the lo level , the negative behaviour of the matched resummed distribution at large @xmath1 is quite pronounced . in the numerical realisation of the @xmath1 space method",
    ", only a subset of subleading higher order terms is summed .",
    "consequently , the matched resummed distribution becomes negative at much larger values of @xmath1 , increasing the range of applicability of the resummation approach .",
    "as the analytic results for the nlo @xmath1 higgs distribution are available in the literature  @xcite , it is possible to improve the accuracy of results presented here by performing matching at the nlo .",
    "however , our main goal here is to ( re-)examine the influence of the function on the @xmath1 distribution and for that purpose we consider the lo matching sufficient .",
    "the nnll resummed @xmath0 space resulted matched to the nlo fixed - order expression was recently obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the problem of the negative large @xmath1 behaviour is normally solved by simply switching from the matched resummed cross section to the fixed order cross section ( at an appropriate value of @xmath1 ) to obtain the cross section valid at all @xmath1 .    at low values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the @xmath0 space predictions for the two choices of @xmath86 values are close to each other , in agreement with the conclusions of ref .",
    "the effect of changing the part is felt , albeit slightly , at all values of @xmath49 .",
    "in contrast , all the predictions from the @xmath1 space formalism are already _ equal _ at @xmath159  gev . around this value ,",
    "the @xmath1 space formalism begins to return a ` pure ' perturbative part ( the sudakov factor ) without any contamination .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "[ ks : fnp ] , that for @xmath160 and in the limit @xmath161 the @xmath1 space expression for the resummed cross section has only purely perturbative content . in the region of @xmath49 where the @xmath49 space predictions differ ,",
    "the dependence on the values of the effective parameter @xmath145 is , however , much stronger than the analogous dependence on the parameter @xmath86 in @xmath0 space . for lower values of @xmath145 than the central value @xmath162 gev@xmath127 , the position of the peak and the value of the distribution at the peak changes significantly . in the case of the lower value of @xmath163",
    "gev@xmath127 the value of the distribution at the peak is around 5% larger than the corresponding value for @xmath155 gev@xmath127 and the peak location moves by about 4  gev towards smaller values of @xmath1 . for values of @xmath145 larger than the central value ,",
    "the difference in the shape of the distributions is not so significant at moderate @xmath1 .",
    "space formalism , the distribution becomes unphysical for large values of @xmath145 ( corresponding to a strongly peaked distribution ) at very small @xmath1 . ]",
    "we believe that the difference between the @xmath0space and @xmath1space predictions for the central values of the coefficients in the small @xmath1 region originates in the essential differences in the methods for accounting for effects in the two formalisms .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 space formalism requires a prescription to regularize the argument of @xmath7 at large @xmath0 .",
    "this is achieved by introducing the quantity @xmath11 as in eq .",
    "[ bstar ] .",
    "the @xmath1 space formalism , in turn , does not require any regularization prescription . the error band on the predictions of the higgs @xmath49 distribution in the @xmath49 formalism , obtained by considering distributions for the two ` extreme ' values of @xmath145 , i.e. @xmath163 gev@xmath127 and @xmath164 gev@xmath127 , is much larger than the corresponding error band from the @xmath0 space method . in particular",
    ", the lower value of @xmath145 denotes the broadest gaussian component allowed , so that the contribution from the perturbative part is minimised in comparison with the other ( allowed ) values of @xmath145 .",
    "however , it needs to be stressed that apart from intrinsic differences in the formalisms the methods of determining @xmath86 and @xmath145 coefficients for the drell - yan processes differ  to obtain the effective @xmath145 coefficients we varied @xmath79 which resulted in relatively large errors on the values of the determined parameters .",
    "it is possible that a more accurate determination of the parameters would reduce the size of the error band on the predictions for the higgs @xmath49 distribution in the @xmath49 space formalism .",
    "it is also true that allowing @xmath165 to vary while determining the @xmath86 parameters would lead to a larger error band on the predictions from the @xmath0 space formalism .",
    "nevertheless , the larger error band on the @xmath49 space results may suggest that the corresponding theoretical uncertainty on the predictions obtained with the help of the @xmath0 space formalism is underestimated .",
    "an alternative method for determining the values of the parameters for the @xmath1 space ansatz  ( [ afnp ] ) relies on fixing @xmath79 while fitting data for the effective parameters @xmath145 .",
    "this method of finding the coefficients for the @xmath1 space parameterization corresponds in a much more direct way to the @xmath0 space analysis and results in a significant decrease in the errors bars on the value of the coefficients . however , when applied it returns a considerably larger value of @xmath104 for the fits for the @xmath166 and @xmath167 parameters .",
    "we have performed detailed fits of the resummed theoretical predictions to the drell - yan data on the @xmath1 distributions for both the low @xmath43 fixed target experiments and the @xmath9 boson distribution data from the tevatron @xmath105 collider . from these fits we established values of the components present in the resummed expressions .",
    "the fits were performed for two resummation formalisms : the well - known @xmath0 space formalism and the @xmath49 space formalism . in both cases the parametrization is assumed to take the form of a simple gaussian with a logarithmic dependence on @xmath43 and @xmath120 .",
    "the resummed expressions for the higgs @xmath49 distribution in the gluon - gluon fusion production process also require a parametrization of effects .",
    "however , one may expect that the @xmath14 initial state relevant for higgs production will have a different function supplementing the resummed expressions compared to the @xmath81 drell - yan process .",
    "we used a combination of theoretical intuition and a fit of the resummed distribution to data on @xmath2 production in hadron - hadron collisions ( which is also predominantly characterized by the @xmath14 initial state ) to determine the values of the coefficients in the corresponding functions . to summarize , we see a difference in the peak region of the higgs transverse momentum distribution between the @xmath0 and @xmath49 space predictions . in the latter case ,",
    "the dependence is significant at lower @xmath49 but dies off rather rapidly with @xmath49 . for the @xmath0 space prediction , in contrast",
    ", the variation is smaller at low @xmath49 but more persistent at higher @xmath49 .",
    "we believe that we are unable to rule out any of the predictions described in this study on the basis of theory and experiment , and therefore that the corresponding span in the predictions is a measure of the true uncertainty on the theoretical prediction for the small @xmath1 higgs distribution .",
    "we note also that the uncertainty in the higgs @xmath49 distribution due to the component in the @xmath49 space method seems to be larger than in the @xmath0 space method",
