    "a soliton is a special type of solitary wave ( a hump- or dip - shaped nonlinear wave ) which preserves its shape and speed , even after collisions with other solitary wave .",
    "it arises because of the balance between the effects of nonlinearity and dispersion ( when the effect of dissipation is negligible in comparison with those of the nonlinearity and dispersion ) .",
    "one - dimensional solitons into plasma physics were first considered in 1963 by gurevich and pitaevskii  @xcite .",
    "modulational instabilities are responsible for the formation of langmuir envelope solitons ( cavitons )  @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic envelope solitons were investigated for the first time by hasegawa  @xcite and karpman  @xcite . currently , many types of solitons in plasmas are known , e. g. one - dimensional solitons and two or three - dimensional solitons  @xcite .",
    "they are invoked in various physical theories , especially for the construction of different versions of strong turbulence theory . in order for solitons to be applicable in these theories",
    "it is necessary that they be stable .",
    "therefore , the problem of soliton stability is of particular importance  @xcite .",
    "quantum plasmas are ubiquitous and appear in different physical settings from laser - matter interaction experiments ( e.g. , the compressed hydrogen in the fast ignition scenario of inertial fusion is in a quantum plasma state ) , to astrophysical and cosmological objects  @xcite ( e.g. , interstellar or molecular clouds , planetary rings , comets , interiors of white dwarf stars , etc . ) , nanostructures  @xcite , and microelectronic devices  @xcite . at room temperature and standard metallic densities , the electron gas in an ordinary metal is a good example of a quantum plasma system . in such plasmas , quantum mechanical effects ( e.g. , tunneling ) are important since the de broglie wavelength of the charge carriers ( e.g. , electrons and holes or positrons ) is comparable to the dimension of the system .",
    "recently , the topic of quantum plasmas has attracted considerable attention  @xcite and it is desirable that a good understanding of the basic phenomena of quantum plasmas and be achieved .    in classical plasmas ,",
    "nonlinear phenomena are often formulated in terms of completely integrable evolution equations of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) or nonlinear schrodinger equation ( nls ) type  @xcite .",
    "these completely integrable equations , as is well known , admit n - soliton solutions , derivable from the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) method .    in plasma ,",
    "large amplitude langmuir waves can initiate a number of nonlinear effects including decay and modulational instabilities , which are described by the zakharov equations  @xcite .",
    "the zakharov equations in a quantum plasma ( which we hereby call the quantum - corrected zakharov equations ) were recently obtained in the electrostatic approximation using the wigner kinetic approach for the electron quantum distribution function  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that in quantum plasma , the classical zakharov equations are modified by quantum correction terms proportional to @xmath0 ( note that in the formal classical limit @xmath1 , the quantum - corrected zakharov equations obtained in  @xcite reduce to the classical zakharov equations  @xcite ) .",
    "nonlinear waves in quantum plasmas are not yet sufficiently well understood .",
    "for example , the classical zakharov equations in the adiabatic limit reduce to the nonlinear schrodinger ( nls ) equation which is completely integrable via the ist ( inverse scattering transform ) method , but no such technique seems to be easily constructable in the quantum case .    in terms of the variational formulation of quantum - modified nls equation , haas et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the coefficients of soliton solution in quantum - corrected form ( when @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a constant speed at which the soliton solution propagates ) . in the present work",
    ", we will focus on the soliton solution of the quantum - corrected zakharov equations which propagates with constant speed @xmath3 .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate the role played by quantum effects in the quantum - corrected zakharov system ; these effects modify the dispersion - nonlinearity equilibrium , which is the ultimate factor responsible for the existence of solitons .    in this paper , we investigate the previously obtained quantum - corrected zakharov equations relevant to quantum plasmas , and obtain their quantum - corrected soliton solutions , comparing them with those in the case of the classical zakharov model .",
    "in the previous work  @xcite , we have generalized the formalism of modulational interactions to nonrelativistic quantum plasmas , based on the wigner kinetic description of collisionless quantum plasmas .",
    "in particular , we derived kinetically the effective cubic response of a quantum plasma ( which in general is a complex - valued function ) , which can be used for various modulational processes .",
    "we derived the quantum - corrected zakharov equations for collisionless quantum plasmas by neglecting the imaginary part of the effective cubic response .",
    "the resulting quantum - corrected zakharov equations describe the coupled nonlinear evolution of high - frequency fields and low - frequency density perturbations in collisionless quantum plasmas that can be written in the one dimensional case as @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the envelope of the langmuir wave packet modulated by the nonlinear interaction with plasma density variations , @xmath7 is the plasma density variations from its equilibrium value @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the electron plasma frequency ( i.e. @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron and ion masses , respectively , @xmath13 is the electrons thermal velocity and @xmath14 is the ion sound velocity , and @xmath15 is the reduced planck constant .    upon introducing the dimensionless variables @xmath16 the corresponding dimensionless zakharov equations in quantum plasma can be presented in the form @xmath17 @xmath18 where the quantum parameter @xmath19 is given in eq .",

    "i. e. @xmath26 ) particularly in astrophysical plasmas , quantum effects in the coupling between langmuir and ion - acoustic modes become important  @xcite .",
    "if we ignore the quantum correction by setting @xmath27 , we simply obtain the classical zakharov equations  @xcite . at the classical level ,",
    "a set of coupled nonlinear wave equations describing the interaction between high - frequency langmuir waves with low frequency plasma density variations was first derived by zakharov  @xcite . for the classical model",
    ", one can find many kinds of solitons by various methods  @xcite . in the quantum case ,",
    "the analysis of existence of localized or soliton solutions is much more difficult .",
    "the basic difficulty follows from the fact that the new , quantum - corrected equations constitute a more complicated system of coupled , fourth - order nonlinear equations  ( [ q4])-([q5 ] ) .    in the adiabatic limit , by setting @xmath28=0 $ ] in eq .",

    "the envelope of the electric field satisfies a nonlinear schrodinger equation , which is completely integrable yielding n - soliton solutions  @xcite .",
    "solitons usually arise as a consequence of the detailed balance between dispersive and nonlinear contributions .",
    "the quantum effects may perturb or perhaps even destroy these localized solitonic solutions . since quantum effects enhance dispersion , one should expect that quantum solitons will not be so easily found for the quantum zakharov equations as for the classical case  @xcite .",
