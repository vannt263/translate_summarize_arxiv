    "future neutrino oscillation facilities are primarily targeted towards the discovery of a non - zero @xmath1 , the neutrino mass hierarchy determination , and the measurement of leptonic cp violation .",
    "all of these measurements depend heavily on the magnitude of @xmath1 .",
    "two examples for experiments under way , which will test the magnitude of @xmath1 , are the t2k superbeam ( sb ) project  @xcite and the double chooz reactor experiment  @xcite . from all such neutrino oscillation experiments",
    ", one may expect a @xmath1 sensitivity limit of about @xmath2 in a decade from now ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath1 can either be constrained to be smaller than this value , or it will be discovered until then . since the discovery of @xmath1 affects the experimental strategy how to measure the mass hierarchy and cp violation , this `` branching point ''  @xcite will , at the latest , tell us how to proceed .",
    "if @xmath1 turns out to be small , one may optimize for a maximum @xmath1 reach of all measurements .",
    "it seems that a neutrino factory  @xcite ( nf ) or a higher gamma beta beam  @xcite could be the most promising alternative ; for the optimization discussions , see , _ e.g. _ , refs .  @xcite . for large @xmath1 ,",
    "the measurement far away from the oscillation maximum and matter density uncertainties affect the nf performance  @xcite .",
    "therefore , other alternatives may outperform a nf , such as sb upgrades or beta beams ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite for a direct comparison ) .    recently , potential improvements in the muon charge identification ( cid ) at low energies ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) have brought back a nf into the discussion for large @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a muon energy of @xmath3 was proposed at baselines of @xmath4 to @xmath5 , an option similar to a wide band beam in terms of neutrino energies and baseline .",
    "the relatively low muon energy allows for a significant reduction of the effort on the accelerator side , which means that this option might indeed be competitive to sb upgrades , _",
    "etc._. other alternatives to improve the nf for large @xmath1 are the use of the magic baseline  @xcite , or the platinum channel @xmath6 ( with the @xmath7 s coming from the muon decays ) , which requires electron detection with cid  @xcite . in this way",
    ", the impact of matter density uncertainties can be significantly reduced as well .    in this letter",
    ", we discuss the optimization of a low - energy nf .",
    "we compare such an optimized experiment to wide band beams and beta beams .",
    "furthermore , we propose to use the neutrinos from the secondary pion / kaon beam in addition to the nf beam .",
    "this sb , possibly targeted towards the same detector , will provide similar information to the platinum channel .",
    "however , it has two major advantages : first , the ( at least in a magnetized iron calorimeter ) very difficult electron cid is not required if operated out - of - phase with the nf beam .",
    "second , the proton energy can be chosen such that the event rates are peaking at lower energies , where the nf has less events . we discuss the requirements for such a hybrid configuration , which we call `` neutrino factory superbeam '' ( nf - sb ) , and we show the physics potential .",
    "the primary information from a nf comes from the `` golden '' @xmath8 appearance channel  @xcite .",
    "the two major challenges for large @xmath1 are the matter density uncertainties and the lack of events at low energies , where the interesting higher - order oscillation effects are present . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , complementary information from the t - conjugated @xmath6 appearance channel ( platinum channel ) would help , partly because of the correlated matter effect .",
    "however , cid for electrons in a magnetized iron calorimeter appears to be difficult because the electrons produce showers early ( though it may not be impossible for low neutrino energies ) . in this letter",
    ", we propose to use the sb from the pion and kaon decays instead of the platinum channel .",
    "the schematics for such a setup can be found in figure  [ fig : schematics ] .",
    "we require that it be operated out - of - phase with the nf beam , which means that cid will not be required for this channel .",
    "in addition , the proton energy can be adjusted within the range acceptable for the nf ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "such that a spectrum peaking at lower energies can be obtained .",
    "as one can see from figure  [ fig : schematics ] , there are two major requirements for such a setup : first , the geometry has to be chosen such that the tertiary and quarternary neutrino beams point towards the same detector ( not to scale ) .",
    "second , the target station has to be able to separate and focus the pion and kaon charges in a way that both experiments can be operated simultaneously . from figure  [",
    "fig : schematics ] , this requirement may be acceptable if we only use half of the luminosity of an exclusive nf ( because only one polarity can be operated at the same time ) . however , one may speculate that a more sophisticated target station might recycle a fraction of the muons from the sb mode .",
    "note that , for the nf plus sb , we have now three phenomenological degrees of freedom : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the main prerequisite for a low - energy nf is an improved detection system with sufficient golden channel efficiencies at low energies .",
    "these efficiencies with a threshold possibly as low as @xmath12 might be obtained by cuts leading to a higher charge mis - identification background , or a more refined detector than a magnetized iron calorimeter ( such as a no@xmath13a - like detector or a liquid argon detector with a large magnetic volume ) .",
    "for large @xmath1 , such a background will not be very important as long as the background level is @xmath14 .",
    "we follow refs .",
    "@xcite by using a low - threshold ( @xmath15 ) with improved energy resolution option ( @xmath16 ) , which we call golden*. we us 50% efficiency for the golden channel requiring cid , and 90% efficiency for the disappearance channel without cid .",
    "note that an even higher appearance efficiency may be obtained for the price of larger backgrounds .",
    "we use a total luminosity of @xmath17 running time @xmath18 @xmath19 useful muon decays / year @xmath18 @xmath20 detector mass in each polarity ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 stored ) if operated as nf alone , and half of that for the nf - sb .",
    "we assume that the number of useful muon decays / year approximately requires a target power of @xmath23 , but this number scales with non - trivial aspects of the muon cooling and acceleration system . for the comparison to the platinum channel",
    ", we again follow the optimistic choice in ref .  @xcite using 40% efficiency , no upper threshold , and 1% charge mis - identification ( _ cf .",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite for liquid argon ) .    for the sb operation",
    ", we have tested a miniboone - like wide band beam ( @xmath24 ) and an ags - like wide band beam ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "since the miniboone - like beam has turned out too have too low neutrino energies for our application , we focus on the ags - like beam in the following ( see refs .  @xcite for details on the simulation ) .",
    "note that a considerably higher proton energy may lead to a significant loss of efficiency for the nf .",
    "we assume an electron detection efficiency of 80% without cid ( in golden * ) and that the experiments is subject to the same nc background as the muons .",
    "this assumption is probably too optimistic , but the intrinsic beam background is larger anyway .",
    "our systematical errors are chosen to be 5% except for the signal normalization errors in the nf ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "appearance event rates as a function of the reconstructed neutrino energy .",
    "the figures compare the nf ( golden ) , sb , and platinum channel appearance .",
    "the curves are computed for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 useful muon decays , and @xmath34 . ]",
    "we compare in figure  [ fig : rates ] the event rate spectra from the three potentially used appearance channels ( nf , sb , platinum ) . the peak of the platinum channel is at higher energies than the peak of the nf because of the corresponding spectra from the muon decays ( the electron neutrinos peak at lower energies than the muon neutrinos ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath9 is chosen such that the sb peaks at lower energies , where oscillation effects are more prominent ( _ cf .",
    "_ , right panel ) .",
    "note that this figure assumes the muon decay numbers of the nf - sb , whereas an exclusive nf operation will allow for the double luminosity .        for the simulation",
    ", we use the globes software  @xcite . for the oscillation parameters , we use @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and a normal mass hierarchy unless stated otherwise ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the matter density will be known at the level of 5% .",
    "as far as the optimizations of a low - energy nf and the nf - sb are concerned , let us first of all focus on the nf alone . in figure",
    "[ fig : optcomp ] , left panel , we show the fraction of ( true ) @xmath42 for which cp violation can be measured as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath10 ( for @xmath30 ) . at the optimum ( diamond ) , one can establish cp violation for 81% of all possible values of @xmath42 .",
    "one has close - to - optimum performance for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which is consistent with the configuration discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the mass hierarchy , we find that @xmath45 to establish the mass hierarchy for any @xmath42 ( the @xmath10-dependence is moderate ) .",
    "in addition , note that for such a large @xmath1 , none of the discussed facilities has a problem to establish a non - zero @xmath1 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : optcomp ] , right panel , we show the same optimization for nf - sb with a fixed proton energy of @xmath25 and half the useful number of muon decays from the last example . at the optimum ( diamond ) , one can establish cp violation for 85% of all possible values of @xmath42 .",
    "the optimal baseline range depends on @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , one has close - to - optimum performance for @xmath46 for @xmath44 . for the mass hierarchy , shorter baselines @xmath47 are , in principle , sufficient .",
    "this effect has been discussed in ref .",
    "since the nf luminosity in this hybrid is only half of the one for the nf alone , we conclude that we have a identified a synergy between the nf and the sb which goes beyond the simple addition of statistics ( for a definition of synergy , see ref .",
    "note that the sb alone operated at double luminosity approximately compares to the low - energy nf alone ( for @xmath30 and the same detector ) .",
    "two - baseline optimization of the nf plus sb with uncorrelated matter effect : fraction of @xmath42 for which cp violation can be discovered as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the muon energy is @xmath51 , and @xmath30 . ]",
    "now one may argue that it may be better to use a combination with two different baselines in the fashion of ref .",
    "@xcite ( nf plus sb ) .",
    "therefore , we show in figure  [ fig : twobase ] the two - baseline optimization of the nf and sb with uncorrelated matter effect and a fixed muon energy of @xmath51 .",
    "the optimum turns out to be close to the same - baseline diagonal .",
    "however , it is somewhat worse than for the correlated matter density case above . since a option requiring only one site and , possibly",
    ", only one detector is much more cost efficient , we will not discuss the two - baseline case anymore .",
    "we have , in addition , tested a @xmath52 water cherenkov detector for the sb part together with the @xmath20 golden*. more or less , we obtain the same qualitative results with the difference of a much higher fraction of @xmath42 : cp violation can be measured for about @xmath53 of all values of @xmath42 ( for @xmath30 ) . of course , this option would require an additional very large detector .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that our optimization results to not change for somewhat smaller @xmath54 . in the following section , we will use these standard setups from the optimization discussion above as given in table  [ tab : setups ] .",

    "obviously , the nf - sb outperforms any of the chosen facilities for large enough @xmath1 except for the beta beam .",
    "in particular , it is significantly better than low - e nf ( with or without platinum channel ) , and slightly better than high - e nf@xmath60 ( except for @xmath70 ) . note that these setups are operated at the double muon decay rate compared to the nf - sb , which means that the information from nf and sb is very complementary in terms of channel and spectrum .",
    "as far as the beta beam is concerned , we find that it has the best absolute performance . however , given the relatively high gamma and the challenging ion decay rates , it is difficult to judge how this setup compares in terms of feasibility and effort .",
    "the comparison to the wide band beam ( in this case with a @xmath52 water cherenkov detector compared to the @xmath20 golden * used for the nf - sb hybrid ) depends very much on @xmath1 : for very large @xmath71 , the wide band beam might be the natural choice , because it is based on known technology .",
    "however , for a somewhat smaller @xmath1 , the nf - sb is significantly better .",
    "we have also studied further potential improvements of the nf - sb .",
    "very little physics reach can be gained by the additional use of the magic baseline or platinum channel , or by better knowledge on the matter density profile , since the underlying correlations are already resolved .",
    "the most significant improvement can be obtained by luminosity upgrades , such as by using a large water cherenkov detector ( for the sb ) in addition to golden * at the same site . in this case",
    ", even the beta beam can be outperformed for very large @xmath1 .",
    "note that one could imagine different staged scenarios with this observation , such as wbb@xmath72 followed by nf - sb .",
    "we expect that further significant improvements could be obtained by better absolute efficiencies for the muon neutrino appearance channel ( for the price of larger backgrounds ) , by recycling a fraction of the muons produced in the sb channel for the nf , or by a further optimization of proton energy and horn characterizing the sb .",
    "we have studied a low - energy neutrino factory ( nf ) in combination with a superbeam ( sb ) produced in the decay chain of the same protons , which we have called `` neutrino factory superbeam '' .",
    "we have demonstrated that this configuration outperforms a low - energy nf alone beyond a simple addition of statistics even if one can use the platinum channel , as well as it outperforms a wide band beam with the same proton energy .",
    "the reason for this excellent performance is the sb spectrum peaking at lower energies , and the information from the t - conjugated @xmath6 channel at the same baseline ( _ i.e. _ , with correlated matter effect ) .",
    "as far as the technical requirements for such a configuration are concerned , the same detector might be used at the same baseline . as for any low - energy neutrino factory , sufficiently good efficiencies at low energies are required .",
    "the extra effort mainly reduces to a more sophisticated target station , which has to separate the pion and kaon charges and utilize them for the nf and sb . in addition",
    ", we have assumed that the nf and sb bunches arrive out - of - phase at the ( possibly same ) detector .",
    "for the electron neutrino detection , we have required a relatively high efficiency without cid , which is different from the platinum channel ( where the requirement of cid significantly reduces the efficiency ) .",
    "as far as systematics is concerned , we expect this experiment to be of low risk : the nf systematics has been assumed very conservatively , and the wide band beam is rather robust with respect to systematics  @xcite .",
    "this might be an important decision criterion in comparison to narrow band beams .    from the optimization",
    ", we have found @xmath46 and @xmath44 to be close - to - optional , which , for instance , corresponds to fermilab to homestake or henderson . for the proton energy ,",
    "we have tested two configurations at the lower end upper end of the admissible range for a nf , and we have chosen @xmath73 .",
    "this means that we obtain a completely different configuration from a high - energy nf optimized for small @xmath1  @xcite in terms of baselines , muon energy , and target station . for the detector ,",
    "the need for high efficiencies at low energies is independent of the nf configuration ( but not a prerequisite for a high - energy nf ) .",
    "however , higher backgrounds may be admissible for the low - energy nf , which means that the overall efficiency could be higher .",
    "although a high - energy nf with two baselines ( and possibly platinum channel ) might be used for large @xmath1 as well , the effort might be considerably higher .",
    "the same , in principle , applies to a higher gamma beta beam .",
    "we conclude that a reasonable decision can be made when the branching point sensitivity @xmath74 is reached .",
    "before that point , one may want to develop two different nf approaches : one optimized for @xmath1 reach operated as a discovery machine , the other optimized for large @xmath1 operated as a precision instrument .",
