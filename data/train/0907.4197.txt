    "the present baryon asymmetry in the universe is one of the most mysterious problems in cosmology and particle physics , see a review @xcite . within the standard model ( sm ) , the electroweak baryogenesis",
    "was suggested to explain the inequality between baryon and anti - baryon number , and the recent developments are shifted into constructing the theory of reheating the universe @xcite .",
    "the electroweak baryogenesis satisfies the well - known sakharov s three conditions required for successful baryogenesis @xcite , namely baryon number production , charge parity ( cp ) violation and the process taking place out - of - equilibrium ; however , the predicted cp violation is too small to explain the present observed baryon number . by satisfying the above three conditions , the affleck - dine ( ad ) baryogenesis @xcite , which was proposed in the theoretical framework beyond the sm , namely , the minimal super - symmetric standard model ( mssm ) , is a more successful scenario to tackle this puzzle , since it may solve problems of gravitino and moduli overproduction and give rise simultaneously to the ordinary matter and dark mater in the universe .",
    "the mssm has many gauge - invariant flat directions along which r parity is preserved .",
    "the flat directions are lifted by super - symmetry ( susy ) breaking effects arising from nonrenormalisable terms , which give a u(1 ) violation through a - terms . in the original scenario of the ad baryogenesis , one can parametrise one of the flat directions in terms of a complex scalar field known as an ad field ( or ad condensate which consists of a combination of squarks and/or sleptons fields )",
    ". the ad field evolves to a large field expectation value during an inflationary epoch in the early universe .",
    "after inflation , the orbit of the ad field can be kicked along the phase direction due to the a - terms which generate the u(1 ) charge ( baryon / lepton number ) , and then the a - terms become negligible , where the ad field rotate towards the global minimum of the scalar potential .",
    "hence , the generated global u(1 ) charge is fixed and the orbit of the ad field rotates around the origin of the complex field - space , _ c.  f. _ the anomaly mediated models @xcite . after the ad condensate decays into usual baryons and leptons",
    ", ad baryogenesis becomes complete .",
    "the trajectory of the ad field is identical to the planetary orbits in the well - known kepler - problem as we will show later , replacing the newtonian potential by an isotropic harmonic oscillator potential @xcite .",
    "this coincidental classical - mechanics reduction was noted for the orbits of a probe brane in the branonium system @xcite . as general relativity predicted that planetary orbits precess by adding the relativistic correction to the newtonian potential , we will see the similar events occur for the orbits of ad fields , which are disturbed by quantum and nonrenormalisable effects .    by including quantum corrections @xcite and/or thermal effects @xcite in the mass term of the standard ad scalar potentials ,",
    "the ad condensate is classically unstable against spatial perturbations due to the presence of negative pressure @xcite , and fragments to bubble - like objects , eventually evolving into @xmath0-balls @xcite .",
    "lee pointed out @xcite that @xmath0-balls may form due to bubble nucleation ( first order phase transition ) @xcite , even in the case that the condensate is classically stable against the linear spatial perturbations .",
    "a @xmath0-ball is a nontopological soliton @xcite whose stability comes from the existence of a continuous global or local charge @xmath0 ( see a review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "tsumagari _ et .",
    "@xcite showed previously the complete stability analysis of @xmath0-balls at zero - temperature in both polynomial potentials and mssm flat potentials .",
    "@xcite investigated the stability of @xmath0-balls in a thermal bath .",
    "the stability of the thermal susy @xmath0-balls is different from the one of the standard `` cold '' @xmath0-balls , since they suffer from evaporation @xcite , diffusion @xcite , dissociation @xcite , and decays into light / massless fermions @xcite .",
    "therefore , most susy @xmath0-balls are generally not stable but long - lived , and it may thermalise the universe by decaying into baryons on their surface @xcite , which could solve the gravitino and moduli over - production problems without fine - tuning .",
    "the susy @xmath0-balls in gravity - mediated ( grv - m ) models are quasi - stable decaying into the lightest susy particles ( lsp dark matter ) , and the fraction of the baryons from the @xmath0-balls may give the present baryon number , which can explain the similarity of the energy density between the observed baryons and dark matter @xcite .",
    "the susy @xmath0-balls in gauge - mediated ( gau - m ) models , however , can be extremely long - lived so that those @xmath0-balls are a candidate of cold dark matter @xcite and may give the present observed baryo - to - photon ratio @xcite .",
    "the dynamics and formation of @xmath0-balls have been investigated numerically . with different relative phases and initial velocities , the authors @xcite found a charge transfer from one @xmath0-ball to the other and interesting ring formation after the collision .",
    "it has been found @xcite that similar ring - like solutions are responsible for the excited states from the ground state ( @xmath0-ball ) by introducing extra degrees of freedom : spatial spins @xcite and twists @xcite .",
    "the formation of @xmath0-balls after inflation have been extensively investigated in both grv - m models @xcite and gau - m models @xcite , in which susy is broken by either gravity or gauge interactions .",
    "as we will show , the @xmath0-ball formation involves a nonequilibrium dynamics which is related to reheating problem in cosmology .    the reheating process after the inflation period involves nonlinear , out - of - equilibrium , and nonperturbative phenomena so that it is extremely hard to construct a theory for the whole process , see the 2 particle irreducible effective action as a remarkable approach @xcite . in the first stage of reheating ( _ preheating _ ) , it is currently well known that the fluctuations at low momenta are amplified , which leads to explosive particle production .",
    "after preheating , the subsequent stages towards equilibrium are described by the wave kinetic theory of turbulence ; micha _ et .",
    "_ @xcite recently estimated the reheating time and temperaute .",
    "these turbulent regimes appear in a large variety of nonequilibrium process , and indeed , the evolution of @xmath0-ball formation experiences the active turbulence at which stage , many bubbles collide as observed in the next stage of tachyonic preheating @xcite . during this bubble - collision stage within the reheating scenario ,",
    "it is believed that gravitational waves may be emitted from the stochastic motion of heavy objects @xcite .",
    "the problem of gravitational wave emissions has been discussed only in the fragmentation stage of @xmath0-ball formation so far @xcite , but not in the collision stage as opposed to the preheating cases .    in this paper , we show analytically and numerically that in grv - m and gau - m models the approximate trajectory of the ad fields is , respectively , precessing spiral or shrinking trefoil due to the quantum , nonrenormalisable , and the hubble expansion effects .",
    "moreover , we explicitly present the exponential growth of the linear spatial perturbations in both models . by introducing @xmath1 ( and @xmath2)-dimensional lattice simulations",
    ", we identify that the evolution in @xmath0-ball formation involves nonequilibrium dynamics , including turbulent stages . following the pioneering work on the turbulent thermalisation by micha _ et .",
    "@xcite , we obtain scaling laws for the evolution of variances during the @xmath0-ball formation .",

    "two appendices are included .",
    "we obtain the equations of motion and their perturbed equations for multiple scalar fields in appendix [ multi ] . in appendix",
    "[ app2 ] , we find elliptic forms for the orbits of ad fields .",
    "in this section , we investigate the equation for the orbit of an ad condensate .",
    "this orbit coincides with the well - known orbit equation in the centre force problem in classical dynamics , i.e. planetary motions so that we call the ad condensate `` ad planet '' sometimes . for the bound orbits , the effective potential should satisfy the condition where the curvature at the minimum of the effective potentials should be positive . in the presence of hubble expansion ,",
    "the effective potential depends on time ; thus , the full solution of the orbit equations can be obtained numerically except the case that the ad field is trapped by a quadratic potential . in appendix",
    "[ app2 ] , we obtain the exact orbit in this exceptional case when hubble expansion is assumed to be small and adiabatic . the orbit of the ad planet , or more precisely an eccentricity of the elliptic motion in the complex field - space , is determined by the initial charge and energy density . in order to obtain analytic expressions of the orbit in more general potential cases in which we are more interested , we restrict ourself to work in minkowski spacetime and on the orbit which should be nearly circular . in appendix",
    "[ app2 ] , we also obtain the perturbed orbit equation and necessary conditions for closed orbits where the orbits come back to their original positions after some rotations around the minimum of the effective potential . in bertrand",
    "s theorem @xcite , there are only two potential forms allowed to be closed orbits : isotropic harmonic force and the inverse - squared force .",
    "each of the central forces gives dynamical symmetries , namely fradkin tensor @xcite and runge - lenz vector @xcite , respectively .",
    "these dynamical charges are obtained both classically by the algebra of poisson bracket @xcite and quantum - mechanically by the corresponding lie algebra in the abelian case @xcite as well as nonabelian case @xcite . by approximating phenomenologically motivated models that appear in the mssm and using the results in appendix [ app2 ] , we present , in this section , analytic motions of the nearly circular orbits and the pressure of the ad planets .",
    "further , we check these analytic results with full numerical solutions .",
    "let us consider a motion of ad fields in an expanding universe with scale factor @xmath3 and hubble parameter @xmath4 , where a over - dot denotes the time derivative .",
    "we investigate the ad field after they start to rotate around the origin of the effective potentials and the value of the u(1 ) charge @xmath5 is fixed due to negligible contributions from a - terms . by decomposing the complex ( ad ) field",
    "@xmath6 as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real scalar fields , the equations of motion for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( see in appendix [ multi ] ) are + 3h+&=&0 , + [ phshomo]+3h+&= & 0=0 , where the conserved comoving charge density is defined by @xmath12 , and the effective potentials are @xmath13 .",

    "the models shown in will be used later .    given an initial charge and energy density ( or equivalently initial momenta and positions ) , the ad field oscillates around the value @xmath19 , which is defined by .|__cr=0 , where the orbit becomes circular when it starts from there , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "this orbit is bounded when the curvature is positive w^2.|__cr>0 .",
    "for example , given a power - law potential such that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a coupling constant and @xmath23 is real and a power of the homogeneous field @xmath8 , the condition given by implies that bound orbits exist for @xmath24 if @xmath25 and for @xmath26 if @xmath27 , where we used .",
    "another example is the case that a scalar potential is logarithmic , i.e. @xmath28 where the coupling constant @xmath29 is positive . in this case , is automatically satisfied .",
    "we investigate these two cases in more detail in appendix [ app2 ] .",
    "let us rescale the field @xmath10 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the value of @xmath3 at an initial time .",
    "it follows that the equations of motion in are --+^3=0 , = 0 , where we defined @xmath32 , and the terms involving @xmath33 and @xmath34 are negligible under the assumption of an adiabatic hubble expansion , i.e. @xmath35 .    by introducing a new variable , @xmath36 , and using the second expression in , the first expression in becomes the well - known orbit equation in the centre force problem such that + = -^3j(,t ) .",
    "notice that @xmath37 depends on time caused by the hubble expansion , whereas the time - dependence in @xmath38 vanishes when the potential @xmath39 is given by a quadratic mass term , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a mass of the ad field , @xmath6 .",

    "also , @xmath45 is a coupling constant for the nonrenormalisable term , which is suppressed by a high energy scale , e.g. the planck scale @xmath46 gev . here , @xmath47 is a factor from the gaugino - loop correction , whose value is typically @xmath48 $ ] when the flat direction does not have a large top quark component @xcite ; thus , we concentrate on the case of @xmath49 from now on .",
    "the power @xmath50 of the nonrenormalisable term depends on flat directions . as examles of the directions involving squarks ,",
    "the @xmath51 direction has @xmath52 , whilst the @xmath53 direction is @xmath54 . for @xmath55 , the first two terms in can be approximated by @xmath56 , we then find that v()^l+^n n > l which we call model a , where we set @xmath57 and @xmath41 has a mass - dimension , @xmath58 , since @xmath59 for @xmath55 . for small values of @xmath8",
    ", we confirm that the power @xmath23 is not approximately @xmath60 , so we will find a value of @xmath23 numerically in that case later .    in another scenario in which susy is broken by gauge integration , so - called , gauge - mediated ( gau - m ) model , the scalar potential has the curvature with the electroweak mass at a low energy scale , whilst it grows logarithmically at the high energy scale ( which means that the potential is nearly flat as similar as the case of @xmath61 in ) .",

    "we , thus , set @xmath65 for later convenience .",
    "then , the scalar potential at high energy scale is approximately given by @xcite vm^4 _",
    "what follows is that we assume the orbit of the ad condensate is determined by the high energy scale where @xmath66 , calling this case , , model b.    using the results in appendix [ app2 ] , we obtain the following quantities , @xmath67 and @xmath68 by assuming that the dominant contribution in model a and b is , respectively , either power - law term or logarithmic term , each of which corresponds to the first term in , respectively . here",

    "the sub - dominant terms ( nonrenormalisable terms ) perturb the orbits by introducing infinitesimally small quantities @xmath70 where the subscripts correspond to the names of models introduced above .",
    "thus , the main contributions are either or .      by recalling , we obtain the following relations for @xmath72 : w^2= , where we defined a positive parameter , @xmath73 , which is assumed to be infinitesimally small .",

    "the orbits for @xmath76 are nearly closed , but it is perturbed by the nonrenormalisable term involved with @xmath77 .",
    "it results in that the periapsis appears to precess where the precession rate can be obtained from .",
    "the reader should notice that the denominator of the term involving @xmath77 in the second expression of has @xmath78 , which implies that it would be possible to have the non - negligible contribution from the term , even though @xmath79 .",

    "the orbits are not closed and it should look like trefoil , see .    in an expanding universe ,",
    "the above orbits for model a and b suffer from the hubble damping so that the orbits are naively expected to be precessing spiral or shrinking trefoil in the field space , respectively .      in this subsection , we present numerical results to check the analytic results which we found in the previous subsection . to do so",

    "since @xmath431 , implies that @xmath432 . by expanding @xmath433 around @xmath434 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath435 , where we are evaluating the differentiations at @xmath425 .",
