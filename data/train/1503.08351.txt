    "a _ factorization _ of an element @xmath0 of a cancellative commutative semigroup @xmath1 is an expression of @xmath0 as a sum of irreducible elements of @xmath2 , and a _ factorization invariant _ is a quantity assigned to each element of @xmath2 ( or to @xmath2 as a whole ) that measures the failure of its factorizations to be unique .",
    "factorization invariants are often combinatorial in nature , and provide concrete methods of quantifying the abundance and variety of factorizations .",
    "for instance , one may consider the number of distinct factorizations of an element @xmath3 , or the maximum number of irreducible elements appearing in a single factorization of @xmath0 .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough introduction .",
    "several recent results examine the asymptotic behavior of factorization invariants in the setting of numerical semigroups ( additive , cofinite subsemigroups of @xmath4 ) .",
    "for example , the delta set ( definition  [ d : deltaset ] ) and catenary degree ( definition  [ d : catenary ] ) invariants , which measure the `` spread '' of a given element s nonunique factorizations , are each eventually periodic over any numerical semigroup @xcite .",
    "additionally , the @xmath5-primality invariant ( definition  [ d : omega ] ) , which assigns a positive integer to each semigroup element measuring how far from prime that element is , coincides with a linear function with periodic coeffients for sufficiently large elements in any numerical semigroup @xcite . see the survey  @xcite and the references therein for more detail on this setting .",
    "the primary goals of this paper are to ( i ) generalize each result in the previous paragraph to the setting of finitely generated semigroups using techniques from combinatorial commutative algebra , and in doing so , ( ii ) provide a new framework through which to study these invariants . given a finitely generated , reduced , cancellative commutative semigroup @xmath2 , we construct , for each factorization invariant discussed above , a family of multigraded modules whose hilbert functions ( definition  [ d : hilbert ] ) determine the value of the invariant in question for any element of @xmath2 . applying hilbert s theorem ( theorems  [ t : hilbert ] and  [ t : hilbert2 ] ) to each family of modules classifies the eventual behavior of the corresponding factorization invariant in @xmath2 ( theorems  [ t : deltahilbert ] , [ t : omegahilbert ] , and  [ t : catenaryhilbert ] ) . in the special case where @xmath6 is a numerical semigroup , each classification specializes to a result from the previous paragraph ( corollaries  [ c : deltanumerical ] , [ c : omeganumerical ] and  [ c : catenarynumerical ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the semigroup - theoretic arguments originally used for numerical semigroups , the arguments presented here lie squarely in the realm of combinatorial commutative algebra . as such",
    ", our approach provides new theoretical tools with which to study factorization invariants in this setting .",
    "this includes several classes of semigroups of interest in factorization theory , such as cohen - kaplansky domains ( integral domains with finitely many irreducible elements ) , which are of interest in algebraic number theory  @xcite , and block monoids , which are central to additive combinatorics  @xcite . in  fact , questions arising in algebraic number theory motivated the initial study the @xmath5-primality invariant  @xcite . additionally , in the setting of affine semigroups ( finitely generated subsemigroups of  @xmath7 ) , several invariants discussed in this paper are of interest outside of factorization theory .",
    "indeed , factorizations of an affine semigroup element coincide with integer solutions to a system of linear diophantine equations . from this viewpoint ,",
    "delta sets of affine semigroup elements are closely related to questions of lattice width @xcite , and catenary degree computations encapsulate data related to @xmath8-distances between integer solutions  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : hilbert ] , we review hilbert s theorem , both for @xmath4-graded modules ( theorem  [ t : hilbert ] ) and multigraded modules ( theorem  [ t : hilbert2 ] ) .",
    "we also review multivariate quasipolynomial functions , including several equivalent definitions ( theorem  [ t : affineequiv ] ) .",
    "the remaining sections of the paper consider different factorization invariants for finitely generated semigroups , including the number of distinct factorizations ( section  [ s : factorizations ] ) , the delta set ( section  [ s : delta ] ) , @xmath5-primality ( section  [ s : omega ] ) , and the catenary degree ( section  [ s : catenary ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate how the value of each invariant can be recovered from hilbert functions , and examine consequences both for finitely generated semigroups and for numerical semigroups .",

    "<S> nonunique factorization in cancellative commutative semigroups is often studied using combinatorial factorization invariants , which assign to each semigroup element a quantity determined by the factorization structure . for numerical semigroups ( additive subsemigroups of the natural numbers ) , </S>",
    "<S> several factorization invariants are known to admit predictable behavior for sufficiently large semigroup elements . in particular , the catenary degree and delta set invariants are both eventually periodic , and the omega - primality invariant is eventually quasilinear . in this paper , we demonstrate how each of these invariants is determined by hilbert functions of graded modules . in doing so , we extend each of the aforementioned eventual behavior results to finitely generated semigroups , and provide a new framework through which to study factorization structures in this setting . </S>"
