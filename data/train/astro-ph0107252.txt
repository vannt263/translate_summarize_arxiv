    "the surf reduction routines arbitrarily normalize all the data maps in a reduction sequence to the central pixel of the first map ; thus , the noise levels in a combined image are determined relative to the quality of the central pixel in the first map . in order to determine the absolute noise levels of our maps , we first eliminated the @xmath18 real sources in each field by subtracting an appropriately normalized version of the beam profile .",

    "in order to test the significance of our results , we repeated our submillimeter measurement procedure for a large number of simulations . in the simulations we offset the x - ray sample a random amount in the ra and dec directions and then measured the submillimeter fluxes at these random positions .",
    "the average flux per source at these random positions was found to be accurately zero , but the dispersion from field to field was found to be 0.27  mjy rather than the nominal 0.16  mjy , suggesting the presence of some systematic error .",
    "we use this larger uncertainty subsequently .",
    "the 95 percent confidence level is 0.45  mjy , and the 98 percent confidence level is 0.6  mjy , leaving little doubt that there is a significant excess 850  @xmath0 m flux associated with the x - ray sample .",
    "similarly , the random samples have an average of 1.2 @xmath21 sources per field and 95 and 98 percent confidence levels of 4 and 5 sources , respectively , so most of the significantly detected submillimeter sources are real .",
    "the resolution of the fir / submillimeter extragalactic background light ( ebl ) by the dirbe and firas experiments on _ cobe _ revealed that the fir / submillimeter ebl has approximately the same integrated energy density as the optical ebl .",
    "thus , the absorption and reradiation of light by dust in the history of galaxy formation and evolution is extremely important ; however , in order to reconstruct the star formation and accretion histories of the universe , we need to be able to differentiate between the fir / submillimeter contributions made by starbursts and those made by agn .    about @xmath28 percent of the 850  @xmath0 m ebl has been resolved into discrete sources by blank field scuba surveys ( e.g. , barger , cowie , & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "blain et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated from a scuba survey of massive cluster lenses which amplify distant submillimeter sources that more than 80 percent of the 850  @xmath0 m ebl is now resolved .",
    "the ultraluminous scuba sources are believed to be the high redshift analogs of the local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , but there is an ongoing debate even as to whether the local uligs are dominantly powered by star formation or by agn activity .",
    "modelling suggests that @xmath29 percent of the fir / submillimeter ebl may be contributed by galaxies containing bright agn ( almaini , lawrence , & boyle 1999 ; gunn & shanks 2001 ) .",
    "it is difficult to spectroscopically look for agn signatures in the scuba sources  though in a few cases such signatures have been detected ( e.g. , ivison et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al .  1999 )  due to the extremely faint nature of the vast majority of the optical counterparts .",
    "however , since most of the flux density from the _ chandra _ x - ray sample is expected to arise from agn activity , we may use the present data to place an upper limit on the agn contribution to the 850  @xmath0 m ebl .",
    "( a submillimeter source detected in x - rays is not necessarily solely powered by accretion onto the agn , as there may also be dust obscured starburst activity in the galaxy which contributes to the submillimeter flux . )",
    "barger et al .  ( 2001a ) multiplied the hard xrb measurement from vecchi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) by the ratio of the total 850  @xmath0 m flux to the total hard x - ray flux of the ssa13 hard x - ray sample to estimate the hard x - ray contribution to the 850  @xmath0 m ebl .",
    "they determined the contribution to be about 10 percent .",
    "however , their approach assumed that a fixed submillimeter to x - ray flux ratio applies to all of the x - ray sources .",
    "we can quantitatively see that this is not a good assumption from table  [ tab1 ] , where we list the average x - ray flux and the average submillimeter flux and uncertainty for the cdf - n+ssa13 x - ray sources in each of four hard x - ray flux bins . since the average submillimeter flux is consistent with being constant as a function of x - ray flux , the ratio of the submillimeter to x - ray flux rises with decreasing x - ray flux .",
    "a better approach may be to translate the measured average 850  @xmath0 m flux per x - ray source to an x - ray source contribution to the 850  @xmath0 m ebl .",
    "the scuba jiggle maps cover an area of 194  arcmin@xmath11 . excluding the chapman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) sources , which lie outside this area , there are 131 x - ray selected sources with an average flux per source of @xmath30  mjy , where the uncertainty is again based on the random samples described in   [ smmflux ] .",
    "this translates to an 850  @xmath0 m ebl of @xmath31  mjy  deg@xmath32 , which is @xmath33 percent of the total 850  @xmath0 m ebl , if we adopt the @xmath34  mjy  deg@xmath32 value of puget et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , or @xmath35 percent of the total , if we adopt the @xmath36  mjy  deg@xmath32 value of fixsen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . since our results indicate that the integrated 850  @xmath0 m ebl is proportional to the total number of x - ray sources , the overall contribution to the ebl may increase with additional weaker x - ray sources . however , the rapid convergence of the x - ray number counts below @xmath37  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 ( garmire et al .",
    "2001b ) suggests that this correction would not be large .",
    "if the submillimeter flux represents the reprocessing of the radiated energy in the more obscured agn , then we may expect to see a dependence of the submillimeter excess on x - ray hardness . however , an opposing tendency is introduced by redshift : 850  @xmath0 m source detections are primarily expected to be at @xmath7 because of the strong negative _ k_-corrections at this wavelength that nearly compensate for cosmological dimming , while high redshift x - ray sources will appear softer in the observed frame than in the rest frame .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot 850  @xmath0 m flux versus effective photon index for the nearly complete cdf - n hard x - ray sample ( squares ) above @xmath38  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 ( @xmath2  kev ) , where the photon indices are well defined .",
    "we include on the figure the ssa13 hard x - ray sources ( circles ) from barger et al .",
    "( 2001a ) to better sample the bright x - ray flux end . of the eight significantly detected submillimeter sources which are present in this more restricted sample , six ( including the ssa13 source )",
    "are clustered at low @xmath15 values , which suggests they are obscured systems , while the remaining two ( including a non - radio cdf - n source ) have quite high @xmath15 values , which suggests they are unobscured systems or obscured systems at high redshift .",
    "it should be kept in mind that we expect there to be one or two spurious detections in the sample , so these objects could be false positives",
    ".    a more robust result can be obtained by considering the average properties of the sources . dividing the cdf - n+ssa13 combined sample into hard sources with @xmath39 and soft sources with @xmath40",
    ", we find that the hard sources have an average submillimeter flux of @xmath41  mjy , which is substantially larger than the value of @xmath42  mjy in the soft sample .",
    "this suggests that most of the submillimeter flux is indeed coming from the obscured sources , although even the soft sources have a significant submillimeter excess .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot redshift versus submillimeter flux for the unrestricted cdf - n ( squares ) and ssa13 ( circles ) samples .",
    "sources with spectroscopic redshifts are separated from sources without by two dotted lines at @xmath43 and at @xmath44 . below the @xmath43 line",
    ", we plot the spectroscopically unidentified sources with magnitudes @xmath45 , which corresponds to the @xmath46 definition of barger et al .",
    "( 2001a ) for optically bright galaxies . these sources ,",
    "although bright enough for spectroscopic identification , have not yet been observed ; they will likely populate the same region of the plot as the low redshift sources . above the @xmath44 line",
    ", we plot the spectroscopically unidentified sources with magnitudes @xmath47 .",
    "these sources are generally too optically faint for spectroscopic identification .",
    "all but two of the significantly detected submillimeter sources fall into this region of the plot , which is consistent with the conclusion of previous scuba surveys that most submillimeter sources are optically faint .",
    "the two significantly detected submillimeter sources which are not optically faint have been observed spectroscopically : the spectrum for the @xmath48 source , which is also a radio source , shows strong balmer absorption features and [ neiii ] in emission , so it appears to be a reliable identification , whereas the spectrum for the @xmath49 source , which is not also a radio source , looks relatively normal , and thus its identification with the submillimeter source could be spurious .",
    "again it is instructive to consider the average submillimeter properties of the x - ray sources , this time according to redshift bin .",
    "the average submillimeter flux is significant in both the @xmath43 to 1 ( @xmath50  mjy ) and the @xmath51 to 3.5 ( @xmath52  mjy ) spectroscopic redshift bins .",
    "moreover , the average submillimeter flux of the unidentified optically faint x - ray sources is highly significant ( @xmath53  mjy ) .",
    "the average submillimeter flux of the unidentified optically bright x - ray sources is not significant ( @xmath54  mjy ) but is consistent with these sources populating the same region of the plot as the sources with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows how the unidentified optically faint x - ray sources tend to separate according to 850  @xmath0 m flux into sources with radio counterparts and sources without .",
    "in fact , all but one of the significant scuba sources without a spectroscopic identification have radio counterparts .",
    "this result is again consistent with previous analyses of scuba data which found that targeted scuba surveys of optically faint radio sources are a far more efficient means of identifying scuba sources than random blank field surveys ( barger et al .",
    "2000 ; chapman et al .  2001 ) .",
    "quantitatively , the average submillimeter flux of the optically faint x - ray sources with radio counterparts is @xmath55  mjy , which is significant at above the @xmath56 level .",
    "in contrast , the average submillimeter flux of the optically faint x - ray sources without radio counterparts is not significant ( @xmath57  mjy ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] illustrates one additional property we can learn about the x - ray sources with significant submillimeter detections : their millimetric redshifts ( carilli & yun 2000 ; barger et al .",
    "we have overlaid on the data three curves which show the submillimeter flux dependence of a redshifted 20  @xmath0jy , 40  @xmath0jy , or 100  @xmath0jy radio source whose spectral energy distribution is assumed to be like that of the prototypical ulig arp  220 . from these curves we can see that the unidentified optically faint sources that are significantly detected in the submillimeter are likely to fall in the redshift range between @xmath51 and 3 .",
