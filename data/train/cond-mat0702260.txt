    "excitons are known to be composite particles made of one electron and one hole .",
    "they of course interact through the electron - electron , hole - hole and electron - hole coulomb potentials .",
    "they also interact in a quite subtle manner , through pauli exclusion between the fermions from which they are made .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study how this pauli exclusion enters the exciton transition rate and lifetime .",
    "the major difficulty induced by the composite nature of the excitons is the impossibility to identify an interaction potential _ between _ excitons , even for the coulomb contribution . while the electron - electron and hole - hole coulomb potentials are unambiguously parts of the interaction between two excitons , such an identification is ambiguous for the electron - hole parts . indeed , while @xmath3 is part of the interaction between excitons made of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the same @xmath6 is clearly _ not _ part of the interaction between excitons if these excitons are made of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "since electrons and holes are indistinguishable , there is no way to know how these two excitons are made , so that there is no way to write the part of the coulomb interaction between two excitons properly .    in spite of this obvious problem ,",
    "various procedures [ 1,2 ] have been proposed to replace the semiconductor hamiltonian written in terms of electrons and holes by an effective hamiltonian written in terms of excitons considered as elementary bosons , with an effective exciton - exciton potential between them .",
    "even if the bosonization procedures may appear as rather sophisticated [ 3 ] , it is clear that some uncontrolled manipulations have to be done in the mapping of the two - fermion subspace into the ideal boson subspace , in order to transform the exact electron - electron coulomb potential , written in terms of electron operators as @xmath9 , into a part of an exciton - exciton potential , which , in terms of exciton operators , reads as @xmath10 , these exciton operators being made of electron - hole pairs , _",
    "i_._e_. , @xmath11 being linear combinations of @xmath12 . in a previous work [ 4 ]",
    ", we have already shown that there is no way to find prefactors for these @xmath10 terms which could produce the correct correlations between two excitons at any order in the exciton - exciton interaction .",
    "we here show somewhat in details that there is no way to find @xmath10 prefactors which would produce _ both _ the exciton - exciton transition rate _ and _ the lifetime of an exciton state correctly , even in the case of just two excitons : if we know the correct value of one of these two physical quantities , for example the transition rate , we can possibly adjust the @xmath13 prefactors in the effective bosonic hamiltonian to recover the correct transition rate .",
    "however , there is no way to be sure that the _ same _ prefactors would give other physical quantities correctly , a factor of 2 being actually missed in the lifetime , as previously reported in ref .  [ 5 ] .",
    "this major failure , which puts the concept of effective bosonic hamiltonian to describe interacting excitons in a very bad shape , should push the very large amount of physicists using such effective hamiltonians [ 6 - 14 ] , to reconsider their works in the light of the many - body theory for `` cobosons ''  a contraction for composite bosons  that we have recently constructed [ 15 ] and which is free from any bosonization .",
    "the fact that a trustworthy exciton - exciton potential does not exist , has dramatic consequences on the possible treatment of many - body effects involving excitons .",
    "indeed , all known approaches to many - body effects [ 16,17 ] are based on rewriting the hamiltonian as @xmath1 , with @xmath0 being the interaction potential responsible for the many - body effects , and treating @xmath0 as a perturbation , possibly at infinite order in case of singularities . without the availability of such a potential @xmath0 , a novel many - body procedure , which does not rely on a would - be @xmath0 , has thus to be constructed from scratch in order to derive many - body effects between excitons .",
    "this is the purpose of the theory we are presently developing .    in order to put the difficulty associated with the composite nature of the excitons on a proper formal basis , it is of importance to realize that all failures in the previous approaches to the exciton many - body physics can be traced back to the difficulty of properly handling pauli exclusion , which prevents these excitons from being exact bosons .",
    "let us introduce the exciton creation operators @xmath14 as being such that the @xmath15 s are the exact one - electron - hole - pair eigenstates of the semiconductor hamiltonian , @xmath16 @xmath17 being the vacuum state .",
    "these operators can be expanded on the free - electron - hole - pair operators as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the creation operators for free electrons and free holes , with momentum @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is the @xmath24 exciton wave function in momentum space , namely @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the @xmath24 exciton center - of - mass momentum and @xmath27 is the relative motion wave function of the @xmath24 exciton in @xmath28 space , with @xmath29 . using eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) , it is straightforward to show that , while @xmath30=0 $ ] as usual for bosons , the commutator @xmath31 $ ] differs from @xmath32 , which would be its value if the excitons were elementary bosons .    in order to set up on a precise ground the formalism associated to the fact that excitons differ from elementary bosons , we have been led to introduce [ 18,19 ] the set of pauli parameters @xmath33 defined as @xmath34=\\sum_n\\left[\\lambda\\left(^{n\\ j}_{m\\ i}\\right)+\\lambda\\left(^{m\\ j}_{n\\ i}\\right)\\right]\\,b_n^\\dag\\ , \\ ] ] where the @xmath35 s are `` deviation - from - boson operators '' defined as @xmath36=\\delta_{mi}-d_{mi}\\ .\\ ] ] the physical understanding of these @xmath33 parameters and their link with the exciton composite nature become transparent once their expressions in real space is given : as rederived in appendix a , these parameters read @xmath37 where the @xmath24 exciton wave function in real space is @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , for sample size @xmath40 and space dimension @xmath41 .",
    "the pauli parameter @xmath42 corresponds to a hole exchange when forming the `` out '' excitons @xmath43 from the `` in '' excitons @xmath44 ( see fig.1a ) .",
    "these exchange parameters are not exactly exchange scatterings in the sense that they are dimensionless .",
    "one important property of the @xmath42 parameters is the fact that if we cross the holes of two excitons twice , we come back to the original situation . as shown in appendix a , we indeed have @xmath45    another transparent link between @xmath42 and the possibility to exchange the carriers in forming two excitons is the fact that we can rewrite any @xmath46 in terms of all the other @xmath47 s according to @xmath48 as shown in appendix a , this equation is obtained by writing the @xmath24 exciton in terms of @xmath49 and by forming the @xmath50 exciton out of @xmath51 .",
    "we expect the physics associated to the non - purely bosonic nature of the excitons to appear through exchange processes of various kinds , which are all going to be expressed in terms of these @xmath33 s .",
    "the pure - bosonic exciton approximation used in the effective bosonic hamiltonian corresponds to take all these @xmath42 s equal to zero , _",
    "after _ having somehow cooked them with coulomb processes , once and for all , to produce an exciton - exciton scattering `` dressed by exchange '' .",
    "in addition to non - bosonic behavior , the fact that the excitons are made of indistinguishable carriers makes the coulomb interaction _ between _ excitons quite tricky to define properly , as discussed above .",
    "we however need to identify such a quantity in a formal way , if we want to set up a procedure for handling many - body effects between excitons , since of course they are going to contain a certain amount of coulomb processes . by writing [ 18,19 ] @xmath52=e_i\\ b_i^\\dag+v_i^\\dag\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath53=\\sum_{mn}\\xi^\\mathrm{dir}\\left(^{n\\ j}_{m\\ i}\\right)\\ , b_m^\\dag b_n^\\dag\\ , \\ ] ] we in fact generate the set of coulomb scatterings we want .",
    "indeed , as rederived in appendix b , @xmath54 reads as @xmath55\\nonumber\\\\ \\times \\phi_i(\\v r_e,\\v r_h)\\,\\phi_j(\\v r_{e'},\\v r_{h'})\\nonumber\\\\ = \\xi^\\mathrm{dir}\\left(^{m\\ i}_{n\\ j}\\right)=\\xi^\\mathrm{dir}\\left(^{j\\ n}_{i\\ m}\\right)^\\ast\\ , \\hspace{7.3cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 . we see that , in this @xmath57 , the `` in '' exciton @xmath24 and `` out '' exciton @xmath50 are made with the same pairs @xmath4 and similarly for the excitons @xmath58 ; so that , in @xmath57 , the electron - hole coulomb interaction @xmath59 is unambiguously a coulomb interaction _ between _ both the `` in '' excitons @xmath44 and the `` out '' excitons @xmath43 ( see fig.1b ) .",
    "let us add that , while the exchange parameters @xmath33 are dimensionless , these @xmath57 s are energy - like quantities .    using these @xmath57 s and @xmath33 s , it is possible to derive the many - body physics of excitons in an exact way .",
    "in particular , we can construct the two exchange coulomb scatterings which exist between two excitons . as rederived in appendix c ,",
    "the one in which the coulomb interaction takes place between the `` in '' excitons @xmath44 only reads @xmath60\\phi_i(\\v",
    "r_e,\\v r_h)\\ ,",
    "\\phi_j(\\v r_{e'},\\v r_{h'})\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\xi^\\mathrm{in}\\left(^{m\\ i}_{n\\ j}\\right)\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this coulomb scattering , the electron - hole part @xmath59 is between the `` in '' excitons @xmath44 but `` inside '' the `` out '' excitons @xmath43 ( see fig.1c ) . in a similar way , @xmath61\\phi_i(\\v r_e,\\v r_{h'})\\ , \\phi_j(\\v r_{e'},\\v r_h)\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\xi^\\mathrm{out}\\left(^{m\\ i}_{n\\ j}\\right)=\\left[\\xi^\\mathrm{in}\\left(^{j\\ n}_{i\\ m}\\right)\\right]^\\ast\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] contains all coulomb interactions between the `` out '' excitons @xmath43 , its electron - hole part being inside the `` in '' excitons @xmath44 ( see fig.1d ) .",
    "the exchange parameters @xmath42 being dimensionless , it is possible to build energy - like scatterings out of them , through @xmath62 note that , as the exciton energy contains the band gap , scatterings having the sum of the `` in '' and `` out '' energies , instead of the difference , would depend on the band gap , which is physically unacceptable for many - body effects coming from carrier interactions . actually , such scatterings never appear .",
    "it turns out that @xmath63 defined in eq .",
    "( 1.12 ) is not an independent scattering but reads in terms of the two exchange coulomb scatterings defined in eqs .",
    "( 1.10 - 11 ) as ( see appendix d ) @xmath64    from the above discussion , we see that four scatterings between two excitons are energy - like quantities , namely @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect the exciton - exciton transition rates to read in terms of a linear combination of these four scatterings .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to determine this linear combination by using a full - proof procedure .    in order to do it ,",
    "the first difficulty is to identify the proper way to determine these transition rates .",
    "if an exciton - exciton potential were to exist , the exciton - exciton transition rate would result from the fermi golden rule written in terms of this potential .",
    "as such a potential does not exist , it is necessary to construct a formal equivalent of this fermi golden rule in which @xmath2 only enters , _",
    "i_._e_. , in which @xmath2 is not split as @xmath69 .",
    "this formal equivalent , already given in ref .",
    "[ 5 ] , is rederived in the section 2 of this paper , somewhat in details , for completeness .    in order to calculate these transition rates",
    ", we also need to identify the relevant `` in '' and `` out '' states of the transition .",
    "for that , we first note that an @xmath70-electron - hole - pair state can always be written in terms of free pair states , @xmath71 , the representation on this free pair basis being unique .",
    "however , as electron - hole pairs are highly correlated into excitons when their density in bohr radius unit is small compared to 1 , the representation of physical relevance for @xmath70-pair states in the low density limit , is for sure not the one in terms of free pair states but the one in terms of exciton states , namely @xmath72 .",
    "this physically relevant representation however is mathematically unpleasant because , due to eq .",
    "( 1.6 ) , it is not unique , the @xmath70-exciton basis being overcomplete . as shown in details below , it is actually possible to deal with this unpleasant feature and to calculate the time evolution of any of these @xmath70-exciton states , using the expression of the fermi golden rule given in section 2 .    among these @xmath70-exciton states , the state @xmath73 , with all the excitons in the same state 0 , is particularly simple and of possible physical interest . indeed , while it is _ not _ the exact ground state of @xmath70 excitons  otherwise it would not evolve with time ,  it is close to it .",
    "moreover , this state is the one coupled to @xmath70 photons tuned to the ground state exciton , so that it plays an important role in all semiconductor optical nonlinear effects .",
    "although the state @xmath73 may appear as particularly simple , let us stress that the precise calculation of its time evolution already contains three major difficulties : ( i ) the first one is to correctly determine the time evolution of composite bosons taking into account all the carrier exchanges which can take place between them .",
    "( ii ) the second one comes from the difficulty of handling many - body effects between a large number of these composite particles .",
    "( iii ) the third one comes from the fact that excitons have a spin degree of freedom .",
    "as the exchange processes mix the electrons and holes of two excitons , they also mix their spins .",
    "they , in particular , transform two bright excitons with opposite spins , @xmath74 , into two dark excitons with opposite spins @xmath75 . if we take into account these spin degrees of freedom , the exchange parameter @xmath42 , defined through eq .",
    "( 1.2 ) , becomes a @xmath76 matrix , each bulk exciton having @xmath77 spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the situation is somewhat better for narrow quantum wells since the light hole band with spins @xmath78 is well separated from the heavy hole band with spins @xmath79 , so that we can forget it .",
    "however , the @xmath42 parameter is still a 16@xmath8016 matrix .    in order to reach a deep understanding of the tricky physics involved in these exciton scatterings , we find appropriate to divide this work into three parts .",
    "mainly deals with the composite character of the excitons by considering the time evolution of _ two excitons without spin degree of freedom_. this physically corresponds to have two electrons with same spin and two holes with same spin , as possibly produced by the absorption of two circularly polarized photons in a quantum well .    in section 3",
    ", we calculate its time evolution using the formalism of the effective bosonic hamiltonian , as many physicists commonly think about excitons in this way .    in section 4 ,",
    "we calculate the time evolution of the state @xmath81 made of two identical composite excitons . from it , we derive the lifetime of this state as well as the transition rate towards another two - exciton state @xmath82 , using the formal equivalent of the fermi golden rule rederived in the section 2 of this paper .    in section 5 , we qualitatively discuss the various results obtained by using the effective hamiltonian in which the excitons are replaced by elementary bosons , with similar quantities obtained for composite excitons .    in section 6 ,",
    "we quantitatively calculate the various elementary scatterings that our composite exciton formalism introduces , namely @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , in the case of 2d ground state excitons , when the two `` in '' excitons have the same momentum .",
    "we also calculate the transition rate of this two - composite - exciton state , as a function of momentum transfer @xmath87 , and we compare it to its value when excitons are replaced by elementary bosons .",
    "we see that the discrepancy is quite large , except for very small momentum transfer or in the limit of infinitely heavy holes .",
    "this strongly questions the impressive fits of experimental results obtained by using the standard exciton - exciton scatterings dressed by exchange , since in real experiments , the hole mass is never that large , to make all exchange scatterings equal .",
    "we also see that the exciton - exciton transition rate does not monotically decrease with increasing momentum transfer , but cancels for a finite value of the momentum transfer @xmath87 .",
    "this cancellation may suggest that , in order to get a physically relevant transition rate at large momentum transfer , it might be necessary to go beyond the fermi golden rule , _",
    "i.  e. _ , the born approximation .",
    "however , it might also be possible that this cancellation survives beyond born approximation .",
    "the discrepancy between the results obtained for elementary and composite bosons is not fortuitous but has a quite deep origin .",
    "indeed , the bosonic approach has to fail in an irretrievable way because of a mathematical reason .",
    "bosonic exciton states form an orthogonal basis for two - pair states . on the opposite ,",
    "composite exciton states form an overcomplete set , due to the composite nature of the particles .",
    "this overcompleteness is directly linked to the appearance of an additional factor 1/2 between the inverse lifetime and the sum of transition rates , which comes from the difference which exists in the closure relations of composite and elementary bosons , as explicitly shown in ref .  [",
    "the existence of this factor 1/2 in fact shows that _ it is impossible to build a set of effective scatterings which would produce both , the lifetime and the transition rate towards another exciton state , correctly .",
    "this actually constitutes a strong mathematical proof that we can not forget the composite nature of the particles , even in the extremely low density limit of just two excitons . _    since the calculations with composite excitons we present here , use quantities we have introduced in various previous works dealing with what we first called `` commutation technique '' , we have found useful to rederive the important relations between these quantities in a self - contained appendix with coherent notations , some of these derivations being actually simpler than the ones we first gave .    , we will still consider two excitons only , but we will take into account the spin degrees of freedom of these excitons . from the interplay between direct and exchange scatterings , it is possible to deduce a set of interesting polarization effects between the photons which create the initial state and the bright and dark states produced by its time evolution . in this paper ii , we will consider all possible polarizations for quantum wells only . in the case of bulk samples , it is more appropriate to speak in terms of polaritons , instead of excitons",
    ". the physics of interacting polaritons is _ a priori _ very similar to the one of interacting excitons , the additional photon part of the polariton of course being an elementary boson .",
    "we are soon going to propose a new approach to interacting polaritons .",
    "this will allow us to derive the various subtle polarization effects which come from the fact that exchange processes between the exciton parts of the polaritons are described by exchange parameters @xmath42 which now are 64@xmath8064 matrices .    will deal with @xmath70-exciton states .",
    "the change from 2 to @xmath70 is not small ; it induces some very substantial difficulties .",
    "one important  but quite tricky  aspect of the @xmath70-exciton physics is the fact that , unlike for @xmath70 electrons , many - body effects with @xmath70 excitons coming from exciton - exciton interaction are not associated to an order in coulomb interaction , but to an order in the dimensionless parameter associated to density , namely , @xmath88 with @xmath89 being the exciton bohr radius , @xmath40 the sample size and @xmath41 the space dimension .",
    "the factor @xmath70 entering this @xmath90 parameter can appear in calculations dealing with @xmath70 excitons in very many different ways .",
    "a careful counting of these @xmath70 s  and the exact cancellation of overextensive terms in @xmath91 with @xmath92  turns out to be rather tricky .",
    "however , this is only in this last paper on the time evolution of @xmath70-exciton states that we will really face the many - body physics of composite excitons in its full complexity .",
    "a short report on the scatterings between @xmath70 excitons , without spin degree of freedom , has been published in ref .",
    "[ 5 ] . its key result is the fact that the additional factor @xmath93 between the inverse lifetime and the sum of transition rates here shown for two excitons also exists for @xmath70 excitons . in a more recent work [ 20 ] ,",
    "we have established the link between this additional @xmath93 factor and the overcompleteness of the basis made with composite exciton states , by showing , in details , how this factor @xmath93 appears for @xmath94 and @xmath95 excitons , using the difference which exists in the closure relations of elementary and composite exciton states .",
    "the precise comparison between composite excitons and pure - bosonic excitons done in the present paper , leads us to think that the present `` coboson '' formalism must be of interest , not only for interacting excitons , but also for many other composite bosons : this coboson formalism , free from bosonization , might reveal unexpected physical effects or , at least , lead to a deeper understanding of the presently known physics .",
    "a first idea is to reinvestigate interacting hydrogen atoms , or to reconsider the physics of `` ultracold atoms '' , which is a domain of very high current interest .",
    "we can also think of using it in the on - going extensive studies of interactions between positronium atoms [ 21 ] : these atoms seem to be very good candidates to reveal the importance of fermion exchanges as they are formed with fermions having equal masses",
    ".    an easy switch from excitons to general cobosons is made by noting that the many - body physics of any other coboson is expected to depend on exchange parameters @xmath96 and direct scatterings @xmath97 , very similar to the ones defined in eqs .",
    "( 1.4 ) and ( 1.9 ) , where @xmath98 represent the spatial coordinates of the fermion pair at hand , @xmath99 being the wave function of the one - pair eigenstate of the system hamiltonian and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 the potentials between identical and different fermions .    with respect to the possible representation of the coboson many - body physics",
    ", we can note that the many - body theories at hand up to now [ 15,16 ] were designed to deal with interacting elementary particles , fermions or bosons ; so that the feynman diagrams which visualize the underlying perturbative theory , are rather easy to draw , due to the well defined interaction potentials which exist between these elementary quantum particles . for cobosons , we have had to construct , not only a new many - body theory , but also a fully new diagrammatic representation [ 22 ] .",
    "we have called these new diagrams `` shiva diagrams '' , in reference to the multiarm hindu god shiva , as they have a multiarm structure .",
    "these diagrams make appearing the elementary scatterings between two cobosons @xmath97 and @xmath96 .",
    "it is of importance to stress that , since an interaction potential between cobosons does not exist , the corresponding diagrams are not a simple visualization of a perturbative theory .",
    "let us consider that , at initial time @xmath103 , the system is in a normalized initial state @xmath104 which is not eigenstate of the system hamiltonian @xmath2 , otherwise it would not evolve with time . at time",
    "@xmath105 , this state reads @xmath106 by definition , @xmath107 is the state change due to the time evolution , while @xmath108 , with @xmath109 being the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the initial state ( we take @xmath110 throughout the paper ) : by writing @xmath111 instead of @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) , we have in @xmath112 introduced an irrelevant constant phase factor @xmath113 for convenience .",
    "we then note that @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the projector over the subspace perpendicular to @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath116 .",
    "it is then easy to check that the state change @xmath107 , which physically comes from scatterings in the initial state , can be rewritten as @xmath117 where we have set @xmath118 @xmath119 being a peaked function of width @xmath120 , which reduces to the usual dirac @xmath121 function in the limit of infinitely large time @xmath122 .    from the definition of the lifetime @xmath123 of the @xmath104 state ,",
