    "central to the problem is the transfer of energy between the mean and eddy processes as decomposed ( cf .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to quantify this transfer within the traditional reynolds decomposition framework , and use it to investigate a new strategy of fluid control . in a forthcoming paper",

    ", @xmath5 evolves as @xmath6 whose decomposed equations are    @xmath7    multiplying ( [ eq : tmean ] ) by @xmath8 , and ( [ eq : teddy ] ) by @xmath9 , and taking the mean , one arrives at the evolutions of the mean energy and eddy energy ( variance)@xcite@xcite    [ eq : te ] @xmath10    the terms in divergence form are generally understood as the transports of the mean and eddy energies , and those on the right hand side as the respective energy transfers .",
    "the latter are usually used to explain the mean - eddy interaction .",
    "particularly , when @xmath5 is a velocity component , the right hand side of ( [ eq : teeddy ] ) has been interpreted as the rate of energy extracted by reynolds stress , or `` reynolds stress extraction '' for short , against the mean field to fuel the eddy growth ; in the context of turbulence research , it is also referred to as the `` rate of turbulence production '' .",
    "an observation of the two `` transfer terms '' on the right hand sides of ( [ eq : te ] ) is that they are not symmetric ; in other words , they do not cancel out each other .",
    "in fact , they sum to @xmath11 , which in general does not vanish .",
    "this is not what one expects , as physically a transfer process should be a mere redistribution of energy between the mean and eddy processes , without destroying or generating energy as a whole .",
    "these two quantities therefore are not real transfers , and can not be used to measure the mean - eddy interaction .",
    "the reason for the asymmetry between the terms on the right hand side of ( [ eq : te ] ) is that they are intertwined with transport processes ; or alternatively , the divergence terms on the left hand side do not account for all the fluxes .",
    "some people such as pope@xcite add an extra term in the flux term of ( [ eq : temean ] ) to maintain the balance , but it is not clear how that term should be chosen on physical grounds .",
    "pedlosky@xcite pointed out that a partial solution of the problem is to take averages for these terms over a substantially large domain . this way the transport contributions",
    "may be reduced and hence the transfer stands out .",
    "liang and robinson@xcite argued that spatial averages should be avoided to retain the information of spatial intermittency in the energetics .",
    "they believed that a precise separation between the transport and transfer can be made to satisfy the above symmetric requirement .",
    "they even named the transfer thus obtained _ perfect transfer _ , in distinction from other transfers that may have been called in the literature .",
    "but in their paper a rigorous formalization was postponed to future work ; how the separation can be achieved is still open ,    this study intends to give this problem a solution in the traditional framework .",
    "a complete answer to the issue of separation raised in @xcite , which is based on a new mathematical apparatus , the _ multiscale window transform _ developed by liang and anderson ( manuscript submitted to siam j. multiscale model .",
    "simul . ) , is deferred to the sequel to this paper .",
    "the following two sections are devoted to the establishment of a rigorous formalism for the transfer @xmath2 .",
    "we first consider the case for a scalar field @xmath5 ( [ sect : scalar ] ) , and then extend to momentum equations ( [ sect : mom ] ) .",
    "the formalism is validated with a well - studied instability model of an atmospheric jet stream ( section  [ sect : kuo ] ) , and applied to harness the karman vortex street behind a circular cylinder ( [ sect : wake ] ) .",
    "a brief summary is presented in section  [ sect : summary ] .",
    "the transfer is sought within the reynolds decomposition framework .",
    "the key of the reynolds decomposition is reynolds averaging .",
    "it decomposes a field , for example a scalar field @xmath5 , into a mean @xmath8 plus a departure from the mean , @xmath12 .",
    "simple as it is , reynolds averaging actually introduces an important geometric structure which , as we will see shortly , helps to make the transfer problem easier .",
    "a reynolds average may be understood either as an ensemble mean , or an expectation with respect to the measure of probability .",
    "practically it may also be understood as an average in time or an average in some dimension of space .",
    "its basic properties include : ( 1 ) @xmath13 , ( 2 ) @xmath14 , for @xmath15 , and a corollary from the above two , ( 3 ) @xmath16 . to put all these understandings together , the decomposition can be recast in the framework of a hilbert space @xmath17 , with an inner product defined as , @xmath18 for any @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the space @xmath17 , that is , the ensemble , the probability space , or the space of functions over the time or spatial domain under consideration , if the overbar is , respectively , an ensemble mean , a probability expectation , or a time / spatial average .",
    "( it is interesting to note that the meaning of a reynolds averaging is two - fold : one is the mean state reconstruction , another the summation or integration operator in forming the inner product . )",
    "a reynolds decomposition thus splits @xmath17 into two subspaces , which contain the mean process and the eddy process",
    ". we will refer to these subspaces as _ windows _ , so we have a mean window and an eddy window .",
    "distinguish them respectively with subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "the concept of orthogonal windows puts the mean and eddy fields on the same footing , and will help to greatly simplify the derivation .",
    "an important step toward the solution of the transfer problem is finding the fluxes , and hence the transports , on the two scale windows .",
    "the ( @xmath28 ) and ( @xmath29 ) in ( [ eq : temean ] ) and ( [ eq : teeddy ] ) , though seemingly in flux forms , are not really the desiderata in a rigorous physical sense .",
    "one may see this through a simple argument of energy conservation , which requires that the mean and eddy fluxes sum to @xmath30clearly these two quantities do not meet the requirement .",
    "on the other hand , the concept of multiscale flux can be naturally introduced within the formalized reynolds decomposition framework .",
    "given a flow @xmath4 , the flux of an inner product @xmath31 over @xmath17 is @xmath32 ( @xmath4 is self - adjoint with respect to @xmath33 ) .",

    "likewise , @xmath56 and @xmath57 the mean - eddy energetics corresponding to ( [ eq : te ] ) are , therefore ,    [ eq : te2 ] @xmath58    with @xmath2 as shown in ( [ eq : transfer ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq : transfer ] ) and ( [ eq : transfer0 ] ) imply an important property for the transfer derived above ,    that is to say , the transfer thus obtained is a process of energy redistribution between the windows ; there is no energy generated or destroyed as a whole , just as one may expect . to distinguish from other energy transfers one",
    "may have encountered in the literature , we will refer to @xmath2 as _ perfect transfer _ , a term adopted from @xcite , when confusion might arise .    note the distinct difference between @xmath2 and the reynolds stress extraction as appears in ( [ eq : teeddy ] ) , @xmath59 , which traditionally has been used to interpret the generation of eddy events , and has been interpreted as , in the turbulence research context , the turbulence production rate . in sections  [ sect :",
    "kuo ] and [ sect : wake ] , we will see that these two are in general differently distributed in space and time .",
    "the transfer @xmath2 may be further simplified in expression .",

    "introduce a `` @xmath5-coupled eddy velocity '' @xmath62 then @xmath63 notice that @xmath64 is the mean energy of @xmath5 and is hence always positive , so whether eddies are produced is totally determined by the divergence of the @xmath5-coupled eddy flow .    the @xmath5-coupled eddy flow @xmath65 is introduced for notational simplicity and for physical understanding .",
    "one should be aware that @xmath2 is well defined , even though @xmath65 does not exist when @xmath66 . in that case , the original expression ( [ eq : transfer ] ) should be used .      practically the reynolds averaging",
    "is often performed with respect to time if the process is stationary , or some dimension of space if the process in homogeneous in that dimension .",
    "if the averaging is in time , the above derivations also apply , except that the time derivatives in ( [ eq : tk ] ) , ( [ eq : tek ] ) , ( [ eq : te2mean ] ) , and ( [ eq : te2eddy ] ) are gone .",
    "the transfer @xmath2 is still in the same form as ( [ eq : transfer ] ) .",
    "if the averaging is performed in a dimension of space , say , in @xmath67 , then the above derivation needs modification , as the averaging does not commute with @xmath68 .",
    "but we have the following extra properties : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , for any field @xmath71 . these substituted into the continuity equation @xmath72 yield @xmath73 . with these identities ,",
    "we repeat the procedures in the above subsection , and obtain : @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the @xmath76 operator with the @xmath67 component removed .",
    "notice that @xmath77 and @xmath8 are independent of @xmath67 , viz @xmath78 so we may add the left hand side of ( [ eq : tmp2 ] ) to ( [ eq : tmp1 ] ) to get @xmath79 which is precisely the same as ( [ eq : transfer ] ) in expression form .    in a brief summary ,",
    "we have derived the mean - eddy energy transfer for a passive scalar in an incompressible flow , which is `` perfect '' in the sense that the energy extracted from the mean is equal in amount to the energy released by the mean .",
    "the perfect transfer is invariant in expression form with averaging schemes .",

    "so only the nonlinear terms require some thought in deriving the perfect transfer .    in this case , the formalism with the momentum equations is then essentially the same as that with the evolution of a passive scalar , except that we now have three `` scalars '' for the three velocity components @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . if @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , for each component , there is a `` coupled eddy velocity '' defined by ( [ eq : tvelo ] ) , so we have @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , which are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , respectively . according to the preceding section",
    ", each velocity corresponds to a transfer as expressed by ( [ eq : transfer2 ] ) .",
    "the total kinetic energy transfer is thence the sum of all the three transfers : @xmath93    as noted in subsection  [ sect : perfect ] , the above formula is well defined even when the mean velocity vanishes . in that case ,",
    "one just needs to expand it to obtain : @xmath94 where the second term in the curly braces is the very reynolds stress extraction : @xmath95 like those with a scalar field , these formulas stay invariant in form , no matter what an averaging scheme is adopted .",

    "the energy needed to fuel the growth could be transported from the neighborhood , rather than released _ in situ_. one possibility is , while disturbances rapidly grow , a process of laminarization could be undergoing at the very position .",

    "control of the eddy energy growth at both a and b indeed helps to suppress the onset of turbulence , but it is not optimal in terms of energy saving .",
    "suppression of @xmath133 defeats the intrinsic trend of laminarization in the mean time , and therefore reduces the control performance . to take advantage of this laminarization",

    "in the reynolds decomposition framework , the mean - eddy interaction has been rigorously formulated in terms of energy transfer , which can be singled out from the intertwined nonlinear processes by eliminating the transport effect .",
    "the resulting transfer sums to zero over the two decomposed subapces , or _ windows _ as called in the text . in other words ,",

    "the perfect transfer from the mean process to the eddy process can be explicitly written out . in the case of a scalar @xmath5 advected by an incompressible flow @xmath4 , traditionally there is a quantity @xmath159 which , when @xmath5 is a velocity component , has been explained as the rate of energy extracted by reynolds stress against the basic profile .",

    "this simple formalism can be easily generalized to those with momentum equations . in that case",
    ", the perfect transfer is a redistribution of kinetic energy between the mean and the eddy windows .",
    "the resulting transfer is referred to ( [ eq : transfervec ] ) .",
    "for all the averaging schemes , it has the same form .",
    "the formalism has been validated with a well - known barotropic instability model , the kuo model for the stability of a zonal atmospheric jet stream .",
    "instability implies energy transfer from the background to perturbation , or mean to eddy in this context .",
    "we have seen a scenario of perfect transfer consistent with that inferred based on kuo s theorem , while the traditional reynolds stress extraction does not agree with the inference .",
    "an intuitive argument regarding the perfect transfer @xmath2 is that the distribution of @xmath2 is generally not in accordance to that of eddy energy or eddy energy growth , due to the presence of transport processes .",
    "this has been testified in the wake control experiment . in the context of turbulence ,",
    "that is to say , the rapid growth of turbulent energy does not necessarily correspond to turbulence production .",
    "it is not uncommon that , at a location where perturbation is growing , the underlying process could be a transfer in the inverse direction , i.e. , a laminarization .",
    "this argument has profound implication in real applications .",
    "turbulence control is such an example .",
    "it suggests the optimal location to place a control be that of positive @xmath2 , rather than that of turbulence growth , in order to take the advantage of the self - laminarization within a turbulent flow .",
    "this conjecture has been testified in an exercise of vortex shedding suppression with a cylinder wake . by computation",
    "there are two lobes of strong positive @xmath2 attaching to the cylinder on either side .",
    "we tried a surface - based suction on many places of the cylinder , but the most effective places are those where the transfer processes within these two lobes are easiest to defeat",
    ". other places are not as effective as these two , in terms of energy saving .",
    "the success of the wake suppression experiment implies the physically robust quantity @xmath2 may be useful for a variety of fluid control problems .",
    "specifically , it may come to help in selecting the location(s ) to place a passive control , or designing the performance functional for an active control .",
    "the above experiment is an example for the former ; for the latter , we should be able to design some transfer - oriented functional for the optimization . as we argued before",
    ", this should be advantageous over those based on turbulence growth in light of energy saving .",
    "it should be pointed out that , in realistic flows , the signals are generally not stationary , nor homogeneous , and as a result , the reynolds averaging can not be replaced with an averaging over time or a spatial dimension . in such cases , the mean and eddy fields are not as simple as thus reconstructed ; the mean itself can be time varying .",
    "besides , interactions may not be limited just between two windows . a common process ,",
    "mean - eddy - turbulence interaction , for example , requires three distinct windows for a faithful representation .",
    "all these difficulties will be overcome , and a new real problem - oriented formalism will be realized in a forthcoming paper after the introduction of a new analysis apparatus , multiscale window transform , to replace the reynolds averaging technique for a realistic mean - eddy - turbulence decomposition .",
