    "recent developments in the physics of granular matter @xcite have illustrated that the dissipative nature of the interactions between grains can result in a variety of different phenomena .",
    "of particular interest in recent years has been the dynamics of vibrated granular materials @xcite , which exhibit stationary states as well as waves and complex patterns . in order to describe these diverse states of the material ,",
    "it is necessary to derive macroscopic descriptions by averaging over the microscopic details of the motion and interactions between individual grains .",
    "this goal has proved elusive , however , because a vibrated granular material is a driven dissipative system , and the interactions between the particles are characterised by a loss of energy due to inelastic collisions .",
    "the statistical mechanics framework developed for equilibrium or near equilibrium systems can not be used in this case .",
    "consequently , phenomenological models @xcite have been used to describe the dynamics of granular materials .",
    "the kinetic theories developed for granular flows @xcite usually assume that the system is close to `` equilibrium '' and the velocity distribution function is close to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "experimental studies and computer simulations have reported the presence of a uniformly fluidised state in a vibrated bed of granular material .",
    "luding , herrmann and blumen @xcite carried out ` event driven ' ( ed ) simulations of a two dimensional system of inelastic disks in a gravitational field vibrated from below , and obtained scaling laws for the density variations in the bed .",
    "an experimental study of a vibrated fluidised bed was carried out by warr , huntley and jacques @xcite .",
    "their experimental set up consisted of steel spheres confined between two glass plates that are separated by a distance slightly larger than the diameter of the spheres .",
    "the particles were fluidised by a vibrating surface at the bottom of the bed , and the statistics of the velocity distribution of the particles were obtained using visualisation techniques .",
    "profiles for the density and the mean square velocity were obtained , and the particle velocity distributions were also determined at certain positions in the bed .",
    "both of these studies reported that there is an exponential dependence of the density on the height near the top of the bed , similar to the boltzmann distribution for the density of a gas in a gravitational field .",
    "however , the dependence of the density deviates from the exponential behaviour near the bottom .",
    "the dependence of the mean square velocity on the vibration frequency and amplitude were found to be different in the two studies .",
    "a theoretical calculation of the distribution function in a vibro - fluidised bed was carried out by kumaran @xcite .",
    "the limit of low dissipation , where the coefficient of restitution @xmath1 is close to @xmath0 was considered . in this limit",
    ", the mean square velocity of the particles is large compared to the mean square of the velocity of the vibrating surface , and the dissipation of energy during a binary collision is small compared to the energy of a particle .",
    "a perturbation approximation is used , where the energy dissipation is neglected in the leading order approximation , and the system resembles a gas at equilibrium in a gravitational field .",
    "the velocity distribution function is a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , and the density decreases exponentially from the vibrating surface . the first order correction to the distribution due to dissipative effects",
    "was calculated using the moment expansion method , and the results were found to be in qualitative agreement with the experiments of warr et .",

    "the theoretical predictions @xcite were compared with previous experimental and simulation studies by mcnamara and luding @xcite .",
    "they found that the theory was in good agreement with experiments for dilute beds , where the area fraction of the particles is low , but there were systematic deviations from the theoretical predictions as the area fraction increases .",
    "this is to be expected , since the analysis assumed that the density is small and the pair distribution function was set equal to @xmath0 and therefore the pressure is related to the density by the ideal gas law .",
    "these assumptions become inaccurate as the area fraction of the bed increases .",
    "an approximate method for including the correction to the pair distribution function was suggested by huntley @xcite .    in the present analysis ,",
    "the correction to the low density theory of kumaran @xcite is determined for a vibro - fluidised bed where the coefficient of restitution is close to @xmath0 .",
    "an asymptotic analysis is used , where the dissipation is neglected in the leading approximation .",
    "the leading order density and velocity profiles are determined using the momentum balance equation in the vertical direction .",
    "in contrast to the earlier theory @xcite , the virial equation of state for a non - ideal two dimensional gas is used to determine the leading order density profile .",
    "the density profile differs from the boltzmann distribution , but the velocity distribution function is still a maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the leading order temperature is determined by a balance between the source and dissipation of energy as before .",
    "the complete equilibrium pair distribution function is used to determine the rate of dissipation of energy due to inelastic collisions .",
    "the results are compared with hard sphere md simulations , and also with earlier theoretical and simulation studies .",
    "the system consists of a bed of circular disks ( of diameter @xmath2 ) in a gravitational field driven by a vibrating surface .",
    "the vibrating surface has a periodic amplitude function but no assumption is made regarding the form of the function .",
    "there is a source of energy at the vibrating surface due to particle collisions with the surface , and the dissipation is due to inelastic collisions .",
    "a balance between the two determines the `` temperature '' , which is the mean square velocity of the particles .",
    "the limit of low dissipation , where the coefficient of restitution @xmath1 is close to @xmath0 , is considered . in this limit",
    ", it can be shown that the mean square velocity of the particles is large compared to the mean square velocity of the vibrating surface .",

    "( [ eq : mombal ] ) for the density profile is a first order ordinary differential equation , which can be solved using the mass conservation condition @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of particles per unit width of the bed .",
    "note that the leading order temperature @xmath5 is still unknown at this stage .",
    "this is determined using a balance between the source and dissipation of energy .",
    "the source of energy due to particle collisions with the vibrating surface is determined using an equilibrium average over the increase in energy due to particle collisions with the vibrating surface @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath18 represents the mean square velocity of the vibrating surface .",
    "the rate of dissipation of energy per unit width is calculated by averaging over the energy loss over all the collisions between particles and integrating over the height of the bed @xcite @xmath19 note that the @xmath20 appearing in @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the enskog factor which accounts for the increase in the frequency of collision for hard disks at high densities .",
    "the temperature @xmath5 can now be determined from the relation @xmath23 an analytical solution to the density variation eq .",

    "@xmath24 where the leading order temperature is given by , @xmath25 in the low - density limit the density decays exponentially from the bottom of the bed . at higher densities",
    "the solution to the density variation is no longer exponential throughout , and has to be obtained numerically by an iterative scheme . however , at large distances from the bottom , the bed is dilute and the ideal gas law holds good , hence the decay is exponential , even though near the bottom it is not .",
    "this gives a convenient starting point for the numerical integration from a _",
    "finite _ height , above which we assume the asymptotic solution ( @xmath26 ) to be given by an exponential decay known to within two undetermined constants .",
    "a value for the density and the temperature is assumed at this height and the integration is carried out up to the vibrating plate ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the complete density profile is obtained by combining the numerical and the asymptotic solutions . if the conditions eq .  ( [ eq : masscons ] ) and eq .",

    "the simulations are carried out only for the case of inelastic collisions , since the viscous drag requires a different treatment than the ed method .",

    "[ fig : ldlenu ] and  [ fig : hdlenu ] .",

    "the results agreed with the low density theory of @xcite but a systematic deviation was observed at high densities in all the cases .",
    "this deviation is captured in the present analysis .",
    "the leading order dissipation at low densities in the bed is given by @xcite @xmath33 in @xcite the total dissipation obtained from the simulation was normalised by a factor taken out from this leading order dissipation and a non dimensional number was defined as @xmath34 the scaling of this factor with the height of the center of mass ( @xmath35 ) above the position at rest ( @xmath36 ) was studied .",
    "this factor was found out for different parameter sets by varying the bottom wall velocity @xmath29 over several decades such that the bed is taken from a densely packed regime to a very low density regime .",
    "they chose a central data set and varied the parameters one at a time .",
    "it was found that in all the cases considered , the scaling relation collapsed to a single curve .",
    "the central parameter set has the following values @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the present analysis is valid when @xmath41 and when the frequency of particle - particle collision is much greater than the frequency of particle - wall collisions .",
    "it can be shown that in the leading order the ratio of the frequency of particle - particle collisions to the frequency particle - wall collisions is @xmath42 .",
    "hence the present analysis will hold good when @xmath43 .",
    "the central set corresponds to @xmath44 , @xmath45 and therefore we expect the present analysis to hold good for this case .",

    "it is seen that the present analysis correctly predicts the lowering of the coefficient @xmath47 at high densities .",
    "this reduction in the dissipation from the constant value at low densities is the net result of two opposing factors : ( i ) decrease in the density from the exponential behaviour near the vibrating bottom ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hdlenu ] ) , hence reducing the total value of the dissipation , and ( ii ) increase in frequency of collisions at high densities , increasing the dissipation .",
    "it is also seen that not all the theoretical predictions collapse on to a curve as is the case with the data from the simulation . in two of the cases",
    "the theory does not agree with the simulations because ( i ) in one the value of the perturbation parameter is high ( @xmath48 ) and the leading order theory is valid only for low @xmath49 , and ( ii ) in the other case the value of @xmath50 is low .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : theoscal ] , the apparent mismatch with ` e- ' is not a discrepancy with the model , but has got to do with the formula chosen used in @xcite for the normalisation of the dissipation factor @xmath47 .",
    "they had chosen to normalise the dissipation by a factor @xmath51 .",
    "while this might have given a better fit for high densities ( low center of mass ) , the correct factor for very low densities is @xmath52 as given by eq .",

    "in summary , a theory to describe the state of a vibro - fluidised bed in the dense limit was derived .",
