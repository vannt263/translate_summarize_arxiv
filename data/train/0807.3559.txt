    "control of thermal expansion properties of materials is of technological importance due the need for structures to withstand ambient temperature variations .",
    "it is also of fundamental interest because of the variety and intricacy of qualitatively different mechanisms by which materials expand or contract upon heating.@xcite in particular , negative thermal expansion ( nte ) behavior , a well - known but unusual phenomenon in many - particle systems , has been observed only in multi - component materials with open unit cell structures in which the bonding of component particles is highly directional . necessarily a result of anharmonicity of the potential energy of the system , the mechanism by which a material contracts upon heating may be highly intricate.@xcite    in the technological realm , materials with zero thermal expansion ( those that do not expand or contract upon heating ) can aid in the longevity of space structures , bridges and piping systems.@xcite it has been proposed that materials with very large thermal expansion coefficients may function as actuators , and those with negative thermal expansion coefficents may be of use as thermal fasteners.@xcite    perhaps the most common example of a solid exhibiting nte is that of ice , which contracts upon melting into liquid water.@xcite in its solid form , hexagonal ice also undergoes negative thermal expansion for very low temperatures.@xcite this behavior is a result of the volume dependence of the transverse normal mode ( phonon ) frequencies of this material , characterized by a negative _ grunisen parameter_.@xcite another example of a material that undergoes nte is zirconium tungstate , @xmath0 , which exhibits this behavior for an extremely large temperature range , namely @xmath1 through @xmath2.@xcite again , this has been attributed to the phonon properties of the crystal , specifically low frequency phonon modes that may propagate without distorting the @xmath3 tetrahedra and @xmath4 octahedra that make up the structure.@xcite other examples of materials that exhibit nte behavior are @xmath5,@xcite diamond and zincblende semiconductors,@xcite as well as @xmath6.@xcite an essential feature of the aforementioned systems is their relative openness ( low densities ) as compared to highly - coordinated structures .",
    "geometries for multicomponent composite systems that give rise to extreme nte behavior have been designed using topology optimization methods.@xcite in these cellular materials , each of three component materials has a nonnegative thermal expansion coefficient , but upon heating , the materials ( two solid phases and one void phase ) undergo overall contraction .",
    "an essential feature of these structures are their local non - convex ( re - entrant ) `` cells '' .",
    "this is an example of an _ inverse problem _ in the sense that optimal microstructures are found that yield a targeted macroscopic property ( in this case , nte behavior ) .    in previous",
    "work,@xcite we investigated whether isotropic potentials could be found that produce as ground states low - coordinate crystal structures ( e.g. , the honeycomb lattice in two dimensions and the diamond lattice ) using inverse optimization methodologies . here , we propose a solution to a different inverse problem : finding an isotropic pair potential that produces a classical many - particle system in a maximally coordinated , single - component solid state that undergoes nte under a wide temperature and pressure range ( including zero pressure ) .",
    "this is a counterintuitive proposition because conventional wisdom suggests that open structures composed of particles with highly directional interactions are necessary to observe nte .",
    "nonetheless , there is no fundamental reason for excluding this phenomenon in highly - coordinated isotropic systems .",
    "colloidal dispersions are a possible experimental test - bed system for nte behavior , as in these systems interparticle interaction potentials may be designed by combining several interaction types ( e.g. , electrostatic repulsion , depletion , and dispersion).@xcite although the potential proposed in this paper is not explicitly constructed from known colloidal interactions , it is possible that future developments will allow for such a potential to be devised .",
    "we have found that a sufficient condition for a potential to give rise to a system with nte behavior is that it exhibits a _ softened interior core _ within a basin of attraction ( as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) . such behavior of the potential may be characterized by its third derivative with respect to position at its minimum : if this is positive , the curvature is an increasing function of position and the inner part of the basin is `` softer '' than the outer part .",
    "the potential function proposed in this paper thus belongs to a class of functions that give rise to nte behavior ; it will henceforth called the softened - interior - core , or `` sic '' potential .",
    "it is constructed by using a type of optimization procedure wherein parameters are chosen such that the potential will give rise to strong nte behavior ( via a large , positive third derivative of the pair potential with respect to @xmath7 , the distance between particles ) . as will be explained in the next section , as the temperature is increased in such systems , the nearest - neighbor distances fluctuate about smaller average distances , causing nte behavior . to demonstrate this phenomenon ,",
    "we perform gibbs - ensemble ( constant number of particles , temperature and pressure , or `` npt '' ) monte carlo @xcite simulations in both two and three dimensions in which the volume of the system is computed as a function of both ambient temperature and pressure .",
    "we find that at low temperature , the system has its strongest negative thermal expansion . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the system contracts further until it reaches a minimum in volume ( or area ) , and then expands as a function of temperature before melting . as a basis for comparison , we perform similar calculations using the lennard - jones potential , which exhibits conventional behavior in that it only expands as temperature is increased .        in section",
    "ii , we discuss how the sic potential was constructed . in section iii , we discuss the details and results of the energetics calculations and npt simulations , for both the sic potential and for the lennard - jones potential . in section iv , we summarize the results and discuss future work pertaining to inverse problems in many - particle systems .",
    "we consider classical @xmath8-particle systems ( in two and three dimensions ) with interactions that are pairwise additive and isotropic . denoting the positions of the particles by @xmath9 and their momenta by @xmath10 ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a interaction potential that is a purely radial function , and @xmath13 is the mass of each particle , taken as unity for the remainder of this paper .",
    "henceforth we employ the reduced temperature of the system , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the temperature , @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath17 is a parameter in the pair potential with units of energy .",

    "of course , @xmath18 is negative if the system contracts upon heating .",

    ", the equilibrium configuration in two dimensions is the triangular lattice , and in three dimensions it is a maximally coordinated lattice ( the hexagonal close - packed , or hcp ) with the nearest neighbors lying within the basin of attraction of the potential .",
    "clearly , the curvature of the potential to the left of the minimum at @xmath27 is significantly greater than that to the right .",
    "this is reflected in the negative third derivative of the potential at its minimum , i.e. , @xmath28 . as a result , as the temperature is increased from zero , thermal fluctuations cause the distribution of nearest - neighbor distances to be skewed to the right .",
    "thus , in thermal equilibrium , the particles are farther apart on average , and so the system should expand upon a temperature increase , i.e. , @xmath29 . the behavior of the system should not qualitatively change if the pressure is positive .",
