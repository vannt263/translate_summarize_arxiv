    "starting point of our analysis are toroidal silica microcavites@xcite that intrinsically combine ultra - high-@xmath0 optical whispering gallery modes with around 20 mechanical modes in the 0 - 100 mhz range@xcite which are observable in an interferometric readout using the structure s optical modes ( see methods ) .",
    "recent work has shown that the intrinsic coupling of optical and mechanical modes of toroidal microcavities via radiation - pressure can give rise to the effect of dynamical backaction@xcite , which allows realization of narrow bandwidth photonic oscillators@xcite or photonic rf down - converters@xcite as well as radiation pressure cooling of a mechanical oscillator@xcite . the radial breathing mode ( cf .",
    "1a ) in particular exhibits strong optomechanical coupling , low effective mass ( @xmath2 ) and high frequency enabling the first demonstration of resolved sideband cooling of a micromechanical oscillator@xcite . to understand their mechanical @xmath0-factors which have remained completely unexplored so far , we first present a study of mechanical dissipation in microtoroids and subsequently show how the results from this study can be harnessed to devise structures with unprecedentedly low dissipation in the frequency range above @xmath3 . +      in order to assess the contribution of clamping losses , the diameter of the silicon pillar holding the silica resonator ( cf . fig .",
    "1a ) is varied . to this end",
    "consecutive @xmath4 etching cycles , undercutting the silica structure but leaving the silica itself unaffected , are applied .",
    "thus , the relative undercut @xmath5 ( @xmath6 : radius of the cavity , @xmath7 : length of the free standing membrane , cf .",
    "inset of fig .",
    "1a ) can be controlled .",
    "the dependence of the measured @xmath0-factors of the radial breathing mode ( rbm ) on the relative undercut is depicted in fig .",
    "intuitively , it may be expected that higher @xmath0-factors are attained for larger undercut due to a reduced clamping area .",
    "interestingly , however , the @xmath0-factors of six different microresonators of similar size show a strongly non - monotonous dependence on the relative undercut which contradicts the simple expectation of smaller losses for smaller clamping areas .",
    "moreover , the behaviour is remarkably reproducible for the different samples . a plot of the measured frequencies along with an fem simulation ( see methods ) of the toroids radially symmetric mechanical modes depicted in fig .",
    "1a shows excellent agreement of measured and simulated frequencies .",
    "furthermore , the fem simulation indicates an avoided crossing between different mechanical modes as first predicted by mindlin in 1951@xcite .",
    "a measurement with a different sample allows _ directly _ observing this avoided crossing by employing highly sensitive quantum limited optical displacement sensing ( see methods ) which allows to also monitor the flexural modes exhibiting weaker optomechanical coupling .",
    "the frequencies and the corresponding @xmath0-factors of both the radial breathing mode and a flexural mode obtained in this second measurement are shown in fig .",
    "the frequencies of both modes decrease for larger relative undercut , where the flexural mode shows a steeper slope .",
    "thus , it can be observed that the eigenfrequencies of both modes approach each other but , as predicted by fem simulations , they do not cross .",
    "moreover , both mode patterns hybridize and eventually swap their dispersion lines during the avoided crossing ( inset of fig . [",
    "it is exactly in the region in which both modes couple , where the @xmath0-factor of the rbm is found to be strongly reduced .",

    "1b ) . using the values",
    "obtained from this first fit , only @xmath15 remains as free parameter in equation ( [ coupledequation ] ) .",
    "a least square fit to both the measured frequencies and @xmath0-factors yields a coupling rate of @xmath22 , much larger than the damping rates @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding coupled frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath0-factors @xmath25 match the data remarkably well ( cf . fig .",
    "1b ) confirming that indeed both modes behave as two coupled harmonic oscillators giving rise to an avoided crossing between the rbm and the low-@xmath0 flexural mode .",
    "moreover , the data presented here , to the authors best knowledge , manifest the first direct observation of normal mode coupling of two different mechanical modes within a micromechanical resonator",
    ". +      for the @xmath0-factor of the rbm the avoided crossings are detrimental .",
    "the hybridization with the low-@xmath0 flexural modes strongly reduces the mechanical quality of the rbm in the coupling region due to enhanced displacement amplitudes in the clamping area .",
    "drawing on the quantitative power of fem simulations , it is indeed possible to show that the displacement amplitudes at the pillar strongly influence the mechanical @xmath0-factor . in order to study  and elucidate  the role of clamping losses the parameter @xmath11 , defined as : @xmath26 is introduced , where @xmath27 is the total energy stored in the oscillator , @xmath28 denotes the density of silica , and @xmath29 the speed of sound in silica , @xmath30 is the mechanical oscillation frequency and @xmath31 denotes the out of plane oscillation amplitude at position @xmath32 , with the integration extending over the clamping area @xmath33 .",

    "strikingly , @xmath11 is directly proportional to the measured @xmath0-factors , where @xmath12 , revealing good agreement of measured mechanical loss and fem simulations .",
    "this unambiguously shows that the mechanical quality factors are clamping loss limited .",
    "the        prefactor of @xmath36 may be attributed to impedance matching conditions between the silica disk and the silicon pillar which are not taken into account in this model . note that these , and all following measurements , were performed in a vacuum chamber ( @xmath37 ) to fully eliminate the possible influence of gas damping ( cf .",
    "2 ) . besides explaining the origin of the mechanical dissipation of different modes and proving that plainly reducing the clamping area to a minimum is _ not _ sufficient for optimized @xmath0-factors the parameter @xmath11 moreover allows _ a - priori _ modelling of the oscillator s mechanical quality .",
    "this constitutes a powerful , direct tool to design high-@xmath0 mechanical oscillators with negligible clamping losses , which we have used to devise the novel structures described below .",

    "3a consisting of a toroid resonator with four spokes connecting it to the silicon support .",
    "incorporation of the silica spokes into a toroidal microresonator is possible by following the fabrication steps as shown in fig .",
    "importantly , the design allows independent control of the spokes width , length and position for any major and minor diameter of the optical toroid microcavities yielding further degrees of freedom to tune their mechanical frequencies .",
    "moreover , using the aforementioned fem model of the clamping loss limited @xmath0-factors , i.e. maximizing @xmath11 , the geometry can be chosen such that the discrete eigenfrequencies of the spokes decouple the toroid s radial motion from the center of the silica disk , strongly mitigating clamping losses .",

    "moreover , the extracted temperature independent background sets an upper bound for remaining clamping losses of @xmath53 experimentally confirming that a strong reduction of clamping losses is achieved . for this specific sample",
    "the @xmath11 model predicts six times lower clamping losses .",
    "thus , it is likely that asymmetries in the structure cause additional clamping losses not taken into account in the above fem model leading to the observed background of @xmath66 .",
    "it is noted that thermoelastic damping@xcite for which an upper bound of @xmath67 is found for the resonators considered here , can safely be neglected in this analysis .",
    "the intrinsic losses of silica ( i.e. those caused by tls and anharmonicity ) are known to exhibit a local minimum at a temperature of around @xmath68@xcite and thus a further increase in temperature is expected to yield even higher @xmath0-factors than those reported here .",
    "+ the quantification of remaining clamping loss limit yielding values above @xmath69 is also very important for the prospects of future low temperature experiments , as the intrinsic losses in amorphous materials can be strongly reduced by cryogenic operation@xcite . after reaching a maximum at @xmath70",
    "the intrinsic losses decrease again at lower temperatures ( cf .",

    "it is well known@xcite that the @xmath0-factors reach a plateau of @xmath71 before rapidly increasing below a drop - off temperature @xmath72 which shows a strong frequency dependence . for khz frequencies ,",
    "the drop - off temperature resides in the @xmath73-range@xcite and therefore silica is commonly not considered as a suitable material for low temperature oscillators .",
    "it is noted , however , that for high oscillation frequencies the drop - off temperature strongly increases and for e.g. @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) in @xcite the intrinsic loss limited @xmath0-factors were measured to reach 50,000 at @xmath76 while quality factors exceeding 100,000 may be extrapolated for a temperature of @xmath77@xcite .",
    "thus , the spoke supported resonators are very promising optomechanical devices for cryogenic operation with the prospect of even improving the demonstrated outstanding room temperature @xmath0-factors at low temperature , possibly approaching the extracted clamping loss limit beyond @xmath78 .",
    "in summary , we presented novel micron - scale on - chip optomechanical resonators that for the first time allow independent control of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom within one and the same device .",
    "avoided crossings of mechanical modes ( as first predicted by mindlin@xcite ) were observed which enabled a detailed understanding of mechanical dissipation , allowing the design of optomechanical systems combining mechanical @xmath0-factors of 80,000 , on par with the best published results in the frequency range above 30 mhz , with ultra - high optical finesse .",
    "this property yields improved performance for applications such as realizing narrow band filters and narrow line - width radiation pressure driven``photonic clocks''@xcite .",
    "yet , it is also an essential ingredient in studies which seek to demonstrate quantum signatures of mesoscopic objects@xcite . to illustrate this point , the ratio of displacement spectral density provided by radiation pressure quantum back - action and the thermal noise spectral density is given@xcite : @xmath79 = \\frac{4 \\xi^2}{1 + 4 \\omega_\\mathrm{m}^2/\\kappa^2}\\frac{\\hbar\\ , q\\ , \\mathcal{f}^2}{\\lambda ( c / n)\\ , \\pi\\ , k_b t\\ , m \\omega_\\mathrm{m}}\\,p$ ] ( @xmath80 for a linear cavity and @xmath81 for a ring - cavity , @xmath82 : power impinging on the cavity ) .",

    "thus , radiation pressure quantum back - action  which so far has remained experimentally inaccessible  may get within reach .",
    "moreover , at a bath temperature of @xmath83 , and for a mechanical @xmath0-factor of 80,000 already one tenth of the radiation - pressure cooling rates of @xmath94 demonstrated in silica microtoroids@xcite would enable laser cooling of the rbm in the resolved sideband regime to an occupation number of @xmath95 , below unity , and would thus allow to venture into the regime of cavity _ quantum _ optomechanics .",
    "+ pertaining to the wider implications of our work , the studied aspects of geometry dependent mechanical dissipation via mode coupling ( which is also important for nanomechanical beam resonators@xcite ) and the demonstrated quantification of clamping losses can be of broad interest and could directly be applicable to other whispering gallery mode resonators made of amorphous@xcite and crystalline material@xcite as well as to a wide range of other micro- and nanomechanical oscillators , such as photonic crystal based systems@xcite which are also expected to exhibit optomechanical coupling .",
    "to monitor the mechanical modes thermal noise , laser light is coupled to the high-@xmath0 optical whispering gallery mode of the silica resonators using a tapered optical fibre .",
    "an external cavity diode laser is locked detuned by approximately half the optical line - width @xmath96 with respect to a cavity resonance @xmath97 .",

    "spectral analysis of the transmitted power thus allows extracting the mechanical frequencies @xmath101 and dissipation rates @xmath102 from which the corresponding quality factor @xmath103 is inferred . to minimize radiation pressure induced back - action , i.e. to rule out any amplification@xcite or cooling@xcite which would lead to a modification of the natural line - width@xcite ,",
    "the laser power used in these measurements is kept at a very low level , well below the threshold for the parametric instability@xcite . as an additional check the measurements",
    "are always performed both on the red and blue detuned wing of the optical resonance .",
    "the @xmath0-factors from both measurements usually agree within less than @xmath104 , indicating negligible radiation pressure backaction . + in order to achieve a higher displacement sensitivity allowing to observe further mechanical modes of the microresonators , and in particular the avoided crossing in fig .",
