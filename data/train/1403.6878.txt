    "diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) operating at the shocks of supernova remnants  ( snrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) is the most likely mechanism to convert the kinetic energy released by supernova explosions into high energy particles ( cosmic rays ; crs ) that obey a power - law type distribution .",
    "evidence of the cr proton acceleration in snrs has emerged from the detection of gev @xmath0 rays from some snrs interacting with molecular clouds such as w51c , w44 , and ic 443  @xcite by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope_. the intense gev emission from those snrs is naturally explained by @xmath3 decay produced in inelastic collisions of the accelerated protons with dense gas .",
    "this was recently confirmed by the detection of the characteristic spectral feature produced by the decay of @xmath3s in w44 and ic 443  @xcite . in dsa theory ,",
    "crs accelerated at the shock are scattered by self - generated magnetic turbulence . since the highest - energy crs in the shock precursor at the upstream are prone to lack self - generated turbulence , they are expected to escape from the shock  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been unclear how the crs escape from snrs and propagate into the interstellar medium ( ism ) because the interplay among the crs , the magnetic turbulence , and the surrounding environment of snrs is not well understood .",
    "if an snr is in a dense environment , we can expect an enhancement of the @xmath3-decay @xmath0 rays from molecular clouds illuminated by the escaping crs in the vicinity of the snr  @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath0-ray emissions near middle - aged snrs g8.7@xmath10.1 and w44 are naturally explained by the above scenario  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the crs alters their spectrum , which affects the spectral shape of the resulting @xmath0-ray emission  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can constrain the diffusion coefficient by measuring the wide - band @xmath0-ray spectrum of the emission around snrs .",
    "w28 ( also known as g6.4@xmath10.1 ) is a mixed - morphology snr whose age is estimated to be ( 3.515 )  @xmath5  10@xmath7  yr  @xcite . in this paper , we adopted the same age of 4  @xmath5  10@xmath7  yr as used in  @xcite .",
    "the snr is located within a molecular cloud complex with a mass of 1.4  @xmath5  10@xmath8  @xmath9  @xcite and interacts with some parts of the cloud , traced by the detection of oh ( 1720  mhz ) masers  @xcite .",
    "observations of molecular lines placed w28 at a distance of @xmath41.9  kpc  @xcite .",
    "gev @xmath0-ray emission associated with w28 has been detected by the lat and the gamma - ray image detector ( grid ) onboard _ agile _",
    "a natural explanation is the decay of @xmath3s due to the interaction of the cloud and crs accelerated in the snr  @xcite .",
    "w28 is considered to have entered the radiative phase  @xcite as indicated by optical filaments  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can expect that crs have escaped into the surrounding ambient medium .",
    "observations of w28 have revealed four tev @xmath0-ray sources  @xcite : hess  j1801@xmath1233 , located along the northeastern boundary of w28 , and a complex of three sources , hess  j1800@xmath1240a , b , and c , located to the south , outside the radio boundary .",
    "the southern h.e.s.s .",
    "sources spatially correspond with molecular clouds whose distances are consistent with that of w28  @xcite , suggesting the possibility that their origins are due to runaway crs from the snr .",
    "thus , this region is one of the best sites to study cr diffusion .",
    "although @xcite detected only one source associated with hess  j1800@xmath1240b  in the first year of observations , there are two lat sources in the southern region listed in the second _ fermi_-lat catalog  ( 2fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the gev and tev emissions originate from crs escaping from w28 , we can constrain the diffusion coefficient of the particles in this region .    in this paper , we report a detailed analysis of the lat sources surrounding w28 , based on 4 years of data .",
    "first , we give a brief description of the observations and data selection in section  [ obs ] .",
    "the analysis procedure and results are presented in section  [ ana_res ] , along with the spectra of the lat sources .",
    "the discussion is given in section  [ discussion ] followed by conclusions in section  [ conclusion ] .",

    "the lat was operated in sky - survey mode nearly continuously . in this observing mode",
    ", the lat scans the whole sky every two orbits ( @xmath4  3  hr ) , obtaining complete sky coverage and approximately uniform exposure .",
    "we used the standard lat analysis software , _ sciencetools _ version v9r30 , publicly available from the _ fermi _ science support center ( fssc ) .",
    "we used the post - launch instrument response functions ( irfs ) p7v6",
    "@xcite and applied the following event selection criteria : ( 1 ) events should be classified as @xmath15source@xmath16 class , ( 2 ) the reconstructed zenith angles of the arrival direction of @xmath0 rays should be smaller than 100@xmath17 to minimize the contamination from earth - limb @xmath0-ray emission , and ( 3 ) only time intervals when the center of the lat field of view is within 52@xmath17 of the local zenith , are accepted to further reduce the contamination by earth s atmospheric emission .",
    "the @xmath0-ray burst grb  100826a  @xcite occurred within the region used for the analysis in this paper .",

    ", we set free the normalization and spectral index of a power - law model applied to the galactic diffuse emission and the locations and spectral normalizations of all 2fgl sources within @xmath20 of the direction of w28 .",
    "to represent the emission near source  w  more accurately , the spectral parameters of w28 , hess  j1800@xmath1240b  and 240c were also set free .",
    "all parameters of the sources beyond 4@xmath17 were fixed to the values in the 2fgl catalog .",
    "after the fit , the spectral parameters except for 240b and 240c were fixed to the values obtained in the above analysis .",
    "we used a uniform disk model as the spatial template of w28 , as in the 2fgl catalog .",
    "fitting the extension and position of w28 gave consistent results with those in the catalog .",
    "we substituted the h.e.s.s .",
    "significance map of hess  j1801@xmath1233  @xcite for the template and found that it can not represent the gev emission from w28 .",
    "we performed a series of maximum likelihood fits to investigate the gev morphology around w28 , adopting a power - law spectral form for all sources of interest .",
    "first , we added source  w  as a point source and varied its position . as a result , we obtained the resulting maximum likelihood value for three point sources composed by 240b , 240c , and source  w  ( @xmath21 ) with respect to that for the no - source hypothesis ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the likelihood ratio , @xmath23(@xmath24 ) ( 12 degrees of freedom ) of @xmath25  335 , was substantially better than that obtained for a model containing only the two point sources 240b and c , @xmath23(@xmath26 ) ( 8 degrees of freedom ) @xmath25  293 , where @xmath27 is the likelihood for the two sources with the optimized positions ( see table  [ morphology_result ] ) .",
    "we therefore concluded that source  w is significantly detected .",

    "then we added a point source at the peak of the tev emission 240a .",
    "the obtained likelihood ratio increased by @xmath4  29 , so we concluded that 240a is also significantly detected .",
    "in addition we substituted the four point sources model with a morphological model composed by source  w  in addition to the h.e.s.s .",

    "the map was divided into individual sources 240a , 240b , and 240c with separate spectral parameters whose boundaries were determined from the apparent tev morphology . for the latter we extracted the regions above 4@xmath28 to avoid the background fluctuations .",
    "the resulting maximum likelihood ratio of @xmath25  383 ( 11 degrees of freedom ) is larger than that of the four point sources model .",
    "thus , we concluded that the best - fit model for the gev emission is provided by including the h.e.s.s .",

    "source  w  is consistent with a newly detected point source . the upper limit on its radius , assuming a uniform disk spatial model , was 4@xmath30 at 68% confidence level .",

    "we found no other obvious multiwavelength counterparts to gev sources , such as pulsars and blazars , within the positional error radius of 0@xmath12054 at the 95% confidence region .",
    "we tested the possibility that source  w  is a background active galactic nucleus , such as a blazar , which typically has a longer variability time scale of the @xmath0-ray flux than a few months .",
    "although source  w  is not bright enough to investigate the variability on monthly time scales , we can expect that the test statistics ( ts ) of source w slowly increases each year if the source is steady .",
    "indeed , we found that its ts gradually increases with time .",
    "however , it remains possible that source  w  may be a @xmath0-ray blazar with repetitive yearly activity .",
    "we also could not exclude the possibility that source  w  is a @xmath0-ray pulsar due to the lack of photon statistics for a pulsation search .      for the spectral analysis of lat sources in this region , we used the maximum likelihood fit tool , gtlike .",
    "each source was modeled as a simple power - law function @xmath34 for the fit .",
    "the obtained spectral index of 2.77  @xmath29  0.06 and flux level for w28 were in agreement with the previous result reported by  @xcite , but the spectral energy distribution is not shown here because we focus on the sources near w28 .",
    "figure  [ spec ] shows the resulting spectral energy distribution for each source along with 68% confidence regions .",

    "measurements , while 240a has a slightly harder spectral index than the value of 2.55  @xmath29  0.18 found by h.e.s.s .",
    "thus , 240a is expected to have a spectral break in the gev to tev range . however ,",
    "a simple power - law spectrum with a lower flux and softer spectral index at the 1@xmath28 level away from the lat best - fit values is consistent with the h.e.s.s .",
    "this result is different from that presented in  @xcite where it was shown that 240a has a spectral break in the lat band .",
    "this might be caused by the difference in source extension or an improved understanding of the diffuse background models .",
    "source  w  also can be expected to have a spectral break in the gev to tev band from  figure [ spec](d ) .",
    "we fitted the lat spectrum with a power - law with an exponential cutoff .",
    "however , no clear evidence for a break was found from the gev data alone .",
    "we considered the systematic errors due to the extraction threshold of the h.e.s.s .",
    "significance map , the uncertainty of the gev @xmath0-ray morphology of w28 , the lat effective area , and the modeling of interstellar emission .",

    "the uncertainties in the lat effective area are 5% at 516  mev and 10% above 10  gev , linearly varying with the logarithm of energy between those values  @xcite .",
    "we estimated the systematic errors induced in the source flux by repeating the analysis with two sets of modified irfs where the effective area was scaled up and down by its uncertainty .    in order to evaluate the systematic uncertainties due to the interstellar emission model , we compared the results obtained using the standard model in section  [ image_ana ] with the results based on eight alternative interstellar emission models as performed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we varied some of the most important parameters of the interstellar emission models , namely the uniform spin temperature used to estimate the column densities of interstellar atomic hydrogen ( 150  k and 10@xmath35  k ) , the vertical height of the cr propagation halo ( 4  kpc and 10  kpc ) , the cr source distribution in the galaxy ( the pulsar distribution by @xcite and the snr distribution by @xcite ) .",
    "we replaced the standard isotropic background and galactic interstellar emission models with the alternative ones for the spectral analysis . in this procedure , we fixed the isotropic background spectrum while the normalization of the interstellar model components were left free .",
    "the combined systematic errors on the spectral indexes and the spectral shapes considering the above uncertainties are shown in table  [ spec_result ] and figure  [ spec ] , respectively .",
    "three gev @xmath0-ray sources are found to be spatially coincident with the tev sources hess  j1800@xmath1240a , 240b , and 240c .",
    "they are likely to be steady sources and overlap with molecular clouds .",
    "this suggests that the gev ",
    "tev @xmath0-ray emission may be produced by @xmath3 decay originating from the interaction between the clouds and crs which were accelerated in and escaped from the snr .",
    "alternatively , the three h.e.s.s .",
    "sources may be unrelated to w28 , but still close to the molecular clouds .",
    "since there is no clear tev counterpart to source  w , we will discuss its origin in the following subsection .",
    "first we consider whether the three h.e.s.s .",
    "sources may be explained by individual sources unrelated to the runaway crs from w28 .",
    "hess  j1800@xmath1240a  is coincident with two  regions , g6.1@xmath10.6  @xcite and g6.225@xmath10.569  @xcite , that contain young massive stars which might contribute to the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "240b is associated with the clouds containing the ultra - compact  region w28a2 , containing a massive star in a very young phase of evolution .",
    "w28a2 exhibits energetic bipolar molecular outflows  @xcite which arise from the accretion of matter by the progenitor star .",
    "@xcite  concluded that gev @xmath0-rays can be explained by @xmath3-decay and bremsstrahlung .",
    "the kinetic energy of the outflow is 3.5  @xmath5  10@xmath36  erg and the dynamical timescale is a few 10@xmath37  yr , with the matter density as high as 10@xmath38  @xmath39 @xcite , although there is no model to explain multi - tev particle acceleration in such  regions .",
    "240c is spatially coincident with the radio - faint snr g5.71@xmath10.08  @xcite , which was suggested to be interacting with a molecular cloud due to the detection of an oh maser  @xcite .",
    "its distance is estimated to be either 3.1 or 13.7  kpc based on the maser velocity .",
    "therefore , it is not conclusive that the origins of the h.e.s.s",
    ". sources are stellar objects , or otherwise unrelated to snr w28 .",
    "we now explore the possibility that the three h.e.s.s .",
    "sources are attributed to the @xmath3-decay @xmath0 rays from molecular clouds illuminated by the escaping particles accelerated in w28 .",
    "attempts to constrain the diffusion coefficient of the runaway crs have been made recently using the gev  tev spectrum of hess  j1800@xmath1240b  and the tev data with upper limits in the gev band  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the hard spectrum of the runaway crs might indicate a harder spectral index than 2.0 for the crs accelerated in w28 and it is suggested to be 1.7 based on the radio synchrotron spectrum  @xcite . non - linear shock modification caused by the efficient cr acceleration can produce such a hard spectrum  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the value of @xmath73 is also strongly dependent on assumptions about the evolution of the accelerator .",
    "if an snr continuously accelerates particles even after the free expansion phase , the spectral index of the escaped particles above the cutoff energy @xmath113 is @xmath59+@xmath73 .",
    "this is smaller by a factor of @xmath73/2 than in the case of an impulsive source  @xcite which is very similar to our assumption for w28 , i.e. , the value of @xmath73 becomes larger by a factor of 1.5 than our result .",
