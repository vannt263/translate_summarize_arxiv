    "several effective model and approximate calculations of qcd suggest the existence of the first - order phase boundary and the critical point at finite chemical potentials  @xcite .",
    "various observables , such as collective flows , particle ratios , moment of the distributions of conserved charges , have been measured at various incident energies to find evidences of a phase transition and a critical point  @xcite .",
    "particularly , we shall focus on the observation of collapse of directed flow by the star collaboration  @xcite , which might be a signal of a first - order phase transition at high baryon density region between hadronic matter and quark gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "the collective transverse flow  @xcite has been utilized to explore the properties of hot and dense matter , since it reflects the properties of the equation of state ( eos ) in the early stages of nuclear collisions  @xcite .",
    "the existence of bounce off , one of the collective flows , in heavy - ion collisions was first suggested in hydrodynamics  @xcite and examined in experiments at bevalac  @xcite at lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",
    "later , the presence of the softest point near the phase transition in the eos  @xcite was discussed as a signal for the first - order phase transition , where the softest point is a local minimum of the ratio of pressure to energy density @xmath2 as a function of energy density , leading to a small sound velocity defined by @xmath3 . in ref .",

    "considerations of heavy ion collisions at rhic energy have raised the question whether the physics of the often speculated first - order phase transition or the `` softest point '' should better be studied at moderate energies  @xcite in which the collapse of the directed flow at @xmath47 - 9 gev was speculated . presumably , the eos of baryon rich matter is the softest at moderate energy densities of a few gev/@xmath5",

    "the negative slope of @xmath8 , called the third flow  @xcite or the anti - flow of the nucleon  @xcite emerges as a consequence of a tilted ellipsoid with respect to the beam axis from which negative flow builds up if matter passes through the softening point .",
    "thus the collapse of the directed flow slope to a negative value might signal the first - order phase transition from hadron phase to quark - gluon phase , and was recently observed in the beam energy scan ( bes ) program performed at rhic  @xcite .",

    "note that such microscopic transport models do not show a negative slope of the proton @xmath8 at midrapidity at bombarding energies of @xmath10 gev  @xcite , and thus the negative slope of the proton @xmath8 at @xmath11 and 19.6 gev observed by the star collaboration  @xcite is incompatible with the predictions by the standard hadronic transport models .",
    "we also note that the hadronic transport model with momentum dependent mean field significantly improves the description of the directed flow data from e895  @xcite and na49 data  @xcite , but inclusion of the hadronic mean field does not lead to the negative proton @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this gives indirect evidence of the phase transition around such collision energies .",
    "the excitation function of the directed flow slope was investigated also in a transport + hydrodynamics hybrid approach  @xcite , where it was found that there is no sensitivity of the directed flow on the eos , and there is no minimum in the excitation function of the directed flow slope .",
    "in contrast , strong sensitivities of the directed flow to the eos are found in a three - fluid model  @xcite .",
    "the three - fluid calculations indicate that the crossover deconfinement transition is consistent with the directed flow data of energy range up to @xmath12 gev .",
    "however , the phsd transport model which incorporates crossover eos does not show the experimentally observed minimum  @xcite .",
    "thus it is not yet clear whether the negative slope of @xmath8 signals the softening of the eos in hybrid approaches .    in the present paper , we investigate the directed flow in the bes energy region within the microscopic transport model jam  @xcite by imposing attractive orbits for each two - body scattering to simulate effects of a softening of the eos .",

    "the pressure of a system , in which particles are interacting with each other only by two - body scattering , is given by the virial theorem as  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 corresponds to the free streaming contribution .",
    "the second term represents the pressure generation from all two - body scatterings between the pair of particles @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the momentum transfer and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the coordinate of colliding particles .",
    "@xmath21 is the volume of the system , and @xmath22 is a time interval over which the system is measured .",
    "thus , pressure generation by the two - body collisions is related to the scattering style ; the repulsive orbit @xmath23 enhances the pressure , while the attractive orbit @xmath24 reduces the pressure .",
    "note that an attractive potential softens the eos  @xcite , which leads to an attractive orbit .",
    "attractive orbits are realized in the simulation as follows .",
    "each orbit is selected randomly as in the standard simulation , but in the case where the orbit is repulsive , we change it to an attractive one by exchanging the momentum of two particles in the two - body cener - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "thus the scattering rate remains the same . while in reality modification of the scattering style",
    "should depend for example , on variables such as local energy density , we impose a modified scattering style for all hadron - hadron @xmath25 scatterings in order to see an effect of the softening , instead of trying to fit the data .",

    "which part of the eos is responsible for the collapse of proton directed flow in the next sections .",

    ", width=302 ]    in the jam cascade with attractive orbits , on the other hand , it is observed that directed flow is strongly modified to be negative by the reduction of pressure at early times , especially at lower energies , and directed flow always increases as a function of reaction time .",
    "we note that the slope of directed flow stays negative also in the rescattering stages of the reaction ; the period long after two nuclei pass through each other . as expected ,",
    "directed flow becomes smaller as collision energy becomes higher , due to less interaction time  @xcite .",
    "the range of beam energies covered by bes is quite interesting .",

    "thus , hadronic rescatterings start in au+au collisions before passing through two nuclei at @xmath54 gev , because crossing time is much longer than the hadronization time from string fragmentation which is typically 1 fm/@xmath65 .",
    "on the other hand , at @xmath29 gev , most of the hadronic rescattering among produced particles occur after two nuclei pass through each other . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a wiggle structure in the rapidity dependence of proton directed flow was predicted at @xmath67 gev in which initial nucleon - nucleon collisions are well isolated from the late hadronic rescatterings , and it is argued that a wiggle structure appears as a result of the correlation between the position of a nucleon and its stopping power due to initial glauber type nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the negative directed flow seen in the hadronic transport models at @xmath29 gev is due to the same reason . at energies @xmath68 gev ,",

    "thus it is an interesting question whether dynamical model calculations with the eos softening can describe the observed nonmonotonic behavior of cumulant ratios  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that jam with attractive orbits as well as nuclear mean - field effects does not describe the observed large enhancement of cumulant ratios  @xcite .",
    "so far , we implement attractive orbits in jam for all hadron - hadron @xmath25 scatterings without any restrictions . as a result ,",
    "our equation of state is soft for all energy densities as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eosatt ] .",
    "we now explore the eos dependence of the directed flow . for this purpose , instead of imposing attractive scattering all the way , we select attractive orbits at each two - body scattering with the probability @xmath82 given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a pressure as a function of energy density @xmath55 from a given eos , and @xmath39 is the local pressure at the collision point computed from the energy - momentum tensor as in sec .",
    "[ sec : eos ] .",
    "the qcd equation of state at high baryon densities is not well understood . as a first step ,",
    "we use the eos which does not depend on baryon density for simplicity , since our purpose here is to check the systematics of our approach that modifies the scattering style .",
    "we test the eos with crossover from lattice qcd ( @xmath85-v1.1 ) taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , and the eos with a first - order phase transition similar to that of eos - q with the modification of the slope in the qgp phase to @xmath86 ( instead of the massless ideal gas eos @xmath87 ) so that pressure at high energy densities is consistent with the lattice eos as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : jameos ] .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : jameos ] the results which are extracted from jam simulations to ensure that our simple approach is consistent with a given eos .",
    "it is seen that our simple approach works very well to modify the eos of the system .         for protons and pions in semicentral au+au collisions for @xmath11 gev from jam simulations with different eos .",
    "the solid line presents the jam result with the eos with fist - order phase transition , and the dashed line presents the jam result with the crossover eos .",
    "the dotted line is for the standard jam result.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1eos ] , we plot the rapidity dependence of the directed flow of protons ( upper panel ) and pions ( lower panel ) in au+au semicentral collision at @xmath11 gev obtained from the eos with crossover and first - order phase transition .",
    "while pion flow is not sensitive to the eos , one sees that both eoss yield the suppression of proton directed flow compared to the standard cascade simulation , since both eoss are softer than the effective eos from the standard jam cascade simulation as compared in fig .  [ fig : v1eos ] .",
    "proton flow at midrapidity @xmath88 is not sensitive to the eos , but two eos give different behavior for larger rapidities indicating that the softening point of the current eos is responsible to the rapidity @xmath89 at @xmath11 gev , and explicit eos dependence of the directed flow may be observable in the experiments .",
    "it remains for further work to establish the eos dependence of the directed flow by utilizing a fully baryon density dependent eos .",
    "the interactions used here do not employ any baryon density dependent interactions , @xmath90 , as one may want to use in relativistic mean - field models of high baryon density matter .",
    "it is also possible that @xmath91 matter with slightly nonuniversal scalar attraction can easily cause a first - order phase transition without mentioning any high baryon density qcd .",
    "we will present a detailed systematic study of the eos dependence of the directed flow elsewhere .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the effect of the softening of the eos on the directed flow of protons and pions within a microscopic transport approach .",
    "the transport model jam with standard stochastic two - body scattering style predicts the large positive slope of proton @xmath8 at collision energy below @xmath92 gev , and the negative slope of proton @xmath8 only at higher collision energy @xmath93 gev , which disagree with the star data .",
    "however , softening effects of the eos simulated by attractive orbit scatterings lead to a dramatic change in the dynamics , and yield significant reduction of proton @xmath8 which well describe the star data around the minimum of @xmath6 at @xmath94 gev .",
    "the softening effects were not needed in the present approach at lower energies , @xmath32 .",
    "we found that attractive orbit scattering style does not modify elliptic flow at mid - rapidity .",
    "we show that this softening effect is needed only at early stages of the reaction where the system reaches the high baryon density state at midrapidity .",
    "we also proposed a simple recipe to simulate a given eos within a hadronic transport model , and compared two different eos .",
    "we saw an eos dependence of the proton directed flow in the forward rapidities .",
    "more detailed systematic studies are needed , using a fully baryon density dependent eos , in order to draw a conclusion that the minimum of @xmath6 is a result of the softening of the eos which may be caused by a first - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "a possible scenario to fully explain the beam energy dependence of the directed flow may be described as follows .",
    "we assume that there exists the softest point in the energy density range reachable at @xmath95 .",
    "hadrons will feel an attractive force when they go across the surface of the soft region .",
    "this additional force can be simulated by introducing the attractive orbit scatterings among hadrons , as we have demonstrated in the present work , and negative @xmath6 emerges . one may need to introduce new degrees of freedom other than hadrons to understand the rehardening at higher energies .",
    "it seems obvious to infer a softening of the eos from the experimentally observed collapse of net - proton flow when the c.m .",
    "energy is increased from 7 to 11 gev .",
    "however , the statement of a discovery of the `` softening '' of the eos from the net - proton @xmath8 data shows even more convincing evidence for the `` phase transition '' as we observe the rebound at higher energies ; namely the star - observed second change of sign of the @xmath8 values of the net protons at @xmath96 gev back to positive @xmath8 at higher energies  @xcite .",
    "this shows that the soft region is overcome , and the directed flow picks up steam again , due to the rehardening of the eos at considerably larger energy densities .",
    "in the near future , a more detailed analysis of the softening effect should be addressed by employing a realistic eos which is consistent with the lattice qcd result .",
    "because of the nonequilibrium evolution , the pressure generation due to the two - body collision @xmath44 depends in the current study not only on the difference between the equilibrium eoss , but also on the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "perhaps a more justified way of fixing the eos would be to look at a fully equilibrated system in a box , and then determine the probabilities for attractive orbits as a function of the energy of the colliding particles , so that a given ( equilibrium ) eos would be reproduced ; then the microscopic dynamics would tell how the system looks in out - of - equilibrium situations .",
    "it is expected that properties of the eos at high baryon density may be probed sensitively by using the flow .",
    "future experiments such as the bes ii at rhic  @xcite , fair  @xcite , nica  @xcite , and j - parc  @xcite should clarify this point at lower collision energies @xmath97 gev .",
