    "extreme events play an important part in many areas of physics . in turbulence",
    "they determine the non - gaissian statistics of the tails of the probability distribution functions for the properties of random flow @xcite and in the linear theory of random wave localization the momenta non - selfaveraging quantities , like e.g. wave transmissivity are determined by rare non - typical realizations rather than the typical ( localized ) ones @xcite .    in the context of the nonlinear optics",
    "the study of the extreme events has recently drawn attention in the context of the _ optical rogue waves _",
    "@xcite - emerging dynamical objects of very high amplitude and short lifetime .",
    "closely related topics are extreme statistics in raman amplification @xcite and the _ supercontinuum generation _ @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the rogue waves in optical fibers is not necessarily a nonlinear effect and can be observed in the linear regime as well @xcite .",
    "finally the statistics of rare events ( extreme outages ) also determines the probability of errors in fiber optical communications with distributed amplifier spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "most of the applications above pertain to the field of nonlinear fiber optics . here",
    "we study the emergence of the high power optical pulses in the context of the nonlinear hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) interferometry .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explain theoretically recent experimental results reported in ref.@xcite on the non - exponential distribution of the intensity distributions of disordered optical field propagating in nonlinear bulk waveguides .",
    "the linear hbt method was first proposed in 1950s in astronomy as a means of measuring a size of a distance light source ( e.g. a star ) by measuring the _ intensity correlation radius _ of the received light @xcite .",
    "the latter is the the typical size of an optical _ speckle _",
    "( i.e. bright area ) observed when multiple waves emitted from a thermal source interfere constructively @xcite .",
    "the problem allows classical treatment and when the propagation is linear one can infer that at a distance @xmath0 from a source of diameter @xmath1 the size of the speckle @xmath2 is given by a simple relation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wavelength of emitted light @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite was the first publication to our knowledge where the hbt interferometry in _ nonlinear light _ propagation and the resulting speckle distribution were studied in bulk algaas waveguides .",
    "the system is effectively described by the nonlinear schrodinger equation ( nlse ) which paves the way to application of the nonlinear hbt interferometry not only in the field of optics but weakly interacting bose - einstein condensates as well @xcite .",
    "two principal findings of ref .",
    "@xcite were that the tail of the intensity distribution , @xmath5 , of the speckled field is non - exponential ( unlike in a linear diffraction @xcite ) and the intensity correlation radius ( speckle size ) depends on the magnitude of the focusing nonlinearity .",
    "the first observation signifies the fact that the statistics of the optical filed after the nonlinear propagation is no longer gaussian ( or , equivalently , the amplitude of the field no longer follows the rayleigh distribution ) .",
    "this effect is also known to occur in linear systems when a linear wave propagates through a disordered media @xcite",
    ". here however we deal with a different type of setup where not only is the non - linearity present but also disorder is only in the initial conditions ( incident beam ) and not in the media itself . for the focusing nonlinearity in an important 2d configuration of the system ( commonly known as 1 + 1 geometry ) this phenomenon",
    "was correctly attributed by the authors of ref.@xcite to generation of _ bright spatial soliton _",
    "beamlets @xcite that now play the role of observed speckles .",
    "the tails of the intensity distribution are determined by extremely rare events when an extremely high power ( and narrow width ) soliton is born from a random beam of a finite waist and intensity .",
    "our paper seeks to explain theoretically the profile and shape of the tails of the intensity probability density functions ( pdfs ) in the 1 + 1 geometry using the inverse scattering technique ( ist ) for the nlse @xcite .",
    "we first construct a semi - empirical theory of a hbt interferometer in the high - power regime where the field is dominated by its soliton component .",
    "this theory is later corroborated by the results obtained analytically from the ist in the limit of short correlated source field .",
    "as for the dependence of the intensity correlation radius on the magnitude of nonlinearity observed in @xcite this is of course to be expected in the nonlinear system .",
    "here we also supply a simple theoretical result for the average speckle size @xmath2 in the same short - correlated source limit , and derive theoretically the linear scaling of its inverse , @xmath6 , with the average intensity @xmath7 of the source ( or , equivalently , with the nonlinear coefficient ) .",
    "we also provide theoretical results in the case of de - focusing nonlinearity where no bright solitons are observed . in all cases",
    "we perform full numerical simulations using the parameters close to those used in the experimental setup of ref.@xcite to confirm our analytical predictions .",
    "note that the propagation of incoherent fields in nonlinear optics has been studied previously in various contexts ( see e.g. refs .",
    "however most of the systems considered usually rely on more complicated non - local or non - instantaneous models and the quantities calculated are usually not particularly relevant for the hbt problem .",
    "the local 1 + 1 nlse is the simplest model where one can get both a clear physical understanding of how the nonlinearity affects hbt interferometry and obtain some analytical results .",
    "similar problem statement occurs in the context of fiber optics ref.@xcite , where the formation of bright solitons from a disordered input was employed to illustrate the concept of _ soliton discriminator _ as a means of nonlinear optical regeneration .",
    "however in @xcite as opposed to the current paper an opposite regime was addressed where the emergence of a soliton from a disordered output has a relatively small probability and neither the intensity distribution nor the correlation function of the output were studied .",
    "the dynamics of beam propagation along the direction of @xmath8 axis in the presence of diffraction and nonlinearity is given by the nonlinear schrodinger equation ( nlse ) @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electrical field , @xmath11 is the spatial transverse coordinate , @xmath12 is the propagation constant , @xmath13 is the linear refractive index and @xmath14 is the nonlinear coefficient of the medium . here",
    "we will consider both attractive ( @xmath15 ) and repulsive ( @xmath16 ) cases .",
    "we will also be using dimensionless soliton units @xmath17 , where @xmath1 is some characteristic width , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the diffraction length ( rayleigh range ) and @xmath20 is the dimensionless field @xmath21 , @xmath22 . then in new dimensionless units we will have @xmath23    when choosing the model for random disordered input we opt for the form which mimics as close as possible the experimental setup and simulation data from ref.@xcite .",
    "the physical input is defined by two parameters : the initial speckle size @xmath24 and the aperture @xmath1 ( we also pick the latter as the normalization width for the soliton units above ) . in our numerical simulations",
    "the spatial resolution @xmath25 is determined according to @xmath24 to insure sufficient sampling and the width of computational domain @xmath26 is set large enough to prevent folding during the propagation .",
    "the input disordered field is modeled in fourier space by @xmath27 random low frequency modes , where @xmath28 . as for the complex amplitudes of these random modes , @xmath29",
    ", we assume that these form a set of of independent identical random variables each having a uniformly distributed phase and the amplitude sampled from a distribution with the average intensity @xmath30 .",
    "this pattern is then filtered by the finite aperture @xmath1 to manifest the disordered field at the input facet of the nonlinear waveguide .",
    "as the number of modes is large the central limit theorem applies so that the field above , @xmath31 , can be considered gaussian with zero mean and the correlation function : @xmath32}{\\sin \\left[\\pi(x - x')/l'\\right]}\\ ] ] the field is of course non - zero only in the aperture window @xmath33 $ ] so the formula above applies only to this region .",
    "the averaged initial intensity is then @xmath34 .",
    "also when @xmath24 is the smallest length scale in the problem we will be using the delta - correlated approximation when the r.h.s . of eq.([correl - init",
    "] ) is substituted with @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "this makes further analytical treatment possible in some cases and we will often use it in the paper .    as for the intensity distribution , @xmath5 ,",
    "since the initial field is gaussian the statistics of the propagated field in the linear case ( @xmath37 ) will remain gaussian .",
    "as the intensity is the modulus squared of the complex gaussian variate its normalized value @xmath38 has an exponential distribution , the fact which is well known in the linear theory of speckle spectra @xcite . our main task in the subsequent sections will be to determine the modified shapes of the intensity distribution @xmath5 in the presence of nonlinearity . of particular interest is the high intensity tail of this distribution determined by rare fluctuations leading to the field bursts .",
    "let us consider the case of focusing ( @xmath15 ) nlse",
    ". then it is known that given enough initial power an arbitrary initial condition @xmath31 evolves into the combination of hyperbolic secant constituents ( each corresponding to an individual bright soliton ) and quasilinear radiation @xcite . here we will adopt a phenomenological description of the intensity distribution and the correlation properties of the output field based on the prescribed form of the solution as the sum of statistically independent soliton pulse shapes with prescribed statistical properties .    a single soliton solution of ( [ nlse ] ) in soliton units is given by : @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\exp \\left[-i(2\\,v\\,\\xi+2\\tau(v^2-\\eta^2)-\\phi)\\right ] \\label{one - sol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 are related to the soliton s amplitude , @xmath42 , and ` velocity ' ( i.e. the angle of incidence , @xmath43 ) , while the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the soliton s initial position and global phase .",
    "the total power of an individual soliton ( or rather its transversal part in the @xmath11-plane ) @xmath46 is simply proportional to its amplitude : @xmath47 .",
    "the justification for this approach is presented in the following chapter [ sec : ist ] where more rigorous ist based analysis is performed .",
    "it is these soliton constituents that contribute to the tails of intensity distribution @xmath5 as the linear radiation quickly disperses away from the aperture .",
    "let us now assume the regime where the density of solitons is not too high so that the average minimal distance between the solitons is larger than the average width of a soliton  a regime that can be called an asymptotically free regime",
    ". then each soliton contributes independently into the intensity distribution ( the interference effects are neglected ) and we may consider a contribution from each individual soliton separately . for a single soliton solution of the nlse ( [ nlse0 ] ) in the real world",
    "units the intensity at a given point @xmath11 is given by : @xmath48 , \\label{intens}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the amplitude of the soliton in the dimensionless soliton units , @xmath50 is its velocity and @xmath51 is the intial position of the soliton center ( in @xmath52 m ) . as the input is random",
    "the amplitude , velocity and the initial position of the soliton are also random variables . as for their joint probability density function @xmath53 we shall make an assumption which is supported both by numerical simulations and the following zakharov - shabat eigenvalue analysis ( see below ) .",
    "namely we assume that soliton velocity parameter @xmath41 is independent from the other variables and its distribution is uniform over a symmetric interval @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "this immediately means that for a soliton emitted from the origin the position shift due to the fluctuating velocity is also a uniformly distributed random variable in the interval @xmath55 $ ] , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the propagation distance in soliton units .",
    "the conditional probability density of having the value of intensity in the vicinity of @xmath58 given the amplitude of the soliton , @xmath59 , is then given by @xmath60 \\",
    "\\right \\rangle \\label{p - i - eta0}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is given by eq.([intens ] ) and the angular brackets denote additional averaging with respect to the marginal pdf of the initial positions @xmath62 .    in order to perform",
    "the averaging analytically we will only consider the high intensity tails of the pdf when the typical soliton width , @xmath63 is much more narrow than the width of position distribution , @xmath64 .",
    "additionally we will assume that the propagation distance @xmath65 is large enough so @xmath66 , and therefore the fluctuations in the soliton initial position , @xmath51 , are negligible when compared to these due to the random velocity @xmath50 .",
    "after all these assumptions the result of integration ( [ p - i - eta0 ] ) can be presented as @xmath67 , \\ , |x| < \\tilde \\delta/2 \\label{p - i - eta}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 $ ]",
    ".    if the number of produced solitons is @xmath70 then it is relatively straightforward to derive the average minimal distance between the neighbouring solitons which is given by @xmath71 .",
    "as we have assumed that the width of each soliton is much more narrow than the average minimal inter - soliton distance this implies that the condition for the amplitude is in fact @xmath72 .    finally to get the marginal intensity distribution",
    "@xmath5 we need to average eq.([p - i - eta ] ) over all realizations of soliton amplitude @xmath49 . assuming that the marginal pdf @xmath73 is known and is the same for all realizations with different soliton numbers the result reads : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and factor @xmath76 takes into account that for each realization all @xmath77 solitons contribute equally and independently into the intensity and we neglect the effects of interference and soliton collisions ( i.e. overlap ) .",
    "many properties of the evolving solution of nlse ( [ nlse ] ) , including the number of emerging solitons , their amplitudes , energies and velocities can be established by means of so called zakharov - shabat spectral problem ( zssp ) @xcite : @xmath78 here the complex initial field @xmath79 plays the role of the `` potential '' while the complex eigenvalues @xmath80 can have both discrete and continuous values .",
    "it is the discrete spectrum @xmath81 which determines the soliton part of the solution and in the case of a single soliton solution the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath40 are are exactly the ones featured in eq .",
    "( [ one - sol ] ) .",
    ".[tab:1 ] the main parameters of the simulations for the focusing case [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     although in the real experiments the pulse attenuation was quite high at the length scale considered we can still use these parameters for illustrative purposes . in our simulations we assumed a fixed averaged value of the input power , @xmath82w , which correspond to the effective nonlinear length @xmath83 mm .",
    "the simulations were performed for three values of the propagation distance @xmath8 comparable to the nonlinear length .",
    "the results are given in fig.[fig : defocus ]     ( color online ) the pdf of the self - similar variable @xmath84 for different values of the propagation distance . ]",
    "one can clearly see that depending on the propagation distance @xmath8 there are two regimes with two types of statistics .",
    "when the propagation distance is less than the nonlinear length , @xmath85 , the nonlinear term in eq.([nlse ] ) can be neglected , i.e. the propagation is linear and as mentioned before the intensity pdf is exponential .",
    "it easy to check that in terms of the self - similar variable @xmath84 the linear pdf is @xmath86 when the distance exceeds the nonlinear length the far - field asymptotes ( [ p - i ] ) and ( [ p - i1 ] ) hold and the shape of the pdf @xmath87 becomes universal ( with the gaussian tails ) .",
    "the intermediate values of the propagation distance fill the gap between the two limiting distributions ( as clearly seen in fig.[fig : defocus ] ) .",
    "to conclude , we have studied both analytically and numerically the statistics of the intensity distribution of a disordered short - correlated pulse propagating in nonlinear media under conditions close to those experimentally observed in ref.@xcite . in the limit of the delta - correlated pulse , when the initial correlation length ( speckle size ) is much less than the aperture size we provide analytical expressions for the intensity distribution for both focusing and defocusing media .",
    "it turns out that the power - law tails reported in @xcite are not universal and represent an approximate fit to a transitional area followed by an exponential asymptote in the focusing case and gaussian asymptote in the de - focusing case . for the latter a universal analytical formula for the intensity pdf",
    "is given in the regime when the propagation length ( the length of the beam ) is larger than the nonlinear length .",
    "also in the focusing case a simple expression is given for the intensity correlation width , @xmath2 ( formula ( [ scaling ] ) ) which relates it to the initial correlation width ( speckle size ) , @xmath24 and the average intensity of the source @xmath7 confirming the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "this formula supplements the relation @xmath88 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using quantitative arguments and thus allows one to estimate not only the linear size of the object , @xmath1 , but also its average intensity @xmath7 and a correlation radius @xmath24 ( or rather the product of the two ) when the system is in a soliton regime ( high power , high number of speckle beamlets ) .",
    "we would like to thank yaron silberberg for drawing our attention to the problem and ehud altman for stimulating discussions .",
    "sd would like to thank the department of physics of complex systems at weizmann institute of science for its warm hospitality .",
    "for a single soliton with the intensity profile ( [ intens ] ) and the uniform position distribution it is possible to calculate the intensity correlation function @xmath89 provided that the typical soliton amplitude , @xmath90 is much greater than the ratio @xmath91 , i.e. all typical soliton pulse realisations ( as well as the correlation function itself ) have the width much less than the size of the region where soliton are eventually distributed , @xmath92 .",
    "then one obtains @xmath93 and @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "so for the one - soliton correlation function we obtain @xmath97 where the averaging in the r.h.s .",
    "is performed over the amplitude distribution .",
    "the relative strength of intensity fluctuations for one soliton is given by @xmath98    next , let us consider a train of @xmath77 solitons with statistically independent parameters and random , uniform phases .",
    "first we consider realizations where exactly @xmath77-solitons are created .",
    "then we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a single - soliton field ( [ one - sol ] ) in the real world units . performing additional averaging over all realizations with different number of solitons as well as over the spatial coordinate @xmath11 ( denoted by an overbar ) we arrive at : @xmath102 again",
