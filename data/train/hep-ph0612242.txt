    "the physics responsible for the breaking of electroweak symmetry will be studied at the lhc over the next few years . in anticipation of potentially definitive experimental results ,",
    "a number of novel models of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) have been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "these models aim , in part , to address the hierarchy problem that is inherent to the higgs sector of the minimal standard model , while satisfying the constraints posed by lep data .",
    "long ago , technicolor models were proposed as an alternative to the minimal higgs sector @xcite . fermions coupling both to the electroweak and technicolor gauge sectors condense when the technicolor interactions become strong .",
    "the fermion condensate takes the place of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field in the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "the hierarchy problem associated with radiative corrections to the higgs mass is eliminated since no fundamental scalar fields are present in the theory .",
    "the large separation between the planck and electroweak scales is understood as a natural consequence of the logarithmic running of the technicolor gauge coupling .",
    "unfortunately , it was realized in the last millennium that technicolor models predict large corrections to precisely measured electroweak observables if the new strong sector is similar to qcd  @xcite . in particular , the peskin - takeuchi oblique parameter @xmath0 is predicted to be @xmath1 , while experiments constrain @xmath0 to be less than about @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "more recently , technicolor models with small or negative values of @xmath0 have been constructed using the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . in this holographic approach ,",
    "the dynamics of the strongly coupled sector is not necessarily specified _ a priori_. instead , a five - dimensional ( 5d ) gauge theory in a warped background is postulated to define a strongly coupled four - dimensional ( 4d ) technicolor sector via the rules of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . beginning with a holographic theory that has properties similar to qcd , new couplings are introduced in the 5d model that alter the holographic prediction of current - current correlation functions in the strongly - coupled theory .",
    "it can then be shown that the parameter space of the 5d theory contains regions where the value of the @xmath0 parameter is in accord with experimental constraints  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we also use the freedom to deviate from a qcd - like holographic theory in constructing a viable model of dynamical ewsb .",
    "in particular , we will allow for a separation of the technicolor confinement and chiral symmetry breaking scales as another means for reducing the @xmath0-parameter .    a complete model of holographic technicolor",
    "must also provide a mechanism for generating standard model fermion masses .",
    "four - dimensional extended technicolor ( etc ) models provide the desired coupling between standard model fermions and the technicolor condensate through four - fermion operators that are generated when heavy etc gauge bosons are integrated out of the theory  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , etc gauge boson exchange generically produces flavor - changing four - fermion operators that are excluded by experiment , if the etc scale is low enough to account for a heavy top quark .",
    "an alternative means of generating fermion masses is possible in technicolor theories that have an additional , possibly composite , higgs doublet field in the low - energy theory  @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the technifermion condensate to this field forces it to develop a vev , even if the higgs mass squared is positive .",
    "yukawa couplings of the higgs field then provide the origin of standard model fermion masses . if the higgs field is composite , we assume that the compositeness scale is higher than the technicolor scale , so that the higgs may be treated as a new fundamental scalar in the low - energy effective theory . while it may seem unusual to consider electroweak symmetry breaking models with fundamental scalars , viable strongly coupled extended technicolor sectors that suppress flavor changing operators often have scalars in their effective description below the etc scale @xcite .",
    "the basic features of this  bosonic technicolor \" scenario are reviewed in section  [ sec:4dmodel ] .    in this paper",
    ", we present a bosonic technicolor model in which the dynamics of the strongly coupled sector is defined through its holographic dual .",
    "the model is compatible with electroweak constraints and provides for the origin of fermion masses .",
    "coefficients in the electroweak chiral lagrangian of the theory , that would otherwise be unknown , are determined by the ads / cft correspondence , as we discuss in section  [ sec : adscft ] .",
    "we then study the phenomenology of the model in section  [ sec : pheno ] .",
    "in particular , we compute the usually problematic contribution to the @xmath0 parameter , as a function of the technirho mass and the vev of the higgs field , and find that a significant region of parameter space is allowed .",
    "we also study the decays of the technirho which , if observed at the lhc , could exclude regions of the model s parameter space and potentially discriminate between different holographic technicolor scenarios . neither the @xmath0 parameter nor the partial decay widths of the technicolor resonances were calculable in earlier versions of bosonic technicolor .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the gauge group of the model is @xmath3su(3)@xmath4 su(2)@xmath5u(1)@xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents the technicolor group .",
    "we will assume that @xmath7 is asymptotically free and confining , but make no other assumptions about the group .",
    "we assume two flavors of technifermions , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which transform in a nontrivial representation of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , these fields form a left - handed su(2)@xmath10 doublet and two right - handed singlets @xmath11 with hypercharges @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . with these assignments ,",
    "the technicolor sector is free of gauge anomalies .",
    "the technicolor sector has a global su(2)@xmath15su(2)@xmath16 symmetry , which corresponds to independent special unitary rotations on the left- and right - handed technifermion fields .",
    "it is assumed that strong dynamics results in a technifermion condensate @xmath17 that spontaneously breaks this symmetry . here",
    ", @xmath18 is traditionally identified as the chiral symmetry breaking scale  @xcite .",
    "the resulting goldstone bosons may be described in an effective chiral lagrangian , where @xmath19 and where the @xmath20 field transforms simply under the su(2)@xmath15su(2)@xmath16 symmetry : @xmath21 a kinetic term for @xmath20 may be constructed that is invariant under eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigtrans ] ) , and also under the standard model gauge symmetries , @xmath22 where the covariant derivative is given by @xmath23 here , the @xmath24 are the generators of su(2 ) , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings , respectively .",
    "the quadratic terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kin1 ] ) include mixing between gauge fields and the pion fields , indicating that the latter are unphysical and can be gauged away .",
    "after doing so , the remaining quadratic terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kin1 ] ) give the gauge boson masses , @xmath27 which reproduce the correct experimental values for @xmath28  gev .",
    "for @xmath29 , the theory described thus far corresponds to conventional technicolor , with all its well - known problems .",
    "large contributions to the @xmath0 parameter will be avoided in our case by deforming the model away from one that could be naively interpreted as a scaled - up version of qcd .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section . here , we extend the model to provide for an origin of fermion masses .",
    "we assume that the low - energy theory includes a scalar su(2)@xmath10 doublet @xmath30 that can couple to the technifermions and to standard model fermions via ordinary yukawa couplings : @xmath31 @xmath32 we will _ not _ assume that @xmath33 has a negative squared mass .",
    "the yukawa coupling of @xmath33 to the technifermions produces a @xmath33 tadpole term when the chiral symmetry is dynamically broken and the technifermions condense .",
    "this guarantees that there is a non - zero vacuum expectation value for @xmath33 , and hence , that masses for the standard model fermions are generated .",
    "the origin of the @xmath33 doublet is worthy of some comment .",
    "the @xmath33 field either represents a fundamental particle in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , or a composite one in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "each possibility presents its own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "if @xmath33 is fundamental , then an ultraviolet completion that separately solves the hierarchy problem , such as supersymmetry , must be assumed .",
    "some may object to such a hybrid proposal on philosophical grounds , but such arguments have little bearing on whether or not such a theory is realized in nature . on the other hand , if @xmath33 is composite , one avoids the problems of quadratic divergences , which are regulated by the higgs compositeness scale . in this case , however , other difficulties may occur .",
    "the couplings of the composite field to the fundamental fermions in the theory arise via higher - dimension operators , leading to suppression factors .",
    "one might worry that the top quark yukawa coupling could be too small in a generic model of this sort , though such an outcome could be avoided , for example , if the third generation fermions are also composite .",
    "a higgs compositeness sector may also provide a new source for dangerous flavor - changing neutral current effects , via higher - dimension operators suppressed by the higgs compositeness scale .",
    "whether such problems actually do arise , however , depends on the details of the theory in the uv , which are unknown .",
    "since we work exclusively with the low - energy theory , it is only necessary that we assume that some adequate uv completion of our model exists .",
    "the same assumption is made in other popular models of ewsb  @xcite .",
    "we should also comment on naturalness of bosonic technicolor models .",
    "we assume that the scalar field in the effective low - energy lagrangian has a positive squared mass .",
    "the scalar mass can not be arbitrarily large , or else the scalar vacuum expectation value would not be large enough to account for fermion masses with perturbative yukawa couplings .",
    "therefore , the scalar sector of bosonic technicolor is comparable in naturalness to the higgs sector of the standard model .",
    "we always assume that if bosonic technicolor is realized in nature , then it is the low - energy effective description of a theory in which the scalar mass is stabilized by some additional mechanism .",
    "we stress that our purpose is not to solve the hierarchy problem , but to study the phenomenology of this class of electroweak symmetry breaking models .",
    "we may incorporate @xmath33 into the chiral lagrangian by defining the matrix field @xmath34 which transforms precisely in the same way as @xmath20 under the chiral symmetry .",
    "for the case in which the technifermions have a common yukawa coupling @xmath35 , which we assume henceforth , the @xmath33 tadpole described above appears through the following term in the effective chiral lagrangian  @xcite @xmath36 the coefficient has been chosen such that @xmath37 is of order unity by naive dimensional analysis ( at least in qcd - like models )  @xcite .",
    "it is now convenient to employ a nonlinear representation of the @xmath38 field , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a vev and @xmath41 is defined in analogy to eq .",

    "the @xmath47 and @xmath40 vevs , as well as the mass of the @xmath48 field , can be determined in terms of the tadpole parameter @xmath37 in eq .",

    "the condensation of a fermion bilinear operator could provide a simple mechanism for the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "nature provides an example of this mechanism in qcd : a quark condensate spontaneously breaks the global chiral symmetries of the theory , leading to the observed spectrum of pseudogoldstone bosons .",
    "although the analogy to qcd is a source of inspiration for theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking , it has also presented a challenge .",
    "a technicolor sector that is simply a scaled - up version of qcd produces a significant positive contribution to the electroweak @xmath0 parameter , leading to results that are in conflict with current experimental bounds .",
    "there is no reason to believe _ a priori _ that nature should choose a technicolor sector that can be compared so easily to qcd .",
    "since the technicolor gauge coupling is nonperturbative at the electroweak scale , however , alternative models have proved difficult to study . in the absence of simple scaling arguments that start with known results from hadronic physics , one in the past",
    "could only make the polite observation that the @xmath0 parameter might not be a problem in all models .",
    "the low - energy spectrum and dynamics of any specific proposal could not be determined with any degree of certainty .",
    "holography presents a way around this impasse by allowing one to work instead with an equivalent higher - dimensional theory that is weakly coupled .",
    "we have studied in this work a technicolor sector that is defined entirely in terms of its five - dimensional holographic dual , allowing us to deviate in a calculable way from the qcd - like limit .",
    "we have shown that appropriate choices of the parameters in the 5d theory exist where the otherwise leading contribution to the @xmath0 parameter is small .",
    "separation of the confining and chiral symmetry breaking scales in the holographic approach is possible ( although there is not necessarily a simple 4d gauge theory description of such a theory ) , and provides a mechanism for reducing the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "we take this approach for simplicity , not out of necessity .",
    "the main issue that we address is the generation of fermion masses .",
    "we have added to the theory a ( possibly composite ) weak doublet field , whose vev is shifted from zero via its coupling to the technifermion condensate . like a conventional higgs doublet , the new field has yukawa couplings to the standard model fermions , allowing their masses to be generated .",
    "notably , the squared mass of the scalar is taken to be positive in our model , so that it is not the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking by itself .",
    "the inclusion of this additional scalar doublet in our theory is not a radical proposition .",
    "it has been known for some time that models with strongly - coupled extended technicolor sectors can produce exactly this low - energy particle spectrum  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a holographic representation of a strongly - coupled etc theory in which low energy properties of the theory are calculable .",
    "our model presents one possible mechanism for the generation of masses in holographic technicolor models , an issue that has not yet been addressed in this context .    using the ads / cft correspondence , we have calculated some basic quantities of phenomenological interest in our model , namely the @xmath0 parameter , the lightest technirho and technipion masses , and the dominant neutral technirho branching fractions .",
    "this provides a basis for future phenomenological studies .",
    "in particular , ( i ) a global electroweak analysis may provide useful constraints on the higgs boson and technirho masses , ( ii ) scalar - mediated flavor - changing - neutral - currents , which were studied in similar effective theories  @xcite , may also be re - examined in the present context , and ( iii ) the production of technipions , technivector and axial - vector resonances may be determined using holographic estimates of the relevant couplings . with the start of the lhc on the near horizon , a detailed collider simulation that incorporates these results would be well motivated .",
