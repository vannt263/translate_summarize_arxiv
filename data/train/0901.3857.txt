    "the kadomtsev  petviashvili equation in its version called kpii @xmath1 is a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional generalization of the celebrated korteweg  de  vries ( kdv ) equation . as a consequence ,",
    "the kpii equation admits solutions that behave at space infinity like the solutions of the kdv equation .",
    "for instance , if @xmath2 obeys kdv , then @xmath3 solves kpii for an arbitrary constant @xmath4 .",
    "thus , it is important to consider solutions of  ( [ kpii ] ) that decay at space infinity in all directions with exception of a finite number of 1-dimensional rays with behavior of the type of @xmath5 .",
    "even though kpii has been known to be integrable for more than three decades  @xcite , its general theory ( involving such non - decaying solutions ) is far from being complete .",
    "thus , the cauchy problem for kpii with rapidly decaying initial data was solved in  @xcite by using the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) method , based on the spectral analysis of the heat operator @xmath6 that gives the associated linear problem for the kpii equation . the standard approach to the spectral theory of the operator  ( [ heatop ] )",
    "is based on integral equations for the jost solution @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the spectral parameter , or for @xmath9 , jost solution of the dual operator @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is known that in the case of potentials with one - dimensional asymptotic behavior these integral equations are ill - defined .    in order to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "a resolvent approach was developed in  @xcite . in this approach",
    "a space of operators @xmath11 with kernels @xmath12 belonging to the space of tempered distributions of variables @xmath13 was introduced .",
    "ordinary differential operators @xmath14 are imbedded in this space as operators with kernels @xmath15 due to the additional dependence on the parameter @xmath16 these operators are called extended operators . in this space a generalization of the resolvent of a differential operator , called extended resolvent , was introduced , enabling consideration of the spectral theory of operators with nontrivial asymptotic behavior at space infinity .    in  @xcite we considered the nonstationary schrdinger and heat operators with potentials with only one direction of nondecaying behavior .",
    "the first step in solving the problem was the embedding of a pure one - dimensional spectral theory in the two - dimensional one , building the two - dimensional extended resolvent for an operator with potential @xmath17 .",
    "the second step was the dressing of this resolvent by an arbitrary bidimensional perturbation of the potential @xmath5 .",
    "finally , all mathematical entities appearing in the ist theory were obtained from this dressed resolvent by a reduction procedure , allowing the formulation of the direct and inverse problems .",
    "let us also mention that the standard spectral theory for the heat operator in the case of potentials nondecaying in one space direction was developed in  @xcite , but under some special and inexplicit conditions on the potential .",
    "here we consider the substantially more complicated problem : the case of a potential @xmath18 non decaying along multiple non parallel rays .",
    "thus now there is no analogy with the one - dimensional case and the whole theory has to be constructed directly , without embedding one - dimensional entities in two dimensions .",
    "therefore , we are obliged to consider directly true bidimensional potentials as it was already done in  @xcite for the nonstationary schrdinger operator . in fact",
    ", we apply the same procedure that was successfully applied in that case .",
    "precisely , in order to get the potential corresponding to @xmath0 solitons `` superimposed '' to a generic smooth decaying potential and the related jost solutions we construct these entities directly by means of twisting transformations instead of using recursively the ( binary ) darboux transformation . in this way we recover potentials and jost solutions that were obtained in  @xcite by using a recursive procedure and , also",
    ", some alternative representations of the pure solitonic potentials obtained in @xcite by using the @xmath19 functions .",
    "it is worth noting that the heat operator is not self - dual and thus singular behaviors of the left and right twisting operators are not obliged to be correlated .",
    "this explains why the structure of the @xmath0 soliton solution of kpii is much richer than for kpi . in particular",
    ", the @xmath0 soliton solution can have a different number of `` ingoing '' and `` outgoing '' ( in the sense of @xmath20 , or @xmath21 ) rays .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .  [ back ]",
    "we briefly review some aspects and basic ideas of the extended resolvent approach , referring to the example of an operator  ( [ heatop ] ) with a smooth , rapidly decaying potential @xmath22 . for further details ,",
    "we refer the interested readers to  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ twist ] we introduce the twisting operators , i.e. , operators that `` twist '' the operator @xmath23 , extension in the sense of  ( [ 2 ] ) of the operator @xmath24 in  ( [ heatop ] ) , to an operator @xmath25 of the same kind with a potential @xmath26 describing @xmath0 solitons `` superimposed ''  la darboux to the background potential @xmath18 . in sec",
    ".  [ resolvent ] , by using these twisting operators , under the assumption of the existence of the resolvent @xmath27 we derive an explicit expression for its kernel @xmath28 .",
    "so the problem of the existence of the resolvent @xmath27 is reduced to the problem of finding the region in the @xmath16-plane , where this kernel is a tempered distribution .",
    "this problem resulted to be more arduous than in the case of the nonstationary schrdinger operator and , therefore , in sec .",
    "[ soliton ] , we first consider the pure @xmath0-soliton potentials and , afterwards , in sec .

    "let us introduce the space of * extended * operators @xmath11 , i.e. , operators with kernel @xmath12 belonging to the space @xmath38 of tempered distributions of the six real variables @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . for two extended operators @xmath11 and @xmath42 with kernels @xmath12 and @xmath43 we introduce the composition law @xmath44 provided the integral exists in terms of distributions .",
    "an operator @xmath45 can have an inverse , @xmath46 , in the sense of this composition : @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the unity operator , i.e. , the operator with kernel @xmath50 . a specific subclass of extended operators is given by the extensions @xmath51 of differential operators as defined in  ( [ 2 ] ) , where @xmath14 denotes a differential operator whose coefficients are smooth functions of @xmath35 .",

    "notice , however , that , since the kernels of the operators @xmath45 are only subjected to the requirement of belonging to the space of tempered distributions , in general , the hat - kernel @xmath55 still depends on @xmath16 and is not necessarily bounded . the conjugate @xmath56 of an operator @xmath11 is defined by @xmath57    it is convenient to introduce the representation of the operator @xmath11 in the @xmath58-space which is defined by the fourier transform @xmath59 where @xmath60 and we introduced a two dimensional * complex * vector @xmath61 the composition ( [ 3 ] ) in the @xmath58-space becomes a sort of shifted convolution @xmath62    then , with these notations , the extension of the heat operator  ( [ heatop ] ) reads @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the extension in the sense of  ( [ 2 ] ) of the differential part @xmath65 of the heat operator  ( [ heatop ] ) and has , in the @xmath58-space , thanks to  ( [ px ] ) , kernel given by @xmath66 the main object of our approach is the extended resolvent ( or resolvent , for short ) @xmath67 of the operator @xmath51 , which is the inverse of the operator @xmath23 in the sense of composition  ( [ 3 ] ) ( or  ( [ comp ] ) ) , i.e. , @xmath68 and can be defined as the solution of the integral equations @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the resolvent of the zero potential ( bare ) operator @xmath64 .",
    "thanks to  ( [ l0 ] ) we have @xmath71 for the kernel of this operator in the @xmath58-space . in the case of a rapidly decaying potential @xmath22 , the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the equations in  ( [ inteqm ] ) can be proved in analogy with  @xcite .",

    "let us consider a transformation from the operator @xmath23 in  ( [ l ] ) to a new operator of the same form @xmath98 given by means of an operator pair @xmath96 , @xmath97 according to the formulas @xmath99 `` twisting '' @xmath23 to @xmath25 .",
    "we consider the potential @xmath22 in @xmath23 to be a real , smooth and rapidly decaying function of @xmath35 and we look for self - conjugate @xmath96 and @xmath97 such that the new potential @xmath100 is also real and smooth .",

    "this kernel is different from zero only in the interval where @xmath190 is between the lowest and highest values of the @xmath191 s . indeed , while for @xmath190 below this interval this is obvious by  ( [ ap4 ] ) , for the values of @xmath190 above the interval this follows from the equality @xmath192 that in its turn is a consequence of  ( [ phipsi : final ] ) .",
    "now , according to the discussion above , we expect that @xmath193 has a structure similar to @xmath194 .",

    "then , since thanks to  ( [ dualjost ] ) , ( [ sol19:1 ] ) and  ( [ tau1 ] ) @xmath237 is proportional to the value of the dual jost solution @xmath33 at @xmath238 , we have @xmath239 and , consequently , @xmath240 for any operator @xmath241 with kernel @xmath242 where @xmath243 is any arbitrary self - conjugate function , bounded in @xmath35 and identically zero outside the polygon introduced above .",
