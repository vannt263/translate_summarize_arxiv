    "in this paper we consider the problem of finding an invariant riemannian metric for a mapping preserving a given volume form on a riemannian manifold .",
    "the setup of the problem is the following .",
    "let @xmath6 be a smooth , closed and oriented finite dimensional manifold .",
    "then the set of all riemannian metrics @xmath7 can be considered as an infinite dimensional manifold .",
    "its tangent vectors can be given an @xmath8 inner product  @xcite and thus computing the curvature of @xmath7 makes sense .",
    "the sectional curvature of @xmath7 is nonpositive , but @xmath7 is not geodesically complete  @xcite .    instead of @xmath7",
    "we consider a submanifold @xmath9 of @xmath7 consisting of riemannian metrics which all have the same given volume form @xmath5 .",
    "the submanifold @xmath9 is an infinite dimensional globally symmetric space .",
    "the exponential mapping is a diffeomorphism , it has nonpositive curvature and any two points can be joined by a unique geodesic . for details of these statements , see  @xcite .",
    "diffeomorphisms preserving a given volume form are called volumorphisms .",
    "they act naturally by pullback on @xmath9 and the action is isometric",
    ". let @xmath10 be some riemannian metric on @xmath6 whose induced volume form is @xmath5 and @xmath11 a volumorphism of @xmath6 .",
    "tangent spheres defined by @xmath10 are mapped to tangent ellipsoids by the pushforward of @xmath11 .",
    "the sphere and its image under the pushforward of @xmath11 , the ellipsoid , have the same volume due to the fact that @xmath11 is a volumorphism , but we have no control on how much the sphere is distorted .",
    "we ask the following question . if the tangent spheres are boundedly distorted under the iterations of the pushforward of @xmath11 , is there another riemannian metric , say @xmath1 , such that tangent spheres defined by @xmath1 are mapped to spheres ?",
    "since in this case the mapping @xmath11 considered as a mapping @xmath12 would be an isometry , the riemannian metric @xmath1 is in this sense an optimal riemannian metric for @xmath11 .",
    "a similar idea has been used in the study of quasiconformal mappings in  @xcite .",
    "we formalise the idea explained above and ask : `` if the action of a volumorphism on @xmath9 has a bounded orbit , is there a fixed point of this action ? '' .",
    "we consider the space of riemannian metrics of sobolev class @xmath3 and assume that the mapping @xmath11 is of sobolev class @xmath13 , @xmath4 .",
    "we show that the answer to the question above is affirmative if we allow the possibility that the fixed point is of lower regularity than @xmath3 .    a fixed point of the action of @xmath11 on @xmath2 ,",

    "we expect @xmath14 to be the metric completion of @xmath17 .    to find a fixed point for the action of a volumorphism on @xmath9 , we generalize a mean ergodic theorem and a fixed point theorem to suit our nonlinear setting .",

    "there is no obvious notion of average , but on nonpositively curved spaces , such as @xmath2 , there is a natural generalization of averages  @xcite .",
    "averages are also called means or centers of mass in the literature .",
    "the class of metric spaces where we formulate our mean ergodic theorem and fixed point theorem is that of complete global alexandrov nonpositive curvature spaces , which are also known as ( complete ) @xmath19 spaces .",
    "alexandrov nonpositive curvature spaces have been studied in a setting similar to ours in  @xcite . in both of the above - mentioned theorems ,",
    "we assume that the mapping considered is nonexpansive .",
