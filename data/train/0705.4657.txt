    "a basic result in the quantum field theory of fundamental particles in @xmath6 space - time dimensions is that requiring lorentz invariance for spin-@xmath7 particles necessarily leads to the free dirac lagrangian . here",
    "`` spin-@xmath7 '' refers to the 3-dimensional rotational subgroup of the lorentz group .",
    "the lie algebra of the lorentz group is @xmath8 , where one linear combination of the two @xmath9 symmetries is identified as angular momentum ; thus spin representations are promoted to lorentz representations in a straightforward manner .",
    "this paper in part deals with the following basic question .",
    "suppose one wishes to describe the quantum field theory of spin-@xmath7 particles in a physical context where the dispersion relation happens to be lorentz invariant , but unlike in fundamental particle physics the full lorentz invariance is not evidently required .",
    "in particular , we have in mind systems in condensed matter physics where the relativistic dispersion relation arises as a consequence of special properties of the system , and what plays the role of the speed of light is some material - dependent velocity . for instance , the effective mass of electronic quasi - particles may go zero because one is near a quantum critical point or more simply because of band structure as in 2-dimensional graphene @xcite , and massless particles , like photons , usually require a relativistic dispersion relation . under these circumstances , the question is whether such a quantum field theory must necessarily be that of a dirac fermion . in the case of graphene ,",
    "the fermionic quasi - particles do turn out to be described by the massless dirac equation .",
    "the reason for this is not an intrinsic lorentz invariance , but rather that the continuum limit of a tight binding model on a hexagonal lattice gives a hamiltonian that is first order in derivatives , and near the fermi points the particles are massless .    in this paper",
    "we will study an alternative to the dirac theory .",
    "the model is built out of an @xmath0-component complex fermionic field with a non - dirac , two - derivative action with a lorentz - invariant dispersion relation .",
    "this model has a symplectic @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "if this symmetry is viewed as an internal symmetry , then the fields are lorentz scalars and the theory is lorentz invariant but with the `` wrong '' statistics . however , since the lie group @xmath1 has an @xmath2 subgroup , we can identify the latter with rotational spin .",
    "therefore our model can naturally describe spin-@xmath7 particles .",
    "the fermionic statistics is then in accordance with the spin - statistics connection , which requires spin-@xmath7 particles to be described by fermionic fields .",
    "however since the rotational spin-@xmath7 is not promoted to a representation of the lorentz group as in the dirac theory , our model is strictly speaking not lorentz invariant ; hence the terminology `` semi - lorentz '' invariant .",
    "the most serious potential problem of this theory concerns its unitarity , and this is addressed in the present paper .",
    "we show that the hamiltonian is pseudo - hermitian , [ intro.1 ] h^= c h c , where @xmath10 is a unitary operator satisfying @xmath11 .",
    "this generalization of hermiticity was considered long ago by pauli @xcite , and more recently by mostafazadeh @xcite as a way of explaining the real spectrum and addressing the unitarity issue in @xmath12 symmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the important point is that by suitably defining a @xmath10-dependent inner product , pseudo - hermiticity of @xmath13 is sufficient to ensure a unitary ( i.e. , norm - preserving ) time evolution .",
    "this is explained in section  ii .",
    "one should also point out that taking a non - relativistic limit in the kinetic term one obtains a perfectly unitary second - quantized description of interacting fermions .",
    "the identification of the @xmath2 lie sub - algebra of @xmath1 with rotational spin is described in section  iii .",
    "there we also study the discrete space - time symmetries of time - reversal and parity , and show how the spin generators transform properly under them .",
    "another possible signature of non - unitarity comes from studying finite - size or finite - temperature effects .",
    "we show in section  iv that whereas imposing periodic boundary conditions leads to a negative coefficient in the free energy , correctly imposing anti - periodic boundary conditions , as is normally appropriate for fermions , leads to a positive coefficient .",
    "( in two dimensions this coefficient is related to the virasoro central charge . )",
    "symplectic fermions are interesting for potential applications to critical phenomena .",
    "first of all , in @xmath14 , since the group of spacial rotations is simply @xmath15 , there are less constraints coming from lorentz invariance .",
    "more importantly , unlike dirac fermions , four - fermion interactions in @xmath14 drive the theory to some novel low - energy fixed points that are fermionic versions of the wilson - fisher @xcite fixed points .",
    "the reason is simple : in three dimensions a symplectic fermion @xmath16 has classical ( or mean field ) scaling dimension @xmath17 , whereas dirac fermions @xmath18 have dimension 1 ; therefore @xmath19 is a dimension-2 operator and is relevant in @xmath14 , whereas @xmath20 is irrelevant .",
    "this was the original motivation for the work @xcite , where it was attempted to interpret these fixed points at @xmath21 as examples of deconfined quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "although it remains unclear whether our fermionic critical point can correctly describe deconfined quantum criticality as defined in @xcite , the resolution of the unitarity problem as presented in this paper is sufficient motivation to analyze the critical exponents further . in sections v and",
    "vi we extend the analysis of @xcite to two - loop order .",
    "in particular , we show that some of the critical exponents can be obtained by analytically continuing known results for the @xmath22 wilson - fisher fixed point to @xmath23 .. ] we also calculate the critical exponents for composite bilinear operators , which to our knowledge have not been studied for the @xmath22 fixed points . in @xcite . ]",
    "the correspondence of our model with @xmath22 for negative @xmath24 is merely formal and not expected to be valid for all physical properties .",
    "first of all , the symmetries of the models are different",
    ". it should also be clear from the fact that in applications to condensed matter physics , our model has a fermi surface , etc .",
    "some concrete distinctions in the finite - size effects are made in section  iv .    in section",
    "vii we speculate on some possible applications to @xmath25 dimensional quantum criticality in condensed matter physics . in the broadest terms , at the fixed point our model can be viewed as a quantum critical theory of spinons , where the symplectic fermions are fundamental spinon fields . for @xmath21 components ,",
    "we discuss possible applications to quantum anti - ferromagnetism , where the magnetic order parameter @xmath26 is a composite operator in terms of spinons @xmath27 .",
    "this compositeness is the same as in deconfined quantum criticality @xcite , however our model is different since it has no @xmath15 gauge field .",
    "we show that two - point correlation exponents ( @xmath28 ) are rather large compared to the bosonic wilson - fisher fixed point , and this is mainly due to the compositeness of @xmath26 . by treating both cases ,",
    "we show this is true irrespective of whether the particles are bosons or fermions .",
    "section  viii contains a summary of our main findings and some conclusions .",
    "let @xmath16 denote an @xmath0-component complex field and consider the following action in @xmath29 dimensional minkowski space : [ sp1 ] s _",
    "= d^ddt , where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath16 is taken to be a lorentz scalar , then the model is lorentz invariant .",
    "the above action has an explicit internal @xmath32 symmetry . in the next section",
    "we show that , if @xmath16 is a fermion , then there is actually a hidden @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "we wish to quantize this model with @xmath16 taken to be a fermionic ( grassman ) field .",
    "the conjugate - momentum fields are @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "they obey the canonical anti - commutation relations [ tw1 ] \\ { ^(,t ) , _",
    "t^(,t ) } = - \\ { ^(,t ) , _ t^(,t ) } = i^",
    "^(d)(- ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is [ tw2 ] h = d^d .",
    "note that because of the fermion statistics the interaction term vanishes for @xmath35 .",
    "consider first the free theory with @xmath36 .",
    "suppressing the component indices , the fields have the following mode expansions consistent with the equations of motion : [ tw3 ] ( x ) & = & @xmath37 , + ( x ) & = & @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the extra minus sign in the @xmath41 term in @xmath42 is chosen so that the anti - commutation relations ( [ tw1 ] ) lead to the standard non - vanishing canonical relations [ tw4 ] \\ { b_+ , b^_+ } = \\ { b_- , b^_- } = ^(d ) ( -  ) , where it is understood that the field operators belong to the same field component .",
    "of course , the extra sign would be unnecessary if @xmath16 was a bosonic field .    with the above definitions the fields have the required properties under causality",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) , namely @xmath43 and [ tw4bb ] \\",
    "{ ^(x ) , ^(y ) } = ^ , where [ tw4bbb ] _ + ( x ) = e^i .",
    "since @xmath44 depends only on @xmath45 and is well - defined for space - like separation ( @xmath46 ) , it follows that @xmath47 and @xmath48 anti - commute for space - like separated points @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that the hamiltonian densities @xmath51 and @xmath52 also commute at space - like separation .",
    "we will return to the spin - statistics connection below .    in terms of the momentum - space modes ,",
    "the free hamiltonian is [ tw4b ] h = d^d   _ @xmath53 = d^d   _ @xmath54 + we can discard the infinite constant in the above equation , which is equivalent to normal - ordering the hamiltonian . let us define the vacuum @xmath55 as the state being annihilated by @xmath56 . as a result ,",
    "all states have positive energy .",
    "the one - particle states are doubly degenerate : [ spec ] hb^_,|0 = h|,= _ | , .",
    "for @xmath35 the theory is manifestly invariant under a @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "the corresponding conserved current satisfying @xmath57 is @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the conserved charge @xmath59 can be expressed as [ tw6 ] q = d^d   _ @xmath60 . with these conventions ,",
    "the operators @xmath61 and @xmath41 have charge @xmath62 , whereas @xmath63 and @xmath64 have charge @xmath65 .",
    "the usual spin - statistics connection ( see for instance @xcite ) is based on causality as described above , along with the requirement that the hamiltonian must be constructed out of @xmath16 and its hermitian adjoint in order for it to be hermitian .",
    "the latter is violated here : because of the extra minus sign in the mode expansion of @xmath42 for the fermionic case , one sees that unlike for the bosonic case , @xmath42 is not the hermitian adjoint of @xmath16 . let us introduce a unitary operator @xmath10 satisfying @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which is defined by the properties @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "then the relation between @xmath42 and @xmath16 can be expressed as [ tw8 ] = c ^c . since @xmath70 , the hamiltonian satisfies the  intertwined \" hermiticity condition [ tw9 ] h^= c h c .",
    "the above is also true in the interacting theory since @xmath71^\\dagger = c(\\chibar \\chi)^2 c$ ] .",
    "( note that for the free theory in momentum space , @xmath10 actually commutes with @xmath13 as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ tw4b ] ) , and hence the above equation is trivially satisfied ; however , this is no longer the case in the interacting theory . )",
    "hamiltonians satisfying eq .",
    "( [ tw9 ] ) were considered long ago by pauli @xcite and more recently by mostafazadeh @xcite in connection with @xmath12 symmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "we will follow the previously introduced terminology and refer to such hamiltonians as @xmath10-pseudo - hermitian .",
    "quantum mechanics based on pseudo - hermitian operators has some very desirable properties , which parallel the standard ones .",
    "first of all , as we now explain , a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian can still define a unitary quantum mechanics if one defines the inner product appropriately .",
    "specifically , consider a new inner product defined as [ tw10 ] |_c |c| .",
    "then probability is conserved with respect to this modified inner product , i.e. , the norms of states are preserved under time evolution : [ tw11 ] (t)|(t)_c = | e^ih^t c e^-iht | = | c",
    "e^iht c^2 e^-iht | = |_c .",
    "pseudo - hermiticity also ensures that the eigenvalues of @xmath13 are real . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath72 denote an eigenstate of @xmath13 with eigenvalue @xmath73 .",
    "then [ reale ] ( e - e^*)_e|_e_c = _ e| ( ch - h^c ) |_e = 0 .",
    "therefore eigenstates of @xmath13 with non - zero c - norm necessarily have real energies .",
    "other properties are proven in @xcite .    in the sequel it will be convenient to define the pseudo - hermitian adjoint @xmath74 of any operator @xmath75 as the proper hermitian adjoint with respect to the c - inner product : [ twistedher ] |a|_c^ * |a^|_c , which implies [ dagc ] a^=",
    "the pseudo - hermiticity condition on the hamiltonian then simply reads @xmath76 .",
    "one can easily establish that this pseudo - hermitian adjoint satisfies the usual rules , e.g.[rules1 ] ( ab)^&= & b^a^ , + ( a a + b b)^&= & a^ * a^+ b^ * b^ , where @xmath77 are operators and @xmath78 are complex numbers .",
    "the action ( [ sp1 ] ) has an explicit @xmath32 symmetry irrespective of whether @xmath16 is bosonic or fermionic . if @xmath16 is bosonic , then the action expressed in terms of real fields has an @xmath79 symmetry . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> we study a model of @xmath0-component complex fermions with a kinetic term that is second order in derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> this symplectic fermion model has an @xmath1 symmetry , which for any @xmath0 contains an @xmath2 subgroup that can be identified with rotational spin of spin-@xmath3 particles . </S>",
    "<S> since the spin-@xmath3 representation is not promoted to a representation of the lorentz group , the model is not fully lorentz invariant , although it has a relativistic dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is pseudo - hermitian , @xmath4 , which implies it has a unitary time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> renormalization - group analysis shows the model has a low - energy fixed point that is a fermionic version of the wilson - fisher fixed points . </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponents are computed to two - loop order . </S>",
    "<S> possible applications to condensed matter physics in @xmath5 space - time dimensions are discussed . </S>"
