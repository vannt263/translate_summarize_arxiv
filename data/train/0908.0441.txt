    "up to now , the only detected extra - terrestrial sources of neutrinos are the sun and supernova sn1987a . to extend the search to tev energies and above , neutrino telescopes such as amanda and icecube",
    "@xcite have been built .",
    "it turns out that the noise rates of the light sensors ( oms ) in the antarctic ice are very low ( @xmath1 for amanda , @xmath2 for icecube ) opening up the possibility to detect mev electron anti - neutrinos from close supernovae by an increase in the collective rate of all light sensors .",
    "the possibility to monitor the galaxy for supernova with neutrino telescopes such as amanda has first been proposed in  @xcite and a first search has been performed using data from the years 1997 and 1998 @xcite .",
    "the version of the the supernova data acquisition ( sndaq ) covered in this paper has been introduced for amanda in the beginning of the year 2000 and was extended to icecube in 2007 .",
    "the amanda sndaq has been switched off in february 2009 .",
    "we will investigate data recorded by both telescopes concentrating on the 9 years of amanda measurements and make predictions for the expected sensitivity of icecube .",
    "in amanda , the pulses of the 677 oms are collected in a vme / linux based data acquisition system which operates independently of the main data acquisition aimed at high energy neutrinos .",
    "it counts pulses from every connected optical module in a 20 bit counter in fixed @xmath3 time intervals that are synchronized by a gps - clock .    in icecube ,",
    "pmt rates are recorded in a @xmath4 binning by scalers on each optical module . the information is locally buffered and read out by the icecube data acquisition system .",
    "it then transfers this data to the sndaq , which synchronizes and regroups the information in @xmath5 bins .",
    "the software used for data acquisition and analysis is essentially the same for amanda and icecube .",
    "the data is rebinned in @xmath6 intervals and subjected to an online analysis described later . in case of a significant rate increase ( `` supernova trigger '' ) ,",
    "an alarm is sent to the supernova early warning system ( snews , @xcite ) via the iridium satellite network and the data is saved in a fine time binning ( @xmath3 for amanda and @xmath7 for icecube ) .",
    "in @xmath6 time binning , the pulse distribution of the average amanda or icecube om conforms only approximately to a gaussian .",
    "it can more accurately be described by a lognormal distribution ( see figure  [ fig::dom_lognormal_fit ] ) .",
    "[ fig::dom_lognormal_fit ]    the pulse distributions exhibit poissonian and correlated afterpulse components contributing with similar strengths . the correlated component is anticorrelated with temperature and arises form cherenkov light caused by @xmath8 decays and glass luminescence from radioactive decay chains .",
    "a cut at @xmath9 on the time difference of consecutive pulses effectively suppresses afterpulse trains , improves the significance of a simulated supernova at @xmath10 by approximately @xmath11 and makes the pulse distribution more poissonian in nature .",
    "supernovae radiate all neutrino flavors , but due to the relatively large inverse beta decay cross section , the main signal in icecube is induced by electron anti - neutrinos ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the rate @xmath12 per om can be approximated weighing the energy dependent anti - electron neutrino flux at the earth @xmath13 ( derived from the neutrino luminosity and spectra found in  @xcite ) with the effective area for anti - electron neutrino detection @xmath14 and integrating over the whole energy range :    @xmath15    @xmath16 is the inverse beta decay cross section , @xmath17 the density of protons in the ice and @xmath18 the effective volume for positron detection of a single om .",
    "@xmath18 can be calculated by multiplying the number of cherenkov photons produced with the effective volume for photon detection @xmath19 .    by tracking cherenkov photons in the antarctic ice around the icecube light sensors  @xcite and simulating the module response one obtains @xmath20 for the most common amanda sensors and @xmath21 for the icecube sensors . with a simulation",
    ", the amount of photons produced by a positron of an energy @xmath22 can is estimated to be @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , the effective volumes for positrons as a function of their energies are @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ". uncertainties in the effective volumes derive directly from the uncertainties of the ice models ( @xmath26 ) and in the om sensitivities ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "in this paper we assume a supernova neutrino production according to the _ lawrence - livermore _ model  @xcite as it is the only one that provides spectra for up to @xmath28 .",
    "it gives a mean electron anti - neutrino energy of @xmath29 corresponding to an average positron energy of @xmath30 .",
    "a simple investigation of the rate sums would be very susceptible to fluctuations due to variations in the detector response or external influences such as the seasonal variation of muon rates .",
    "medium and long term fluctuations are tracked by estimating the average count rate by a sliding time window .",
    "the rate deviation for a collective homogeneous neutrino induced ice illumination is calculated by a likelihood technique . in time bins of @xmath31 and longer ,",
    "the pulse distributions can be approximated by gaussian distributions . for a collective rate increase @xmath32 ,",
    "the expectation value of the average mean rate @xmath33 of a light sensor @xmath34 with relative sensitivity @xmath35 increases to @xmath36 .",
    "the mean value @xmath33 and its standard deviation @xmath37 are averaged over a sliding window of @xmath38 , excluding @xmath28 before and after the @xmath39 time frame @xmath40 studied . by taking the product of the corresponding gaussian distributions the following likelihood for a rate deviation @xmath32 is obtained :    @xmath41    minimization of @xmath42 leads to : @xmath43    the data is analyzed in the three time binnings @xmath31 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the following reasons : first , the finest time binning accessible to the online analysis is @xmath31 .",
    "second , as argued in  @xcite , the neutrino measurements of sn1987a are roughly compatible with an exponential decay of @xmath46 . the optimal time frame for the detection of a signal with such a signature is @xmath47 .",
    "last , @xmath45 are the approximate time frame where most of the neutrinos from sn1987a fell .    to ensure data quality , the optical modules are subjected to careful quality checks and cleaning . those modules with rates outside of a predefined range , a high dispersion w.r.t",
    "the poissonian expectation or a large skewness are disqualified in real time .    since snews requests one alarm per 10 days , the supernova trigger is set to @xmath48 .    to ensure that the observed rate deviation is homogeneous and isotropic , the following @xmath49 discriminant",
    "is examined : @xmath50    we demand the data to conform to a @xmath49-confidence level of @xmath51 .",
    "however , it was found that the @xmath49 can not clearly distinguish between isotropic rate changes and fluctuations of a significant number of oms : if e.g. @xmath11 of the oms record rate increases of about @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , the significance for isotropic illumination can rise above @xmath54 without being rejected by the @xmath49 condition .",
    "still , no method was found that performed better than @xmath49 .",
    "figure  [ fig::sign_distri ] shows the distribution of the significance @xmath55 for amanda . from the central limit theorem",
    ", one would expect a gaussian distribution with a width of @xmath56 .",
    "this expectation is supported by a background simulation using lognormal representations of individual light sensor pulse distributions .",
    "however , one finds that the observable is spread wider than expected and exhibits a minor shoulder at high significances .",
    "time frames , scaledwidth=47.0% ]    [ fig::sign_distri ]    as this observable is central to the identification of supernovae , its detailed understanding is imperative and a close investigation of these effects is necessary .",
    "faults in the software were ruled out by simulating data at the most basic level , before entering the sndaq .",
    "hardware faults are improbable , as the broadening of the rates is seen both for amanda ( @xmath57 ) and icecube ( @xmath58 ) and the detectors use different and independent power and readout electronics .    one can then check for external sources of rate changes as tracked by magnetometers , rio- and photometers as well as seismometers at pole .",
    "all have been synchronized with the rate measurements of the oms .",
    "only magnetic field variations show a slight , albeit insignificant , influence on the rate deviation of @xmath59 for amanda . due to a @xmath60 metal wire mesh shielding , the influence on icecube sensors",
    "is smaller by a factor @xmath61 .",
    "it turns out that the main reason for the broadening are fluctuations of the atmospheric muon rates . during @xmath31",
    ", amanda detects between @xmath62 ( june ) and @xmath63 ( december ) sensor hits due to muons .",
    "adding hits from atmospheric muons broadens and distorts the distribution derived from noise rates .",
    "a simulation taking into account the muon triggered pmt hits increases the width of the significance distribution to @xmath64 ( see figure  [ fig::sign_distri ] ) .",
    "although the investigations are still ongoing for icecube , we expect the larger @xmath65 can be ascribed to its lower noise rate leading to a higher resolution and thereby a stronger sensitivity to perturbations .",
    "a fourier transformation was performed on the data stream .",
    "no evidence for periodically recurring events was found , but occasional correlations between subsequent @xmath39 time frames both in the summed noise rate and the rate deviation could be identified .",
    "we determined the mean significance before and after a rate increase exceeding a predefined level .",
    "one observes a symmetric correlation in the data mainly between @xmath66 .",
    "the origin of the effect , which is present both in amanda and icecube data , is under investigation .",
    "a preliminary analysis of amanda data from 2000 to 2003 yielded a detection range of @xmath67 at the optimal binning of @xmath44 at an efficiency of @xmath68 , encompassing @xmath69 of the stars of our galaxy . as signals with exponentially decreasing luminosity ( at @xmath46 )",
    "have been used as underlying models , the two other binnings were less efficient with @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , respectively .",
    "the rates of the icecube sensors are stable and uniform across the detector . scaling the observed rates to the full 80 string detector",
    ", a summed rate of @xmath74 is expected .",
    "while a single dom would only see an average rate increase of @xmath75 or @xmath76 , the signal in the whole icecube detector would be @xmath77 or @xmath78 for a supernova at @xmath79 distance .",
    "using this simple counting method , icecube would see a supernova in the magellanic cloud with @xmath80 significance .     in icecube.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]",
    "[ fig::ll_sn_7.5kpc ]    figure  [ fig::ll_sn_7.5kpc ] shows the expected signal in icecube for a supernova at @xmath81 conforming to the _ lawrence - livermore _ model with @xmath82 registered neutrinos in @xmath28 and a statistical accuracy of @xmath83 in the first @xmath84 .",
    "assuming @xmath85 events in super - kamiokande ( scaled from  @xcite ) , one arrives at an accuracy of @xmath86 in the same time frame .",
    "while icecube can neither determine the directions nor the energies of the neutrinos , it will provide worlds best statistical accuracy to follow details of the neutrino light curve .",
    "its performance in this respect will be in the same order as proposed megaton proton decay and supernova search experiments .",
    "as the signal is seen on top of background noise , the measurement accuracy drops rapidly with distance .",
    "figure [ fig::icecube_range ] shows the significance at which icecube and amanda would be able to detect supernovae .",
    "time frames , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    [ fig::icecube_range ]",
    "as mentioned before , the signal seen by amanda and icecube is mostly dominated by electron anti - neutrinos with a small contribution by electron neutrino scattering , thereby leading to a sensitivity which is strongly dependent on the neutrino flavor and is thus sensitive to neutrino oscillations .",
    "as the neutrinos pass varying levels of density within the supernova , the flux of electron and electron anti - neutrinos @xmath87 released is different from the initial flux @xmath88 produced during the collapse :    @xmath89    the survival probability @xmath90 for the @xmath91 s varies with the mass hierarchy and the mixing angle @xmath0  @xcite :    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab::osci ]    at the onset of the supernova neutrino burst during the prompt shock , a @xmath92 long burst of electron neutrinos gets emitted when the neutron star forms .",
    "as the shape and rate of this burst is roughly independent of the properties of the progenitor stars , it is considered as a standard candle , allowing one to determine neutrino properties without knowing details of the core collapse .",
    "the first @xmath93 of a supernova signal were modeled after @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig::sn_oscillation_scenarios_7.5kpc ] shows the expectation for a supernova at a distance of @xmath10 in the @xmath7 binning of icecube . due to statistics and the rising background from the starting electron anti - neutrino signal ,",
    "the identification of the neutronization burst is unlikely at this distance .",
