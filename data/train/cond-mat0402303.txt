    "there have been growing interests in study of complex adaptive systems using agent - based modeling .",
    "complex adaptive systems are ubiquitous in social , economics , and biological sciences ; they consist of agents using adaptive strategies to compete for limited resources . as changes in the global environment",
    "are induced by the agents themselves , it is important to study dynamics of such systems . even though agent - based models are simple , the outcomes may not be at all obvious because the agents typically use adaptive rather than optimizing strategies .",
    "the minority game , proposed by challet and zhang@xcite , is a prototypical agent - based model that can be analyzed using the tools of statistical mechanics .",
    "the game captures some essential features of complex adaptive systems in which the agents with limited information and rationality compete for limited resources . the key question in the study of agent - based models is , how evolution changes the behaviors of the agents . in the context of a simple evolutionary minority game ( emg ) , johnson and coworkers found that the agents universally self - segregate into two opposing extreme groups.@xcite hod and nakar ,",
    "on the other hand , claimed that a clustering of cautious agents emerges in a `` tough environment '' where the penalty for losing is greater than the reward for winning.@xcite we have derived a general formalism to understand the dynamical mechanism for the transition from segregation to clustering.@xcite our theory is based on an adiabatic approximation , in which short - time fluctuations are integrated out to obtain a steady state population distribution .",
    "we found that the effective rate of evolution plays an important role in determining the resulting steady - state population distribution .",
    "frequent strategy switching leads to large market inefficiency that favors clustering of cautious agents .",
    "the theory is illustrated with a detail statistical mechanical analysis of the emg limited to three groups of agents : two opposing groups and one cautious group ; it agrees very well with the numerical simulations of the original emg , but deviates from the numerical results of the three - group emg . in this paper",
    "we perform a further analysis of the three - group emg .",
    "we show that with an intermittency correction , which is particular to the three - group emg , the numerical results can be explained .",
    "we first briefly describe the emg model .",
    "there are n agents . at each round",
    "they choose to enter room 0 or room 1 . at the end of each round",
    "the agents in the room with fewer agents ( in the minority ) win a point ; while the agents in the room with more agents lose a point .",
    "the winning room numbers ( 0 or 1 ) are recorded .",
    "the agents decisions are based on the same record ( a bit - string of length @xmath1 ) of the most recent winning room numbers .",
    "given the current @xmath1-bit string , the common basic strategy is simply to choose the winning room number after the most recent pattern of the same @xmath1-bit string in the historical record . to use the basic strategy is thus to follow the trend . in the emg",
    "each agent is assigned a probability @xmath2 : he will adopt the basic strategy with probability @xmath2 and adopt the opposite of the basic strategy with probability @xmath3 .",
    "the agents with @xmath4 or @xmath5 are `` extreme '' players , while the agents with @xmath6 are cautious players .",
    "the game and its outcomes evolve as the less successful agents , defined as the ones with the accumulated wealth less than @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , change their @xmath2 values . in the original emg model ,",
    "the new p value is chosen randomly in the interval of width @xmath9 centered around its original @xmath2 value .",
    "his wealth is reset to zero and the game continues .",
    "johnson and coworkers showed that the agents self - segregate into two opposing extreme groups with @xmath10 and @xmath11.@xcite thus , in order to succeed in a competitive society the agent must take extreme positions .",
    "this behavior can be explained by the market impact of the agents own actions which largely penalizes the cautious agents.@xcite however , hod and nakar later found that the above conclusion is only robust when the reward - to - fine ratio @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath13 there is tendency for the agents to cluster towards cautious behaviors and the distribution of the @xmath2 value , @xmath14 , may evolve to an inverted - u shape with the peak at the middle .",
    "we show that the transition from segregation to clustering in fact depends on all three parameters , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath7 .",
    "we derived a general expression@xcite for the critical value @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath18 is a constant of the order one .",
    "this was verified by our extensive simulations of the emg for a wide range of the parameter values.@xcite when @xmath19 the clustering only occurs for either very large @xmath15 or very small @xmath20 . at @xmath21",
    "the clustering disappears and the segregation to extreme behaviors becomes robust .",
    "we now briefly describe our theory , illustrated with the three - group emg model , in which @xmath2 takes only one of the three possible values @xmath22 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the agents in group 0 ( with @xmath4 ) make the opposite decision to the agents in group 1 ( with @xmath23 ) .",
    "we denote the group with @xmath6 group m ; this is the group of cautious agents .",
    "we begin by evaluating the average wealth reduction for the agents in each of the three groups , given the number of agents @xmath24 in group 0 , m , and 1 respectively . by comparing the average wealth reduction in the extreme groups and in the cautious group",
    ", we can determine the transition from clustering to segregation .",
    "let @xmath25 be the number of agents in group m making the same decision ( decision a ) as those in group 0 .",
    "when @xmath26 , the distribution of @xmath25 can be approximated by a gaussian distribution @xmath27 where @xmath28 . by averaging over @xmath25 , we obtain the average change of wealth for the agents in group 0 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 ; @xmath31 is the error function @xmath32 . similarly the average change of wealth for the agents in group 1 is given by , @xmath33 the average change of wealth of the agents in the extreme groups ( group 0 and 1 ) is given by @xmath34 , or @xmath35    the second term in @xmath36 is due to the fluctuations of @xmath37 ; it is always negative .",
    "the larger the fluctuation in @xmath37 , the less efficient the market becomes .",
    "this term can be interpreted as the cost due to market inefficiency .",
    "large market inefficiency on average penalizes the players taking  extreme \" positions .",
    "the average wealth reduction for the agents in group m can be evaluated similarly by averaging over @xmath25 , @xmath38 the first term in @xmath39 is the same as that in @xmath36 . the second term can be interpreted as the market impact.@xcite a large market impact ( self - interaction ) penalizes the cautious players ; their own decisions increase their chances of being in the majority and hence increase their chances of losing .",
    "the relative magnitudes of the second terms in @xmath36 and @xmath39 determine whether clustering or segregation dominates .    to further evaluate @xmath36 and @xmath39 , we need to average over the distribution of @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the change in @xmath37 in one time step . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the steady state probability distribution @xmath41 for @xmath37 should satisfy @xmath42 where @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "this equation can be solved to give the distribution @xmath41 . after averaging @xmath37 over @xmath41",
    ", we obtain @xmath44 @xmath39 , on the other hand , is given by @xmath45 here @xmath46 .",
    "at the critical point , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "it is easy to verify that this occurs when @xmath49 note that @xmath40 is the number of extreme agents switching their strategies per time step . on average @xmath50 ,",
    "thus the crossover value for @xmath15 is @xmath51 ^ 2 $ ] . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the derivation can be generalized to a general emg involving more than three groups of agents .",
    "while the expression @xmath51 ^ 2 $ ] describes very well the transition in the original emg with a continuous distribution of @xmath2 , it does not describe the @xmath16 dependence of @xmath0 correctly for the transition in the three - group emg .",
    "this is due to the following particular feature of the three - group emg .",
    "the strategy switching of the agents in the  extreme \" groups does not occur at every losing step and is rather intermittent .",
    "a loss at the current round , for example , will not make the agents in the extreme groups to switch strategy if they have won in the previous two rounds .",
    "this gives rise to a gap @xmath52 between the lowest value of the wealth in an extreme group and the strategy - switching threshold at @xmath7 , as schematically illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "when the wealth distribution of the losing extreme group has @xmath53 , @xmath37 does not change , because no switching occurs in or out of the extreme groups . only the cases with",
    "@xmath54 affect the distribution of @xmath37 .",
    "thus we need to use the effective number of extreme agents switching their strategies per time step , averaged only over the cases with @xmath54",
    ". this effective rate of switching is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the probability that @xmath54 .",
    "the effect of intermittency of the strategy switching can be taken into account by using this effective @xmath57 .    to obtain the intermittency correction to the expression of @xmath0",
    ", we need to first calculate the probability @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath58 be the probability distribution of @xmath52 .",
    "since there are always new agents with wealth @xmath59 coming from group m at each step , @xmath52 can not be greater than @xmath20 .",
    "thus @xmath60 .",
    "since there are roughly equal numbers of winning and losing steps , @xmath58 should satisfy @xmath61 for @xmath62 we can approximate the above equation using the following differential equation ( this is adequate as @xmath58 is rather smoothly varying as a function of @xmath52 ) .",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "given the condition @xmath60 , the solution of the equation is @xmath65     vs @xmath66 for @xmath67 , and @xmath68,width=321 ]    @xmath69 is determined using the normalization condition @xmath70 : @xmath71 now @xmath56 is given by @xmath72 the critical value @xmath0 is determined from the relation @xmath73 ; this gives rise to @xmath74    the numerical values of @xmath0 vs @xmath20 from our extensive simulations are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "one notable feature is that @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath75 , but is independent of @xmath16 for sufficiently large values of @xmath20 .",
    "this can be explained using the above expression of @xmath0 . for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath56",
    "can be approximated by @xmath78 .",
    "this gives rise to @xmath79 for @xmath80 . from the figure",
    ", we can see the crossover to the @xmath79 behavior occurs roughly at @xmath81 , in agreement with the theory .",
    "this unique feature of the three - group emg model is completely due to the existence of a gap in the wealth distribution of the extreme groups . for the original emg model",
    ", there is no such gap , and @xmath82 holds very well .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived an intermittency correction to the critical value @xmath0 for the three - group emg .",
    "our estimates of @xmath0 agree well with the numerical results .",
    "we have identified the key difference between the three - group emg and the original emg with a continuous distribution of the p values : the existence of a gap in the wealth distribution of the extreme groups in the three - group emg .",
    "this key difference leads to a qualitative correction to the expression for @xmath0 .",
    "the general framework of the adiabatic approximation , however , is equally valid for studying the transition in both the original emg and the three - group emg .",
