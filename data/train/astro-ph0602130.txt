    "the hmi camera will measure the full stokes vector at 5 wavelength positions along the fe i 6173    line ( graham et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the ccd has 4024@xmath04024 pixels ( 0.5/pixel ) .",
    "our goal is to record the full stokes vector for the whole solar disk with a cadence of 80 - 120 seconds . at each wavelength position",
    "two consecutive linear combinations of the solar stokes vector are measured with a time delay of 4 seconds :    @xmath1    three different modulation matrices are under consideration : mod a , mod b and mod c. the total time needed to scan the line in the four polarization states across five wavelength positions is @xmath2 seconds ( @xmath3 is the number of rows in the modulation matrix in eq .  2 - 4 ) : 80s for mod a - b and 120 s for c.    @xmath4     +     @xmath5    @xmath6    when the linear system is solved in order to obtain the solar stokes vector , observations done at different times are mixed together .",
    "this introduces errors in the observed stokes vector :    @xmath7    for example , at @xmath8 modulation schemes measures @xmath9 and at @xmath104 seconds it measures : @xmath11 .",
    "therefore we can obtain stokes @xmath12 by combining observations done 4 seconds apart .",
    "note that to build stokes @xmath13 four different observations ( obtained at different times ) are mixed .",
    "to study the errors introduced in the determination of the solar magnetic field vector as a consequence of the solar p - modes , we take them into account when computing @xmath14 .",
    "the different profiles ( that enter into eq .  5 ) are shifted in quantities that correspond to the velocity changes associated with the solar p - modes .",
    "they are then inverted using a stokes inversion algorithm ( skumanich & lites 1987 ) that retrieves : the magnetic field vector , line of sight velocities and a filling factor ( fractional area of the pixel covered by the magnetic atmosphere ) .",
    "results from the inversion are displayed in fig .  1 ( top panels ) .",
    "the noise level for a single observation using hmi will be about @xmath15 in units of the continuum intensity .",
    "this number considers a light level of the quiet sun at disk center . for off - limb observations and/or darker regions ( sunspots )",
    "the noise level will be different .",
    "a realistic simulation has been performed taking into account the solar p - modes effect and photon noise simultaneously . in this case",
    "we restrict ourselves to consider only modulation schemes a and c. results are presented in fig .  1 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "due to the oscillatory nature of the solar p - modes , its effect on the observed profiles can be reduced if we use time averaged profiles . by doing",
    "so we can improve the accuracy in the determination of the magnetic field vector . note that time averaging will also reduce the effect of the photon noise .",
    "we have carried out several simulations using different averaging times .",
    "2 displays the errors in the determination of the magnetic field vector as a function of the time used in the average .",
    "this was done both for mod a and c. we distinguish between different solar regions by taking averages of pixels with different filling factors .",
    "hmi will provide full disk observations of the magnetic field vector with a cadence of 80 - 120 s and a spatial resolution of 0.5 arc sec .",
    "we have considered the main sources of error in the data and estimate how this will affect the reliability of the inferred vector .",
    "accuracy can be improved by using time averaged observations . for a 10 minutes",
    "average , the magnetic field in sunspots and plages can be known with a precision better than 10 gauss and 1@xmath16 in inclination and azimuth ."
