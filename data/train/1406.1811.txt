    "before the financial crisis started in july 2007 with bear stearns default , interest rate desks would essentially use a unique interest rate curve for each currency to price and hedge all derivative products .",
    "the crisis showed that big investment banks could default and therefore lending and borrowing activities became severely restricted , no longer allowing for certain hedging strategies .",
    "ever since , basis spreads of tenor swaps where no longer negligible .",
    "after some debate , today there exists a broad consensus about how this issue must be handled for a single currency setting .",
    "regarding different tenors , i.e. 3 and 6 month fra ( forward rate agreement ) , as independent entities , leaves enough room for new variables to fit the arbitrage free equations that traded products must satisfy . in the single currency setting ( see @xcite ) , the discount curve for each currency is build out of overnight indexed swaps ( ois ) through a bootstrapping algorithm . forward",
    "libor estimation curves for each different tenor frequency are thereafter calculated out of par and tenor swap quotes by another bootstrapping algorithm given the previously calculated discount curve .",
    "some theoretical models have been proposed for the dynamics of these curves ( e.g. see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .    in the cross currency swap market a similar situation exists .",
    "the price of traded foreign exchange ( fx ) forwards and cross currency swaps ( ccs ) can not be exactly derived from arbitrage free models calibrated exclusively to the swap markets on each currency and the fx spot price , ( see @xcite for a heuristic analytic formula to predict basis tenor and cross currency swaps ) .",
    "this is so , because fx forward and ccs prices are , among other things , driven by trading flows and as long as the differences between the `` theoretical price '' and the market price remain low , the expected return will not be enough to compensate the bank capital expenses .",
    "unfortunately , for the multi - currency setting , it is not easy to introduce new variables in a similar way as it was done for the single currency setting ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper proposes a generalized framework to price and hedge cross currency swaps .",
    "this framework makes it possible to map the entity funding structure while still matching liquidly traded products i.e. it allows centralizing funding or simply fund each leg in its own currency . starting from the single currency setting in each currency , it is based on the decomposition of customized cross currency swaps as a combination of market quoted currency swaps plus a minor amount of additional cash flows which embed the pricing and hedging inaccuracies which are model - dependent .",
    "these minor additional cash - flows can then be ois - discounted ( or funded ) in their own currency or converted to another currency through foreign exchange forwards and thereafter ois - discounted or funded in that currency .",
    "this naturally allows choosing the currency perspective from which funding is managed .",
    "when cross currency basis spreads tend to zero , this multi - currency pricing converges to the valuation of cash flows in each currency according to the single currency setting .",
    "valuation of complex multi - currency exotic products such as callable swaps are beyond the scope of this framework .",
    "the paper assumes full collateralization of trades ( see @xcite ) and a funding structure between front office desks and the balance sheet of the bank or alco ( asset and liability committee ) at the overnight index - rate at least on one currency , provided that desks do not have a consistent liquidity imbalance between borrowing and lending ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for more information about discounting and collateralized derivative pricing ) .",
    "when dealing with uncollateralized pricing and even if these hypotheses are not fulfilled , the collateralized framework will always provide a reference `` risk - free '' pricing on top of which funding and credit value adjustments can be applied ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for an overview of these adjustments ) .    the paper starts with section [ sec : productdef ] which defines the products involved in the discussion .",
    "section [ sec : study ] presents a study of foreign exchange and cross currency markets to illustrate their driving forces and motivate the proposed methodology .",
    "section [ sec : perspective ] shows how the funding currency is chosen for each currency .",
    "the proposed decomposition method to price cross currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards is presented in sections [ sec : pricefwdstccs ] to [ sec : pricefxfwd ] .",
    "section [ sec : hedging ] compares the proposed method with a benchmark using a worked example . finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes .",
    "this section describes and defines the products and the notation which will be used across the paper .",
    "figure [ fig : frn ] presents the structure of payments of a floating rate note .",
    "the issuer of the note receives the notional ( represented by 1 ) on the start date and pays floating interest , @xmath0 ( e.g. libor or euribor index ) , for each period from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , according to the frequency of the note .",
    "the fixing of the libor - index on @xmath1 , @xmath3 , is multiplied by the year fraction , @xmath4 , of the period from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "on expiry date , @xmath5 , the holder of the note pays the floating interest of the last period and returns the notional .",
    "the floating indices fix their value usually two business days before the start of each period and are paid two business days after the end of the period depending on the conventions .",
    "the notation @xmath6 represents the remaining cashflows of a frn that occur beyond @xmath7 and ending on @xmath5 , @xmath8 is a fixed spread added to the floating leg and @xmath9 is the currency in which fixed and floating payments are denominated ( @xmath9 corresponds to usd in figure [ fig : frn ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ncs ] presents the structure of a non - resettable cross currency swap ( ncs ) .",
    "the main purpose of this structure is to transfer funding from one currency to another ( e.g. giving a loan in domestic currency and financing it by borrowing money in a foreign currency plus entering into a cross currency swap ) .",
    "this structure will be denoted @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the domestic currency ( eur in figure [ fig : ncs ] ) , @xmath12 is the foreign currency ( usd in figure [ fig : ncs ] ) , @xmath13 is the exchange rate fixing on date @xmath1 in units of foreign currency per unit of domestic currency , @xmath14 is the fixed spread added to the foreign floating leg and @xmath15 is the spread added to the domestic floating leg .        to reduce counterparty exposure due to foreign exchange risk , banks usually trade resettable currency swaps ( ccs ) of figure [ fig : ccs ] instead of the non - resettable structure of figure [ fig : ncs ] .",
    "the foreign notional is reset at the end of each period according to the foreign exchange rate at that moment.the upper dotted arrows of 1 eur correspond to the notional returned at the end of each period and the 1 eur lower dotted arrows correspond to the notional received at the beginning of each period starting on that date .",
    "both lines are dotted because they cancel each other .",
    "this structure will be denoted by @xmath16 .",

    "under the assumption of no arbitrage , a foreign exchange forward should be priced using a simple cash and carry reasoning according to equation ( [ eq : fxfwd ] ) , where @xmath20 denotes the forward foreign exchange rate from present time , @xmath21 , to expiry , @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23    considering that fixed income desks fund collateralized derivatives at the overnight - index rate , the discount factors of equation ( [ eq : fxfwd ] ) should be apparently calculated according to ois curves . however , foreign exchange markets are also shared by other participants such as money market desks , which will apply the same cash and carry reasoning but with a completely different set of market instruments such as deposit rates . in addition ,",
    "resettable currency swap ( ccs ) structures of different maturities may also imply foreign exchange forwards . before the crisis , the difference among these three methodologies was negligible .",
    "however , at this moment it is not .",
    "this means that a careful analysis is needed to know where real prices come from and why .",
    "figure [ fig : sprfxfwd ] compares the historical difference in basis points of the foreign exchange forward quoted in the market and those implied from deposit rates , ois curves and ccs for maturities of 3 , 6 and 9 months and 1 year .",
    "the first two methods ( deposit and ois ) use equation ( [ eq : fxfwd ] ) with different discount factors coming from either deposit rates ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the deposit rate with maturity @xmath22 ) and ois curves bootstrapped from ois swaps .",
    "the third method ( ccs ) estimates forward foreign exchange rates out of a bootstrapping method which calculates foreign exchange forwards implied from forcing zero valuation of market currency swaps .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : sprfxfwd ] , that for the four maturities , foreign exchange forwards estimated from ois curves show the highest difference with respect to actual traded forwards , followed by those estimated by deposit rates .",
    "foreign exchange forwards estimated from ccs are very aligned with market .",
    "these plots suggest that the foreign exchange market is shared by participants financed with deposit ( money market ) and overnight rates ( derivatives ) , having those financed with deposits a bigger weight .",
    "the reason why ccs and foreign exchange forwards are aligned is because both are zero cost contracts which are collateralized ( this does not happen with deposits ) .",
    "the misalignment of the foreign exchange forward rates does not come out of wrong discounting .",
    "theoretically , the foreign exchange forward could be arbitraged with the cash and hold argument ( foreign exchange forwards are normally collateralized ) .",
    "however , this would imply altering the bank cash balance forcing borrowing huge amounts of one currency and lending them into another .",
    "this situation is not sustainable as the alco would not provide funding at the overnight index rate for big amounts of cash consistently in the same direction .",
    "therefore , the challenge is to build pricing and hedging models in this situation of misaligned markets .",
    "most of the foreign exchange risk from multi - currency fixed income desks comes out of cross currency swaps .",

    "market data has been taken on january 29th 2014 , with spot and forward foreign exchange rates in usd per eur of \\{spot : 1.3533 , 1y : 1.3543 , 2y : 1.3610 , 3y : 1.3741 , 4y : 1.3928 , 5y : 1.4143 , 7y : 1.4589 , 10y : 1.5145 } , and a cross currency basis spread curve in basis points added to the eur floating leg of \\{1y : -4 , 2y : -5.5 , 3y : -6.25 , 4y : -7 , 5y : -7 , 7y : -6.75 , 10y : -5.75 , 15y : -4.75 , 20y : -4.5 } with zero spread on the usd floating leg .",
    "the four - curve method assumes centralized funding in eur and the proposed method , instead of considering centralized funding in either eur or usd , it will consider that each leg is funded in its own currency .",
    "each case considers five curves : eonia ( `` eo '' ) , 3 month euribor ( `` e3 m '' ) , federal funds ( `` ff '' ) , 3 month us libor ( `` u3 m '' ) and cross currency basis spread ( `` ccb '' ) .        f. ametrano and m. bianchetti , `` bootstrapping the illiquidity : multiple yield curves construction for market coherent forward rates estimation '' , modeling interest rates : last advances for derivatives pricing , ed .",

    "<S> it is well known that traded foreign exchange forwards and cross currency swaps ( ccs ) can not be priced applying cash and carry arguments . </S>",
    "<S> this paper proposes a generalized multi - currency pricing and hedging framework that allows the flexibility of choosing the perspective from which funding is managed for each currency . </S>",
    "<S> when cross currency basis spreads collapse to zero , this method converges to the well established single currency setting in which each leg is funded in its own currency . </S>",
