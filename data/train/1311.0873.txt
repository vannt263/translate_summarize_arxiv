    "the proximity of the virgo galaxy cluster , located at a distance of 16.5@xmath130.2 mpc @xcite , makes it one of the closest and most thoroughly studied laboratories of star and galaxy formation in the nearby universe .  with",
    "about 2000 known galaxy members @xcite , more than @xmath14 globular clusters ( gcs ) in m87 and m49 alone @xcite and a total gc population of @xmath15 for the entire ngvs region ( durrell et al .",
    "2013 , _ in prep .",
    "_ ) , it offers vast sample statistics to investigate the evolution of stellar populations and the formation and assembly histories of their host galaxies in a relatively dense cluster environment .",
    "the first detailed census of the virgo galaxy cluster was published by @xcite and consisted of a catalog of 2278 galaxies brighter than 18th magnitude .",
    "this survey led to the identification of several background clusters and to the discovery of a southern extension of the virgo cluster , which are impressive results given the technical limitations existing at that time .",
    "a quarter of a century later , @xcite published the first comprehensive catalog of dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster based on the study of photographic plates taken with the lick 20-inch astrograph .",
    "this work showed the presence of a large number of dwarf elliptical galaxies beyond the local group and started a new phase of the virgo cluster research .",
    "the most important contribution to assessing virgo cluster membership was published by @xcite in the form of the famous virgo cluster catalog ( vcc ) .",
    "this catalog consists of 2096 galaxies , covers an area of @xmath16 and is complete down to @xmath17 mag .",
    "the vcc has been the reference standard of virgo for more than a quarter of a century and it is about to be superseded by the next generation virgo cluster survey ( ngvs , * ? ? ?",
    "the ngvs is a multi - passband optical survey conducted with megacam at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on mauna kea , hawaii , a 3.6-meter telescope that benefits from superb seeing and transparency conditions .",
    "the ngvs survey area covers 104 contiguous square degrees out to the virial radius around m87 and m49 to unprecedented photometric depths in the five optical filters and @xmath18 , since of all filters only @xmath19 is significantly different from sdss u. ] @xmath20 and @xmath18 .  with substantially sub - arcsecond seeing , a surface brightness sensitivity better than @xmath21mag arcsec@xmath9 and a point - source detection limit of @xmath22mag ( @xmath23 )",
    ", this survey will extend our optical view of the galaxy luminosity function and the scaling relations of galaxies to luminosities more than five magnitudes below the faintest vcc galaxies for the numerical conversions between ab and vega magnitudes for ngvs and ngvs - ir filters . ] .",
    "the five optical passbands of ngvs combined with the superior spatial resolution of the images ( @xmath24-band seeing is better than @xmath25pc at virgo distance ) provide a first classification of the sources , but leave important areas of ambiguity .",
    "in particular , the identification and study of compact stellar systems and their stellar population properties is challenged by the age - metallicity - extinction degeneracy of optical colors @xcite .",
    "the difficulties begin already at the level of sample definition :  the distribution of old metal - poor gcs merges into the parameter space of dwarf stars in optical color - color diagrams , while metal - rich gcs overlap with the locus of remote late - type galaxies . around selected virgo galaxies ,",
    "the pointed observations of the hst / acs virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs ) have allowed a less ambiguous determination of the gc population due to the improved spatial resolution of hst @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic surveys are progressively extending the collection of well - classified objects to vaster areas , though with inevitable sparseness and depth limitations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      the ngvs near - infrared project ( ngvs - ir ) is designed to complement the ngvs with deep , spatially well - resolved images at wavelengths longer than the @xmath18 band to provide wider sampling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the first part of this project , and the subject of this paper , is a deep @xmath0-band survey conducted with the _ wide - field infrared camera _",
    "( wircam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at cfht that covers the central @xmath26 square degrees around the virgo cluster core , the location of the cd galaxy m87 and its vicinity .",
    "this area was the first fully surveyed in @xmath27 as part of the ngvs pilot survey , and we will refer to this field as the pilot field hereafter .",
    "the ngvs - ir observations are currently being expanded beyond the pilot field with the 4-meter class _ visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy _",
    "( vista ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the european southern observatory ( eso ) on cerro paranal in chile .",
    "these observations slightly overlap with the pilot field and cover regions around the brightest elliptical galaxy in virgo , m49 in the filters @xmath2 and @xmath0 , as well as a strip of @xmath2 and @xmath0-band images that connects the pilot field and the m49 field , and augments the coverage of the m86 group .  taken altogether",
    ", the current ngvs - ir survey area provides a total contiguous spatial coverage of the central regions in virgo of more than @xmath28 deg@xmath29 .",
    "the intermediate goals of the ngvs - ir survey are the development of a photometric selection method to identify globular clusters ( gcs ) in the virgo core region , the study of the age - metallicity - mass relations of gcs in m87 and the intracluster medium , the characterization of the stellar populations of ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) by combining optical / near - ir colors , the measurement of accurate distances to bright virgo galaxies by using the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method @xcite , the study of the star formation histories and mass profiles of several virgo galaxies , and lastly , the determination of the galaxy mass function of the virgo cluster .",
    "although the virgo cluster has already been observed at near - ir wavelengths , none of the available near - ir surveys is deep enough to accomplish the ngvs science goals .",
    "the two micro all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides uniform , precise photometry and astrometry over the entire celestial sphere in @xmath30 and @xmath0 bandpasses with @xmath31 limiting magnitudes of 15.8 , 15.1 and 14.3 mag , respectively .",
    "the 2mass survey offers the largest coverage of the virgo cluster in near - ir wavelengths , but its shallow photometry is not well suited for deep extragalactic studies .",
    "deeper photometry is provided by the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) large area survey ( las ) , which has a much smaller area than 2mass but reaches @xmath4 limiting magnitudes of 20.5 , 20.0 , 18.8 and 18.4 mag in @xmath32 and @xmath33 bandpasses , respectively .",
    "the deepest near - ir photometry of virgo galaxies corresponds to the spectroscopic and h - band imaging survey of virgo cluster galaxies ( shivir , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that consists of pointed @xmath34-band observations with the uh2.2 meter , ukirt , and cfht telescopes in good seeing conditions ( @xmath35 ) . while shivir provides deep @xmath34-band imaging for 286 vcc galaxies , it does not offer the one - to - one contiguous mapping with the optical ngvs data like ngvs - ir does .",
    "one of the most immediate aims of ngvs - ir is to improve source classification in order to obtain the cleanest possible samples of objects of any given type , and of gcs in particular .  for this purpose",
    ", it was decided to produce a first set of mosaic images and catalogs with a focus on compact sources with small angular sizes .  as will be shown below , adding near - ir photometry to the optical data",
    "provides an impressive separation of virgo gcs from foreground stars and background galaxies in near - uv / optical / near - ir color space . the @xmath10 diagram and @xmath19 to refer to the megacam filter .",
    "] , in particular , proves to be an exceptional tool for future searches of gcs and compact stellar systems , such as ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) around galaxies in a large variety of environments .  with more than 20deg@xmath29 of near - ir data soon available for virgo",
    ", we will improve the decontamination of the optically - selected samples currently analyzed within the ngvs collaboration and provide extensive studies of the gc distributions in luminosity , color , and space .",
    "those distributions contain a record of gc formation mechanisms and gc system assembly histories .",
    "they are also a key test for stellar population models , which still struggle to exploit optical and near - ir photometry jointly ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the construction of clean gc samples facilitates very efficient spectroscopic follow - up campaigns with little contamination by other sources .",
    "this , again , turns gcs into probes of galaxy cluster dynamics out to large scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )     mosaic cfht / wircam detector array .",
    "each chip features a hawaii2-rg near - infrared hgcdte detector with 18@xmath36 m pixels .",
    "the patrol field has @xmath37 active pixels with a 4-pixel wide border of reference pixels per chip .",
    "the field of view of the full detector array is about @xmath38 with 45  wide inter - chip gaps .",
    "_ image courtesy of academia sinica institute of astronomy and astrophysics ( asiaa)._,width=321 ]    a further motivation for ngvs - ir is the study of ucds and the dwarf galaxy ",
    "globular cluster transition . in the past decade , studies of the central regions of the virgo and fornax galaxy clusters have revealed dozens of massive compact objects in the magnitude range @xmath39mag with half - light radii between 10 and 30pc @xcite .",
    "currently , two popular formation scenarios are that ucds are the remnant nuclei of dwarf galaxies that were stripped by interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or alternatively that they are agglomerates of multiple clusters that merged early in their lifetimes during violent star - formation episodes such as those triggered by galaxy mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these scenarios can be tested through studies of the mass - metallicity relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ngvs will provide us with a larger sample of massive compact stellar systems within virgo than ever before , and with ngvs - ir we will be able to quantify the ages , metallicities and masses of these objects to higher accuracy than with optical colors alone ( see e.g * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the details of our observations in section  2 and the data reduction steps in section  3 .",
    "sections  4 and 5 contain a discussion of the point source photometry and completeness estimates , while section  6 includes the presentation of our first results .",
    "we summarize our work in section 7 .",
    "one may compare the values obtained here for cfht / megacam with those provided for a g2v star on the stellar isochrone web site of padova observatory ( http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd ) , where the same extinction law is assumed .",
    "their values of a(@xmath40)/a(v ) for megacam @xmath41 are 1.466 , 1.167 , 0.860 , 0.656 , 0.500 .",
    "no comparison value is available through that web interface for wircam / ks .",
    "note that the foreground extinction towards virgo is smaller a(v)=0.1 .",
    "uncertainties associated with neglecting color terms or using one or the other reference for extinction coefficients will therefore be smaller than @xmath420.5% ."
