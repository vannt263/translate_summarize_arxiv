    "there has been growing evidence that string theory contains smooth , horizonless bound - state or solitonic objects that have the same charges and supersymmetries as large bps black holes and that depend on arbitrary continuous functions of two variables .",
    "these objects , dubbed _ superstrata _ , were first conjectured to exist in @xcite , by realizing that some of the exotic brane bound states studied in @xcite can give rise to non - singular solutions in the duality frame where the charges of these objects correspond to momentum , d1-branes and d5-branes .",
    "it was subsequently argued that , assuming that superstrata existed , the most general class of such objects could carry an entropy that scales with the charges in exactly the same way as the entropy of the d1-d5-p black hole , and possibly even with the same coefficient @xcite . since",
    "this entropy would come entirely from smooth horizonless solutions , this would substantiate the fuzzball description of supersymmetric black holes in string theory : the classical solution describing these black holes stops giving a correct description of the physics at the scale of the horizon , where a new description in terms of fluctuating superstrata geometries takes over .",
    "partial evidence for the existence of superstrata can be obtained by analyzing string emission in the d1-d5 system @xcite , or by constructing certain smaller classes of supergravity solutions @xcite . however , to prove that superstrata indeed exist , one needs to explicitly construct smooth horizonless solutions that have the same charges as the d1-d5-p black hole and are parameterized by arbitrary continuous functions of two variables , which is a challenging problem .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct such solutions and thus demonstrate that superstrata exist .",
    "furthermore , we will be able to find precisely the cft states dual to these solutions and show that these states are not descendants of chiral primaries , which means that they are much more general than all the known solutions whose cft dual is precisely understood @xcite .",
    "this is a huge step toward achieving the ultimate goal of constructing all smooth horizonless solutions that have the right properties for reproducing the black - hole entropy and thus proving the fuzzball conjecture for bps black holes .",
    "our procedure relies on the proposal @xcite that superstrata can be obtained by adding momentum modes on two - charge d1-d5 supertubes : supertube solutions @xcite have eight supercharges and are parameterized by functions of one variable ; adding another arbitrary function - worth of momentum modes to each supertube was argued to break the supersymmetry to four supercharges and result in a superstratum parameterized by arbitrary continuous functions of _ two _ variables . however , as anybody familiar with supertube solutions might easily guess , trying to follow this route brings one rather quickly into a technical quagmire .    a simpler route to prove that superstrata exist is to start from a maximally - rotating supertube solution and try to deform this solution by making the underlying fields and metric wiggle in two directions .",
    "this approach is attractive for several reasons .",
    "first , the holographic dictionary for the ( 8-supercharge ) supercharges . ]",
    "d1-d5 supertubes is well understood @xcite and so , as we will describe later in this paper , we can then generalize this dictionary to the ( 4-supercharge ) d1-d5-p superstrata .",
    "second , the equations that govern the superstrata solutions are well - known @xcite , and can be organized in a linear fashion @xcite , and so this technique appears to be the technique of choice , all the more so because it has enabled the construction of solutions that depend of two arbitrary functions each of which depends upon a different variable @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , while extensive trial and error has led to many solutions that depend on functions of two variables they have all , so far , been singular .",
    "the key ingredient simplifying the task of smoothing the singularities of these solutions is a fourth type of electric field that appears neither in the original five - dimensional @xmath12 ungauged supergravity , where most of the known black hole microstate solutions have been built @xcite , nor in the six - dimensional uplift in @xcite , where the solutions of @xcite were constructed .",
    "the presence of this field can drastically simplify the sources that appear on the right - hand sides of the equations governing the superstratum and allows us to find smooth solutions depending on functions of two variables in closed form .",
    "the solutions with this field can only be embedded in a five - dimensional ungauged supergravity with four or more @xmath13 factors , or in a six - dimensional supergravity with two or more tensor multiplets .",
    "fortunately , the equations underlying the most general supersymmetric solution of the latter theory were found in @xcite and these equations can also be solved following a linear algorithm similar to the one found in @xcite .",
    "the essential role for this fourth type of electric field in the solutions dual to the typical microstates of the d1-d5-p black hole was first revealed by analyzing string emission from the d1-d5-p system @xcite and from d1-d5 precision holography @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was shown that adding this field to certain fluctuating supergravity solutions can make their singularities much milder .",
    "the fact that the extra field plays an important part in both obtaining smooth , fluctuating three - charge geometries and in the description of d1-d5-p string emission processes is , in our opinion , no coincidence , but rather an indication that the solutions we construct are necessary ingredients in the description of the typical microstates of the three - charge black hole .",
    "our plan is to start from a round supertube solution with the fourth electric field turned on and to prove that this solution is part of a family of solutions that is parameterized by functions of two variables .",
    "there are two natural perspectives on these solutions .",
    "the first is to recall that , in the d1-d5 duality frame , the infra - red geometry of the two - charge supertube solution is ads@xmath14 .",
    "this background has three @xmath13 symmetries , which we will parametrize by @xmath15 : @xmath16 corresponds to the d1-d5 common direction , @xmath17 is the gibbons - hawking fiber that comes from writing the @xmath18 in which supertube lives as a gibbons - hawking space and @xmath19 is the angular coordinate in the gibbons - hawking @xmath20 base .",
    "the lunin - mathur two - charge supertube solutions @xcite , as well as their generalizations that have the fourth type of electric field turned on @xcite , correspond to shape deformations of the supertube , and their shapes and charge densities can be viewed as being determined by arbitrary functions of the coordinate @xmath21 .",
    "one can also construct solutions that depend on @xmath16 by simply interchanging @xmath16 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "both these classes of solutions are parameterized by functions of one variable and , as such , correspond to special choices of spherical harmonics on the three - sphere of the round supertube solution .",
    "our superstrata will depend non - trivially upon all three angular coordinates , but only through a two - dimensional lattice of mode numbers ( defined in ( [ modelattice ] ) ) .",
    "the second perspective comes from decomposing the functions of two variables that parametrize our superstratum solutions under the @xmath22 isometry of the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 isometry of the ads@xmath25 .",
    "the shape modes of the two - charge supertube preserve eight supercharges and have @xmath22 quantum numbers @xmath26 and @xmath27 weights @xmath28 ; since @xmath29 determines the spin of the field in the theory , each fourier mode is determined essentially by one quantum number .",
    "thus , these solutions are parameterized by functions of one variable , as expected .",
    "the solutions we construct have four supercharges and correspond to adding left - moving momentum modes to the supertube",
    ". the generic mode will have @xmath30 weight @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath32 is independent of @xmath33 , these will generate intrinsically two - dimensional shape modes on the @xmath23 . since the equations underlying our solutions can be solved using a linear algorithm , superposing multiple spherical harmonics gives rise to very complicated source terms in the equations we are trying to solve .",
    "furthermore , most of the solutions one finds by brute force give rise to singularities . in the earlier construction of microstate geometries ,",
    "such singularities were canceled by adding homogeneous solutions to the equations . here",
    "we will see that this technique does not allow us to obtain smooth solutions from a generic superposition of harmonics on the @xmath23 in all electric fields , and that we have to relate the combinations of spherical harmonics appearing in the electric fields . at the end of the day",
    ", the resulting smooth solutions will contain one general combination of spherical harmonics on a three - sphere , which can be repackaged into an arbitrary continuous function of two variables .",
    "our superstratum can be precisely identified with a state at the free orbifold point of the d1-d5 cft .",
    "the dual cft interpretation , besides providing a crucial guide for the supergravity construction , firmly establishes that our solutions contribute to the entropy of the three - charge black hole , and clarifies what subset of the microstate ensemble is captured by our solutions . in the previous literature , all three - charge geometries with a known cft dual @xcite had been obtained by acting on a two - charge solution ( in the decoupling limit ) with a coordinate transformation that does not vanish at the ads@xmath25 boundary . on the cft side",
    "this is equivalent to acting with an element of the chiral algebra on a ramond - ramond ( rr ) ground state , and produces a state which is identified with a descendant of a chiral primary state in the neveu - schwarz  neveu - schwarz ( nsns ) sector .",
    "in contrast , the microstate solutions we construct here can not be related , generically , to two - charge microstate solutions via a global chiral algebra rotation .",
    "they thus do not correspond to descendants of chiral primaries but represent much more generic states than the ones previously considered in @xcite .    in the interests of full disclosure , while the results presented here represent a major step forward in the microstate geometry programme , it is also very important to indicate what we have not yet achieved .",
    "first , the superstratum solutions we construct in this paper are still rather `` coarsely grained '' in that they do not fully capture states in the twisted sector of the dual cft ( see section [ sect : d1d5cft ] ) . that is , while we do indeed have a superstratum that fluctuates non - trivially as a function of two variables , the fluctuations we construct here are dual to restricted classes of integer - moded current - algebra excitations in the dual cft and so , at present , our superstrata solutions do not have sufficiently many states to capture the black - hole entropy .",
    "thus , we have not yet achieved the `` holy grail '' of the microstate geometry programme .",
    "one should also note that typical states will contain general combinations of fractional - moded excitations in a twisted sector of very high twisting , corresponding to a long effective string of length equal to the product of the numbers of d1 and d5 branes .",
    "this sector of the cft might not be well described within supergravity .",
    "however , to prove the validity of the microstate geometry programme it is sufficient to show the existence of a superstratum which contains general fractional modes in twisted sectors of arbitrary finite order ; this will establish the existence of a mechanism which allows to encode the information of generic states in the geometry . the fact that , in the limit of very large twisting , corrections beyond supergravity might have to be taken into account does not invalidate the existence of such a mechanism .",
    "in particular , we hope that in subsequent work we will be able to refine the mode analysis and the holographic dictionary obtained in this paper and obtain superstrata containing general fractional modes .    the other , more technical issue is that the systematic procedure given in this paper does not yet provide a complete description of the solution for all combinations of fourier modes of the arbitrary function of two variables that parametrizes the superstratum .",
    "as yet , we have not been able to obtain the closed expression for one function that appears in some components of the angular momentum vector . in principle",
    "these could be singular , but we do not expect this , for two reasons : first , we have the general explicit solution for one of the components of the angular momentum vector and this component is regular and , from our experience , if there are singularities in the angular momentum vector they always appear in this particular component . secondly , we have actually been able to find this function and construct the complete solution for several ( infinite ) families of collections of fourier modes .",
    "these families were chosen so as to expose possible singular behaviors and none were found .",
    "thus , while we do not have explicit formulae for one function that appears in the angular momentum vector for all combinations of fourier modes we believe that this is merely a technical limitation rather than a physical impediment .",
    "the construction presented in this paper establishes that the superstratum exists as a bound state object of string theory , and that its supergravity back - reaction gives rise to smooth horizonless three - charge solutions .",
    "having shown this , we believe that a fully generic superstratum is within reach and thus one will be able to show that a finite fraction of the entropy of the bps black hole comes from smooth horizonless solutions .",
    "this , in turn , would imply that the typical states of this black hole will always have a finite component extended along the direction of the hilbert space parameterized by horizonless solutions , and hence will not have a horizon .",
    "thus one would confirm the expectations and goals of the fuzzball / firewall arguments : the horizon of an extremal supersymmetric black hole is not an essential , fundamental component but the result of coarse - graining multiple horizonless configurations .",
    "more broadly , we would like to emphasize that results presented here provide a remarkable confirmation of the power of the approach we have been using to establish that there is structure that replaces the horizon of a black hole : we have directly constructed this structure in supergravity . as we emphasized in @xcite",
    ", this approach could have failed at many different stages throughout its development .",
    "the most recent hurdle has been to show that supergravity has structures that might contain enough states to count the entropy of the black hole .",
    "in @xcite we have argued that this can happen if string theory contains three - charge superstrata solutions that can be parameterized by arbitrary continuous functions of two variables .",
    "the present paper shows explicitly that these solutions exist and furthermore that they are smooth in the duality frame where the black hole has d1,d5 and momentum charges .",
    "( it was the successful clearing of this latest hurdle that led to our somewhat celebratory title for this paper . )",
    "though most of the recent literature on the information paradox has focused on `` alice - and - bob '' gedankenexperiments , we believe that general quantum information arguments about physics at a black - hole horizon will always fall short of resolving the paradox : failure is inevitable without a mechanism to support structure at the horizon scale .",
    "it is remarkable that string theory can provide a natural and beautiful solution to this essential issue and , as was shown in @xcite , microstate geometries provide the _ only _ possible gravitational mechanism and so must be an essential part of the solution to the paradox .",
    "in section  [ sect : supergravity ] we introduce the six - dimensional supergravity theory where our d1-d5-p microstate solutions are constructed and also recall the connection of these solutions to those constructed in the more familiar m2-m2-m2 duality frame .",
    "we write the equations governing the supersymmetric solutions of the six - dimensional supergravity theory in a form that highlights their linear structure and simplify the problem by choosing a flat four - dimensional base space metric .",
    "the equations governing the supersymmetric solutions can then be organized in a first layer of linear equations , which determine the electric and magnetic parts of the gauge fields associated with the d1- and d5-branes , and a second layer of linear but inhomogeneous equations , which determine the momentum and the angular momentum vectors .    in section [",
    "sect : layer1 ] we solve the first layer of equations .",
    "we start from a round d1-d5 supertube carrying density fluctuations of the fourth type of electric field and apply a cft symmetry transformation to generate a two - parameter family of modes that carry the third ( momentum ) charge .",
    "we then use the linearity of the equations to build solutions that contain arbitrary linear combinations of such modes .",
    "section [ sect : layer2 ] contains the most challenging technical part of the superstratum construction : finding the solution of the second layer of equations .",
    "we explain how the sources appearing in these equations have to be fine tuned to avoid singularities of the metric , and how this requirement selects a restricted set of solutions to the first layer of equations .",
    "these solutions are parameterized by certain coefficients that can be interpreted as the fourier coefficients of a function of two variables , which defines the superstratum .",
    "we then construct the general solution for the particular component of the angular momentum 1-form that , from our experience , controls the existence of closed timelike curves .",
    "we also find in section [ sect : examples ] the remaining components of this 1-form , thus deriving the complete solution for several ( infinite ) families of collections of fourier modes .",
    "we verify the regularity of the solutions in these examples .",
    "although we mostly work in the `` decoupling '' regime , in which geometries are asymptotic to ads@xmath34 , in section [ sect : physics ] we present a way to extend our solutions and obtain asymptotically five - dimensional ( @xmath35 ) superstrata geometries .",
    "we also derive the asymptotic charges and angular momenta of these geometries .",
    "these results are then used in section [ sect : d1d5cft ] to motivate the identification of the states dual to the superstrata at the free orbifold point of the d1-d5 cft .",
    "we point out that states dual to our superstrata are descendants of non - chiral primaries and we show how some of the features of the gravity solution have a natural explanation in the dual cft .",
    "section [ sect : concl ] summarizes the relevance of our construction for the black - hole microstate geometry programme and highlights possible future developments .",
    "several technical results are collected in the appendices . in appendix [ appendix:2charge ]",
    "we recall the form of general two - charge microstates and in appendix [ appendix : recursion ] we explain how to use a recursion relation to solve some of the differential equations of the second layer .    readers who are not so interested in the gory technical details of our solutions can simply read sections  [ sect : supergravity ] and [ sect : layer1 ] in order to understand the supergravity structure that we use in constructing the explicit superstratum solution , and read section [ sect : d1d5cft ] in order to understand the corresponding states in the dual cft .",
    "the existence of the superstratum was originally conjectured based upon an analysis of supersymmetric bound states within string theory .",
    "the ( ) exotic branes of string theory were thoroughly analyzed in @xcite , where it was also argued that objects carrying dipole charges corresponding to such branes can result from simple or double supertube transitions .",
    "in @xcite it was pointed out that the hallmark of these bound state objects is that they are locally , but when they bend to form a supertube they break some of the supersymmetry .",
    "in particular the objects that result from a simple supertube transition are and are parameterized by arbitrary functions of one variable , while the objects that result from a double supertube transition are and are parameterized by arbitrary functions of two variables .",
    "as explained in @xcite , most of the double supertube transitions result in objects carrying exotic brane charges , which are therefore non - geometric .",
    "however , in @xcite it was pointed out that when d1 branes , d5 branes and momentum undergo a double supertube transitions the resulting object is not only geometric but also potentially giving rise to a class of smooth microstate geometries parameterized by arbitrary functions of two variables .",
    "this object became known as the _ superstratum_. thus , this fundamental bound state in string theory could , as a microstate geometry , provide a very large semi - classical contribution to the black - hole entropy .",
    "indeed it was argued in @xcite that a fully generic superstratum could capture the entropy to at least the same parametric growth with charges as that of the three - charge black hole .",
    "thus the construction of a completely generic superstratum has become a central goal of the microstate geometry programme .",
    "the supertube transitions that yield the superstratum were analyzed in detail in @xcite and it was shown that indeed such solitons could be given shape modes as a function of _ two _ variables while remaining .",
    "based on the forms of these supertube transitions it was argued that the resulting geometry should be smooth but this remained to be substantiated through computation of the fully - back - reacted geometries in supergravity . since this initial conjecture , much progress has been made in finding the supergravity description of the superstratum .",
    "the structure of the bps equations led to the construction of doubly fluctuating , but singular bps , `` superthreads and supersheets '' in @xcite .",
    "simple but very restricted classes of superstrata were obtained in @xcite . in parallel with this",
    ", string amplitudes were used to very considerable effect to find the key perturbative components of the superstratum @xcite .",
    "the fact that the bps equations underlying the superstratum are largely linear @xcite means that knowledge of the perturbative pieces can be sufficient for generating the complete solution . finally , in an apparently unrelated investigation of new classes of microstate geometries @xcite and",
    "new families of black - ring solutions @xcite , a mechanism arising out of the perturbative superstrata programme was used to resolve singularities and find new physical solutions .",
    "we are now in a position to pull all these threads together and obtain , for the first time , a non - trivial , fully - back - reacted smooth supergravity superstratum that fluctuates as a function of two variables .",
    "we begin by reviewing the basic supergravity equations that need to be solve , starting in the d1-d5-p duality frame and discussing how this reduces to an analysis within six - dimensional supergravity .",
    "while we will be working with the @xmath0 compactification of iib supergravity to six dimensions , it is important to note that in our supergravity solutions only the volume of @xmath0 is dynamical and thereby we work with @xmath36 supergravity theory in six dimensions without vector multiplets .",
    "this implies that all our supergravity results may be trivially ported to iib supergravity on @xmath1 .",
    "the general solution of type iib supergravity compactified on @xmath37 that preserves the same supercharges as the d1-d5-p system and is invariant under rotations of @xmath0 has the form ( * ? ? ?",

    "three - charge microstate geometries are expected to be smooth only in the d1-d5-p duality frame , in which we exclusively work in this paper .",
    "however , it is useful to make connection to other duality frames that are probably more familiar to the reader , in particular the m - theory frame in which all the electric charges are on the same footing and described by m2-branes .",
    "moreover , by compactifying m - theory on @xmath61 and truncating the spectrum one can understand much of the structure of the solutions in terms of five - dimensional , @xmath62 supergravity coupled to @xmath63 vector multiplets .",
    "however , it is important to note that the m - theory and d1-d5-p frames are different in one crucial respect : @xmath16-dependent solutions in the d1-d5-p frame , which are essential ingredients of the superstratum conjecture , are not describable in the m - theory frame , because the t - duality along the common d1-d5 direction , which connects the two frames , transforms @xmath16-dependent solutions into solutions that contain higher kk harmonics and therefore can not be described by supergravity . therefore , for the purposes of the current paper , the m - theory picture explained here should be regarded as a book - keeping device to understand the degrees of freedom appearing in the general three - charge geometries .",
    "we will work in the d1-d5-p frame except for this subsection .",
    "in the five - dimensional description , including the graviphoton , there are thus @xmath64 five - dimensional vector fields , @xmath65 , encoded in the eleven - dimensional three - form potential @xmath66 , and the scalars @xmath67 , encoded in the khler form @xmath68 for the compact six - dimensional space  @xcite : @xmath69 here , @xmath70 are harmonic @xmath71-forms on the compact six - dimensional space that are invariant under the projection performing the @xmath62 truncation . in addition",
    "the @xmath67 s satisfy the constraint @xmath72 where @xmath73 is given by the intersection product among the @xmath74 , so only @xmath63 scalars are independent . here",

    "if we parametrize the @xmath61 by the holomorphic coordinates : @xmath75 then the requisite forms are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath76 , @xmath77 . 5    however , we will only need the subset of these : @xmath78 in this basis , the only non - zero components of @xmath73 are @xmath79 where @xmath80 the standard `` stu '' supergravity corresponds to setting @xmath81 and retaining @xmath65 , @xmath82 , with @xmath83 being the graviphoton .",
    "the degrees of freedom in our particular examples of a superstratum correspond to the presence of one extra vector multiplet and this involves identifying in the fourth and fifth sets of fields : @xmath84 and @xmath85 as in @xcite .    in the `` stu '' model , the standard route ( see , for example ,",
    "the appendices in @xcite ) for getting from the iib frame to the m - theory frame is to perform t - dualities on @xmath86 and then to uplift the resulting iia description to eleven dimensions . in the iib solution",
    "there are four independent scalar functions ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 )",
    "whose ratios correspond to the scalars in the vector multiplets .",
    "the fourth function represents a convenient way of writing the warp factor of the five - dimensional metric as a relaxation of the constraint ( [ tconstraint ] ) : @xmath90 in our particular class of solutions with ( [ recc ] ) and ( [ hatcform ] ) we have @xmath91 where @xmath92 and we identified @xmath84 .",

    ", the degrees of freedom of the iib solution   require an extra vector multiplet . in order to map the iib configuration in the m - theory frame",
    "one needs a slightly more complicated combination of t - dualities and one s - duality  @xcite .",
    "however the final result is very similar to that of the `` stu '' model , with the scalar @xmath103 and vector @xmath104 forming the new vector multiplet .",
    "one can also uplift the five - dimensional description given here to @xmath105 supergravity in six dimensions .",
    "this is more appropriate for our solution , since this formulation allows @xmath16-dependent solutions .",
    "indeed , the six - dimensional formulation is the @xmath0 reduction of the iib description in section [ ss : ansatz ] . in the uplift ,",
    "the five - dimensional graviton multiplet combines with one of the vector multiplets to yield the six - dimensional graviton multiplet , while all the remaining vector multiplets become anti - self - dual tensor multiplets .",
    "thus the `` stu '' model corresponds to minimal @xmath105 supergravity ( whose bosonic sector consists of a graviton , @xmath106 , and a self - dual tensor gauge field , @xmath107 ) plus a tensor multiplet ( whose bosonic sector consists of an anti - self - dual tensor gauge field , @xmath108 , and a scalar , @xmath42 ) .",
    "the bps equations for these systems were obtained in @xcite and were fully analyzed and greatly simplified in @xcite . to build our solutions we need to add an extra anti - self - dual tensor multiplet and the corresponding analysis of the bps equations",

    "we will see in section  [ sect : d1d5cft ] that this happens because the operator @xmath250 annihilates the two - charge state if @xmath251 .",
    "the reflection of this fact on the gravity side is that the functions @xmath252 are obviously singular for @xmath253 if @xmath251 and thus should not appear in physically allowed solutions . hence the modes , @xmath254 and @xmath255 , are only allowed if @xmath249 .",
    "note that , for these modes , the functions multiplying the @xmath256-dependent trigonometric functions vanish fast enough to avoid singularities at @xmath190 according to the criterion discussed at the beginning of section  [ sect : layer2 ] .",
    "in the rigidly - generated solution , the coefficients with which the terms @xmath254 appear in the total @xmath103 are not all independent , but are fixed functions of a single parameter , the rotation angle @xmath248 .",
    "( @xmath257 ) for which all coefficients apart from those of the terms with @xmath258 vanish : this shows that solutions where @xmath103 contains only modes with @xmath258 are descendants of two - charge states . ]",
    "the beauty of the solution generating technique is that it provides us with all the modes we need to solve the first layer of the bps equations ; indeed , one can explicitly check that _ each individual mode _ given by and solves the first layer of equations , .",
    "these modes depend upon two integers , @xmath259 , and provide an expansion basis for generic functions of two variables on the @xmath23 .",
    "so , as far as this layer of the problem is concerned , we can take advantage of the linearity of the bps system and consider solutions in which @xmath260 are linear combinations of @xmath254 , @xmath255 with _ arbitrary _ coefficients : @xmath261 @xmath262 where @xmath263 and @xmath264 compared to  , we have added a mode - dependent constant phase - shift in the definition of @xmath265 , so that can be thought of as the general fourier expansion of @xmath103 .",
    "we can think of @xmath266 as the fourier coefficients of a function of two variables since these modes are related to the @xmath189 and @xmath267 coordinates .    similarly , for the other pairs @xmath268 and @xmath269 , a general class of solutions is given by    [ zithetajfull ] @xmath270    ( for @xmath271 ) , where @xmath272 , @xmath273 @xmath274 are new sets of arbitrary fourier coefficients .",
    "we could also introduce new , independent phase constants , @xmath275 , in ( [ zithetajfull ] ) .",
    "we have thus found a quite general class of solutions to the first layer of bps equations ( [ eqz1theta2])([eqz4theta4 ] ) , that can be parameterized by several arbitrary functions of two variables .",
    "as far as the first layer of equations go , the functions  are solutions , however , it still remains to solve the second layer of equations and impose regularity on the full geometry .",
    "we will discuss this in detail in examples in section [ sect : examples ] , but we will not tackle this problem in full generality in this paper . our goal here is to show that there are microstate geometries that fluctuate as a generic function of two variables . to that end , we will simplify the problem by using further insights from the rigidly - generated solution discussed in section [ ss : particularsoln ] and constraining the form of the fourier expansions in , to obtain a relatively simple family of superstrata solutions .      in this paper we will make an ansatz in which the fourier expansions for @xmath276 and @xmath277 are determined in terms of the fourier expansion of @xmath278 . because the @xmath266 will remain arbitrary , this will still represent a solution that depends on a function of two variables . for simplicity , we will set all the phase constants to zero : @xmath279 .",
    "our ansatz is inspired by the rigidly - generated three - charge solution in subsection [ ss : particularsoln ] .",
    "first , one finds that this rigidly - generated solution actually leaves @xmath98 and @xmath280 unchanged from the two - charge solution .",
    "thus , we also assume that @xmath98 is not deformed and remains as it is in the two - charge solution ( [ supertubeplus ] ) .",
    "then , ( [ eqz2theta1 ] ) implies @xmath280 .",
    "so , we set @xmath281 namely , we set @xmath282 for all @xmath283 .",
    "again , drawing inspiration from the two - charge seed solution ( [ supertubeplus ] ) , one would expect @xmath97 to have @xmath16-dependent terms that are quadratic in @xmath266 ( namely , @xmath284 will be quadratic in @xmath266 ) . a first guess",
    "( which will be further substantiated by our analysis in section  [ sect : layer2 ] ) would be to adjust these terms in such a way that @xmath285 be non - oscillating .",
    "however , one can immediately see that when @xmath103 contains more than one mode this is not possible ; the product of @xmath286 and @xmath287 has the form @xmath288 the first term is precisely of the form of the terms that can appear in the mode expansion ( [ zithetajfull ] ) of @xmath289 , but the second term is not of this form . in @xmath285 , it is thus possible to cancel all the terms proportional to the mode @xmath290 , but the modes @xmath291 will remain . as we will see below , arranging this partial cancellation appears to be an important part of regularity of the solution .",
    "these observations motivate the following ansatz : @xmath292\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath293 are coefficients that we will fix by requiring regularity .",
    "the ansatz for the 2-form , @xmath132 , corresponding to this form of @xmath97 is precisely the appropriate parallel of ( [ theta4full ] ) : @xmath294\\,,\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which indeed satisfies ( [ eqz1theta2 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the coefficients @xmath293 are non - vanishing only when the mode @xmath295 is allowed : for this one needs @xmath296 ; if we assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath297 , one also needs @xmath298 .",
    "as we will see below , the value of the @xmath293 will be determined in such a way that the angular - momentum one - form , @xmath144 , is regular at the center of the @xmath18 base space of the solution .",
    "the parameter @xmath230 appearing in the non - oscillating part of @xmath97 has its origins in the terms with @xmath299 and @xmath300 , and @xmath230 will be fixed by the regularity of the metric at the supertube position @xmath301 .",
    "to completely specify the ten - dimensional geometry one must first solve the second layer of the equations , ( [ eqomega ] ) and ( [ eqcalf ] ) , and thereby obtain expressions for the one - form , @xmath144 , which encodes the angular momentum , and the function , @xmath145 , associated with the momentum charge . having done this , one must also impose whatever constraints are necessary to achieve regularity .",
    "one of our early concerns was that , given our assumptions about the @xmath16-independence of the base metric and the one - form , @xmath95 , the regularity constraints might show that there are no generic superstrata in this class .",
    "however , the solution - generating techniques show that there must be at least a family of non - trivial solutions that are obtained from rotations of generic shape modes of the d1-d5 configurations",
    ". such a family would still only be parameterized by functions of one variable , but our approach is more general : we have used the solution - generating techniques to find modes that solve the first layer of equations and we now take arbitrary linear superpositions of them to generate new families of solutions . in this and the next sections , we will demonstrate that this approach indeed leads to a ( smooth ) superstratum that fluctuates as a generic function of two variables . as will become evident ,",
    "this is technically the hardest part of the construction and so we will try to break the problem into manageable pieces before going into generalities .",
    "in this section we outline the general structure of the equations that @xmath144 and @xmath145 must satisfy , and then , in the subsequent section , we will give explicit examples illustrating the cancellation of singularities to demonstrate the existence of families of smooth solutions .",
    "here we concentrate on the regularity constraints that come from the behavior of the metric at the center of @xmath18 , which in our coordinates is at @xmath302 . at this point",
    "the angular coordinates @xmath303 degenerate , and if a tensor depends on these coordinates and/or has legs along these angular directions , it might be singular even without exhibiting an explicit divergence .",
    "the conditions for regularity are analogous to the ones at the center of the plane in polar coordinates .",
    "another possible source of singularities are the terms diverging at the supertube location @xmath304 .",
    "the singularity analysis at this location parallels the one of two - charge solutions and we leave it to section [ sect : physics ] .",
    "we begin with the general mode expansions where @xmath268 , @xmath277 and gradually proceed to our specific ansatz  in which the fourier coefficients in @xmath268 , @xmath277 have restricted forms .",
    "equations ( [ eqomega ] ) and ( [ eqcalf ] ) form a linear system of differential equations for @xmath144 and @xmath145 , and the source term on the right hand side is a quadratic combination of @xmath88 and @xmath306 where @xmath89 . in general ,",
    "each of @xmath88 and @xmath306 is a sum over modes labeled by @xmath259 and so the source term will be a product of two modes .",
    "linearity means that one can solve these equations independently for each such pair of modes .",
    "we will denote the contribution to @xmath144 and @xmath145 coming from the product of two modes @xmath307 and @xmath308 by @xmath309 and @xmath310 . thus @xmath144 and @xmath145 have the following general form : @xmath311 where @xmath312 is the contribution of the round supertube .",
    "the product formula of trigonometric functions means that the @xmath16- , @xmath267- and @xmath189-dependence of @xmath309 and @xmath310 will either involve the sum or the difference of the source phases : @xmath290 or @xmath291 .",
    "again , linearity means that we may address such pieces separately , so let us analyze the solution of  ( [ eqomega ] ) and  ( [ eqcalf ] ) for an arbitrary mode whose phase is @xmath313 .",

    "this operator is a scalar under rotations of the @xmath0 and carries @xmath551 , so that the new strands have quantum numbers @xmath552 and are also invariant under @xmath18 rotations .",

    "limit : in general the dual state is a linear combination of many terms , that is peaked around the configuration described in the text , with a spread determined by the coefficients @xmath187 and @xmath230 . ]",

    ", the momentum is carried by all possible types of excitation that are available in the cft and , in particular , on a strand of length @xmath224 , we can have modes of the free boson and fermion fields carrying a fractional quantum of momentum in units of the inverse of the radius @xmath178 .",
    "the usual orbifold rules only constrain the total momentum on each strand to be integer - valued .    for general momentum - carrying states on a strand",
    ", it seems quite non - trivial to determine the precise correspondence between the frequency with which the strand appears in the cft state and the deformation parameter of the supergravity data .",
    "however , for the particular ansatz we consider here , the dictionary is simple enough and can be inferred from the data we have collected .",
    "as discussed in the gravity part of this paper , we have focussed on a class of states in which the momentum excitations are the operators @xmath568 acting on different groups of @xmath556 strands ( recall that the subscript @xmath513 means that this operator belongs to the @xmath508 strand ) .",
    "this is the same type of strand that , in absence of momentum carrying excitations , is related to the @xmath547 component of the profile  .",
    "thus it is natural to relate the presence of this type of strand to the presence of a term @xmath254 ( see ) in the supergravity solution . as a consistency check ,",
    "if we set @xmath569 , then this correctly reduces to the dictionary discussed above for the states : on the cft side this kills the momentum - carrying excitations and on the gravity side we recover the solution which can be obtained from the profile from   by using the general relations summarized in  .",
    "it is now straightforward to characterize the states that are dual to the superstrata geometries we constructed : it is sufficient to look at the form of @xmath103 in   and interpret each term of the sum as indicating the presence of @xmath570 strands ( on average ) of the type @xmath552 with @xmath334 units of momentum carried by @xmath571^m / m!$ ] , with @xmath572 we will also identify the number of strands of the type @xmath542 with @xmath573 .",
    "the numerical factors are suggested by the supergravity expressions for the charges derived in section  [ sect : physics ] .",
    "first , in our superstratum state the average numbers of strands of winding @xmath224 multiplied by @xmath224 should sum up to the total number of cft copies : @xmath574~.\\ ] ] this relation matches  .",
    "also the angular momentum charges   can be easily checked from the microscopic picture : only the first type of strands in figure  [ fig : rr_gnd2 ] carries right - moving angular momentum .",
    "since the number of such strands is proportional to @xmath553 , this matches the second relation in  .",
    "the first relation in this equation follows from the fact that strands with @xmath571^m$ ] in figure  [ fig : rr_gnd2 ] carry @xmath334 units of left - moving angular momentum @xmath33 , while the fermion zero modes of the strand @xmath555 contribute @xmath575 each to @xmath33 .",
    "similarly ,   is consistent with the fact the operator @xmath571^m$ ] adds @xmath334 units of momentum on each strand where it acts .",
    "indeed , shows that one quantum of momentum is associated with one quantum of angular momentum and so each such quantum must be created by some @xmath576 .",
    "the identification between each single term @xmath254 and the presence of many copies of an excited type of strand is also supported by some general properties of the momentum - carrying operator we used . for instance , by using the free orbifold description of the cft it is possible to see that @xmath571^m$ ] vanishes when it acts on a strand of length @xmath224 if @xmath251 .",
    "this can be easily verified in the orbifold cft .",
    "one can simply note that this is a standard null vector identity in a current algebra of level @xmath224 , or one can use   and   directly .",
    "the terms in @xmath568 that act non - trivially on the @xmath556 strands have the form @xmath577 with @xmath578 ; so in @xmath571^m$ ] with @xmath251 at least one fermionic creation operator appears twice , which implies that only strands with @xmath579 are possible .",
    "as one can see from equation   exactly the same constraint arises on the supergravity side as a regularity condition for @xmath252 .",
    "another check that one can perform is to choose very particular values for the parameters defining the superstratum states so as to reconstruct a descendant state .",
    "for instance , in figure  [ fig : rr_gnd2 ] we can consider just a single type of momentum - carrying strand with @xmath258 . by generalizing the cft analysis of  @xcite , one can check that this is a descendant obtained by choosing @xmath257 in the rotation of section  [ ss : newmodes ]",
    ". then the ( average ) number of momentum - carrying strands has to be equal to the ( average ) number of @xmath556 strands in the seed two - charge geometry of section  [ ss : seed ] , as it can be seen by putting @xmath258 in  .",
    "the main message of this construction is that the linearized ( in the parameters @xmath266 ) expression for the scalar fields @xmath580 is sufficient to identify the dual state on the cft side . on the bulk side",
    "the supergravity equations allow one ( at least for this class of states ) to find the explicit non - linear solutions . at this point",
    "it is possible to further check the dictionary between cft states and geometries by comparing the expectation values for the protected operators as it was done for the solutions in  @xcite and for their descendants in  @xcite .    _",

    "the three - charge geometries with a precise cft dual that have been known prior to this paper @xcite have been obtained by a solution - generating technique @xcite that amounts to applying @xmath151-symmetry generators such as @xmath564 on states .",
    "this procedure can only generate an extremely restricted class of momentum - carrying states . in technical terms , one can only obtain the @xmath151-current descendants of chiral primaries . ] in contrast",
    ", our geometries correspond to descendants of _ non - chiral primaries _ and specifically , states generated by the small current algebras , ( [ jdefn ] ) , on different types of strand . our approach thus yields completely new , broad classes of solutions .    from the cft perspective , the way we have achieved this can be described more precisely as follows : our three - charge states , such as the one described in figure [ fig : rr_gnd2 ] , are composed of multiple strands , in each of which we have applied the modes @xmath582 on a ground state (= chiral primary )",
    ". such a strand on its own can be thought of as representing a descendant of a chiral primary .",
    "however , when we have two or more strands , the full state is a tensor product of descendants of chiral primaries .",
    "now recall that , although the tensor product of chiral primaries is again a chiral primary , the tensor product of descendants of chiral primaries is in general a descendant of a _ non - chiral primary _ @xcite . therefore , a multi - strand state in general represents a descendant of a non - chiral primary .",
    "this is because a tensor product of strands each of which is acted by @xmath582 can not generally be written as the @xmath151-symmetry generator @xmath583 acting on a chiral primary , except for special states in which numbers of different types of strand are tuned in some precise way .",
    "we can see the same physics from the supergravity perspective : in our solution we allowed for arbitrary coefficients @xmath266 in the linear combination in  .",
    "this means that , in general , it will not be possible to rewrite the solution as an element of the @xmath151-symmetry group , which is an exponential of the operator @xmath584 , acting on a two - charge solution (= chiral primary ) .",
    "descendant states such as the `` rigidly - generated '' solution discussed in subsection [ ss : particularsoln ] or those considered in  @xcite appear as special cases where the coefficients of the various terms in the expression for the @xmath88 are chosen in a precise way that allows one to reconstruct the currents @xmath515 .",
    "first and foremost we have constructed an example of a superstratum with sufficient genericity to substantiate the claim that the superstratum exists within supergravity as a smooth solution parameterized by at least one function of two variables .",
    "this , in itself , represents huge progress within the programme of reproducing the black - hole entropy by counting microstate geometries that are valid in the same regime of parameters where the classical black hole solution exists , and is cause enough for the `` white smoke '' and celebration suggested by this paper s title . at a more technical level we have given an algorithm that can be effectively implemented to generate shape modes of the superstratum .",
    "we have also begun to develop a systematic picture of the holographic duals of our superstrata and the results presented here contain several important new results : up until now , all the three - charge geometries constructed by solution generating methods starting from two - centered geometries @xcite were dual to descendants of _ _ chiral primary states__. ] in the left - moving sector of the d1-d5 cft . to obtain the most general state one must be able to find the gravity duals of arbitrary left - moving states : descendants of _ non - chiral primaries_. we have shown how such states are indeed being captured by the superstratum .    our focus in this paper has been to exhibit one example of a superstratum rather than attempt an analysis of the possible families of superstrata . as a result",
    "we have passed over many interesting and important physical and mathematical issues that arise from our construction and we would like to catalog some of them .    we begin with the interpretation of our work in terms of the cft . in @xcite , three of the present authors conjectured that the fluctuations of the superstratum that are visible in six - dimensional supergravity correspond to current algebra excitations of the cft .",
    "the current algebra in question is generated by the modes @xmath585 of ( [ jdefn ] ) acting on _ individual _ strands labeled by @xmath513 , and the associated sector of the cft has central charge @xmath586 which is large enough to reproduce the asymptotic growth of the entropy of the three - charge black hole .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the @xmath151-symmetry algebra generated by the total @xmath587 whose central charge is merely @xmath588 .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the fluctuation modes of the superstratum and reproduce the black - hole entropy growth , it is crucial to study how individual generators @xmath585 are realized in supergravity and whether they generate smooth geometries .",
    "the solution generating technique that was used in the literature @xcite to obtain smooth three - charge solutions starting from two - center geometries constructs solutions that are descendants of a chiral primary by the action of the total generator @xmath589 , and thus does not allow one to change independently each individual @xmath585 .",
    "however , by taking a tensor product of such descendant states , which corresponds in supergravity to taking a linear superposition , a classical configuration with amplitude @xmath590 corresponds to the coherent state @xmath591 .",
    "if one has two oscillators with @xmath187 and @xmath230 , the classical configuration in which the @xmath187 oscillator with amplitude @xmath590 and the @xmath230 oscillator with amplitude @xmath95 are classically superposed corresponds to the tensor product state @xmath592 . ] and non - linearly completing it , we successfully constructed smooth momentum - carrying geometries dual to states that are not the result of acting on chiral primaries with the total @xmath589 but intrinsically involve individual generators @xmath582 .",
    "these explicit solutions demonstrate that the action of some individual generators are indeed realized as smooth geometries .",
    "we regard this as evidence in support of the conjecture that there exist smooth supergravity solutions realizing the entire @xmath586 current algebra generated by the individual generators @xmath585 .",
    "furthermore , the fact that our solutions involve two parameters @xmath283 suggests that the general fluctuation of the superstratum is described by functions of at least two variables , as claimed in @xcite .",
    "although this represents major progress toward showing that the action of the full algebra of individual generators @xmath585 gives smooth superstrata in gravity , there are still two more steps needed to achieve this goal : one must study how _ higher _ generators @xmath593 with @xmath594 are realized in supergravity .",
    "furthermore , on a strand of length @xmath224 , we can have _ fractional _ generators @xmath595 with @xmath596 ; we must also study the bulk realizations of these modes . on a strand of length @xmath597 , higher modes can account for the three - charge black hole entropy growth @xmath598 if @xmath599 , while on a strand of length @xmath600 , fractional modes can account for the entropy growth if @xmath601 . therefore ,",
    "either higher modes or fractional modes are separately sufficient to reproduce the three - charge black hole entropy for large enough @xmath483 .",
    "we can look at these issues with the modes @xmath585 from a different angle .",
    "as we have argued , the smooth geometries we have constructed represent the tensor product of the descendants obtained by acting on chiral primaries with the specific generator , @xmath582 .",
    "actually , the tower of descendant states built using @xmath582 on a chiral primary have a bulk interpretation as states of a supergraviton @xcite . when there are multiple supergravitons , the total state is the tensor product of such supergraviton states .",
    "therefore , the smooth geometries constructed in this paper must correspond to the states of a supergraviton gas in the bulk .",
    "more precisely , our geometries can be regarded as coherent states in the multi - particle hilbert space of supergravitons .",
    "conversely , we expect that the quantization of our solutions reproduce the multi - particle supergraviton hilbert space around ads@xmath34 .",
    "and supercurrent generators , which we did not consider in this paper . to reproduce the full hilbert space",
    ", one needs to include the bulk geometries generated by these generators too . ]",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the supergravity elliptic genus computed by counting these supergravitons , with a stringy exclusion principle imposed by hand , agrees with the cft elliptic genus in the parameter region @xmath602 , or in the r sector , @xmath603 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] . ) in other words , in this parameter region , it has been shown that every cft state has a bulk realization as a multi - supergraviton state , modulo the fact that some states are missed because elliptic genus counts states with signs ( it is only an index ) .",
    "therefore , our geometries must be giving the bulk semi - classical description of all cft states in this parameter region ( again , modulo possibly missed states ) .",
    "however , this observation also illuminates what states our solutions fail to capture .",
    "the results in @xcite imply that , above the bound @xmath604 , the supergraviton gas is not enough to account for the cft states . by construction ,",
    "the supergraviton gas includes neither higher nor fractional modes and so we need these modes to reproduce the entropy above the bound . in particular , because single - center supersymmetric black holes ( the bmpv black hole @xcite ) exist above the bound , we certainly need to understand superstratum realizations of higher and/or fractional modes to reproduce entropy of this black hole . actually , the story is even more interesting , since in @xcite it was shown that there are multi - center black holes ( `` moulting black holes '' ) even below the bound .",
    "these black holes must correspond to higher and/or fractional modes that are not visible in the elliptic genus because of cancellations between bosonic and fermionic states .",
    "therefore , understanding superstratum realizations of higher and/or fractional modes are important also for understanding the microstates of moulting black hole configurations .",
    "the microstates of the moulting black holes may be promising for studying higher and fractional modes , because they exist even in the neighborhood of pure ads@xmath34 ( @xmath605 ) .",
    "presumably , we can study those modes by looking at small deformations around ads@xmath34 .",

    "are based on the action of the generators @xmath610 . to go beyond this",
    ", we must understand supergravity realizations of @xmath611 with @xmath612 ( higher modes ) and @xmath613 ( fractional modes ) .",
    "the total generators @xmath614 are realized in the bulk by dressing @xmath615 with a @xmath16-dependent exponential factor @xmath616 @xcite . in general",
    ", the action of the total @xmath617 makes all kinds of quantities @xmath16-dependent , including the base metric @xmath618 and the 1-form @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the individual generators , @xmath611 , must also produce a complicated @xmath16-dependence in the solution .",
    "in particular , the new parameter , @xmath63 , introduced by this procedure is expected to generalize the phase @xmath265 in to @xmath619 depending on three parameters and lead to a much broader class of three - charge solutions .",
    "clearly , it is particularly important to understand how the fractional modes @xmath620 , which exist on strands of length @xmath621 , are encoded in supergravity . for @xmath622 ,",
    "the fractional modes mean that the bulk geometry must have an energy gap as low as @xmath623 .",
    ", because supersymmetry means that the excitation energy is equal to the momentum number which is quantized to integers .",
    "non - bps excitations , on the other hand , are not subject to such constraints and their energy gap can be as small as @xmath624 . ]",
    "furthermore , much of the three - charge entropy comes from excitations on strands with @xmath625 .",
    "although we have superstrata with shape modes that are intrinsically two - dimensional , the actual modes studied here _ do not _ have the very low energy gap @xmath626 . in the gravity",
    "dual , excitations with this energy gap are known to come from fluctuations of `` deep , scaling '' geometries in which the wavelength of the fluctuation is approximately the scale of the horizon @xcite .",
    "there are thus two ways we might find such superstrata : one could consider a single , large superstratum with a large dipole moment , @xmath224 , and hence a very large order , @xmath627 , orbifold singularity and then allow multi - valued functions with the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "( of course , multi - valued excitations are not allowed in supergravity and therefore they must be excited multiple times so that their wavefunction is single - valued . )",
    "while such a configuration is technically singular , its physical meaning is still understandable .",
    "alternatively , one could `` completely bubble '' such a configuration to a @xmath224-centered configuration and then the lowest energy fluctuation will be some collective mode of all the bubbles in this configuration in some deep scaling limit . while the latter would have no orbifold singularities , its lack of symmetry might make analytical computations prohibitively hard .    more generally , there remains an important conceptual issue in microstate geometries : we know how to obtain modes with the energy gaps @xmath626 in both the d1-d5 cft and in the deep , scaling holographic dual geometries , but a detailed understanding of precisely how these dual states are related remains unknown . as indicated above , part of the story must involve resolving orbifold singularities and multi - valued functions but , on the gravity side , it must also involve deep scaling geometries .",
    "we would very much like to understand the emergence of such scaling geometries from the detailed matching in the holographic dictionary .",
    "understanding this issue is going to be an essential part of seeing how the cft entropy is encoded in the bulk geometry .    in the construction presented here",
    "we also encountered new types of singularities that are more difficult to remove than the singularities that appear in the standard construction of five - dimensional microstate geometries . in the latter ,",
    "the removal of singularities was related to the removal of closed time - like curves and this could be achieved by adjusting the choices of homogeneous solutions to the linear system of equations underlying the bps solutions . here",
    "we have found that the choice of homogeneous solutions is insufficient for the task of singularity removal : one also has to interrelate the otherwise independent sets of fluctuations in order to obtain non - singular solutions .",
    "we also noted that these interrelationships are very similar to those required for smooth horizons in black rings with fluctuating charge densities @xcite .",
    "the physical origins and the resolutions of these potential singularities remains unclear and in this paper we simply exploited a mathematical algorithm to remove such singularities .",
    "we would like to understand the origins of such singularities , classify the ways in which one can cancel them and see if there is , indeed , some physical link of this to black - ring horizon smoothness .    in this paper",
    "we have also focused on superstrata that are asymptotic to ads@xmath628 .",
    "this choice was made for two reasons : simplicity and holography .",
    "the removal of singularities is simpler if the space is asymptotic to ads@xmath628 and such asymptotics is all one needs for the study of the states that are holographically dual to our superstrata .",
    "more generally , we would like to construct and classify superstrata that are asymptotic to @xmath629 or @xmath630 .",
    "this means that constant terms need to be introduced into some of the metric functions .",
    "as noted in section [ sect : physics ] , the constructions of such solutions should involve only straightforward technical issues rather than serious conceptual or physical issues .",
    "indeed , such solutions will be investigated in @xcite .",
    "there are also some other interesting technical issues in the mathematics of superstrata .",
    "first , we found in sections [ sect : layer2 ] and [ sect : examples ] that regularity required our fourier coefficients to satisfy a quadratic constraint and that constraint came from canceling a class of terms appearing in the quadratic @xmath234 .",
    "motivated by solution generating methods @xcite we chose to do this by leaving @xmath98 and @xmath131 unmodified ( see ( [ z2full ] ) ) and adjusting the modes of @xmath97 and @xmath132 to cancel the problematic terms arising out of @xmath631 .",
    "if one allows for a general set of modes in @xmath98 and @xmath131 then there are presumably many more ways to satisfy the quadratic constraints and hence more allowed excitations of the superstratum .",
    "as we also noted , one must furthermore revisit the quadratic constraint on fourier coefficients if one is to construct superstrata in asymptotically flat geometries and so we intend to analyze this constraint more completely in @xcite .",
    "the second technical issue has to do with the existence of a systematic approach to solving the system of differential equations underlying our solutions .",
    "we have been in this paper able to completely solve for all the fields of the solution in closed form except for one function appearing in some of the components of the angular momentum vector and if we could find the function we miss we could find @xmath632 and @xmath633 independently , and then solve for @xmath634 and @xmath635 algebraically . ] .",
    "the two - centered system leads to some relatively simple differential operators and , in particular , the laplacian ( [ lapop2 ] ) is separable .",
    "the sources are also relatively simple functions and we have managed to find complete analytic solutions for some infinite families of sources .",
    "our explicit solutions are also polynomials in simple functions of @xmath318 and @xmath188 .",
    "all of this suggests that there must be a far more systematic approach to solving this system of differential equations .",
    "indeed , we strongly suspect that the whole mathematical problem we have been solving in section [ sect : layer2 ] should have a much simpler formulation and solution in terms of some cleverly chosen orthogonal polynomials .",
    "understanding this may , in turn , lead to a clearer understanding of the whole system of differential equations and maybe even a reformulation of the general solution , perhaps even for multi - centered solutions , in terms of green functions .",
    "furthermore , solving this problem should enable the complete analytic construction of the most general superstratum based on two centers .",
    "work on this is also continuing .",

    "<S> we construct the first example of a superstratum : a class of smooth horizonless supergravity solutions that are parameterized by arbitrary continuous functions of ( at least ) two variables and have the same charges as the supersymmetric d1-d5-p black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we work in type iib string theory on @xmath0 or @xmath1 and our solutions involve a subset of fields that can be described by a six - dimensional supergravity with two tensor multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions can thus be constructed using a linear structure , and we give an explicit recipe to start from a superposition of modes specified by an arbitrary function of two variables and impose regularity to obtain the full horizonless solutions in closed form . </S>",
    "<S> we also give the precise cft description of these solutions and show that they are not dual to descendants of chiral primaries . </S>",
    "<S> they are thus much more general than all the known solutions whose cft dual is precisely understood . </S>",
    "<S> hence our construction represents a substantial step toward the ultimate goal of constructing the fully generic superstratum that can account for a finite fraction of the entropy of the three - charge black hole in the regime of parameters where the classical black hole solution exists .    </S>",
