    "ybbipt is a heavy - fermion compound which manifests an extraordinary sommerfeld coefficient of @xmath11  j / mol - k@xmath12 and spin - density - wave type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order below a nel temperature of @xmath1  k @xcite .",
    "the low value of @xmath13 reflects the fact that the dominant magnetic energy scales are all small and comparable  the kondo temperature @xmath2  k @xcite , the weiss temperature @xmath14  k @xcite , and the crystalline - electric - field ( cef ) splitting is on the order of @xmath15  k @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the compound s electronic states are very responsive to small applied magnetic fields and pressures@xcite , and recent neutron diffraction measurements have shown that the afm order is quite fragile @xcite .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram indicates that , as @xmath16  k , afm order persists up to a critical applied magnetic field of @xmath17  t , followed by a region of non - fermi liquid behavior up to @xmath18  t , above which fermi - liquid behavior occurs up to at least @xmath19  t @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that a magnetic - field - induced quantum - critical point occurs at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "ybbipt crystallizes in the face - centered - cubic half - heusler structure ( space group @xmath21 ) with a room temperature lattice parameter of @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the yb ions are located at the @xmath23 wyckoff position , forming a face - centered - cubic magnetic sublattice , and the bi and pt are located at the @xmath24 and @xmath25 wyckoff positions , respectively @xcite .",
    "all three sites possess @xmath26 tetrahedral ( i.e.cubic ) point - group symmetry .",
    "neutron scattering experiments have shown that the ambient field magnetic order is characterized by an afm propagation vector of @xmath27 with the magnetic moments directed parallel to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the scattering at the magnetic bragg positions was found to consist of two coincident peaks : a broad peak corresponding to a magnetic correlation length of @xmath29    and a narrower peak corresponding to afm correlations extending over @xmath30   .",
    "the broad peak appears upon cooling through @xmath0  k , while the narrower peak appears below @xmath13 .",
    "the total integrated intensity under both peaks corresponds to a magnetic moment of @xmath31 .",
    "however , the ratio of the integrated intensity of the broad peak to that of the narrower peak is @xmath32 , and previous experiments have estimated that the static ordered moment is @xmath33 to @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "many questions regarding the nature of the low - temperature magnetism and the proposed quantum - critical point remain to be answered .",
    "for example , several previous studies have suggested that a lattice distortion occurs at @xmath35  k which results in a lowering of the cubic symmetry @xcite .",
    "specifically , inelastic neutron scattering data suggest that the @xmath36 ground - state magnetic multiplet of the yb is split by the cef further than allowed for by cubic point symmetry @xcite , and specific heat data show a feature at @xmath19  k that can not be described only by a simple schottky - term @xcite . in addition",
    ", electron spin resonance experiments on er - doped ybbipt suggest that slight distortions away from cubic symmetry occur in the vicinity of the rare - earth sites @xcite , and measurements of the thermal expansion have shown that the thermal expansion coefficient changes sign close to @xmath19  k @xcite .        in this paper , we present results from high - resolution , high - energy x - ray diffraction experiments on single - crystal samples of ybbipt .",
    "our data show that , within the experimental resolution , no bulk distortion of the lattice or the formation of a superstructure occur down to @xmath5  k. in combination with data from dilatometry measurements , we further show that a minimum in the thermal expansion occurs at @xmath7  k , followed by a region of negative thermal expansion for @xmath8  k , and that both features may be modeled using either the cef level scheme appropriate for cubic symmetry or a cef level scheme appropriate for lower than cubic point symmetry .",
    "we suggest that further measurements are necessary , in particular , inelastic neutron scattering experiments on single - crystal samples , in order to elucidate the cef level scheme , and we discuss the importance of understanding the cef level scheme in relation to the compound s complex low - temperature magnetism .",
    "high - quality single crystals of ybbipt were grown using a bi flux , as described previously @xcite .",
    "a sample approximately @xmath37  mm thick with smooth surfaces was chosen for the measurements , and excess flux was carefully removed from the surfaces prior to the experiments .",
    "high - energy x - ray diffraction measurements were made at station @xmath19-id - d at the advanced photon source using an x - ray wavelength of @xmath38    and a beam size of @xmath39 .",
    "the sample was cooled down to @xmath5  k using a he closed - cycle cryostat with a joule - thompson stage .",
    "two be domes were placed over the sample and evacuated , and a small amount of he gas was subsequently added to the inner dome to facilitate thermal equilibrium .",
    "a cylindrical aluminized - kapton heat shield also surrounded the sample and inner be dome . using mucal @xcite to determine the absorption coefficients of ybbipt s constituents for @xmath38   , and using the thickness of the sample and the beam size given above",
    ", we calculated that the transmission of the sample was @xmath40% .",
    "we therefore did not expect any significant heating of the sample by the x - ray beam .",
    "we also did not observe any rise in temperature upon exposing the sample to the beam at @xmath5  k , and believe that the sample was in thermal equilibrium during the measurements .",
    "the cryostat was mounted to the sample stage of a @xmath19-circle diffractometer , and a mar@xmath41 image plate and pixirad-@xmath42 area detector were used to measure the diffracted x - rays transmitted through the sample .",
    "the mar@xmath41 image plate was positioned with its center aligned to the beamstop and was set back @xmath43  m from the sample ( as determined from measurement of a si standard from the national institute of standards and technology ) to record a diffraction pattern spanning a scattering angle of @xmath44 .",
    "the detector was operated with a pixel size of @xmath45 , which resulted in an angular resolution of @xmath46 .",
    "the value for the resolution corresponds to changes in lattice plane spacings ( @xmath47-spacings ) of @xmath48  for @xmath49 and @xmath50  for @xmath51 .",
    "data were taken by recording an image while tilting the sample along two rocking angles .",
    "the pixirad detector is comprised of a hexagonal array of pixels with a spacing of @xmath52 m .",
    "the detector was oriented such that it covered a @xmath53  range in @xmath54 across its horizontal axis , and its center was initially aligned to the direct beam .",
    "hence , the horizontal axis of the detector was lying approximately along the direction of the scattering vector * q*. diffraction data for various bragg peaks were recorded by rocking the sample around its vertical axis in step sizes ranging from @xmath55 .",
    "a frame was recorded for each rocking step and divided by the corresponding number of monitor counts .",
    "the frames were added together to produce a @xmath56-d image of a bragg peak .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows diffraction patterns recorded at @xmath57  k using the mar345 image plate for the incident beam along the three characteristic directions of cubic symmetry . for space group @xmath21",
    ", there are no special reflection conditions for the sites occupied by yb , bi , and pt .",
    "therefore , the space - group symmetry does not exclude each element from contributing to each bragg peak , and the general reflection conditions are such that all @xmath58 must be either even or odd .",
    "the rings in the patterns are due to the be domes attached to the displex and residual bi flux on the sample . using the integrated intensities and structure factors for the the bi @xmath59 and the ybbipt @xmath60 bragg peaks , we estimate that the residual bi accounts for less than @xmath61 of the volume of the sample illuminated by the beam .",

    "there is also no observable broadening or splitting of the diffraction peaks that would suggest a distortion away from cubic symmetry .",
    "finally , no additional bragg peaks were observed , which rules out the formation of a superstructure or breaking of the face - centered - cubic symmetry .",
    "the dynamic range of our measurements was @xmath66:1 and was limited by the thickness and absorption of the sample .",

    "since the size of the incident x - ray beam was comparable to the spacing between pixels and the thickness of the illuminated region of the sample was @xmath85  mm , the shapes of the bragg peaks are primarily governed by the sample s absorption and slight variations in the thickness of the sample as it is rotated .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that the diffraction patterns taken with the mar345 image plate showed single peaks at each expected bragg position at @xmath9  k. we fit the peaks in the * * q**@xmath72 cuts to a gaussian line shape , which only approximates the shape of the peak , but is sufficient for determining the center and estimating the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",

    "in addition to the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , data were taken using different amounts of attenuation , and include patterns with over - illuminated bragg peaks . no peaks indicative of a superstructure or of lowering of the face - centered - cubic symmetry",
    "were found in such over - illuminated patterns either .",
    "data taken with the pixirad detector also show no evidence for a temperature at which splitting or anomalous broadening of the bragg peaks occurs .",
    "nevertheless , we have made two thorough analyses of the possible structures consistent with the observed low - temperature diffraction patterns , paying particular attention to the point - symmetry of the yb site at low temperature .",
    "first , an examination of the wyckoff positions for all of the face - centered - cubic space groups listed in ref .",
    "shows that the minimum multiplicity of the positions for such groups is either @xmath97 or @xmath19 . for those face - centered - cubic groups containing positions with a multiplicity of @xmath97 , which is the number of yb ions in a unit cell ,",
    "the positions all possess cubic point symmetry .",
    "hence , based on the diffraction patterns , which indicate that the lattice is face - centered cubic at @xmath57  k , the yb ions are located at positions with cubic point symmetry .",
    "next , since the signature of a structural phase transition in experimental data for thermodynamic quantities may be weak , we also consider the consequences of a second - order structural phase transition occurring at some temperature between @xmath104 and @xmath37  k. this analysis is performed in accordance with landau s theory for a second - order phase transition ; in particular , if a second - order structural phase transition occurs , then the structures on either sides of the transition should be related through a group - subgroup relation @xcite .",
    "the pertinent subgroups for @xmath21 are the cubic groups @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , the tetragonal group @xmath107 , and the trigonal group @xmath108 . since the symmetry of the diffraction patterns in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] corresponds to cubic symmetry , we rule out that the lattice is described best by a tetragonal or trigonal space group at @xmath9  k. the peaks in the diffraction pattern fit the reflection conditions for a face - centered cell , namely , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 or @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 all even or all odd .",
    "this rules out the @xmath106 subgroup .",
    "the remaining subgroup , @xmath105 , may not be ruled out .",
    "however , following the argument given above , the @xmath97 yb ions would still reside on a site with cubic point symmetry , since @xmath105 is a face - centered - cubic space group .",
    "finally , the isomorphic subgroups @xmath21 possessing enlarged unit cells can be ruled out due to the lack of additional bragg peaks that would correspond to such enlarged unit cells .    summarizing ,",
    "our analyses of the diffraction patterns show that ybbipt has a face - centered - cubic lattice down to at least @xmath5  k , and that the yb are located at a site with cubic point symmetry .",
    "however , since our diffraction data are sensitive to the average , or global , symmetry of the compound , they may average over localized , uncorrelated lattice distortions that could potentially lower the cubic point symmetry of the yb site . in the next section ,",
    "we describe how the point - symmetry of the yb site relates to the energy levels formed by the cef , and how the cef level scheme affects the thermal expansion .",
    "the degeneracy of the ground - state magnetic multiplet of the yb ions should be at least partially lifted by the cef formed by their neighbors .",
    "for ybbipt , the yb site nominally possesses cubic point symmetry , and analysis of high - temperature magnetization data shows that the effective moment per yb is @xmath115 @xcite , which is close to the value of @xmath116 expected for yb@xmath10 ( @xmath36 ) . using these facts",
    ", the point - charge model predicts that the cubic cef should split the @xmath36 magnetic multiplet of the yb@xmath10 into @xmath117 and @xmath118 doublets and a @xmath119 quartet @xcite .",
    "next , specific heat data show that an entropy of @xmath120 is recovered by , which indicates that the cef ground state is likely a doublet @xcite , and data from specific heat and electron spin resonance experiments point to the first and second excited levels occurring at @xmath121 to @xmath122  mev and @xmath123  mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "finally , from magnetic susceptibility data , the ground state was determined to likely be a @xmath118 doublet @xcite , and , from inelastic neutron scattering data , the first excited level was predicted to be a @xmath119 quartet @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , inelastic neutron scattering experiments found a scattering peak at @xmath124  mev , which was identified as a cef level transition to an excited doublet , and two inelastic peaks centered at @xmath125  and @xmath56  mev , which become resolved at @xmath126  k and lie on top of two broad quasielastic signals @xcite .",
    "experiments have not yet detected any dispersion associated with the peaks at @xmath125  and @xmath56  mev , which suggests that they may correspond to cef level transitions .",
    "as for the broad quasielastic signals , they are also seen above @xmath127  k , and it has been proposed that they arise from transitions occurring within the @xmath118 doublet and @xmath119 quartet @xcite .",
    "broad quasielastic scattering in other heavy - fermion compounds has been associated with the hybridization between the localized @xmath128 electrons and itinerant charges and has been related to the value of @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "if the two inelastic peaks at @xmath130 and @xmath56  mev correspond to cef level transitions , then the point symmetry of the yb@xmath10 sites would be lower than cubic , since for the cubic cef level scheme only the @xmath131 and @xmath132 transitions have nonzero transition probabilities @xcite .",
    "based on the inelastic neutron scattering data , two scenarios for the cef level scheme were proposed @xcite : ( 1 ) a @xmath118 ground - state doublet lying close to an excited - state @xmath119 quartet , followed by a @xmath117 doublet located @xmath133  mev above the nearly degenerate @xmath118 and @xmath119 levels ; or ( @xmath56 ) a ground - state doublet followed by @xmath134 excited doublets located at @xmath125 , @xmath56 , and @xmath19  mev .",
    "the latter scenario corresponds to the case of the yb site possessing lower than cubic point symmetry",
    ".    the effect of the cef level scheme on the thermal expansion may be modeled , and , here , we follow the derivations given in refs .   and .",
    "first , the partition function for an ion with cef levels at energies @xmath135 is : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath138 labels each cef energy level , and @xmath139 is the degeneracy of each level . the free energy density for @xmath140 non - interacting ions in a volume @xmath141 is @xmath142 , and may be used to solve for the volume thermal expansion , which is given by : @xmath143 here , @xmath144 is the applied pressure and @xmath145 is the isothermal compressibility . for a cubic crystal , @xmath146 .",

    "the values for @xmath147 differ , which , contrary to the usual invocation of the grneisen parameter of @xmath167 , suggests that the specific heat @xmath168 and @xmath169 are not proportional to each other over the whole temperature range of the experiment .",
    "on the other hand , the large error in @xmath147 for the @xmath119 level of the cubic cef level scheme and for the second excited doublet of the 4-doublet level scheme illustrates the shortcomings of our fits .",
    "specifically , @xmath147 and the energy of the cef levels are correlated , and either fitting both simultaneously or having only weak features in the linear thermal expansion leads to large uncertainty in the fitted values .",
    "ideally , the energy of each cef level should first be accurately determined through other methods ( e.g. through specific heat , electron spin resonance , or inelastic neutron scattering measurements ) . however , as mentioned above , the multiple competing low - energy interactions in ybbipt have made determining the cef level scheme problematic .    while the fits to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] can not distinguish between the presence of a cubic or non - cubic cef , it is apparent from our diffraction data that no splitting of the bragg peaks occurs and that no peaks corresponding to a superstructure form upon cooling .",
    "as noted above , this means that the global symmetry of the compound remains face - centered - cubic down to @xmath5  k , at least within our experimental resolution .",
    "nevertheless , our diffraction data do not rule out the possibility of localized distortions of the crystal lattice that would lower the cubic point symmetry of the yb sites .",
    "in fact , @xmath170yb mssbauer spectroscopy measurements on ybbipd and ybsbpb , which both have cubic lattices similar to that for ybbipt , have shown that the local point symmetry of the yb site is lowered away from cubic symmetry @xcite , and results from similar measurements on a polycrystalline sample of ybbipt have been interpreted as indicating that only @xmath171% of the yb ions are located at a site with cubic point symmetry @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that new measurements , in particular inelastic neutron scattering measurements , on single - crystal samples are necessary to solve the cef level - scheme for the following reasons : ( @xmath42 ) the peaks in the previously reported inelastic neutron scattering data located at @xmath130 and @xmath56  mev apparently showed no dispersion @xcite , however , the measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples , which means that any weak dispersion may not have been discernible .",

    "in addition , further measurements employing probes more sensitive to local distortions of the lattice , such as x - ray spectroscopy ( in particular extended x - ray absorption fine structure ) , atomic - pair - distribution - function analysis , and mssbauer spectroscopy , should be made on single - crystal samples .",
    "using high - energy x - ray diffraction , we have shown that the global symmetry of ybbipt s lattice remains face - centered cubic between @xmath172  k , within the resolution of our experiments of @xmath4   , and that we find no evidence for the formation of a superstructure . by considering the possible space groups consistent with our diffraction patterns taken at @xmath9  k",

    "we suggest that new inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single - crystal samples are necessary to fully solve the cef level scheme , and that further measurements sensitive to localized distortions of the crystal lattice are necessary .",
    "finally , we note that while inelastic neutron scattering is particularly sensitive to magnetic dipole transitions , interactions involving higher - order multipole terms may be important to the low - temperature magnetism and the heavy - fermion type behavior of ybbipt @xcite .",
    "while we do not address the issue of higher - order multipole ordering or transitions here , our results that the global symmetry of the lattice and that the site - symmetry of the yb site remains cubic down to @xmath37  k may offer some constraints for models considered in future works . in light of the multiple competing low - energy interactions present in ybbipt , which are reflected in the broad features in the specific heat and the broad quasielastic scattering , as well as the significant afm correlations evident below 0.7  k , determining the cef level scheme appears to be vital to understanding the compound s complex magnetism .",

    "<S> ybbipt is a heavy - fermion compound possessing significant short - range antiferromagnetic correlations below a temperature of @xmath0  k , fragile antiferromagnetic order below @xmath1  k , a kondo temperature of @xmath2  k , and crystalline - electric - field splitting on the order of @xmath3  k. whereas the compound has a face - centered - cubic lattice at ambient temperature , certain experimental data , particularly those from studies aimed at determining its crystalline - electric - field scheme , suggest that the lattice distorts at lower temperature . here , we present results from high - resolution , high - energy x - ray diffraction experiments which show that , within our experimental resolution of @xmath4   , no structural phase transition occurs between @xmath5 and @xmath6  k. in combination with results from dilatometry measurements , we further show that the compound s thermal expansion has a minimum at @xmath7  k and a region of negative thermal expansion for @xmath8  k. despite diffraction patterns taken at @xmath9  k which indicate that the lattice is face - centered cubic and that the yb resides on a crystallographic site with cubic point symmetry , we demonstrate that the linear thermal expansion may be modeled using crystalline - electric - field level schemes appropriate for yb@xmath10 residing on a site with either cubic or less than cubic point symmetry . </S>"
