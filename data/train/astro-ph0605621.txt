    "a first evidence of dark energy ( de ) came from the hubble diagram of snia , showing an accelerated cosmic expansion , but a _ flat _ cosmology with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is now required by cmb and lss observations and this implies that the gap between @xmath6 and unity is to be filled by a smooth non  particle component , whose nature is one of the main puzzles of cosmology .",

    "if de is a false vacuum , its pressure / density ratio @xmath9 is strictly -1 .",

    "much work has been done on dde ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , also aiming at restricting the range of acceptable @xmath18 s , so gaining an observational insight onto the physics responsible for the potential @xmath11 .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "the dark cosmic components are one of the most compelling evidences of physics beyond the standard model of elementary interactions and , while lab experiments safely exclude non  gravitational baryon  de interactions , dm  de interactions are constrained just by cosmological observations . in turn",
    ", dm  de interactions could ease the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite , i.e. that dm and de densities , differing by orders of magnitude since ever , approach one another at today s eve .    in a number of papers , constraints on coupling , coming from cmb and lss observations , were discussed @xcite .",
    "this note aims at formulating predictions on the mass function of bound systems in coupled de ( cde ) cosmologies , by using sheth & tormen @xcite expressions , known to improve the original press & schechter @xcite approach .",
    "our final scope amounts to finding stronger constraints on dm  de coupling , arising from a comparison of observational data with our predictions , opening a basic window on the nature and origin of these very components .",
    "our analysis will be restricted to sugra @xcite and rp ( ratra  peebles ) @xcite potentials @xmath19 @xmath20 ( @xmath21 : planck mass ) , admitting tracker solutions .",
    "this will however enable us to focus on precise peculiarities , not caused by the shape of @xmath11 but by the coupling itself .",
    "let us also remind that , once the de density parameter @xmath22 is assigned , either @xmath23 or the energy scale @xmath2 , in the potentials ( [ ptntl ] ) , can still be freely chosen . in this paper",
    "we show results for @xmath24gev ; minor quantitative shifts occur when varying @xmath25 in the 14 range .",
    "the rp potential will be mostly considered to test the effects of varying de nature .",
    "the effects of coupling can be seen in the background equations for de and dm , reading @xmath26 here @xmath27 sets the coupling strength and , all through this paper , we take it constant ( and , in particular , independent of @xmath10 ; a different case , which can be physically significant and may deserve a separate treatment @xcite ) with values @xmath28 or 0.20@xmath29 . in previous work this was considered a _ small _ strength .",
    "cmb data set a limit @xmath30 ; a stronger constraint found by @xcite , by studying cluster profiles in n  body simulations , applies to rp potentials only .    on the contrary , even for the smaller coupling we considered , we find significant deviations from uncoupled models in",
    "non  linear observables .",
    "such deviations exhibit intriguing features , suggesting possible ways out from a number of astrophysical problems , while the small coupling strength scarcely affects linear observables .",
    "as far as the other model parameters are concerned , we take density parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this choice approaches the best fit of a @xmath2cdm model to available data .",
    "a best fit to cde models will certainly yield slightly different parameters , but this implies just minor shifts in our quantitative findings .",
    "the essential novel feature induced by dm  de coupling in non  linear structures is baryon  dm segregation .",
    "this was shown in @xcite ( paper i , hereafter ) .",
    "the reason why segregation occurs can be easily illustrated by considering , aside of the eq .",
    "( [ backg ] ) , ruling background dynamics , the couple of equations telling us how the baryon ( dm ) density fluctuations @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and velocity fields @xmath37 depend on @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ; * k * : wavenumber of the fluctuation considered ) .",
    "they read @xmath40 @xmath41 here @xmath42 yields differentiation with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 both eqs .",
    "( [ backg ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ delta2])([ar2 ] ) show that , as soon as @xmath45 , baryons and dm have different dynamics . neglecting radiation and",
    "any hydrodynamical effects , baryons move along geodesics . on the contrary ,",
    "dm particles feel also non  gravitational forces and , as it happens in the presence of any non  gravitational interaction , do not follow geodesics .",
    "this is why baryon  dm segregation occurs .    starting from eqs .",
    "( [ delta2])([ar2 ] ) , the evolution of linear fluctuations in cde cosmologies was studied by @xcite . here",
    "we shall put ourselves into a different physical context , by lifting the restriction @xmath46 , but considering just cases when a full relativistic treatment is unessential . then , dealing with scales well below horizon and with non  relativistic particles , the long  range force carried by the de field @xmath10 can be described through corrections to _ newtonian _ gravity .",
    "they amount to assuming :    \\(i ) dm particle masses to vary , so that @xmath47 .",
    "\\label{masva}\\ ] ]    \\(ii ) the gravitational constant between dm particles to become @xmath48 .",
    "here @xmath49 a proof is given in appendix a , following @xcite and @xcite .    a newtonian treatment is suitable to study the growth of spherical _ top  hat _ fluctuations in the dm and baryon components and to show how their segregation occurs in the relevant physical cases .",
    "in fact , non  linearity starts well after matter  radiation decoupling and the top scales to be considered , galaxy cluster scales , lay well below the horizon .    the evolution of fluctuations in this regime was debated in paper i. here we shall use its results to understand the shaping of mass functions .",
    "we therefore start from reviewing them and complementing them with new quantitative outputs .",
    "although in all cosmologies , apart scdm , the system of equations ruling the spherical growth requires a numerical solution , in cde models the numerical approach is far more essential .",
    "in fact , in all cases apart cde , the only variable describing a _ top  hat _ fluctuation is its radius @xmath50 .",
    "it is assumed to expand , initially , at the same rate of the scale factor @xmath51 , obeying an equation similar to the scale factor in a closed model .",
    "the greater density inside the top hat slows then down the increase rates of @xmath50 in respect to @xmath51 , so that the inner density @xmath52 , although decreasing , becomes greater and greater than the average density @xmath53 .",
    "eventually , at a time @xmath54 , when the density contrast @xmath55 attains a suitable value @xmath56 , @xmath50 stops and starts decreasing .",
    "the equation it obeys would then cause @xmath50 to vanish within a finite time @xmath57 . in scdm cosmologies ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 . in",
    "other non  cde cosmologies , @xmath56 and the ratio @xmath60 take just slightly different values .",
    "after @xmath54 , however , the very density inside @xmath50 is increasing , so that , in any realistic fluctuation , unless radiation disposes the heat produced by the @xmath61 work , virial equilibrium is attained and the collapse essentially stops when the fluctuation radius is @xmath62 . in a scdm cosmology",
    "this occurs for @xmath63 .",
    "taking onto account the symultaneous growth of @xmath51 , the virial density contrast is then @xmath64 . in other cosmologies",
    "the @xmath65 ratio is slightly different from 1/2 and @xmath66 is mostly above 100 , but , in most cases , significantly below 180 .",
    "a usual assumption is that the time when the system is stabilized into a virialized configuration coincides with @xmath57 .",
    "let us also remind that while , in scdm , @xmath66 is independent from @xmath57 , this is no longer true in all models where the density ratio between de and material components depends on time .",
    "quantitative results for the spherically symmetric growth in @xmath2cdm models were given by @xcite ; their extension to models with uncoupled dde is due to @xcite . in these cosmologies ,",
    "the simple system of equations yielding spherical evolution requires a numerical solution .",
    "let us now consider the same problem in the cde case .",
    "this problem had been considered in @xcite , but its approximated treatment did not allow the authors to focus the main physical effects . following @xcite ,",
    "let us outline , first of all , that linear fluctuations in baryons and dm are already different @xcite and have a ratio @xmath67 here @xmath68 is given in eq .",
    "( [ ics ] ) , @xmath69 is given in eq .",
    "( [ cgamma ] ) ; @xmath70 . when considering a spherical top  hat fluctuation , whose initial radius @xmath71 , eq .",
    "( [ biasl ] ) sets the initial ratio between dm and baryon fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "initial conditions are set so that both @xmath72 and @xmath73 initially grow as the scale factor .",
    "however , because of the different interaction strength , as soon as non  linear effects become significant , @xmath74 starts exceeding @xmath75 .",
    "hence , a part of the baryons initially within @xmath76 leak out from @xmath73 , so that dm does not feel the gravity of all baryons , while baryons above @xmath73 feel the gravity also of initially unperturbed dm layers . as a consequence , above @xmath73 , the baryon component deviates from a _ top  hat _ geometry ,",
    "while a secondary perturbation in dm arises also above @xmath73 itself .    after reaching maximum expansion , contraction will also start at different times for different components and layers .",
    "then , inner layers will approach virialization before outer layers , whose later fall  out shall however perturb their virial equilibrium .",
    "this already outlines that the onset of virial equilibrium is a complex process .",
    "furthermore , when the external baryon layers fall  out onto the virialized core , richer of dm , they are accompanied by dm materials originally outside the top ",
    "hat , perturbed by baryon over  expansion .",
    "the time when the greatest amount of materials , originally belonging to the fluctuation , are in virial equilibrium occurs when the dm top  hat has virialized , together with the baryon fraction still below @xmath73 . a large deal of baryonic materials",
    "are then still falling out .",
    "but , when they will accrete onto the dm  richer core , they will not be alone , carrying with them originally alien materials . there will be no discontinuity in the fall  out process when all original baryons are back .",
    "the infall of outer materials just attains then a steady rate .    in order to follow the dynamical evolution of a systems where each layer feels a different and substance  dependent force , a set of concentric shells , granting a sufficient radial resolution ,",
    "needs to be considered . in the next section we shall provide the equations of motion for lagrangian shell radii and review the whole expansion and recontraction dynamics",
    "dynamical equations can be written by using comoving radii @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) for the @xmath79th baryon ( dm ) shell .",
    "let @xmath80 be the masses of the @xmath79th layer , @xmath81 be the masses in the same layer in the absence of perturbations , and @xmath82 be the mass excesses for the @xmath79th layer .",

    "a systematic discrepancy will arise between @xmath88 and @xmath89 and will require taking into account only the fraction of the _ last _ shell below the radius considered . in paper",

    "( [ backg ] ) and the friedman equation .    until @xmath91 , it is @xmath92 , for any @xmath93 .",
    "hence , the gravitational push felt by dm layers is stronger .",

    ", we expect an evolution _ faster _ than @xmath2cdm for any coupling @xmath205 , again the opposite of what we expect in uncoupled dde .",
