    "physics beyond the standard model typically predicts the existence of hidden sectors containing extra matter with new gauge interactions .",

    "decoherence effects can also have interesting effects on the propagation of photons in the presence of photon absorption .",

    "we will discuss in the following possible signals of decoherence in the spectra of tev gamma ray sources .",
    "figure  [ fig : survival ] shows the survival probability for three different values of @xmath23 .",

    "increases _ the photon survival probability .    for the general case of @xmath17 u@xmath1s and strong decoherence @xmath98 we can express the photon survival probability at a distance much larger than the decoherence scale @xmath99 as ( see app .  [",
