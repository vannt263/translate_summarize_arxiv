    "these bcj relations have been proven through a variety of approaches : string theory @xcite , on - shell bcfw recursion @xcite , the cachazo - he - yuan representation @xcite , and most recently by using the invariance of the @xmath0-gluon amplitude under a momentum - dependent shift of the color factors appearing in the cubic decomposition @xcite .",

    "consequently , the bcj relations among the primitive amplitudes follow immediately from the invariance under color - factor shifts of the melia - johansson - ochirov proper decomposition of the amplitude .    johansson and ochirov found that the bcj relations satisfied by the melia primitives are directly tied to the presence of external gluons in the amplitude .",
    "each set of fundamental relations corresponds to one of the external gluons , and when the amplitude contains no external gluons , no relations exist among the primitive amplitudes .",

    "the number of independent bcj relations is precisely equal to the dimension of the color - factor group , and the absence of color - factor symmetry for amplitudes with no gluons explains the absence of relations among the primitive amplitudes .",
