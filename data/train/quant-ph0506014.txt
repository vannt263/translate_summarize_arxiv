    "a lot of developments and applications of the classical approaches of gelfand , levitan @xcite and marchenko @xcite for the solution of the inverse - scattering problem at fixed angular momentum exist , and we have several of excellent reviews on the subject @xcite .",
    "the direct application of these approaches to construction of local two - body potentials which are phase equivalent to the effective potentials occurring in theories describing reactions of composite particles is impossible . for , such potential must be complex in order to reproduce the loss of flux above the inelastic threshold .",
    "but it must reproduce the real phase shifts below this threshold and must be real itself .",
    "these requirements are incompatible for potentials being energy independent by construction .",
    "for very low threshold these approaches are applicable and produce energy independent complex potentials @xcite . in the general case",
    "the empirical energy dependent optical potentials are usually inferred by fitting of the parameters of an assumed analytic potential @xcite .",
    "this approach has two major shortcomings : a complexity and inconvenience of fitting simultaneously many nonlinear parameters ; and lack of correlation of the parameters obtained at various energies .    in this paper",
    "we develop an inversion method that is free of these shortcomings .",
    "the method is based on a fixed-@xmath12 inverse scattering theory and on a special parameterization of the optical potential .",
    "the proposed procedure is a two - step process . in the first step",
    "the phase shift data are used to determine a real potential via solution of the marchenko equation . at this point",
    "we use a diagonal pad approximant @xmath13 $ ] of the corresponding unitary @xmath0-matrix . in the second step the imaginary part of the potential",
    "is determined via the phase equation of the variable phase approach @xcite .",
    "we assume that the real and the imaginary parts of the optical potential are proportional .",
    "the value of the proportionality coefficient is predicted by the phase equation and is refined by the iterative algorithm .",
    "we develop this method for single and for coupled partial waves .",
    "the whole procedure is applied to analyze @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xmath2 data and to analyze @xmath4 @xmath14 and @xmath6 @xmath15 data .",
    "these analyses demonstrate that prediction for the proportionality coefficient from the phase equation is very close to a precise value that reproduce the experimental loss of flux .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we describe the inverse scattering techniques based on the marchenko integral equation . the used diagonal pad approximants of the corresponding @xmath0-matrix allow an analytical solution of the marchenko integral equation @xcite . for single partial wave",
    "the general solution was presented in @xcite .",
    "we present a solution for coupled partial waves .",
    "these techniques produce real local potentials from phase shift analysis data . in sect .",
    "3 we consider the phase equation .",
    "we investigate how the @xmath0-matrix is changing with certain change of the potential .",
    "this consideration shows advantages of proportionality of the real and imaginary parts of the optical potential . in sect .",
    "4 the feasibility of the method is shown in the examples of analyses of @xmath2 , @xmath16 and @xmath7 scattering data .",
    "the marchenko inverse scattering theory is viewed in detail in refs .",
    "we shall , therefore , only briefly describe this formalism .",
    "the input data of the marchenko inversion are @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the scattering matrix dependant on the relative momentum @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the energy of the j - th bound state , so that @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the reduced mass .",
    "the @xmath24 matrices give the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding normalized bound states .",

    "the output kernel @xmath28 gives the reconstructed potential @xmath29    this local energy independent operator @xmath30 links the marchenko equation ( [ mar ] ) and the radial schrdinger equation of a fixed angular momentum , @xmath31\\psi(r , q)=q^2\\psi(r , q ) . \\label{schr}\\ ] ] the scattering matrix @xmath18 , matrices @xmath24 and energies @xmath32 are the output data of the direct scattering problem associated with the schrdinger equation ( [ schr ] ) .    it has been known for several decades now that @xmath0 matrices rational in @xmath19 ( ratio of polynomials ) correspond to potentials known as bargmann potentials expressible in terms of the elementary functions @xcite .",
    "such fraction may have the same truncated taylor series as the @xmath0 matrix it represents .",
    "it is then called a pad approximant .",
    "conjectures and theorems concerning the convergence and analytic continuation properties of pad approximants are collected in @xcite . for single partial wave the general solution of the marchenko equation via pad approximant of the @xmath0-matrix",
    "was presented in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "we shall , therefore , only present it briefly and turn to the case of coupled partial waves .",
    "a diagonal pad approximant of the @xmath0-matrix is given by    @xmath33    @xmath34 and @xmath35 are an odd and even polynomials of @xmath19 , which do not turn to zero at the real axis simultaneously .",
    "this approximant leads to the following expression for the phase shifts @xmath36",
    "@xmath37    inasmuch as @xmath38 for regular potentials , it is evident that degree of @xmath39 must be less than degree of @xmath40 by 1 .",
    "let us select @xmath41 discrete momenta @xmath42 such that the corresponding @xmath43 are known .",
    "use of these values in eq .",
    "( [ eq6a ] ) transforms the latter into a set of inhomogeneous linear equations from which @xmath41 coefficients of the polynomials @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be determined .",
    "this is a usual strategy @xcite , but since any set of @xmath42 is experimentally limited from above ( @xmath44 ) there is some uncertainty in determination of @xmath45 .",
    "even if a set of @xmath42 is dense and the agrement between the data and the used approximant is excellent the arbitrary behavior of @xmath45 above @xmath46 guarantees that a solution of the inverse problem is arbitrary as well .",
    "we assume that about and above @xmath46 the true @xmath47 depends only slightly on details of the potential and does not depend on its asymptotic at @xmath48 .",
    "then we take a model potential ( in our calculations @xmath49 ) and fit parameters ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) so that @xmath52 here signs @xmath53 mean that about @xmath54 the chosen model potential gives a phase curve which goes inside error bars .",
