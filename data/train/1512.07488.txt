    "intermetallic alloys of the 1:2:8 composition , @xmath10 , possess quasi cage structures consisting of polyhedra that cover the rare earth and the transition metal .",
    "these structural peculiarities of cage - like structures are interesting from the perspective of thermoelectric properties@xcite for realizing high thermoelectric power .",
    "for example , a positive maximum of 20  @xmath11v / k was observed for cefe@xmath0al@xmath1 at 150  k. however , limited work on such compounds and the lack of complete understanding of the observed magnetic properties are compelling reasons to investigate new compounds in @xmath10 or to re - investigate some of the reported ones .",
    "the @xmath10 compounds crystallize in orthorhombic space group @xmath12 ( @xmath1355 ) @xcite . in this space group , there are four formula units in the unit cell with one wyckoff position ( @xmath14 ) for the @xmath7 atom , two ( @xmath14 ) for @xmath15 and nine ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath14 and @xmath18 ) for the @xmath19 atom @xcite . the @xmath7 or @xmath15 atom in this structure is surrounded by nine to twelve @xmath19 atoms .",
    "the @xmath7 and the @xmath15 atoms form a _ chain _ parallel to the @xmath2-axis which are separated by the @xmath19 atoms .",
    "it is important to mention here a major question regarding the structural chemistry of 1:2:8 compounds regarding why they do not form 2:1:8 or 1:1:5 stoichiometries which are more stable , especially known for the ce - variants@xcite .",
    "it has been found from previous studies that the reason lies in the ionic size of the @xmath7 and the @xmath19 . in the case of 1:1:5 and 2:1:8-stoichiometries ,",
    "the @xmath7-ion is in the trivalent @xmath20 ( ce ) state whereas in 1:2:8 systems , the rare earth is in divalent or mixed - valent state @xcite . in ce - based 1:2:8 systems , @xcite a transition from magnetic trivalent state of ce to non - magnetic kondo - like state of ce",

    "the figure was created using the software vesta.@xcite ]    strongly correlated electron behaviour was one of the focus themes to investigate the @xmath10 compounds and such signatures have been experimentally observed in ce@xmath21al@xmath1 [ @xmath15 = fe , co]@xcite . it was argued that the ground state of these compounds was governed by rkky interaction@xcite but possessed contrasting outcomes  in one case a metallic fermi liquid state was evidenced whereas in the other , a heavy fermi - liquid with proximity to long - range magnetic order@xcite .",
    "cerium based @xmath10 with @xmath19 = al , ga have been reported previously also @xcite on which mbauer spectroscopy@xcite and neutron diffraction studies@xcite were performed in order to understand the magnetic ground state .",
    "interestingly , no signature of long - range magnetic order was obtained in the case of cefe@xmath0al@xmath1 from neutron powder diffraction data though the magnetic susceptibility displayed a broad transition around 5  k @xcite . though ce - based @xmath22al@xmath1 were investigated in detail in the past ,",
    "only a few reports on pr - based systems exist .",
    "for example , prco@xmath0al@xmath1 displays a phase transition at 5  k and metamagnetic - like steps in magnetic hysteresis@xcite . from the analysis of high temperature magnetic susceptibility and estimates of effective paramagnetic",
    "moment , any contribution from co magnetism was ruled out .",
    "the absence of magnetism of the @xmath15 sub - lattice was a feature observed in the case of cefe@xmath0al@xmath1 also @xcite . in the case of ceco@xmath23al@xmath1 single crystals where doping at the co - site",
    "was performed with @xmath15 = mn , fe and ni , only a slight enhancement of magnetic moment compared to the ce@xmath4-only moment was observed@xcite .",

    "since the values of @xmath32 from inelastic neutron scattering experiments are not available for prfe@xmath0al@xmath1 or closely related systems , tentative initial values were instead obtained from the reports on 1:1:3 systems prgao@xmath36@xcite and prirsi@xmath36@xcite .",

    "it must be noted that an accurate estimation of the cef levels , @xmath32 , is best possible through inelastic neutron scattering methods and usually the schottky contribution to the specific heat is calculated using the @xmath32 thus derived@xcite .",
    "the amorphous ferromagnetic contribution from the fe sub - lattice would have very little contribution towards the total magnetic entropy however the exchange field generated this way may polarize the low - lying crystal field levels .",
    "the magnetic entropy plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_cp ] ( c ) clearly shows full doublet close to @xmath5 whereas the cef analysis shows the first two excited energy levels at approximately 10  k. an almost full occupation of 9 levels is attained at @xmath37 200  k in fig .",
    "[ fig_cp ] ( c ) whereas the cef analysis presents highest level at above 300  k. these qualitative inconsistencies might have their origin in the subtraction procedure performed to obtain the magnetic specific heat , or inaccuracies in the estimation of crystal field levels .",
    "the distinct feature in @xmath38 at @xmath39 however is unequivocal and reproducible regardless of whether @xmath40 or @xmath41 is inspected for the entropy change at @xmath39 .",
    "alternatively , the itinerant electron magnetism inherent to the material also can contribute towards such a feature .",
    "keeping in mind that a faithful estimation of the cef levels are possible through inelastic neutron scattering methods , our future endeavour would be to carry out an accurate estimation of the cef levels .",
    "the magnetic properties exhibited by pr@xmath42 compounds calls for deeper investigations involving microscopic structural probes like neutrons and @xmath11sr .",
    "the structural peculiarities comprising of the quasi cage - like structure of al polyhedra and the strand - like alignment of pr and @xmath15 along the @xmath2-axis are of key significance . among the various @xmath10 compounds investigated , the ce - based compounds cefe@xmath0al@xmath1 and ceco@xmath0al@xmath1 displayed no signature of magnetic ordering down to 0.4  k @xcite .",
    "these compounds were investigated for the strongly correlated electron behaviour . in ceco@xmath0al@xmath1 , a stable ce magnetic moment",
    "was observed while in cefe@xmath0al@xmath1 , intermediate - valent states .",
    "single crystal studies on ceco@xmath43al@xmath1 [ @xmath44 = mn , fe , ni ] concluded that the @xmath45 moment was not perturbed by the size of the dopant atom@xcite .",
    "however , signs of ferromagnetism emerged in the case of doping with mn and fe .",
    "a report on neutron diffraction investigation on cefe@xmath0al@xmath1 did not reveal magnetic ordering down to 1.5  k@xcite however , the magnetization and mbauer data suggested clusters of fe below 6.5  k. on the other hand , prco@xmath0al@xmath1 was found to order magnetically below 5  k@xcite with a metamagnetic - like transition at a critical field of 0.9  t. interestingly , the magnetic susceptibility was reported to adhere to ideal curie - weiss behaviour with an effective magnetic moment of 3.48(5 )  @xmath46/f.u . suggesting the presence of stable pr@xmath4 moment . no contribution to magnetism from co moment was inferred . in table",
    "[ tab3 ] , the magnetic properties of the pr - based @xmath10 compounds are collected .",
    "+ rietveld analysis of the laboratory x ray data indicates that the pr - based 1:2:8 compounds prfe@xmath0al@xmath1 , prfe@xmath0ga@xmath1 and prco@xmath0ga@xmath1 belong to the same orthorhombic @xmath12 space group with similar lattice parameters and comparable interatomic distances for pr  pr , fe  fe distances ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "prco@xmath0ga@xmath1 is found to display no signs of magnetic ordering ( data not presented ) while prfe@xmath0ga@xmath1 shows a magnetic transition at 15  k. given the structural similarities between these compounds , it is interesting to observe multiple magnetic anomalies in prfe@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "both the anomalies do not display any frequency dispersion in ac susceptibility measurements while the anomaly at 4  k is suppressed upon the application of 10  koe magnetic field .",
    "an added proof for the pr ordering at @xmath5 is obtained from the magnetic entropy derived from total specific heat ( fig .",
    "[ fig_cp ] ) where @xmath6 = @xmath7ln(2 ) is recovered at @xmath5 .",
    "however , arrott plots indicate the presence of inhomogeneous magnetism at low temperatures@xcite .",

    "most importantly , the 1/@xmath47 data of prfe@xmath0al@xmath1 presented in fig .  [ fig_cw ] ( a ) supports the role of cef levels of pr@xmath4 as well as the presence of magnetic fluctuations of fe which persist up to 300  k or above . + the specific heat and cef analysis of pr - based cubic systems are of fundamental interest to probe the resulting magnetic ground state .",
    "several prototypical compounds have been investigated in this regard .",
    "a number of pr - based systems show magnetic order despite a nonmagnetic ground state suggested by the cef predictions .",
    "in fact , magnetic order can be established via the admixture of higher lying cef levels into a ground state of higher degeneracy in the case of exchange energy larger than the first cef excitation@xcite .",
    "such cef assisted ferromagnetic ordering is observed in the case of prnige@xmath0@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the exchange interactions between the rare earth ions dominate over the cef , the magnetic moment associated with the @xmath45 electrons can be completely quenched@xcite .",
    "induced magnetism in the singlet ground state system prirsi@xmath36 has been observed with a surprisingly large energy splitting of 92  k @xcite .",
    "another pr - based compound , prau@xmath0si@xmath0 and its doped variant prau@xmath0(si@xmath48ge@xmath49)@xmath0 are systems where dynamic fluctuations of the cef levels were found to hold the key to destabilizing the induced moment magnetism and realizing spin glass state@xcite . in prptbi , for example , pr@xmath4 occupies a cubic local symmetry which splits the ninefold degenerate ground state of @xmath28 in to one singlet ( @xmath50 ) , one doublet ( @xmath51 ) and two triplets ( @xmath52 , @xmath53)@xcite . an energy separation of 87.5  k between the ground state and the first excited state",
    "was estimated .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the intermetallic compound prfe@xmath0al@xmath1 which crystallizes in @xmath12 symmetry with quasi cage - like structure of al atoms .",
    "the structural features of prfe@xmath0al@xmath1 resembles those of other isostructural compounds like lafe@xmath0al@xmath1 and prco@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "magnetic measurements reveal two anomalies at @xmath54 34  k and @xmath3 4  k. the latter anomaly is likely to originate from magnetic ordering in the pr lattice however , a conclusion about this requires further experimental proofs .",
    "signatures of short - range magnetic fluctuations in the fe lattice are also obtained however , could be mediated by impurities .",
    "metamagnetic - like steps in the magnetization isotherm at 2  k is clearly evidenced .",
    "the phase transitions at @xmath3 4  k is also reflected in the specific heat .",
    "analysis of magnetic entropy identifies a value of @xmath7  ln(2 ) at 4  k suggesting the presence of a pr doublet crystal field level in spite of the symmetry of pr site predicting only 9 singlet levels .",
