    "in human genetic variation studies , sequencing methods are applied that read out the genetic information at snp ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) sites for multiple individuals . in order",
    "to be low - priced and feasible , these methods determine , for each site separately , the present bases , of which there can be two since the human dna is arranged in pairs of chromosomes . for each individual in the variation study this yields a _ genotype _ that describes the bases at snp sites . while the genotype says for every site which bases are present , it lacks the information on how the bases are assigned to the chromosomes of a pair .",
    "this information , which is described by _ haplotypes _ , is crucial to describe fine - grained genetic variation .",
    "the objective of _ haplotyping _ is to compensate the drawback of genotype data by predicting biologically reasonable haplotypes computationally .",
    "gusfield  @xcite proposed an approach to haplotyping that seeks haplotypes that are arrangeable in a perfect phylogenetic tree  @xcite .",
    "he showed that this problem , which will be called _ perfect phylogeny haplotyping _",
    "( ) is solvable in polynomial time by a reduction to the graph realization problem . due to the practical importance of haplotyping , several groups also proposed simpler polynomial time  @xcite and linear time algorithms  @xcite for gusfield s approach .",
    "in the present paper we study the space complexity of . in @xcite",
    "we showed that is hard for the complexity class @xmath0 ( deterministic logarithmic space ) and lies in the counting class @xmath1  @xcite ( see this paper for a wider discussion of the haplotyping issue and complexity theoretic terms ) .",
    "the main open problem of  @xcite , namely , whether lies in the class @xmath0 , is answered affirmatively by the present paper . to prove this result",
    ", we present a graph - based characterization that extends ideas from eskin , halperin and karp  @xcite . given a set of genotypes ,",
    "they build , for each genotype separately , graphs where the vertices represent sites and edges represent known relations between them .",
    "based on these graphs , they proved that the existence of a perfect phylogeny is related to the question whether one can extend the known relations , such that all graphs become complete bipartite .",
    "our characterization avoids the step of guessing new relations between pairs of sites : we determine all relevant relations beforehand and directly construct graphs that are bipartite if , and only if , there is a perfect phylogeny .",
    "since the graph construction can be described by first - order formulas and the problem of deciding whether a graph is bipartite lies in @xmath0  @xcite , we are able to prove the following theorem :    [ theorem : completeness ] is complete for deterministic logarithmic space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ section : basics ] we provide a formal definition of the problem and induced sets of pairs of sites . in section  [ section :",
    "characterization ] , we prove our graph based - characterization and , after that , we reduce   to the problem of whether an undirected graph is bipartite in section  [ section : reduction ] .",
    "since only two different bases are present at the majority of snp sites , it is convenient to code haplotypes as strings over the alphabet @xmath2 , where for a given site @xmath3 stands for one of the bases that can be observed in practice , while @xmath4 encodes a second base that can also be observed .",
    "a genotype @xmath5 is a sequence of sets that arises from a pair of haplotypes @xmath6 and @xmath7 as follows : the  @xmath8th set in the sequence @xmath5 is @xmath9,h'[i]\\}$ ] .",
    "however , it is customary to encode the set @xmath10 as @xmath3 , to encode @xmath11 as @xmath4 , and @xmath2 as @xmath12 , so that a genotype is actually a string over the alphabet @xmath13 .",
    "for example , the two haplotypes @xmath14 and @xmath15 underly ( we also say _ explain _ ) the genotype @xmath16 ; and so do @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these haplotype pairs differ in the way how the 2-entries at positions three and four are determined .",
    "the haplotypes have the same entries at positions three and four in the first case and different entries in the second case .",
    "this fact can be generally stated as follows : if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are explaining haplotypes for a genotype @xmath5 with 2-entries in sites  @xmath8 and  @xmath19 ( @xmath20 = g[j ] = 2 $ ] ) , then either @xmath21 = h[j ] \\neq h'[i ] = h'[j]$ ] or @xmath21 = h'[j ] \\neq h'[i ] = h[j]$ ] holds . in the first case",
    "we say that _ @xmath6 and @xmath7 resolve @xmath5 equally in  @xmath8 and  @xmath19 _ and in the second case we say that _ @xmath6 and @xmath7 resolve @xmath5 unequally in  @xmath8 and  @xmath19_. to represent more than one haplotype , we arrange them in _ haplotype matrices _ where each row is a haplotype and each column corresponds to a site . for genotypes ,",
    "we use _ genotype matrices_. an @xmath22 haplotype matrix @xmath23 _ explains _ an @xmath24 genotype matrix @xmath25 if for each  @xmath8 , the haplotypes in rows @xmath26 and @xmath27 of @xmath23 explain the genotype in row  @xmath8 of @xmath25 .",
    "we are interested in haplotypes that are arrangeable in a perfect phylogenetic tree .",
    "we say that a haplotype matrix @xmath23 _ admits a perfect phylogeny _ if there exists a rooted tree @xmath28 , such that :    each row of @xmath23 labels exactly one node of @xmath28 .",
    "each column of @xmath23 labels exactly one edge of @xmath28 and each edge is labeled by at least one column .",
    "for every two rows @xmath6 and @xmath7 of @xmath23 and every column  @xmath8 , we have @xmath21 \\neq h'[i]$ ] if , and only if , @xmath8 lies on the path from @xmath6 to @xmath7 in @xmath28 .",
    "a haplotype matrix @xmath23 _ admits a directed perfect phylogeny _ if @xmath23 together with the all-0-haplotype admits a perfect phylogeny .",
    "the _ four gamete property _ is an alternative characterization for perfect phylogenies , observed by many authors ( see  @xcite for references ) .",
    "it depends on a certain relation between pairs of columns : the _ induced set _",
    "@xmath29 of two columns  @xmath8 and  @xmath19 in a haplotype matrix @xmath23 contains all strings from @xmath30 that appear in the columns  @xmath8 and  @xmath19 .",
    "the four gamete property then says that a haplotype matrix @xmath23 admits a perfect phylogeny if , and only if , for each pair of columns  @xmath8 and  @xmath19 we have @xmath31 . carried over to the directed case we know that @xmath23 admits a directed perfect phylogeny if , and only if , for each pair of columns  @xmath8 and  @xmath19 we have @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ three gamete property _ in the following .",
    "we say that a genotype matrix @xmath25 _ admits a ( directed ) perfect phylogeny _ if there exists an explaining haplotype matrix for it that admits a ( directed ) perfect phylogeny or , equivalently , satisfies the four ( three ) gamete property . the perfect phylogeny haplotyping problem ( @xmath33 ) contains exactly the genotype matrices that admit a perfect phylogeny .",
    "similar , the directed perfect phylogeny haplotyping problem ( @xmath34 ) contains exactly the genotype matrices that admit a directed perfect phylogeny .",
    "the problems and are closely related through first - order reductions : for a reduction from to is suffices to append the all-0-genotype to a given genotype matrix and for the converse direction we can use a reduction from eskin , halperin and karp  @xcite : in every column where a 1-entry appears before a 0-entry , substitute all 1-entries by 0-entries and all 0-entries by 1-entries . for convenience we restrict ourselves to directed perfect phylogenies in the rest if this section and section  [ section : characterization ] .",
    "we come back to undirected perfect phylogenies in section  [ section : reduction ] .",
    "a genotype matrix determines , to a certain extend , the induced sets of explaining haplotype matrices .",
    "this is formalized by the notion of induced sets for genotype matrices in  @xcite : for a genotype matrix @xmath25 and two columns  @xmath8 and  @xmath19 , the set @xmath35 contains a string @xmath36 , whenever @xmath25 has a genotype @xmath5 with either @xmath20 = x$ ] and @xmath37 = y$ ] , @xmath20 = x$ ] and @xmath37 = 2 $ ] or @xmath20 = 2 $ ] and @xmath37 = y$ ] . from this definition",

    "also we know that @xmath25 does not admit a directed perfect phylogeny whenever @xmath40 holds .",
    "if we consider only explaining haplotype matrices that satisfy the three gamete property , we can infer some information about the resolution of 2-entries : let @xmath25 be a genotype matrix and @xmath23 an explaining haplotype matrix for @xmath25 that satisfies the three gamete property .",

    "this can possibly end up with a column pair where one genotype is forced to be resolved equally , while another is already resolved unequally . in this case",
