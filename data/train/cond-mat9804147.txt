    "as is well known , quantum monte carlo simulations are plagued by the so - called sign problem@xcite .",
    "the sign problem refers to the fact that when physical properties are sampled in configurations space , one collects large positive and negative contributions due to the fact that a fermion wavefunction is of different sign in different regions of configuration space .",
    "these contributions of opposite sign tend to cancel , giving results that may be exponentially smaller than the separate positive and negative contributions .",
    "though the sign problem can be circumvented in special cases , e.g. , for the hubbard model at half filling @xcite , no general solution has emerged yet from the various approaches that have been explored to cure it @xcite .    in 1990 , when b. j. alder was lorentz professor in leiden , hans van leeuwen became acquinted with the fixed node monte carlo ( fnmc ) method of ceperley and alder @xcite , which avoids the sign problem in the context of continuum green s function monte carlo .",
    "this stimulated him to explore the possibility of formulating a lattice version of fnmc , first with a postdoc , an@xcite , and later in collaborations with the present authors@xcite .",
    "the formulation of the approach which was developed later@xcite was shown to be variational@xcite , i.e. to give an upper bound to the exact ground state , and is the subject of this paper , which we dedicate to hans van leeuwen .",
    "we test this fnmc method for lattice fermions@xcite on a simple one - dimensional ( 1@xmath0 ) model for which various results are available , the 1@xmath0 kondo lattice model ( klm ) at half filling .",
    "this fnmc method involves an approximation that removes the sign problem in the context of green s function monte carlo .",
    "different monte carlo techniques that have been applied to the 1@xmath0 klm include the world - line algorithm@xcite , a finite temperature grand - canonical method involving a hubbard - stratonovich transformation@xcite and the ground state method developed by sorella _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "all three monte carlo methods suffer from the sign problem , even in 1@xmath0 .",
    "the klm is one of the basic models for correlated fermions .",
    "it can be obtained as the strong - coupling limit of the periodic anderson model , which aims at capturing the essential physics of heavy - fermion materials@xcite . in the limit of strong on - site repulsion among the @xmath3-electrons ,",
    "a picture emerges of localized @xmath3-electrons interacting with a conduction band . in recent years",
    ", the model has been studied by a variety of methods , including variational approximations , exact diagonalizations and the density matrix renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "this , together with the fact that quantum monte carlo simulations of this model do have a sign problem , makes the 1@xmath0 klm a suitable testing ground for our lattice fnmc method .",
    "the lattice version of fnmc gives , like the continuum version@xcite which inspired it , upper bounds for the ground state energy@xcite .",
    "it improves upon a trial wave function for a given hamiltonian by employing a green s function projection method with a modified hamiltonian in which all terms which would lead to unwanted sign changes in the sampling , are treated in a special way .",
    "the sign structure of the resulting approximate wave function , which is the ground state wave function of the modified hamiltonian , is the same as that of the original trial wave",
    ". one obvious immediate question of interest is how close the fnmc energy estimate is to the exact ground state energy of the original hamiltonian .",
    "we will study this question by applying the fixed - node projection to a trial wave function with a free parameter .",
    "as we shall see , for the klm , the ground state energy obtained in the fnmc at half filling is quite independent of the precise trial wave , and quite close to the values obtained in exact diagonalisation .",
    "we also compare the fnmc results for some correlation functions ( which do not obey bounds ) , with exact results@xcite for chains of six sites , with coupling constant @xmath4 equal to @xmath5 and @xmath6 . here",
    "too we find that our best fnmc simulation estimates are rather independent of the starting trial wave function , and reasonably close to the exact values .",
    "we finally also show how the spin gap of the 1@xmath0 klm can be determined with our fnmc , although this is computationally much more demanding , since a trial wave consisting of a sum of slater determinants must be used .",
    "good agreement is found with earlier results@xcite in this case .    before presenting our results , we first briefly discuss the 1@xmath0 klm and the reason why sampling it with unrestricted random walks leads to the sign problem .",
    "then , in section [ fnmc ] , the principles of the lattice fnmc are summarized , followed by details of the implementation for the klm .",
    "section [ results ] gives the comparison with exact results for small lattices . in section [ soliton ] ,",
    "our results for the running spin triplet excitation are discussed .",
    "the kondo lattice hamiltonian is given by @xmath7 the two kinds of electrons , denoted by @xmath8 for the conduction band and @xmath3 for localized levels , have a spin - spin interaction . for the @xmath3 s ,",
    "the constraint is that there has to be precisely one @xmath3-electron on every site . in ( [ klm ] ) and below ,",
    "a summation convection is used for repeated spin indices .",
    "we seek to write the hamiltonian in a form that is convenient for gfmc calculations .",
    "if one would treat the @xmath3 s as spins , which are not antisymmetrized but form a dynamical background for the conduction electrons , the total number of up - spin ( and of down - spin ) _ fermions _ would not be conserved by the hamiltonian .",
    "it is not convenient to use this representation in a gfmc calculation whose starting trial wave is a fully fermionic mean - field type wavefunction .",
    "if we use the constraint of one @xmath3-electron per site and the identities @xmath9 where the components of @xmath10 denote the three pauli matrices , the hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "this is now fully in fermionic language .",
    "therefore , slater determinants of fixed dimension can be used .",
    "= 4.5 cm    in many fermionic lattice models , e.g. the hubbard model , the fermion statistics is not really important in monte carlo simulations in 1@xmath0 .",
    "the reason is that , fermions of the same spin can not pass each other in 1@xmath0 and so their ordering is fixed . since the exchanges that give rise to sign changes as a result of the fermion antisymmetry of the wave function , are suppressed , there is no sign problem . in higher dimensions ,",
    "this is not the case .    for the 1@xmath0 klm",
    ", there is no fixed ordering of conduction electrons of equal spin .",
    "the presence of the spin flip term proportional to @xmath13 in @xmath14 makes it possible for the ordering to change .",
    "this is illustrated in fig",
    "a down @xmath8-electron at site 1 first changes in an up - electron , due to the simultaneous flip of a @xmath8-@xmath3 pair .",
    "then , the @xmath8-electrons at site 1 and 2 have opposite spins , so after a hop due to the kinetic term , they can occupy the same site . after an additional hop of the other @xmath8-electron , the two @xmath8-electrons then effectively have been interchanged",
    ".    such an interchange can also happen in a monte carlo simulation , and one needs to take into account that two configurations that differ by the interchange of two numbered electrons must have opposite signs in the wave function .",
    "this is the reason why even the 1@xmath0 klm exhibits a sign problem@xcite . in the case of 6 sites at half - filling with @xmath15 , which is studied by otsuka  @xcite",
    ", it appears that the sign problem is not very severe , but at certain filling fractions the sign problem is known to make simulations prohibitively difficult@xcite .",
    "the 1@xmath0 klm has been studied in different regimes .",
    "if the number of @xmath3-electrons is equal to the number of sites , and the carrier concentration is low , there is a ferromagnetic state@xcite . in weak coupling , at larger density but below half - filling , one obtains a paramagnetic state@xcite , and at half - filling , the system shows insulating spin - liquid behavior@xcite .",
    "recently , the ground state was proven to bea spin singlet and proven to be unique @xcite . for slightly less than one @xmath3-electron per site ,",
    "impurity bands arise@xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we limit ourselves to the case of half - filling , one @xmath8-electron per site .",
    "finite - size scaling results@xcite as well as recent density matrix renormalization group calculations@xcite both show that there is a gap for spin and charge excitations for all @xmath16 and thus confirm the insulating spin - liquid character of the ground state at half filling .",
    "since the general principles of the fnmc for lattice fermions have been laid out before@xcite , we only summarize the most essential aspects of the method here .    in a green s function monte carlo method ,",
    "one projects out the ground state of a system with hamiltonian @xmath17 from an initial trial state @xmath18 . as before@xcite",
    ", we use a projection operator @xmath19 which acts as follows : @xmath20^{n}|\\psi_{\\text{t}}\\rangle .\\label{projector}\\ ] ] the implementation is in configuration space , and has a stochastic character . a specific configuration in configuration space , which determines the locations , spins , etc . of all the labeled electrons , is denoted by @xmath21 , and we write @xmath22 , etc .",
    "when @xmath23 is small enough and @xmath24 adjusted properly during the sampling process@xcite , the operator @xmath25 projects onto the ground state as @xmath26 . to obtain better statistics ,",
    "we introduce _ importance sampling _",
    ": we let the green s function @xmath27 determine the transition probabilities of a random walker from @xmath28 to @xmath21 ; for simplicity , we take the trial wave function to be real .",
    "the projection ( [ projector ] ) then becomes @xmath29 in the random walk interpretation underlying the monte carlo process , the initial distribution of the random walkers is given by @xmath30 , and ( [ prod ] ) is sampled stochastically by splitting @xmath31 as @xmath32 with @xmath33 and hence @xmath34 .",
    "this notation anticipates that we wish to view @xmath35 as a transition probability , the probability for a particle to make a transition from configuration @xmath36 to @xmath21 , so that a path @xmath37 in configuration space is generated by sampling the transitions according to @xmath35 .",
    "the weight factors @xmath38 which are accumulated along a path are sampled by viewing them as a multiplicity factor of each walker@xcite . after a suitable number of steps ,",
    "these multiplicity factors are sampled by a branching process : at these events , a walker with a multiplicity factor @xmath38 can be either killed , stay alive , or split into more walkers in such a way that , on average , there are @xmath39 new ones after the event .",
    "after each branching event , the factors @xmath38 of all the walkers are reset to 1 .",
    "if all transition probabilities @xmath31 would be positive , the above process could be implemented straightforwardly as in simulations of boson lattice models@xcite . for fermions ,",
    "the sign problem arises in the present formulation through the fact that @xmath40 , and hence @xmath41 , can be negative .",
    "in particular , for the klm ( [ ham ] ) , as for the hubbard model@xcite , all off - diagonal terms @xmath42 of the hamiltonian @xmath43 are negative , and so negative signs arise in making transitions between configurations at which the trial wave function has opposite signs , @xmath44 . taking those transition probabilities",
    "@xmath45 proportional to @xmath46 and carrying the sign with each walker would give positive and negative _ multiplicities _ , eventually , and therefore , the implementation of eq.([prod ] ) would lead to large positive and negative contributions to all measured quantities .",
    "the resulting cancellations are the essence of the sign problem .    in the lattice",
    "fnmc the sign problem is avoided by introducing a slightly different _ effective hamiltonian _",
    "@xmath47 in which all steps that lead to a sign change of the walker are left out , and replaced by a potential term@xcite .",
    "the steps that are left out satisfy @xmath48 this is implemented by defining an effective hamiltonian as follows : the off - diagonal terms are @xmath49 and the diagonal terms are @xmath50 where the ` sign flip ' potential that replaces the hops that satisfy eq.([condition ] ) is given by @xmath51 in this expression , the sum runs over all configurations @xmath36 connected by a non - zero matrix element @xmath52 to the configurations @xmath21 , for which ( [ condition ] ) holds . the ground state energy of @xmath47 , which can be sampled without sign problem , gives@xcite an upper bound to the ground state energy of the true hamiltonian @xmath53 .",
    "expectation values of physical quantities are then obtained in the standard way@xcite .      as we saw above ,",
    "a prerequisite for a green s function monte carlo calculation is a trial wave function . for the klm",
    ", we use what amounts to a gutzwiller - projected mean - field type wavefunction as a trial state .",
    "this wavefunction is essentially obtained as follows .",
    "since earlier work indicates that this gives the lowest energy results , we use the kondo decoupling scheme in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , i.e. , @xmath14 is approximated by @xmath54 + \\frac{4}{j } \\sum_{i}| v_i|^2.\\ ] ] the hamiltonian @xmath55 is bilinear in the fermion operators and hence can be diagonalized .",
    "we denote the ground state of this hamiltonian by @xmath56 .",
    "the trial state @xmath18 we use for our calculations is then @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the gutzwiller projection operator which projects onto states in which each site is occupied by one @xmath3-electron@xcite .",
    "for the homogeneous ground state , all @xmath59 s should be taken equal , @xmath60 . following otsuka@xcite",
    ", we will use this @xmath61 as a variational parameter to construct a family of trial states for our ground state calculations .",
    "the explicit form of the wavefunction can be easily obtained , and is given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) of otsuka@xcite ( his parameter @xmath61 is the same as ours ) .",
    "this wavefunction takes the form of a hybridized band state , but after gutzwiller projection , it can also be written in the form of a overlapping kondo cloud state@xcite .",
    "we will actually find it more convenient to present our ground state results as a function of @xmath62 note that the average is computed _ before _",
    "gutzwiller projection  in the gutzwiller projected state the average is obviously zero . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the self - consistency condition for the homogeneous ground state reads @xmath63 ; this relation can easily be worked out in the thermodynamics limit , but as stated before , we will not use this .",
    "we also use the gutzwiller - projected mean field solution as our trial state for the lowest energy triplet state in section v. the mean - field solution in this case is inhomogeneous@xcite ; hence , in this case the parameters @xmath59 in the selfconsistency conditions @xmath64 do depend on the spatial index @xmath65 .",
    "we refer to the paper by wang _",
    "et al._@xcite for a detailed discussion of the structure of this mean field solution .",
    "the single - particle levels or our trial wave are represented by an index for the energy the level , an index for the site , and an index which indicates whether an electron has @xmath8 or @xmath3 character .",
    "this way of representing the trial wave function is suitable for the order in which the operators in the interaction term appear in eq.([ham ] ) , and for the decoupling we have chosen to generate the trial state .",
    "the operators between parentheses in the spin interaction term in @xmath14 represent intermediate steps in a monte carlo diffusion process .",
    "these correspond to changes within one spin sector .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to have numbered electrons of a certain spin and to allow changes from @xmath8 to @xmath3 and vice versa , rather than to have numbered electrons with the @xmath8 or @xmath3 character fixed and letting the spin change .",
    "both representations are equivalent , but our choice allows to work with slater - matrices of fixed size .    in the monte carlo calculation , the trial wave determines the distribution of random walkers ; each walker represents a configuration , i.e. , specifies the positions of each electron , its spin , and whether it is @xmath8 or @xmath3 .",
    "the weight of a certain configuration in the initial ensemble can be calculated from the trial state , by taking the product of the determinants corresponding to the spin - up and spin - down single - particle states .",
    "the ensemble is chosen by generating configurations at random , and then comparing the weight squared with a random number , in order to decide whether that configuration should be accepted as a member of the ensemble or not . by imposing the constraint of one @xmath3-electron per site , the ensemble is automatically gutzwiller - projected .",
    "once the initial ensemble is gutzwiller projected , the ensemble remains so during the projection process , since all moves allowed by @xmath14 keep the @xmath3-levels singly occupied .      for the klm hamiltonian eq.([ham ] ) , all off - diagonal terms @xmath66 are negative , for an antiferromagnetic spin - interaction @xmath67 .",
    "all steps are therefore according to ( [ condition ] ) subdivided into allowed steps for which @xmath68 and forbidden steps for which @xmath69 ; the latter steps contribute to the sign flip potential@xcite ( [ vsf ] ) .",
    "if we use @xmath14 in the projector ( [ projector ] ) , three things can happen in one time step of the fnmc .",
    "first of all , @xmath70 can go to a configuration with one @xmath8-electron hopped to a neighboring position due to the kinetic term in @xmath43 .",
    "the second possibility is a simultaneous spin flip : the spin interaction term proportional to @xmath4 allows a configuration which has , on a certain site , a pair @xmath8-up , @xmath3-down , to change into @xmath8-down , @xmath3-up ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the third possibility is that nothing happens in a time step : @xmath71 .",
    "the relative probabilities are given by eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) . for a given walker , which corresponds to a given configuration",
    ", a list is therefore made of all possible allowed steps and their probabilies . when a forbidden step is encountered in making this list ,",
    "the corresponding contribution to the sign flip potential ( [ vsf ] ) is calculated . since for every configuration @xmath21 at most one",
    "electron changes its state ( the site- or @xmath72 label ) per spin sector , the ratio @xmath73 which determines the probabilities and @xmath74 , can be calculated in a number of operations that is linear in the size of the system , if one already has the transposed inverse of the slater matrices available@xcite .",
    "once an ensemble of random walkers with weight determined by the trial wave function has been prepared , as described in the previous subsection , the monte carlo projection is done according to ( [ prod ] ) .",
    "for a given walker , all possible moves are considered , and for each move , the ratio s @xmath75 are calculated .",
    "this operation corresponds to a dot - product@xcite , so the time needed to compute it is linear in the system size .",
    "if @xmath75 is positive , the step to @xmath21 is allowed .",
    "the probability factor @xmath76 of allowed monte carlo moves are stored in an ordered table in which each element is the sum of the previous element and the probability factor @xmath77 for a hop or @xmath78 for a spin flip .",
    "the last element is the sum of the one but last element and the probability factor for staying , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the total _",
    "potential _ energy of @xmath47 . in this way",
    ", the value of the last element equals @xmath81 ; the random decision to select a move or to stay is then made by deciding between which elements of the ordered table the product of a random number between 0 and 1 and @xmath82 falls , using the numerical recipes routine _ locate_@xcite .",
    "the first stage of the diffusion implementation of the projection is a thermalization . during this stage",
    ", the parameter @xmath24 in ( [ projector ] ) @xmath83 is adjusted in such a way that the ensemble of walkers stabilizes under the branching process by which the multiplicities of the walkers are updated ; @xmath24 approaches the measured ground state energy in this process .",
    "after the thermalization , the usual quantity being measured in a green s function monte carlo is the _",
    "mixed estimator _",
    "@xmath84 for the _ local value _ of an operator @xmath85 , @xmath86 /\\psi_{\\text{t}}(r).\\ ] ] the mixed - estimator is directly measured in the fnmc program , but a better estimate for an expectation value is obtained by assuming that the trial state is close to the ground state and neglecting quadratic terms in the difference  @xcite : @xmath87 we will refer to the right hand side as the _",
    "best estimate_.    operators which are diagonal , like the @xmath88 spin correlation function are most efficiently calculated , since for off - diagonal terms computation of the ratio s @xmath89 takes substantial computer time .",
    "in our fnmc , @xmath23 needs to be small enough that @xmath25 projects onto the ground state . and large enough that the convergence is sufficiently rapid@xcite .",
    "we typically work with an ensemble of on average @xmath90 walkers . in one _ interval _",
    ", all walkers are propagated during @xmath91 time steps before branching .",
    "@xmath91 is chosen such that the multiplicity factors @xmath38 remain less than 2 .",
    "after a thermalization of @xmath92 intervals , statistics is accumulated in @xmath93 blocks of @xmath94 intervals each . in principle , the blocks are treated as independent measurements , and occasionally we check whether these are sufficiently independent indeed . if necessary",
    ", we increase @xmath94 to make them more independent ; an example of this will be discussed in section v. the values of all these parameters used in the simulations will be listed in the figure captions .",
    "as a first test of the fnmc on the klm we compare with exact diagonalization results by yamamoto and ueda@xcite .",
    "the coupling constant is @xmath95 , and the system consists of six sites with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the trial wave functions we use are as described in section iv.b .    in fig .  2 we plot the fnmc energy as a function of @xmath97 , defined in ( [ beq ] )",
    "note that the energy estimates are above the exact ground state energy , as they should be@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we see that the minimum is quite flat in the range @xmath98 , and very close to the exact value ( note the vertical scale ! ) .",
    "thus , our estimate for the ground state energy one is quite independent of the trial wave function  apparently , therefore , while the variational energies do depend stronly on @xmath97 , the projected energies are not very much affected by the fixed - node constraints over some range of values of @xmath97 .",
    "finally , also note that the statistical fluctuations are smaller close to the optimal value of @xmath97 , @xmath99 , in agreement with the general trend that fluctuations are smaller the better the ground state is approximated , and that statistical fluctuations are reduced if there is a gap in the excitation spectrum@xcite ( the 1@xmath0 klm does have a gap ) .",

    "4a really has a minimum .",
    "the exact diagonalization result@xcite @xmath105 is also indicated in the picture .",
    "clearly , also in this case the fnmc projection method is able to come quite close to the exact energy even if we start from a trial state that has a bad energy , and the statistical fluctuations are again smallest close to the minimum in fnmc energy .",

    "if it is a flip from @xmath3-up to @xmath3-down , one determinant becomes singular .",
    "if it is a flip with f - down to f - up , one matrix becomes non - singular , and its transposed inverse needs to be calculated , for facilitating the calculation of transition probabilities of subsequent steps . except for this more complicated calculation of @xmath127 , the fnmc program is the same as described before .    fig .",
    "7 illustrates how the fnmc projection proceeds as the number of iterations increases .",
    "first , one observes projection on the ground state : the energy measured over a number of monte carlo time steps , a block , drops .",
    "then , there are fluctuations around a mean value .",
    "accumulating statistics leads to a reduction of the error bars .",
    "one observes that the measurements in consecutive blocks are not independent .",
    "the correct error bar is obtained by grouping @xmath128 measurements together and thus dividing the @xmath129 blocks in @xmath130 measurements .",
    "after this regrouping , one has fewer values , but they are more independent .",
    "the error bars this gives are plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "7 : the value of the plateau is the error bar we report in the energy dispersion curve ( all error bars in energies are obtained this way ) .",
    "the fnmc dispersion of the spin soliton , for @xmath131 , on 20 sites , is presented in fig .",
    "since the @xmath107 value is @xmath132 , and the minimum of the dispersion is at @xmath133 , the gap we obtain in fnmc approximation is @xmath134 , which is in agreement with the results shown in fig .",
    "3 of wang _ et al . _ using a gutzwiller - projected mean - field approximation , and those of yu and white@xcite using the density matrix renormalization group method .",
    "so , while the energies in both the @xmath107 and the @xmath108 sector drop relative to the one estimated with the gutzwiller - projected mean - field wave function , the _ difference _ between the @xmath107 and the @xmath108 ground state energies is essentially the same as what is known to be the correct value@xcite .",
    "we have applied the lattice fnmc method to the 1@xmath0 klm .",
    "we observe that , for small lattices , quite accurate ground state energy estimates are obtained , even if the starting trial wave function gives quite a bad approximation to the energy . in the fnmc ,",
    "the energy estimate is always above the exact ground state energy , but in the cases studied here , they are only slightly above the exact values for a large range of values in the variational trial wave . over the same range over which a good ground state energy estimate is obtained , reasonably accurate values for correlation functions in fnmc approximation are obtained , which again are rather independent of the starting trial - state of the klm . to be able to calculate a dispersion of an excitation , one needs a conserved quantity , such that the lowest energies in different sectors can be compared  e.g. , the isospin gap@xcite of the klm can not be obtained within our fnmc , but the spin - gap can , since for its determination only ground state energies of different spin sectors are needed .",
    "if inversion symmetry is present , one does not need to use complex phases and the fnmc method for a real wave function can be applied .    in the present case",
    ", therefore , the fnmc appears to work well , in that the constraint imposed by the fixed node condition do not appear to have a dramatic effect on the energies and correlation functions over a reasonably large range of values of @xmath97 .",
    "unfortunately , as long as we lack more fundamental insight in the sign structure of the fermion wavefunction , it is difficult to say whether this is just one lucky example , or a robust property .",
    "of course , in the present case our trial wave function has properly built in the tendency of the @xmath8 and @xmath3-spins to form singlets , and our fixed - node estimates are not good in the extreme limits @xmath135 ( no local singlet correlations ) and @xmath136 ( tightly bound singlets ) .",
    "for the smaller lattice sizes we have considered here , the sign problem does not appear to be so severe@xcite , but for the larger lattice sizes , like those needed to study the spin triplet excitation or domain walls in de two - dimensional hubbard model@xcite , the advantages of the fnmc are more prominent .",
    "our results also throw new light on our own earlier results for domain walls in the two - dimensional hubbard model@xcite . in these simulations , we compared ground state energies starting from a homogeneous trial state and from a domain wall trial state .",
    "although the lowest energy state was found when applying a fnmc projection to a domain wall trial state , the ground state energy obtained after fnmc projection of a homogeneous trial state was found to be relatively close . since it is conceivable that , e.g. , domain wall type correlations do build up during the projection of a homogeneous trial state , a study of the correlation functions",
    "is needed before clear conclusions can be drawn .",
    "we are grateful to p.j.h .",
    "denteneer for illuminating discussions and in particular to j.m.j .",
    "van leeuwen for introducing us to the subject and for discussions and advice .",
    "for further discussion of the problems concerning complex lattice problems and possible generalizations of the fixed - node method we refer to h. j. m. van bemmel , thesis leiden university , 1995 ( available from the authors ) .",
    "the name ` fixed - node ' is actually a slight misnomer for our method , since the nodes of a wave function are not always properly defined for a discrete configuration space . in our method , the domains where the trial wave has a given sign are held fixed .",
    "because in this case the sign flip in eq.([condition ] ) always corresponds to a change in sign of the trial wave function , the sign flip potential @xmath74 is the same as the ` nodal boundary potential ' used before@xcite ; the term sign flip potential introduced later@xcite is more widely applicable ."
