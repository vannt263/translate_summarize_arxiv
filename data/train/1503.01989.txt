    "the recent far reaching work of agol @xcite and wise @xcite proves that a word hyperbolic group @xmath2 acting properly and cocompactly on a cat(0 ) cube complex must be virtually special , implying that @xmath2 has a finite index subgroup which embeds in a right angled artin group ( raag ) .",
    "a host of very strong conclusions then apply to the group @xmath2 , of which the two that will concern us here are being linear ( which we take to mean over @xmath3 although it is even true over @xmath4 ) and ( if @xmath2 is not elementary ) being large , namely @xmath2 has a finite index subgroup surjecting to a non abelian free group .    however , if @xmath2 is a finitely presented non hyperbolic group acting properly and cocompactly on a cat(0 ) cube complex , then the above consequences need no longer hold , indeed @xmath2 can even be simple @xcite",
    ". therefore suppose we have a class of finitely presented groups which is believed to be a well behaved class , but which contains both word hyperbolic and non word hyperbolic examples .",
    "we can ask : first , do all examples in this class have a nice geometric action , namely a proper cocompact action on a cat(0 ) cube complex , and second : do they all enjoy our strong group theoretic properties which are a consequence of being a virtually special group , namely being linear or being large .",
    "note that for non word hyperbolic groups , satisfying this geometric condition will not necessarily imply these group theoretic properties .    in this paper",
    "the classes of groups we will be interested in are the following three : groups of the form @xmath5 for @xmath6 a free group of finite rank @xmath7 and @xmath8 an automorphism of @xmath6 ( we refer to these as `` free - by - cyclic groups '' ) ; the more general class of ascending hnn extensions @xmath9 of finite rank free groups , where rather than @xmath10 having to be an automorphism , as in the free - by - cyclic case , we allow @xmath10 to be any injective endomorphism of @xmath6 ; and finally the class of groups admitting a presentation with 2 generators and 1 relator , which we refer to as 2-generator 1-relator groups .",
    "this last class neither contains nor is contained in either of the other two classes but there is considerable overlap .    in the free - by - cyclic case , it was recently shown in @xcite that such word hyperbolic groups do act properly and cocompactly on a cat(0 ) cube complex , and therefore are virtually special groups .",
    "however gersten in @xcite gave an example of a free - by - cyclic group which can not act properly and cocompactly on any cat(0 ) space , so this result can not hold in general in the non word hyperbolic case .",
    "moreover @xcite,@xcite shows that there are free - by - cyclic groups which are not automatic , whereas groups that act nicely on cat(0 ) cube complexes are automatic @xcite . in gersten",
    "s example the free group has rank 3 but in section 2 we consider free - by - cyclic groups of the form @xmath11 , none of which are word hyperbolic .",
    "therefore it is of interest to show directly that they act properly and cocompactly on cat(0 ) cube complexes , which we do in section 2 .",
    "this work is based on unpublished work of bridson and lustig .",
    "those authors give us the method of changing the natural topological model of the standard 2 complex ( shown in figure [ 2complex ] ) to get rid of a pocket of positive curvature , and in this way they go on to show that these groups act on 2-dimensional cat(0 ) complexes .",
    "we expand on this by showing that one can build these complexes from squares .",
    "this also strengthens a result of t. brady @xcite who showed that there is a 2-complex of non - positive curvature made from equilateral triangles with fundamental group @xmath11 .",
    "in section 3 we consider 2-generator 1-relator groups .",
    "it is conceivable , but very definitely open , that a word hyperbolic 2-generator 1-relator group always acts properly and cocompactly on a cat(0 ) cube complex ( for instance see @xcite conjecture 1.9 ) .",
    "however on moving to the non word hyperbolic case we see a different picture emerging because a group acting properly and cocompactly on any cat(0 ) space can not contain a baumslag - solitar group @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "thus the examples of such nasty baumslag - solitar groups as @xmath14 mean that we need not always have largeness nor linearity , or even residual finiteness .",
    "in fact even restricting to residually finite 2-generator 1-relator groups will not imply linearity in general .",
    "this is because it was shown in @xcite that the group @xmath15 is not linear over any field if @xmath16 , and it was pointed out in @xcite that the group @xmath17 which is indeed a 2-generator 1-relator group @xmath18 that is known to be residually finite , contains this as an index 2 subgroup when @xmath19 .",
    "however , in looking for a `` large '' property that we hope is held by all 2-generator 1-relator groups except for the soluble groups @xmath20 and @xmath4 , including the non residually finite groups , we are led to the concept of a group @xmath2 being sq - universal : namely that every countable group embeds in a quotient of @xmath2 .",
    "it was conjectured by p.m.neumann in @xcite back in 1973 that a non cyclic 1-relator group is either sq - universal or isomorphic to @xmath20 .",
    "now it was shown in @xcite that a group having a 1-relator presentation with at least 3 generators is sq - universal , leaving the 2-generator 1-relator case .",
    "also @xcite from 1995 showed that all non elementary word hyperbolic groups are sq - universal and this was generalized to non elementary groups which are hyperbolic relative to any collection of proper subgroups in @xcite from 2007 .",
    "recently the concept of a group being acylindrically hyperbolic , which is more general than being hyperbolic with respect to a collection of proper subgroups and which implies sq - universality , was introduced in @xcite and studied in @xcite where one application was to 2-generator 1-relator groups .",
    "the authors divided these groups into three classes with the first consisting of groups that they could show were acylindrically hyperbolic .",
    "we prove in theorem [ sqcs2 ] that all the groups in their second case , which they show are not acylindrically hyperbolic , are indeed sq - universal unless equal to @xmath20 .",
    "in fact every group here is formed by taking an hnn extension with base equal to a quotient of some free - by - cyclic group @xmath5 for @xmath8 finite order , along with infinite cyclic edge groups .",
    "the proof proceeds by also identifying them as generalized baumslag - solitar groups , whereupon we show more generally in theorem [ sqcs2 ] that any generalized baumslag - solitar group either is sq - universal or is isomorphic to @xmath20 or @xmath4 .",
    "this leaves their third case , which is exactly the class of 2-generator 1-relator groups that are ascending hnn extensions of finite rank free groups .",
    "here we are not quite able to establish sq - universality of all of these groups not equal to @xmath20 or @xmath4 , though it is known to hold for the free - by - cyclic case , but we do show in corollary [ sq ] that the only possible exception would be a 2-generator 1-relator group equal to a strictly ascending hnn extension of a finite rank free group which either fails to be word hyperbolic and contains no baumslag - solitar subgroup , or does contain a baumslag - solitar subgroup ( but does not contain @xmath21 ) and where all finite index subgroups have first betti number equal to 1 . in both cases",
    "it is conjectured that no such examples exist , so we have established p.m.neumanns conjecture for all the known 2-generator 1-relator groups .",
    "we also obtain some general unconditional statements , such as corollary [ comm ] which says that if the relator is in the commutator subgroup of @xmath22 then @xmath2 is sq - universal or equal to @xmath21 .    in the final section",
    "we show that free - by - cyclic groups formed using an automorphism @xmath8 of polynomial growth are not hyperbolic relative to any collection of proper subgroups ( thus sq - universality can not be established for all free - by - cyclic groups using only the result of @xcite ) , but are acylindrically hyperbolic unless @xmath8 has finite order as an outer automorphism .    in our final class of ascending hnn extensions of finitely generated free groups ,",
    "it was shown for the word hyperbolic case in @xcite that @xmath9 acts properly and cocompactly on a cat(0 ) cube complex if @xmath10 is an irreducible endomorphism , although that still leaves the case where @xmath10 is not irreducible but @xmath9 is word hyperbolic . as for a non word hyperbolic group of the form @xmath9 , there are some results on largeness for these groups in @xcite which are not quite exhaustive but make it likely that largeness holds throughout",
    ". however the example mentioned above of the injective endomorphism @xmath23 of the rank two free group @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 both having modulus greater than 1 , shows that @xmath9 need not be linear over any field . moreover the possible existence in the non word hyperbolic case of baumslag - solitar subgroups @xmath20 where @xmath27 again means that such a group need not have a proper cocompact action on any cat(0 ) space .",
    "we finish by showing in theorem [ sap ] that the work in @xcite and the agol - wise machinery answers problem 17.108 in the recent edition of the kourovka notebook @xcite , namely that sapir s example of a strictly ascending hnn extension of @xmath22 is indeed linear .",
    "we would like to thank martin bridson and martin lustig for allowing us to reproduce the results from @xcite here .",
    "as mentioned before there are many nice consequences of word hyperbolic groups acting properly and cocompactly on cat(0 ) cube complexes . however , no automorphism of @xmath22 is hyperbolic since they all fix the conjugacy class of @xmath28^{\\pm1}$ ] , therefore , agol s theorem does not apply and the complexes constructed are not known to be virtually special , though , due to the work of various authors the groups are virtually special .    however , there are still advantages to having a group act on a cat(0 ) cube complex . for instance , abelian subgroups are quasi - isometrically embedded , and such groups are biautomatic @xcite,@xcite and have a deterministic solution to the word problem in quadratic time @xcite .",
    "groups which act on cat(0 ) square complexes have the further nice property that all of their finitely presented subgroups also act properly and cocompactly on cat(0 ) square complexes .",
    "this is proved using a tower argument ( see @xcite , p .",
    "217 ) and the fact that a sub complex of a non - positively curved square complex is itself a non - positively curved square complex ( this may fail in higher dimensions ) .",
    "the construction also shows that for @xmath22-by-@xmath4 groups their geometric dimension is equal to their cat(0 ) dimension , namely 2 .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of cat(0 ) geometry for which the standard reference is @xcite .",
    "we say a metric space is _ non - positively curved _ if for each point there is a neighbourhood which is cat(0 ) .    in the following we will study 2 dimensional piecewise euclidean ( @xmath29 ) complexes .",
    "these are complexes built from polygonal subsets of @xmath30 by gluing along edges , whereupon we put the natural path metric on the resulting complexes .",
    "for full details see @xcite .",
    "square complexes are special examples of @xmath29 complexes where all the cells are squares .",
    "the following theorems of gromov @xcite allow one to check whether a complex is non - positively curved just by looking at the links of vertices .",
    "@xcite a @xmath29 complex with finitely many isometry types of cells is non positively curved if and only if the link of each vertex is a cat(1 ) space .    in the two dimensional case",
    "the link of any vertex is a graph and so this can be reduced to the following .",
    "@xcite a graph is cat(1 ) if it contains no circuits of length less than @xmath31 .",
    "we say that an action is _ proper _ if for each compact set @xmath32 the set @xmath33 is finite .",
    "as these groups will be the fundamental groups of non - positively curved spaces , they have an action on the universal cover .",
    "since the spaces are compact the action will be proper and cocompact and it will also be a free action since these groups are torsion free .",
    "the groups @xmath34 that we shall be concerned with are mapping tori of @xmath35 by a single automorphism @xmath36 .",
    "these groups have presentations of the form @xmath37    we start by considering the case of automorphisms which are of finite order .",
    "if @xmath38 has order @xmath39 in @xmath40 then @xmath34 is the fundamental group of a non - positively curved 2-complex .",
    "furthermore , this is finitely covered by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a graph with fundamental group @xmath43 .",
    "every finite order automorphism @xmath44 of @xmath43 can be realised as an isometry of a finite graph @xmath42 ; see for instance @xcite theorem 2.1 .",
    "let @xmath45 /(x,0)\\sim",
    "( \\phi(x),1)$ ] .",
    "@xmath46 is locally isometric to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a contractible subset of a graph .",
    "this will be cat(0 ) and so @xmath46 is non - positively curved .",
    "if we take the cover corresponding to the obvious map to @xmath49 this will be @xmath50 .",
    "we now want to look at automorphisms of infinite order .",
    "we require the following lemmas to ensure that we account for the general case with our construction .",
    "@xmath34 is defined up to isomorphism by @xmath51\\in \\textnormal{out}(f_2)$ ] .",
    "if @xmath52 , for @xmath53 the inner automorphism conjugation by @xmath54 , then @xmath55    @xmath34 is defined up to isomorphism by the conjugacy class of @xmath51\\in   \\textnormal{out}(f_2)$ ] .",
    "let @xmath56 then the following map defines an isomorphism .",
    "@xmath57    as such we will restrict to conjugacy in @xmath58 .",
    "in what follows we will need the following matrices : @xmath59    let @xmath60 be a matrix .",
    "then at least one of @xmath61 or @xmath62 is conjugate to a matrix with all non - negative coefficients .",
    "we will split into 2 cases .",
    "first we will deal with the case of matrices with no entry equal to 0 .",
    "conjugating and multiplying by @xmath63 , we may assume that @xmath64 .",
    "we may now replace @xmath54 by @xmath65 to make @xmath66 .",
    "we note that every matrix of this form in @xmath67 can not have one negative entry , as if this is the case then we see @xmath68 .    we note that conjugation by @xmath69 changes the signs of @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "using this we can assume that @xmath72 , then we know that @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "if we are in the second case we are done , so we assume we are in the first case .",
    "we now conjugate by @xmath75 : @xmath76 we know that @xmath77 are @xmath78 so we see that @xmath79 .",
    "now @xmath80 so once again we know that @xmath81 are non - negative so @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath54 had an entry equal to 0 then either @xmath54 or @xmath83 is triangular .",
    "further conjugating by @xmath63 and multiplying by @xmath84 we can assume that @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we now have two cases ; namely @xmath87 . in the case where @xmath88 we can conjugate by @xmath69 to make @xmath89 . if @xmath90 then this matrix has order 2 and we do not worry about this case .",
    "the following lemmas are from @xcite .",
    "if @xmath54 is a non - diagonal matrix with all entries non - negative , then there is a subtraction of one row from another , which reduces the sum of the entries and produces a non - negative result .",
    "let @xmath91 with non - negative entries .",
    "then there is a unique sequence of row subtractions which keep @xmath54 non - negative and reduce it to @xmath92 or @xmath63 .",
    "we can think of these operations as multiplication by @xmath93 or @xmath94 which gives us the following result .",
    "the semigroup generated by @xmath95 and @xmath93 contains a conjugate of every infinite order matrix in @xmath96 .    as such we will only need to realise the automorphisms corresponding to these in our groups .",
    "we will now construct non - positively curved complexes with @xmath34 as their fundamental groups , when @xmath44 is in the semigroup generated by @xmath97    we see that from the above this gives us all @xmath22-by-@xmath4 groups .",
    "we start with the obvious 2-complex shown in figure [ 2complex ] for the automorphism @xmath98 .",
    "this has a repeated corner which means it can not support a metric of non - positive curvature .",
    "to get rid of the repeated corner we cut our building blocks along the dotted line identifying the triangles with the repeated corner , resulting in our basic building blocks shown in figure [ buildingblocks ] .    by the above lemmas we can without loss of generality assume that our automorphism has the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 or @xmath98 and @xmath10 is one of the following finite order automorphisms : @xmath101 we can assume that we only apply one of these and we do it at the end .",
    "this is because in @xmath102 the first and second give central elements whereas @xmath103 is equal to the composition @xmath104 , but @xmath105 .",
    "we can now glue these together to get an automorphism which is in the class defined previously , so up to isomorphism we have all groups @xmath34 .",
    "we do this in the following way : in figure 2 let @xmath106 so that we have the positive and the negative vertices @xmath107 at each end of @xmath108 .",
    "on performing the given gluing we have that @xmath107 are not identified , but if we further stick these two vertices together by identifying @xmath109 with @xmath110 respectively then the resulting 2-complex has fundamental group @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "now suppose that our automorphism @xmath99 , where @xmath10 is one of the four special finite order automorphisms above .",
    "for each @xmath113 between 0 and @xmath114 we have a copy @xmath115 of the 2-complex associated to either @xmath98 or @xmath116 in figure 2 which contains the edge @xmath117 .",
    "we then glue @xmath115 to @xmath118 by the identity between the @xmath119 , which means that the vertex @xmath120 is identified with @xmath121 .",
    "finally we glue @xmath122 back to @xmath123 by identifying the @xmath124 with @xmath109 so that @xmath125 becomes equal to @xmath126 .",
    "we say a vertex is at _ time @xmath113 _ if it is the vertex where @xmath127 and @xmath117 meet .    we start with the case of vertices of time not equal to 0 , thus these will be where our complexes @xmath128 and @xmath115 are glued together by the identity between the @xmath129 .",
    "the link of such a vertex is shown in figure [ links ] .",
    "we now want to assign angles such that there are no circuits of length less than @xmath31 .    if we assign angles as in figure [ buildingblocks ] , then we get two types of link as shown in figure [ links ] .",
    "figure [ links ] i ) corresponds to the automorphisms at the @xmath113-th stage both being @xmath116 or both being @xmath98 .",
    "figure [ links ] ii ) corresponds to when one automorphism is @xmath98 and one is @xmath116 .",
    "we can see in either case that the link has no circuits of length less than @xmath31 .",
    "we now look at the case of the vertex at time 0 .",
    "this will have to take into account the map @xmath10 .",
    "we can consider the link as being split into 2 halves as shown in figure [ linkhalves ] .",
    "the finite order maps defined earlier give vertex identifications .",
    "there are 16 possible links we may get in this way , corresponding to which automorphisms meet and to one of the 4 finite order automorphisms .",
    "all of these give a link which is homeomorphic to the 1 skeleton of a tetrahedron with the set of angles depicted in figure [ links ] .      with a more careful assignment of angles",
    "we can see that the complexes above can be made into square complexes .",
    "we split the automorphism @xmath44 into one of three types depending on its decomposition in the semigroup described earlier :    1 .",
    "@xmath130 or @xmath131 2 .",
    "@xmath132 or @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 3 .",
    "all other automorphisms .",
    "we will assign angles to our building blocks based on which meet at time @xmath113 .",
    "we have depicted the two cases of our building blocks meeting at a vertex .    in case 1 each time our building blocks meet , it will be of the type depicted in figure [ squares ] i ) . in this case",
    "we keep the angle assignment we had before and make the edges labelled @xmath136 or @xmath137 on the vertical sides of the two rectangles of length 2 and the other edges of length 1 .",
    "we then make the edge between the 2 triangles of length @xmath138 and subdivide the rectangles into squares of edge length 1 , thus replacing the two triangles with a new building block which is the square formed by gluing them together .",
    "the link of the original vertices in this complex are depicted in figure [ links2 ] i ) , where the edges corresponding to @xmath139 and @xmath140 have been suppressed as they have valence 2 .    in case 2 each time our building blocks meet , it will be of the type depicted in figure [ squares ] ii ) . in this case",
    "we collapse the triangles to lines and then subdivide the resulting rectangles into 2 squares of side length 1 .",
    "the link of the original vertices in this complex are depicted in figure [ links2 ] ii ) , where the edges corresponding to @xmath139 and @xmath140 have been suppressed as they have valence 2 .    in case 3",
    "we will have a mix of both figures [ squares ] i ) and ii ) and we collapse all the triangles to lines as we did for case 2 .",
    "this introduces degenerate squares from building blocks meeting as in figure [ squares ] i ) , which could affect the topology of the overall complex if there were a cylinder of such squares .",
    "however here this will not happen as the only time a cylinder of degenerate squares could occur is if our automorphism is in case 1 .",
    "the links of vertices in these complexes are depicted in figure [ case3links ] , where the edges corresponding to @xmath139 and @xmath140 have been suppressed as they have valence 2 .",
    "the case of edges of 0 length are the degenerate squares where in fact the two edges become identified .    in all the cases we see that the resulting complex will be a non - positively curved square complex .",
    "a countable group @xmath2 is said to be sq - universal ( standing for subgroup quotient ) if every countable group can be embedded in a quotient of @xmath2 .",
    "this immediately implies that @xmath2 contains a non abelian free group , and in turn is implied by @xmath2 being large ( having a finite index subgroup surjecting to a non abelian free group ) .",
    "however an infinite simple group @xmath141 containing @xmath22 would not be sq - universal , nor would a just infinite group such as @xmath142 for @xmath143 .    as for examples of groups which are sq - universal , we have all non elementary word hyperbolic groups by @xcite .",
    "this means that word hyperbolic groups with property ( t ) provide lots of further examples of groups which are sq - universal but not large .",
    "moreover by @xcite a finitely generated group which is hyperbolic relative to any collection of proper subgroups is sq - universal ( or virtually cyclic ) .",
    "an important class of groups in this area is 1-relator groups .",
    "it was shown in @xcite in 1978 that any group with a presentation of deficiency at least 2 ( thus any group having an @xmath26-generator 1-relator presentation for @xmath143 ) is large , leaving 2-generator 1-relator groups .",
    "the question of when such a group @xmath2 contains @xmath22 has been known for some time : yes , unless @xmath2 is isomorphic to a baumslag - solitar group of the form @xmath144 ( where @xmath145 ) or is cyclic .",
    "largeness is a different matter ; for instance @xcite showed that the group @xmath12 is large if and only if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are not coprime .",
    "in @xcite we undertook extensive computation suggesting that non large groups with a 2-generator 1-relator presentation are few and far between , however there are more than just baumslag - solitar examples .",
    "moreover we did not see a clean criterion that presented itself for conjecture but in the case of sq - universality there is a statement that appeared in @xcite in 1973 : a non cyclic 1-relator group is sq - universal unless it is isomorphic to @xmath144 , thus if true this would be equivalent to containing @xmath22 .",
    "there have been a few results in this area since then ; for instance @xcite showed in 1974 that a group with an @xmath26-generator 1-relator presentation for @xmath143 is sq - universal ( which was then subsumed by the largeness result mentioned above ) . as for 2-generator 1-relator groups ,",
    "edjvet s thesis @xcite proves sq - universality in some useful cases .",
    "we showed in @xcite corollary 7.5 that it is true if the group is lerf but that is a very strong condition to impose .",
    "recently the concept of a group being acylindrically hyperbolic was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it holds if our group is non elementary and is relatively hyperbolic with respect to a collection of proper subgroups .",
    "we will not need the definition here , just the fact also in @xcite that such a group is sq - universal .",
    "this was followed up in @xcite where the theory was applied to various situations , including 1-relator groups to obtain the following . here",
    "a subgroup @xmath146 of a group @xmath2 is @xmath147-normal in @xmath2 if @xmath146 is infinite and moreover @xmath148 is infinite for all @xmath149 .",
    "the relevance of this is that an @xmath147-normal subgroup of an acylindrically hyperbolic group must also be acylindrically hyperbolic , so for instance @xmath150 being @xmath147-normal in @xmath2 implies that @xmath2 is not acylindrically hyperbolic ( though it could certainly be sq - universal or even large ) .",
    "[ 1rel2gen ] ( @xcite proposition 4.20 ) let @xmath2 be a group with two generators and one defining relator .",
    "then at least one of the following holds :    * @xmath2 is acylindrically hyperbolic ; * @xmath2 contains an infinite cyclic @xmath147-normal subgroup .",
    "more precisely , either @xmath2 is infinite cyclic or it is an hnn - extension of the form @xmath151 of a 2-generator 1-relator group @xmath152 with non - trivial center , so that @xmath153 in @xmath146 for some @xmath154 .",
    "in the latter case @xmath146 is ( finitely generated free)-by - cyclic and contains a finite index normal subgroup splitting as a direct product of a finitely generated free group with an infinite cyclic group .",
    "* @xmath2 is isomorphic to an ascending hnn extension of a finite rank free group .",
    "moreover , the possibilities ( i ) and ( ii ) are mutually exclusive .",
    "thus this establishes that groups in class ( i ) are sq - universal .",
    "we will show the same for groups in ( ii ) then discuss results for ( iii ) .",
    "when considering groups in case ( ii ) , we will use the class of generalized baumslag - solitar , or gbs , groups .",
    "these can be defined as those finitely generated groups which act on a tree with infinite cyclic vertex and edge stablisers .",
    "the two recent papers @xcite and @xcite cover a lot of ground in this area and we now mention the points we will be using , referring to them for more detail .",
    "we can describe a gbs group using the graph of groups theory , where a finite graph ( possibly with loops and/or multiple edges ) has labels consisting of a non zero integer at each end of each edge .",
    "this label tells us the index of this edge group in the adjacent vertex group , which determines the subgroup uniquely . in general many different finite labelled graphs can give rise to isomorphic gbs groups .",
    "one operation that can be performed without change of the underlying group is an elementary collapse .",
    "this is when one end of an edge @xmath155 next to a vertex @xmath156 is labelled @xmath157 and the edge is not a self loop .",
    "we can then contract this edge and multiply all other labels next to @xmath156 by the label at the other end of @xmath155 . by doing this repeatedly",
    ", we may assume that any edge with an end labelled by @xmath157 is a self loop .",
    "note that all gbs groups have deficiency 1 , that is they admit a presentation with one more generator than relator . in particular",

    "for the first part we can use theorem c of @xcite .",
    "this states that the non cyclic finitely generated groups of cohomological dimension 2 that have an infinite cyclic @xmath147-normal subgroup are exactly the generalized baumslag - solitar groups .",
    "now a 1-relator group has cohomological dimension 2 if the relator is not a proper power by @xcite , but a proper power gives rise to a group with torsion , whereas the groups in case ( ii ) are all torsion free .",

    "as mentioned above we assume that the only edge labels equal to @xmath157 appear on self loops .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath42 contains more than one cycle ( here we include self loops as cycles ) then @xmath2 surjects to @xmath22 and so is sq - universal , because we introduce a stable letter for each cycle when forming @xmath2 , and all vertex subgroups can be quotiented out to leave only these stable letters which have no relations between them .",
    "it is also known that if @xmath42 is a tree then @xmath2 is virtually @xmath159 for @xmath160 which is large , hence so is @xmath2 .",
    "this can be seen by quoting proposition 4.1 of @xcite which states that a group is a gbs group with non trivial centre if and only if it is of the form @xmath5 with @xmath8 having finite order in @xmath161",
    ". now here @xmath2 will certainly have a non trivial centre , namely an element which is a common power of all the generators of the vertex subgroups as these form a generating set for @xmath2 .",
    "moreover in the case of a tree the surjective homomorphism @xmath10 from @xmath2 to @xmath4 has the property that no non trivial element of a vertex ( or edge ) group lies in its kernel , as if so then the whole vertex group does , thus so do the neighbouring edge groups and so on across the whole tree .",

    "thus the same element @xmath334 is in both @xmath162 and @xmath340 , hence by malnormality they are equal and we have @xmath344",
    ". we can now continue contracting until we are left with the root , concluding that all of @xmath345 lies in @xmath162 , thus @xmath2 is not relatively hyperbolic with respect to proper subgroups .",
    "this adds to results in the literature that provide a description of free - by - cyclic groups according to the type of hyperbolicity : for @xmath244 we have that : + @xmath2 is word hyperbolic if and only if no positive power of @xmath8 sends @xmath346 to a conjugate of itself .",
    "+ @xmath2 is relatively hyperbolic if and only if @xmath249 $ ] is not of polynomial growth .",
    "( the if direction requires one to accept the results of the unpublished manuscript @xcite where the peripheral subgroups are the mapping tori of the polynomially growing subgroups under @xmath249 $ ] of @xmath6 , whereas the only if direction comes from theorem [ poly ] . )",
    "+ @xmath2 is acylindrically hyperbolic but not relatively hyperbolic if and only if @xmath249 $ ] is polynomially growing and of infinite order in @xmath161 .",
    "( the same comment as above applies here , with `` if '' and `` only if '' reversed . )",
    "+ @xmath2 is not acylindrically hyperbolic if and only if @xmath249\\in\\mbox{out}(f_k)$ ] has finite order .",
    "this leaves us with strictly ascending hnn extensions of finite rank free groups , which we have seen can be less well behaved and indeed need not be linear .",
    "however we finish with an example to show that the recent work of hagen and wise in @xcite on cubulation of ascending hnn extensions of finitely generated free groups solves a problem in the kourovka notebook @xcite on linearity of a particular group of this kind .",
    "problem 17.108 asks whether the group below is linear .",
    "the group is clearly a strictly ascending hnn extension of a finitely generated free group using the injective endomorphism @xmath348 of @xmath22 .",
    "corollary 6.20 of @xcite states that this group is virtually special , and hence linear over @xmath4 , if @xmath10 is irreducible and the hnn extension is word hyperbolic . here a reducible endomorphism @xmath10 of @xmath6 is one where there is a free product decomposition @xmath349 for @xmath350 and where each @xmath351 is non trivial ( though @xmath162 might be in which case @xmath352 ) such that @xmath353 is sent into a conjugate of @xmath354 with @xmath113 considered modulo @xmath355 .",
    "theorem a in @xcite considered the word hyperbolicity of strictly ascending hnn extensions of a finite rank free group @xmath356 and came up with a result when the endomorphism @xmath10 is an immersion , which is defined to mean that for all @xmath357 with @xmath358 , the word @xmath359 admits no cancellation ( so called because the standard selfmap of the @xmath360-petalled rose is an immersion ) .",
    "this implies that if @xmath361 is written as a reduced word on @xmath46 for @xmath362 then no cancellation can occur on the right hand side of @xmath363 .",
    "thus the word length of @xmath364 is the sum of that for the @xmath365 .",
    "this theorem states that if there is no periodic conjugacy class , meaning that there is no @xmath366 and @xmath367 such that @xmath368 is conjugate to @xmath369 in @xmath356 , then the strictly ascending hnn extension @xmath370 is word hyperbolic . we can apply this to our group as @xmath10 is indeed an immersion and the fact that each generator maps to a word of length two implies that the word length of @xmath368 is @xmath371 times that of @xmath228 .",
    "but we can assume by conjugating that @xmath228 is cyclically reduced , in which case @xmath368 is also cyclically reduced , as will be @xmath369 whose word length is @xmath190 times that of @xmath228 .",
    "now if @xmath368 and @xmath369 are both cyclically reduced and are conjugate in @xmath22 then they must have the same length and be cyclic permutations of each other , thus @xmath372 .",
    "next suppose the word length of @xmath228 is even and set @xmath373 for @xmath374 both half the length of @xmath228 .",
    "we have @xmath375 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath376 and so is equal to @xmath377 without cancellation in this expression , where @xmath378 ( but @xmath355 and @xmath147 are not necessarily of equal length ) .",
    "thus @xmath379 . as an immersion",
    "must be injective , we obtain @xmath380 and @xmath381 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath382 .",
    "thus we can continue to cut @xmath228 in half at each stage until it has odd length , whilst still preserving the fact that @xmath368 is a cyclic conjugate of @xmath376 .",
    "when we reach this point , we consider the number of appearances of @xmath383 and @xmath384 in @xmath228 , which can not be equal , thus nor can it be equal for @xmath376 or for any cyclic conjugate thereof .",
    "but as @xmath385 and @xmath386 both have equal exponent sums , this is true for any element in the image of @xmath228 which is a contradiction .    now showing irreducibility of an endomorphism is straightforward in rank 2 because any proper non trivial free factor is just the cyclic group generated by a primitive element .",
    "thus to show @xmath10 is irreducible it is enough to rule out there being a primitive element @xmath275 such that @xmath387 or @xmath388 is conjugate to @xmath389 for some @xmath390 .",
    "but this has been eliminated for @xmath391 , and also for @xmath392 by considering @xmath388 and @xmath393 respectively .",
