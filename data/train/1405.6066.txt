    "in particular , @xmath84 will be replaced by ( [ 2.26 ] ) before differentiation .",

    "the conclusion is that if the @xmath1cdm metric is represented in the form ( [ 2.12 ] ) , then , by applying a linear transformation to @xmath5 , one can assure that at the ah @xmath5 is the same in both models and @xmath27 is the same in both models .",

    "this is the point that was not taken care of in ref .",
    "it was assumed there that the two @xmath5-coordinates are the same , but they were not . however , all the qualitative conclusions from the comparison of the two light cones formulated there remain correct .    in order to make the two @xmath5-coordinates compatible",
    ", one must apply the transformation @xmath504 to the @xmath5 of @xmath1cdm and choose the constant @xmath505 so that the @xmath7 curves of the two models both pass through the point @xmath506 .",
    "this is how both panels in our fig .",
    "[ drawzfullrange ] were constructed .",
    "the @xmath5-coordinate of the @xmath1cdm model was transformed in the same way in fig .",

    "their @xmath5 , @xmath17 and @xmath84 coincide with ours . from their ( 7 ) , ( 21 ) and ( 23 )",
    "it follows that their @xmath507 from our ( [ 2.26 ] ) , ( [ 2.27 ] ) and ( [ 4.1 ] ) it follows that      then , from their ( 7 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 27 ) and ( 32 ) it follows that @xmath509 so , our @xmath31 and @xmath195 given by ( [ 9.1 ] ) and ( [ 9.2 ] ) translate to their @xmath510 .",
