    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be nonnegative integers and let @xmath2 be the set of such generalised tournaments , in which every pair of distinct players is connected at most with @xmath3 , and at least with @xmath4 arcs .",

    "an arbitrary vector @xmath5 of nonnegative integers is called _ graphical vector , _ iff there exists a loopless multigraph whose degree vector is @xmath7 , and @xmath7 is called _ digraphical vector _ ( or _ score vector _ ) iff there exists a loopless directed multigraph whose out - degree vector is @xmath7 .",
    "a nondecreasingly ordered graphical vector is called _ graphical sequence _ , and a nondecreasingly ordered digraphical vector is called _ digraphical sequence _ ( or _ score sequence _ ) .",

    "e.g. in the papers @xcite the graphical sequences , while in the papers @xcite the score sequences were discussed .    even in the last two years many authors investigated the conditions , when @xmath7 is graphical ( e.g. @xcite ) or digraphical ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we deal only with directed graphs and usually follow the terminology used by k. b. reid @xcite .",
    "if in the given context @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fixed or non important , then we speak simply on _ tournaments _ instead of generalised or @xmath11-tournaments .",
    "we consider the loopless directed multigraphs as generalised tournaments , in which the number of arcs from vertex / player p@xmath18 to vertex / player p@xmath19 is denoted by @xmath24 , where @xmath24 means the number of points won by player p@xmath18 in the match with player p@xmath19 .    the first question : how one can characterise the set of the score sequences of the @xmath11-tournaments . or ,",
    "with another words , for which sequences @xmath7 of nonnegative integers does exist an @xmath11-tournament whose out - degree sequence is @xmath7 .",
