    "the investigations performed for @xmath8tis@xmath1 ( @xmath4 = mn , fe , co , ni ) @xcite show that the effect of intercalation on the chemical bonding is not consistent with the rigid band model @xcite often referred to in relation to these compounds .",
    "instead , the charge carriers localization due to the formation of covalent bonds with intercalant atoms seems to become important . from this point of view , the tise@xmath1-based intercalated materials are obviously even more interesting , because they demonstrate a higher degree of two - dimensionality in comparison with tis@xmath1 , as follows from their larger @xmath9 ratio ( 1.697 in pure tise@xmath1 vs. 1.672 in tis@xmath1 , see , e.g. , ref .   ) .",

    "experimentally obtained effective magnetic moment at the cr atom is roughly 1.5 times larger than that per co atom ( see table  [ tab : mom ] ) .",
    "this fact may be related to a stronger hybridization of @xmath25 orbitals ( those participating in the magnetic moment formation in the @xmath26 configuration of co@xmath16 ) with the se@xmath10 orbitals .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath25 orbitals are essentially empty in the @xmath27 configuration of cr@xmath17 .",
    "the deviation of the effective moment from its nominal free - ion value correlates well with the lattice distortion ( which is the measure of the chemical bonding between an intercalant and the host @xcite ) at least for concentrations @xmath28 as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdc ] .",
    "the systems with @xmath29 are actually beyond the percolation limit on the ordered lattice of @xmath3 `` impurities '' , so that their clustering and direct exchange interaction apparently results in the drop of magnetic moments and breakdown of the abovementioned correlation .",

    "@xmath30 is only weakly concentration - dependent , in cr@xmath0tise@xmath1 it exhibits an interesting behavior ",

    "two different types of @xmath32 are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : conduc ] for two cr concentrations .",
    "an overall decrease of @xmath30 as the unit cell parameter @xmath24 decreases ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : conduc ] ) is apparently due to the drop in the free charge carriers concentration as electrons are trapped in covalent bonds  this seems to be well the case at least in all co - containing systems . due to a different charge configuration of cr@xmath17",
    "as compared to co@xmath16 , one electron provided by cr remains free and contributes to the metallic type of conductivity  see the calculated density of states ( dos ) distribution at the impurity site , sec .",
    "[ sec : calcul ] .",
    "a drop in the conductivity near @xmath33=0.05 of cr probably indicates the compensation of highly mobile intrinsic ( hole - type ) carriers in tise@xmath1 , the concentration of which is 0.05 per formula unit@xcite .",
    "this is consistent with a perfectly metallic type of temperature dependency of conductivity for this concentration , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : conduc ] .",
    "another drop in @xmath31 at @xmath33=0.25 may be related to the percolation limit on a lattice of those ti atoms which have no cr neighbors .",
    "two ti atoms ( to both sides of the intercalated cr atom ) participate in the formation of localized bonds , and the percolation limit for two - dimensional hexagonal lattices equals 0.5 @xcite . for @xmath33=0.33 , differently from lower cr concentrations , the activation region is seen ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : conduc ] ) in the @xmath32 , indicating an opening of the band gap at the fermi level .",
    "it is noteworthy that at @xmath33=0.33 , exactly one extra electron is provided by cr per titanium atom .",
    "one can speculate that the gap formation is the consequence of spin splitting of the cr - ti hybridized band , since this band could exactly accommodate one electron per ti atom .",
    "no such gap is seemingly formed in co@xmath0tise@xmath1 , presumably because more efficient deformation of the host lattice results in more octahedral coordination of ti atoms by chalcogen , preventing the splitting between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 orbitals of ti @xcite .",
    "we refer to the xps spectra with three main purposes : to control the quality of monocrystalline samples , to get information about the electronic structure and to trace the effects of on - site magnetic interactions on the spectra .",
    "[ fig : ti2p ] and [ fig : xpscore ] depict the @xmath37 core levels of titanium and of intercalated elements , correspondingly .",
    "ti @xmath37 spectra are known to exhibit relatively large chemical shifts already at early oxidation states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the actual spectra indicate a good ( oxygen - free ) quality of samples .",
    "the chemical shift still present ( 455.0 ev for the ti@xmath5 binding energy in tise@xmath1 ; 455.5 ev in co@xmath23tise@xmath1 ; 455.8 ev in cr@xmath22tise@xmath1 ) exhibits the increase of ionicity from the host to co - based to cr - based systems @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with above discussed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a+c ] ) stronger @xmath38-contraction of the crystal lattice in more covalent co@xmath0tise@xmath1 , as compared to cr@xmath0tise@xmath1 .    of interest",
    "are the core @xmath37 photoemission spectra of intercalant atoms , which may exhibit an exchange splitting due to an intra - atomic @xmath37@xmath3 interaction ( similarly to what has been demonstrated for the mn - based heusler alloys@xcite ) . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : xpscore ] , the cr@xmath5 line in cr@xmath22tise@xmath1 clearly shows a splitting of about 1 ev , differently from the co@xmath5 spectrum of co@xmath20tise@xmath1 where no such splitting is observed . the splitting is qualitatively related to the difference between local magnetic moments in these compounds ( see table [ tab : mom ] ) .    the valence - band ( vb ) photoelectron spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xps+xes ] ) have a relatively simple structure , where the se@xmath39 contribution ( in the region of binding energies 1216 ev ) is clearly separated from the se@xmath10ti@xmath3@xmath4@xmath3 hybridized band spanning the binding energies 06 ev . in the latter band ,",
    "the contribution from the se@xmath10 states is the most pronounced , since the photoionization cross - section of selenium is much larger than for all other constituents @xcite .",
    "however , the contribution of cr@xmath3 and , in particular , co@xmath3 states is noticeable just below the fermi energy , similarly to the behavior detected for the fe@xmath3 states in fe@xmath0tite@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the calculated dos ( see next section ) shows that a narrow peak at @xmath191.5 ev below the fermi level , well separated from the bulk of se@xmath10 states , indeed dominates the local dos at the co site and must be visible in the valence - band xps .",
    "the trends in the `` local '' electronic structure of intercalant atoms depending on concentration are much better visible from x - ray emission spectra which are element - selective and hence not masked by the contributions from selenium states .",
    "the cr and co @xmath40 spectra ( @xmath41 transitions ) have been measured for several concentrations and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xes ] . based on the arguments of ref .",
    ", the concentration - related differences in the spectra can be traced to the percolation threshold on a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice at @xmath42 . above this threshold , the intercalant atoms ( under an uniform distribution )",
    "may have a neighbor of the same type at the distance of hexagonal lattice constant .",
    "it is noteworthy how the width and the relative intensity of @xmath43 and @xmath44 bands vary with the concentration .",
    "the cr @xmath40 spectra of intercalated compounds are quite different from those of pure metallic cr , whereas the corresponding differences for the co - based systems are less pronounced .",
    "a striking difference in the xes of co- and cr - intercalated systems is a much broader emission band in the latter , in spite of the fact that the widths of the occupied valence bands in both systems are presumably not too much different .",
    "the shift of the x - ray emission spectra by the @xmath5 core level binding energy onto the common energy scale with the xps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xps+xes ] ) makes obvious that the states above the nominal fermi level effectively participate in the emission process in cr@xmath22tise@xmath1 , but not in co - intercalated systems .",
    "another peculiarity of the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xes ] is the increase of the @xmath45 relative intensity in more diluted ( especially in cr - based ) systems .",
    "the broadening of @xmath43 spectra of @xmath3 components has been detected and discussed before  in @xmath3 oxides ( of mn @xcite and cu @xcite ) where charge - transfer excitations were argued to be an important mechanism responsible for a rich satellite structure , as well as in pure @xmath3 metals ( cu , @xcite ) where an initial - state @xmath3 vacancy satellite was shown to contribute on the high - energy side of the @xmath43 line for excitation energies beyond the @xmath46 threshold . for our systems in question , none of these mechanisms seem to work : charger - transfer excitations can not play an important role because of a much high covalency than in oxides ; as for shake - up / shake - off processes  it is difficult to argue why their intensity would be enhanced at low cr ( but not co ) concentrations . moreover , the increase of the high - energy satellite in cu @xmath40 in ref .",
    "@xcite is accompanied by the decrease of the @xmath45 intensity ratio ( due to the coster - kronig process )  the trend opposite to that observed in the present case .",
    "what makes the difference between low - concentrartion cr - intercalated system and other systems studied is relatively high localization of the cr@xmath3 state and high magnetic moment associated with it .",
    "it is noteworthy that in recently studied heusler alloys nimnsb and co@xmath1mnsb where the high magnetic moment at the mn site is similarly localized , the @xmath43 emission from the states nominally above the fermi level was observed @xcite . similarly to how it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite for heusler alloys , we tend to qualitatively attribute the anomalous x - ray emission in the diluted cr@xmath0tise@xmath1 system to a relaxation of the intermediate state with electronic configuration @xmath47 , which involves the contribution from the states of @xmath48 symmetry nominally vacant in the ground - state configuration @xmath49 .",
    "below , we shall refer to this effect for brevity as re - emission .",
    "strictly speaking , the excitation and subsequent emission in a resonant process must be treated as a single event ; an extensive literature exists on this subject ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the effect is the more pronounced the stronger the localization of involved states is .",
    "the peculiarity of our present spectra is that such typically resonance - like phenomenon as re - emission is observed in spite of high - energy ( i.e. non - resonance ) electronic excitation , with the excitation energy of nearly 4 kev , apparently due to sufficiently high lifetime of an electron trapped in a highly localized vacant cr @xmath3 state . for the co - intercalated systems ,",
    "the effect is practically not observable .",
    "assuming phenomenologically the participation of the lowest vacant cr @xmath3 states in the x - ray emission , we leave the ( otherwise single - particle ) quantitative treatment of the spectrum till next section where the microscopic information about the electronic structure becomes available .",
    "another important observation concerning the x - ray emission spectra is a substantial increase  especially at low intercalant concentrations  of the @xmath45 intensity ratio as compared to that in the pure metal . to our opinion , this indicates a localization of the @xmath3 electron density and hence a magnetic moment .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 bands originate from the dipole transitions @xmath50 and @xmath51 , correspondingly .",
    "the change in the @xmath45 relative intensity may be influenced by the selection rule on the total moment projection , @xmath52 , which in the present case favors a substantial decrease of the statistical weight of the @xmath50 transition , since the exchange interaction energy of @xmath3 electrons ( 22.5 ev ) by more than an order of magnitude exceeds their spin - orbit interaction energy .    as already mentioned above ,",
    "the changes in the observed @xmath45 weights distribution for systems with lower cr content is opposite to what one could expect from the coster - kronig transitions , which redistribute intensities from @xmath53 to the @xmath5 channel .",
    "this indicates a relative unrelevance of the coster - kronig effect for the systems in question .",
    "in ref .   we reported the results of a first - principles optimization of lattice parameters in pure tise@xmath1 ( as well as in tite@xmath1 ) and the electronic structure of @xmath3-intercalated systems , with the use of @xmath4(tise@xmath1)@xmath54 supercells in the latter case .",
    "the calculation has been done with the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave code wien97@xcite , using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the formulation by perdew , burke and ernzerhof@xcite .",
    "the hexagonal lattice parameters as found in the course of total energy minimization were @xmath55=3.519  , @xmath24=6.280  , whereas the experimental measurements give the values @xmath55=3.535  , @xmath24=6.004  ( as cited in ref .",
    "the internal coordinate @xmath38 ( the relative distance between ti and se layers ) is 0.247 in the calculation , compared to the measured value of 0.25 . at a first sight ,",
    "the gga overestimates the @xmath9 ratio by as much as 5% .",
    "however , considering the reduced value of @xmath38 in the calculation , one can notice that in reality just the van der waals gap between adjacent chalcogen planes is overestimated , whereas the lenghts of ti - ti and ti - se bonds remain well within 1% of the experimental estimate .",
    "the perdew  burke  ernzerhof formula for gradient approximation was optimally tuned for a certain degree of localization of the exchange - correlation hole , typical for bulk solids but not for the `` empty '' van der waals gap",
    ". some discussion on this subject can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present study",
    ", we consider systems with relatively high concentration ( @xmath56 per tise@xmath1 unit ) of intercalant atoms in the van der waals gap , therefore the abovementioned shortcoming of the gga treatment must be less serious than for pure dichalcogenides .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we simulated intercalated systems using the rhombohedral @xmath4(tise@xmath1)@xmath54 supercell , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scell ] ( in the hexagonal setting ) .",
    "similar supercells were earlier used in non - magnetic calculations by suzuki _",
    "et al._@xcite . with only one type of supercell being considered in _ ab initio _ calculations",
    ", it had little sense to address the systematical trends in the lattice parameters under doping .",
    "instead , we concentrated in our analysis on the properties of two intercalated systems as _ impurity _ systems .",
    "the calculations have been performed therefore in a fixed ( @xmath24 , @xmath55 ) frame , with a local atomic relaxation around the @xmath4 atoms taken into account .",
    "this allows us to make a more clear comparison of cr- and co - intercalated systems .",
    "from the following it becomes obvious that the noticeably perturbed region around an intercalant atom is indeed much smaller than the region defined by the translation vectors in the supercell of our choice .",
    "in the hexagonal setting , the supercell with the lattice constants @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scell ] ) hosts three @xmath4(tise@xmath1)@xmath54 units with the following atomic positions in one of them : @xmath4 at ( 0,0,0 ) ; ti at @xmath59 and at @xmath60 ; six se at @xmath61 ; @xmath62 ; @xmath63 .",
    "the optimized values of internal coordinates @xmath64 to @xmath65 , obtained from the condition that the forces on all atoms disappear , are listed in table [ tab : relax ] .",
    "the local structural distortion , as compared to the equilibrium structure of tise@xmath1 , is quite small .",
    "the negative value of @xmath65 corresponds to the displacement of the chalcogen planes towards the ti layers by 0.42% of the @xmath24 parameter of tise@xmath1 ; this corresponds roughly to @xmath66 rather than 0.25 found for pure tise@xmath1 .",
    "a qualitative difference between cr@xmath67tise@xmath1 and co@xmath67tise@xmath1 is that the nearest ti atoms approach the co atom ( @xmath64 slightly negative ) but are shifted away from the cr atom .",
    "this is consistent with the evidence of larger co  ti bonding and , contrarily , higher localization of the cr@xmath3 states as addressed below .    the spatial distribution of the charge density in a plane cut across the supercell is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_line ] .",
    "the vertical size of the plot covers 18.84  .",
    "one can see that in the absence of an @xmath4 atom the charge density between the se layers is indeed rather low , about 0.05 @xmath68/@xmath69 .",
    "an intercalant atom embedded in this region mediates the chemical bonding between chalcogen atoms .",
    "an effectively larger ( see below ) co atom provides a slightly higher charge density along the se@xmath4 line .",
    "moreover , the distrubution of the charge density along [ 001 ] ( i.e. , towards the nearest ti atoms ) is somehow different in cr- and co - intercalated crystals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_cont ] ) . on the co site ,",
    "the occupation of @xmath3 states is substantially higher as compared to cr , with the effect that the effective size of an intercalant atom is larger , in spite of a slightly higher contraction of the co@xmath3 states . at the same time , the occupation of the ti@xmath3 shell is lower in the vicinity of co next to a cr atom . the local dos distribution on the atoms in question ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) helps to understand the origins and energetics of this different charge distribution .    the center of gravity of the cr@xmath3 states lies closer to that of ti@xmath3 . in spite of large exchange splitting at the cr site ,",
    "a noticeable contribution from both atoms is present near the fermi level .",
    "specifically , mostly the @xmath70 orbitals at both cr and ti sites are responsible for this direct hybridization and the enhancement of the ti dos ( of the atoms neighboring to cr in the [ 001 ] direction ) near the fermi energy .",
    "this factor is not important in the co - intercalated system because the co@xmath3 states are lower in energy and do not mix so efficiently with ti@xmath3  in fact , the majority - spin band at the co site is fully occupied .",
    "apart from this enhancement of the direct cr ",
    "ti bonding , the distribution of electronic density ( spatial as well as energy - resolved ) within the tise@xmath1 remains largely unaffected by the presence of intercalant atoms and very much close to that of pure tise@xmath1 ( see ref .",
    "we notice however a difference of our electronic structure from that calculated for tise@xmath1 in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the use of the muffin - tin approximation ) .",
    "the local dos at the @xmath4 site contains spin - splitted and broadened levels , typical for a magnetic impurity embedded in the vb ( the latter being formed , in this case , by the ti@xmath3se@xmath10 hybridization ) .",
    "an anomalously narrow minority - spin peak appears at the co site because its energy position is between the separated subbands due to a bonding and antibonding ti",
    " se interaction ( see more detailed discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. the scattering of valence - band electrons at this impurity level is suppressed .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the crystal - field splitting and spatial distribution of the @xmath2 orbitals will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the present calculation for the ordered cr@xmath67tise@xmath1 structure failed to find an energy gap at the fermi level ( implied by the conductivity type as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conduc ] for @xmath33=0.33 ) .",
    "the reason may be either an effect of the lattice parameters change , important for the cr - intercalated systems but ignored in the present calculation , or the importance of correlation effects due to high cr@xmath3 localization , that would justify the use of a different ( orbital - dependent ) form of the total energy functional .",
    "this subject yet needs a further clarification .",
    "the values of local magnetic moments ( attributed to muffin - tin sphere sizes cited above ) are 2.81 @xmath71 for cr and 1.46 @xmath71 for co , that agrees well with the experimental values of table [ tab : mom ] for @xmath33=0.33 . in spite of a slight variation of the magnetic density over the crystal ( small antiparallel polarization of ti@xmath3 shells and parallel of the se@xmath10 shells )",
    ", the magnetic moment remains quite localized at the intercalant atom .",
    "for the values of the @xmath37 exchange splitting ( taken simply as energy differences between spin - up and spin - down components of self - consistently calculated relativistic core levels ) , we obtained 0.85 ev at the cr site and 0.59 ev at the co site .",
    "the former is in good agreement with the experimental estimate , and the latter is probably already too small to be resolved with the experimental resolution ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xpscore ] ) .    with the information about the local state density distribution at intercalant sites available , it becomes possible to address the problem of x - ray re - emission in the cr@xmath0tise@xmath1 systems with low @xmath33 content .",
    "an assumption of a strongly localized character of cr@xmath3 states is supported by the calculations of both spatial distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_line ] ) and the local dos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) .",
    "localized states in the vacant region ( which may host an absorbed electron in an intermediate state of a x - ray emission process ) must be necessarily those in the minority - spin channel . in order to imitate their possible participation in the x - ray re - emission , we calculated the cr@xmath40 x - ray emission spectrum , taking into account dipole transition matrix elements and the cutoff energy of 2 ev above the nominal fermi level , to allow the lowest minority - spin band localized at the cr site to contribute in full .",
    "this band incorporates more than two extra electrons , rather than one as would be the case in a simple intermediate - state model . however , there is no simple criterium to select only part of these low - lying vacant states for their possible contribution to the re - emission process .",
    "the result of a calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xes ] , top curve . without",
    "the fermi energy artificially shifted , the higher peak in both @xmath43 and @xmath44 bands is missing , so that the calculated spectrum is rather close to that of pure chromium .",
    "no such artificial adjustment was necessary for the co@xmath0tise@xmath1 system .",
    "as a result of this combined study incorporating measurements of the crystal structure , kinetic properties ( conductivity ) and the analysis of the electronic structure by different spectroscopic techniques ( xps and xes ) , interpreted on the basis of electronic structrure calculations , we establish the following . in spite of nominally identical magnetic moments of a free ion for cr and co , the saturation magnetization of intercalated tise@xmath1 reveals an almost two times larger effective moment on cr than that on co sites . a large exchange splitting in the cr@xmath3 shell polarizes",
    "the cr@xmath37 shell and leads to the exchange splitting of cr@xmath37 core levels large enough ( 0.9 ev ) to be detected by photoelectron spectroscopy .",
    "no such splitting was resloved for co@xmath37 levels .",
    "so different magnetic behavior can be traced to different strength of chemical bonding in cr- and co - intercalated systems .",
    "the bonding is stronger in co@xmath0tise@xmath1 , as is evidenced by larger distortion of the host lattice .",
    "the cr@xmath3 states , on the contrary , remain more localized , that favors a higher magnetic moment .",
    "another indication of higher localization of cr@xmath3 states in cr@xmath0tise@xmath1 is a strong contribution in the x - ray emission @xmath40 spectrum from above the nominal fermi level , observed even at excitation energies much higher than the threshold and tentatively attributed to re - emission .",
    "we emphasize that the exchange splitting of @xmath37 core levels and a strong re - emission due to high - energy electronic excitations are experimental findings quite rarely observed in @xmath3-based systems so far .",
    "the reported first - principles calculations provide an adequate description of the structural and magnetic properties and simplify at least a qualitative understanding of the underlying physics",
    ". however , an attempt to take into account correlation effects more systematically could be interesting for the treatment of highly localized cr@xmath3 states and of the excitation processes involving the latter .",
