    "we consider the accumulation of mutations in large asexual populations .",
    "the mutations that biological organisms accumulate over time can be classified into three categories : beneficial , neutral and deleterious .",
    "beneficial mutations increase the fitness of the individual carrying the mutation , while deleterious mutations decrease fitness ; neutral mutations have no effect on fitness .",
    "adaptation is driven by accumulation of beneficial mutations , but it is limited by _ clonal interference _ ( clones that carry different beneficial mutations compete with each other and interfere with the other s growth in the population ) .",
    "fisher and muller argued for the importance of this effect as early as the 1930s [ fisher ( @xcite ) , muller ( @xcite ) ] . here , we are concerned with the rate of adaptation , that is the rate of increase of mean fitness in the population .    the simplest scenario one can consider is one in which a single beneficial mutation arises in an otherwise neutral population and no further mutations occur until the fate of that mutant is known .",
    "this situation is well understood .",
    "the most basic question one can ask is what is @xmath3 , the fixation probability of the mutation .",
    "this was settled by haldane ( @xcite ) , who showed that under a discrete generation haploid model , if the selection coefficient associated with the mutation is @xmath4 , then under these circumstances @xmath5 . in this case , @xmath3 is almost independent of the population size , @xmath0 .",
    "when the mutation does fix , the process whereby it increases in frequency from @xmath6 to @xmath7 is known as a _ selective sweep_. the duration of a selective sweep is @xmath8 generations . if one assumes that the mutation rate per individual per generation is @xmath9 , then the overall mutation rate will be proportional to population size and we see that for large populations the assumption that no new mutation will arise during the timecourse of the sweep breaks down .",
    "instead one expects multiple overlapping sweeps . in an asexual population",
    ", mutations can only be combined if they occur sequentially within the same lineage .",
    "this means that , on the one hand , alleles occurring on the same lineage can boost one another s chance of fixation , but on the other hand alleles occurring on distinct lineages competitively exclude one another .",
    "the net effect is to slow down the progress of natural selection .",
    "this is an extreme form of the hill ",
    "robertson effect .",
    "hill and robertson ( @xcite ) were the first to quantify the way in which linkage between two sites under selection in a finite population ( whether sexually or asexually reproducing ) limits the efficacy of natural selection . in a sexually reproducing population",
    ", recombination breaks down associations between loci and so ameliorates the hill ",
    "robertson effect , suggesting an indirect selective force in favor of recombination .",
    "further quantitative analysis of the interference between selected loci is provided by barton ( @xcite ) who considers the probability of fixation of two favorable alleles in a sexually reproducing population .",
    "his method is only valid if the selection coefficient of the first beneficial mutation to arise is larger than that of the second .",
    "cuthbertson , etheridge and yu ( @xcite ) consider the same question in the general setting .",
    "the conclusion from both works is that fixation probabilities are reduced , sometimes drastically , because of interference between the two mutations .",
    "furthermore , if the second mutation is stronger than the first , then cuthbertson , etheridge and yu ( @xcite ) show that the strength of interference can be strongly dependent on population size . in this work",
    ", we do not consider the effects of recombination , since we only work with asexual populations .",
    "since all beneficial mutations eventually become either extinct or ubiquitous in the population , the rate of adaptation , defined to be the rate of increase of the mean fitness of the population , is proportional to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total number of beneficial mutations that occur to all individuals in the population in a single generation and we assume @xmath3 to be the same for all beneficial mutations , which is the case for the system in stationarity .",
    "if @xmath3 is independent of population size , then we expect an adaptation rate of @xmath12",
    ". however , a explained above , the occurrence of simultaneous selective sweeps reduces @xmath3 and so @xmath3 may not be @xmath13 .",
    "this leads to the following question : if one does not limit the number of simultaneous selective sweeps , what is @xmath3 , or equivalently , what is the rate of adaptation ? as @xmath14 , is the rate of adaptation finite or does it increase without bound ? there has been some controversy surrounding this question .",
    "some work [ e.g. , barton and coe ( @xcite ) ] suggests that there is an asymptotic limit to the rate of adaptation .",
    "other authors [ e.g. , rouzine , wakeley and coffin ( @xcite ) , wilke ( @xcite ) and desai and fisher ( @xcite ) ] argue that no such limit exists . here",
    ", we study this problem in a mathematically rigorous framework .    previous work on this question has adopted two general approaches : ( i ) calculate the fixation probability @xmath3 directly , and ( ii ) study the distribution of fitness of all individuals in the population and asks how this distribution evolves with time .",
    "the first approach was used in gerrish and lenski ( @xcite ) , wilke ( @xcite ) and barton and coe ( @xcite ) .",
    "gerrish and lenski ( @xcite ) were the first to present a quantitative analysis of the rate of adaptation in the presence of clonal interference .",
    "they obtained approximate integral expressions for the fixation probability of a beneficial mutation and thus the expected rate of adaptation .",
    "orr ( @xcite ) generalized the results of gerrish and lenski ( @xcite ) to include the effects of deleterious mutations .",
    "wilke ( @xcite ) combined the works of gerrish and lenski ( @xcite ) and orr ( @xcite ) to obtain approximate expressions for the adaptation rate that grow logarithmically or doubly logarithmically for large @xmath0 . in all three works ,",
    "the authors used a sequence of approximations before arriving at an expression for the fixation probability or the adaptation rate .",
    "it seems to be highly nontrivial to turn any of these approximation steps into a rigorous mathematical argument and so we do not follow their approaches here .",
    "the second approach , to consider the distribution of fitness in the population , was used in rouzine , wakeley and coffin ( @xcite ) , brunet et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and rouzine , brunet and wilke ( @xcite ) . as in the work described in the last paragraph , rouzine , wakeley and coffin ( @xcite )",
    "take fitness effects to be additive , but whereas before the selection coefficient of each new mutation was chosen from a probability distribution , now all selection coefficients are taken to be equal . in this",
    "setting , a  beneficial and a deleterious mutation carried by the same individual cancel one another out and an individual s fitness can be characterized by the _ net _ number of beneficial mutations which it carries ( which may be negative ) .",
    "writing @xmath15 for the proportion of individuals with fitness equivalent to @xmath16 beneficial mutations , @xmath17 forms a type of _ traveling wave _ whose shape remains basically unchanged over time .",
    "the position of the wave moves to the left or the right on the fitness axis , depending on whether the adaptation rate is positive or negative .",
    "this is similar to traveling waves arising from reaction  diffusion equations in the pde literature [ see , e.g. , chapter 15 of taylor ( @xcite ) ] . in the current setting , however , the shape of the wave actually fluctuates stochastically even after a long time .",
    "so the wave can be regarded as a stochastic traveling wave , and its _ speed _ is proportional to the rate of adaptation .",
    "rouzine , wakeley and coffin ( @xcite ) studied a multilocus model that does not include recombination but does include beneficial , deleterious and compensating mutations .",
    "they found that the rate of adaptation ( i.e. , the speed of the traveling wave ) asymptotically depends logarithmically on population size  @xmath0 , which is consistent with results of in vitro studies of a type of rna virus in novella et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "rouzine , brunet and wilke ( @xcite ) presents the same approach but with more detailed derivations and improved treatments of the stochastic edge .",
    "desai and fisher ( @xcite ) also adopts the traveling wave approach .",
    "their method of studying the adaptation rate , however , differs from that of rouzine , wakeley and coffin ( @xcite ) and rouzine , brunet and wilke ( @xcite ) in that they consider the fitness variation of the population to be in mutation ",
    "selection balance , and ask how much variance in fitness can the population maintain while this variation is being selected on .",
    "the conclusion they reach is that this variation ( hence the adaptation rate ) increases logarithmically with both population size and mutation rate .",
    "brunet et al .",
    "( @xcite ) study a model in which each of the @xmath0 individuals in the population gives birth to @xmath16 offspring , each of which has a fitness that differs from the fitness of its parent by a random amount and finally the @xmath0 fittest individuals are used to form the next generation .",
    "this model resembles artificial selection , rather than natural selection , but it may be easier to study because the density of individuals of a certain fitness in the next generation has a kind of _ local dependence _ on that density in the current generation .",
    "this is quite different from the behavior considered in rouzine , wakeley and coffin ( @xcite ) and our work in this article , where the density of individuals of a given fitness depends on the whole fitness distribution of the parental population .",
    "this work originally arose from discussions with nick barton and jonathan coe which focused on limits to the rate of adaptation when all mutations are beneficial . in reality , most mutations are either neutral or deleterious .",
    "in particular , if all mutations in an asexual population were deleterious , then the population would irreversibly accumulate deleterious mutations , a process known as muller s ratchet .",
    "the first mathematically rigorous analysis of muller s ratchet is due to haigh ( @xcite ) .",
    "there , a wright  fisher model is formulated that incorporates the effects of selection and mutation .",
    "again all mutations carry equal weight so that individuals can be classified according to how many mutations they carry .",
    "haigh ( @xcite ) showed that if the population size is infinite ( so that the dynamics of the model become deterministic ) then there is a stationary distribution . in the finite population case , however , this is not the case . at any given time",
    ", there is a _",
    "fittest class _ , corresponding to those individuals carrying the smallest number of mutations , but this class will eventually be lost due to genetic drift ( the randomness in the reproduction mechanism ) .",
    "this loss is permanent since there is no beneficial or back mutation to create a class fitter than the current fittest class .",
    "the next fittest class then becomes the fittest class , but that will be lost eventually as well and the entire population grows inexorably less fit .",
    "higgs and woodcock ( @xcite ) derived a set of moment equations for haigh s model but these are not closed and so are hard to analyse . instead",
    ", their results rely mainly on simulations .",
    "stephan , chao and smale ( @xcite ) and gordo and charlesworth ( @xcite ) use ( slightly different ) one - dimensional diffusions to approximate the size of the fittest class .",
    "etheridge , pfaffelhuber and wakolbinger ( @xcite ) go much further along this line ( and provide a more thorough review of the literature than that included here ) .",
    "they conjecture and provide justification for a phase transition and power law behavior in the rate of the ratchet .",
    "but in spite of the very considerable body of work on muller s ratchet , even a rigorous expression for the rate of decline in mean fitness of the population remains elusive .",
    "muller s ratchet caricatures the evolution of a population in which there is no recombination and no beneficial mutation .",
    "such a population is doomed to become progressively less and less fit .",
    "so how can a species overcome the ratchet ?",
    "if it reproduces sexually , then recombination of parental chromosomes can create offspring that are fitter than either parent and so muller s ratchet has been proposed as an explanation for the evolution of sexual reproduction [ e.g. , muller ( @xcite ) , felsenstein ( @xcite ) ] . but not all populations reproduce sexually .",
    "another mechanism which has the potential to overcome muller s ratchet is the presence of beneficial mutations , and it is this mechanism that we shall consider here .",
    "more specifically , we pose the following question : with both beneficial and deleterious mutations , does a sufficiently large population overcome muller s ratchet ?",
    "the conclusion we reach , through both nonrigorous ( section [ sec3 ] ) and rigorous ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) approaches , is the following : as long as the proportion of beneficial mutations is strictly positive , the rate of adaptation is roughly @xmath18 for large  @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is the population size and time is measured in generations .",
    "this shows that even with a tiny proportion of beneficial mutations , a large enough population size will yield a positive adaptation rate , in which case the entire population grows fitter at a high rate and muller s ratchet is overcome .",
    "it also shows , in particular , that the rate of adaptation grows without bound as @xmath14 in the all - mutations - beneficial case .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of rouzine , wakeley and coffin ( @xcite ) and wilke ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : means ] plots the adaptation rate against log population size from simulation results of the model we consider in this article .",
    "we observe that for each set of parameters @xmath19 , @xmath9 and @xmath4 , the rate of adaptation is roughly proportional to @xmath20 and small population sizes may result in negative adaptation rates .",
    "furthermore , larger @xmath19 results in a higher adaptation rate for fixed @xmath9 and @xmath4 .",
    "the upshot is that with @xmath9 and @xmath4 held constant , a smaller proportion of beneficial mutations needs a larger population size for muller s ratchet to be overcome .    in the model , we study here the selection coefficient @xmath4 is held fixed as @xmath21 .",
    "this is known as a `` strong selection '' model .",
    "our interest is in the behavior of the model for very large @xmath0 .",
    "it is not clear in this setting how to pass to an infinite population limit and so we must work with a model based on discrete individuals .",
    "an alternative model , the so - called weak selection model , is used to address behavior of very large populations when @xmath22 is not too large . by fixing @xmath22 ( as opposed to @xmath4 )",
    ", one can pass to an infinite population limit .",
    "the limiting model comprises a countably infinite system of coupled stochastic differential equations for the frequencies of individuals of different fitnesses within the population .",
    "preliminary calculations for this model are presented in yu and etheridge ( @xcite ) .     and @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "all individuals experience selection effects via a selection mechanism ( which introduces a drift reflecting the differential reproductive success based on fitness ) and the effect of genetic drift via a resampling mechanism .",

    "this model has a time scale such that one unit of time corresponds roughly to one generation .",
    "a more sophisticated model should consider mutations that have a distribution of fitness effects , for example , an independent exponentially distributed selective advantage associated with each new beneficial mutation as proposed by gillespie ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent work by hegreness et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , however , suggests that in models where beneficial mutations have a distribution of fitness advantages , evolutionary dynamics , for example , the distribution of successful mutations which ultimately determines the rate of adaptation , can be reasonably described by an equivalent model where all beneficial mutations confer the same fitness advantage .",

    "the second component above has a rigorous counterpart in proposition [ thm : mean_tail ] , but we have found it difficult to give a rigorous statement of the shape of the wave that we can prove and use , therefore our rigorous arguments in section [ sec4 ] does not rely on the first component of the nonrigorous argument .",
