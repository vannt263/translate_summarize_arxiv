    "the larger a local level @xmath58 or @xmath59 , the higher the chance to reject the null hypothesis corresponding to the @xmath52th smallest order statistic @xmath38 at least under the null hypothesis .",

    "however , we have to take into account that order statistics are dependent , see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the limiting local levels are bounded away from zero , whereas for @xmath86 we get @xmath87 .",
    "this coincides with the well - known fact that ks tests have higher power for alternatives that differ from the null distribution in the central range and low power against alternative distributions which mainly deviate from the null in the tails .",
    "alternatives of this kind , however , are common in many applications , for example , in genome - wide association studies , in which we face a very large number of hypotheses to test with only a small number of them being non - null . for more practical applications see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .    various modifications of the ks test have been proposed in the past .",
    "for example , rvsz @xcite constructed a test based on a statistic which combines the advantages of the classical and normalized ks statistics with regard to their sensitivity ranges . mason and",
    "schuenemeyer @xcite introduced a modified ks test by combining the classical ks with rnyi - type statistics and investigated the finite sample and asymptotic distribution of this modification .",
    "test statistics that are determined by order statistics , in particular tail order statistics , are studied by lockhart in @xcite with respect to asymptotic relative efficiency against a certain class of alternatives .",
    "bahadur efficiencies for a lot of non - parametric gof tests are extensively studied by nikitin in @xcite .",
    "more recently , jager and wellner @xcite proposed gof tests based on phi - divergences .",
    "their supremum- and integral - type statistics cover various forms of anderson  darling and berk  jones statistics .      for many ( non - parametric ) gof tests",
    ", there is a class of alternatives against which this test is the most powerful .",
    "hence , if we have some information about the range , where the alternative distribution mainly deviates from the null distribution , it seems worthwhile to apply such an appropriately tailored gof test .",
    "however , from the viewpoint of test statistics it is difficult to determine whether the corresponding gof test is sensitive for a predefined range of deviations .",
    "fortunately , the construction of tailored gof tests is much easier by means of local levels .",
    "thereby , the aim is to construct a gof test with larger local levels in the crucial area .",
    "for example , assuming sparse signals , a gof test with larger local levels for indices close to @xmath61 and smaller local levels for the remaining indices seems to be a reasonable choice .    in general , for a given suitable set of local levels @xmath58 , @xmath6 , we are able to construct a corresponding gof test of the form ( [ defgof ] ) and/or ( [ defgof2 ] ) . in the one - sided case",
    "the related critical values are given by @xmath88 , @xmath6 , where @xmath89 denotes the inverse function of the c.d.f .",
    "@xmath54 . for a two - sided gof test @xmath28",
    "we have to decide how to split @xmath90 into two non - negative terms @xmath91 and @xmath92 such that @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "one possibility may be @xmath96 , which leads to @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the latter can be calculated at least numerically .",
    "if we do not have any idea on alternatives , it seems natural to choose a gof test with equal local levels , that is , @xmath99 for some suitable @xmath100 .",
    "the idea behind this proposal is similar to the idea behind the ks test , where the distance between the empirical c.d.f . @xmath101 and the underlying c.d.f .",
    "@xmath102 , that is , @xmath103 for the one - sided test case and @xmath104 for the two - sided case , is compared to the same critical value for each @xmath105 .",
    "that is , the ks test can be seen as a gof test with equal distances for all feasible @xmath105-values .",
    "considering other measures of the distance between the theoretical and the corresponding empirical distributions , one may construct various gof tests with some quantities being equal .",
    "for example , a family of gof tests introduced in @xcite can be seen as tests with equal phi - divergences .",
    "a prominent example here is the berk ",
    "jones test which corresponds to equal kullback - leibler divergences .",
    "altogether , the idea of considering equal quantities such as equal distances , critical values , test statistics and also local levels , is a natural approach when constructing gof tests .",
    "gof tests with local levels equal to some @xmath100 are given as follows .",
    "the one - sided version of the test @xmath106 ( say ) is defined by ( [ defgof ] ) with @xmath107 , @xmath6 . the two - sided test @xmath108 is given by ( [ defgof2 ] ) with @xmath109 and @xmath110 , @xmath6 . in order to get a level @xmath0 test we have to choose @xmath111 such that @xmath112 and/or @xmath113 .",
    "unfortunately , it seems there does not exist any analytically manageable formula for @xmath114 as a function of @xmath62 and @xmath0 so that @xmath114 has to be calculated numerically .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to provide some bounds for @xmath111 . for example",
    ", the bonferroni inequality implies @xmath115 moreover , it can easily be seen that @xmath114 lies between the smallest and largest local levels for any ( exact ) level @xmath0 gof test of type ( [ defgof ] ) and ( [ defgof2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "thus , knowledge of local levels corresponding to suitable gof tests leads at least to upper and lower bounds for @xmath114 .",
    "for example , by means of the asymptotic ks local levels , we get for the one - sided case @xmath116 which is , unfortunately , a very wide range .",
    "thus , we have to study local levels related to other level @xmath0 gof tests .",
    "once we have @xmath114 , one may redefine the corresponding gof tests with equal local levels as minimum @xmath33-value ( minp ) tests based on the one - sided @xmath33-values @xmath117 , @xmath118 . setting @xmath119 and @xmath120 , we get @xmath121 iff @xmath122 and @xmath123 iff @xmath124 .    the minp statistics @xmath125 and @xmath126 were already introduced by berk and jones in 1979 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and they referred to these statistics as minimum level attained statistics .",
    "implicitly , berk and jones were the first proposing the construction of equal local level gof tests ( even though they did not use the term local levels ) . among others , they extensively studied @xmath127 and @xmath126 with respect to optimality and bahadur efficiency , see also @xcite .",
    "a further representation of gof tests with equal local levels was provided in the unpublished manuscript @xcite in 2006 . moreover , such tests were recently provided by several authors . at the 7th international conference on multiple comparison procedures ( mcp ) 2011 we introduced the concept of local levels and proposed gof tests with equal local levels as an improvement of the higher criticism ( hc ) tests . at the mcp 2013 we presented asymptotic as well as finite properties of gof tests with equal local levels , cf .",
    "in contrast to the formulation via local levels , the gof test in @xcite is formulated in terms of bounding functions .",
    "this representation of the test is elaborated on in @xcite .",
    "what is more , the same test is provided in @xcite in the hc framework .",
    "finally , the test is also considered in the preprints @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .      in connection with high dimensional data and associated multiple testing issues , the so - called higher criticism ( hc ) tests generated considerable interest during the last decade , cf .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , donoho and jin proposed the use of hc tests when testing the global null hypothesis in high - dimensional models with sparse signals against some specific alternatives . studying the hc test statistic they showed in @xcite that , asymptotically , hc related tests are successful throughout the same region of amplitude sparsity where the corresponding oracle likelihood ratio test would succeed .",
    "this means that a further specification of an alternative is not necessary .",
    "note that hc tests can also be seen as gof tests of the type ( [ defgof ] ) and/or ( [ defgof2 ] ) .",
    "what is more , it appears that studying local levels corresponding to hc tests is essential in order to construct new gof tests , which have a high power against alternative distributions that mainly deviate from the null distribution in the considered range .",
    "alternatively , instead of hc tests one may consider other gof tests which are based on the phi - divergences introduced in @xcite . thereby ,",
    "the family of these tests is parametrized by @xmath128 $ ] so that the hc test corresponds to @xmath129 , the berk ",
    "jones test to @xmath130 , the reversed berk  jones test to @xmath131 and the studentized version of the hc test to @xmath132 . as suggested by a referee",
    ", we compare local levels for some selected @xmath133-values .",
    "figure  [ figloclevphidiv ] shows two - sided local levels of the exact level @xmath0 tests based on the phi - divergences for @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "gof tests based on phi - divergences with @xmath137 ( from left to right ) together with @xmath138 related to the two - sided level @xmath0 test @xmath108 for @xmath81 and @xmath135 . ]",
    "what these local levels have in common is that they are large in the tails and small and approximately equal in the central range .",
    "however , the range of the local level values is largest for the hc test and smallest for the berk  jones test .",
    "therefore , it looks that the berk  jones test leads to the narrowest bounds for @xmath114 while the hc test to the widest ones . due to the fact that under the null hypothesis statistics based on phi - divergences have the same asymptotic behavior in a specific range relevant for the asymptotics , any of these tests will lead to the same asymptotic results for most local levels .",
    "therefore , it does not matter which test we consider .",
    "since the tests with @xmath129 ( hc tests ) and @xmath132 ( studentized hc tests ) have the simplest representation of the form ( [ defgof ] ) and/or ( [ defgof2 ] ) , we prefer to restrict attention to the original hc test , which has received a lot of attention during the past decade .      in this paper ,",
    "we calculate local levels of asymptotic level @xmath0 hc tests and show that these local levels converge to zero as @xmath139 , which differs drastically from the ks case , cf .",
    "figure  [ figlocallevelsks ] .",
    "this implies for local levels of any asymptotic level @xmath0 gof test of the form ( [ defgof ] ) and/or ( [ defgof2 ] ) that @xmath140 that is , there are no level @xmath0 tests for which the local levels are all asymptotically bounded away from zero .",
    "finally , by a careful study of asymptotic hc local levels we get for @xmath141 and/or @xmath142 that @xmath143 this result seems to be the most precise result concerning the asymptotics of the one- and two - sided gof tests with equal local levels . in general , there are only few other works , in which asymptotics is investigated , cf .",

    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sechc ] , we study local levels of the hc test . we further derive the critical value and rejection curves corresponding to asymptotic level  @xmath0 hc tests and provide a result on the asymptotic behavior of the hc critical values . as zones of normal and poisson convergence play a crucial role in the derivation of asymptotic results , we provide some basic results on these approximations for hc local levels in section  [ secapproximations ] .",

    "these quantities serve as an indicator of regions of high / low local sensitivity of a test and thus provide a method to compare tests with respect to areas of sensitivity .",
    "for example , the classical ks test has higher power for alternatives that differ from the null distribution in the central range .",
    "this coincides with the fact that local levels of the ks tests are considerably larger in the central range and are even equal to zero for extremes and smaller intermediates . in high - dimensional data with only sparse signals that are to be detected",
    ", it would be advisable to perform a gof test ( or related multiple tests ) which is sensitive in the tails .",
    "in such situations performing hc tests , which are asymptotically sensitive only in the moderate tails , would be an advantage . due to the fact that the number of local levels corresponding to central ranks is considerably higher than the number of local levels corresponding to intermediate ranks",

    "therefore , it is a rather striking result that central local levels are indeed asymptotically as large as the ones in the moderate tails .",
    "the reason for this may be hidden in the complex dependence structure of order statistics , so that a further investigation in this direction is needed . in general",

    "jones test comes close to the equal local levels test .",
    "it might be of interest to compare the asymptotic local levels of these tests as outlined in this paper for the hc test .",
    "an additional difficulty is that explicit critical values needed in ( [ defgof ] ) and ( [ defgof2 ] ) are hard to obtain for the berk ",

    "moreover , by means of results related to the hc tests we showed that there is no level @xmath0 gof tests with local levels asymptotically uniformly bounded away from zero . in view of the fact that most of the hc local levels are asymptotically equal and that the first hc local levels are much too large so that the remaining ones are too small in the finite case , the gof test with equal local levels @xmath381 seems to be a good alternative for the classical hc test , which is known for its extremely slow asymptotics .",
