    "multiqubit entangled states , e.g. cluster states , are key resources to realize several protocols of quantum information processing , including measurement based quantum computation @xcite , quantum communication @xcite and quantum error correction @xcite . besides , they found applications in advanced fundamental tests of quantum nonlocality @xcite .",
    "basically , there are two ways to generate multiqubit entangled states , e.g. cluster states .",
    "on one hand , one may increase the number of entangled photons @xcite . on the other hand one may use different degrees of freedom of the same pair of photons @xcite achieving so - called hyperentanglement .",
    "the second method offers a larger robustness against decoherence and nonunit detector efficiency .",
    "four and six multiphoton cluster states have been experimentally created @xcite as well as two - photon four- @xcite and six - qubit cluster states @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we suggest and demonstrate a novel scheme to generate two - photon multipartite entangled states which exploits the transverse spatial structure of spontaneous parametric downconversion and a programmable spatial light modulator ( @xmath0d slm ) based on a liquid crystal display .",
    "this kind of devices have been already used as pulse shaper for bell state generation @xcite , as amplitude modulators for momentum imaging and qudit generation @xcite as well as diffractive elements to operate on orbital angular momentum @xcite . here",
    "we employ slm in an innovative way to realize two - photon multiqubit / qudit entangled states and demonstrate its use in the generation of two - photon three - qubit linear cluster states with high fidelity .",
    "the novelty of our setup is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", we use the slm for purification , and this allows us to dramatically decrease the spectral and angular filtering of downconverted photons , which is the method generally used to prevent the degradation of the purity .",
    "moreover the slm may be externally controlled , via software , and this makes our method more easily adjustable for the different implementations , compared to purification schemes that involve the use of suitably prepared crystals along the path of the downconverted photons @xcite . on the other hand , we fully exploit the properties of the slm to realize arbitrary phase - gates between polarization and momentum degrees of freedom . in this way",
    ", we obtain an effective , low cost , source of two - photon multipartite entanglement using a pump with low power and a limited coherence time .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we describe our pdc system in some details and illustrate the purification method based on the use of slm . in section",
    "iii we address the generation of two - photon multiqubit / qudit entangled states and describe our experimental setup , used to demonstrate the generation of two - photon three - qubit linear cluster states with high fidelity .",
    "section iv closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the first step in our scheme is the generation of polarization entangled states by spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) in two adjacent bbo crystals oriented with their optical axes aligned in perpendicular planes @xcite .",
    "the state outgoing the two crystals may be written as @xmath2\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the crystals length .",
    "the complex amplitude spectrum of the pump laser is @xmath4 whereas the downconverted photons are generated with the two photons spectral and angular amplitude @xmath5 , as defined in @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath6 and @xmath7 the frequencies of the pump laser and of the signal , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the shift from the central frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "likewise signal and idler generation angles are respectively @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the central angle and @xmath15 . within the spectral width of our pump",
    "the dependence on @xmath16 is negligible and thus we have @xmath17 , with @xmath18 .    the phase term @xmath19 is due to the pump traversing the first crystal before it generates photons in the second one , whereas the term @xmath20 appears because the photons generated in the first crystal must traverse the second one .",
    "the perpendicular part @xmath21 disappears for conservation of the transverse momentum , as it is guaranteed by the large pump spot on the crystals ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the other phase terms are common and are grouped out .",
    "the phase - shifts @xmath23 and @xmath24 are introduced by a spatial light modulator ( slm ) respectively on the signal and on the idler and depend on the generation angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these will discussed in details in the following .",
    "it can be shown numerically that @xmath27 for crystals length @xmath28 . upon expanding all the contributions to the optical paths to first order and after some algebra",
    "we arrive at @xmath29 \\label{eq_phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the angular acceptance and @xmath31 are the integration limits for @xmath32 , as determined by @xmath30 and @xmath33 .",
    "the phase function between the @xmath34 and the @xmath35 component is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 includes all the zero - order terms of the expansion .",
    "the phase term @xmath38 accounts for the delay time between horizontal and vertical downconverted photons .",
    "the two subsequent terms rise for conservation of the transverse momentum . the term @xmath39 may be understood by considering the signal at the fixed angle @xmath40 : for different @xmath32 the idler sweeps different @xmath41 and this means different optical path .",
    "likewise fixing @xmath32 , a positive variation of @xmath42 correspond to a negative variation of @xmath43 and this introduces an optical path dependent on @xmath42 , i.e. the phase shift @xmath44 .",
    "the delay time between the photons may be compensated upon the introduction of a proper combination of birefringent crystals on the pump path , as already demonstrated in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ 2d_generation ] ) .",
    "let us now focus attention on the action of the slm , i.e. on the phase function @xmath23 and @xmath45 .",
    "at first , since @xmath17 we note that the choice @xmath46 with @xmath47 allows one to compensate all the remaining phase terms in @xmath48 and to achieve purification of the state . in this way",
    ", we may generate polarization entangled states as in eq .",
    "( [ eq_phi ] ) with @xmath49 .",
    "experimentally we obtain a visibility of about @xmath50 starting from @xmath51 .",
    "in order to generate multipartite entangled states , and in particular cluster states , purification is just the first step .",
    "here we suggest a new technique based on the use of the slm .",
    "we consider the signal and the idler beams divided in n and m subdivisions ( see fig .",
    "[ clg](d ) ) , which individuate different momentum qudits , and write the signal and idler momentum state as @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the total momentum state is @xmath55 .",
    "this is not an entangled state in the momentum since for a certain signal angle @xmath42 , the idler sweeps a wide interval of @xmath43 , actually covering all the angular acceptance @xmath30 due to the broad down conversion spectrum .",
    "the global state is thus given by @xmath56 , where polarization provides two qubits , and the rest of information is encoded onto the momentum degrees of freedom @xcite .    ; in ( c ) the state configuration to achieve @xmath57 ( which may become @xmath58 upon the use of a spectral filter , bandpass of @xmath59 ) . in",
    "( d ) the generic configuration leading to the momentum state @xmath60 . ]    the action of the slm corresponds to impose a phase shift only on the horizontal component of polarization , leaving the vertical part undisturbed .",
    "we exploit this property to add a different constant phase , besides the purification ones @xmath23 and @xmath45 , for each portion of signal and idler .",
    "this corresponds to the action of a set of controlled phase - gates @xmath61 , @xmath62 to the state @xmath56 .",
    "using a suitable number of sectors ( power of two ) one may generate multiqubit entangled states of the form @xmath63 .",
    "the simplest example , which we implemented experimentally , is obtained using @xmath64 and @xmath65 , i.e. by dividing the signal beams in two parts exploiting the slm to apply a phase @xmath66 to only one of them ( see fig .",
    "[ clg](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this leads to the generation of a two - photons three - qubit entangled state of the form @xmath67 $ ] where , for the first two qubits , @xmath68 and @xmath69 whereas the third qubit is the signal momentum . for @xmath70",
    "one obtains a two - photons three - qubit linear cluster state @xmath71\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 are standard bell states . in order to highlight the power of our method",
    "let us consider another example , with four qubits : for @xmath73 ( see fig . [",
    "clg](c ) ) and applying @xmath74 , @xmath75 we achieve the four - qubit entangled state @xmath76 and @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "we foresee that using a narrower spectral filter for the downconverted photons it is possible to select different regions of the angular distribution in a way that allow us to engineer entanglement also for the momentum degrees of freedom . using a @xmath78 bandpass filter and coupling @xmath79 on the momentum channels @xmath80 , for @xmath81 , we would have @xmath58 .",
    "in such a way the total state would be the two - photon four - qubit cluster state reported in @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d_generation ] .",
    "the pump derives from a @xmath82 cw laser diode ( newport lqc@xmath83p ) .",
    "after an half wave plate ( hwp ) that rotates its polarization in order to balance the generated state , the pump passes through two bbo crystals that compensate the delay time @xmath84 between @xmath85 and @xmath86 generated photons .",
    "two bbo crystals , each cut for type - i down conversion , stacked back - to - back and oriented with their optical axes aligned in perpendicular planes , are used to generate the polarization entangled state .",
    "as shown in fig . [ clg](a ) a portion of the output cones passes through the spatial light modulator ( slm ) , which is a crystal liquid phase mask ( @xmath87 ) divided in @xmath88 horizontal pixels , each wide @xmath89 and with the liquid crystal @xmath90 deep .",
    "the slm is set at a distance @xmath91 from the two generating crystals . driven by a voltage the liquid crystal orientation in correspondence of a certain pixel changes .",
    "the photons with an horizontal polarization feel an extraordinary index of refraction depending on the orientation , and this introduce a phase - shift between the two polarizations .",
    "since each pixel is driven independently we can introduce a phase function dependent on the position on the slm , i.e. on the generation angle @xmath42 and @xmath43 .     by a newport lqc@xmath83p cw laser diode .",
    "then , a spatial section of the output cones passes through the slm which ( at the same time ) i ) provides purification of polarization entanglement and ii ) introduces a position- ( i.e. generation angle ) dependent phase - shift between the two polarizations .",
    "after slm there are ( on both paths ) a slit , an iris , two longpass filters ( cut - on wavelength @xmath92 ) , a coupler with an @xmath93 output beam diameter of @xmath94 and a multimode optical fiber that directs the photons to the detector .",
    "the detectors are home - made single - photon counting modules ( @xmath95 ) , based on an avalanche photodiode operated in geiger mode with passive quenching .",
    "for tomographic reconstruction we insert a quarter - wave plate , a half - wave plate and a polarizer and for the optimization of the phase functions only the polarizers . ]",
    "it is worth noting that the slm also replaces the birefringent plate used for the optimal generation of photon pairs @xcite .",
    "after slm , on the signal and the idler paths , there are a slit , an iris , two longpass filters ( cut - on wavelength @xmath92 ) , a coupler with an @xmath93 output beam diameter of @xmath94 and a multimode optical fiber that directs the photons to the detector .",
    "the detectors are home - made single - photon counting modules ( @xmath95 ) , based on an avalanche photodiode operated in geiger mode with passive quenching . for the tomographic reconstruction we insert , on both paths after the iris , a quarter - wave plate , a half - wave plate and a polarizer .",
    "for the optimization of the phase functions ( see below ) we insert only the polarizers .",
    "our experimental setup allows us to collect the downconverted photons within a wide spectrum and angular distribution . in order to underline this fact the pump power on the crystals has been intentionally left very low ( @xmath96 ) by using an amplitude modulator . to collect as many photons as possible",
    "we make the imaging of the pump spot on the crystals ( @xmath97 ) into the optical fibers core ( diameter of @xmath98 ) using the coupler lenses . setting the slits at @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) and the iris with a diameter of @xmath101",
    "we collect up to @xmath102 coincidence couns per second .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that such an angular acceptance @xmath30 acts as a @xmath103 bandpass spectral filter for the down converted photons . in order to purify the state we insert the phase functions @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the pixel number , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the central pixels on idler and signal , i.e. the pixels corresponding to the central angles @xmath110 and @xmath111 . the values of the parameters",

    "the agreement with the theoretical model is excellent . in turn , the purification of the state works as follows : starting from a visibility equal to @xmath130 we achieve @xmath131 after the delay compensation with the crystals and @xmath132 after the spatial compensation with the slm . finally , by closing the iris at the same width of the slits we obtain @xmath133 . actually , we verified experimentally that variations of the phase in the azimuthal direction have only a minor effect .",
    "the residual lack of visibility is in turn due to the low spatial coherence of the pump , which is spatially multimode .",
    "upon properly programming the slm , i.e. by setting @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath70 as in fig .",

    "a programmable spatial light modulator acts on different spatial sections of the overall downconversion output and provides polarization entanglement purification as well as arbitrary phase - gates between polarization and momentum qubits .",
    "it should be mentioned that also measurements on the momentum qubits benefits from our configuration .",
    "in fact , addressing momentum is equivalent to select portions of the signal ( idler ) beam and then make them interacting , say by a beam splitter and other linear optical elements , to perform arbitrary momentum measurements . in our scheme",
    "this may be implemented in a compact form since the portions of the beam are quite close each other , and we may work with beam splitter at non normal incidence .",
    "overall , our scheme represents an effective , low cost , source of two - photon multiqubit / qudit entanglement .",
    "we foresee applications in one - way quantum computation and quantum error correction .",
