    "given a maniplex , its symmetry type graph encapsulates all the information of the local configuration of the flag orbits under the action of the automorphism group of the maniplex .",
    "traditionally , the main focus of the study of maps and polytopes has been that of their symmetries .",
    "regular and chiral ones have been extensively studied .",
    "these are maps and polytopes with either maximum degree of symmetry or maximum degree of symmetry by rotation .",
    "edge - transitive maps were studied in @xcite by siran , tucker and watkins .",
