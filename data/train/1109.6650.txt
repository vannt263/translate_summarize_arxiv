    "three dimensional ( 3d ) topological band insulator ( ti ) bi@xmath0x@xmath1 ( x = se , te ) and its ternary counterparts have attracted considerable attention from the condensed matter physics community because of the relatively simple crystal structure that hosts novel surface states@xcite . and their unusual responses to external fields .",
    "many more 3d ti materials have been predicted@xcite by now , and quest for studying their novel surface state properties , in isolation as well as in presence of other materials , has increased in recent years .",
    "the 3d ti surface states are time - reversal symmetric ( trs ) at high - symmetry points in the momentum space and are therefore protected against perturbations which can not break trs such as non - magnetic impurities or adatoms .",
    "such novel properties have caused excitement in the electron device community as well because it can be a potential alternative to graphene as a channel material in field effect transistors .",
    "the advances in understanding of structural , electronic , magnetic and transport properties of 3d ti , made possible by both experimental and theoretical studies@xcite , can provide important informations for novel applications . beside the fundamental studies of these model 3d ti materials ,",
    "theoretically , no studies of dielectric effects on the surface states have been performed so far from first principles .",
    "we address dielectric effects on the ti surface states using _ ab - initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) and semi - local density approximation@xcite .",
    "two crystalline dielectrics were considered : quartz ( sio@xmath0 ) and boron nitride ( bn ) . both binary ti bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and ternary tis bi@xmath0se@xmath0te and bi@xmath0te@xmath0se",
    "were considered for this study .",
    "our studies suggest that neither of the two dielectrics has an effect on the dirac cone except the oxygen - terminated quartz . under the environment of oxygen dangling bond ,",
    "the dirac cone on the ti surface is buried inside the quartz valence band continuum with the oxygen dangling bond states occupying the region around the fermi level .",
    "surface passivation by atomic hydrogen pushes the dangling bond states from the fermi surface region down below fermi level and a clear dirac cone emerges at the fermi level .",
    "these findings are consistent with recent experimental studies of surface degradation effects in the presence of oxygen@xcite .",
    "we begin by describing the thin film structures of both binary and ternary tis , built from their bulk hexagonal structures , and the computational method in section ii . in section iii , we present the dielectric capping effects , by bn and sio@xmath0 , on their metallic surface states . both _",
    "symmetric _ and _ asymmetric _ cappings are explored .",
    "finally we present our summary and conclusions .",
    "the thin film structures for both binary and ternary tis are constructed by stacking up several quintuple layers ( or qls : 1ql=5 atomic layers ) along the crystallographic _",
    "z_-direction with a vacuum region of 3 nm which forms the supercell in the dft calculation .",
    "the first principle calculations were performed using the openmx code@xcite , based on a linear combination of pseudoatomic orbital ( pao ) method@xcite .",
    "the pseudopotentials were generated from full relativistic calculations , and the generalized gradient approximation@xcite was applied for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the kinetic energy cut - off of 180 rydberg and the * k*-point mesh of 7 @xmath2 7 @xmath2 1 for brillouin zone ( bz ) integration ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) were used .",
    "the basis sets were carefully chosen to reproduce previous bulk and thin film calculations .",
    "the cut - off , * k*-point mesh and vacuum region were optimized to guarantee the convergence of the results and their agreement with previous theoretical calculations .    for the binary ti , previous theoretical studies of bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1 found the computed lattice parameters close to the experimental values@xcite , so we used the experimental lattice parameters _",
    "a_=0.41388 nm and _ c_=2.8633 nm in the hexagonal unit cell and optimized bulk atomic positions to build the thin film structure . for the ternary ti bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ) , we built thin film structures with the bulk hexagonal unit cell lattice parameters _",
    "a_=0.422 nm ( 0.428 nm ) and _ c_=2.92 nm ( 2.99 nm ) in the previous theoretical calculation@xcite , and optimized the thin film structure by letting atoms move along _ z_-direction .",
    "we optimized thin film structures only for ternary tis , since atomic relaxations significantly affect the band structure of thin film bi@xmath0se@xmath0te around the dirac point@xcite .",
    "we considered the thin film of 6qls and 4qls for binary and ternary tis , respectively , since previous studies on binary@xcite and ternary@xcite tis suggest that 6qls and 4qls are the minimum thicknesses to maintain the gapless surface state at the dirac point .",
    "we also obtained the same critical thickness values by our own calculations . in the calculated band structure of 6qls bi@xmath0se@xmath1",
    ", we could observe the dirac cone within a bulk gap of 0.262 ev .",
    "for the ternary tis bi@xmath0se@xmath0te and bi@xmath0te@xmath0se , dirac cone surface states reside inside the bulk gap of 0.204 ev and 0.325 ev , respectively .",
    "we chose crystalline sio@xmath0 in order to assess the effect of oxygen environment on the ti surface states .",
    "the choice of bn dielectrics is perhaps guided by the recent graphene transport experiments using crystalline dielectrics@xcite .",
    "we considered both _",
    "symmetric _ and _ asymmetric _ cappings in terms of relative orientations of ti and dielectric surface atoms .",
    "_ asymmetry _ in terms of different dielectrics on two opposite ti surfaces was not considered .",
    "the bulk structures of both dielectrics were studied with the computational parameters described in the previous section . for the hexagonal bn , the experimental lattice paramters",
    "are : _ a_=0.2494 nm and _ c_=0.666 nm with the distance between b and n d@xmath3=0.144 nm@xcite , and the band gap is 5.97 ev@xcite .",
    "we used the experimental values of lattice constants and atomic positions . with these experimental values ,",
    "our calculated bulk band gap value is 5.5 ev close to the experimental value 5.97 ev .",
    "the hexagonal crystal structure of quartz contains fourfold coordinated oxygens , forming a layered structure with si with the experimental lattice parameters ( _ a_=0.4914 nm and _ c_=0.5408",
    "nm@xcite ) .",
    "our dft calculations of optimized lattice paramters with semi - local potentials are found to be close to these experimental values , accurate to within 0.1@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we chose experimental lattice parameters for building our interface structures of ti and quartz .",
    "the bulk quartz sio@xmath0 has a direct band gap of 9 ev@xcite , and our dft calculation of crystalline sio@xmath0 results in a band gap value of 9.4 ev .",
    "we note that our results obtained for quartz should be considered at best qualitative with regard to tis capped with amorphous sio2 .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the thin film of binary ti bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "the interface structures are built by putting the dielectric material on the surfaces of 6qls of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 film stacked along the _ z_-direction ( since it has no band gap for the surface states ) . in constructing supercells , we maintained the ti lattice and strained the dielectrics to fit with the ti surface resulting in the compressive or tensile strain on the dielectrics to focus on their effects on the ti electronic structure .",
    "for the bn , our analysis suggests that to keep our computational burden in dft - based calculations minimal , 3d@xmath3@xmath23d@xmath3 lattice structure can be matched in - plane with 1@xmath21 bi@xmath0se@xmath1 cell ( fig.2 and fig.3 ) or any multiples of this combination which maintains 3:1 matching ratio resulting in the 4.19@xmath4 compressive strain on bn ( in table i ) .",
    "other combinations to allow less strain result in either difficulty in forming the periodic structure or larger supercells with orders of magnitude more atoms . along the stacking direction , 6qls of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ( @xmath56 nm ) is put on six atomic layers of bn ( @xmath51.7 nm ) .",
    "the choice of 6 bn layers is somewhat arbitrary and guided by the fact that the size of vacuum and bn layers should be thick enough to avoid interactions of periodically repeated bi@xmath0se@xmath1 surface layers .",
    "we also relaxed the interfacial atoms to assess its effects . for the sio@xmath0 dielectric ,",
    "the supercell structure consists of two unit cells of sio@xmath0 sandwiching 6qls bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "the size of sio@xmath0 and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 cell along _",
    "x_-_y _ direction chosen is , respectively , 1@xmath21 and 2@xmath22 ( fig .",
    "4 ) to minimize the computational cost .",
    "this produces about 2.75@xmath4 compressive strain on both sides of sio@xmath0 as in table i. consideration of larger sizes can lead to the lower strain , but the total number of atoms in the cell increases at least an order of magnitude ( 250 versus 2500 ) .    we considered four configurations of se positions on the ti surfaces with respect to boron and nitrogen positions on the bn layer : se on the top of b , on the top of n , on the hexagonal hole and on the bond between b and n atoms .",
    "two surface terminations , si and oxygen , of quartz were considered .",
    "our calculations suggests that all bn configurations are energetically close and provide quite similar band structures .",
    "therefore , we had a choice in the selection of a particular configuration for further studies .",
    "we chose the case of b or n on the top of se on both ti surfaces .",
    "we refer the structure of b or n on the top of se on both sides of ti film as _ symmetric _ capping ( fig .",
    "the structures of b on the top of se on one side and n on the top of se on the other side of ti film , or only b or n on one side of ti film and vacuum on the other side , are referred as _",
    "asymmetric _ capping ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for quartz , both ti surfaces",
    "capped with either oxygen - terminated or si - terminated quartz were considered . because quartz is a fourfold coordinated structure , both of the surface terminations of quartz possess dangling bonds .",
    "therefore , for quartz we also considered the dangling bond saturation with hydrogen , that is , hydrogen passivation of the quartz surfaces .",
    "to set the optimal distance between the bn and bi@xmath0se@xmath1 layers at the interface , we performed the total energy calculations at the chosen set of interfacial distances .",
    "our studies suggest an optimal distance of 0.3 nm for the case of the se layer in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 on the top of either b or n in bn . for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 on quartz , the interfacial distances for si and oxygen quartz terminations with and without hydrogen passivation",
    "need to be considered .",
    "our studies suggest an optimal distance of 0.3 nm for si - terminated surface , regardless of whether dangling bonds are saturated or not . for the oxygen - terminated quartz with hydrogen passivation",
    ", we found the optimal distance to be 0.25 nm . we considered these optimal interfacial distances in our further studies .",
    "we considered the atomic relaxation in the interfacial region in order to check its effect on the electronic structure of ti surface states .",
    "two cases were considered : first is the case of se on the top of b atom on both sides of ti with the initial optimal separation of 0.3 nm . we let atoms close to the interface ( bi / se atoms in the top and bottom qls and b / n atoms in the two layers next to ti surfaces ) move in the _ z_-direction .",
    "the second choice is that the oxygen - terminated quartz with the saturation of dangling bonds is put on both ti surfaces with optimal separation of 0.25 nm .",
    "bi / se atoms in the top and bottom qls as well as si / o atoms next to the ti surfaces are allowed to move in the _ z_-direction , while hydrogen atoms used to saturate dangling bonds are relaxed in all directions .",
    ".hexagonal unit cell lattice constant _ a _ of binary ti and strains on dielectrics by the lattice mismatch at the interface [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the bn dielectric capping , the bn of 3d@xmath3@xmath23d@xmath3 lattice structure is matched in - plane with the 1@xmath21 bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ) cell .",
    "since we keep the lattice constant of bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ) and fit bn into it , bn is under about 0.23@xmath4 compressive strain ( 0.92@xmath4 compressive strain ) in table ii .",
    "six layers of bn ( @xmath51.7 nm ) is put on each side of 4qls bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ) .",
    "for the sio@xmath0 dielectric , the 1@xmath21 sio@xmath0 cell is fit with the 2@xmath22 bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ) cell in - plain , which results in 0.83@xmath4 compressive strain ( 0.57@xmath4 tensile strain ) on sio@xmath0 as summarized in table ii .",
    "two unit cells of sio@xmath0 is stacked on both sides of 4qls bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ) in the _ z_-direction .",
    "four configurations of se ( te ) positions on the ti surfaces with respect to b and n positions on the bn layer were investigated and found to be energetically quite similar , same as our studies on the binary ti with bn . the optimal distance between bn and bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ) , minimizing the total energy , is found to be 0.32 nm ( 0.3 nm ) .",
    "we considered _ asymmetric _ capping , b on the top of se ( te ) on one side and vacuum on the other side or b on the top of se ( te ) on one side and n on the top of se ( te ) on the other side , as well as _",
    "symmetric _ capping , b on the top of se ( te ) on both sides . for the sio@xmath0 capping , we focused on the oxygen - terminated sio@xmath0 on both sides of ti without saturating oxygen dangling bond states as a critical case because there are reports , as discussed in the previous section , that oxygen dangling bond states may play a crucial role in modifying ti surface .",
    "only bi@xmath0te@xmath0se with oxygen - terminated quartz was studied because we know that se orbitals lie close in energy with the oxygen orbitals from the previous study of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and the ternary ti bi@xmath0se@xmath0te is structurally similar to the binary ti bi@xmath0se@xmath1 regarding the atom species se of top and bottom surfaces .",
    "atomic relaxation was not considered for ternary tis because the rearrangement of atomic positions was found to have no substantial effect in the binary ti with dielectrics .",
    "computed band structures of bi@xmath0se@xmath0te / bn supercell are seen in fig . 13",
    "asymmetric _ capping , in fig .",
    "13(a ) ( b on the top of se on one side and vacuum on the other side ) and fig .",
    "13(b ) ( b on the top of se on one side and n on the top of se on the other side ) , and _ symmetric _ capping in fig .",
    "13(c ) ( b on the top of se on both sides ) indicate that the dirac point and the surface state dispersion are preserved .",
    "however , small splitting between top and bottom surface bands occurs in the _ asymmetric _ case , which are induced by different environments on opposite surfaces , while no such splitting exists in the _ symmetric _ structure .",
    "the valence band maximum is about 0.25 ev below for all three cases as we can estimate from the band structure of only bn slab in the inset of fig .",
    "13(a ) and atom - projected dos plots ( figures not shown ) . the bulk band gap sizes ( around 0.251 ev ) in all bn cappings for bi@xmath0se@xmath0te increases a little bit as compared with the bulk gap ( 0.204 ev ) of only 4qls bi@xmath0se@xmath0te .",
    "14 shows band structures of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se / bn supercell . in fig .",
    "14(a ) , the _ asymmetric _ capping of b on the top of te on one side and vacuum on the other side , the fourfold degeneracy at the dirac point is maintained , but two opposite surface bands seem to split .",
    "another _ asymmetric _ capping that te is on the top of b on one side and n on the other side leads to the split of fourfoud degeneracy into two twofold degeneracies at the @xmath6-point .",
    "the twofold degeneracy on each surface band still remains due to kramer s theorem which requires that the twofold degeneracy at the time - reversal invariant momenta points is protected in the absence of time - reversal symmetry breaking perturbations . on the other hands , in the _ symmetric _ structure of b on the top of te on both sides , surface bands on both sides",
    "are perfectly aligned as seen in fig .",
    "14(c ) . in bn cappings of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se , the bulk band gap sizes ( around 0.33 ev )",
    "are a bit larger than 0.325 ev the bulk band gap of 4qls bi@xmath0te@xmath0se without bn .    for the capping bi@xmath0te@xmath0se with the oxygen - terminated quartz without dangling bond passivation ,",
    "the dirac cone surface states are highly influenced by the oxygen dangling bond states in fig .",
    "15(a ) . from the dos plot in fig .",
    "15(b ) , bi , te and se orbitals are overlapped with oxygen orbitals near the dirac point .",
    "the dirac point indicated in the inset in fig .",
    "15(b ) is within the valence bands of quartz .",
    "the dos values for bi , se and te at the dirac point are not zero as shown in the inset because the dirac point is already buried under the bulk valence band maximum of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se@xcite . similarly with bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , oxygen dangling states modify dirac cone surface states without breaking the dirac point .",
    "we use a density functional based electronic structure method and atom - projected dos to study the perturbations from dielectric cappings to the dirac cone surface states of bi - based binary and ternary tis .",
    "two crystalline dielectrics bn and quartz were considered with both _",
    "symmetric _ and _ asymmetric _ cappings .",
    "our study suggests that oxygen coverage substantially affects the dirac cone , consistent with a recent experimental study .",
    "all other surface dielectric terminations have no significant effect on the ti surface states .",
