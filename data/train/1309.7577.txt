    "graphene , a two - dimensional layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , is in a focus of many surface science researchers since its fascinating transport properties were demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "these experiments renewed the interest to a graphene layer ( or monolayer of graphite in a former time ) on transition metal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "this area of the surface science can be traced back in the middle of 60s when the spectroscopic studies of the catalytic properties of transition metal surfaces were started . at that time the carbon layer segregated at high temperature at the surface of the transition metals",
    "was considered as a poison inert layer which blocks any catalytic activity . however , at the present time , a growth of graphene on metals , via segregation from the metal bulk or decomposition of hydrocarbons at the transition metal surface , are considered as the most prominent methods for the preparation of large ( up to several tens of inches ) high - quality graphene sheets  @xcite .",
    "further , these graphene layers can be transferred on the insulating or polymer support and then scaled down for the preparation of tiny high - speed transistors , gas sensors , touch screens , etc  @xcite .    from the other ,",
    "more fundamental point of view , the interaction at the graphene / metal interface is interesting problem by itself  @xcite . here",
    "one can point out the importance of this topic as the resistance of the graphene / metal contact in any electron- or spin - transport devices will be determined by the structural as well as electronic properties of such interface . with this respect",
    "it is worth to mention that the full understanding of the bonding mechanism and the corresponding electronic properties of the graphene / metal interface is far from the full understanding  @xcite .",
    "as is widely accepted now , the graphene / metal systems can be subdivided on two big classes of the `` strongly '' and `` weakly '' bonded graphene on the metallic surface . here , for the `` strongly '' bonded graphene layer [ e.g. , graphene / ni , graphene / co , graphene / rh ] the significant modification of the graphene - derived electronic states",
    "is observed and the dirac cone is not preserved in such systems , opposite to the case of the `` weakly '' bonded graphene on metals [ e.g. , graphene / cu , graphene / ir , graphene / pt , graphene / au ] .",
    "such situations are found for both lattice - matched ( graphene/@xmath0-metal interfaces ) and lattice - mismatched systems ( graphene/@xmath1-metal and graphene/@xmath2-metal interfaces ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the later systems are proposed to be used as templates for the preparation of ordered arrays of well - defined metal clusters , which can be used in future storage and catalytic applications .",
    "presently , for the investigation of the electronic structure of the graphene / metal interfaces , the spectroscopic methods are widely used : photoelectron spectroscopy , pes , gives and information about doping level of a graphene layer in the system ( x - ray pes , xps ) or about the behaviour of the graphene - derived states in the valence band ( angle - resolved pes , arpes )  @xcite and raman spectroscopy gives an information about doping level as well as about the defect concentration in the graphene layer  @xcite .",
    "these methods have limited space resolution and are not sensitive to the variation of the electronic structure of graphene on the nm - scale .",
    "however , the local information about electronic structure of graphene on the scale of the moir structure or atomic scale can be obtained only via application of the scanning probe methods [ scanning tunnelling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) and/or non - contact atomic force microscopy ( nc - afm ) ] .",
    "the recently developed 3d non - contact atomic force microscopy ( 3d nc - afm ) with conductive scanning tip  @xcite and kelvin - probe force microscopy ( kpfm ) methods with atomic scale resolution  @xcite can give such information combining the structural and electronic structure information on the sub - nm scale .",
    "such attempts were recently undertaken for graphene / rh(111 )  @xcite , graphene / ir(111 )  @xcite , and bn / rh(111 )  @xcite ( bn is an isostructural to graphene single layer consisting of b and n atoms ) , where the combination of scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy was used .",
    "these studies demonstrate the selective interaction between the different sites of the moir structure and the scanning tip and the inversion of the imaging contrast of the moir structure as well as the similar effects on the atomic scale as a function of the distance between sample and the tip ( metallic and co - terminated tips were used ) .",
    "however , the more comprehensive studies are still required .",
    "this manuscript presents the complex study of the graphene moir structure on ir(111 ) .",
    "we combine stm , 3d nc - afm , and kpfm methods in order to get information about local structural and electronic properties of the graphene / metal system on the nm- and atomic scale .",
    "the simultaneous application of these methods allows to get the spatial distribution of the tunnelling current as well as of the interaction forces between sample and the scanning tip .",
    "our results demonstrate the clear variation of the imaging contrast during scanning probe measurements as a function of the distance between sample and scanning tip as well as a bias voltage , that allows to separate between topographic and electronic contributions in all imaging modes ( stm and nc - afm ) .",
