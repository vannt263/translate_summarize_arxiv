    "we should cite a lot more papers here .",
    "those of a great impact for our work are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a problem that is closely related to the removal of a point subset or a line subset or both is reconstruction of the ambient space from the remainder .",
    "this is addressed in @xcite for projective spaces and for grassmann spaces , while @xcite deals with the segre product of grassmann spaces .",
    "the main part of the paper starts with the characterization of hyperplanes in the segre product @xmath0 of partial linear spaces ( theorem [ thm : hip : inprod ] ) .",
    "these are similar to structures investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "generalized projective geometries introduced in @xcite are products of two geometries , such that some distinguished subsets of this product have the structure of an affine space . in the case of projective spaces",
    "these subsets are directly affine spaces that emerge as hyperplane complements .",
    "likewise , we are interested in locally affine structures obtained as a hyperplane complement @xmath1 , the result of affinization . in this context issues typical to affine geometry with parallelism arise .",
    "our goal is to solve some of them .",
    "the automorphism group of @xmath1 is characterized ( theorem [ thm : auty : prod ] ) .",

    "one of the exceptions could be spine spaces with affine lines only ( cf .",

    "the next problem concerns the existence of a hyperplane @xmath3 in @xmath0 such that the complement @xmath1 is not isomorphic to the segre product of the related hyperplane complements taken in the components of @xmath0 .",
    "those isomorphic to such products are relatively easy to find ( cf . proposition [ prop : isomorph ] ) . in any case , under assumption that @xmath0 is the product of veblenian gamma spaces with lines thick enough the complement @xmath1 is covered by affine spaces ( fact [ fact : covering ] ) .    in the last section we focus on the segre product @xmath0 which components are embeddable into projective space . for such @xmath0",
    "we introduce a general construction of a hyperplane , which idea is based on the characterisation of hyperplanes in grassmann spaces provided in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
