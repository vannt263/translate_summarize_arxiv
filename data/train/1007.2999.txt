    "experimental conditions at the proposed international linear collider  @xcite ( ilc ) provide an ideal environment for the precision studies of higgs production own to the unparalleled cleanliness and well - defined initial conditions .",
    "we can use the higgs - strahlung process ( @xmath11 ) , which is a major higgs production mechanism at the ilc , to precisely measure the higgs mass ( @xmath12 ) independent of its decay modes , using the mass recoiling to the @xmath13 boson , with @xmath14 or @xmath15 . the major advantage of this recoil mass method is we do not need any information about how the higgs decays . to calculate the @xmath12 , we only need the @xmath13 boson reconstructed from the lepton pair it decays with the precisely known center of mass energy ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we can also precisely determine the higgs - strahlung cross - section ( @xmath17 ) and therefore the coupling strength at the @xmath18 vertex , without any bias from the higgs decay assumptions .",
    "this proceeding summarizes the higgs recoil mass and higgs - strahlung cross - section study done for the letter of intent  @xcite ( loi ) of the international large detector  @xcite ( ild ) concept .",
    "it is a most realistic full simulation study up to now based on the ilc design issued in the ilc reference design report  @xcite ( rdr ) and the ild detector concept .",
    "thus , it has contemplated all the major effects we have thought of from both the accelerator and the detector .",
    "it assumes @xmath19 , the ilc works at @xmath1 , and an integrated luminosity of @xmath10 ( equivalent to four years of data taking ) .",
    "the study also assumes two options of beam longitudinal polarization , @xmath20 : @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 , to quantitatively estimate the benefits from the beam polarization .",
    "the results of this study are published in the ild loi , with an accompany physics note  @xcite summarizing the methods . for the complete documentation of this study",
    ", please refer to my ph.d thesis  @xcite .",
    "the event generation is centrally done at slac  @xcite using whizard  @xcite v1.40 , based on a detailed beam simulation using guinea - pig  @xcite with beam parameters given in ilc rdr , in which the beam energy spread are 0.28% and 0.18% for electron and positron beams , respectively .",
    "both the initial - state radiation ( isr ) and final - state radiation ( fsr ) are included in the event generation .",
    "the full simulation of the ild detector and the reconstruction are done at desy and kek using software package ilcsoft  @xcite v01 - 06 .",
    "table  [ tab : xsec ] give the cross - sections of signal and major backgrounds considered in this study .",
    "we categorize the backgrounds according to the final states .",
    "for instance , the @xmath24 background consists of @xmath25 , the @xmath26 background is mostly the @xmath27 , but also @xmath28 , while the @xmath29 background comes from all the possible intermediate states @xmath30 .",
    ".cross - sections with the two options of beam polarization @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "the signal is indicated by bold face letters . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the results in table  [ tab : result ] shows the best results of a single leptonic channel come from @xmath31 . even including the bremsstrahlung recovery",
    ", the @xmath32 channel gives worse results than the @xmath33 channel by a factor of two in the @xmath12 measurement , and by a factor of 1.5 in the @xmath17 measurement .",
    "this is because of the worse energy resolution of the soft photon measurement by the ecal , and larger backgrounds related to @xmath32 channel .",
    "the results with beam polarization @xmath20 are better than those of the @xmath22 by about 10  % .",
    "the reasons are that , although the polarization @xmath22 suppresses the @xmath34 background , the cross sections of the higgs - strahlung process are smaller by about 20  % compared to that of the polarization @xmath20 . at the same time , the methods we have developed are efficient enough for the suppression of the @xmath34 background .",
    "hence the polarization @xmath20 gives better results .",
    "we may also conclude that there are two accelerator effects , the beam energy spread and the beamstrahlung , have great impact on higgs recoil mass measurement .",
    "the beam energy spread increases the width of the recoil mass peak , thus reduces the accuracy of the mass measurement .",
    "the beamstrahlung largely reduces the effective statistics on the recoil mass peak .     channel ( left ) and @xmath32 channel ( right ) , comparison of those before and after detector simulation.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] channel ( left ) and @xmath32 channel ( right ) , comparison of those before and after detector simulation.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure  [ fig : mh_gen_sim ] compares the higgs recoil mass distributions before ( generator level ) and after ( reconstructed ) full detector simulation and reconstruction for @xmath33 channel ( left ) and @xmath32 channel ( right ) .",
    "the distribution in the generator level has the accelerator effects imposed , while that after reconstruction has the detector effects added .    for the recoil mass distributions of @xmath33-channel , a fit to the left side of the maximum using a gaussian function gives the mass resolutions to be 560 mev in the generator level , and 650 mev after full detector simulation .",
    "the detector response leads to a broadening of the recoil mass maximum from 560 mev to 650 mev .",
    "the contribution from the uncertainty of detector response is therefore estimated to be 330 mev .",
    "this observation indicates that _ the dominant contribution to the observed width of the @xmath33 recoil mass distribution arises from the incoming beams rather than the response of the ild detector_.",
    "all what we have intensively studied in the past is how to reduce the statistical errors on these two measurements .",
    "a serious study of the systematic errors is apparently missing in the context .    in the higgs",
    "recoil mass measurement , the systematic biases appear as the difference between the measured value and the true value .",
    "observables correlated with the higgs recoil mass are the center of mass energy and the momenta of the pair of leptons .",
    "imperfect knowledge of these variables could introduce systematic bias to the higgs recoil mass measurement . to control them , a well studied reference reaction is needed .     in the @xmath35 process",
    "using _ kernel estimation _",
    ", with polarization mode @xmath20 .",
    "an accuracy of 13  mev is obtained for the invariant mass measurement , and 28  mev for the recoil mass measurement . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] in the @xmath35 process using _ kernel estimation _ , with polarization mode @xmath20 .",
    "an accuracy of 13  mev is obtained for the invariant mass measurement , and 28  mev for the recoil mass measurement . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the @xmath35 process is an excellent choice , with the @xmath36 precisely known to a precision of 2  mev  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 process has a similar scenario as the higgs - strahlung process with one @xmath13 boson decays to a pair of muons or electrons , and the recoil mass of the higgs replaced by that of the other @xmath13 boson .    by measurement of the invariant mass of the @xmath37",
    ", the tracking momentum measurement can be calibrated . at @xmath38  gev , assuming @xmath39  gev , the @xmath40 has about 40 times larger cross section than that of the @xmath41 . with this much larger statistics",
    "the @xmath13 mass can be measured to a precision of 13 mev , using channel @xmath42 , see figure  [ fig : fit_zz ]  ( left ) for the fit .",
    "the @xmath13 recoil mass of the @xmath35 process can be used to determine and control the center of mass energy and the radiative effects .",
    "the z recoil mass could be determined to a statistical precision of 28 mev , using channel @xmath42 , see the fit in figure  [ fig : fit_zz ]  ( right ) . with this small statistical error , the knowledge of the center of mass energy and",
    "the radiative effects could be validated precisely .    on the cross - section measurement ,",
    "the major systematic error comes from the uncertainty of the efficiency .",
    "the procedure to measure the uncertainty of the efficiency is to vary the physics assumptions together with the various background rejection methods to estimate the dependences and covariances between them .",
    "reminding we applied a very complicated background rejection method .",
    "the complicated background rejection mandatorily introduces more difficulties in the measurement of the uncertainty of the efficiency .    for the cross section measurement",
    ", we found that the statistical error does not request such a high suppression of the background as for the mass measurement . by removing the likelihood method and remaining only cuts on some basic variables @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 balance ,",
    "the statistical error on the cross section measurement only increases by about 10  % on average .",
    "this means a similar statistical error could be obtained with much less sources of systematic error due to the background rejection methods ."
