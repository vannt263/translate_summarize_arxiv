    "uniform morphisms have particularly nice properties .",
    "for example , the class of words generated by iterating @xmath24-uniform morphisms coincides with the class of @xmath24-automatic sequences , generated by finite automata .    dekking s construction used a non - uniform morphism . in this paper",
