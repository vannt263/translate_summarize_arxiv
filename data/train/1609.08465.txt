    "about 50% of pre  main sequence ( pms ) stars in t  associations have been found to be in binary systems ( duchne & kraus 2013 ) .",
    "therefore , a large number of pms stars evolve through accretion from circumbinary discs , and those discs are also the birthplace of planets .",
    "discs around pms binary systems were first detected at the same time as discs around single stars in the late 1980s and 1990s through the excess emission in the infrared and at submillimetric wavelengths ( bertout , basri & bouvier  1988 ) .",
    "the first circumbinary disc to be imaged , using interferometry and then adaptive optics , was that around gg  tau ( dutrey , guilloteau & simon  1994 , roddier et al .",
    "1996 ) . in 1997",
    ", jensen & mathieu reported a deficit of near  infrared emission from a few short  period pms binaries , confirming the theoretical prediction that binaries clear up a cavity in their circumbinary disc ( lin & papaloizou 1979 ) . recently",
    ", several circumbinary discs have been imaged with alma ( czekala et al .",
    "2015 , 2016 ) , and it is believed that alma may be able to detect structures in circumbinary discs produced by the tidal potential of the binary ( ruge et a. 2015 ) .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that the cavity cleared up by the binary does not prevent accretion onto the stars ( artymowicz & lubow  1996 ) , as gas spirals in along streams .",
    "those streams connect to circumstellar discs that ultimately are accreted onto the stars .",
    "such circumstellar discs in binary systems have been imaged using adaptive optics ( mayama et al .",
    "2010 ) and gas in the cavity of the disc around gg  tau has been imaged with alma ( dutrey et al .",
    "2014 ) .    because of the presence of streams and circumstellar discs in the cavity being fed by the circumbinary disc , pms binaries are complex systems .",
    "emission from such systems is indeed observed to have contribution from various sources and to often be variable , but it is not always understood what produces the emission and the variability ( messina et al . 2016 , ardila et al . 2015 , gillen et al . 2014 , bary & petersen  2014 , boden et al . 2009 , jensen et al . 2007 ) .",
    "here we investigate a new source of ( variable ) emission , namely energy emission from the inner edge of the cavity .",
    "although the clearing of a cavity by the binary has been extensively studied , the physical conditions in the region of the cavity edge have yet to be elucidated . here",
    "we show that the action of the gravitational torque from the binary , which truncates the disc and produces the cavity , is accompanied by energy dissipation at the disc s inner edge .",
    "this energy dissipation , for the most part , comes from shocks produced by fluid elements which are ultimately accreted by the binary , and that suffer some oscillations in their distance to the centre of mass of the binary resulting in them impacting the disc s inner edge on their way in .",
    "in addition , the edge of the cavity may behave as a hard wall which absorbs the radiation from the stars and re  emits it at longer wavelength .",
    "these two sources of energy produce an excess of emission which is in the mid ",
    "infrared for spectroscopic binaries .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : hydro_sim ]",
    ", we present hydrodynamic simulations of a disc orbiting around a binary system .",
    "we calculate the rate of energy dissipation associated with shocks which are found to be highly localised at the inner edge of the disc . as already noted by previous authors , we find that the rate of accretion onto the binary tends to be suppressed , compared to what would be expected from the value of the surface density just beyond the cavity edge in the absence of the binary , when the disc s aspect ratio decreases below 0.05 or so .",
    "however , the energy dissipation at the disc s inner edge is not affected by this suppression . in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we develop an analysis to elucidate the origin of this energy dissipation . we show that it is associated with the tidal torque which maintains the cavity : angular momentum is transferred from the binary to the disc through the action of compressional shocks and viscous friction .",
    "the rate of energy dissipation is given by the binary angular velocity times the torque exerted by the binary , and does not directly depend on the actual accretion rate onto the binary . in section  [ sec : particle_sim ] , we present particle simulations to illustrate the dynamics near the disc s inner edge in more detail and the accretion flow onto the binary .",
    "these simulations show that , before being accreted , particles are in general accelerated onto a trajectory that sends them back towards the circumbinary disc .",
    "shocks that result at the disc s inner edge together with the action of viscous friction circularize the orbits of the particles and dissipate energy .",
    "we find that the energy released during one collision of a unit mass particle with the disc s inner edge is on the order of the potential energy per unit mass there , leading to agreement with the results of the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "when accretion onto the binary is reduced , the particles which end up being accreted undergo more collisions , such that the resulting total energy dissipation rate stays the same . in section  [ sec : sed ] , we calculate the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a circumbinary disc taking into account the energy dissipated at the inner edge and also irradiation of the inner edge by the stars .",
    "we show that , for tight binaries having a separation @xmath1  r@xmath2 , emission from the edge completely dominates the sed in the mid  infrared ( from 14 to 10  @xmath0 m ) . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "we conclude that the processes presented in this paper may help to explain the excess of emission in the mid  infrared observed in some pms binary systems , like corot  223992193 ( gillen et al .",
    "2014 ) and v1481  ori ( messina et al .",
    "we have performed two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a disc orbiting exterior to a binary system in circular orbit using nirvana ( see , e.g. , ziegler & yorke 1997 ) .",
    "this code has been frequently used to simulate discs interaction with orbiting bodies ( e.g. , nelson et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the governing equations solved numerically express the conservation of mass and momentum for a razor thin disc . in a non rotating frame with origin at the location of the centre of mass of the binary ,",
    "these take the form :    @xmath3    @xmath4   =     -\\sigma { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}\\phi    +                                             { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\nabla$}}{{{\\bf{\\cdot } } } }   { \\bf t }                                             { +                                             \\sigma { \\bf f } } \\ , \\label{mog } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the surface density , @xmath6 is the velocity , @xmath7 is the stress tensor which has contributions from the vertically integrated pressure , @xmath8 and the standard navier ",

    "that the latter is set to zero in our grid based simulations but may be retained in our analytic discussion given in section  [ tidanal ] below . in the simulations presented below , we will use an  @xmath10prescription for the kinematic viscosity ( shakura & sunyaev  1973 ) .",
    "we adopt a system of dimensionless units for which the total mass of the binary system @xmath11 is unity . in these units ,",
    "the mass of the primary is @xmath12 and the mass of the secondary is @xmath13 we choose the unit of distance such that the separation , @xmath14 of the binary components , taken to be in circular orbit , is unity and the unit of time to be such that the binary angular frequency @xmath15 is unity .",

    "we have performed simulations on an equally spaced grid with @xmath25 grid points in the radial direction and @xmath26 grid points in the azimuthal direction . for the simulations presented here we have adopted @xmath27 and @xmath28 and checked that the same behaviour is obtained adopting twice the resolution in both @xmath29 and @xmath30    the discs are assumed to be locally isothermal with a constant aspect ratio @xmath31 thus @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the angular velocity . for kinematic viscosity , @xmath34 we adopt an @xmath10 prescription ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) with @xmath10 taken to be constant , i.e. @xmath35",
    ".    .parameters of models for which results are described in the text .",
    "the first column gives the model label , the second the adopted disc aspect ratio and the third gives the value of @xmath36 models a , b and c have the same effective kinematic viscosity while for model d this is a factor of two smaller [ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for models a and b , this quantity is respectively @xmath37 and @xmath38 , indicating that accretion is if anything modestly enhanced by the presence of the binary .",
    "this is in line with results given by shi & krolik ( 2015 ) . for model  c , which has the same kinematic viscosity prescription but the smallest @xmath39 it is reduced to @xmath40 , indicating that accretion is somewhat suppressed by the presence of the binary . for model  d , which has a same value of @xmath41 as model  c but a value of @xmath10 that has been reduced by a factor of two ,",
    "the averaged accretion rate ratio is reduced to @xmath42 this is a factor of @xmath43 smaller than the value for model  c , as compared to an expected reduction of a factor of two .",
    "this situation arises because at early times , measured in units of the characteristic viscous time of the model , the accretion rates are increasing , taken together with the fact that the characteristic viscous time is a factor of two longer for model  d as compared to the other models .",
    "if we compare the average accretion rate in model  c over the time interval @xmath44 which contracts the time limits by a factor of two , with the above rate for model  d evaluated as an average for @xmath45 it is smaller by a factor @xmath46 , as expected .",
    "we remark that @xmath47 where the fiducial accretion rate @xmath48 with @xmath49 evaluated for model  a. in addition , we note that a reduction in the ratio @xmath50 , similar to what we find here as @xmath41 is decreased , has been reported in sph simulations by ragusa et al .",
    "this corresponds to a suppression of the accretion rate into the binary system as a result of the action of tidal torques that is not seen in the simulations with larger @xmath31    however , it is important to note that in spite of this suppression , in a steady state we expect that the mass accretion rate at large distances should be the same as that onto the central binary .",
    "although it is impracticable to perform simulations for long enough with an adequate dynamic range in such cases , we expect that when suppression is large , the disc surface density just outside the cavity edge will significantly exceed that at large distances and that in the case of constant kinematic viscosity ( see section  [ stdisc ] below ) the ratio of these will be approximately equal to @xmath51 when considering the rate of energy dissipation due to tidal torques , as in this paper , the value of the surface density just outside the cavity edge , where these torques are applied , is the relevant one .",
    "this leads to the fiducial rate of energy dissipation @xmath52 , rather than @xmath53 (  see below ) .",
    "this can be estimated without connecting conditions near the cavity edge to conditions at large distance .",
    "as indicated above , angular momentum is transferred from the binary system to the disc through that action of compressional shocks and viscous friction .",
    "this transport maintains the cavity inside which the binary resides .",
    "the associated dissipation occurs independently of whether accretion into the binary system is suppressed or not .",
    "the upper panel of figure  ( [ shockd ] ) shows the total rate of shock dissipation as a function of time for @xmath54 in code units , for models  a and  b. the lower panel gives the corresponding quantity for models  c and  d. we note that the fiducial rate of dissipation associated with tides , indicated here through the rate of energy dissipation associated with artificial viscosity , is @xmath55 , with @xmath49 evaluated for model  a , and is equal to @xmath56 for models  a  c , the average dissipation rate is @xmath57 although most of this is concentrated in localised spikes . in model",
    "d , for which the effective viscosity was a factor of two smaller , the average rate of dissipation @xmath58 these results indicate that , unlike the accretion rate , the tidal dissipation is not greatly inhibited for small @xmath31 this occurs at approximately the same rate in all cases and this rate is approximately @xmath59 note that , as indicated above , the reduction by a factor of four rather than a factor of two in the case of model  d as compared to model  c can be accounted for by the increase in the rate of evolution that occurs as a function of time for models a  c .     in code units , for model  a ( _ solid line _ ) and model  b ( _ dashed line _ ) .",
    "the lower panel gives the corresponding plot for models  c ( _ solid line _ ) and  d ( _ dashed line _ ) . note that , in code units , the fiducial rate of dissipation given by @xmath60 , with @xmath49 evaluated for model  a ( see table [ table2 ] ) , is @xmath56 , title=\"fig : \" ] +   in code units , for model  a ( _ solid line _ ) and model  b ( _ dashed line _ ) .",

    "[ sec : analysis ]    we noted above that the rate of energy dissipation associated with the tidal interaction is approximately given by @xmath62 independently of whether accretion onto the central binary is significantly suppressed .",
    "we now explore a simple picture of this dissipation .",
    "we begin by considering an infinitesimal fluid element of mass @xmath63 occupying a varying area @xmath64 with surface density @xmath65 going on to derive an equation governing the evolution of the jacobi invariant associated with it .",
    "the constancy of @xmath63 is consistently implied by the continuity equation  ( [ contg ] ) . from equation  ( [ mog ] ) we obtain :    @xmath66    here : @xmath67    where the @xmath68component of @xmath69 is @xmath70 , and the second integral is obtained using green s theorem .",
    "it is taken over the boundary @xmath71 of the fluid element , with @xmath72 being the unit vector normal to the boundary and pointing outward , and so it is derived from the stresses due to exterior fluid .",
    "thus it could act like a drag force per unit mass . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we set @xmath73    using the fact that for our set up the gravitational potential @xmath9 is a function of @xmath21 and @xmath74 through the combination @xmath75 we obtain an equation for the rate of change of the jacobi invariant @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the kinetic plus potential energy and @xmath78 is the angular momentum of the fluid element .",
    "we begin by noting that we can obtain an equation for the rate of change of the kinetic energy of a fluid element from equation  ( [ mog ] ) under the form :    @xmath79    where @xmath80    with @xmath81 , represents the rate of doing work by internal stresses .",
    "this contains the rate of dissipation due to viscosity when that is present .",
    "we may also write equation  ( [ energy_eq ] ) as :    @xmath82    from the @xmath21component of equation  ( [ mom_eq ] ) , we obtain :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the unit vector in the azimuthal direction .",
    "multiplying equation  ( [ amom_eq ] ) by @xmath85 and subtracting the resulting equation from equation  ( [ energy2_eq ] ) we obtain :    @xmath86    note that this form applies in the inertial frame .",
    "suppose a fluid element near some inner disc edge undergoes cyclic behaviour such that , starting from a circular orbit , it moves inwards and as a result of interacting with the binary and surrounding fluid it then returns to the same edge where it is circularized .",
    "then the total change in jacobi constant is zero and from equation  ( [ jac_eq ] ) we have :    @xmath87    here the time integrals are over the duration of the process .",
    "equation ( [ jacan_eq ] ) states that the mean rate of energy dissipation through the action of the force @xmath88 as measured in the inertial frame , together with the mean rate of energy dissipation by internal stresses , is the product of the binary orbital frequency and time average of the torque exerted by the binary , @xmath89 taken over the duration of the process . that this is the time averaged torque exerted by the binary follows from ( [ amom_eq ] ) . as by assumption the fluid elements angular momentum",
    "is not changed through this process , the torque is communicated to material in contact .    as we know accretion into the binary system",
    "is ongoing , the fluid element will subsequently move away from the edge into the binary .",
    "a similar discussion could be applied to such a final stage if one knows the change in @xmath90 the jacobi invariant , during this process .",
    "as it is dynamical we shall assume this is small so that equation  ( [ jacan_eq ] ) applies throughout over extended time periods .",
    "we now connect the above discussion to standard accretion disc modelling that performs azimuthally averaging . within this framework",
    ", we consider a standard steady accretion disc with an inner boundary at which the above torque is applied by the binary and through which there is a constant accretion rate @xmath91 angular momentum conservation gives :    @xmath92    where @xmath33 is the local angular velocity and @xmath93 is the applied time averaged torque per unit radius .",
    "if we suppose that the torque is applied in a thin layer at an inner edge , integrating through this layer we get on the exterior @xmath94 side where @xmath95 :    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is again the time averaged total applied torque and @xmath98 indicates evaluation at @xmath99 however , integrating equation  ( [ accnd ] ) in the main body of the disc we have :    @xmath100    this equation determines the @xmath5 profile and rate of viscous energy dissipation as in a standard disc model .",
    "note that , as compared to the standard solution with a zero torque applied at the boundary , there is the additional @xmath101 term .",
    "this is responsible for an additional viscous dissipation rate in the disc amounting to @xmath102 this is comparable to , but significantly less than , the tidal dissipation rate estimated above as @xmath103 this is because the dissipation envisaged there can not all be associated with a simple shear viscosity .",
    "the difference @xmath104 must represent the dissipation rate associated with compressional shocks ( papaloizou & pringle 1977 ) .",
    "in addition , equation  ( [ accnd1 ] ) implies that the rate of dissipation due to tidal torques acting on a keplerian disc is @xmath105 this is similar to the fiducial rate seen in the simulations and given by : @xmath106 where @xmath107 should be thought of as being the value of @xmath5 just outside the cavity edge and @xmath108 is taken to be @xmath109    however when tidal torques are effective at restricting accretion , as noted above , in a steady state the surface density just exterior to the gap edge will significantly exceed the surface density at large distances . for the simple example where @xmath108 is constant , equation ( [ accnd2 ] ) implies that at larger distances @xmath110 where @xmath111 then : @xmath112 thus , in this case , the mean energy dissipation rate due to tidal torques will exceed @xmath113 by a factor approximately equal to the steady state accretion rate estimated adopting the value of the surface density just exterior to the cavity edge to the actual steady state accretion rate .",
    "in order to gain more insight into the nature and magnitude of the tidal dissipation occurring near the cavity boundary , we use a particle code to simulate the accretion flow around the binary .",
    "this is based on the fact that , apart from where shocks occur , the pressure force is small compared to the gravitational force ( or , equivalently , the sound speed is small compared to the keplerian velocity ) , which implies , to a good approximation , that the motion should be ballistic ( e.g. , shi et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the particles are set down at some distance @xmath29 from the binary center of mass @xmath114 and are initiated the local keplerian angular velocity @xmath115^{1/2 } $ ] in the inertial frame centered on @xmath114 .",
    "the particles move under the gravitational potential due to the stars . to force them to move towards the cavity ,",
    "we add a drag force per unit mass @xmath116 :    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is a free parameter , and @xmath119 is the acceleration in the inertial frame centered on @xmath114 .",
    "this form of the drag force ensures that it acts opposite to the velocity and , as the acceleration results mainly from gravitational forces , is @xmath120 times smaller than the gravitational force per unit mass . in practice",
    ", we only apply @xmath116 to particles beyond the inner radius of the cavity .",
    "this drag force mimics the action of disc viscosity , modelled using the @xmath10 prescription above , but more realistically resulting from turbulent processes arising from the magnetorotational instability . in a realistic situation",
    ", this would enable particles to lose angular momentum and get accreted onto the binary .",
    "the parameter @xmath120 defined through equation  ( [ fdrag ] ) can be approximated by @xmath121 . in a standard accretion disc ,",
    "@xmath122 where @xmath123 is the kinematic viscosity , with @xmath124 being the sound speed . using @xmath125",
    ", we obtain @xmath126 , which gives @xmath127 for models  a , b and  c and @xmath128 for model  d. however , at the disc s inner edge , the length scale is given by @xmath129 rather than @xmath29 , and the magnitude of the radial velocity in low surface density regions may be better approximated by @xmath130 .",
    "this would then lead to @xmath131 , i.e. @xmath132 for all the models  a  d .",
    "given that there is some uncertainty in the value of @xmath120 that should be used , we have varied @xmath120 between @xmath133 and a few times @xmath134 .    before being accreted by one of the stars",
    ", a particle may be accelerated onto a trajectory that sends it back to the circumbinary disc .",
    "when that happens , we assume that shocks recircularize the orbit of the particle and accordingly we reset its velocity to be the keplerian value .      the accretion flow is shown in figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) . as for the hydrodynamic simulations",
    ", we have @xmath135 , @xmath136 and distances are given in units of the binary separation ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the particles were initially set up on circular orbits with @xmath29 between @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the small black crosses represent the position of the particles and the large red crosses the position of the two stars , with the primary on the right  hand side , as in figures  ( [ inchhrvisc208])([incvisc208 ] ) .",
    "the red triangles on the figure indicate the position of the lagrangian points @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 from right to left .",
    "the value @xmath143 was adopted for the calculation shown in figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) , but the accretion flow is very similar for smaller values of @xmath120 .",
    "although it takes longer for particles to drift inwards when @xmath120 is reduced , the overall structure of the flow is not affected .",
    "the rotation of the binary is anti - clockwise . because the binary is rotating faster than the particles , in the co  rotating frame",
    "the motion of the particles is clockwise .",
    "particles that get close enough to one of the stars are captured onto orbits around the star , and circumstellar discs form .",
    "tidal truncation of these discs by the other star limits their outer radii , which are shown as the red circles on the figure .",
    "we find here that the radius @xmath144 of these discs is 0.4 times the binary separation , close to the value of one third predicted by theoretical studies ( paczynski 1977 , papaloizou & pringle 1977 ) .",
    "particles within these discs have been removed from the figure .    as can be seen from the plot ,",
    "the mean radius of the cavity cleared out by the binary is about 1.9 , close to the value of 2 expected from theory ( see lubow & artymowicz 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the details of the flow beyond this radius can not be captured by the particle code , as hydrodynamical effects become important there .",
    "the flow shown in figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) is very similar to that obtained from our hydrodynamical simulations ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ [ incvisc208 ] ] ) and also those of , e.g. , hanawa , ochi and ando ( 2010 ) , who considered a binary with a mass ratio similar to that adopted here .",
    "as has been noted in previous studies of circumbinary discs ( shi & krolik 2015 ) , material entering the inner cavity does not in general fall directly onto one of the circumstellar discs .",
    "a particle originating from the edge of the cavity may be accelerated by the gravitational torque on a trajectory that propels it back towards the circumbinary disc .",
    "shocks may then occur that result in circularization of the trajectory , the excess kinetic energy being released and radiated away .",
    "we model this process using the particle code in the following way .",
    "after a particle has entered the cavity , which is assumed to have a radius @xmath145 , if it is flung back out to the disc , i.e. is found with @xmath146 again , its velocity is reset to the keplerian value at this radius .",
    "the particle then resumes drifting towards the cavity .",
    "we note @xmath147 the kinetic energy which is released , and which is the difference between the kinetic energy @xmath77 of the particle when it reaches @xmath145 and the kinetic energy @xmath148 of the same particle undergoing keplerian motion there .",
    "to evaluate @xmath147 , we need in principle to know the value of @xmath145 .",
    "however , if we vary this radius between @xmath149 and @xmath150 for example , @xmath148 is found to vary only by a factor of 0.6 .",
    "since @xmath77 itself varies only by a factor of order unity when the particle goes from @xmath151 to @xmath152 , @xmath147 does not depend very sensitively on @xmath145 .",
    "in addition , as can be seen from figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) , the cavity is not actually circular .",
    "therefore , it is not essential for the argument to know @xmath145 precisely .",
    "if the distance between the particle and one of the stars becomes smaller than the radius @xmath144 of the circumstellar discs , it is then supposed to be accreted by the star .",
    "we fix @xmath153 .",
    "the radius of a particle moving inside the cavity as a function of time is shown in figure  ( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it moves slowly inwards in an orbit with steadily increasing eccentricity .",
    "it is then flung outwards ultimately being reset on a circular orbit at larger radii and the process then repeats until the particle is accreted by the binary .",
    "as can be seen , the particle undergoes both small and large excursions , indicating that there should be a corresponding range of shock strengths present as we found to be the case in our hydrodynamic simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ [ shockd ] ] ) . in the calculations presented in figure  ( [ fig5 ] ) ,",
    "the velocity of the particle is reset to the keplerian value if it is flung back to the disc and reaches @xmath154 after having gone down to @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , circularization proceeds only after a large excursion occurs . because we have chosen @xmath154 rather arbitrarily as the radius where circularization takes place , we can not calculate the real time between two collisions with this model .",
    "however , we can calculate the number of times a particle collides with the disc s inner edge before being accreted . for a fixed value of @xmath120 ,",
    "this number is obtained by averaging the results corresponding to many trajectories calculated for different initial conditions ( for a given @xmath120 , the trajectories for two different particles may be significantly different , which is why an averaging is required ) .",
    "we find that , for @xmath156 , on average particles get flung back out to the disc having undergone one or two large radial excursions . for higher values of @xmath120 ,",
    "the drift force is rather large and particles get accreted straight away without colliding with the disc . when collisions occur , particles hit the inner edge of the circumbinary disc at @xmath157 with a velocity which is on the order of the keplerian velocity at this radius but with a different orientation . therefore , @xmath158 .",
    "if the mass of particles drifting through the circumbinary disc s inner edge per unit time is @xmath159 , then the total kinetic energy released per unit time is @xmath160 .",
    "this is essentially the same as given by equation  ( [ edot ] ) if we identify @xmath161 the fiducial accretion rate which in steady state is @xmath162 ( see section  [ setup ] and table  [ table2 ] ) , and it corresponds to what is found in our hydrodynamic simulations in the cases of models  a and  b.    if @xmath120 is reduced to @xmath163 or @xmath164 particles move more slowly inwards and undergo more large radial excursions leading to more energy dissipated per particle as it is accreted .",
    "suppose this is @xmath165 with @xmath166 in our particle simulations , all the particles are forced inwards by the drag force given by equation  ( [ fdrag ] ) , and therefore they all end up being accreted by one of the stars .",

    "( 2016 ) that the accretion rate onto the binary is actually reduced below the fiducial value @xmath168 as @xmath41 and @xmath10 are reduced , which here corresponds to reducing @xmath169 on the other hand , as seen in the hydrodynamic simulations and confirmed by the analysis done in section  [ sec : analysis ] , the rate of energy dissipation at the disc s inner edge is determined by the tidal torque which maintains the cavity and is expected to be given by @xmath170 this leads us to identify @xmath171 in other words , the total energy which is dissipated , being tapped from the binary , depends only on the size of the cavity and the surface density at the inner edge , not on the actual accretion rate onto the binary .",
    "the above discussion implies that , when @xmath41 and @xmath10 ( or equivalently @xmath120 ) are decreased , as particles are accreted more slowly , each of them has to dissipate more energy , and therefore undergo more collisions , which is exactly what is seen in the results presented in figure  ( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath172 or @xmath133 , the tidal torques and related dissipation rate required to maintain the cavity ( see eq .",
    "[ [ edot ] ] ) can be maintained with an accretion rate onto the binary that is significantly less than the fiducial rate @xmath173 this would correspond to models  c and  d considered above where the accretion rate onto the binary is significantly less than @xmath173    figure  ( [ fig4 ] ) shows a sketch of the trajectories of the particles in the frame corotating with the binary near the edge of the circumbinary disc .",
    "particles that make it through one of the lagrangian points enter into orbital motion around one of the stars , whereas other particles are propelled back to the disc after having drifted inside the cavity . as can be seen from this figure ,",
    "the shocks tend to be localized at some specific locations rather than be uniformly distributed in azimuth .",
    "similar features were observed in the hydrodynamic simulations presented in section  [ sec : hydro_sim ] , although the location of the shocks changes with time .     or @xmath140 .",
    "they arrive at either of these points with a small speed and are subsequently accelerated on an anti  clockwise trajectory around one of the stars . ]",
    "in this section , we calculate the contribution from the collisions described above to the disc s spectral energy distribution . we model the circumbinary disc s inner edge as a `` wall '' with radius @xmath145 and vertical extension @xmath174 , as illustrated in figure  ( [ fig2 ] ) .        at radii @xmath175",
    ", the disc is heated by irradiation from the central stars and by dissipation of gravitational energy due to accretion .",
    "these sources contribute the energies per unit time per unit surface area @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively , where @xmath178 is the stefan-boltzmann constant and ( friedjung 1985 , lynden  bell & pringle 1974 ) : @xmath179    in equation  ( [ tdiscacc ] ) , @xmath180 is what has been defined in section  [ sec : hydro_sim ] as the _ fiducial _ accretion rate , which in steady state is @xmath181 . here",
    "we have assumed @xmath182 and replaced the two stars with luminosities , radii and masses@xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively , by one `` equivalent '' star located at the center of mass with temperature @xmath186 given by @xmath187 , radius @xmath188 such that @xmath189 and mass @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , the surface temperature @xmath191 of the disc at @xmath192 can be calculated from : @xmath193    note that equation  ( [ tdiscirr ] ) assumes that the disc is of constant aspect ratio , i.e. @xmath41 is constant . if the disc were flared , the temperature due to irradiation would be larger at larger radii , but since we are only concerned here with the spectral energy distribution near the disc s inner edge we will ignore such complications .",
    "we have also assumed in using equation  ( [ tdiscirr ] ) that the entire star could be seen from any point at the surface of the disc .",
    "this would not be the case if @xmath194 were comparable to or larger than @xmath188 , in which case the temperature due to irradiation would be significantly smaller than that given by equation  ( [ tdiscirr ] ) . as this would only reinforce the conclusions presented below , we will also ignore this effect .    at @xmath195",
    ", the disc s inner wall is heated by irradiation from the central stars and by the energy released through the action of tidal torques .",
    "that release occurs through shock dissipation and viscous friction in the hydrodynamic model and collisions that result in circularization just beyond the disc edge in the particle model .",
    "these sources , respectively , contribute the energies per unit time per unit surface area @xmath196 and @xmath197 , with : @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the surface of the wall over which collisions occur .",
    "the factor @xmath200 accounts for the fact that shocks are not distributed uniformly in azimuth . from the point of view of the particle model",
    ", we have assumed that the particles that are propelled back to the disc collide and are thermalized at @xmath195 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the hydrodynamic simulations presented in section  [ sec : hydro_sim ] ( see also shi & krolik  2015 ) show that the edge of the cavity is very sharp , with the mass density dropping by several orders of magnitude over a few scale heights .",
    "therefore , the particles that drift in the cavity and are propelled back to the disc do not penetrate significantly through the disc .    at locations where shocks occur , i.e. over a surface of area @xmath201 , the temperature @xmath202 at the disc s inner edge can be calculated from : @xmath203 whereas at locations where there are no shocks , i.e. over a surface area @xmath204 , it is given by @xmath205 .",
    "hereafter we will take : @xmath206 as this gives the correct order of magnitude for the energy released by the collisions ( see previous sections and eq .  [",
    "[ edot ] ] ) . here",
    "again , @xmath180 is the _ fiducial _ accretion rate , as this is what sets the level of energy dissipation at the disc inner edge , even when the accretion rate onto the binary is reduced .",

    "this is because , although @xmath235 given by equation  ( [ tincoll ] ) increases slightly when @xmath234 decreases ( as @xmath236 ) , the surface that re  radiates the energy dissipated through shocks is reduced .",
    "the net effect is therefore not very significant .",
    "figure  ( [ fig3 ] ) shows that at wavelengths between 14 and 10  @xmath0 m , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is completely dominated by emission from the disc s inner edge .",
    "this emission is itself dominated by the shocks produced by fluid particles being propelled back to the disc for large fiducial accretion rates exceeding about @xmath228  @xmath230  yr@xmath231 . the maximum of the excess moves towards smaller wavelengths when the surface over which shocks occur is decreased . for smaller accretion rates , irradiation by the stars",
    "is the main source of emission from the disc s inner edge . for @xmath237  @xmath230  yr@xmath231 ,",
    "the sed is indistinguishable from that corresponding to @xmath238  @xmath230  yr@xmath231 , as the contribution to the sed from accretion becomes negligible .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that energy has to be dissipated in the circumbinary disc for the tidal torque to maintain the cavity .",
    "energy dissipation happens at the inner edge of the disc through compressional shocks produced by fluid that is propelled back to the disc after drifting inwards into the cavity .",
    "the rate of energy dissipation does not depend on the actual accretion rate onto the binary , only on what we call the _ fiducial _ accretion rate through the disc , @xmath180 , which is determined by the state variables in the disc just beyond the cavity edge",
    ". this would be the accretion rate onto the central object if it was a single star rather than a binary and the material near the cavity edge was part of a putative exterior steady state disc .",
    "energy dissipation occurs at the fiducial rate even when the accretion rate onto the binary is reduced below @xmath180 ( which happens when the aspect ratio and viscosity of the disc is reduced ) .",
    "the rate of energy dissipation is typically @xmath239 , where @xmath145 is the inner radius of the circumbinary disc .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations ( see also the mhd simulations performed by shi & krolik 2015 ) show that the edge of the circumbinary disc is very sharp",
    ". therefore emission of the energy released by the shocks is localised at the edge .",
    "in addition , this edge is irradiated by the central stars and this also contributes to the sed of the system .    in a tight pms binary with a separation of @xmath1  r@xmath2 , emission from the disc s inner edge completely dominates the sed in the mid  infrared , i.e. for @xmath2404 to 10  @xmath0 m . for large values of the accretion rate @xmath180 exceeding about @xmath228  @xmath230  yr@xmath231",
    ", the emission predominantly comes from the shocks derived from fluid elements being propelled back towards the disc",
    ". for lower accretion rates , irradiation from the central star becomes the main source of emission from the inner edge .",
    "when shocks dominate , we expect the sed to display some variability , as the shock dissipation rate varies with time ( see fig .",
    "[ [ shockd ] ] ) on a timescale of a few @xmath61 , where @xmath85 is the angular velocity of the binary , i.e. comparable to the binary period .",
    "even when irradiation dominates , we would expect some variability on a timescale comparable to the binary period as the distance between the edge of the disc and the stars varies as the stars move around their centre of mass .",
    "corot  223992193 is a double - lined pms eclipsing binary which was discovered by gillen et al .",
    "its age has been estimated to be between 3.5 and 6 myr .",
    "the sed of this system presents a mid  infrared excess between 4 and 10  @xmath0 m .",
    "gillen et al . ( 2014 ) found that this excess could not be produced by a circumbinary disc unless it had an accretion rate of @xmath241  @xmath230  yr@xmath231 , four orders of magnitude higher than the accretion rate derived from the h@xmath10 emission from the stars .",
    "it was then proposed that the excess may be due to thermal emission from dust present in the vicinity of the two stars . as little as @xmath242  m@xmath2 of dust would be needed to produce the observed flux .",
    "this dust may also be responsible for the out  of eclipse variability observed in this system ( terquem , srensen ",
    "clark & bouvier 2015 ) .    here",
    ", we comment that the excess emission observed for corot  223992193 is very similar to what would be expected from the inner edge of a circumbinary disc . in this system",
    ", emission would not be dominated by the shocks as the accretion rate onto the stars is only @xmath243  @xmath230  yr@xmath231 and the fiducial accretion rate through the disc is probably not that much larger ( as @xmath41 is not expected to be smaller than 0.05 or so in a disc around a pms binary ) .",
    "emission would then be produced by irradiation from the stars . with @xmath244",
    ", the disc s inner edge would produce a flux with a maximum of about @xmath245  erg  @xmath246  s@xmath231 at a wavelength between 3 and 4  @xmath0 m , and a flux about 3.5 times smaller at 10  @xmath0 m ( see the lower plots on fig .  [ [ fig3 ] ] ) .",
    "the maximum value of the flux would be increased up to @xmath247  erg  @xmath246  s@xmath231",
    "if we adopted @xmath248 instead .",
    "such an enhanced value of the disc s aspect ratio near the edge of the cavity is consistent with 3d mhd simulations ( shi & krolik  2015 ) and may be produced by magnetic fields that get relatively stronger in the cavity .",

    "given that we have calculated irradiation of the disc s inner edge in a very crude way , our results are close enough to the observations that emission from the disc s inner edge appears as a serious candidate for producing the observed excess .",
    "we note that , as the system is seen with an inclination @xmath225 ( gillen et al .",

    "these observations also show that the minimum value of the luminosity ratio is 30% larger than what would be expected in the case of no accretion .",
