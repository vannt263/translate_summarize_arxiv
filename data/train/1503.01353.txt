    "transition metal oxides ( tmo ) host complex phases resulting from interactions with a hierarchy of energy scales . in @xmath7 and @xmath8 tmos , competition between kinetic energy , quantified by the parameter , @xmath4 , and coulomb repulsion , parameterized by @xmath9 , are the major factors determining the nature of lowest energy phases . however , in @xmath10 systems the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction , which plays a subsidiary role in the lighter tm s , becomes an equal partner in shaping the nature of the electronic states .",
    "the iridate family of tmo s are a particularly striking example of interplay between so and @xmath9 interactions .",
    "it is proposed that strong so interaction reorganizes the crystal field states of the @xmath10 orbitals into a @xmath11-multiplet structure , where @xmath11 is the combined spin and orbital angular momentum .",

    "@xcite    in addition to the questions concerning the origin of the insulating ground state and low - lying electronic excitations , there is considerable interest in the magnetic correlations in iridates . in compounds of the form a@xmath1iro@xmath2 , where a is na or li , the combination of strong so coupling and edge sharing iro@xmath15 octahedra is thought to give rise to anisotropic kitaev magnetic exchange .",

    "first , we recognize that excited states are created simultaneously with the absorption of the pump photons .",
    "therefore , the relatively slow risetime of @xmath3 indicates that the initial photoexcited state , which we label 1 , does not generate a measurable change in reflectance at the probe photon energy of 1.5 ev .",

    "the physical picture for the correlation between @xmath75 and @xmath74 is that , with decreasing @xmath5 , the increased lifetime of the initial ( but invisible ) state allows more time for build - up of the secondary ( but observable ) state .",
    "as previously noted , this linear relationship between @xmath75 and @xmath74 holds for lio , while in nio we observe a power law relationship with an exponent of 1.75 .",
    "this difference could arise from @xmath5-dependence in nio of @xmath85 or the proportionality of @xmath3 to @xmath92 , both of which could potentially give rise to a power law different from one over the relatively small @xmath5 range from 7 to 27 k.      in this section we describe the dependence of @xmath3 on the polarization of the probe pulse and discuss the relationship between anisotropy and the absence of the critical component in nio . fig .",

    "however , as @xmath5 reaches @xmath13 , the nature of the anisotropy changes with the appearance of the large critical component discussed above .",
    "although the step - like change in @xmath3 is observed for both directions of @xmath96 , the amplitude of the step is approximately 2 - 3 times larger for @xmath96 parallel to * a * , as illustrated in fig . 8c .",

    "this basic structural difference immediately suggests an explanation for the missing critical component in nio : _ the component of the optical response at 1.5 ev that is sensitive to the magnetic order parameter is polarized in the direction normal to the ir hexagons_. while this clearly can account for the lack of a step in @xmath95 in nio at its @xmath13 of 14 k , below we show that same assumption can acccount for the observed anistropy in lio as well .    to model the component of @xmath95 in lio that depends on @xmath60",

    "the optical response in the _ a - b _ plane is the sum of contributions from two sets of hexagons counter - rotated by @xmath105 , corresponding to the @xmath106 angle observed between honeycomb chains in lio .",
    "@xcite with this assumption we can write the components of the polarizability tensor for directions * a * and * b * in terms of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath107 the model predicts a polarizability ratio , @xmath108 , which is consistent with both the direction and magnitude of the observed anistropy .",

    "9 , there are two _ c_-oriented links in lio : one that bridges two chains of hexagons and another that forms a bond in each ir hexagon .",

    "the abrupt appearance of a positive component in both @xmath97 and @xmath98 at @xmath13 is consistent with the idea that the spin order that onsets at @xmath13 is distinct from the kitaev - like spin alignment that appears in the normal state .",

    "@xcite at photon energies below 1 ev the optical conductivity of lio is equal to that of nio within experimental uncertainty , indicating that the low - energy electronic excitations are very similar , despite their structural differences .",
    "detailed measurements of the transient reflectance of lio as a function of delay time and temperature reveal a three component picture , with significant anisotropy with respect to the direction of the probe electric field in the _ ab _ plane .",
    "in contrast , the transient reflectance of nio is isotropic , as expected for reflection from a planar hexagonal structure , and has only one temperature dependent component .    of the three components observed in lio ,",
    "one clearly has the same origin as the single component observed in nio , as judged from the similiarity of the time delay and temperature dependence .",
    "the excited state that gives rise to this component can be characterized as metastable , as once it appears on a 10 ps time scale it survives for several hundred picoseconds .",
    "the same photoexcitation state has been seen previously in a transient grating study of nio ,  @xcite where it was proposed that @xmath6 at low @xmath5 arises from low - lying holon - doublon states that are bound by the energy cost of deforming nio s `` zig - zag '' magnetic structure .",
    "however , given that this component of @xmath6 is essentially identical in the two compounds despite the fact that lio manifests incommensurate spiral rather than commensurate ziz - zag order , it is clear that the nature of photoexcited quasiparticles in these hexagonal iridates is not determined by the form of long - range magnetic order .",
    "it is likely that the properties of these states derive from the local electronic structure of the edge - sharing ir - o octahedra .",
    "whether these excitations are topologically trivial , for example spin polarons , or more exotic topologically protected quasiparticles , remains a subject for future research .",
    "in particular , measurements of the conductivity of the photoexcited state , either by direct transport or contactless terahertz methods , can determine whether these excitations are charged or neutral .",
    "certainly , understanding the nature of the low - lying photoexcited states takes on a heightened significance if future work confirms that iridates exhibit high-@xmath13 superconductivity when doped .",
    "the components of @xmath3 that are unique to lio are associated with magnetic order .",
    "one component onsets discontinuously at @xmath13 , with a divergent rise time , indicating that is associated with critical slowing down at a continuous transition to a long - range ordered state .",
    "the step - like increase in @xmath3 is roughly twice larger for probe electric field parallel to the * a * than to * b*. we showed that this anisotropy is consistent with the hypothesis that the optical transitions in lio that are sensitive to long - range magnetic order are polarized in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the ir hexagons .",
    "this same hypothesis can then account for the absence of a critical component of @xmath3 in nio at its critical temperature of 14 k , as in the layered honeycomb structure the probe electric field is oriented parallel to the ir hexagons .",

    "<S> we report equilibrium and nonequilibrium optical measurements on the recently synthesized `` harmonic '' honeycomb iridate @xmath0li@xmath1iro@xmath2 ( lio ) , as well as the layered honeycomb iridate na@xmath1iro@xmath2 ( nio ) . using fourier </S>",
    "<S> transform infrared microscopy we performed reflectance measurements on lio , from which we obtained the optical conductivity below 2 ev . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we measured the photoinduced changed in reflectance , @xmath3 , as a function of time , @xmath4 , temperature , @xmath5 , and probe field polarization in both lio and nio . in lio , @xmath6 is anisotropic and comprised of three @xmath5 dependent components . </S>",
    "<S> two of these components are related to the onset of magnetic order and the third is related to a photoinduced population of metastable electronic excited states . in nio , @xmath6 has a single @xmath5 dependent component that is strikingly similar to the electronic excitation component of @xmath3 in lio . through analysis and comparison of @xmath6 for two compounds , </S>",
    "<S> we extract information on the onset of magnetic correlations at and above the transition temperature in lio , the bare spin - flip scattering rate in equilibrium , the lifetime of low - lying quasiparticle excitations , and the polarization dependence of optical transitions that are sensitive to magnetic order . </S>"
