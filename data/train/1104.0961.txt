    "the food arrives on a common platter , and each friend has his own favourite and not - so - favourite dishes among the spread .",
    "hunger is a cruel master , and each of our otherwise considerate companions finds himself racing to swallow his favourites before his comrade can scoop them up .",

    "_ ethiopian dinner _ is a finite set @xmath0 whose elements are called _ morsels_. each morsel @xmath1 is an ordered pair of real numbers @xmath2 .",
    "two players , alice and bob , take turns removing one morsel from  @xmath3 and eating it .",
    "the morsels are discrete and indivisible : each morsel can be eaten exactly once , and the game ends when all morsels have been eaten",
    ". the larger the value of @xmath4 , the tastier the morsel for alice ; the larger @xmath5 , the tastier for bob .",
    "we assume that the _ players know one another s preferences _ , and that the preferences are totally ordered , that is , @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "alice s score is the sum of the  @xmath4 for the morsels  @xmath1 she eats , while bob s score is the sum of the  @xmath5 for the morsels  @xmath1 he eats .",
    "in such a game , the players are not adversaries ; in fact , the game may end quite peaceably and successfully for both players if they have dissimilar tastes .",
    "the question we are interested in is this : if a player acts rationally to maximize her own score , and assumes that her meal partner does the same , what should be her strategy ? eating your favourite morsel on the first move of an ethiopian dinner is not necessarily a good strategy .",
    "for example , if the dinner is @xmath9 then alice s favourite morsel is @xmath10 .",
    "if she takes this morsel first , then bob will take @xmath11 , leaving alice with @xmath12 for a total score of @xmath13 .",
    "instead alice should snag @xmath11 on the first move ; after bob takes @xmath12 , alice can finish up with @xmath10 for dessert and a total score of @xmath14 .",
    "if deciding on the first move in an ethiopian dinner appears complicated , the _ last move _ is a different matter .",
    "the subject of this paper is a strategy discovered by kohler and chandrasekaran  @xcite , which we call the _ crossout strategy_. its mantra is :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` _ eat your opponent s least favourite morsel on your own last move .",

    "my opponent will never choose her least favourite morsel , unless it is the only one left ; therefore , unless this is my last move , i can safely save my opponent s least favourite morsel for later .",
    "this reasoning predicts that if , say , bob has the last move of the game , then bob s last move will be to eat alice s least favourite morsel . because this is a game of perfect information , both players can use this reasoning to predict with certainty the game s last move .",
    "we now cross out alice s least favourite morsel from the dinner @xmath3 to arrive at a smaller dinner @xmath15 in which alice has the last move .",
    "the same reasoning now implies that on her last move , alice will eat bob s least favourite morsel in @xmath15 .",
    "we then cross out bob s least favourite morsel from @xmath15 and proceed inductively , alternately crossing out alice s least favourite and bob s least favourite among the remaining morsels until all morsels have been crossed out .",
    "the _ crossout strategy _ is to eat the _ last _ morsel to be crossed out .      to convert the informal reasoning above into a proof that crossout is a `` good strategy , '' we need to define both words ! a _ strategy _ is any function @xmath16 from nonempty dinners to morsels , such that @xmath17 for all nonempty dinners @xmath3 . playing strategy @xmath16",
    "means that if it is your turn and the remaining set of morsels is @xmath3 , then you eat the morsel @xmath18 . for example , the _",
    "alice greedy _ strategy chooses the morsel @xmath19 such that @xmath4 is largest .",
    "either player could play this strategy .",
    "( it would be pretty spiteful of bob to do so ! ) other examples are the `` competitive '' strategy that chooses the morsel maximizing @xmath20 , the `` alice cooperative '' strategy choosing the morsel maximizing @xmath21 , and the `` alice masochistic '' strategy choosing the morsel minimizing @xmath4",
    ". a strategy can be as complicated as you like : perhaps if the number of morsels is prime , you greedily choose your own favourite morsel , and otherwise you spitefully choose your opponent s favourite .",
    "the appropriate notion of good strategy depends on the class of games one is considering .",
    "ethiopian dinner is a nonzero - sum game : one player s gain may not be the other s loss .",
    "in such a game , the basic requirement of any pair of good strategies ( one for alice , one for bob ) is that they form a _",
    "nash equilibrium _ , which means that neither player can benefit himself by changing strategies unilaterally .",
    "a nash equilibrium represents a stable , predictable outcome : alice can declare , `` i am playing my equilibrium strategy , and you d do best to play yours . ''",

    "which properties again depends on the class of games being considered . in game theory lingo ,",
    "ethiopian dinner is a _ perfect - information _ _ non - cooperative game in extensive form_. that is , both players know the values @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( perfect information ) ; the players may not bargain or make side deals ( non - cooperative ) ; and the players alternate making moves ( extensive form ) .",
    "non - cooperative games model situations in which the players have no way of communicating ( our dinner guests may be too busy stuffing their faces to bother with conversation ) or are forbidden to collude .",
    "for instance , airlines are forbidden by law from colluding to fix prices .",
    "colluding to fix the outcome of a meal is still legal in most countries , but alice might nevertheless be dissuaded by cultural taboo from making propositions like `` if you pay me fifty cents i promise not to eat any more spinach . ''    an ethiopian dinner with @xmath25 morsels is certain to end in @xmath25 moves .",
    "a widely accepted notion of a good strategy for games of this type ( perfect information , non - cooperative , extensive form , finite length ) is the _ subgame perfect equilibrium_. this is a refinement of the nash equilibrium which requires that the strategies remain in equilibrium when restricted to any subgame . in our case ,",
    "a subgame is just a _ subdinner _ consisting of a subset of the morsels , with the same player moving last .",
    "a subgame perfect equilibrium is robust in the sense that even if one player , say bob , makes a `` mistake '' on a particular move by deviating from his equilibrium strategy , alice can confidently continue playing her equilibrium strategy because the same strategy pair is still an equilibrium of the resulting subgame .",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite and @xcite for background on these concepts .",
    "let @xmath26 be the crossout strategy described above for ethiopian dinner .",
    "we will give a new proof of the following theorem , which is due to kohler and chandrasekaran  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : crossoutequil ] the pair @xmath27 is a subgame perfect equilibrium .    in other words ,",
    "if alice plays crossout , then bob can not benefit himself by playing a different strategy , and vice versa .",
    "figure  [ fig : typicalscores ] illustrates theorem  [ thm : crossoutequil ] in the case of a particular _ permutation dinner _",
    ", that is , a dinner of the form @xmath28 where @xmath24 is a permutation of the numbers @xmath29 .",
    "each dot in the figure represents the outcome of a strategy pair , with alice s score plotted on the horizontal axis and bob s score on the vertical axis , for the following permutation dinner of size @xmath30 : @xmath31 to visualize theorem  [ thm : crossoutequil ] , note that the large dot @xmath32 in figure  [ fig : typicalscores ] , which represents the outcome when both players play crossout , is rightmost among all possible outcomes achievable by alice given that bob plays crossout ( such outcomes are indicated by light dots @xmath33 ) .    recall that _ any _ function @xmath16 from dinners to morsels such that @xmath17 for all dinners @xmath3 counts as a strategy .",
    "in particular , let @xmath34 be the number of moves that alice makes in @xmath3 .",
    "for any subset @xmath35 of size @xmath34 , there is a strategy pair @xmath36 such that if alice plays @xmath16 and bob plays @xmath37 , then alice will eat precisely the morsels in @xmath38 and bob will eat the rest .",
    "this is how we computed the set of all dots in figure  [ fig : typicalscores ] .",
    "part of the difficulty of proving that a pair of strategies is in equilibrium  and also part of the power of the result once it is proved",
    " stems from the vast number of possible strategies .",
    "how are we to rule out that _ any conceivable _",
    "strategy @xmath16 , which might be arbitrarily subtle , clever and complicated , performs better against @xmath26 than does @xmath26 itself ? for all we know , alice has access to unlimited computational resources , and her strategy @xmath16 could involve factoring enormous integers or solving large instances of the traveling salesman problem .",
    "nevertheless , theorem  [ thm : crossoutequil ] ensures that if bob plays @xmath26 , then alice would do at least as well playing @xmath26 as @xmath16 . in a sense ,",
    "a theorem about equilibrium is a theorem about the limits of intelligence : an equilibrium enables you to hold the line against a smarter opponent !      in games arising in the real world , for instance in evolutionary dynamics and in economics , the appeal of the nash equilibrium concept is twofold .",
    "first , it can explain why we observe certain strategies and not others .",
    "second , even in the case of a game that has multiple equilibria and lacks a well - defined `` best '' outcome , knowing an explicit equilibrium provides certainty .",
    "alice simply announces her intention to play crossout , refers bob to the proof of theorem  [ thm : crossoutequil ] and trusts that his own best interest compels him to follow suit .",
    "what might have been a tense evening with an unpredictable outcome becomes a more relaxed affair in which each player can predict in advance which morsels she will be gobbling up .    to reap these benefits ,",
    "the players must be able to compute an equilibrium pair , not just know that one exists ! a recent strand of research , popularized by the slogan `` _ _ if your laptop ca nt find it , then , probably , neither can the market _ _ , '' has explored the tendency for equilibria to be extremely difficult to compute  @xcite .",
    "the general existence proof for subgame perfect equilibria ( * ? ? ? * viii.2.10 ) uses a backward induction from the last move : if converted naively into an algorithm , it would seem to require searching through exponentially many move sequences in order to find an equilibrium .",
    "this kind of brute force search is typically out of the question even for games of moderate size ( for example , an ethiopian dinner of @xmath25 morsels has @xmath39 possible move sequences ) . for this reason ,",
    "it is always interesting to identify special classes of games that have efficiently computable equilibria .",
    "the crossout equilibrium for ethiopian dinner is an example : if both players play the crossout strategy , then they eat the morsels in reverse order of the crossouts . in this case , the entire move sequence of the dinner can be worked out in the order @xmath40 time it takes to sort the two lists @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a _ dinner _ is a finite set of morsels @xmath41 each morsel @xmath42 comes with a pair of real numbers @xmath43 representing its utility to alice and bob .",
    "we often write @xmath44 as an ordered pair , @xmath45    we adopt the convention that _ bob has the final move _ by default . since moves alternate , the first move is determined by the parity of @xmath25 .",
    "alice has the first move if @xmath25 is even , and bob has the first move if @xmath25 is odd .",
    "a _ strategy _ is a map assigning to any non - empty dinner @xmath3 a morsel @xmath17 to be eaten by the first player .",
    "suppose that @xmath46 is a player , @xmath3 is a dinner , and that @xmath47 plays strategy @xmath16 . if it is @xmath47 s turn to move , he selects morsel @xmath18 and receives payoff @xmath48 .",
    "the remaining dinner is @xmath49 , with his opponent to move .",
    "suppose his opponent plays strategy  @xmath50 .",
    "the _ score _ @xmath51 of player @xmath47 is defined by the recurrence @xmath52 where for @xmath42 , the dinner @xmath53 denotes @xmath3 with morsel @xmath44 removed . since @xmath3 has finitely many morsels , equation defines @xmath51 uniquely .",
    "our convention in denoting a player s score is that his own strategy is always the first listed in the ordered pair .",
    "formally , we can regard ethiopian dinner as a single game whose positions comprise all finite dinners .",

    "alice starts at the left and scans rightward , placing the label @xmath76 below her least favourite morsel .",
    "then bob starts at the bottom and scans upward , placing the label @xmath77 to the left of his least favourite unlabeled morsel .",
    "the players alternate in this fashion until all morsels are labeled .",

    "alice always performs the first crossout , because of our convention that bob has the last move .",
    "hence , the odd labels appear on alice s axis and the even labels on bob s axis .",
    "the central lemma needed to show that crossout is an equilibrium is the following .",

    "in particular , for any @xmath89 we have @xmath90    given @xmath91 , let us say @xmath34 is _ jumpy _ if the label @xmath34 is strictly closer to the origin in @xmath83 than in @xmath81 .",

    "an interesting property of the crossout strategy , which we leave as an exercise to the reader since it is not needed for the proof of the main theorem , is that if both players follow it , then the first player eventually eats her favourite morsel .",

    "bob must then return the favor by refraining from eating @xmath135 on the fourth move . because of the trust it requires , it is hard to imagine the players achieving this outcome if they are not able to communicate .    to see how often crossout is pareto inefficient , we used sage mathematics software  @xcite to check 10000 randomly generated permutation dinners of size  16 for pareto efficiency : in all but 672 cases the @xmath27 outcome was pareto efficient , and in all but 241 it was weakly pareto efficient ( that is , no other outcome resulted in strict improvements for both players ) .",
    "the improvement in scores achieved by alternate outcomes was small : in an exhaustive check of all possible game outcomes in all @xmath136 dinners , the largest improvement for any player was less than @xmath137 .",

    "if we define an _ outcome _ for alice as the set of utilities of the morsels she eats , then the number of conceivable outcomes ( over all permutation dinners of size @xmath186 ) is the binomial coefficient @xmath187 .",
    "but not all of these outcomes are achievable if both players play the crossout strategy . for instance",
    ", alice never has to eat her least favourite morsel ( of utility @xmath76 ) , and she eats at most one of her three least favourite morsels ( of utilities @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath184 ) . in general , for each @xmath188 she eats at most @xmath102 of her @xmath189 least favourite morsels .",
    "hopkins and jones @xcite show that if both players play crossout , then the number of attainable outcomes for alice is the famous catalan number @xmath190 , and the number of attainable outcomes for bob is @xmath191 .",

    "@xcite in which a cake ( identified with the interval @xmath192 $ ] ) comes equipped with a measure for each player describing the utility to him of eating a given piece .",
    "one problem is to find an _ envy - free _ partition of the cake , which means that each player prefers the piece assigned to him over the pieces assigned to the other players . when the cake is comprised of indivisible slices ( as , for example , in a game of ethiopian dinner ) , this criterion becomes impossible to achieve in general , and finding an envy - minimizing allocation is a hard computational problem  @xcite .",
    "the outcome of the crossout strategy is reasonably close to envy - free : the first player is not envious , and the second player s envy is bounded by the utility of his favourite morsel . another way of achieving an approximately envy - free allocation is described in ( * ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) .",
    "the algorithm described there is even faster than crossout , because it does not require sorting the lists of utilities . in the case when an envy - free allocation exists , the _ undercut procedure _ of  @xcite gives an algorithm for finding one .      who takes the first bite at dinner might seem of little consequence , but imagine instead that alice and bob are taking turns dividing up the assets of their great uncle s estate .",

    "alice chooses the first item , then bob chooses the second and third , alice the fourth , and so on .",
    "the thue - morse sequence is the unique sequence starting with @xmath38 that is fixed under the operation of replacing each term @xmath38 by @xmath194 and each term @xmath81 by @xmath195 .",

    "many amazing properties of this sequence can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a further innovation of @xcite aimed at reducing the first move advantage is simultaneous choices . on each turn",
    "both players choose a morsel , and if they choose distinct morsels then each eats his choice .",
    "if they choose the same morsel , then that morsel is marked as `` contested '' and simultaneous play continues with the remaining uncontested morsels .",
    "when only contested morsels remain , the players revert to the thue - morse order of play",
    ". it would be interesting to quantify the intuition that the thue - morse order tends to produce a fair outcome .",
    "some assumptions on the utilities would be needed : in the example of the estate , if the value of the mansion exceeds the combined value of all the other assets , then the first player retains an advantage no matter what .",
    "_ mechanism design _ asks how the rules of a game should be structured in order to induce the players to act in a certain way .",

    "in__sincere choice . making sincere choices in ethiopian dinner",
    "means playing the greedy strategy of always eating your favourite available morsel . because the greedy strategy pair is not an equilibrium , the players have an incentive to make insincere choices by playing the more complicated crossout strategy . how could the rules of ethiopian dinner be modified so as to make the greedy strategy pair an equilibrium ?",
    "brams and kaplan  @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ? * ch .  9 ) ) design a mechanism that allows the players of an ethiopian dinner to offer one another trades , and show that its effect is to make the greedy strategy pair an equilibrium .",
    "we conclude by describing a few natural variants that we do not know how to analyze .",
    "suppose that the utilities @xmath197 and @xmath198 depend not only on the morsel @xmath44 , but also on when it is eaten .",
    "a natural choice is to value a morsel eaten on turn  @xmath70 with @xmath199 times its usual value , for a parameter @xmath200 .",
    "thus , a morsel declines in value the longer it remains on the plate ( perhaps the delicate flavours are fading ) .",
    "the choice of exponential decay @xmath199 corresponds to the common assumption in economics that a payoff received in the future should be discounted to its net present value according to the prevailing interest rate . if the interest rate is @xmath201 , then @xmath202 . in the resulting game",
    ", each player feels an urgency to eat her favourites early on .",

    "perhaps the morsels come in different types and there are many identical morsels of each type",
    ". then you might start by playing greedily , while trying to infer your opponent s preferences from his play .",
    "once you start to form a picture of his preferences , you can start playing a crossout - style strategy .",

    "can deceit pay in a dinner of imperfect information ?",
    "ethiopian dinner resembles the process of draft picks in sports .",
    "each team participating in the draft has its own belief about how much each player is worth , and the teams draft players one at a time according to some predetermined order of play .",
    "typically , many teams ( more than two ! ) participate in the draft .",
    "brams and straffin  @xcite point out a number of pathologies in the case when the number of teams is greater than two .",
    "for example , it may be to a team s advantage to choose later in the draft . for players with certain specific preferences ( called `` gallant knights '' in @xcite )",
