    "the @xmath0 decomposition of einstein equations gives rise to a system of evolution equations and a set of constraints .",
    "although it is true that , at the analytical level and in the absence of boundaries , if the constraints are satisfied on an initial spacelike hypersurface , they remain satisfied at later times by virtue of the evolution equations , this is not the case in numerical simulations .",
    "if the continuum initial data satisfy the constraints exactly , then they will only satisfy the discretized constraints up to truncation error . in many cases ,",
    "initial errors grow exponentially , and sometimes even more rapidly .",
    "whether the violent growth of the constraints is causing the crash of numerical codes , or is simply the effect of a more general growth in the error , is not altogether clear .",
    "however , the hope is that , if the constraint growth can be prevented or at least alleviated , the runtime of numerical simulations may increase .    in recent years a number of techniques have been proposed aimed at damping the constraints or , at least , controlling their growth .",
    "these are the @xmath1-system @xcite , the fine tuning of parameters multiplying the constraints that are added to the evolution equations @xcite , the dynamical adjustment of such parameters @xcite , and the addition of variational derivatives of a constraint energy to the evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the method that we wish to investigate has remarkable similarities with the latter . when timelike boundaries are present all of these methods require constraint - preserving boundary conditions to prevent the injection of constraint violations .",
    "we begin with a simple observation .",
    "consider the first order scalar equation on the real line , @xmath2 where @xmath3 , supplemented with smooth initial data .",
    "if we make the ansatz @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and substitute it into ( [ eq : illposed ] ) , we obtain @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that the solution , @xmath7 , allows for unbounded growth , @xmath8 , such that the bound @xmath9 holds for any smooth initial data . ] shows that the initial value problem is ill - posed and , therefore , can not be consistently discretized in a stable way .",
    "now we modify our problem and assume that the constraint @xmath10 has to hold . clearly , if @xmath11 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : illposed ] ) , then @xmath12 , i.e. , the constraint propagation problem is also ill - posed .",
    "a crucial point is that we are allowed to add constraints and/or derivatives of constraints to the right hand side of the evolution equations without affecting the space of physical solutions ( i.e. , solutions that satisfy the constraints ) .",
    "for example , adding a spatial derivative of the constraint to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : illposed ] ) leads to @xmath13 this equation is parabolic and , most importantly , gives rise to a well - posed initial value problem for both the main and the constraint propagation systems .",
    "not only does the problem no longer suffer from unbounded growth of the constraints , but the modification also damps the high frequency constraint violations .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of boundaries , we can impose homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions on the constraint , @xmath14 , which , when translated in terms of the main variables become of neumann type , @xmath15 .",
    "this example , although trivial , clearly illustrates the potential benefits of dissipation .",
    "it allowed us to convert an ill - posed initial value problem into a well - posed initial - boundary value problem .",
    "to the right hand side of the evolution equation ( [ eq : illposed ] ) , would also have led to a well - posed initial - boundary value problem .",
    "however , this modification also gives rise to exponential growth of all fourier components of the constraints . ]    in this paper we investigate the effect of adding spatial derivatives of the constraints to the evolution equations for two formulations of maxwell s equations , the so - called fat maxwell @xcite ( first order ) and the knapp - walker - baumgarte ( kwb ) @xcite ( first order in time , second in space ) systems .",
    "as expected , the modification destroys the hyperbolic character of the systems .",
    "however , if done carefully , it can lead to mixed hyperbolic - parabolic systems both for the evolution equations and the evolution of the constraints , such that the high frequency components of the constraints are damped .    in the presence of timelike boundaries the systems that we analyze are such that constraint - preserving boundary conditions amount to imposing homogeneous dirichlet boundary data on the constraints , which translate into neumann - like boundary conditions for the main system .",
    "compared to standard constraint - preserving boundary conditions for hyperbolic problems @xcite , those that we obtain can be much simpler and possibly more robust .",
    "for example , if the constraint propagation system is strongly parabolic , then at the boundary we can impose that all constraints vanish , which is less involved than computing the incoming characteristic constraints and , as usually done , trading the normal with time and tangential derivatives using the evolution equations .",
    "further , the modified problems allow for a greater number of constraint components to be set to zero . unfortunately ,",
    " and this is presumably the most regrettable feature of this technique  due to the loss of finite speed of propagation , the time step needs to be proportional to the square of the mesh spacing in order to achieve numerical stability ( and convergence ) with explicit finite difference schemes .",
    "parabolic systems have received little attention in numerical relativity with some notable exceptions @xcite , in which the aim was primarily to promote elliptic gauge conditions to parabolic equations . although the technique of adding spatial derivatives of the constraints has been previously employed by yoneda and shinkai @xcite and by fiske @xcite ,",
    "the analysis of the character and the study of appropriate boundary conditions for the modified systems , to our knowledge , is new .",
    "we recall some basic definitions that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "consider the systems of partial differential equations in one space dimension @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are constant square matrices . system ( [ eq : parabolic ] ) is said to be _ strongly parabolic _ if the eigenvalues of @xmath22 are positive .",

    "this discretization is used for the hyperbolic sector of the kwb system .",
    "we use units where @xmath29 and adopt the einstein summation convention .",
    "the vacuum maxwell equations on a minkowski background in cartesian coordinates are given by @xmath30 in terms of the potentials , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the electric and magnetic fields are @xmath33 if we introduce the variables @xmath34 , we can rewrite maxwell s equations in the form @xcite @xmath35 where we used the identity @xmath36 .",
    "this system has 12 variables that depend on the space - time coordinates and is subject to 10 constraints .",
    "one can readily verify that the constraints propagate trivially , @xmath37 and that the evolution system is weakly hyperbolic , i.e. , it can not be diagonalized .",
    "however , by appropriately adding constraints to the right hand side of the evolution equations @xmath38 one can ensure that both the main evolution system and the evolution of the constraint variables are symmetric hyperbolic .",

    "any first order , linear , homogeneous , constant coefficient , symmetric hyperbolic system with no lower order terms admits , by definition , a conserved energy .",
    "an energy , in this context , is an integral over the spatial domain , @xmath41 , of a positive definite quadratic form of the main variables .",
    "the energies @xmath42 for example , are conserved up to contributions due to the boundary ( the conservation of @xmath21 requires the coulomb gauge , @xmath43 , which will henceforth be assumed ) .",
    "an immediate consequence of this is that , if @xmath44 or @xmath45 , the energy associated with an initial violation of the constraints will be preserved during evolution . we now show that by adding spatial derivatives of the constraints to the evolution equations it is possible to improve on this .",
    "the general idea is to add constraints and/or derivatives of constraints to the right hand side of the evolution equations that generate decaying or damping terms in the constraint propagation system .",

    "it is essential to check whether the modified systems still admit a well - posed initial value problem .",
    "we start by showing that both systems , ( [ eq : et])([eq : dt ] ) and ( [ eq : evolc1])([eq : evolc2 ] ) , satisfy a necessary condition for well - posedness , the petrovskii condition @xcite .",
    "we will show that for positive values of the parameter @xmath48 most fourier components of the constraint variables are damped .",
    "we then give an energy estimate for the evolution of the constraints systems and , as a byproduct , obtain constraint - preserving boundary conditions .",
    "our attempts at deriving an estimate for the main system have not been successful when boundary conditions consistent with the constraints are imposed .",
    "nevertheless , we found the one dimensional reduction of the problem to be well - posed and therefore used it as a tool for obtaining appropriate boundary conditions for the main system .",
    "the rationale being that any boundary condition that makes the reduced problem ill - posed would be unsuitable in higher dimensions .",
    "let @xmath49 be a system of linear constant coefficient partial differential equations in @xmath50 dimensions .",
    "assume for the moment that there are no boundaries . according to the petrovskii condition",
    ", it must be possible to bound the real parts of the eigenvalues of the symbol , or fourier transform , of the differential operator , @xmath51 , by a real constant @xmath52 , which is independent of @xmath53 . for scalar equations",
    "this condition is also sufficient .    to compute the symbols of ( [ eq : et])([eq : dt ] ) and ( [ eq : evolc1])([eq : evolc2 ] ) we use the substitution @xmath54 , where @xmath55 . from the evolution equations we get @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the evolution of the constraints yields @xmath62 the eigenvalues of the fourier transformed systems form a subset of @xmath63 hence the petrovskii condition is satisfied provided that @xmath64 . in particular",

    "we now calculate the time derivative of ( [ eq : ec ] ) .",
    "this is given by @xmath66 clearly , the volume integral gives a non - positive contribution to the time derivative of the energy and @xmath67 then the energy associated with the constraints will remain constant . ] and , therefore , by controlling the boundary term one can ensure that the energy associated with the constraints is non - increasing .",
    "boundary conditions that can be used for this purpose are @xmath68 when these 7 conditions are enforced we obtain the inequality @xmath69    we now turn to the main system . as mentioned earlier , in the presence of boundaries we were not able to obtain an energy estimate using conditions ( [ eq : dirc ] ) .",

    "we noticed that the modification alters the character of the systems , transforming them into mixed hyperbolic - parabolic problems .",
    "parabolicity introduces two remarkable effects .",
    "first , it damps the high frequency components of constraint violations ( whereas in the kwb case the damping affects all constraints , in the fat maxwell system some constraints are not damped ) .",
    "second , it allows for dirichlet boundary conditions for the constraints which naturally translate into neumann - like boundary conditions for the main system .",
    "these boundary conditions are constraint - preserving and , if the evolution of the constraints can be made strongly parabolic , their expression is simpler than that of the original hyperbolic system . furthermore , whereas other techniques , such as the @xmath1-system @xcite , require a substantial enlargement of the main system ,",
    "this method leaves the number of variables unchanged .",
    "although we were unsuccessful in obtaining an energy estimate for the main evolution systems , our numerical tests not only confirmed that the constraints are damped , but also indicated that the discretized systems are stable .",
    "the stringent requirement on the time step @xmath147 is possibly the greatest drawback of this technique . whereas for hyperbolic problems",
    "@xmath147 typically has to be proportional to the mesh spacing , @xmath149 , in parabolic or mixed hyperbolic - parabolic problems it has to be proportional to @xmath155 . to circumvent this restriction one could use implicit or semi - implicit schemes",
    "however , we have not yet experimented with such schemes .",
    "the damping terms introduced by the spatial derivatives of constraints vanish on physical ( constraint satisfying ) solutions .",
    "this indicates that dissipation will not detrimentally affect such solutions and , although constraint violations can travel at an infinite speed , any constraint satisfying solution will propagate information at a finite speed .",
    "of course , at the numerical level , the numerical speed of propagation usually only coincides with the continuum one up to truncation errors and it is even possible for high frequency modes to travel in the wrong direction @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that in the nonlinear or variable coefficient case , extra care is required for the successful application of this technique .",
    "the coefficients in front of the parabolic terms should never become negative , as this would immediately allow for unbounded growth and lead to instabilities .",
    "artificial dissipation of the kreiss - oliger type should still be added to the right hand side in order to damp high frequency components of the hyperbolic sector .",
    "in addition , this technique , just like most of the available cures for constraint growth , can not be expected to cure instabilities , such as `` gauge instabilities '' , that are not constraint violating .",
    "the technique illustrated in this work requires a different treatment of the excision boundaries , often used in numerical simulations of spacetimes containing black holes .",
    "whereas in hyperbolic formulations no boundary conditions are needed at the excision surface , provided that this is purely outflow , parabolicity demands boundary conditions .",
    "our expectation is that the use of dirichlet boundary conditions for the constraints at the excision boundary will help to prevent the growth of constraints near this troublesome region .    in this work",
    "we stressed how parabolicity can be obtained by adding spatial derivatives of constraints to the evolution equations . for systems , such as the ones studied in this paper , that have first order constraints ,",
    "this is the only way it can be achieved .",
    "however , for systems containing constraints with second spatial derivatives ( like the hamiltonian constraint of general relativity ) one may obtain parabolicity by appropriately adding such constraints without further differentiation .",
    "this approach of adding constraints and/or spatial derivatives of constraints to the evolution equations could be pushed further and one could consider the possibility of adding higher order spatial derivatives of constraints . however , in general , adding second spatial derivatives of first order constraints or first spatial derivatives of second order constraints will not damp high frequency components .",
    "it will only render the constraint propagation more dispersive . on the other hand , adding third spatial derivatives of first order constraints or second spatial derivatives of second order constraints can help to dissipate the high frequencies .",
    "certainly , it is preferable to avoid increasing the order of the formulation , as this would complicate the treatment of boundaries .    although the problems to which our technique was applied do not present the full range of difficulties contained in einstein s equations , based on the success of the tests that we presented we hope that the technique may prove helpful in a more complex situation .",
