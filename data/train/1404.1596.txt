    "the interest of geometric techniques for investigating systems of differential equations is undeniable @xcite . for instance",
    ", symplectic and poisson geometry techniques have been employed to uncover interesting structures of many dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "further , other more recently discovered geometric structures , e.g. dirac or jacobi structures , have also proved their usefulness for studying differential equations and related topics @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus upon the study of a particular class of differential equations , the lie systems @xcite , by means of the referred to as @xmath1symplectic structures @xcite .",
    "a _ lie system _ is a system of first - order ordinary differential equations whose general solution can be expressed as a function , the _ superposition rule _ , of a generic finite collection of particular solutions and a set of constants . in contemporary geometric terms , the _ lie  scheffers theorem _",
    "@xcite asserts that a lie system is equivalent to a @xmath0-dependent vector field taking values in a finite - dimensional lie algebra of vector fields : a _ vessiot  guldberg lie algebra _ @xcite .",
    "this condition is so stringent that just few systems of differential equations can be regarded as lie systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , lie systems appear in relevant physical and mathematical problems and enjoy relevant geometric properties @xcite , which strongly prompt their analysis .    some attention has lately been paid to lie systems admitting a vessiot  guldberg lie algebra of hamiltonian vector fields with respect to several geometric structures @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , studying these particular types of lie systems led to investigate much more lie systems and applications than before . the first attempt in this direction was performed by marmo , cariena and grabowski @xcite , who briefly studied lie systems with vessiot  guldberg lie algebras of hamiltonian vector fields relative to a symplectic structure .",
    "this line of research was posteriorly followed by several researchers @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", it was fully established the general theory of lie systems admitting a vessiot  guldberg lie algebra of hamiltonian vector fields with respect to a poisson structure , the _ lie ",
    "hamilton systems_. for instance , this approach allows one to prove that the well - known invariant for riccati equations @xcite @xmath4 can be retrieved as a casimir element of a real lie algebra of hamiltonian functions @xcite .",
    "moreover , this work introduced the study of poisson co - algebra techniques to obtain superposition rules for these systems @xcite .    the _ no - go theorem for lie  hamilton systems _",
    "@xcite is a useful tool to establish when lie systems are not lie  hamilton ones .",
    "it has been employed to prove that relevant lie systems are not lie  hamilton systems . meanwhile ,",
    "many such systems admit vessiot  guldberg lie algebras of hamiltonian vector fields with respect to a dirac structure .",
    "this can be employed to generalize the techniques employed for lie ",
    "hamilton systems to a larger class of lie systems : the dirac  lie systems @xcite .    as a byproduct of studying dirac  lie systems , they appeared some lie systems that admit a vessiot  guldberg lie algebra with respect to several presymplectic structures .",
    "we here discover a new characteristic of many of these systems : the kernel of these presymplectic structures have trivial intersection , i.e. they form a @xmath1symplectic structure @xcite .",
    "such systems are relevant as they describe schwarzian equations @xcite and coupled riccati equations @xcite , which have applications in the theory of lie systems , classical mechanics and other fields @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the above mentioned property can also be found in many other lie systems , e.g. in lie systems for studying diffusion equations or control systems @xcite .",
    "this suggests us to define a new type of lie systems , the _ @xmath1symplectic lie systems _ , admitting vessiot  guldberg lie algebras of hamiltonian vector fields relative to the presymplectic forms of a @xmath1symplectic structure .",
    "the development of our new techniques to study @xmath1symplectic lie systems leads us to the definition and analysis of new geometric structures for @xmath1symplectic manifolds .",
    "we show that it is relevant , at least for our methods , to define generalisations of the usual structures of the symplectic geometry to the realm of @xmath1symplectic structures . in this way",
    ", we define the here called @xmath1symplectic hamiltonian functions and @xmath1symplectic vector fields .",
    "we construct certain poisson algebras related to @xmath1symplectic structures , the derived poisson algebras , which are a key to obtain superposition rules for @xmath1symplectic lie systems .",
    "this significantly improve and generalise a very few results given in @xcite and @xcite where analogous of our new structures , e.g. @xmath1symplectic hamiltonian functions , very briefly appear under other denominations .",
    "we have kept our terminology as we think that it reflects the fact that we are generalising presymplectic notions . moreover , our results are more general since , for instance , the @xmath1symplectic hamiltonian functions appearing in @xcite , the referred to as _ hamiltonian maps _ , are defined only for a certain type of @xmath1symplectic structures .",
    "more importantly , we show that these geometric structures play a relevant rle in the theory of lie systems , which fully justify their analysis .    at present , the @xmath1symplectic geometry is mainly applied to the study of first - order classical field theories . in particular , it allows us to give a geometric description of the euler  lagrange and the hamilton  de donder  weyl field equations , as well as the study of properties of these systems such as the study of constraints , symmetries , conservation laws , reduction , etcetera @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , we consider @xmath1symplectic structures for studying systems of differential equations , which opens a new setting of application of these geometrical structures .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath1symplectic lie systems can be considered as dirac  lie systems in several non - equivalent ways .",
    "this does not mean that @xmath1symplectic lie systems must be consider simply as dirac  lie systems .",
    "indeed , the techniques devised for @xmath1symplectic lie systems are more powerful since , roughly speaking , they permit us to use all these non - equivalent dirac  lie systems at the same time .",
    "for instance , we illustrate that a schwarzian equation @xcite can be studied as a @xmath1symplectic lie system or as a dirac  lie system in different manners .",
    "the @xmath1symplectic structure allows us to obtain simultaneously several constants of motion giving rise to a superposition rule for these differential equations .",
    "meanwhile , if we consider schwarzian equations as dirac  lie system , these constants of motion must be obtained separately using different geometric arguments .",
    "the structure of the paper goes as follows .",
    "section [ lsls ] concerns the description of the most basic notions to be used throughout our paper : @xmath0dependent vector fields , lie systems and @xmath1symplectic structures . in section [ nksls ]",
    "the analysis of several remarkable lie systems leads us to introduce the concept of a @xmath1symplectic lie system , which encompasses such systems as particular cases . as it can be difficult to determine whether a lie system is a @xmath1symplectic lie system ; we provide a no - go theorem to determine necessary conditions to be a @xmath1symplectic lie system in section [ nogo ] .",
    "sections [ oham ] and [ dpa ] are devoted to introducing some geometric structures which are employed to study @xmath1symplectic lie systems .",
    "in particular , in section [ oham ] we introduce the notion of @xmath5hamiltonian function as a generalisation of the hamiltonian function notion , and in section [ dpa ] we relate @xmath1symplectic structures to various poisson algebras : its derived poisson algebras .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath1symplectic lie ",
    "hamiltonian structures are introduced and analyzed in section [ hls ] and we analyse general properties of @xmath1symplectic lie systems in section [ ksls ] .",
    "section 9 is devoted to devising a method to calculate superposition rules for @xmath1symplectic lie systems .",
    "finally , section [ outlook ] summarizes our main results and present an outlook of our future research on these systems .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we assume all mathematical objects to be real , smooth , and globally defined . this enables us to skip minor technical problems so as to stress the main points of our theory .",
