    "various optical phenomena associated with the optical pumping process , which have been comprehensively studied since the 60 s and described in many aspects in a famous review @xcite by w.happer , is revived nowadays in a new form within the field of quantum information and quantum computing .",
    "the paramagnetic ground states of macroscopic atomic spin subsystems are considered now convenient physical objects for mapping and storing the quantum information in the quantum states of their collective angular momenta .",
    "the faraday - type interference scheme was proposed for spin squeezing @xcite and for quantum communication between atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "the proposed ideas were realized in spin squeezing @xcite and in the entanglement @xcite experiments , where a quantum measurement on the light forward - scattered from atomic ensembles was used .",
    "the same kind of off - resonant forward scattering combined with a quantum feedback was used in the recent demonstration of quantum memory for light @xcite .",
    "applications to various quantum information protocols including a cat state generation @xcite and quantum cloning of light onto atoms @xcite have been proposed .",
    "efficient generation of entanglement via multi - pass interaction have been also proposed @xcite .",
    "theoretical modelling in the above mentioned papers was concerned with collective canonical variables for atoms which can be conveniently introduced for spin @xmath0 atoms .",
    "however , the actual experiments were conducted using states with higher angular momenta . hence a theoretical model describing off - resonant interaction of light with realistic atoms with the angular momentum higher",
    "then @xmath0 is required .",
    "it is worth noting that the effect of a random faraday rotation due to atomic fluctuations was discussed and observed first in refs.@xcite more than twenty years ago in the context of demonstrating the advantages of light - beating method in atomic spectroscopy .",
    "the importance of atomic polarization was later discussed in refs.@xcite where it was shown that the collective spin polarization of an atomic ensemble could essentially modify the quantum statistics of the outgoing off - resonant probe radiation .",
    "quantum statistics of atomic spin variables was first experimentally observed via off - resonant forward scattering in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we develop the quantum theory of coherent forward scattering on an ensemble of polarized atoms with an arbitrary angular momentum .",
    "we discuss the physical conditions under which the forward scattering can be properly described in terms of the effective hamiltonian , generalizing the semiclassical approach @xcite , so that both the field and atomic subsystems are treated as quantum objects .",
    "based on the effective hamiltonian we derive the heisenberg - type equations of motion written for the spatial distribution of the stokes variables of the field and of the collective angular momentum of atoms .",
    "the solution shows how the entanglement of the quantum fluctuations of light and atomic subsystems is formed .",
    "we show that the entangling process can be understood in terms of a polariton - type spin wave induced in the atomic sample .",
    "we support our discussion by numerical simulations , assuming the conditions close to those of the recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we review the process of coherent forward scattering to show how the field heisenberg operators are transformed in interaction with multi - atom ensemble consisting of atoms with an arbitrary zeeman structure and for an off - resonant excitation on a dipole allowed optical transition . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we extend the heisenberg formalism to the atomic subsystem and introduce the effective hamiltonian responsible for the coupled dynamics of an infinite number of variables associated with the local polarization of the weak probe light and with individual atomic spins .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is further transformed in section [ s4 ] into another form by introducing the more convenient for the polarization sensitive processes irreducible tensor formalism . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we perform mesoscopic averaging to arrive at the wave - type equations for the collective quantum variables of the light and atomic subsystems .",
    "these equations are solved and discussed in section [ s6 ] in the context of the quantum entangling process .",
    "in particular they are used to test the applicability of the spin one - half approximation for modelling the quantum non - demolishing measurement in an ensemble of alkali atoms with a higher angular momentum .",
    "consider a system of @xmath1 identical atoms located in a finite volume and scattering coherent light of frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the wave of light incident on the atomic ensemble is assumed to be weak enough that possible saturation effects in its interaction with the atoms are negligible .",
    "the atomic ensemble , in general , represents an optically long ( thick in refraction , but thin in absorption ) medium for multiple off resonance scattering , but , on the average , the atoms are separated by distances much larger than the wavelength @xmath3 .",
    "thus each atom is located , on average , in the radiation zone of its neighbors .",
    "the interaction of the atoms with incident and multiply - scattered light is assumed to be of the dipole type and a proper description of multiple scattering has to be restricted to the rotating wave approximation .    to follow as clearly as possible the analogy between classical and quantum descriptions of the coherent forward scattering it seems convenient to solve the quantum problem in the heisenberg picture .",
    "in such an approach the basic process is the transformation of the electric field operators in a single scattering event .",
    "this process is reviewed in appendix [ s2.1 ] , as an example of the transformation of the operator of the free electric field of a moving atom . as shown there , the basic result can be written in terms of the heisenberg - type microscopic maxwell equation , where polarization response - operator is given by a single point - like scatterer .",
    "this allows us to make a subsequent generalization to the situation of an arbitrary number of atoms scattering light coherently in the forward direction .",
    "we begin our discussion from the single particle microscopic problem , described by equation ( [ 2.10])(see the appendix [ s2.1 ] for details ) . for a system of @xmath1",
    "identical scatterers randomly located in space it would be not so easy to generalize ( [ 2.10 ] ) to a multi - particle form allowing to follow precisely the heisenberg dynamics . for simplicity",
    "we restrict the discussion to the case of the plain incident wave , as in the experiments with gas cells @xcite . for a transparent medium consisting of @xmath1 scatterers light",
    "is scattered in any direction other than the forward direction only incoherently .",
    "this means that for optically thin and transparent medium the probability to observe a photon randomly scattered in any solid angle different from the direction of light propagation is just a sum of partial probabilities of independent scattering by each atom . in the heisenberg formalism",
    "this means that the non - forward propagating operator waves created in the medium by single or multiple scattering events are superposed with random phases to a roughly zero sum .",
    "the outgoing flux associated with incoherent scattering is proportional to the total number of atoms , but stays small because of a negligible value of the off - resonant cross section . at the same time for light propagating in the forward direction in transparent medium",
    "there is a very strong coherent enhancement of the scattering process .",
    "since the doppler shift in the forward scattered modes disappears , see ( [ 2.8 ] ) , and the raman shift , caused by zeeman splitting , does not noticeably change the phase of these modes , the transmitted light reveals strong coherent superposition of all partial contributions associated with single and multiple scattering . for discussion of the off - resonant light - atom coherent scattering beyond the plain wave approximation see @xcite .",
    "let us subdivide the joint dynamics of light and atomic subsystems into time increments , during which the number of accumulated incoherent scattering events is much less than the total number of atoms .",
    "this simplifies our analysis and allows to consider only the modes coherently scattered in the forward direction . in the examples we are going to discuss below this type of scattering",
    "is additionally stimulated by the propagating mode , which has the quasi - classical nature .",
    "within the rotating wave approximation we introduce a carrier frequency @xmath4 , coinciding with the average frequency of propagating light , and define an averaged wavenumber @xmath5 associated with the full set of the modes propagating in the @xmath6-direction .",
    "then the spectral bandwidth @xmath7 of the continuum of the field modes , contributing to the quantum operator expansion , should be chosen to be less than @xmath4 .",
    "the actual spectrum of the incident radiation , centered at @xmath4 , has a narrower bandwidth @xmath8 , which is much less than the detuning from the resonance @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the resonance frequency of the non - perturbed optical transition .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath11 is much greater than natural linewidth @xmath12 , doppler shift @xmath13 , and raman shift @xmath14 .",
    "we neglect the imaginary shift associated with the natural linewidth in the energy denominators . the dissipation process associated with the spontaneous decay",
    "is neglected in our discussion ; the assumptions justifying this are discussed in section [ s6.c ] . for an analysis of the role of spontaneous emission for off - resonant entangling interaction",
    "see @xcite .    under the above mentioned assumpltions the basic expression for the polarization of any @xmath15-th atom contributing to the forward scattering ( [ 2.15 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as follows @xmath16 where @xmath17is the polarizability tensor and @xmath18 is the crossection area of the light beam propagating through the medium in @xmath6-direction .",
    "other notations are specified in appendix [ s2.1 ] . expression ( [ 2.17 ] ) gives the instantaneous value of the polarizability tensor for @xmath15-th atom , which depends on its exact heisenberg evolution to the moment @xmath19 .",
    "the heisenberg operator of the electric field on the right hand side of equation ( [ 2.16 ] ) is assumed to be dressed in the perturbations by other atoms located in front of any selected @xmath15-th atom but non - perturbed by the selected atom itself .",
    "here we use cartesian coordinates in the tensor notation and sum over each repeated index .",
    "the indices @xmath20 take values @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "let us consider a thin mesoscopic layer located between @xmath6 and @xmath23 planes and containing a large number of atoms .",
    "such an atomic sub - ensemble will scatter incoming field coherently in the forward direction by the collective polarization @xmath24where @xmath6 coordinate is confined inside the layer @xmath25 . if the medium is split in a number of thin layers along the propagation direction the light beam would be subsequently scattered by this layers in the forward direction .",
    "then the `` coarse - grained '' dynamics of the field operators can be described by the following heisenberg - type macroscopic maxwell equation @xmath26where the polarization operator @xmath27 is subsequently given by expressions ( [ 2.16 ] ) - ( [ 2.18 ] ) .",
    "we conclude this section by the following remark . the derived macroscopic maxwell equation is coupled to the corresponding heisenberg equations governing the dynamics of the atomic subsystem ,",
    "see below , and it can not be extended up to an arbitrary time @xmath19 . its validity is restricted by ignoring the dissipation process of incoherent scattering .",
    "that is why the averaging of the operator polarizability ( [ 2.17 ] ) gives only the refraction part of the real polarizability tensor of normal maxwell equations .",
    "we will further discuss the self - consistency of the dynamical approach in section [ s6.c ] .",
    "in this section we discuss how the atomic variables are modified via the interaction with the forward propagating light .",
    "we describe the dynamics of slowly varying ground state operators , considering at first a single atom illuminated with an arbitrary quantized optical field .",
    "then we generalize the problem to a macroscopic ensemble and introduce atomic collective variables .",
    "consider an atom at the origin of the coordinate frame at the initial moment of time and drifting in space in such a way that during the scattering event it moves much less than a wavelength .",
    "let us define an arbitrary dyadic - type operator for the ground state of this atom @xmath28where by the second equality we specify the atomic state more precisely and introduce the atomic quantum numbers : @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the ground state angular momentum and its projections on the direction of an external magnetic field oriented along the @xmath31 axis , which in general is different from the direction of the light propagation .",
    "based on a perturbation theory we can expand the corresponding heisenberg operator up to the second order as follows @xmath32where @xmath33is the operator in the interaction representation and the second term @xmath34 \\right]% \\label{3.4}%\\end{aligned}\\]]is the second order correction induced by a dipole - type optical interaction , see ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "the integral ( [ 3.4 ] ) should be evaluated in the rotating wave approximation by keeping only the leading terms in the limit latexmath:[$t\\gg    products of the creation and annihilation field operators . in general such products",
    "expand over all the spatial modes , but in reality only those modes , which will not vanish after the averaging over the initial state , are important .",
    "these are planar modes propagating along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "taking into account only the propagating modes , the expansion ( [ 3.2 ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath36\\,+\\,\\ldots% \\label{3.5}%\\]]where we introduce an effective interaction hamiltonian in the interaction representation @xmath37 strictly speaking the electric field operators and the operator of the atomic polarizability tensor should be understood here as defined in the interaction representation and marked by the index zero .",
    "for the electric field these operators @xmath38 are given by the expansion ( [ 2.1 ] ) , defined at @xmath39 , where we keep only the forward propagating modes .",
    "the operator of the polarizability tensor @xmath40 is given by eq.([2.17 ] ) , transformed to the interaction representation , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the carrier frequency and wavenumber of the modes interacting with an atom .",
    "as in the eq.([2.16 ] ) the tensor indices inside the definition of the effective hamiltonian ( [ 3.6 ] ) can run only two projections either @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "note that in our derivation of the effective hamiltonian we used a rather short time increment @xmath19 consistent with the perturbation theory approach ; with the assumption that the atom does not noticeably change its location during the scattering event . then there would be no difference between the interaction and the heisenberg representations in the evaluation of the integral ( [ 3.4 ] ) and in introducing the effective hamiltonian ( [ 3.6 ] ) .",
    "based on a general principle of dynamical evolution we can straightforwardly generalize eq.([3.6 ] ) up to an arbitrary moment in time if we substitute there all the operators in the heisenberg representation .",
    "we should also take into account a classical drift of the atom in space and consider @xmath41 coordinate as its actual location at moment @xmath19 .",
    "consider now an ensemble consisting of many atoms scattering incident light coherently in the forward direction .",
    "although the most interesting polariton - type solutions obtained further in the paper are destroyed by atomic motion , we include the motion in our model for the sake of generality",
    ". however we ignore any possible correlations between their spatial motion and the internal state evolution .",
    "then each atom is in the environment of the field scattered by the atoms located in front of it and coupled with such a dressed field via the partial effective hamiltonian ( [ 3.6 ] ) .",
    "the full effective hamiltonian for the whole ensemble interacting with the propagating field in the heisenberg representation is given by @xmath42we preserve here the notation for the full effective hamiltonian , which was used in the previous equation in the case of one atom .",
    "then operator ( [ 3.1 ] ) considered for each atom of the ensemble satisfies the following heisenberg equation @xmath43% \\label{3.8}%\\ ] ] where @xmath44 .",
    "if we take into account the commutation relation between heiesenberg operators of the electric field propagating in the forward direction , which are given by @xmath45\\;=\\;% -\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar\\bar{\\omega}}{s_0}\\,\\delta_{ki}\\,\\delta(z'-z)% \\label{3.9}%\\]]then the maxwell equation ( [ 2.19 ] ) can be also rewritten in terms of the effective hamiltonian    @xmath46% \\label{3.10}%\\ ] ]    this operator equation shows that , in turn , the state of the field existing at each spatial point of the medium is defined by the atomic operators in the heisenberg representation , according to their spatial distribution in space at a given time @xmath19 .",
    "let us make the following remark concerning the definition of @xmath47-functions in ( [ 3.9 ] ) and in ( [ 2.16 ] ) and the validity of the dynamical equations in the form ( [ 3.10 ] ) .",
    "our description of the quasi - resonant radiation propagating in disordered medium in the forward direction is based on the rotating wave approximation . according to this approximation the spectral bandwidth of the field @xmath7",
    "is assumed to be at least less than carrier frequency @xmath4 .",
    "such a truncation of the infinite field continuum makes possible to consider the commutation relations of truly heisenberg operators in the form ( [ 3.9 ] ) .",
    "thus the @xmath47-functions here and in ( [ 2.16 ] ) should be correctly understood as distributed in a small mesoscopic area of the order @xmath48 .",
    "this spatial scale is obviously longer than @xmath3 but still much shorter than the sample size or than any internal macroscopic scale associated with macroscopic susceptibilities of the medium .",
    "it is also important to think about equations ( [ 3.10 ] ) as on approximation for more general multi - mode heisenberg - langevin type equation , where the damping processes associated with incoherent scattering would be taken into consideration . as was mentioned before , the validity of the output maxwell equations ( [ 2.19 ] ) , ( [ 3.10 ] ) is actually restricted by the narrow spectral domain @xmath8 associated with the spectrum of the probe light .",
    "but in the process of transposing the field operators by means of the commutation rule ( [ 3.9 ] ) the whole field spectrum @xmath7 should be taken into account .",
    "the coupled equations ( [ 3.8 ] ) and ( [ 3.10 ] ) considered together is the main result of this section .",
    "they reveal the joint dynamics of the field and atomic subsystems interacting in the limit of non - saturating off - resonant optical excitation . being an example of heisenberg equations they are valid for arbitrary initial quantum state of the field and of the atomic ensemble .",
    "the main restriction comes from the model of lossless coherent scattering .",
    "but even with such a simplification these equations are quite complicated since they are operator equations for an _ infinite number _ of the field and atomic variables . in the following sections we identify and discuss special conditions when equations ( [ 3.8 ] ) and ( [ 3.10 ] ) could be converted to a",
    "_ finite number _ of heisenberg - type equations for collective variables of the field and atomic subsystems .",
    "the set of dyadic - type operators ( [ 3.1 ] ) for each atom of the ensemble can be replaced with another set of operators @xmath49being the linear combination of original operators weighted with clebsh - gordan coefficients @xmath50 , the projectors @xmath51 become irreducible tensor operators , which possess the simplest properties with respect to rotational transformations , see @xcite .",
    "the linear transformations ( [ 4.1 ] ) are consistent with any coordinate frame .",
    "let us abandon the choice of the frame with @xmath31-axis along magnetic field , used in the basic definition ( [ 3.1 ] ) , and return to the original frame with the @xmath6-axis along the propagating beam , which is more natural for the further discussion of the effective hamiltonian approach .    for large frequency",

    "then the effective hamiltonian can be expressed as the sum of three terms @xmath55where dependence on time emphasizes that the contributing atom and field operators are taken in the heisenberg representation .    the first term in ( [ 4.2 ] ) couples the atomic population of the whole zeeman multiplet and their longitudinal alignment with the full photon flux of propagating light @xmath56\\;%",

    "this means that the first term in eq.([4.3 ] ) , i. e. the isotropic component of the effective hamiltonian , can be omitted in ( [ 4.17 ] ) since it commutes with all the stokes operators .    as follows from the derived equations the main obstacle on the way to convert the infinite number of operator equations to the system of truncated equations , written for the collective atomic variables , coupled with the integral or averaged field variables , comes from the spatial dependence of the interaction process .",
    "such a dependence is caused by anisotropic terms in the effective hamiltonian , which lead to spatially varying entanglement of different polarization modes of light with atomic spins along the propagation path .",
    "the spatial profile of the heisenberg - type stokes operators could be considered as uniform in @xmath93 component and as accumulating the collective fluctuations of atomic spins in complementary @xmath94 component only in one special case of a pure faraday effect . in this case",
    "the anisotropic components of the local susceptibilities of the medium would be zero on average and would exist as fluctuations acting only on the @xmath94 stokes component via random faraday rotation .",

    "one of the goals of this paper is to analyze the applicability of such approximation .    below we derive equations of motion in their general form and discuss their possible conversion to the finite number of wave - type equations written in terms of spatially distributed collective variables .",
    "as the most important practical example , we will further discuss the light propagation through atomic ensemble prepared originally in the coherent spin state , see figure [ fig.1 ] .",
    "we assume that atoms fill the cylindrical volume with the cross section @xmath18 coinciding with the cross section of the probe light beam .",

    "evaluation of the integrals ( [ 6.10 ] ) can be done numerically for any sample when all the external parameters are defined .",
    "let us briefly explain how the retardation effects can be taken into account . to do this",
    "the retardation time @xmath199 should be introduced as an independent variable for each spatial point @xmath6 at a certain moment of time @xmath19 .",
    "then the basic system ( [ 5.12 ] ) , where all the operators are considered now as functions of @xmath6 and @xmath200 , can be converted to the form ( [ 6.7 ] ) but with the derivative over retardation time on the left hand side .",
    "the initial conditions should be also modified and written for the initial retardation time @xmath201 , which corresponds now to spatially dependent moments in the laboratory time @xmath202 . as before we will assume that the wavefront of the probe radiation crosses @xmath155 point at zero time . in this case",
    "we need to know the cooperative atom - field dynamics at any spatial point @xmath6 only for time @xmath162 .",
    "then we may ignore the interaction hamiltonian for time @xmath203 and chose the initial conditions in ( [ 5.13 ] ) in the following form @xmath204there are no changes in the boundary conditions in ( [ 5.13 ] ) , since at @xmath155 the retardation time @xmath200 coincides with @xmath19 .",
    "thus in the most general case the solution ( [ 6.8])-([6.10 ] ) should be rewritten in terms of the retardation time and should depend on @xmath205 and @xmath206 as on initial quantum fluctuations of the atomic angular momenta .",
    "finally the retardation effects give us the following correction to the spatial and temporal dynamics of the field variables    @xmath207    and of the atomic variables @xmath208    these expressions can be applied for calculation of expectation values of any products of operators at a spatial point @xmath6 for the time @xmath162 .    an important feature of solutions ( [ 6.12 ] ) and ( [ 6.13 ] ) is their wave nature . as follows from the laplace transform carried out in the appendix [ b ] the eigenmodes of spatial and temporal distributions of atoms - field collective fluctuations",
    "are associated with the poles of determinant @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is defined by ( [ b.3 ] ) . for atoms with spin @xmath211",
    "this condition leads to @xmath212 and @xmath213 . in the absence of the magnetic field @xmath214",
    "there are only two collective modes associated with the total number of atoms and with the total number of scattering photons which undergo polarization sensitive interaction in the process of coherent forward scattering .",
    "this makes it possible to further simplify the effective hamiltonian and to discuss it in terms of integrated collective variables of the canonical type @xcite .",
    "however in a general case , due to presence of alignment associated effects , the condition @xmath209 gives coupled roots @xmath215 , i.e the wave - type modes which can survive in the sample and be excited by either time dependent fluctuations of the field stokes components or by spatial fluctuations of atomic spins .",
    "such quantum superposition of the field and material waves can be understood as a polariton - type spin wave generated in the medium .",
    "the multimode structure of such waves does not allow entanglement only between integrated collective variables . instead , in general the entanglement",
    "is distributed in all polariton modes . from the quantum information point of view",
    "this means that in the case of atoms with the ground state angular momentum equal or larger than @xmath216 a possible entanglement resource hidden in the polariton modes allows for multimode entanglement rather than a single mode entanglement available for spin one half systems .",
    "the quantum information then will be mapped on spatially dependent correlations of an atomic standing spin wave .    the following remark concerning the terminology is due here .",
    "let us point out the principle difference between the spin - wave dynamics described by eqs.(5.13 ) and the collective spin behavior in the spin - organized cold fermion gas , which was discussed years ago , see @xcite . in our case",
    "the cooperative dynamics of atomic spins is driven by the radiation - type interaction whereas in the cold fermionic systems it is driven by the static interparticle interaction via the longitudinal electric field .      in this section",
    "we concentrate on calculations relevant for the existing experimental example @xcite carried out with ensemble(s ) of @xmath179cs atoms .",
    "we first calculate the degree of spin squeezing ignoring the alignment , i.e. , following the model adopted in @xcite and describing the atomic ground state by the spin ( orientation ) only .",
    "we then present the numerical results including the alignment and show how this affects spin squeezing of atoms .    in the experiment @xcite the entanglement ( two mode squeezing )",
    "was generated between two spatially separated via a faraday - type detection of light . for pedagogical reasons we will make numerical simulations for the case of single mode spin squeezing , which makes no difference for the present discussion .",
    "we will completely ignore the retardation effects and consider the spin dynamics without external magnetic field .",
