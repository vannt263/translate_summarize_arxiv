    "the on demand generation of optical single photons on a chip is one of the most challenging and required results for the successful implementation of quantum information devices .",
    "many proposal for the production of single optical photons have been described and realized in the last decades .",
    "early experiments demonstrated photon generation from single ions @xcite , atoms @xcite , and molecules @xcite .",
    "the challenges involved in overcoming the practical difficulties in isolating single particles make their use as single photon sources very demanding .",
    "the first demonstration of stable , triggered , room temperature single - photon source was made using a nickel nitrogen defect @xcite .",
    "another alternative is to use quantum dots @xcite , though radiation in all directions makes efficient collection difficult .",
    "it is also possible to use twin photons produced in parametric down - conversion to generate a heralded source of single photons , heralded meaning that the single pohoton state is conditional on the detection of the other photon of the pair .",
    "the production of 1550 nm wavelength photons in this way was reported @xcite .",
    "perhaps one of the largest disadvantages of the single - photon sources described so far is that the emission is random .",
    "it is not possible to tell if a particular excitation pulse has generated a single - photon emission until that single photon is detected .",
    "a true resource for quantum information on a chip is the mapping of qubit states onto microwave photon states .",
    "these photons are generated on - demand with a high repetition rate , high efficiency , and good spectral purity @xcite .",
    "the recent production of single microwave photons , and superpositions of photon states into an lc resonator from a superconducting flux qubit @xcite , and the creation of a microwave photon counter @xcite are important steps towards on - chip quantum optics experiments .    in this work",
    "we will show instead that the single microwave photon generated on - demand in superconducting cavities can be teleported with high fidelity into a single photon at optical wavelength exploiting the entanglement between the output radiation mediated by a mechanical resonator .",
    "entanglement is the property possessed by a multipartite quantum system when it is in a state that can not be factorized into a product of states or a mixture of such products . in an entangled state the various parties share nonclassical and possibly non - local correlations , that are at the heart of counter intuitive quantum phenomenon .",
    "recently , wide range of experimental and theoretical schemes have been proposed to observe entanglement also in macroscopic objects @xcite , for example , the proposed entanglement of two mirrors of a ring cavity by using the radiation pressure of the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "subsequently , different schemes have been proposed to entangle of nano- and micro mechanical resonators with macroscopic and microscopic systems . such as the entanglement of a nanomechanical resonator with a cooper pair box @xcite , or an optical mode @xcite , for entangling two charge qubits @xcite or two josephson junctions @xcite via nanomechanical resonators , and for entangling two nanomechanical resonators via trapped ions @xcite or cooper pair boxes @xcite .",
    "owing to the recent improvements in nanofabrication techniques a new scheme for entangling a nano - mechanical resonator with the microwave field of a superconducting coplanar waveguide field , without the mediation of a cooper pair box , was proposed @xcite . in particular , this continuous - variable ( cv ) entanglement can be used to teleport an unknown quantum state .",
    "quantum teleportation @xcite is the transfer of an unknown quantum state from a sender ( alice ) to a receiver ( bob ) by means of the entanglement shared by the two parties and appropriate classical communication .",
    "the teleportation is perfect and bob recovers an exact copy of the state teleported to him by alice only if the quantum channel is an ideal maximally entangled state . if we deal with qubits represented by polarization states of photons , then we can employ pair of polarization entangled photons generated by means of spontaneous parametric down - conversion , wherein the entanglement is almost perfect @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of continuous quantum variables @xcite , an ideal channel is an unphysical infinitely squeezed state . in quantum optics , by considering the finite quantum correlations between the quadratures in a two - mode squeezed state , braunstein and kimble @xcite proposed a realistic protocol employing a beam splitter and homodyne measurements , which approaches perfect teleportation in the limit of infinite degree of squeezing .",
    "this teleportation was first realized in ref .",
    "@xcite using a gaussian coherent state then was successfully extended to a non - gaussian state in ref .",
    "@xcite    in ref.@xcite we proposed a specific optomechanical system for the teleportation of schrdingers - cat states . in the present paper",
    "we show how a cv quantum teleportation protocol can be implemented in the same optomechanical system for realizing the teleportation of a single photon state and even of a coherent superposition of number states from microwave to optical frequencies . combining this scheme with the demonstrated ability to generate on demand single microwave photons",
    ", we could realise a deterministic source of single optical photons .",
    "we consider a hybrid , strongly quantum - correlated system formed by a microwave cavity ( mc ) coupled to a high - finesse optical cavity ( oc ) via a vibrating micro cantilever . the microwave cavity mode is indirectly coupled to an optical cavity mode via the common interaction with the vibrating micro mechanical resonator @xcite .",
    "we show that with the current scheme , it is possible to generate a reversible stationary cv entanglement between the output fields of optical and microwave resonators , which gives a realistic device capable of cv quantum teleportation for non - gaussian single photon states and even the coherent superposition of two different photon number states .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we shortly describe the proposed system @xcite and derive the quantum langevin equations ( qles ) . in sec . 3 ,",
    "the linearization of qles around the semiclassical steady state is discussed and we quantify the entanglement between the output of optical mode and the output of microwave field by using the logarithmic negativity . in sec .",
    "4 , the fidelity of the teleportation is studied , while conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the system studied in this work is sketched in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we assume a mechanical resonator ( mr ) which on one side is capacitively coupled to a driven superconducting mc of resonant frequency @xmath2 , and on the other side it is coupled to a driven oc with resonant frequency @xmath3 . such a system might be possible using the lumped - element superconducting resonator with free standing drum - head capacitor recently developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact , by adding an optical coating , the drum - head capacitor could also play the role of the reflecting micro - mirror of a fabry - perot optical cavity formed by a second standard input mirror .",

    "the two outputs of the beam splitter are then subject to a homodyne measurement , using two iq mixers , with a pulsed local oscillator mode matched to the single photon source cavity .",
    "the integrated homodyne current then produces two measurement results , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "currently the quantum efficiency of the homodyne measurement is not high due to the need to amplify the signal prior to using the iq mixer however the use of phase dependent amplifiers , such as josephson parametric amplifiers , should improve the quantum efficiency @xcite .",
    "these results are then passed through a classical channel to alice who completes the protocol by implementing conditional displacements of her component of the shared entangled beams .",
    "these displacements will need to be done using a pulsed local oscillator synchronous with and phase locked to that used for the microwave measurements at bob s station . upon receiving this information",

    "<S> the micro - mechanical resonator on one side is capacitively coupled to the microwave cavity and on the other side is coupled to a high finesses optical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we then show how this continuous variable entanglement can be profitably used to teleport the non - gaussian number state @xmath0 and the superposition @xmath1 from the microwave cavity output mode onto an output of optical cavity mode with fidelity much larger than the no - cloning limit . </S>"
