    "hd 30963 ( v = 7.23 mag ) , currently assigned an b9 iii spectral type , is one of the slowly rotating late b we are currently observing .",
    "this star has been little studied : one only finds 10 references in simbad for hd 30963 . the incentive of this project is to reclassify the late b stars in the northern hemisphere brighter than v=7.5 mag with low apparent projected velocities ( less than 60 @xmath0 ) .",
    "we have previously undertaken a similar survey of the slowly rotating early a stars,.whose results are published in @xcite . an abundance analysis of high resolution well exposed spectra of these objects has sorted out the sample into 17 chemically normal stars ( ie .",
    "whose abundances do not depart more than @xmath1 0.20 dex from solar values ) , 12 spectroscopic binaries and 13 chemically peculiar stars ( cp ) . among the new cp stars , @xcite and @xcite have identified 5 new hgmn stars .",
    "we present here new abundance determinations for hd 30963 , a slowly rotating late b star and show that this star is another new hgmn late b star .",
    "hd 30963 has been observed on five consecutive days at observatoire de haute provence ( ohp ) using sophie in its high resolution mode ( r=75000 ) in november and december 2015 .",
    "a log of the observations appears in tab .",
    "four 1800 s and one 2400 seconds exposures were obtained with a signal - to - noise ratio varying from 78 up to 167 . as we do not see conspicuous radial velocity variations on these spectra taken over five days , we have shifted all spectra onto a common wavelength scale ( that of the first spectrum ) and we have coadded the individual spectra into a mean spectrum .. assuming a radius for hd 30963 of about 3 to 4 @xmath2 and using the @xmath3 of @xcite , we derive an upper limit of 4.12 days for the rotational period of hd 30963 .",
    "the observations we secured over 5 days separated by about 24 hours each therefore cover the rotational period of hd 30963 .",

    "the following spectral regions have been used to readdress the spectral type of hd 30963 .",
    "first , the red wing of @xmath4 from 3980   up to 4000",
    "  harbours the hg ii line at 3984   and two zr ii and one y ii lines likely to be strengthened in a late b - type star of the hgmn type ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "second , the region from 4470   to 4490   contains the mg ii triplet near 4481.15  , the he i line at 4471.48   and the mn ii line at 4478.64 (fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . we have also looked for peculiarities in the ni ii line at 4067.04   and the sr ii resonance line at 4077.70   and in the pt ii line at 4514.17   and the ba ii resonance line at 4554.01  .",

    "the effective temperature @xmath6 and surface gravity @xmath7 of hd 30963 were taken from @xcite survey of field b stars .",
    "these authors have derived @xmath8 k and @xmath9 by adjusting the observed @xmath10 profile of hd 30963 to grids of synthetic spectra .",
    "a 72 layers plane parallel model atmosphere assuming radiative equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium has been first computed for these values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 using the atlas9 code @xcite , specifically the linux version using the new odfs maintained by f. castelli on her website .",
    "the linelist was built starting from kurucz s ( 1992 ) gfhyperall.dat file which includes hyperfine splitting levels .",
    "this first linelist was then upgraded using the nist atomic spectra database and the vald database operated at uppsala university @xcite .",
    "a grid of synthetic spectra was then computed with synspec48 @xcite to model the eleven lines listed in table 1 adopting a null microturbulent velocity .",
    "the synthetic spectra were further convolved using the routine rotin3 provided along with synspec48 using @xmath11 @xmath0 @xcite and he appropriate fwhm for sophie .",
    "the unknown abundance @xmath12 $ ] was varied until minimisation of the chi - square between the observed and synthetic spectrum .",

    "larger than 50 times the solar values the synthesis of the mn ii line at 4478.64   in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] yields an overabundance of 50 times the solar abundance .",
    "this is a substantial excess and it may be revised to a lower value when we will model mn ii lines having atomic data for several isotopes and hyperfine structure . the hg overabundance is derived from the synthesis of 11 transitions next to 3983.84   representing the hyperfine structure of various isotopes of hg in a similar manner as @xcite modeled hd 175640 . the abundance that best fits",
    "the observed line profile is very large ( 150000 @xmath5 ) as can be seen in fig .",
    "this is one of the strongest hg excess we found in the new hgmn stars @xcite .",
    "the abundance of zr derived from the 2 lines in table 1 is about 150 @xmath5 .",
    "the yttrium abundance derived from y ii 3932.44    is also very important ( 1000 @xmath5 ) . while modeling the fe ii lines in the 4500 - 4600  region , we noticed a 1.5 % feature at about 4514.15   which we identify as one of the strongest pt ii line expected at 4514.17   listed in vald .",
    "no other `` easier '' identification ( ie . in terms of a lighter element ) can reproduce the observed line depth at this wavelength .",
    "we are currently looking for other lines of pt ii lines at shorter wavelengths to confirm the presence of platinum in hd 30963 .",
    "we also checked that a model computed for a solar platinum abundance ( and without the pt ii line ) yields no absorption at all at 4514.17  . from the 4514.17   line only ,",
    "a provisional excess of platinum is derived to be about 2500 @xmath5 .",
    "we also find considerable deficiencies in he ( 0.2 @xmath5 ) and ni ( 0.1 @xmath5 ) .",
    "the excesses in mn , y , zr , pt and hg and the deficiencies in he and ni are characteristic of an hgmn star .",
    "whereas it was up to now classified as a normal late b9 iii star , our analysis of hd 30963 shows that it has very peculiar over and underabundances .",
    "the overabundances in mn , sr , y , zr , pt and hg are characteristic of an hgmn star .",
    "it displays large overabundances of the sr , y and zr triad which is however inverted compared to the solar system triad .",
    "the synthesis of the hg ii and pt ii lines reveals large overabundances of pt and hg . we are currently performing a detailed abundance analysis of hd 30963 to complement the first abundances presented here .",
    "the authors acknowledge the efficient help of the night assistants at observatoire de haute provence .",
