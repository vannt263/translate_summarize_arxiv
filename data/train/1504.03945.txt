    "white dwarf stars are the most common stellar evolutionary endpoint .",
    "all stars with initial masses up to @xmath6 ( smartt 2009 , doherty et al .",
    "2014 ) , more than 97% of the stars in the galaxy , end their lives as white dwarf stars . their evolution can be described as a simple and slow cooling process . because white dwarf star are abundant and long - lived objects they convey important information about the properties of all galactic populations ( isern et al .",
    "2001 ; liebertet al . 2005 ; bono et al .",
    "in particular , white dwarf stars can be considered as reliable cosmic clocks to infer the age of a wide variety of stellar populations , such as the galactic disks and halo ( winget et al .",
    "1987 ; garca - berro et al . 1988ab , isern et",
    "al 1998 ; torres et al .",
    "2002 ) , and globular and open clusters ( kalirai et al . 2001 ; hansen et al .",
    "2002 , 2007 ; kalirai 2013 ) .",
    "methods for determining stellar population ages from their white dwarf cooling sequences are usually based on the comparison of either the observed white dwarf luminosity function ( winget et al . 1987 , bedin et al . 2010 , garca - berro et al . 2014 ) , or the distribution in the color  magnitude diagram , with theoretical computations ( see e.g. hansen et al .",
    "both techniques rely on the use of extensive grids of white dwarf cooling sequences .",
    "however , the evolutionary stages prior to the final cooling curve must be taken into account .",
    "in particular , a connection between the properties of the white dwarfs with those of their main sequence progenitors is the initial - to - final mass relation ( ifmr ) .",
    "this relation can be applied to study the chemical evolution of galaxies , including the enrichment of the interstellar medium , and the chemical evolution history of stellar populations in general . at the high mass end",
    ", the white dwarf ifmr can lead to constraints on the critical mass that separates white dwarf production from type ii supernova explosions , and at the low mass end , the relation represents a tool to probe the progenitor properties of most of the evolved stars in old stellar populations , the majority of which are now low - mass white dwarf stars .",
    "the study of the ifmr started with the work of weidemann ( 1977 ) who compared theoretical models of mass loss to the observed masses of a few white dwarfs in nearby stellar clusters .",
    "this semi - empirical approach was followed by other authors .",
    "more recently , cataln et al .",
    "( 2008a ) obtained a semi - empirical ifmr by re - evaluating the available data , that includes observations from individual stars from open clusters and common proper motion pairs .",
    "kalirai et al .",
    "( 2008 ) increased the observations and included data from two open clusters older than @xmath7 1 gyr and from the old open cluster ngc 6791 , extending the initial mass range down to 1.16@xmath8 .",
    "finally , kalirai ( 2013 ) presented an ifmr based on spectroscopic observations of white dwarfs belonging to open and globular clusters and sirius b ( see e.g. kalirai et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 , 2009 ) , with initial mass ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10",
    ". in particular , kalirai et al . (",
    "2008 ) bin the relation so that each star cluster was represented by a single point .    in the last few years",
    ", the amount of data available has increased considerably . in the galactic field ,",
    "the sloan digital sky survey increased the total number of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs stars to @xmath11 ( kleinmann et al .",
    "2013 , kepler et al .",
    "2014 ) . in the galactic halo , recent hubble space telescope observations of the globular clusters m4 ( richer et al . 2004",
    "; hansen et al . 2004 ; bedin et al . 2009 ) , @xmath12 cen ( monelli et al . 2005 ) , ngc 6397 ( richer et al . 2006 ; hansen et al . 2007 ) and 47 tuc ( hansen et al . 2013 ) have similarly uncovered several hundreds of cluster white dwarfs . in all cases ,",
    "the white dwarf samples are dominated by low mass stars . with the increase of the available data ,",
    "the general trend in the empirical ifmr remains .",
    "however , the scatter in the data has increased , possibly due to a correlation between the mass loss rates and the properties of the host environment .",
    "although this scatter could be related to other properties as rotation , binary evolution and the presence of magnetic fields ( weidemann 2000 ) , it is more likely produced by differences in the chemical composition , i.e. different metallicity values ( kalirai et al .",
    "2008 ) .    to estimate the age of a given stellar population ,",
    "the metallicity of the environment has to be taken into account .",
    "as it is well known , for a fixed initial mass , the lifetime of a star decreases with the metallicity , since less metallic  lower opacity  envelopes leads to higher luminosities . on the other hand , an increase on metallicity leads to an enhanced mass loss during the giant phases of the evolution , resulting in lower final masses .",
    "in addition , other parameter characterizing white dwarf stars are expected to depend on metallicity .",
    "for instance , the amount of hydrogen left on a white dwarf star decreases for higher metallicity values ( see e.g. renedo et al .",
    "also , a reduction of the initial metallicity tends to reduce the degree of chemical stratification in the central regions , which translates in a lower oxygen abundance at the center ( dominguez et al .",
    ". this will affect the cooling rates , and in particular , the amount of energy released by the crystallization process at @xmath13 k.    in this work we focus on the study of the effects of different metallicity values on the ifmr and on the lifetimes during the cooling sequences and its previous evolutionary stages .",
    "specifically we center our analysis on the low and intermediate mass end of the ifmr , by considering masses ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath4 at the main sequence . to this end",
    "we compute full evolutionary sequences from the zero age main sequence ( zams ) , through the central stable hydrogen and helium central burning , the thermally pulsing and mass - loss phases on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and finally to the white dwarf cooling phase .",
    "the computations were performed with the lpcode evolutionary code ( althaus et al .",
    "we consider 7 metallicity values ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , covering the values for halo and disk populations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ numerical ] is devoted to present the input physics considered in the evolutionary computations . in section",
    "[ parameters ] we present our model grid and discuss the influence of metallicity on the pre - white dwarf evolution .",
    "we explore the influence of metallicity on the minimum mass to reach helium burning at the beginning of the horizontal branch phase and the core mass growth during the tp - agb phase . in section [ i - f ]",
    "we present and discuss our results for the theoretical ifmr for the different metallicity values and compare them with the observational data from open and globular clusters .",

    "we present our concluding remarks in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the evolutionary computations presented in this work were calculated with an updated version of the lpcode evolutionary code .",
    "the details on the code can be found in althaus et al .",
    "( 2005a , 2010 ) , renedo et al . ( 2010 ) and romero et al .",
    "the lpcode evolutionary code computes the complete evolution from the zams , through the hydrogen and helium burning stages , the thermally pulsating and mass loss stages on the asymptotic giant branch , to the white dwarf cooling evolution .",
    "this code has been used to produce very accurate white dwarf models ( see garca - berro et al . 2010 ; althaus et al .",
    "2010 ; renedo et al .",
    "2010 and reference therein ) .",
    "the code has also been used to study the formation of extreme horizontal branch stars ( miller bertolami et al .",
    "2008 ) , the evolution of extremely low mass white dwarf stars ( althaus et al . 2013 ) , and also the role of thermohaline mixing for the surface composition of low - mass red giants ( wachlin et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the lpcode considers simultaneous treatment of non - instantaneous mixing and burning of elements ( althaus et al .",

    "in particular , the @xmath16c@xmath17o reaction rate , of special relevance for the carbon@xmath0oxygen stratification of the resulting white dwarf , was taken from angulo et al .",

    "( 2005 ) and weiss & ferguson ( 2009 ) . in lpcode",
    "molecular opacities are computed adopting the opacity tables with the correct abundances of the unenhanced metals and the appropriate carbon - oxygen ratio . for the present computations , we have not considered carbon - enriched molecular opacities ( marigo 2002 ) , which are expected to reduce effective temperatures at the agb ( wiess & ferguson 2009 ) .",

    "prior to the thermally pulsing agb phase , we allow the occurrence of extra@xmath0mixing episodes beyond each convective boundary following the prescription of herwig et al . ( 1997 ) . note that the occurrence of extra@xmath0mixing episodes during the core helium burning phase largely determines the final chemical composition of the core of the resulting white dwarf star ( prada moroni & straniero 2002 , straniero et al .",
    "we treated the extra@xmath0mixing as a time - dependent diffusion process , assuming that the mixing velocities decay exponentially beyond each convective boundary .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the pressure scale height at the convective boundary , @xmath26 is the diffusion coefficient of unstable regions close to the convective boundary , and @xmath27 is the geometric distance from the edge of the convective boundary ( herwig et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "the free parameter @xmath28 describes the efficiency of the extra@xmath0mixing process .",
    "it can take values as high as @xmath29 , for over - adiabatic convective envelopes of da white dwarfs ( freytag et .",
    "al 1996 ) .",
    "however , for deep envelope and core convection @xmath28 is expected to be considerably smaller because the ratio of the brunt@xmath0visl timescales of the stable to unstable layers decreases with depth .",
    "we assume @xmath30 , which accounts for the location of the upper envelope on the main sequence for a large sample of clusters and associations ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 , herwig et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "the same value accounts for the intershell abundances of hydrogen@xmath0deficient post@xmath0agb remnants ( see herwig et al .",
    "1997 ; herwig 2000 ; mazzitelli et al .",
    "finally , for the mass range considered in this work , the mass of the outer convection zone on the tip of the rgb only increases by @xmath31 if we change the parameter @xmath28 by a factor of two .",
    "the breathing pulse instability occurring towards the end of the core helium burning is attributed to the adopted algorithm rather than to the physics of convection and therefore were suppressed in our computations ( see straniero et al .",
    "2003 for a detailed discussion ) .    during the thermally pulsing agb phase , extra@xmath0mixing episodes were disregarded .",
    "this may prevent the third dredge@xmath0up to occur in low mass stars .",
    "in particular , a strong reduction of extra@xmath0mixing episodes at the base of the pulse - driven convection zone seems to be supported by simulations of the @xmath32process abundance patterns ( lugaro et al .",
    "2003 ) and by observational inferences of the ifmr ( salaris et al .",
    "2009 ) . as a consequence",
    ", we expect that the mass of the hydrogen free core to gradually increase as evolution proceeds during this stage .",
    "kalirai et al .",
    "( 2014 ) estimated a growth of the core mass on the tp - agb to be between 10% and 30% for initial masses between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , that decreases steadily to @xmath35% at @xmath36 .",
    "however , third - dredge  up episodes are not completely suppressed in our models . in particular , the two more massive sequences for @xmath2 , those with initial masses 2.0 and 2.5 @xmath8 do experience dredge  up episodes during the tp - agb .",
    "we will comment on the effect of third dredge  up episodes on our determination of the final masses in section [ agb ] .",
    "in addition , the suppression of dredge  up episodes in our models prevents the formation of carbon rich stars , i.e , the c / o ratio remains below unity during all the tp - agb stage .",
    "mass loss was considered during red giant branch and core helium burning phases following schreder & cuntz ( 2005 ) .",
    "this mass@xmath0loss rate is based on the reimers formula @xmath37 ( reimers 1975 ) , but it contains two additional factors , one depending on the surface temperature and the other on the surface gravity of the star .",
    "this improves the agreement with the observed mass@xmath0loss rates for different types of stars , without the need to adjust the fitting parameter @xmath38 ( shreder & cuntz 2005 ) .",
    "we set @xmath39 , that satisfies the well constrained rgb mass loss of globular cluster stars .    during the agb and tp - agb phases ,",
    "we employ the prescriptions of groenewegen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) for low and high metallicity sequences , respectively .",
    "the mass loss prescription presented by vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) for the tp - agb phase is pulsation dependent , with an exponentially increasing rate for periods less than @xmath40 days and a constant superwind phase for periods beyond @xmath40 days , corresponding to a radiation@xmath0pressure driven wind .",
    "this prescription , or an updated version , is usually adopted to model the mass loss during the tp - agb stage in evolutionary computations ( e.g. renedo et al . 2010 , karakas & lattanzio 2007 , karakas 2010 , marigo & girardi 2007 ) . in particular ,",

    "( 2014 ) employed the mass@xmath0loss rate prescription of vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) to determine the ifmr of intermediate mass stars with initial masses between 5.0 and 10.0 @xmath8 for metallicities spanning the range of @xmath41 .",
    "groenewegen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented a mass loss prescription based on data of resolved stars on the small and large magellanic clouds obtained with spitzer irs that represents low metallicity populations .",
    "they found that , even when the vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) models described the data better , there are some deficiencies , in particular the maximum adopted mass@xmath0loss rate",
    ". the assumption of typical velocities and dust - to - gas ratios of galactic stars may lead to an overestimate of the mass@xmath0loss rate .",

    "for instance , element diffusion strongly modifies the chemical composition profile throughout the outer layers .",
    "indeed , our sequences developed a pure hydrogen envelope with increasing thickness as evolution proceeds .",
    "our treatment of time@xmath0dependent diffusion is based on the multicomponent gas treatment presented in burgers ( 1969 ) .",

    "the metal mass fraction in the envelope is not fixed , but it is computed consistently according to the predictions of element diffusion . to account for the different envelope compositions , we considered radiative opacity tables from opal for arbitrary metallicities . for effective temperatures",
    "less than @xmath53 k we include the effects of molecular opacity from the computations of marigo & aringer ( 2009 ) .",
    "in addition , we considered the chemical rehomogenization of the inner carbon@xmath0oxygen profile induced by rayleigh@xmath0taylor instabilities following salaris et al .",
    "for effective temperatures below @xmath53 k , outer boundary conditions are derived from non@xmath0gray model atmospheres ( rohrmann et al .",
    "the equation of state is that of segretain et al .",

    "finally , cool white dwarf stars are expected to undergo crystallization as a result of strong coulomb interactions in their dense interiors ( van horn 1968 ) .",
    "crystallization occurs when the energy of the coulomb interaction between neighboring ions is much larger than their thermal energy .",
    "this process leads to the release of latent heat and of gravitational energy associated with changes in the chemical composition of carbon@xmath0oxygen profile ( garca@xmath0berro et al .",
    "these additional energy sources associated with crystallization were included self - consistently , modifying the luminosity equation to account for both the local contribution of energy released from the core chemical redistribution and the latent heat , the later being of the order of @xmath54 per ion . to asses the enhancement of oxygen in the crystallized core we used the phase diagram presented in horowitz et al .",

    "2009 ) , so we use a metallicity value of @xmath92 for this cluster .",
    "hansen et al .",
    "( 2013 ) determine a cluster age by fitting the properties of the cluster white dwarf population .",
    "they derived a total age of 9.9@xmath780.7 gyr at 95% confidence . from our computations we found that the sequence characterized by a white dwarf mass of @xmath93 has not reached the crystallization temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ cooling ] ) while all sequences with white dwarf mass @xmath94 , and progenitor mass of @xmath95 , have a partially crystallized core at 10 gyr .",
    "finally the white dwarf stars at high luminosity in the cooling curve are characterized by an stellar mass around @xmath96 corresponding to progenitors with @xmath97 .",
    "summarizing , the stellar mass values of the white dwarf stars at high luminosities derived for the three globular clusters are very similar , around @xmath98 , in agreement with previous estimates .",
    "nevertheless , the progenitor mass at the zams changes with metallicity .",
    "the progenitor mass for ngc 6397 is around @xmath99 , while for m4 is @xmath100 . since the total ages for these two systems are basically the same , within the uncertainties , the initial mass differences are a consequence of the different characteristic metallicities .",
    "47 tuc is younger than ngc 6397 and m4 by @xmath101 gyr and thus the mass of the main sequence is larger ( @xmath102 ) , as expected .",
    "however the stellar mass at high luminosities in the white dwarf cooling sequences is the lowest of the sample , indicating an enhanced mass loss rate , associated also to the higher metallicity .",
    "in this work we studied the impact of metallicity on the theoretical white dwarf models , considering also its influence on the previous stages of evolution through the analysis of the ifmr and the evolutionary lifetimes .",
    "to this end we compute a grid of full evolutionary sequences characterized by metallicity values for the progenitor stars between @xmath2 and 0.04 , covering the @xmath45 range observed on the galactic disk and halo populations .",
    "we focused on stars with initial masses ranging from @xmath99 to @xmath103 , giving rise to white dwarf stellar masses in the range between @xmath104 @xmath105 .",
    "our main results are the following :    * from our theoretical evolutionary computations , we found that the ifmr shows a dependence with the initial metallicity : the stellar mass of the remnant on the white dwarf colling curve decreases as the initial metallicity increases , indicating an strong influence of the metallicity on the mass loss rates during the rgb and the agb phases .",
    "our results are in good agreement with observations and semi empirical estimations of the ifmr , showing that the spread observed in the semi empirical data can be explain by means of the different metal abundances . + our analysis on the ifmr does not include the effect of extra  mixing episodes during the tp - agb evolution .",
    "then for most sequences dredge  up episodes , and its effects on the effective temperature , mass@xmath0loss rate , and core mass growth during the tp - agb evolution , are not present .",
    "it follows that the dependence of the ifmr is explored mainly under the conditions of fixed initial metallicity , and photospheric c / o ratio below unity during the tp - agb phase , and thus no c  rich stars are formed from our models , except for sequences with high initial mass and metallicity @xmath2 .",
    "* the mass of the helium core at the beginning of the central helium burning is smaller for more metal rich models .",
    "this will strongly influence the determination of the inner chemical composition of white dwarf stars with stellar mass @xmath106 . finally , the minimum mass for a star to undergo a helium flash decreases with metallicity . *",
    "we confirm the dependence with metallicity of the hydrogen mass left at a white dwarf star , being in general thinner for models with higher @xmath45 progenitors .",
    "* we found that as the metallicity increases the pre - white dwarf lifetimes also increases , with age differences up to @xmath107 gyr for a @xmath108 star .",
    "then , in order to estimate the age of a stellar population or a single object properly , we not only need to consider the total pre - white dwarf lifetime but also we must take into account its characteristic metal content .",
    "* finally we employed our evolutionary computations to study three old globular clusters characterized with very different metallicity values : ngc 6397 ( @xmath2 ) , m4 ( @xmath61 ) and 47 tuc ( @xmath92 ) . by taking the age determinations from the literature , we estimate the mass of the white dwarf at high luminosities and the corresponding mass of the progenitor star , employing the ifmr with the corresponding @xmath45 value .",
    "we found that all three clusters have a similar white dwarf mass at high luminosities ( @xmath109 ) , in agreement with previous estimates .",
    "however , the initial mass values are different , being larger for 47 tuc .",
    "this result is an indication of the dependence of ifmr with the metallicity .    in future",
    "works an extension to higher initial masses should be performed , from the theoretical point of view in order to study younger stellar populations , as open clusters .",
    "also , this could be used to constrain the free parameters governing the theoretical mass loss rates that are currently used in stellar evolutionary computations .",
