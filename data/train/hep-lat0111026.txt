    "this review will start with a sketch of the kinematical - algebraic aspects of the overlap dirac operator in the vector - like context .",
    "next comes a general discussion of numerical implementations of the overlap dirac operator .",
    "section 2 is devoted to an alternative domain wall model .",
    "this model is domain - wall like in the sense that an extra dimension is added and the computation of the light fermion propagator requires a single conjugate gradient procedure , albeit for a matrix representing fermions in five dimensions . on the other hand ,",
    "the model is designed so that its output in exact arithmetic is the same as that of an iterative method implementing the overlap dirac operator directly .",
    "the latter method requires a two - level nested conjugate gradient procedure . in section 3",
    "rigorous results on spectral properties of our model are presented and in section 4 these results are compared to true domain wall fermions .",
    "the main conclusion is that nested procedures typically are more efficient than implementations based on domain - walls .",
    "this counter - intuitive conclusion is explained by the condition number of the domain wall problem being the product of the condition number of the four dimensional problem by the inverse bare quark mass .",
    "the latter two factors govern individually the two nested cycles in direct implementations . in section 5",
    "it is shown that one can eliminate the requirement of linearly growing memory consumption for increasing accuracy at the cost of a factor of two in operations . in practice ,",
    "the factor of two is often not felt because the implementation is memory bound .",
    "section 6 contains some final comments .",
    "a large part of this talk is about work done in collaboration with rajamani narayanan  @xcite .",
    "the overlap formulation  @xcite of vector - like gauge theories on the lattice preserves chiral symmetries exactly , a property thought to be unattainable for many years .",
    "if one adds to the ginsparg wilson relation , as originally formulated in 1982  @xcite , a requirement of @xmath0-hermiticity , the combination is equivalent to the overlap at the algebraic level .",
    "the set - up has been of interest to mathematicians much earlier as a generalization of the concept of angle between two straight intersecting lines in a plane .",
    "the plane is generalized to a vector space over the complex numbers and the two lines to two subspaces of the vector space  @xcite . in our application",
    "the dimension of the vector space will always be even , but the subspaces can have unequal dimensions - when they do , the angle concept looses its meaning .",
    "the kato setup is also meaningful for infinite dimensional hilbert spaces and has other applications to physics  @xcite .",
    "the subspaces are defined by projectors onto them , in our case the projectors are hermitian and replaced by linearly related reflections , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 eigenspaces of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the subspaces in question .",
    "they are spanned by orthonormal sets denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the information about the relative positioning of the subspaces is contained in the overlap matrix @xmath9 : @xmath10 the coarsest measure of relative orientation is obviously @xmath11 .",
    "the main identity  @xcite is @xmath12 in our case @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is any lattice version of the dirac operator describing fermions with negative mass of order @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the lattice spacing .",
    "@xmath2 can be thought of as describing dirac fermions of positive infinite mass .",
    "@xmath16 is restricted by the requirement that @xmath19 be hermitian . the simplest choice , which minimizes operations in the computation of the action of @xmath16 on a vector , is to pick @xmath16 as the wilson lattice dirac operator .",
    "it is possible that when all practical aspects of a simulation are taken into account a seemingly more complicated choice would pay better off .",
    "@xmath19 depends on the background gauge field represented by a collection of unitary link matrices @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath19 has the following properties :    * @xmath19 is too large to be stored in the computer memory in its entirety , but it is sparse , so its action on vectors can be implemented . *",
    "the spectrum of @xmath19 is bounded by a finite bound that does not depend on the gauge background . * if all products of gauge matrices on links around plaquettes , @xmath21 , obey @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a small positive number independent of the gauge background , the spectrum of @xmath24 is also bounded by a finite number , independently of the gauge - field .",
    "the calculation of the action of @xmath1 on a vector must use sparse matrix techniques .",
    "the boundedness of the spectrum means that the sign function needs to be approximated accurately only in two finite segments symmetrical about zero , which contain the entire spectrum of @xmath19 , for any gauge background allowed by the pure gauge action",
    ". the main strain on the approximation occurs around zero , where the gap turns out in practice to be very small .",
    "this is where essentially all the numerical cost goes .",
    "there are two main approaches to the approximate implementation of the sign function : one is the direct approach ( overlap ) , and the other is indirect ( domain wall fermions )",
    ".    in the direct approach one looks for a rational approximation for the sign function in the range defined by the bounds on the spectrum of @xmath19 .",
    "the rational approximation is written as a sum of pole terms .",
    "the crucial point is that the action of each pole term on a vector need not be calculated separately : rather , the action of all terms can be calculated simultaneously , in one single pass through the conjugate gradient algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the approximation gets more accurate when the number of pole terms is increased .",
    "settling for a certain number of terms , @xmath25 , one obtains an approximation for @xmath1 , @xmath26 the `` masses '' @xmath27 have to be non - negative , but the weights @xmath28 can take either sign . in practice we need the action of @xmath29 on a vector , so the action of @xmath30 is needed many times for one evaluation .",
    "we end up with two levels of nested conjugate gradient algorithms .    in the context of domain wall fermions",
    "an approximation for the sign function is not constructed directly .",
    "rather , one invents a larger problem , defined by a matrix @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath31 is determined by @xmath19 but its dimensions are @xmath25-times larger .",
    "@xmath31 is still sparse .",
    "one then arranges that in a given subspace of the larger space @xmath31 acts on one has @xmath32 above , @xmath33 and @xmath34 can differ from eq .",
    "( 2 ) by terms that disappear in the continuum limit .",
    "the exact form is a matter of convenience .",
    "one ends up needing to do only one inversion , using a single conjugate gradient algorithm ( cg ) . in the most common applications of domain wall fermions",
    "one uses a construction of @xmath31 due to kaplan  @xcite . historically , kaplan s formulation came first , and was a prime motivator for subsequent developments .",
    "the main difference between the two methods is that one has a nested cg in one and a single cg in the other , but employing a larger matrix .",
    "the objective of my work with narayanan  @xcite was to invent a model containing a version of @xmath31 which is close to kaplan s domain wall fermions , but also to the rational approximation so that a comparison of numerical costs may be carried out using rigorous methods .",
    "we wanted the output of either method to be the same in exact arithmetic , so it would be only the ways of doing the calculation that differ .",
    "one way is similar to domain wall fermions and the other is direct .",
    "let @xmath35 be the dirac field describing a light quark .",
    "we wish to end up with an effective action for @xmath35 given by : @xmath36\\psi .\\ ] ] to be specific , we choose @xmath37 with @xmath38 this rational approximation can be easily replaced by others .",
    "we now add @xmath39 extra fields , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , pack them together with the light field into a combined field , @xmath42 . the total action is @xmath43 introduce @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the matrix @xmath31 is given by : @xmath46 our goal is attained by the model because of the identity :    @xmath47 \\times \\nonumber\\\\ \\int d\\bar\\psi d\\psi e^{-\\bar\\psi \\left ( { { 1+\\mu}\\over 2 } \\gamma_5 + { { 1-\\mu}\\over { 2n}}\\sum_{s=1}^n { 1\\over { c_s^2 h_w + { { s_s^2}\\over h_w } } } \\right ) \\psi } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the prefactor can be canceled by adding pseudofermions , which will be decoupled in the @xmath48 index .",
    "let us now roughly estimate computational costs . in the direct approach the number of inner iterations is approximately given by the condition number of @xmath19 , @xmath49 ( which is the square root of the condition number of @xmath50 ) .",
    "the number of outer iteration goes as the condition number of @xmath33 which is roughly @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the total number of @xmath52 actions is roughly given by @xmath53 .    in the domain wall version",
    "the number of @xmath54 operations is governed by @xmath55 .",
    "every @xmath54 operation counts roughly as @xmath39 @xmath19 operations .",
    "we need to estimate @xmath55 in terms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . to find @xmath55",
    "we need the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of @xmath58 .",
    "the basic trick for finding @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the derivation of an exact formula for @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 \\times \\nonumber\\\\ \\det \\left [ { { 1+\\mu}\\over 2}\\gamma_5 + z   + { { 1-\\mu}\\over 2 } f_n ( h_w , z ) \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath63 eigenvalues of @xmath31 are roots of the equation @xmath64 .",
    "all the roots come from roots of the last factor .",
    "( roots of the factors in the product over @xmath48 are canceled by poles in the last factor .",
    "so , the spectrum of @xmath31 is determined by the last factor . )",
    "we write @xmath65 where , @xmath66 the point is that one has explicit formulae for @xmath67 , so long @xmath18 and @xmath68 are real . if @xmath69 we have @xmath70 if @xmath71 , @xmath72 these formulae make the @xmath25-dependence explicit .",
    "let me describe the main idea for deriving bounds on the eigenvalues of @xmath31 .",
    "we are looking for zero modes of : @xmath73 conditions on @xmath74 , depending on @xmath57 and spectral properties of @xmath19 , limit the eigenvalues of @xmath75 to some range .",
    "suppose @xmath76 is a zero mode of @xmath77 .",
    "it can exist only if @xmath78 is in the range of eigenvalue of @xmath79 .",
    "but , @xmath80 is bounded from above and below for @xmath81 and for @xmath82 .",
    "so , it is possible to exclude vicinities of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    in this way we obtain rigorous bounds :",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 is a function of the spectrum of @xmath19 and of @xmath57 .",
    "it is well defined and calculable but clumsy to write down . for ranges of practical interest @xmath87 .",
    "this leads us to : @xmath88 where the last factor is close to unity in practice .",
    "the meaning of the result is quite obvious : we need to overcome both the lattice artifact of having at times almost zero modes for @xmath19 and the physical effect of small quark mass ( @xmath57 , when close to zero , gives the bare lattice quark mass ) .",
    "clearly our conclusion speaks in favor of the direct approach , if we assume the bounds to be typically saturated ( the action of @xmath31 is @xmath39 more expensive than that of @xmath19 ) .",
    "but , before jumping to this conclusion we should try to decide how good our bounds are .",
    "it turns out they are quite good .",
    "the bound on the @xmath59 is typically saturated . as far",
    "as @xmath89 goes we can prove @xmath90 ^ 2 \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can not do better than @xmath91 either . for @xmath57 small enough and @xmath25 large enough @xmath92",
    "thus either a very small eigenvalue of @xmath93 or a very small mass are guaranteed to make the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath58 very small too .",
    "the lower bound in eq . ( 18 ) , if optimal , indicates that it is possible for the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath58 to be as small as the product of these two small numbers .",
    "for true domain wall fermions with action @xmath94 we can prove only one kind of bound : @xmath95 ^ 2 \\nonumber\\\\ + ( 1+\\mu)^2 \\left ( { 1\\over n } -{1\\over { n^2 } } \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an approximate analysis yields @xmath96 upper bounds on @xmath97 are of order 10 in practice .",
    "we conclude that the matrices describing the version of domain wall fermions used in large scale simulations have conditions numbers that behave similarly to the condition number of our model .",
    "= 2.5 in    in a modest numerical experiment on a two - dimensional @xmath98 model we compared domain wall fermions using our alternative model , true domain wall fermions and the direct overlap approach .",
    "the pure gauge action was of the single plaquette type , with a lattice coupling @xmath99 and the lattice size was @xmath100 .",
    "we performed the calculations needed to obtain the condensate @xmath101 .",
    "we required the norm of the residual to go down to @xmath102 and counted operations of @xmath19 on a vector .",
    "the value of @xmath25 used was @xmath103 .",
    "we did not use preconditioning in any of the three methods .",
    "results were obtained using 20 gauge field configurations .",
    "figure 1 shows the number of @xmath19-on - vector operations as a function of quark mass .",
    "the comparison between the direct overlap and the alternative method is simple because , by design , the numbers one would get in exact arithmetic are the same in either method . comparing to true domain wall fermions is more difficult because one needs to match parameters to get similar physics , and this is ambiguous .",
    "for example we set the wilson mass parameter in @xmath19 to @xmath104 in all three cases and used the same mass parameter @xmath57 although this certainly is not correct for very small @xmath57 .",
    "we found that the best was to use the direct overlap approach , but this experiment was very limited and one should not immediately draw conclusions about numerical qcd .",
    "however , there is enough evidence by now to scrutinize seriously the question whether it is worth investing large scale computational resources into true domain wall fermions given that there is a direct overlap alternative . in particular",
    "we have employed no preconditioning and ignored many other options of optimization .",
    "theoretically , one is more comfortable with overlap fermions , since they differ from other four dimensional fermions just by a more complicated action . if the domain wall approach were more effective computationally one could have the best of the two worlds by using our alternative domain wall fermions .",
    "whichever the case may be , it is hard to argue in favor of true domain wall fermions .",
    "until now we concerned ourselves only with counting operations .",
    "but , as is well known , this is only one aspect of a computation .",
    "memory requirements and access patterns matter as much , or more , depending on architecture . until now all methods required a factor of @xmath25 times more memory than on ordinary wilson fermion code would .    in the direct approach",
    "there is an option to trade a factor of order 2 in operations for reducing the memory needed to that of ordinary wilson fermions .",
    "basically , this is possible because the heart of the code is a conjugate gradient procedure , and only a certain linear combination of the @xmath25 vectors that are acted on is needed .",
    "the conjugate gradient procedure is closely related to the lanczos scheme for bringing a hermitian matrix to tri - diagonal form .",
    "it is well known that in the lanczos scheme , if one wishes additional information ( for example one needs an eigenvector ) one can avoid large memory consumption by going through the algorithm twice , once to collect the coefficients and a second time to accumulate the needed data .",
    "the same works here  @xcite .    in the multishift scheme  @xcite",
    "one iterates over an index @xmath105 updating @xmath25 vectors @xmath106 , starting from an input vector @xmath68 . at each iteration",
    "these vectors are determined by a few @xmath48-dependent scalars and by three @xmath48-independent vectors that make up the core conjugate algorithm , @xmath107 . among them , @xmath108 is the residual .",
    "when the iteration is stopped we have @xmath25 @xmath109 vectors and they are summed into @xmath110 , our approximation to the vector @xmath111 @xmath112 actually , the iteration must be effectively stopped after a different number of steps for each @xmath48 , since for higher values of @xmath48 the `` mass '' is larger and , as a result , the convergence much faster .",
    "clearly , @xmath110 is made out of the basic krylov vectors generated in the core conjugate gradient ; the single reason we need to store @xmath25 vectors is that the components of @xmath110 in the krylov basis at step @xmath105 in the iteration are not yet known because they depend also on steps @xmath113 .",
    "the idea is now to use a first pass to calculate the needed conjugate gradient scalars which are @xmath105 dependent but not @xmath48-dependent . using these scalars we can now compute in an iteration storing scalars only the extra @xmath48 and @xmath105-dependent scalars needed for implementing the multishift .",
    "it is possible now to also compute a set of @xmath48-independent scalars @xmath114 which have the property that @xmath115 becomes at the last iteration the desired approximation for @xmath110 .",
    "but , we need the vectors @xmath116 again so we need to run the basic conjugate gradient again . hence , a second pass is required , but one needs to store only four large vectors for any @xmath25 .",
    "a more detailed description of the algorithm can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the surprise was that with a code written in a higher level language the two pass version can actually run faster than the single pass version , by about 30 percent .",
    "in the two pass version both the operations count and the memory usage are independent on @xmath25 !",
    "the speed up is certainly a surprise and must be strongly machine dependent .",
    "but , it turns out , that one gets the same amount of speed - up on an sgi o2000  @xcite as on a pentium iii pc  @xcite .",
    "let us summarize roughly the situation we were looking at when we began to work on reference  @xcite : although an approach based on the overlap dirac operator looked theoretically cleaner , true domain wall fermions were more attractive numerically .",
    "our analysis has led us to the conclusion that there is no evidence that true domain wall fermions have even a numerical advantage .    in all cases we looked at ,",
    "one faces a problem related to almost zero modes of @xmath19 .",
    "this requires large numbers of extra fields in order to preserve chirality .",
    "it also affects adversely the condition numbers .",
    "whichever method we use , the worst case condition numbers are a product of the inverses of two main scale ratios : the first is the scale of the small eigenvalues of @xmath50 divided by an upper bound of the order of 5 - 10 in lattice units . the second scale ratio is the lattice physical quark mass squared divided by a number of order unity .",
    "each small scale ratio slows down inversion independently and the effect compounds in the worst case .",
    "thus , as far as we can see , at the numerical level , there are no _ a priori _ advantages to choosing true domain wall fermions over overlap fermions in the context of qcd . in both formulations",
    "one faces similar numerical obstacles , and the overlap , to say the least , does not fare any worse than domain wall fermions . at the analytical level",
    "we are convinced that an approach based on the overlap ( or any other efficient replacement of the overlap dirac operator that might be found in the future ) is superior at presently attainable gauge couplings in numerical qcd .",
    "perturbation theory is more transparent to interpret and technically less complex in the overlap version .",
    "the chirality violating effects associated with the number of extra fields are much more explicit and therefore their impact should be easier to trace through .",
    "algorithmically we have been looking only under the lamp post and we are far from having exhausted the options there .",
    "nevertheless , i feel that true domain wall fermions are an inefficient way to incorporate the new ideas about lattice chirality into practical qcd simulations .",
    "for other recent work on similar issues the reader is referred to  @xcite .",
    "i would like to urge you to use your imagination : there must exists much better ways than the ones we have tried until now .",
    "this research was supported in part by doe grant de - fg02 - 96er40949 and by a guggenheim fellowship .",
