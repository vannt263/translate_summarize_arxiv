    "hadronic transitions between states of the available heavy quarkonia , charmonium and bottomonium , present a very interesting case study in dynamics of both the heavy quarks and the light mesons emitted in the transitions . in particular , the observed properties of such processes with the emission of two pions are understood within the chiral low - energy dynamics of pions , starting with the earliest observation  @xcite of the decay @xmath3 and the theoretical analyses of the data  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the qcd picture of such decays is that the heavy quarkonium transition generates soft gluonic field which then produces the light mesons .",
    "the heavy quarkonium can be considered as a compact and nonrelativistic object in its interaction with a soft gluonic field , which justifies the use of the multipole expansion in qcd in analysing these processes  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the amplitude of the process factorizes into the heavy quarkonium part , i.e. the transition between the levels as a source of the field , and the light meson part , which describes the creation of the mesons by the field operators .",
    "the former part depends on the dynamics of the quarkonium , while the latter one can be understood in some detail by combining  @xcite the methods of chiral dynamics and the general low - energy relations in qcd , in particular those for the anomalies in the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and in the singlet axial current .",
    "each of these two factors in the amplitudes of the discussed hadronic transitions can be used , in certain extent , independently .",
    "for instance , the decays @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( as well as @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) have essentially the same heavy quarkonium part , so that the ratio of the decay rates is fully determined by the low - energy meson amplitudes  @xcite . on the other hand the charmonium amplitude for the double interaction with the chromo - electric field ( the chromo - polarizability ) , which dominates the quarkonium factor in the decay @xmath3 can be used  @xcite for considering the low - energy limit of the conversion of @xmath8 into @xmath9 on a nucleon : @xmath10 , where the soft gluonic field is that inside the nucleon .",
    "the same charmonium transition amplitude can be used as a benchmark for the diagonal chromo - polarizability of @xmath9 , which determines the low - energy elastic scattering of @xmath9 on a nucleon  @xcite . for these reasons a more detailed understanding of both the heavy quarkonium amplitudes and of those determining the gluon conversion into light mesons is desirable .",
    "presently a quite detailed experimental data are available on the dominant hadronic transitions in charmonium  @xcite : @xmath3 , and in bottomonium  @xcite : @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "numerous other , less visible , transitions have been observed , e.g. @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "thus it is not unreasonable to expect , given the capabilities of the modern @xmath13 experiments at the charm and bottom thresholds , that a significantly improved data will become available .",
    "such data may enable a study of finer effects in the amplitudes of the hadronic transitions beyond the leading ones thus far considered in the literature .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to analyze sub - leading relativistic effects in the amplitudes of the two - pion transitions in charmonium and bottomonium , and possible ways of studying such effects from the data . for the transitions between the @xmath14 states of quarkonium , dominated by the second order in the leading @xmath15 term of the multipole expansion , these corrections arise from the second order in the @xmath16 interaction .",
    "it will be argued that in the charmonium transition @xmath3 the correction adds coherently to the leading term as an @xmath17 term .",
    "being of a rather moderate value in this particular decay , the correction is enhanced by a factor of 3 in the transition @xmath18 with a potentially very noticeable effect in the spectrum of the dipion invariant mass .",
    "furthermore , this correction modifies the estimate of the charmonium chromo - polarizability with implications for charmonium scattering on nucleons .",
    "it will be further argued that , although generally the relativistic effects in bottomonium are quite small , in the particular case of the decay @xmath19 it appears that the leading nonrelativistic term it strongly suppressed dynamically , and including the relativistic effects of the @xmath16 interaction and of the @xmath20 mixing can possibly resolve the long standing puzzle of the peculiar observed spectrum of the dipion invariant masses in this decay , which spectrum by far does not conform with the predictions from the leading chromo - electric interaction .",
    "also some consideration will be given to the significance of the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the pions in the two - pion transitions .",
    "the fsi effects have been discussed ever since the earliest analyses  @xcite , and are generally believed to be moderate in the kinematical region of the decays @xmath21 and @xmath6 .",
    "however once the amplitudes of the transitions are studied in finer detail , one will have to better quantify these effects .",
    "although at present the fsi effects can not be fully analyzed , their behavior at low invariant mass of the two pions can be estimated within the chiral expansion . for this purpose",
    "we give here a systematic derivation of the amplitudes for two pion production by gluonic operators in the leading chiral limit , including the terms with the pion mass , and consider the first sub - leading term due to iteration of the chiral amplitudes . at the invariant mass of the two pions near the threshold these corrections are quite small - only few percent .",
    "their continuation to higher values of the invariant mass can be studied experimentally in a rather straightforward way .",
    "such study , in particular , would quantify the impact of the fsi effects on the estimates of the quarkonium amplitudes from the observed decay rates .",
    "it will be also argued that even with the already available data such impact can be estimated as quite moderate , as generally expected .     the material in the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic dipole interactions responsible for the two - pion transitions are discussed and the parameters determining the relevant quarkonium amplitudes to order @xmath22 are introduced .",
    "the section 3 contains a compilative derivation in the leading chiral order of the amplitudes for creation of the pion pair by gluonic operators , and in section 4 the discussion of the two previous sections is combined in the expressions for the two - pion transition amplitudes with the leading relativistic terms included .",
    "the latter expressions are confronted with the available date on the transitions @xmath23 and @xmath24 in section 5 and the significance of the chromo - magnetic interaction in transitions between charmonium resonances is evaluated . in section 6 the fsi effects",
    "are considered using iteration of the chiral amplitudes and it is also argued on phenomenological grounds that these effects are only of a moderate magnitude in the observed two - pion transitions .",
    "the section 7 addresses the long - standing puzzle of the unusual spectrum of the dipion invariant masses observed in the decay @xmath25 and it is suggested that this spectrum can be explained if the formally leading nonrelativistic quarkonium amplitude is dynamically suppressed in this transition , so that the relativistic terms provide a significant contribution . finally , section 8 contains a summary of the discussion in the present paper .",
    "considering quarkonium as a compact nonrelativistic object one can apply the multipole expansion for the quarkonium interaction with soft gluonic field  @xcite .",
    "the leading term in this expansion is the chromo - electric dipole interaction with the chromo - electric field @xmath26 described by the hamiltonian h_e1=-1 2 ^a r ^a ( 0 )  , [ e1 ] where @xmath27 is the difference of the color generators acting on the quark and antiquark ( e.g. @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the gell - mann matrices ) , and @xmath30 is the vector for relative position of the quark and the antiquark .",
    "the convention used throughout this paper is that the qcd coupling @xmath31 is included in normalization of the gluon field operators , so that e.g. the gluon field lagrangian is written as @xmath32 .",
    "the amplitude of the two - pion transition between heavy quarkonium states @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 and @xmath35 used as a generic notation for the initial and the final quarkonium states ) can thus be written as   are considered here , since the emission of neutral pions @xmath36 is trivially related by the isospin symmetry . ]",

    "in other words , the @xmath38 transition in the chromo - electric field is described by the effective hamiltonian h_eff=-1 2 ^(12)_i j e^a_i e^a_j  , [ heff ] with the chromo - polarizability given by ^(12)_i j=1 16 _ 1 | ^a r_i g r_j ^a | _ 2  , [ aij ] where @xmath39 is the green s function of the heavy quark pair in a color octet state .",
    "the latter function is not well understood presently , so that an _ ab initio _ calculation of the chromo - polarizability would be at least highly model dependent .",
    "also a simple remark is in order that the discussed decays in quarkonia are governed by transitional polarizabilities , i.e. those linking different states of quarkonium .",
    "the diagonal chromo - polarizability of quarkonium states , in particular of the charmonium resonances @xmath8 and @xmath9 can also be measured  @xcite and is relevant to the problem of scattering of these resonances on nuclei  @xcite .",
    "generally @xmath40 is a symmetric tensor .",
    "clearly , for transitions between pure @xmath41 wave quarkonium states this tensor is necessarily proportional to @xmath42 : @xmath43 .",
    "however for the @xmath14 states a @xmath20 mixing generally takes place due to the relativistic effects in the order @xmath22 so that a traceless @xmath44 wave part of the chromo - polarizability is also present and is proportional to spin-2 combination of the polarizations , @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the initial and the final states : _",
    "i j = _ 0 _ ij ( _ 1 _ 2 ) + _ 2  .",
    "[ asd ] numerically , the @xmath20 mixing in charmonium appears to be comparable with the characteristic value of the relativistic parameter for this system , @xmath47 . in particular , rosner  @xcite using the @xmath13 decay width of @xmath48 and considering this resonance as dominantly a @xmath49 state , estimates the angle @xmath50 of the @xmath51 mixing , i.e. the @xmath20 mixing for @xmath8 , as @xmath52 .",
    "it can be noticed however that the mixing does not contribute to the spinless part @xmath53 of the chromo - polarizability and that in the spin - averaged transition rate there is no interference between the @xmath41 and @xmath44 wave parts of @xmath54 .",
    "thus the effect of the @xmath20 mixing in the rate is of order @xmath55 and is thus generally very small .",
    "it should be also mentioned that the effects of the recoil of the final quarkonium state in the decay also arise in the order @xmath22 and contribute terms quadratic in the momentum of the pion pair @xmath56 to the spin - diagonal part of the tensor polarizability @xmath54 .",
    "however such terms would also be of higher order in the chiral expansion in the pion momenta , which is used here .",
    "therefore the recoil terms are suppressed by a product of two small parameters and can be neglected within the approximations adopted in this paper .     besides the discussed @xmath20 mixing , the only other effect in the order @xmath22 in the amplitudes of two - pion transitions between quarkonium @xmath41 wave states arises through the second order in the m1 interaction with the chromo - magnetic field @xmath57 described by the hamiltonian h_m1= - 1 2 m ^a ( ^a )  , [ m1 ] where @xmath58 is the difference of the spin operators acting on the quark and the antiquark , and @xmath59 is the heavy quark mass .",

    "it is taken into account here that the amplitudes generated by the m1 interaction are already suppressed in comparison with those described by eq.([e1ampg ] ) by the factor @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the wave functions of the quarkonium states can be taken in the form where the spin and coordinate parts are factorized .",
    "the spin-2 part of the amplitude in eq.([am1 ] ) contributes to the decay rate only in the order @xmath55 , similarly to the effect of the @xmath67 mixing .",
    "however , the spin-0 part in this amplitude as well as that in eq.([am0 ] ) ( the only one present there ) does interfere with the leading nonrelativistic amplitude in eq.([e1ampg ] ) proportional to @xmath53 from eq.([asd ] ) .",
    "therefore this part provides the first relativistic correction , proportional to @xmath22 , to the transition rate .",
    "one can also notice that the effect for the @xmath61 states is three times bigger than for the @xmath14 states .",
    "as one can see from the previous section , a crucial role in the discussed approach to calculating the two - pion transition amplitudes is played by the amplitudes for production of two pions by operators quadratic in components of the gluon field strength tensor . therefore in this section we consider the general amplitude of such type : @xmath68 , describing the creation of two pions by the local gluonic operator @xmath69 . in the leading chiral limit the momenta @xmath70 and @xmath71 of the pions as well as the pion mass @xmath72 are to be considered as small parameters , and the expression for the amplitude , quadratic in these parameters , can be written in the following general form - ^+(p_1 ) ^-(p_2)| f_^a f_^a|0 = ( g _ g _ - g _ g_)+ z t _  , [ genf ] where the structure @xmath73 has zero overall trace : @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are yet undetermined coefficients .",
    "the form of the amplitude in eq.([genf ] ) is uniquely determined by the symmetry ( with respect to the indices ) of the operator @xmath78 and by the adler zero condition , which requires that the amplitude goes to zero when either one of the two pion momenta is set to zero and the other one is on the mass shell . ] .    the coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 in eq.([genf ] ) are in fact determined  @xcite by the anomaly in the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath79 in qcd .",
    "indeed , in the low - energy limit in qcd , i.e. in qcd with three light quarks , one finds _ ^=-b 32 ^2 f^a",
    "_ f^a + _ q = u , d , s m_q ( |q q )  , [ anom ] where @xmath80 is the first coefficient in the beta function for qcd with three quark flavors .",
    "the first term in eq.([anom ] ) represents the conformal anomaly , while the quark mass term arises due to the explicit breaking of the scale invariance by quark masses . on the other hand , the matrix element of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath79 over the pions : @xmath81 is fully determined  @xcite in the quadratic in @xmath82 and @xmath72 order by the conditions of symmetry in @xmath83 and @xmath84 , conservation on the mass shell ( @xmath85 at @xmath86 ) , normalization ( @xmath87 at @xmath88 ) , and the adler zero condition ( @xmath89 ) : _ ( p_1,p_2)= g _ -p_1 p_2- p_1 p_2  . [ st ]",
    "the equations ( [ genf ] ) and ( [ st ] ) allow for the pion momenta to be off - shell in order to demonstrate the adler zero .",
    "however in what follows only the amplitudes with pions on the mass shell will be considered , so that it will be henceforth implied that @xmath86 .",

    "[ tst ] furthermore , the quark mass term in eq.([anom ] ) , corresponding to the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry in qcd corresponds to the same symmetry breaking by the pion mass term in the pion theory .",

    "few remarks are due regarding effects of higher order in @xmath99 .",
    "the trace term in eq.([kapf ] ) receives no renormalization , provided that the coefficient @xmath100 is replaced by @xmath101 with @xmath102 being the full beta function in qcd .",
    "this modification however only affects the overall normalization of the trace part , and can in fact be absorbed into the definition of the heavy quarkonium amplitudes .",
    "on the contrary , the relative coefficient of the traceless term in eq.([kapf ] ) , i.e. the parameter @xmath97 , does depend on the normalization scale , which scale is appropriate to be chosen as the characteristic size of the heavy quarkonium  @xcite .",

    "the two waves can be measured separately , and also any effects of the final state interaction between pions are different in these two orbital states .",
    "therefore it is quite instructive for the subsequent discussion to explicitly separate the @xmath41 and @xmath44 waves in the matrix element , i.e. to rewrite the amplitude ( [ kapf ] ) in the form - ^+(p_1 ) ^-(p_2)| f_^a f_^a|0 = s_+ d _  .",

    "in either case the difference between the specific numerical estimates is within the experimental and theoretical uncertainty , while the estimated value compares well with the expected magnitude of the relativistic effects in charmonium .",
    "a more definite determination of the parameter @xmath150 could be enabled by observing the distribution in the dipion mass in the decay @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , as previously mentioned , the effect of the chromo - magnetic m1 interaction is enhanced in this decay by a factor of 3 .",
    "if the value of @xmath122 for the charmonium transitions is in the estimated range @xmath151 , the effective parameter @xmath152 for the latter decay can amount to 0.3 - 0.45 . although the prospect of measuring the @xmath126 wave in the decay is likely very remote , the effect of such larger value of @xmath139 should be visible in the more experimentally accessible spectrum of the dipion mass , as illustrated in fig.1 . as can be seen from the plots the larger value of @xmath152 results in a significant suppression of the spectrum at low invariant mass , due to the zero of the @xmath41 wave amplitude at a higher , than for @xmath3 , value of @xmath153 .",
    "also the total rate contains an overall suppression due to the factor @xmath154 vs. the factor @xmath155 for the transition between the @xmath14 states .",
    "so far the amplitudes of the two - pion transitions were considered here in the chiral limit . the formulas in eq.([kapf ] ) and in eqs.([sw ] ) and ( [ dw ] ) are exact in the leading chiral order , i.e. as far as the quadratic terms in the pion momenta and mass are concerned .",
    "the only dynamical modification of these expressions can arise from the previously mentioned qcd renormalization effects .",
    "in particular these expressions get no corrections due to the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the pions .",
    "the latter interaction however can give rise to the terms whose expansion starts with the fourth power of momenta and the pion mass , and generally can modify the amplitude at momenta of the pions relevant for actual transitions in quarkonium .",
    "the effects of fsi in chiral treatment of the two - pion transitions in quarkonium were a matter of concern ever since the earlier theoretical analyses  @xcite .",
    "the effect in the phases of the amplitudes is well known : these phases for the production amplitudes are equal to the two - pion scattering phases in the corresponding partial waves : @xmath156 , @xmath157 , where the @xmath158 phases for the @xmath41 wave , @xmath159 , and for the @xmath44 wave , @xmath160 are quite well studied .",
    "decay does not take into account the relative phase between the @xmath41 and @xmath44 wave pion production amplitudes",
    ". thus it would be interesting to know whether including the phase factor in the angular analysis , produces a significant impact on the results .",
    "] it is also generally estimated both on theoretical and phenomenological grounds that the fsi corrections are not big ( at most 20 - 25% ) in the transitions @xmath161 and @xmath24 .",
    "( for a discussion see the review  @xcite . ) some phenomenological arguments in favor of such estimate will also be discussed further towards the end of this section , and we start with a theoretical estimate of the onset of the higher term in the chiral expansion .",
    "the interaction of pions at low energy in the @xmath44 wave is quite weak , so that any modification by fsi of the @xmath44 wave production amplitude of eq.([dw ] ) can be safely neglected , and only the modification of the @xmath41 wave amplitude ( [ sw ] ) , @xmath162 , is of interest for present phenomenology .",
    "the imaginary part of the correction at @xmath163 is found from the unitarity relation in terms of the isospin i=0 @xmath164 scattering amplitude @xmath165 in the @xmath41 wave as ( s _ ) = t(q^2 ) 16 s _  .",
    "[ unit ] the amplitude @xmath165 is well known in the chiral limit , i.e. in the quadratic in @xmath110 and @xmath72 approximation , since the work of weinberg  @xcite . in the normalization used here this amplitude has the form t(q^2)=2 q^2 - m^2 f_^2  , [ tpipi ] where @xmath166mev is the @xmath167 decay constant .",
    "clearly , the expression in eq.([unit ] ) is of the fourth power in @xmath110 and @xmath72 .",
    "the real part of @xmath162 can then be estimated from eq.([unit ] ) using the dispersion relation in @xmath153 for the amplitude @xmath41 . in doing",
    "so one should set the condition for the subtraction constants that this real part does not contain quadratic ( and certainly also constant ) terms in @xmath110 and @xmath72 , since these are given by eq.([sw ] ) .",
    "after these subtractions the remaining dispersion integral is still logarithmically divergent and contains the well known ` chiral logarithm ' , depending on the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath168 , which is usually set at @xmath169gev , i.e. the scale where any chiral expansion certainly breaks down .",
    "using the equations ( [ sw ] ) , ( [ unit ] ) and ( [ tpipi ] ) one can readily estimate the first fsi correction with a ` logarithmic accuracy ' .",
    "the expression for the full @xmath41 wave production amplitude then takes the form @xmath170 \\right \\}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the correction terms @xmath171 and @xmath160 to eq.([sw ] ) are given as _ 1 = 2 ( q^2)^2- 7 q^2 m^2 + 3 m^4 16 ^2 f_^2 ( q^2+m^2 ) + i 2 q^2 - m^2 16 f_^2  , [ xi1 ] and _ 2 = 2 ( q^2)^2- 9 q^2 m^2 + 8 m^4 16 ^2 f_^2 ( q^2 + 2 m^2 ) + i 2 q^2 - m^2 16 f_^2  , [ xi2 ] where",
    "the non - logarithmic imaginary part is retained for reference regarding the normalization .",
    "the lower limit under the logarithm is generally a function of both @xmath153 and @xmath90 , however any difference of this function from the value @xmath90 used in eqs.([xi1 ] ) and ( [ xi2 ] ) is a non - logarithmic term , i.e. beyond the accuracy of these equations .",
    "since @xmath90 is the smallest of the two parameters in the physical region of pion production , it can be expected that using this parameter provides a conservative estimate of the effect of fsi .    estimating the corrections in eq.([xi1 ] ) and eq.([xi2 ] )",
    ", one finds that at the lower end of the physical phase space , i.e. near @xmath172 , these terms do not exceed few percent .",
    "thus the corrections only weakly modify the normalization of the pion production amplitude near the threshold .",
    "a theoretical extrapolation to higher values of @xmath153 is problematic , and , most likely , one would have to resort to using actual data on the dipion spectra in order to judge upon the significance of deviation from the essentially linear in @xmath153 behavior of the amplitude described by eq.([spp ] ) . a quantitative estimate of the deviation from this behavior has been attempted  @xcite using the data  @xcite on @xmath173 by parametrizing the deviation as a factor @xmath174 in the amplitude with @xmath59 being a parameter .",
    "the thus obtained lower limit on @xmath59 is @xmath175gev at 90% c.l .",
    "another phenomenological argument in favor of a relatively moderate fsi effect in the absolute value of the dominant @xmath41 wave in the decay @xmath4 stems from the previously mentioned agreement of the observed  @xcite value of the ratio @xmath176 with the parameter @xmath97 entering the expression for the @xmath41 wave and extracted from the two - pion invariant mass spectrum .",
    "clearly such an agreement would be ruined if there was a significant enhancement of the @xmath41 wave by fsi .    furthermore , the observed ratio of the rates of the transitions @xmath177 and @xmath3 reasonably agrees with the calculation  @xcite , which neglects any fsi effects in the latter decay , while it is clear that there is no such effects in the emission of one - particle , i.e. of @xmath178 .",
    "the expected accuracy of the theoretical calculation is mostly that of applying the nonrelativistic limit to charmonium , i.e. @xmath179 in the amplitude .",
    "thus the theoretical ( and experimental ) uncertainty may allow for a presence of the fsi effects in the two - pion system at such level , however large effects of this type , like those recently claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , are definitely excluded .",
    "finally , one can notice in connection with the equations ( [ d2 ] ) and ( [ d3 ] ) for the @xmath127 and @xmath128 waves involving the polarizations of the quarkonium resonances , that the unknown quarkonium matrix elements all cancel in the ratio @xmath180 .",
    "the @xmath127 amplitude is determined by the @xmath41 wave of the pions in their c.m .",
    "system , and the @xmath128 contains the pions in the @xmath44 wave relative to each other . thus if the ratio of actual amplitudes @xmath180 could be measured from angular distributions , e.g. in the decay @xmath4 , this would produce direct data on the modification by fsi of the @xmath41 wave relative to the @xmath44 wave .",
    "the decay @xmath25 is known to be quite different from the  well behaved \" transitions @xmath3 and @xmath6 in that the spectrum  @xcite of the dipion invariant masses in this decay has two distinct maxima at low and high values of @xmath153 .",
    "the proposed solutions to the puzzle presented by this behavior included presence of a hypothetical exotic resonance  @xcite , breakdown of the multipole expansion  @xcite , and unusual fsi effects  @xcite . in this section",
    "i exercise an alternative , and somewhat more conventional explanation of the observed behavior of the spectrum in terms of the considered here terms of the multipole expansion .",
    "namely , one can readily verify that the dipion mass spectrum in the decay @xmath25 is reasonably reproduced by the equations ( [ spp ] ) - ( [ d3 ] ) if the parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 for this decay are rather large : of order one , which is probably a result of a dynamical suppression of the leading nonrelativistic quarkonium amplitude @xmath53 .",
    "the overall amplitude of the decay @xmath25 is arguably strongly suppressed . indeed ,",
    "the observed absolute rate of the transition @xmath181 is only about 0.2 of the rate of @xmath6 in spite of a significantly larger available phase space",
    ". the estimated suppression of the former decay would be even stronger , if its amplitude was `` well behaved '' , i.e. given by leading e1 interaction and thus dominantly proportional to @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , the total rate of another similar transition from the same @xmath182 resonance , @xmath183 , is about 0.6 of the rate of @xmath184 , even though the energy released in the former transition is only slightly above the two - pion threshold , and the transition is very strongly kinematically suppressed .",
    "thus it appears quite reasonable to conclude that the pure @xmath41 wave part of the quarkonium amplitude in eq.([aij ] ) , @xmath53 is small for the discussed transition .",
    "this can be a result of cancellation in the ( appropriately weighed ) overlap of the wave functions determining this amplitude due to the oscillations of the @xmath185 wave function .",
    "such cancellation however is not necessarily present in the overlap terms due to the @xmath67 mixing , @xmath186 in eq.([asd ] ) , and due to the m1 interaction , @xmath187 in eq.([amg ] ) .",
    "the latter terms are naturally expected to be of the order @xmath124 in comparison with an unsuppressed leading amplitude , e.g. the amplitudes of the  well behaved \" transitions : @xmath24 or @xmath188 . in other words ,",
    "the ratia @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( eq.([chis ] ) ) can be large due to the small denominator @xmath53 . a fully quantitative analysis of the decay @xmath25 is complicated by that the energy released in the transition @xmath189mev is rather large for a straightforward application of the chiral - limit formulas for the pions .",
    "however , for at least a qualitative estimate , i neglect here this complication and apply the equations ( [ spp ] ) - ( [ d3 ] ) to evaluate the dipion mass spectrum .",
    "the resulting behavior is illustrated in fig.2 , where the parameters are set as @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 .",
    "clearly , the evaluated dipion mass spectrum closely resembles the experimentally observed  @xcite , although no attempt is made here at a quantitative fit to experimental data .    in order to assess whether the values of the relativistic parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 used in the plots of fig.2 are of the order of the expected relativistic effects in bottomonium",
    ", it is instructive to compare the corresponding amplitudes @xmath193 and @xmath194 with the amplitude of the transition , that appears to be ` normal ' , namely @xmath188 . in the latter transition",
    "the released energy is only 332mev , and according to the discussed approach it should be absolutely dominated by the @xmath41 wave amplitude given by eq.([spp ] ) .",
    "also any fsi effects in this decay should be very small due to the proximity of the pions to the threshold .",
    "to certain extent this approach can be tested by comparing the rates of the transitions with the charged pions and with the neutral , by using respectively the mass of the charged and neutral pion in considering each of these decay modes .",
    "the effect of the pion mass difference is quite essential due to the small available energy , so that after numerical integration of the rate calculated from eq.([spp ] ) one finds , in place of the isotopic ratio 2 , the estimate 1.26  , [ yppprat ] which is in the agreement with the data  @xcite : @xmath195 = ( 2.8 \\pm 0.6)\\%$ ] and @xmath196 = ( 2.00 \\pm 0.32)\\%$ ] .   used is 0.146 . due to the small energy in the process ,",
    "the estimate is quite insensitive to this particular value as long as @xmath139 is small . ]",
    "the integral over the spectrum of either of the modes of transition @xmath197 can then be compared with the result of the numerical integration over the spectrum of the decay @xmath19 produced by the amplitudes in the equations ( [ spp ] ) - ( [ d3 ] ) which gives the ratio of the rates of the two transitions from @xmath182 in terms of the ratio of the squares of the corresponding amplitudes @xmath53 and can be compared with the data . performing this calculation with the values of the parameters @xmath198 and @xmath199 used in the plots of fig.2 ,",
    "gives the estimate 0.06  ,   _",
    "m^ (  ) _ 0^ (   ) 0.04  , [ aest ] which certainly falls in the range of naturally expected magnitude of the relativistic terms in bottomonium : @xmath200 , and also quantifies the dynamical suppression of the leading nonrelativistic amplitude @xmath53 in the transition @xmath184 .",
    "however , given the large energy release in this transition it is rather difficult to quantify at present the fsi effect on the estimate ( [ aest ] ) . in either event ,",
    "the suggested explanation of the observed peculiarity of the decay @xmath25 , heavily relies on the relative prominence of the spin - dependent @xmath44 waves , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , in this decay , as can be seen from the plots of fig.2 .",
    "the relative contribution of these two waves is the largest near the minimum in the invariant mass distribution at @xmath201gev , which is the main experimentally testable qualitative prediction of the suggested mechanism .",
    "it should be mentioned in connection with the suggested presence of the spin - dependent @xmath44 waves that an experimental search for quarkonium polarization effects in @xmath25 has been done  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the data were consistent at 65% confidence level  with the expectation that the daughter @xmath202 retains the polarization of the parent @xmath182 along the beam axis \" .",
    "it thus appears that the test has not been sensitive enough and a more detailed study of the bottomonium polarization effects in this transition is needed .",
    "in summary . within the standard approach to two - pion transitions in heavy quarkonium , based on the multipole expansion in qcd and chiral dynamics of the pions , the first relativistic terms of order @xmath22 in the transition amplitudes arise from the effects of the @xmath203 mixing in the part determined by the e1 interaction and from the chromo - magnetic m1 interaction .",
    "these terms are parametrized by the quantities @xmath186 ( eq.([asd ] ) ) and @xmath187 ( eq.([amg ] ) ) .",
    "the significance of the chromo - magnetic term in two - pions transitions in charmonium can be approximately estimated from the available data on the dipion invariant mass spectrum in the decays @xmath161 and @xmath24 .",
    "the estimated value is 0.15 - 0.2 of the dominant nonrelativistic amplitude .",
    "the effect of the chromo - magnetic term is enhanced in the yet unobserved transition @xmath204 and is expected to significantly distort the spectrum in the latter decay and also result in a suppression of its rate , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the absolute determination of the leading nonrelativistic amplitude in charmonium , the chromo - polarizability , is of interest for other applications , e.g. the charmonium scattering on nuclei .",
    "such determination generally suffers from fsi effects of the two pion rescattering .",
    "these effects are estimated as a next term in the chiral expansion and amount to only few percent at a low invariant mass of the two - pion system near the threshold .",
    "an extrapolation to higher values of @xmath153 can be done using experimental data . with the presently available data",
    "there is no indication of a large fsi effect .",
    "furthermore , an agreement of the chiral - limit formulas with the data  @xcite on the @xmath44 wave in the decay @xmath205 , as well as the agreement with the data of the theoretical prediction  @xcite for the ratio of the rates of the decays @xmath5 and @xmath206 , suggest that the fsi effects may amount to at most a moderate fraction of the amplitude of the transition in charmonium .",
    "an experimental measurement of the ratio of the @xmath127 wave ( eq.([d2 ] ) ) and the @xmath128 wave ( eq.([d3 ] ) ) in @xmath206 would provide a direct test of the fsi effect .",
    "the relativistic terms in the two - pion transitions may hold the clue to solving the puzzle of the unusual dipion mass spectrum observed in the transition @xmath25 , if the leading nonrelativistic quarkonium matrix element in this transition is strongly suppressed due to details of bottomonium wave functions .",
    "although a detailed quantitative description of the latter decay is not yet attainable within the present knowledge , the suggested mechanism necessarily predicts a noticeable presence of the polarization - dependent @xmath127 and @xmath128 waves in the amplitude , which prediction can be tested experimentally .",
