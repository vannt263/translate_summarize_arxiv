    "the _ phase retrieval problem _ of fourier analysis involves determining a function @xmath9 on @xmath2 from the modulus @xmath10 of its fourier transform @xmath11 .",
    "this problem arises naturally and frequently in various areas of science , such as x - ray crystallography , electron microscopy , optics , astronomy , and remote sensing , in which only the magnitude of the fourier transform can be measured and the phase is lost .",
    "( sometimes , as when reconstructing an object from its far - field diffraction pattern , it is the squared modulus @xmath12 that is directly measured . ) in 1984 , rosenblatt @xcite wrote that the phase retrieval problem  arises in all experimental uses of diffracted electromagnetic radiation for determining the intrinsic detailed structure of a diffracting object . \" today , the word  all \" is perhaps too strong in view of recent advances in coherent diffraction imaging . in any case , the literature is vast ; see the surveys @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , as well as the articles @xcite and @xcite and the references given there .",
    "phase retrieval is fundamentally under - determined without additional constraints , which usually take the form of an a priori assumption that @xmath9 has a particular support or distribution of values .",
    "an important example is when @xmath13 , the characteristic function of a convex body @xmath1 in @xmath2 . in this",
    "setting , phase retrieval is very closely related to a geometric problem involving the _ covariogram _ of a convex body @xmath1 in @xmath2 .",
    "this is the function @xmath14 defined by @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes @xmath18-dimensional lebesgue measure and @xmath19 is the translate of @xmath1 by the vector @xmath20 .",
    "it is also sometimes called the _ set covariance _ and is equal to the _ autocorrelation _ of @xmath0 , that is , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes convolution and @xmath6 is the reflection of @xmath1 in the origin . taking fourier transforms",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath23 this connects the phase retrieval problem , restricted to characteristic functions of convex bodies , to the problem of determining a convex body from its covariogram .",
    "both the definition of covariogram and this connection extend to arbitrary measurable sets , but the reason for restricting to convex bodies will become clear .    the covariogram was introduced by matheron in his book @xcite on random sets .",
    "he showed that for a fixed @xmath24 , the directional derivatives @xmath25 , for all @xmath26 , of the covariogram of a convex body @xmath1 in @xmath2 yield the distribution of the lengths of all chords of @xmath1 parallel to @xmath27 .",
    "this explains the utility of the covariogram in fields such as stereology , geometric tomography , pattern recognition , image analysis , and mathematical morphology , where information about an unknown object is to be retrieved from chord length measurements ; see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the covariogram has also played an increasingly important role in analytic convex geometry .",
    "for example , it was used by rogers and shephard in proving their famous difference body inequality ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem  7.3.1 ) ) , by gardner and zhang @xcite in the theory of radial mean bodies , and by tsolomitis @xcite in his study of convolution bodies , which via the work of schmuckenschlger @xcite and werner @xcite allows a covariogram - based definition of the fundamental notion of affine surface area .    here",
    "we effectively solve the following three problems . in each",
    ", @xmath1 is a convex body in @xmath2 .",
    "* problem 1 ( reconstruction from covariograms)*. construct an approximation to @xmath1 from a finite number of noisy ( i.e. , taken with error ) measurements of @xmath14 .",
    "* problem 2 ( phase retrieval for characteristic functions of convex bodies : squared modulus)*. construct an approximation to @xmath1 ( or , equivalently , to @xmath0 ) from a finite number of noisy measurements of @xmath28 .",
    "* problem 3 ( phase retrieval for characteristic functions of convex bodies : modulus)*. construct an approximation to @xmath1 from a finite number of noisy measurements of @xmath29 .    in order to discuss our results",
    ", we must first address the corresponding uniqueness problems . in view of ( [ prc ] ) , these are equivalent , so we shall focus on the covariogram .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath14 is invariant under translations of @xmath1 and reflection of @xmath1 in the origin .",
    "matheron @xcite asked the following question , known as the _ covariogram problem _ , to which he conjectured an affirmative answer when @xmath30 .",
    "_ is a convex body in @xmath2 determined , among all convex bodies and up to translation and reflection in the origin , by its covariogram ? _",
    "the focus on covariograms of convex bodies is natural .",
    "one reason is that mallows and clark @xcite constructed non - congruent convex polygons whose overall chord length distributions ( allowing the directions of the chords to vary as well ) are equal , thereby answering a related question of blaschke .",
    "thus the information provided by the covariogram can not be weakened too much .",
    "moreover , there exist non - congruent non - convex polygons , even ( see @xcite ) horizontally- and vertically - convex polyominoes , with the same covariogram , indicating that the convexity assumption also can not be significantly weakened .",
    "interest in the covariogram problem extends far beyond geometry .",
    "for example , adler and pyke @xcite ask whether the distribution of the difference @xmath31 of independent random variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 , uniformly distributed over a convex body @xmath1 , determines @xmath1 up to translations and reflection in the origin . up to a constant , the convolution @xmath34 is just the probability density of @xmath31 , so the question is equivalent to the covariogram problem . in @xcite",
    ", the covariogram problem also appears in deciding the equivalence of measures induced by brownian processes for different base sets .",
    "a detailed historical account of the covariogram problem may be found in @xcite .",
    "the current status is as follows , in which  determined \" always means determined by the covariogram among all convex bodies , up to translation and reflection in the origin .",
    "averkov and bianchi @xcite showed that planar convex bodies are determined , thereby confirming matheron s conjecture .",
    "bianchi @xcite proved , by a long and intricate argument , that three - dimensional convex polyhedra are determined .",
    "it is easy to see that centrally symmetric convex bodies are determined .",
    "( in the symmetric case , convexity is not essential ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  4.4 ) for this result , due to cabo and jensen . )",
    "goodey , schneider , and weil @xcite proved that most ( in the sense of baire category ) convex bodies in @xmath2 are determined .",
    "nevertheless , the covariogram problem in general has a negative answer , as bianchi @xcite demonstrated by constructing convex polytopes in @xmath2 , @xmath35 , that are not determined .",
    "it is still unknown whether convex bodies in @xmath36 are determined .",
    "none of the above uniqueness proofs provide a method for actually reconstructing a convex body from its covariogram .",
    "we are aware of only two papers dealing with the reconstruction problem : schmitt @xcite gives an explicit reconstruction procedure for a convex polygon when no pair of its edges are parallel , an assumption removed in an algorithm due to benassi and dercole @xcite . in both these papers ,",
    "all the exact values of the covariogram are supposed to be available .",
    "in contrast , our first set of algorithms take as input only a finite number of values of the covariogram of an unknown convex body @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , these measurements are corrupted by errors , modeled by zero mean random variables with uniformly bounded @xmath38th moments , where @xmath38 is at most six and usually four .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath37 is determined by its covariogram , has its centroid at the origin , and is contained in a known bounded region of @xmath2 , which for convenience we take to be the unit cube @xmath39^n$ ] .",
    "we provide two different methods for reconstructing , for each suitable @xmath40 , a convex polytope @xmath5 that approximates @xmath37 or its reflection @xmath41 .",
    "each method involves two algorithms , an initial algorithm that produces suitable outer unit normals to the facets of @xmath5 , and a common main algorithm that goes on to actually construct @xmath5 .    in the first method ,",
    "the covariogram of @xmath37 is measured , _",
    "multiple times _ , at the origin and at vectors @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where the @xmath44 s are mutually nonparallel unit vectors that span @xmath2 . from these measurements , the initial algorithm  noisycovblaschke constructs an @xmath45-symmetric convex polytope @xmath46 that approximates @xmath47 , the so - called blaschke body of @xmath37 .",
    "( see section  [ prelim ] for definitions and notation . )",
    "the crucial property of @xmath47 is that when @xmath37 is a convex polytope , each of its facets is parallel to some facet of @xmath47 .",
    "it follows that the outer unit normals to the facets of @xmath5 can be taken to be among those of @xmath46 .",
    "algorithm  noisycovblaschke utilizes the known fact that @xmath48 , evaluated at @xmath49 , equals the brightness function value @xmath50 , that is , the @xmath51-dimensional volume of the orthogonal projection of @xmath37 in the direction @xmath27 .",
    "this connection allows most of the work to be done by a very efficient algorithm , algorithm  noisybrightlsq , designed earlier by gardner and milanfar ( see @xcite ) for reconstructing a @xmath45-symmetric convex body from finitely many noisy measurements of its brightness function .",
    "the second method achieves the same goal with a quite different approach .",
    "this time the covariogram of @xmath37 is measured once at each point in a cubic array in @xmath52^n$ ] of side length @xmath53 . from these measurements , the initial algorithm  noisycovdiff(@xmath54 ) constructs an @xmath45-symmetric convex polytope @xmath46 that approximates @xmath55 , the difference body of @xmath37 .",
    "the set @xmath56 has precisely the same property as @xmath47 , that when @xmath37 is a convex polytope , each of its facets is parallel to some facet of @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 is just the support of @xmath57 .",
    "the known property that @xmath58 is concave ( a consequence of the brunn - minkowski inequality ( * ? ? ? * section  11 ) ) can therefore be combined with techniques from multiple regression .",
    "algorithm  noisycovdiff(@xmath54 ) employs a gasser - mller type kernel estimator for @xmath57 , with suitable kernel function @xmath54 , bandwidth , and threshold parameter .",
    "the output @xmath46 of either initial algorithm forms part of the input to the main common algorithm  noisycovlsq .",
    "the covariogram of @xmath37 is now measured _ again",
    "_ , once at each point in a cubic array in @xmath52^n$ ] of side length @xmath53 .",
    "using these measurements , algorithm  noisycovlsq finds a convex polytope @xmath5 , each of whose facets is parallel to some facet of @xmath46 , whose covariogram fits best the measurements in the least squares sense .",
    "much effort is spent in proving that these algorithms are strongly consistent .",
    "whenever @xmath37 is determined among convex bodies , up to translation and reflection in the origin , by its covariogram , we show that , almost surely , @xmath59 as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes hausdorff distance .",
    "( if @xmath37 is not so determined , a rare situation in view of the uniqueness results discussed above , the algorithms still construct a sequence @xmath62 whose accumulation points exist and have the same covariogram as @xmath37 . ) from a theoretical point of view , this completely solves problem  1 .",
    "naturally , the consistency proof leans heavily on results and techniques from analytic convex geometry , as well as a suitable version of the strong law of large numbers .",
    "some effort has been made to make the proof fairly self - contained , but some arguments from the proof from @xcite that algorithm  noisybrightlsq is strongly consistent are used in proving that algorithm  noisycovblaschke is strongly consistent .",
    "one such argument rests on the bourgain - campi - lindenstrauss stability result for projection bodies .    with algorithms for problem  1 in hand , we move to problem  2 , assuming that @xmath37 is an unknown convex body satisfying the same conditions as before .",
    "the basic idea is simple enough : use ( [ prc ] ) and the measurements of @xmath63 at points in a suitable cubic array to approximate @xmath57 via its fourier series , and feed the resulting values into the algorithms for problem  1 .",
    "however , two major technical obstacles arise .",
    "the new estimates of @xmath57 are corrupted by noise that now involves dependent random variables , and a new deterministic error appears as well .",
    "a substitute for the strong law of large numbers must be proved , and the deterministic error controlled using fourier analysis and the fortunate fact that @xmath57 is lipschitz . in the end the basic idea works , assuming that for suitable @xmath64 , measurements of @xmath63 are taken at the points in @xmath65 contained in the cubic window @xmath66^n$ ] , whose size increases with @xmath8 at a rate depending on the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "the three resulting algorithms , algorithm  noisymod@xmath68lsq , algorithm  noisymod@xmath68blaschke , and algorithm  noisymod@xmath68diff(@xmath54 ) , are stated in detail and , with suitable restrictions on @xmath67 , proved to be strongly consistent under the same hypotheses as for problem  1 .",
    "our final three algorithms , algorithm  noisymodlsq , algorithm  noisymodblaschke , and algorithm  noisymoddiff(@xmath54 ) cater for problem  3 .",
    "again there is a basic simple idea , namely , to take two independent measurements at each of the points in the same cubic array as in the previous paragraph , multiply the two , and feed the resulting values into the algorithms for problem  2 .",
    "no serious extra technical difficulties arise , and we are able to prove that the three new algorithms are strongly consistent under the same hypotheses as for problem  2 .",
    "this provides a complete theoretical solution to the phase retrieval problem for characteristic functions of convex bodies .    to summarize :    @xmath69 for problem  1 , _ first _ use _ either _ algorithm  noisycovblaschke _ or _ algorithm  noisycovdiff(@xmath54 ) and _ then _ use algorithm  noisycovlsq .",
    "@xmath69 for problem  2 , _ first _ use _ either _ algorithm  noisymod@xmath68blaschke _ or _",
    "algorithm  noisymod@xmath68diff(@xmath54 ) and _ then _ use algorithm  noisymod@xmath68lsq .",
    "@xmath69 for problem  3 , _ first _ use _ either _ algorithm  noisymodblaschke _ or _ algorithm  noisymoddiff(@xmath54 ) and _ then _ use algorithm  noisymodlsq .",
    "these results can also be viewed as a contribution to the literature on the associated uniqueness problems .",
    "they show that if a convex body is determined , up to translation and reflection in the origin , by its covariogram , then it is also so determined by its values at certain countable sets of points , even , almost surely , when these values are contaminated with noise .",
    "similarly , the characteristic function of such a convex body is also determined by certain countable sets of noisy values of the modulus of its fourier transform .",
    "our noise model is sufficiently general to apply to all the main cases of practical interest : zero mean gaussian noise , poisson noise ( unbiased measurements following a poisson distribution , sometimes called shot noise ) , or poisson noise plus zero mean gaussian noise .",
    "however , the main text of this paper deals solely with theory . with the exception of corollary  [ cordiffe ] and remark  [ cordifferem ] , where the method of proof leads naturally to rates of convergence for algorithm  noisycovdiff(@xmath54 ) and hence for the two related algorithms for phase retrieval ,",
    "the focus is entirely on strong consistency .",
    "further remarks about convergence rates , sampling designs , and implementation issues have been relegated to the appendix .",
    "much remains to be done .",
    "we believe , however , that our algorithms will find applications .",
    "for example , baake and grimm @xcite explain how the problem of finding the atomic structure of a quasicrystal from its x - ray diffraction image involves recovering a subset of @xmath2 called a window from its covariogram , and note that this window is in many cases a convex body .",
    "we are grateful to jim fienup , david mason , and sara van de geer for helpful correspondence and to referees for some insightful suggestions that led to significant improvements .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     since the least squares problem ( [ obj1 ] ) is nonlinear , it is important to control the number of variables , that is , the number of facets of the approximation @xmath46 to the blaschke body @xmath47 of @xmath37 . to a large extent",
    ", algorithm  noisycovblaschke already does this ; the potential @xmath70 variables that would otherwise be required ( see @xcite ) is , as experiments show , considerably reduced .",
    "in fact , if there is little or no noise , a linear programming version of the brightness function reconstruction program due to kiderlen ( see @xcite , where it is stated for measurements without noise ) is not only even faster , but also produces approximations @xmath46 to @xmath47 with at most @xmath71 facets . beyond this",
    ", there is the possibility of using the pruning techniques discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3.3 ) .",
    "there is also the possibility of changing the variables in the least squares problem ( [ obj1 ] ) .",
    "a convex polytope @xmath72 whose facet outer unit normals are a subset of a prescribed set @xmath73 of directions can be specified by the vector @xmath74 such that @xmath75 the possible advantage in using these variables arises from the fact that , by the brunn - minkowski inequality ( cf .",
    "* section  11 ) ) , the covariogram @xmath76 turns out to be @xmath77-concave ( i.e. , @xmath78 is concave ) on its support in the combined variable @xmath79 .",
    "one may therefore try solving the problem @xmath80 over the variables @xmath81 . by expanding the square in ( [ obj1app ] ) , approximating the sums by integrals , and using the prkopa - leindler inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  7 ) , the objective function can be seen as an approximation to the difference of two log - concave functions .",
    "these admittedly weak concavity properties may help .",
    "regularization is often used to improve fourier inversion in the presence of noise .",
    "we expect this to be of benefit in implementing the phase retrieval algorithms , where preliminary investigations indicate that regularization will allow the restriction on the parameter @xmath67 to be considerably relaxed .    corresponding to the two basic approaches to reconstruction ",
    "one via the blaschke body and one via the difference body ",
    "there are two different sampling designs . for the former ,",
    "measurements are made first at the origin and at points in a small sphere centered at the origin , and then again at points in a cubic array .",
    "for the latter , measurements are made twice , each time at points in cubic array .",
    "these sampling designs are a matter of convenience , at least regarding the cubic array",
    ". it should be possible to use a variety of different sets of measurement points , at least for reconstructing from covariogram measurements , with appropriate adjustments in the consistency proofs ."
