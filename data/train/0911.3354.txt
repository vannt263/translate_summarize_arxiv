    "the subject of _ additive combinatorics _ has grown enormously over the last ten years and now comprises a large collection of tools with many applications in number theory and elsewhere , for example in group theory and theoretical computer science .",
    "it has often been thought a little difficult to specify to an outsider exactly what the subject _ _ is__. however the following point of view seems to be gradually crystallising : additive combinatorics is the study of _ approximate mathematical structures _ such as approximate groups , rings , fields , polynomials and homomorphisms .",
    "it is interested in what the right definitions of these approximate structures are , what can be said about them , and what applications this has to other parts of mathematics .",
    "this article has three main aims .",
    "firstly , we wish to introduce the above point of view to a general audience , focussing in particular on the basic theory of approximate groups and approximate fields .",
    "secondly , we wish to sketch some beautiful applications of these ideas .",
    "one of them has to do with the beautiful picture on the cover ( for which we thank cliff reiter ) of an apollonian circle packing .",
    "it is classical that the radii of these circles are all reciprocals of integers .",
    "we will describe work of bourgain , gamburd and sarnak giving upper bounds for the number of circles at `` depth @xmath1 '' which have radius the reciprocal of a prime .",
    "thirdly , we wish to hint at the extraordinary variety of different areas of mathematics which have started to interact with additive combinatorics : geometric group theory , analytic number theory , model theory and point - set topology are just the ones we shall mention here .",
    "what we offer here is merely a taste of this viewpoint of additive combinatorics as the theory of approximate structure and of its applications .",
    "we do not touch on the theory of approximate polynomials ( a.k.a .",
    "the theory of gowers norms ) or say much at all about approximate homomorphisms , or anything about the many applications of these two notions .",
    "these topics will be covered in detail in forthcoming lecture notes of the author @xcite .",
    "before we can define an approximate group , we need to recall what an exact one is .",
    "we shall be concerned with finite groups , and we shall be working inside some ambient group @xmath2 , so that it makes sense to talk about multiplication of elements and taking inverses .",
    "if @xmath3 is a finite set then we shall write @xmath4 and @xmath5 . later on",
    "we shall see more general notations such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 whose meaning , we hope , will be evident . the following proposition , whose proof is an exercise in undergraduate group theory , gives various criteria for @xmath8 to be a subgroup or something very closely related .",
    "[ subgroup - char ] let @xmath8 be a finite subset of some ambient group @xmath2",
    ". then we have the following statements",
    "we mean simply the proportion of all pairs @xmath9 for which @xmath10 also lies in @xmath8 . ] :    1 .",
    "@xmath11 , with equality if and only if @xmath12 for some subgroup @xmath13 and some element @xmath14 ; 2 .",

    "@xmath25 , with equality if and only if @xmath24 for some subgroup @xmath13 .",
    "this would be a rather odd proposition to see formulated in an algebra text .",
    "however each of the statements ( 1 )  ( 6 ) has been constructed as an inequality in such a way that one may ask when equality approximately holds . before we can talk about such approximate variants , however , we need to know how approximate they will be . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath26 ; larger values of @xmath27 will indicate more approximate , and thus less structured , objects is very different from the theory when , for example , @xmath28 . in the former setting ,",
    "these approximate notions of subgroup constitute very small perturbations of the exact characterisations of proposition [ subgroup - char ] , and it turns out ( though is not always trivial to prove ) that the approximate objects so defined are small perturbations of the exact objects characterised by proposition [ subgroup - char ] . in conversation tao and",
    "i tend to refer to this regime as `` the 99% world '' , an expression i would not be averse to popularising . in this paper @xmath27 will be much larger , causing the theory to become much richer .",
    "tao and i call this the `` 1% world '' although the parameter @xmath27 could be anything between @xmath29 ( say ) and some small power of @xmath30 . ] .",
    "consider , then , the following list of properties that a finite set @xmath3 might enjoy .    1 .   @xmath31 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath32 ; 3 .",
    "the number of quadruples @xmath18 with @xmath19 is at least @xmath33 ; 4 .",

    "@xmath34 ; 6 .",
    ".    now these are by no means as closely equivalent as the properties ( 1 )  ( 6 ) in proposition [ subgroup - char ] .",
    "let us give an example in which the ambient group is @xmath36 , and where we use additive rather than multiplicative notation .",
    "take @xmath37 .",
    "then it is easy to check that ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are both satisfied with any @xmath38 , as @xmath39 , this being because there are @xmath40 solutions to @xmath41 with @xmath42 . on the other hand the sumset",
    "@xmath43 contains the numbers @xmath44 for each pair @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "since these numbers are all distinct , we have @xmath47 , which means that if @xmath1 is sufficiently large depending on @xmath27 then ( 2 ) is not satisfied at all .",
    "rather remarkably , however , there is a sense in which the concepts ( 1 )  ( 6 ) are all _ roughly _ the same . to say what we mean by that ,",
    "we introduce the following notion of rough equivalence rather than @xmath48 is a little arbitrary .",
    "the notion of rough equivalence will , in this survey , be applied to classes of sets ( such as ( 1 )  ( 6 ) here ) which are invariant under conjugation , in which case whether we multiply on the left or on the right in the definition makes little difference . ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath8 and @xmath49 are two finite sets in some ambient group and that @xmath26 is a parameter .",
    "then we write @xmath50 to mean that there is some @xmath16 in the ambient group such that @xmath51 .",
    "we say that @xmath8 and @xmath49 are roughly equivalent with parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the remarkable fact alluded to above is the following . for every choice of @xmath52",
    ", suppose that some set @xmath8 satisfies condition ( @xmath53 ) in the list above with parameter @xmath27 .",
    "then there is a set @xmath49 satisfying condition ( @xmath54 ) with parameter @xmath55 ( some polynomial in @xmath27 ) such that @xmath56 .",
    "of particular note is the fact that the weak `` statistical '' properties ( 3 )  ( 6 ) imply the apparently more structured properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the proof of this is not at all trivial and the main content of it is the so - called balog - szemerdi - gowers theorem @xcite , generalised to the nonabelian setting in the fundamental paper of tao @xcite , as well as a collection of `` sumset estimates '' which , in the abelian case , i refer to collectively as _ ruzsa calculus _ @xcite .",
    "these estimates of ruzsa have such a classical role in the theory that we record two of them , in the abelian setting , here : we will mention these two again later on .",
    "[ ruzsa - sumsets ] suppose that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are finite sets in some ambient abelian group",
    ". then @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the original paper @xcite , the book @xcite or the notes @xcite may be consulted for more details .",
    "the first estimate is true in general groups but adapting the second requires care : see @xcite .",
    "it might be remarked that for many pairs ( @xmath53 ) and ( @xmath54 ) the correspondence between the relevant properties is a little tighter than mere rough equivalence , and often this can be useful .",
    "we shall not dwell on this point here . in the paper of tao",
    "just mentioned one finds what has become the `` standard '' notion of an approximate group .",
    "[ approx - gp - def ] suppose that @xmath8 is a finite subset of some ambient group and that @xmath26 is a parameter .",
    "then we say that @xmath8 is a @xmath27-approximate group if it is symmetric ( that is , if @xmath61 then @xmath62 , and the identity lies in @xmath8 ) and if there is a set @xmath63 in the ambient group with @xmath64 and such that @xmath65 .",
    "this notion , it turns out , is roughly equivalent to ( 1 ) - ( 6 ) above .",
    "it has certain advantages over ( 1 ) - ( 6 ) , for example as regards its behaviour under homomorphisms .",
    "it is also clear that an approximate group in this sense enjoys good control of iterated sumsets .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath66 , which means that @xmath67 , and similarly @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the set of all products @xmath70 with @xmath71 . from now on , when we speak of an approximate group , we will be referring primarily to definition [ approx - gp - def ] .",
    "with this discussion in mind , we can introduce what might be termed the rough classification problem of approximate group theory .",
    "[ rough - classification - problem ] consider the collection @xmath72 of all @xmath27-approximate groups @xmath8 in some ambient group @xmath2 .",
    "is there some `` highly structured '' subcollection @xmath73 such that every @xmath74 is roughly equivalent to some set @xmath75 with parameter @xmath76 , where @xmath76 depends only on @xmath27",
    "?    this question has been addressed in a great many different contexts , starting with the freman - ruzsa theorem @xcite , which gives an answer for subsets of @xmath36 . here , it is possible to take @xmath73 to consist of the so - called _ generalised arithmetic progressions _",
    ", that is to say sets @xmath49 of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 , the quantities @xmath79 are `` lengths '' and @xmath80 . note in particular that , even in the highly abelian setting of the integers @xmath36 , approximate groups are a more general kind of object than genuine subgroups .",
    "that is , the theory of approximate groups , even up to rough equivalence , is a little richer than the theory of finite subgroups of @xmath36 ( which is in fact a rather trivial theory ) .",
    "the remarkable feature of the freman - ruzsa theorem is that the theory is not _",
    "much _ richer , in the sense that generalised progressions remain highly `` algebraic '' objects . here is a list of other contexts in which the question has been at least partially answered :    * abelian groups @xcite ; * nilpotent and solvable groups @xcite ; * free groups @xcite ; * linear groups @xmath81 @xcite , + @xmath82 @xcite , + @xmath83 @xcite , + @xmath84 ( sketched in @xcite ) , + `` bounded '' subsets of @xmath85 including @xmath86 @xcite , + @xmath0 @xcite , + @xmath87 @xcite + and @xmath88 for various other @xmath89 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is generally felt that approximate groups in quite general contexts can be controlled by objects built up from genuine subgroups and nilpotent objects ; this has been found in all of the examples just mentioned and is suggested by the famous theorem of gromov on groups with polynomial growth @xcite and the recent quantitative formulation of it due to shalom and tao @xcite .",
    "quite precise suggestions along these lines have been made by helfgott , lindenstrauss and others : more information on this can be found on tao s blog @xcite .    before leaving this subject , we remark that even ( perhaps _ especially _ ) in the abelian case the issue of the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath27 is far from being resolved .",
    "no examples are known to rule out the possibility that , with the right definition of the highly - structured class @xmath73 , @xmath76 can be taken to be polynomial in @xmath27 . in particular this is conjectured when the ambient group @xmath2 is @xmath90 , the countable infinite vector space over the field of two elements , and @xmath73 consists of ( finite ) subgroups of @xmath2 .",
    "this assertion ; see @xcite . ] is known as the _ polynomial freman - ruzsa conjecture _ @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "it is equivalent to the following question which , for many years , i have tried to advertise to those for whom the word cohomology holds no fear .",
    "suppose that @xmath91 is a map such that @xmath92 takes on at most @xmath27 different values as @xmath93 range over @xmath94 .",
    "is it true that @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is linear and @xmath97 takes on at most @xmath55 different values ?    it is a very easy exercise to obtain such a statement with @xmath98 but , so far as i know , no serious improvement of this bound has ever been obtained . ] .",
    "fortified by the experiences of the last section , one might attempt to come up with a sensible notion of an approximate _ ring_. a natural one , based perhaps on ( 2 ) in the previous section , is as follows : if @xmath8 is a finite subset of some ambient ring @xmath99 , we say that it is a @xmath27-approximate ring if @xmath100 and @xmath101 . here",
    ", of course , @xmath102 and @xmath103 as before .",
    "if @xmath104 is actually a field ( or an integral domain , which embeds into its field of fractions ) then we refer to @xmath8 as an approximate field , noting that approximate closure under division is essentially automatic in view of the rough equivalence of the notions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of approximate group .",
    "the study of approximate rings and fields was initiated in a paper of erds and szemerdi @xcite who proved ( though not in this language ! ) that a @xmath27-approximate subfield of @xmath36 must have size @xmath105 .",
    "they in fact conjectured that the right bound is @xmath106 for any @xmath107 , but this is so far unresolved ; the best exponent so far obtained is @xmath108 , a result of solymosi @xcite .",

    "the arguments on page 384 of @xcite , though they are phrased in a more limited context , essentially prove that every approximate subfield ( in an arbitrary ambient field ) must be roughly equivalent to a genuine finite subfield .",
    "this unifies the results of erds - szemerdi and solymosi with theorem [ bkt - theorem ] .",
    "in fact something similar is true for approximate rings , at least provided the ambient ring @xmath99 does not have `` too many '' zero divisors .",

    "then it is possible to establish an intriguing dichotomy : if @xmath130 then either @xmath131 or @xmath132 here , @xmath133 refers to the set of all @xmath134 with @xmath9 .",

    "if equality does not occur then we may find a nontrivial solution to @xmath136 , which means that @xmath137 .",

    "straightforward additional arguments allow one to show that this subfield and @xmath120 are roughly equivalent .",
    "the original argument of @xcite is different and specific to @xmath113 but rather fun and , given the preceding discussion , it is not hard to say a few meaningful words about it .",

    "the sets @xmath149 arising from ( boundedly many ) successive applications of this operation may also be shown to be small .",
    "now simple averaging arguments ( using nothing more than the fact that @xmath150 ) show that @xmath113 has dimension at most 100 ( say ) as a `` vector space '' over @xmath8 ; that is , there exist @xmath151 such that @xmath152 now @xmath153 can not be a `` basis '' for @xmath113 over @xmath8 since otherwise we would have @xmath154 , contrary to the assumption that @xmath115 is prime . thus there",

    "worse still , to handle @xmath171 helfgott must in fact classify approximate subfields of @xmath175 , and this involves the additional possibility of sets which are close to the subfield @xmath113 .    for the sake of exposition , we will assume in the first instance that @xmath8 is a genuine finite subgroup of @xmath172 ; our task is to show that @xmath8 contains a large upper - triangular subgroup .",
    "when we have sketched how helfgott s argument looks in this case we will remark on the additional technicalities required to make the argument `` robust '' enough to apply to @xmath27-approximate groups .    the key idea in helfgott s argument , referred to by subsequent authors as _ trace amplification _ , involves examining the set of traces @xmath176 we will sketch a proof that a large subset of this set of traces is a @xmath177-approximate subfield of @xmath111 of size greater than @xmath178 .",

    "now a linear algebra computation ( lemma 4.2 of @xcite ) confirms that if @xmath181 are elements without a common eigenvector in @xmath182 then the map @xmath183 is at most two - to - one .",
    "this , or rather the fact that something like this holds , is not at all surprising : indeed knowledge of @xmath184 together with the fact that @xmath185 provides four pieces of information which , generically , ought to more - or - less determine the four entries of the matrix @xmath16 . if @xmath8 contains two such elements",

    "we play around a little with traces .",
    "such playing around is most productive if , in the basis just selected , there is an element @xmath203 with @xmath204 .",
    "the absence of such an element is another degenerate situation to analyse , and once again one can check that @xmath8 must be either upper - triangular or else equal to one of the dihedral groups , each of which has an index two abelian subgroup .    now let us note that @xmath205 this being a consequence of the fact that @xmath206 let us also note that @xmath207 where @xmath208 and @xmath209 , which means that @xmath210 in particular @xmath211 which , by ruzsa s inequalities ( theorem [ ruzsa - sumsets ] , applied with @xmath212 and @xmath213 ) implies that @xmath214 .",

    ".    _ orbit - stabiliser theorem . _ if @xmath8 is a group and if @xmath217 then we used the fact that the size of the conjugacy class @xmath218 containing @xmath16 and that of the centraliser @xmath219 are related by @xmath220 .",
    "in fact we only used the inequality @xmath221 , giving us an element with large centraliser , and here is a simple way of seeing why this holds : all of the conjugates @xmath222 , @xmath61 , lie in @xmath218 , and so by the pigeonhole principle there must be distinct elements @xmath223 , @xmath224 , with @xmath225 .",
    "but then the elements @xmath226 , @xmath227 , centralise @xmath16",
    ". now if @xmath8 is only a @xmath27-approximate group then this argument does not quite work , as there is no well - defined notion of conjugacy class .",
    "however a similar pigeonhole argument nonetheless gives us an element with large centraliser , since the conjugates @xmath228 are all constrained to lie in @xmath229 , a set of size at most @xmath230 .",

    "_ a more interesting point concerns the location of an element of @xmath8 which , in a given basis , has no zero entries .",
    "whilst this might not be _ a priori _",
    "possible if @xmath8 is only an approximate group , it _ is _ possible to find such an element in @xmath69 for some bounded @xmath1 ( independent of the approximation parameter @xmath27 ) , and this is good enough for helfgott s purposes .",
    "this is a special case of a nice lemma of eskin , mozes and oh @xcite called `` escape from subvarieties '' .",
    "the point is that the group @xmath231 generated by @xmath8 , if it is not almost upper - triangular , contains an element with no zero entries ",
    "indeed this fact was used in the above sketch . in other words , @xmath231 is not contained in the subvariety of @xmath172 defined by @xmath232 the eskin - mozes - oh result states that in such a situation we can find `` evidence '' for the non - containment of @xmath231 inside @xmath233 by taking just a bounded number , depending only on @xmath233 , of products of @xmath8 .",
    "it seems , then , that certain types of argument  in some sense those involving `` bounded length '' computations in the ambient group  adapt very well from the traditional group theory setting to approximate groups .",
    "at the moment we do not have anything approaching a precise formulation of this principle and indeed at present the passage from the `` exact '' to the approximate is as much an art as a science .",
    "nonetheless , there seems to be merit in looking for `` bounded length '' proofs in traditional group theory which might be adapted to the approximate setting .",
    "perhaps this is as good a place as any to mention the remarkable recent paper of hrushovski @xcite in which tools from model theory have been applied to the study of approximate groups .",
    "the ramifications of that paper are not yet completely clear , but it looks as though theorem 1.3 of that paper together with some structure theory of algebraic groups ought to lead , without too much difficulty , to a proof of the following statement .",

    "we move on now to applications of the theory of approximate groups . in this section",
    "we discuss the paper @xcite of bourgain and gamburd .",
    "this paper concerns _",
    "expander graphs_. for the purposes of this discussion these are @xmath235-regular graphs @xmath236 on @xmath1 vertices for which there is a constant @xmath237 such that for any set @xmath63 of at most @xmath238 vertices of @xmath236 , the number of vertices outside @xmath63 which are adjacent to @xmath63 is at least @xmath239 .",
    "expander graphs share many of the properties of random regular graphs , and this is an important reason why they are of great interest in theoretical computer science .",
    "there are many excellent articles on expander graphs ranging from the very concise @xcite to the seriously comprehensive @xcite .",
    "a key issue is that of constructing explicit expander graphs , and in particular that of constructing _ families _ of expanders in which @xmath240 and @xmath241 are fixed but the number @xmath1 of vertices tends to infinity .",
    "many constructions have been given , and several of them arise from cayley graphs .",
    "let @xmath2 be a finite group and suppose that @xmath242 is a symmetric set of generators for @xmath2 .",
    "the cayley graph @xmath243 is the @xmath235-regular graph on vertex set @xmath2 in which vertices @xmath16 and @xmath244 are joined if and only if @xmath245 .",
    "such graphs provided some of the earliest examples of expanders @xcite . a natural way to obtain a family of such graphs",
    "is to take some large `` mother '' group @xmath246 admitting many homomorphisms @xmath247 from @xmath246 to finite groups , a set @xmath248 , and then to consider the family of cayley graphs @xmath249 as @xmath247 ranges over a family of homomorphisms .",
    "the work under discussion concerns the case @xmath250 , which of course admits homomorphisms @xmath251 for each prime @xmath115 . for certain sets @xmath248 , for example @xmath252 or @xmath253 spectral methods from the theory of automorphic forms may be used to show that @xmath254 is a family of expanders .",
    "see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "these methods depend on the fact that the group @xmath255 has finite index in @xmath250 and they fail when this is not the case , for example when @xmath256 in @xcite lubotzky asked whether the corresponding cayley graphs in this and other cases might nonetheless form a family of expanders , the particular case of being known as his `` 1 - 2 - 3 question '' .",
    "the paper of bourgain and gamburd under discussion answers this quite comprehensively , showing that all that is required is that the group generated by @xmath257 is not _ virtually abelian _ ( contains a finite index abelian subgroup ) .",
    "we will sketch the proof in the case that @xmath257 generates a nonabelian free subgroup of @xmath258 .",
    "this is essentially the most general case , since the kernel of the natural homomorpism from @xmath259 to @xmath260 is free and has index at most @xmath261 in @xmath259 .",

    "the argument is almost identical in any other case . in this case , then , @xmath267 is the graph on vertex set @xmath171 in which @xmath16 is joined to @xmath244 if and only if @xmath268 is one of the elements @xmath269 or @xmath270 considered modulo @xmath115 . supposing that @xmath271 , each of these graphs is @xmath272-regular .",

    "the reader may be interested to see a proof , using the `` ping - pong '' technique of felix klein , that that the subgroup of @xmath258 generated by these @xmath8 and @xmath49 is indeed free .",
    "consider the natural action of @xmath8 and @xmath49 on the projective plane @xmath274 .",
    "write @xmath275 and @xmath276 and observe that @xmath63 and @xmath277 are disjoint and _ jouent au ping pong _ , that is to say @xmath278 and @xmath279 ( the origin of the name should be clear  the `` players '' @xmath8 and @xmath49 hit the domains @xmath63 and @xmath277 back and forth  as should the preference for the french term rather than the cumbersome `` play table tennis with one another '' . ) if the group generated by @xmath8 and @xmath49 is not free , then some nontrivial reduced word in @xmath8 and @xmath49 is equal to the identity , where `` reduced word '' means a finite word of the form @xmath280 with @xmath281 .",

    "consider the operator @xmath293 given by @xmath294 , that is to say @xmath295 the matrix consisting of the functions @xmath296 defined by @xmath297 if @xmath298 and @xmath167 otherwise .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath199 are of course @xmath301 , @xmath302 , and it is a very well - known and easy to establish fact that the @xmath303th moment @xmath304 is equal to @xmath1 times @xmath305 , the number of closed walks of length @xmath303 from the identity to itself .",
    "it follows that we have @xmath306 note in particular that @xmath307 , since all the terms are non - negative . at first glance",
    "it looks as though the only way to use to bound @xmath308 away from zero would be to get rather precise estimates on @xmath305 , and in particular one would at the very least want to show that @xmath309 .",
    "however a remarkable observation , used earlier in related contexts by sarnak and xue @xcite and gamburd @xcite , comes into play .",
    "this is that any eigenspace of the laplacian is @xmath171-invariant , where the action of @xmath171 on @xmath310 is the right - regular one given by @xmath311 . in other words , any such eigenspace has the structure of a representation of @xmath171 and thus , by basic representation theory , decomposes into irreducible representation of @xmath171 .",
    "but by a classical theorem of frobenius all such representations have dimension at least @xmath312 .",
    "this means that @xmath313 for some @xmath314 , and hence from we in fact have the bound @xmath315 this enables a meaningful spectral gap ( lower bound on @xmath308 ) to be obtained from somewhat weaker upper bounds on @xmath305 .",
    "the main new content of @xcite , then , is to obtain those upper bounds on @xmath305 , the number of walks of length @xmath303 starting and finishing at the identity , for appropriate @xmath316 .",
    "a nice way of thinking about these walks is in terms of _ convolution powers _ of the probability measure @xmath317 on @xmath171 , where @xmath318 if @xmath319 and @xmath167 otherwise .",
    "this measure @xmath320 is a very singular or `` spiky '' probability measure , supported on just the four points @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "now the convolution @xmath321 is supported on words of length at most two in @xmath269 and @xmath270 , or alternatively those @xmath16 in the graph @xmath267 which can be reached from the identity by a path of length two , the value of @xmath322 being @xmath323 times the number of paths of length two from the identity to @xmath16 .",
    "similarly higher convolution powers @xmath324 give @xmath325 times the number of paths of length @xmath316 from the identity to @xmath16 .",
    "the idea of the proof is to examine these convolution powers , showing that they become progressively more `` spread out '' until , for suitable @xmath316 , @xmath326 vaguely resembles the uniform measure @xmath327 which assigns weight one to each point of @xmath171 .",
    "then , in particular , @xmath328 , meaning that @xmath329 . combined with , this is enough to establish the desired spectral gap .",
    "the notion of a probability measure @xmath330 on @xmath171 being `` spread out '' may be quantified using the @xmath331-norm @xmath332 the @xmath331-norm of a delta measure @xmath333 is @xmath334 , which is huge , whilst that of the uniform measure @xmath327 is equal to one , the smallest value possible by the cauchy - schwarz inequality .",
    "it is not hard to show that convolution can not increase the @xmath331-norm , and so we have the chain of inequalities @xmath335 the aim is to show that this sequence is , in fact , rather rapidly decreasing . roughly speaking",
    "one shows that @xmath336 for some @xmath337 ; this @xmath338 turns out to be an appropriate choice to substitute into in order to reach the desired conclusions .",
    "it turns out that this sequence gets off to a rather good start .",
    "this is a consequence of an observation of margulis @xcite , namely that the freeness of the subgroup of @xmath258 generated by @xmath8 and @xmath49 persists to some extent even when reduced modulo @xmath115 .",
    "indeed let us take a reduced word @xmath339 with @xmath340 and suppose that this equals the identity when reduced modulo @xmath115 , that is to say in @xmath171 .",
    "lifting back up to @xmath258 we have @xmath341 but the freeness of the lifted group means that @xmath342 , and thus in order to be congruent to the identity mod @xmath115 the matrix @xmath343 must have at least one entry of size at least @xmath344 .",
    "but by some simple matrix inequalities this is impossible provided that @xmath345 for some absolute constant @xmath237 .",
    "it follows that the subgroup of @xmath171 generated by @xmath8 and @xmath49 is `` free up to words of length @xmath346 '' . in terms of the cayley graphs @xmath267 this means that up to retracing steps there is a unique walk of length @xmath316 between the identity and @xmath16 for any @xmath347 and for any @xmath348 .",
    "this implies that the measures @xmath349 , @xmath350 are already rather spread out . to quantify this ( and in particular to deal with the issue of `` retracing steps '' ) a result of kesten concerning random walks in the free group",
    "may be applied .",
    "the conclusion is that@xmath351 for some @xmath352 .",
    "this is good progress on the way to and represents a significant improvement on the initial bound @xmath353 .",
    "it is convenient to imagine , for the rest of the argument , that all probability measures @xmath330 on @xmath2 have the form @xmath354 for some set @xmath3 , the `` support '' of @xmath330 . whilst this is clearly not true , various ( somewhat technical ) decompositions into level sets",
    "may be used to reduce to this case .",
    "for such a measure we have @xmath355 and so the bound corresponds to @xmath356 , certainly a reasonable level of spreadoutness .",
    "the rest of the argument , which constitutes the heart of the paper , involves examining the convolution powers between @xmath357 and @xmath358 for a suitable @xmath359 , the aim being to establish .",
    "an application of the `` dyadic pigeonholing argument '' , used to great effect by bourgain in many papers , is employed : if @xmath360 is much larger than 1 , this means that the sequence can not decay too rapidly between @xmath357 and @xmath358 and so there must be two convolution powers @xmath349 and @xmath326 , @xmath361 , such that @xmath362 .",
    "let us be deliberately vague about the meaning of @xmath363 here .",

    "thus , being even rougher at this point , @xmath369 for some approximate group @xmath370 .",

    "in this section we discuss work of bourgain , gamburd and sarnak @xcite .",
    "the goal of _ sieve theory _ , traditionally viewed as a part of analytic number theory , is to find prime numbers or at least to say something about them .",
    "historically , the sieve arose through work of brun and merlin on the twin prime problem , that is to say the problem of finding infinitely may primes @xmath115 such that @xmath383 is also prime . whilst this remains a famous open problem , approximations to it have been found .",
    "for example , brun established the following result .",
    "there are infinitely many integers @xmath1 such that @xmath384 has at most @xmath385 prime factors .",
    "much later , chen @xcite replaced @xmath385 by @xmath386 . one way of stating this type of result is as follows : there are infinitely many @xmath1 for which both @xmath384 is a 3-_almost prime _ , that is to say a positive integer with at most 3 prime factors .",
    "the aim of @xcite is to discover almost primes in more exotic locales , and specifically in _ orbits _ of linear groups .",
    "we will sketch a proof of the following result .",
    "[ bgs - special - case ] let @xmath8 and @xmath49 be two matrices in @xmath258 generating a free subgroup . then there is some @xmath387 such that this group contains infinitely many @xmath387-almost prime matrices matrices , the product of whose entries is @xmath387-almost prime .",
    "henceforth we shall say `` almost prime '' instead of `` @xmath387-almost prime for some @xmath387 '' .",
    "we remark that in the specific case we focussed on in the last section , when @xmath265 and @xmath266 , the theorem as stated follows from classical sieve theory of the type used to prove brun s theorem . indeed",
    "( for example ) @xmath388 , and the product of the entries here is @xmath389 , which will be almost prime for infinitely many @xmath1 by a simple variant of brun s analysis .",

    "we start with a ( very ) elementary discussion of what a sieve is .",
    "suppose one has a finite set @xmath63 of integers and that one wishes to find primes or almost primes in @xmath63 . the most nave way to do this would be to try to adapt the sieve of eratosthenes , using the inclusion - exclusion principle to compute @xmath390 where @xmath391 is the set of elements of @xmath63 which are divisible by @xmath89 .",
    "unfortunately it is well - known that , even when @xmath63 is an extremely simple set such as @xmath392 , it is not generally possible to evaluate @xmath393 sufficiently accurately to avoid the error terms in this long sum blowing up . in this simple case",

    "these other sieves are generally cleverly weighted versions of the sieve of eratosthenes , but we will not dwell upon their construction here . a typical example of `` reasonably nice '' information about @xmath393 would be @xmath397 for all squarefree @xmath398 , where @xmath399 is some pleasant multiplicative function and the error @xmath400 is small in the sense that @xmath401 for some @xmath352 .",

    "what is meant by `` almost prime ''  that is , how many prime factors these numbers will have  depends on how large we can take @xmath405 as well as on the so - called dimension of the sieve , which has to do with the average size of the quantities @xmath406 .",
    "we will not delay ourselves by expanding upon the details here .",
    "let us instead refer the reader to @xcite for the precise formulation convenient to the application there and to the book @xcite or the unpublished notes @xcite for a more wide - ranging discussion of sieves in general with full proofs .",

    "what we have just said applies only to @xmath425 when @xmath115 is a prime , and for the sieve one must understand @xmath391 when @xmath89 is a general squarefree number . to do this requires the establishment of theorem [ bg - theorem ] for the family @xmath426 , where now @xmath89 ranges over all squarefrees and not just over primes .",
    "the broad scheme of the proof is the same , but every single ingredient must be generalised to the more general setting , starting from the classification of approximate subrings of @xmath427 .",
    "the situation here is more complicated because this ring will in general have many approximate subrings , namely @xmath428 with @xmath429 .",
    "one of the main technical results of @xcite ( occupying some 20 pages ) is the statement that , very roughly speaking , these are the only approximate subrings of @xmath427 .",
    "although this is a deeply technical argument of a type that this author would struggle to summarise meaningfully even to an expert audience , it might be compared with the 92-page proof @xcite of the corresponding assertion without the squarefree assumption on @xmath89 .",
    "thankfully this is not required for the present application .",
    "once the classification of approximate subrings of @xmath427 for @xmath89 squarefree is in place a suitable analogue of helfgott s argument is applied to roughly classify approximate subgroups of @xmath88 .",
    "even the statement of this result ( proposition 4.3 in the paper ) is rather technical .",
    "finally , the majority of the argument outlined in the last section in the case @xmath89 prime goes over without substantial change .",
    "this concludes our discussion of the proof of theorem [ bgs - special - case ] . to conclude this survey",
    ", we wish to mention a beautiful application , mentioned in the original paper @xcite and in other articles such as @xcite , of these nonlinear sieving ideas .",
    "this has to do with apollonian packings such as the one in the attractive image above .        for a very pleasant and gentle introduction to apollonian packings ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "referring to figure [ figure-1 ] , inside each circle is an integer which represents the curvature of that circle , or in other words the reciprocal of the radius .",
    "some of the number theory associated with the integers that arise in this way is discussed in the letter @xcite where , for example , it is shown that infinitely many of these curvatures are prime and in fact that there are infinitely many touching pairs of circles with prime curvature .",
    "now a pleasant exercise in euclidean geometry gives a theorem of descartes , namely that the relation between the four integers @xmath430 inside four mutually touching circles is given by @xmath431 examples of quadruples @xmath432 which are related in this way and easily visible in the picture are @xmath433 and @xmath434 .",
    "take a quadruple @xmath435 of touching circles with curvatures @xmath436 there is another circle @xmath437 tangent to @xmath438 and @xmath439 , and it has curvature @xmath440 . to find a general relation between @xmath441 and @xmath442",
    "we may note that @xmath443 are roots of regarded as a quadratic in @xmath441 and thereby obtain the relation @xmath444 this may of course be written as @xmath445 that is , if one starts with some fixed vector such as @xmath446 then one may obtain another quadruple of curvatures of circles in the apollonian packing by applying the matrix @xmath447 by playing the same game with @xmath448 and @xmath449 we can make the same assertion with the matrices @xmath450 @xmath451 and @xmath452 this leads naturally to consideration of the orbit @xmath453 , where @xmath454 every vector in which consists entirely of curvatures of circles in the apollonian packing .",
    "this puts us in a situation very similar to that studied in theorem [ bgs - special - case ] , except now we appear to be dealing with a subgroup of @xmath455 rather than of @xmath258 .",
    "it turns out , however , that this situation is essentially a two - dimensional one in disguise , and for this we need to add to the list of areas of mathematics we touch upon by hinting at lie theory and special relativity !",
    "the matrices @xmath456 belong to @xmath457 , the subgroup of @xmath455 consisting of @xmath458 matrices with determinant one which preserve the quadratic form @xmath459 ( cf . ) . by the standard theory of quadratic forms ( over @xmath166 )",
    "this is equivalent to the lorentz form @xmath460 , and so we may identify @xmath461 with the orthogonal group @xmath462 preserving this latter form .",
    "but it is very well - known that this group admits @xmath463 as a double cover : this is because the set @xmath464 may be identified with the set of @xmath465 hermitian matrices @xmath466 with determinant 1 via @xmath467 and so any @xmath468 gives rise to an element of @xmath462 via the transformation @xmath469 .    by lifting to this double cover",
    "the group @xmath259 can be lifted to a subgroup of @xmath470)$ ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ bgs - special - case ] goes through with relatively minimal changes , although once again the group generated by @xmath471 and @xmath472 contains unipotents and so , if the aim is simply to find infinitely many circles or pairs / quadruples of touching circles with almost - prime curvatures , more elementary approaches work just as well .",
    "those elementary approaches do not , however , give sharp quantitative results , whereas the techniques we have sketched do .",
    "to explain one such result , imagine figure [ figure-1 ] being generated as follows",
    ". start with the outer circle ( which has curvature @xmath473 ) and the three largest inner circles , with curvatures 13 , 21 and 24 .",
    "this is the _",
    "first generation_. the second generation consists of those circles touching three from the first generation : they have curvatures 28,37,61 and 124 .",
    "the third generation contains those new circles touching three circles from either the first or the second generations : these have curvatures 45 , 60 , 69 , 93 , 124 , 132 , 133 , 156 , 220 , 292 , 301 and 325 .",
    "carry on in this vein : the @xmath1th generation will contain @xmath474 circles .    the number of circles at generation @xmath1 which have prime curvature is bounded by @xmath475 , for some absolute constant @xmath119 .",
    "we conclude by remarking that there are some very interesting unsolved questions connected with apollonian packings @xcite . in that paper",
    "the very interesting question is raised of whether , in figure [ figure-1 ] , a positive proportion of all positive integers appear as curvatures .",
    "j.  bourgain has recently indicated to me that he and elena fuchs have obtained new information on this question .",
    "see also @xcite for an asymptotic formula for the number of circles in the packing of curvature at most @xmath63 .",
    "it seems that the question of describing this set of integers more precisely remains open : are they given , from some point on , by finitely many congruence conditions ?",
