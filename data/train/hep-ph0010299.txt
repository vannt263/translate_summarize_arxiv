    "the superkamiokande atmospheric neutrino data @xcite , provide very strong evidence for neutrino conversion , _",
    "i.e. _ that neutrinos produced in well defined flavour eigenstates partially convert to different flavour eigenstates at the detection point .",
    "a similar conclusion follows from the long standing solar neutrino puzzle @xcite and a number of other atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "altogether , solar and atmospheric data indicate the need for and conversions , respectively .",
    "there are a number of neutrino flavour conversion mechanisms  @xcite , and the simplest one is that of neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "although in some circumstances neutrino oscillations do not imply neutrino masses  @xcite , typically they do .",
    "due to the fact that neutrino mass and flavour eigenstates should , in general , differ , quantum interference effects can lead to sizeable neutrino conversion rates either from large mixing angles or from resonant matter effects . in this scenario ,",
    "the solar and atmospheric neutrino puzzles are interpreted as strong evidence for nonzero neutrino masses .",
    "the present data can be summarised as follows : the atmospheric neutrino puzzle is best solved by @xmath2 with close to maximal mixing ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4  ( ev)@xmath5  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the solar neutrino puzzle requires @xmath6 oscillations , where @xmath7 is some linear combination of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "while the atmospheric neutrino data indicate large mixing angles , the current solar neutrino data do not indicate a unique solution .",
    "the mixing is either very small ( @xmath10 ) or quite large ( @xmath11 ) , while the value of @xmath12 varies from @xmath13  ev@xmath5 to @xmath14  ev@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino oscillation interpretation of the solar and atmospheric data only fixes the mass - squared splittings amongst the the neutrinos , not the overall mass scale .",
    "in fact , the data are equally well explained if all neutrino masses were almost degenerate at some arbitrarily large value .",
    "there are , however , constraints on neutrino masses from tritium beta decay experiments at the level of 3 ev  @xcite , while cosmological considerations impose limits on the sum of all stable neutrino species , namely @xmath15  ev . there are also a number of results from the non - observation of neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite , which imply that @xmath16 ev where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the neutrino mass eigenstates , with masses @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the components of @xmath21 in the @xmath17 basis ( @xmath22 ) .    barring the possibility of quasi - degenerate neutrinos an / or exotic neutrino conversion mechanisms , all existing data are easily satisfied if one assumes that the heaviest neutrino weighs around @xmath23  ev and is an almost fifty - fifty mixture of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while the second to heaviest neutrino weighs from @xmath24  ev to @xmath25  ev and is either composed of mostly the orthogonal combination of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with a very small @xmath21 component or an almost fifty - fifty mixture of this @xmath8 and @xmath9 linear combination and @xmath21 .",
    "there is no preferred value for the mass of the lightest mass eigenstate , which can even be massless as far as the experimental constraints are concerned . in this case",
    "neutrino masses are very small , with the heaviest neutrino about 10@xmath26 times lighter than the lightest charged fermion .    what is wrong with neutrino masses ?",
    "navely , they are not allowed by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this is very easy to see : given the field content and the gauge symmetries of the sm , it is impossible to write down a renormalizable neutrino mass term .",
    "however , if the sm is regarded as the effective low - energy limit of some , unknown , higher energy theory , neutrino majorana masses are not forbidden and do arise after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the neutrino majorana mass comes from a dimension-5 term in the lagrangian triplets with small vacuum expectation values  @xcite .",
    "we will not consider this approach here . ]",
    "@xmath27 such that , after electroweak symmetry breaking , one generates a neutrino mass matrix , @xmath28 given by @xmath29 here @xmath30 is a lepton doublet field ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 is the higgs doublet field and @xmath33 is an arbitrary mass scale .",
    "it is somehow related to the unknown high energy theory of which the sm is an effective theory .",
    "the @xmath34 are dimensionless couplings and @xmath35  gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . note that eq .",
    "( [ 5-dim ] ) leads to a majorana mass term which explicitly violates the lepton number symmetry , @xmath36 .",
    "this is not a surprise since both lepton and baryon number ( @xmath37 ) are accidental global symmetries of the sm , and there is no reason they should be conserved by the higher energy theory . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath38 is violated in the sm via electroweak quantum effects , while @xmath39 is still conserved .",
    "furthermore , if string theory has anything to do with reality , it seems to predict that there are no exactly conserved global symmetries , and the only way to realize @xmath39 as a conserved symmetry is to assume it is gauged .",
    "alternatively , renormalizable neutrino dirac masses are easily allowed within the sm if right - handed fermions uncharged under the sm gauge group exist .",
    "these are often referred to as right - handed neutrinos , and , even though they are not present in the sm , they can be added without causing any trouble ( as they are sm singlets ) .",
    "furthermore , their existence is quite natural in the context of a number of extended electroweak models as well as certain grand unified theories ( guts )  @xcite . in their presence , the neutrinos acquire a dirac mass like all the charged fermions , from a yukawa coupling to the higgs field @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of right - handed neutrinos ) are right - handed fermions .",
    "as far as the sm gauge group is concerned , @xmath43 is completely unconstrained , since @xmath44 are 1 singlets  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath45 are the couplings of the sterile neutrinos to the lepton and higgs doublet fields , leading to a neutrino dirac mass matrix given by @xmath46 .",
    "a crucial fact is that right - handed neutrinos can also have majorana masses , which are unprotected by the gauge symmetry .",
    "this means that the right - handed neutrino majorana mass term comes from a renormalizable term in the lagrangian ( indeed from a relevant operator ) , which is completely unrelated to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the terms involving the right - handed neutrino are @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the right - handed neutrino majorana mass matrix .",
    "the simultaneous presence of @xmath45 and @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ right - handed ] ) implies that @xmath36 is violated .    in summary , the presence of right - handed neutrinos not only allows a dirac mass term for the neutrino sector , but , in general , also violates @xmath36 .",
    "most importantly , it introduces a new energy scale into the sm lagrangian .",
    "the task of neutrino mass modeling is then to explain the origin of eq .",
    "( [ 5-dim ] ) and of the @xmath34 and @xmath33 values or , alternatively , to determine the @xmath45 and @xmath49 values in eq .",
    "( [ right - handed ] ) .    in this paper , we present a neutrino mass model which combines the above alternatives to generate neutrino masses and contains the least amount of new ingredients added to the sm . in sec .",
    "2 we define what is meant by `` new ingredients '' ( or physics beyond the sm ) , and argue in which sense the solar and atmospheric neutrino puzzles imply new physics .",
    "in sec .  3 we present this `` minimalistic '' model and show how it satisfies the current experimental data . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss whether the minimalistic model allows for an explanation of the baryon - to - entropy ratio of the universe , via the elegant and economical mechanism of leptogenesis , and in sec .",
    "5 we conclude .",
    "generating neutrino masses requires the addition of extra degrees of freedom and/or interactions to the sm  @xcite , _ i.e. , _ new physics .",
    "new physics is characterized by an energy scale above which the sm ( and , perhaps , quantum field theory ) is no longer appropriate and a different theory is required to describe physical processes involving this energy scale .",
    "this , of course , is what is meant by saying that the sm is the effective theory of some higher energy theory .",
    "new physics usually manifests itself in the sm lagrangian in the form of irrelevant operators , suppressed by powers of the scale of new physics .",
    "the presence of these operators can be detected either via the observation of rare or forbidden processes which are suppressed in the sm thanks to accidental symmetries which need not be preserved by the high energy theory , such as proton decay and @xmath50 , or via precision measurements of sm observables .",
    "independent of any hint for new physics , it is clear that the sm is an effective theory because it disregards the gravitational force , which certainly exists .",
    "this means that , _ if nothing else happens , _ the sm has to break down at the energy scale where gravitational effects become relevant , _",
    "i.e. , _ the planck scale , @xmath51  gev .",
    "this means that , independent of whether there is some `` intermediate '' new physics , higher dimensional operators suppressed by the planck scale should be present , unless forbidden by some deep , fundamental reason .",
    "these `` @xmath52 '' operators are harmless .",
    "for example , a dimension-6 term @xmath53 violates @xmath37 and @xmath36 , and leads to proton decay .",
    "however , the expected proton lifetime due to this operator is many orders of magnitude away from the current experimental reach @xcite .",
    "the same is true of operators which mediate @xmath54 and other rare / forbidden processes .",
    "as first noted by barbieri , ellis , and gaillard @xcite in the context of @xmath55 guts , and further explored by the authors of @xcite in the case of the sm , `` quantum gravity '' effects also generate eq .",
    "( [ 5-dim ] ) , namely , @xmath56 should be considered as a `` standard '' term of the sm lagrangian .",
    "what is most remarkable is that , for @xmath34 of order 1 , the entries of the majorana neutrino mass matrix are of the order @xmath57  ev  @xmath58  ev .",
    "this is in the acceptable mass range which solves the solar neutrino puzzle  @xcite !",
    "this implies the possibility that the solar neutrino puzzle can be solved without assuming any new physics between the electroweak and the planck scale .",
    "in contrast , the atmospheric neutrino puzzle , when interpreted as evidence for a neutrino mass , is unambiguous proof of new physics , beyond the sm , at some intermediate energy scale .    an elegant way of understanding the smallness of neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism @xcite , which takes advantage of eq .",
    "( [ right - handed ] ) . since the right - handed neutrino mass scale is expected to be much larger than the electroweak scale it can be integrated out at energies smaller than this new mass scale , so that the effective lagrangian again looks like eq .",
    "( [ 5-dim ] ) , with @xmath59 the order of magnitude for the elements of @xmath49 required to solve the atmospheric neutrino puzzle is such that @xmath60 . for typical values of the yukawa couplings ( @xmath61 ) , one obtains @xmath62  gev@xmath63  gev .",
    "there are many other , indirect , hints for new physics .",
    "most importantly , there is the problem of the stability of the electroweak scale .",
    "solving this so - called hierarchy problem , means , roughly , understanding why the electroweak scale ( _ e.g. _ the sm higgs mass ) is so much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "its most popular solutions involve low - energy susy , which stabilizes scalar masses by eliminating quadratic divergences or , more recently , the existence of `` large '' extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the latter assumes that the fundamental scale of quantum gravity is indeed the weak scale , and that the apparent weakness of the gravitational force is due to the fact that gravity propagates in a multidimensional space - time , while sm fields are trapped in a four - dimensional space - time .",
    "other hints of new physics include the apparent unification of gauge couplings at around @xmath64  gev , which seems to be an indication that the sm gauge group may be the `` left - over '' symmetry of some high energy gut symmetry , and the hierarchy of the charged fermion masses which may be considered as a hint for horizontal flavour symmetries broken at intermediate energy scales .    in summary , there are many `` theoretical '' hints for new physics at very different energy scales , in particular the weak scale ( @xmath65  gev ) and the gut scale ( @xmath66  gev ) .",
    "all of these energy scales have been used to generate neutrino masses .",
    "first note that one can generate eq .",
    "( [ 5-dim ] ) without invoking new mass scales above the weak scale , _ i.e. _ using @xmath67 in such a way that @xmath34 are very small .",
    "one example is susy with r - parity violation  @xcite , where @xmath34 are given as a product of very suppressed couplings .",
    "another possibility is to make use of the gut scale and @xmath52 operators to induce right - handed neutrino masses of the order @xmath68 , such that the heaviest neutrino mass is of order @xmath69  ev @xcite .    in the case of susy",
    ", it has recently been pointed out that one can generate small majorana or dirac neutrino masses from susy breaking @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the neutrino masses are small for the same reason that the susy - preserving @xmath70-term is much smaller than the unknown high energy scale ( say @xmath71 ) .",
    "finally , theories with large extra dimensions can generate very small dirac neutrino masses ( eq .  ( [ yukawa ] ) ) by assuming that the sm singlet fermions live in the extra dimensions and therefore their couplings in the sm `` brane '' are volume suppressed  @xcite .",
    "this means that neutrino masses are small for the same reason that the gravitational force is weak .",
    "such theories , however , typically require that @xmath36 be conserved , unless it is broken in distant branes or by a totally different mechanism , such as r - parity violation  @xcite .",
    "this is required in order to forbid terms similar to eq .",
    "( [ 1/m_pl ] ) but with @xmath72  tev , which would lead to unacceptably large neutrino masses .",
    "it is clear that small neutrino masses are `` expected '' on theoretical grounds .",
    "however , the rich variety of theoretical options available illustrates that neither their scale nor the magnitude of neutrino mixing angles can be firmly predicted from first principles  @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to focus on what appears to be the most economical way to solve the neutrino puzzles through neutrino - mass - induced oscillations , ignoring indirect beyond the sm hints .",
    "the motivation for this is two - fold : first , neutrino masses are the only direct experimental hint for beyond the sm physics and second , it is important to establish how contrived the new physics has to be in order to explain the current solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "in order to minimize the amount of new physics invoked , we will take advantage of the already present quantum gravity contribution to neutrino masses , which navely implies that all three neutrinos weigh around @xmath25  ev .",
    "though not the favored solution , this is enough to account for the current solar neutrino data  @xcite .",
    "we need , however , to generate at least one neutrino mass of order @xmath73  ev in order to solve the atmospheric neutrino puzzle .",
    "the most economical way of doing this is to add _ one _ right - handed neutrino , at the appropriate mass scale @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "this point was also emphasised in @xcite , where a single right - handed neutrino is used to explain the atmospheric data , while the solar data was explained by gut scale effects .",
    "why one right - handed neutrino , and not three ?",
    "first of all , in order to stick to the minimalistic approach , the smallest number of right - handed neutrinos is to be added .",
    "second , and most important , there is , _ a priori , _ no correct number of right - handed neutrinos since , as gauge singlets , they do not contribute to sm gauge anomalies  @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that these sm singlet right - handed fermions are very heavy and decouple from the low energy theory .",
    "their only effect in the laboratory is indirect , through the generation of a majorana neutrino mass , even though , as will be discussed in the next section , they may also play some role in the generation of the baryon number of the universe .",
    "the sm lagrangian with @xmath52 operators and one right - handed neutrino contains @xmath74 integrating out the right handed fermion , the neutrino mass matrix is ( after electroweak symmetry breaking ) @xmath75 the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath34 , which are of order one , should be determined from the atmospheric and solar data . in order to simplify things ,",
    "we rewrite @xmath77 as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , such that @xmath82 .",
    "the reason for this notation will become clear shortly .    neglecting the @xmath52 term ,",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is @xmath83 this matrix has a projective structure  @xcite , giving rise to one nonzero eigenvalue @xmath84 and two zero eigenvalues .",
    "however , since lepton number has been broken , there is no reason for any of the neutrino masses to be zero .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that nonzero masses to all neutrinos arise at the two - loop level .",
    "however , these are significantly smaller than the contribution from the @xmath52 operator we are considering here @xcite .",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalue @xmath84 is @xmath85 in the flavour basis which , because of unitarity , is determined by only two mixing angles  @xcite , which we refer to as @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this nonzero eigenvalue is the one that will be used to solve the atmospheric neutrino puzzle .",
    "if we choose @xmath88  ev , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , both the atmospheric neutrino data and the bounds from reactor neutrino experiments  @xcite are easily satisfied .",
    "we now proceed to show that the addition of the @xmath52 term easily yields the just - so solution to the solar neutrino puzzle . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we initially assume that the @xmath52 term is `` democratic , '' _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath91 where @xmath92  ev , and @xmath93 is some order one coefficient .",
    "it is easy to see that eq .",

    "this is due to the democratic nature of the @xmath52 operator .",
    "note that one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ demo ] ) as @xmath94 in such a way that it mimics the mass matrix one obtains in models with two right - handed neutrinos .",

    "first , the atmospheric data and the reactor constraints are , as expected , solved by choosing @xmath108 and @xmath84 as in the previous case where the effect of the @xmath52 term was neglected ( @xmath121 ) .",

    "first , the right - handed neutrinos may be coupled to the inflaton field and therefore are still produced at the time of reheating even if @xmath180 , as long as they are lighter than the inflaton field itself .",
    "second , the right - handed neutrinos may be produced during preheating @xcite , even with relatively low reheating temperatures ( @xmath181 ) due to the non - perturbative decay of large inflaton oscillations during reheating .",
    "this mechanism is particularly efficient for fermions @xcite . in both cases",
    "it seems plausible that our minimalistic neutrino mass model can generate the observed baryon - to - entropy ratio . according to estimates of @xcite",
    ", this will happen as long as @xmath182  gev and the reheating temperature is `` large '' ( @xmath183  gev ) .",
    "the superkamiokande atmospheric neutrino data strongly suggest that effects beyond the standard model of particle physics are present in the leptonic sector .",
    "the simplest extension of the sm which explains the atmospheric neutrino data is to assume that neutrinos are massive , and that they mix . in light of this strong experimental evidence ,",
    "it is natural to assume that the long standing solar neutrino puzzle is also solved by neutrino oscillations . in this paper , we have emphasized that nonrenormalizable @xmath52 operators provide a solution to solar neutrino puzzle without the addition of any new physics . on the other hand ,",
    "the atmospheric neutrino puzzle _ requires _ the existence of new physics at intermediate energy scales .",
    "the most `` economical '' model requires one new field at this new physics scale , which can be anywhere between @xmath0  gev and @xmath1  gev for typical yukawa coupling values .",
    "it is important to note that , _ as far as solving the neutrino puzzles is concerned _ , this simple model is just as successful as other more complex models .",
    "a potential drawback of the model is that mixing angles are not predicted , so that the required relative magnitudes of the yukawa coupling has to be put in by hand in order to satisfy the atmospheric neutrino data . in particular",
    "the right - handed neutrino needs to couple to @xmath8 and @xmath9 with equal strength , while the coupling to @xmath21 has to be somewhat suppressed .",
    "however , as we have shown ( fig .  [ all_four ] ) ,",
    "the present experimental constraints on @xmath184 can still be accommodated without difficulty by assuming that the yukawa couplings are picked completely at random , in the spirit of neutrino mass `` anarchy '' @xcite . within this perspective ,",
    "all mixing angles easily arise from random yukawa couplings and random coefficients for the @xmath52 operator , and the only input to the model is the value of @xmath84 .",
    "this situation may well change in the near future if @xmath145 is constrained to be very small .",
    "the idea that the solar neutrino puzzle may be evidence for `` quantum gravity '' effects will be severely tested in the near future .",
    "the `` just - so '' solution ( @xmath185  ev@xmath5 ) is already somewhat disfavoured by the solar neutrino data  @xcite , while values of @xmath186  ev@xmath5 are still acceptable @xcite in the recently revealed `` quasivacuum '' region @xcite . however , the borexino experiment , which is to start data taking next year , will thoroughly explore @xmath187  ev@xmath5 and large mixing in a standard solar model independent way @xcite .",
    "it is safe to say that , after a few years , these values of @xmath12 will be either confirmed or definitively ruled out .",
    "furthermore , the minimalistic model also predicts hierarchical neutrino masses , such that the sign of the `` atmospheric '' mass - squared difference @xmath188 is positive .",
    "this possibility will be definitively tested at a future neutrino factory @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank martin hirsch , steve king , magda lola , and apostolos pilaftsis for useful and enlightening conversations , while adg acknowledges the hospitality of ific during his stay in valncia , where this work was initiated .",
    "this work was supported by dgicyt under grant pb98 - 0693 and by the tmr network grants erbfmrxct960090 and hprn - ct-2000 - 00148 of the european union .",
