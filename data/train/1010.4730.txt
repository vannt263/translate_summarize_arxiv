    "advances in experimental techniques in recent years have made possible the controlled growth and characterization of magnetic chains on non - magnetic crystal surfaces .",
    "such chains can be made as thin as monoatomic , i.e. , their cross - section consists of a single atom , while they are usually a few nanometers or tens of nanometers long ; they grow , e.g. , at terrace step edges , in the `` trenches '' of ( 110 ) surfaces or as inclusions in surface alloys @xcite , so that their structure is rather stable , and they can be studied by a number of spin - sensitive techniques including spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy or x - ray magnetic circular dichroism . magnetic chains , as all magnetic nanostructures , bear technological relevance due to the prospect of miniaturization of magnetic bits for information storage . particularly appealing , however , in chains",
    "is that their geometry is defined by only one parameter , the length , which makes it easier to interpret their physical properties @xcite .    at such small sizes magnetic states at low - temperature equilibrium consist of a single domain and the possibility of",
    "information storage relies solely on the bistability of the magnetization , which is a consequence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy . at low enough temperature the direction of magnetization",
    "is trapped close to a local energy minimum for some time before it is reversed by thermal flutuations to another minimum , pointing along the opposite direction . above some characteristic _ blocking _ temperature @xmath0",
    ", however , there is a transition to a situation where the magnetization fluctuations are too intense for a stable state to be formed . as the size of the nanomagnets is below the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the transition is not a genuine phase transition but rather a smooth crossover .",
    "these effects are strongly size dependent . in many cases",
    ", larger system size leads to higher blocking temperature , reaching the curie temperature in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , in two - dimensional @xcite and even more in one - dimensional systems , upon increasing the system size @xmath1 , the entropy leads the magnetic state to a multi - domain structure at even low temperatures .",
    "the characteristic length , at which this effect sets in , is the magnetization correlation length @xmath2 ; thus , the effect of magnetic bistability in chains is physically limited by the requirement @xmath3 .",
    "the temperature - driven magnetization reversal dynamics of nano - particles has been tradidionally studied within the stoner - wohlfarth model @xcite , where the particle magnetization is approximated by a single `` macro - spin '' of rigid magnitude .",
    "however , it is known that excited states departing from the macro - spin approximation can play a significant role even at sizes of a few nanometers @xcite , while another mechanism sets in , namely reversal through domain nucleation and domain wall propagation @xcite ; the latter mechanism has been seen also in elongated particles @xcite , and should be even more relevant in chains @xcite .",
    "spin dynamics simulations of magnetic nanostructures are based on a parametrization of the spin - dependent part of the total energy and usually follow one of two paths : either that of a quantum heisenberg model or the one of a classical heisenberg model .",
    "it is well - known that the quantum model exhausts computational resources at relatively small system sizes , as the hilbert space increases exponentially with the number of atoms , therefore for system sizes of 50 or 100 atoms only the classical model is practically available .",
    "however , there are also physical situations where the quantum heisenberg model is not applicable , in particular magnetic systems on metallic surfaces .",
    "the quantum model is based on the assumption of half - integer or integer spins that interact with each other .",
    "this is the case with spins on an insulating surface , such as mn chains on cun @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "magnetic atoms on metallic surfaces are characterized by non - integer or non - half - integer spin values , which are actually average values of the spin operator on superposition states of the magnetic atoms with the substrate continuous spectrum . in this picture , where substrate electrons hop on and off the magnetic atoms , the spin states are blurred out compared to the sharp eigenstates of the quantum heisenberg model . in addition , damping of the magnetic excitations into electron - hole pairs emerges , with concequences in g - shift and frequency - dependent magnetization lifetime @xcite .",
    "this , together with temperature effects , causes decoherence of the magnetic states and thus the quantum heisenberg model is not applicable any more ; possibly a classical model , founded on the principles of adiabatic spin dynamics @xcite , is better suited in this case .",
    "actually the classical atomistic spin dynamics is based on the landau - lifshitz equations of motion , with the point - dependent magnetization being replaced by atom - dependent magnetic moments , and is a widely used tool for the study of atom - dependent nanomagnetism @xcite .    having this in mind , we use a classical spin - dynamics simulation method , implemented in our juspinx code , to study the time evolution of the magnetization in monoatomic chains . assuming a single - ion anisotropy tensor @xmath4 , inter - atomic exchange coupling constants @xmath5 between atomic spin moments @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and an external magnetic field @xmath8 , the spin - dependent excitation energy of the system is parametrized by a classical heisenberg hamiltonian of the form @xmath9 where it is implied that @xmath10 , while the factor @xmath11 compensates for the double - counting in the summation ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the atoms in the chain .",
    "we set henceforth @xmath14 , so that @xmath6 are to be understood as unit vectors along the atomic moment directions , with the modulus of the moments absorbed in the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "dipole - dipole interactions are neglected here , as we are interested in systems of not more than 100 atoms in size . in order to ensure bistability",
    ", the single - ion anisotropy should favour a particular axis ; the simplest such case is that @xmath4 is the same for each atom and its eigenvalues are @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , i.e. the anisotropy is uniaxial , so that second term of the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath18 , with the @xmath19-azis appropriately chosen along the low - energy direction . in the limit @xmath20 , there can be a further simplification , as the system behaviour is well - described by the ising model and it follows glauber dynamics @xcite .",
    "this condition is met e.g. in single chain magnets @xcite consisting usually of transition metal atoms that are stabilized and linked in a chain form by molecular ligands . however , for metallic magnetic chains on surfaces the magnetic anisotropy can take large values that are of the order of a few mev , while the exchange coupling is typiclaly one or two orders of magnitude stronger @xcite . in this case , an appropriate classical approximation to the spin dynamics is the stochastic landau - lifshitz equation of motion : @xmath21 where we have defined the effective magnetic field acting on the spin at the atomic site @xmath12 as @xmath22 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 is a damping parameter leading the system to equilibrium at zero temperature .",
    "the temperature @xmath24 enters via a stochastic fluctuating force @xmath25 , as described in appendix a. in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ll ] ) , the first term on the right - hand side is derived directly from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) , while the damping and temperature terms are phenomenologically added assuming interaction of the spins with a temperature bath .    our focus in this work is on the temperature - induced magnetization reversal of finite - length chains .",
    "it is implied that the length of the chain , @xmath1 , is considerably smaller than the correlation length @xmath2 , otherwise the magnetic configuration consists of many domains , and the bistability loses its meaning .",
    "we seek to identify the lifetime @xmath26 of a magnetic state before it is flipped to the opposite magnetization direction .",
    "the flip is caused by thermal effects only and we are interested in a `` loss of memory '' , therefore we set @xmath27 .",
    "it is expected , and found in the simulation , that @xmath28 follows to a good approximation an arrhenius law , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is interpreted as an activation energy barrier and @xmath31 as an attempt frequency ; @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant ( details on the method of calculation of @xmath26 are given in appendix a ) .",
    "we find that @xmath33 shows a deviation from a constant only at high temperatures , where the magnetization does not spend any appreciable time at a state before being reversed .",
    "what is important , however , is the dependence of @xmath30 and @xmath33 on the properties of the chain .",
    "we keep a minimal model , considering only nearest - neighbour exchange coupling @xmath34 and in most cases the same anisotropy @xmath35 at each site ( except when considering edge - anisotropy effects ) , whence the energy- and time - scales of the system are defined by @xmath36 , @xmath35 , and @xmath23 .",
    "then , a domain wall that is formed in the chain will have a width of approximately @xmath37 and a formation energy of @xmath38 ( estimated at the continuum limit @xcite of eq .",
    "[ eq : heisenberg ] ) .",
    "as we explain below , our main findings are categorized in the following regimes : ( i ) @xmath39 : the chain then behaves like a monodomain particle , as laid out already in the theory of stoner , wohlfarth and brown @xcite , with the reversal being controlled by a barrier of @xmath40 .",
    "( ii ) @xmath41 : the magnetization reversal occurs due to a domain nucleation and subsequent domain wall propagation ; the barrier entering eq .",
    "( [ eq : arrhenius ] ) is then @xmath42 .",
    "regime ( ii ) becomes relevant also for shorter chains as the anisotropy increases , especially above the so - called ising limit @xmath43 , when the domain wall becomes atomically sharp ; then even very short chains of a few atoms in length behave as in regime ( ii ) .",
    "these results are presented in section [ sec : uni ] .",
    "furthermore , in section [ sec : multi ] we investigate the possibility of different anisotropy parameters in all three axes ( i.e. , we include also an in - plane anisotropy ) ; in this case , entropic arguments imply that the attempt rate @xmath31 can be strongly affected , and this is verified by our simulations . in section [ sec : real ] we discuss our findings for realistic system parameters of co chains on pt .",
    "we conclude with a summary in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the case of surface - supported chains the easy axis of magnetization , driven by spin - orbit coupling , is either perpendicular to the chain or along the chain axis , as can be shown by symmetry arguments @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of co chains on pt @xcite or co islands and nanoclusters on pt @xcite the easy axis is perpendicular to the surface ( except in the case of chains at step edges , where there is a canting induced by the step edge environment ) @xcite . the anisotropy barrier is typically between 1 and 10  mev , strongly dependent on the cluster size or shape . in this section",
    "we assume that the anisotropy tensor possesses rotational symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the easy axis ; this particular _ ansatz _ is fulfilled in free - standing chains but is not always valid when the chain is adsorbed on a surface .",
    "thus , its approximate validity is strongly system - dependent and a more general case is investigated in section  [ sec : multi ] . as a rule of thumb",
    ", it should be more valid for chains that are contained in the first surface layer or for chains of biatomic cross section , compared to chains that are on top of the surface layer , because in the former case the in - plane asymmetry of the electron potential is smaller . other effects that we neglect here are the possibility of temperature - dependent orientation of the easy axis that has been observed in certain systems @xcite and a possible canting of the anisotropy axis for the edge atoms , which has been found experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "however , at the end of the section we discuss some effects that could occur due to increased edge anisotropy .",
    "we proceed with a presentation of our results in the case of uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "we simulated the dynamics of monoatomic chains of various lengths up to a maximum of 100 atoms , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; we chose a damping of @xmath46 .",
    "values of @xmath47 are rather extreme for supported transition - metal chains , but can be realized for example in cases of molecular magnets ( where the exchange is comparably week ) , or for unsupported chains of 4d transition metal atoms @xcite .",
    "the running time of the simulations varied , depending on the system , so that statistically reliable results could be obtained for the lifetime @xmath26 .    by fitting the arrhenius law ( [ eq : arrhenius ] ) to our simulation results we extracted @xmath30 and verified the hypothesis that the energy barrier results basically from the formation of a domain wall , if the chain is not too short .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : barrier ] show that @xmath42 holds up to the limit @xmath48 ; for smaller lengths , a deviation is seen ( in particular in the case @xmath44 , where @xmath49 ) .    .",
    "cases @xmath44 and @xmath50 are shown .",
    "the horizontal lines correspond to the analytical solution of the continuum approximation @xmath51 and agree rather well with the simulation results .",
    "for @xmath44 we see a slight decrease of @xmath52  at small lengths , indicating the onset of a transition to a stoner - wohlfarth behaviour as the length becomes comparable to the domain wall width .",
    "[ fig : barrier],width=302 ]        next we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : timedep ] simulation data on a chain of 100 spins for @xmath50 at a temperature of @xmath53 .",
    "the abscissa denotes the simulation time broken up in three time intervals ; for each interval two panels are shown . in the upper panel ,",
    "the ordinate shows the chain total magnetic moment along the easy axis ( @xmath19-axis ) , @xmath54 , as a function of time .",
    "reversal events are evident , indicated as b , d and e , when the total moment is reversed .",
    "each reversal event is relatively fast , followed by a longer time interval where the total moment is approximately stable at @xmath55 .",
    "however , we also see at a , c , and f attempted events that failed , with the total moment returning to its previous state . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : timedep ] we see a series of snapshots of the system over the same time span , visualizing the time - evolution of the site - dependent magnetization .",
    "here , the ordinate represents the position of the spin in the chain , @xmath12 , while a colour - code is used for the sign of the local @xmath56 : green for @xmath57 , blue for @xmath58 .",
    "we can see how reversal attempts start by nucleation of a spin - fliped region that either propagates throughout the chain to end in reversal , as in b , d , and e , or is annihilated in an unsuccessful attempt as in a , c , and f. we also see that in some attempts the nucleation starts at the chain edge , as in b , c , e and f , while for others it starts in the chain interior , as in a and d. although here we show a time - interval containing both kinds of nucleation , at not too high temperatures nucleation is more likely to occur at the edges than in the interior , because in the latter case two domain walls must appear simultaneously requiring the system to overcome a twice as high energy barrier ( the latter process is known as soliton - antisoliton creation and has been studied e.g.  by braun @xcite ) . for the same reason it is statistically rare for more than one nucleation regions to be present simultaneously , at least as long as @xmath59 , therefore we consider in our qualitative analysis only single nucleation events at the edges . our arguments are supported by calculations making use of a transfer - matrix approach to calculate thermodynamic properties of finite anisotropic heisenberg  @xcite showing that the edge - atoms of chains are subject to significantly stronger fluctuations than the atoms in the interior .    the reversal time itself , i.e. the time that it takes for the domain wall to propagate through the system once it is created , is in general much shorter than the magnetic - state lifetime @xmath26 .",
    "this effect is also seen experimentally by spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy of ferromagnetic nano - islands @xcite . there , fast reversal occurs during the scanning process , resulting in an image of seemingly two domains , while in reality the island is in a mono - domain state .     as a function of chain length @xmath1 for the cases @xmath44 and @xmath50 ( the latter was scaled up by a factor 10 for better legibility ) .",
    "the linear increase of @xmath26 with @xmath1 is due to the random - walk - type propagation of the domain wall after nucleation .",
    "the offset of the linear behaviour is due to the finite domain wall width .",
    "vertical lines indicate the domain wall widths in the two cases ( @xmath60 for @xmath50 , @xmath49 for @xmath44 ) .",
    "[ fig : prefactor],width=302 ]    the domain wall that occurs during nucleation performs a random walk back - and - forth in the chain , and eventually either returns to its starting point , resulting in an unsuccesful attempt , or reaches the other side , resulting in reversal .",
    "the probability for the latter to happen in a random - walk model is @xcite @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , at constant temperature , the prefactor @xmath33 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : arrhenius ] ) rises linearly with @xmath1 : @xmath62 , at least as long as @xmath63 ; this has been found also in simulations of ising - model dynamics @xcite .",
    "more accurately , going beyond the ising model , we must account for the fact that a domain wall centered at position @xmath64 is attracted to the chain edge if it is too close , i.e. , if @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "thus the domain wall propagation corresponds to a random walk only between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , so that we should observe an offset in the linear behaviour : @xmath69 this rule is reproduced by the results of our simulations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prefactor ] where the calculated lifetime is plotted against the chain length .",
    "the offset in the 1st curve ( @xmath44 ) can be seen at lengths smaller or comparable to the domain wall width ( up to 20 - 25 atoms ) . then",
    ", for @xmath48 , the switching mechanism is intermediate between nucleation and stoner - wohlfarth - like coherent rotation , and a kink in the curve @xmath70 is seen .",
    "the offset is much reduced in the 2nd curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : prefactor ] where @xmath50 , because the increased anisotropy leads to smaller @xmath71 .",
    "a deviation from the rule ( [ eq : randomwalk ] ) , in particular a saturation , is expected to begin as the chain length becomes too large approaching the correlation length",
    ". then simultaneous occurence of more that one nucleation becomes statistically more and more relevant , until eventually the space - integrated magnetization vanishes at all times .",
    "note that this linear increase ( [ eq : randomwalk ] ) of the lifetime with system size is in marked difference to the behaviour of a stoner - wohlfarth - type three - dimensional particle , where the system size ( number of atoms @xmath72 ) enters multiplicatively in the arrhenus barrier , @xmath73 , causing an exponential dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath72 . on the other hand , in the regime of validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : randomwalk ] ) ( @xmath74 ) , the arrhenius law ( [ eq : arrhenius ] ) is still valid , but with @xmath30 a constant ( i.e. , independent of the number of atoms ) .",
    "we close this section by an observation concerning the anisotropy of the edge atoms of the chain .",
    "it is well - known that , due to the different environment ( only one neighbour ) the anisotropy tensor of edge atoms , @xmath75 , can differ from the one in the chain interior , in both the direction of the principal axes and in the anisotropy strength , @xmath76 .",
    "these effects can affect the nucleation barrier as well as the nucleation frequency .",
    "however , there can be in principle an additional effect .",
    "under `` normal '' conditions a domain wall close to the edge is further attracted toward the edge and in the end expelled form the chain and annihilated , but if @xmath76 becomes large enough , it will act as a barrier against the annihilation .",
    "then the domain wall will be trapped in the interior of the chain for a longer time , eventually overcoming the barrier due to thermal fluctuations and becoming annihilated . naturally , in such a situation the nucleation is also more difficult to achieve .",
    "we derived analytically an approximate condition for such an edge barrier by considering the energy as a function of rotation of the edge spin and treating the rest of the chain in the continuum limit ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the condition reads : @xmath77 and is approximately reproduced by simulations that we performed .",
    "as we commented earlier , the magnetic anisotropy of a chain on a surface is never really uniaxial , due to the asymmetry of the environment .",
    "we take this into account in the simplest way by introducing three eigenvalues of the anisotropy tensor , @xmath78 corresponding so to say to an easy , medium , and hard axis , so that the associated energy expression becomes @xmath79 ; the site index @xmath12 has been suppressed here , and it is assumed that all sites have the same anisotropy . without loss of generality",
    "we fix @xmath80 ( the latter equality can be adjusted by a shift of the energy zero that does not affect the equations of motion , while the order of the inequalities will not affect the statistical results on the lifetime , merely the path that the spins follow to flip ) .",
    "thus , in effect the two energy minima of the single - ion anisotropy are along the @xmath81-axis , separated by a low anisotropy barrier @xmath82 if the spin rotates in the @xmath83-@xmath19-plane or by a high anisotropy barrier @xmath84 if the spin rotates in the @xmath64-@xmath19-plane ; effects of the exchange @xmath36 come on top of this as before .",
    "the question that we seek to answer is how the presence of the second anisotropy barrier affects the magnetization lifetime . to make the question more concise",
    ", we wish to compare the lifetime in the previously calculated uniaxial case , where @xmath85 , to the case @xmath86 .",
    "the minimal barrier for domain wall formation in long chains or for coherent rotation in short chains remains @xmath87 or @xmath88 respectively , so that the exponent @xmath30 in the arrhenius law ( [ eq : arrhenius ] ) should not be affected .",
    "however , the attempt frequency @xmath89 is expected to change , as the energy lanscape of the paths that connect the two minima is now different .",
    "for example , in the case of uniaxial anisotropy both bloch - type and nel - type walls are equal in energy , while in the tri - axial case one of the two types will correspond to a higher energy ; this must give a difference in entropy .",
    "as it turns out , for a given @xmath90 , the lifetime _ decreases _ with increasing @xmath91 ; our findings are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : twobarrier ] .",
    "this is at a first glance counter - intuitive : the fluctuating force enforces a random walk , regulated by the barriers , that has to climb up from an energy minimum to a maximum or saddle point before descending to the opposite minimum .",
    "increasing @xmath91 means that part of the lanscape is visited with smaller frequency , so that there are less escape paths .",
    "then part of the random - walk steps would be , so to say , waisted in attempts to climb up the high barrier . however , contrary to the case of a confined particle , the latter argument is not valid in the case of spins , because of the precessional motion",
    ". the spin trajectory has a component following the direction of the effective field ( toward the energy minimum ) , given by the damping term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ll ] ) , but the stronger , precessional part drives the spin perpendicular to the energy gradient .",
    "therefore , whenever the fluctuating field forces the spin in the direction of the high barrier , the precession drives it in the direction of the low barrier . in this way",
    ", the random - walk steps in the direction of the high barrier are not waisted but converted into random - walk steps in the direction of the low barrier .",
    "the shape of the resulting trajectory approximates an ellipsis with its long axis along the low - barrier direction .",
    "the random walk becomes in a sense more and more one - dimensional , as the difference @xmath92 increases , and it is known that random walks in one dimension propagate faster away from the starting point than in two dimensions .",
    "therefore the magnetization lifetime becomes shorter . in the limit @xmath93",
    ", the situation resembles that of an @xmath83-@xmath19-easy - plane model with a hard axis in the @xmath64 direction , which obeys the dynamics of precessional switching , long known in micromagnetics @xcite . at this limit ,",
    "even a small deviation of the spin toward the @xmath64 direction due to the fluctuating force will cause a lengthy precession around @xmath64 , in the @xmath83-@xmath19 plane , which can even last a few rotations if the damping is very low .",

    ", we find for a 50-atom chain an inverse attempt rate of @xmath118  ps and a barrier of @xmath119  mev to be substituted in the arrhenius law ( [ eq : arrhenius ] ) . assuming detection of the reversal by a scanning tunneling microscope ( see e.g. refs . @xcite and @xcite ) , and given that this method has a relatively low time resolution of the order of msec @xcite , we consider a lifetime of 1  second as reasonable for a reliable experimental analysis of spontaneous reversal .",
    "then our simulation suggests that experiments on 50-atom - long chains require temperatures of approximately 10  kelvin or lower .",
    "we have performed classical simulations of atomistic spin dynamics for supported monoatomic magnetic chains , with focus on the magnetization lifetime between temperature - induced subsequent magnetization reversals at chain lengths below the correlation length .",
    "the calculations were carried out by integrating the landau - lifshitz equation of motion of classical spin systems in the presence of stochastic forces .    in summary , the main findings of this work are the following .",
    "( i ) for long chains ( longer than the width of a domain wall ) , the lifetime is governed by an arrhenius law ( [ eq : arrhenius ] ) , with a barrier equal to the domain wall energy . for short chains , the barrier eventually becomes equal to the anisotropy energy .",
    "( ii ) for long chains , the mechanism for reversal is governed by nucleation of a region of reversed magnetization at the chain boundary , forming a domain wall , and propagation of the domain wall through the chain via a random - walk - like procedure .",
    "this yields a linear dependence of the lifetime on the chain length for chains longer than the domain - wall width , contrary to an exponential dependence that would be expected for a stoner - wohlfarth type of system .",
    "( iii ) in case of a triaxial anisotropy tensor with non - degenerate eigenvalues , i.e. , with a low and a high anisotropy barrier for magnetization reversal , the lifetime is reduced compared to the case of only a low barrier .",
    "this effect is related to the precessional motion of the spin , which tends to transform fluctuations in the high - barrier direction into fluctuations in the low - barrier direction .",
    "a triaxial anisotropy should always be present in surface - supported chains , as can be argued on the grounds of symmetry of the system .",
    "as far as fundamental science is concerned , the most important question to be answered by this type of calculations is perhaps the one of the limitations in size , time and temperature , that the classical spin dynamics is still a valid approximation , especially in metallic systems . in principle , all ingredients that enter the landau - lifshitz equations are experimentally accessible ; even more so for chains , where the geometry is simple enough so as not to introduce further arbitrariness .",
    "the result of the simulations , in particular the magnetization lifetime , is also accessible by experiment",
    ". a systematic study in this direction will be highly interesting .",

    "equation ( [ eq : ll ] ) is a stochastic differential equation with multiplicative noise which is interpreted in the stratonovich sense .",
    "the fluctuating force @xmath25 has white - noise properties , i.e.  ( i ) its time - average vanishes : @xmath120 ; ( ii ) it is fluctuating much faster than the characteristic precession time so that time - separated and space - separated fluctuations are decorrelated : @xmath121_{\\alpha}[{\\vec}{f}_j(t')]_{\\beta}\\rangle = \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\delta(t - t')$ ] , where @xmath122 denote the vector components and @xmath123 are atomic sites ; and ( iii ) its amplitude @xmath124 is connected to the damping via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath125 with @xmath32 the boltzmann constant .",
    "( [ eq : ll ] ) is integrated via a weak runge - kutta method which was suggested by milstein and tretyakov @xcite .",
    "the error scales with the step size as @xmath126 .",
    "further information can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in practice",
    ", at each runge - kutta step and for each spin at site @xmath12 , a fluctuating field @xmath127 is calculated by a set of random numbers obeying an appropriate distribution so that the above requirements ( i - iii ) are fulfilled . requirement",
    "( iii ) , in particular , guarantees that the fluctuating field intensity corresponds to the particular simulation temperature @xmath24 . the field",
    "@xmath127 acts in addition to the effective field @xmath128 and to the damping term as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ll ] ) .",
    "the random nature of @xmath127 comes into notice in the noise observed in the time - dependent magnetiation in fig .",
    "[ fig : timedep ] . for the calculation of @xmath28 , during a sufficiently long simulation time at a fixed temperature , successive time intervals @xmath129 between @xmath130 successive reversal events ( as the ones seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : timedep ] ) are recorded , and at the end averaged as @xmath131 .",
    "consider a domain wall where the magnetic moment of each atom @xmath12 has an angle @xmath132 with respect to the easy axis ( the easy axis is taken to be the same for all atoms ) .",
    "suppose that the wall is not at the interior of the chain , but close to the edge , and that it is formed by constraining the moment of the first atom ( labelled `` 0 '' ) by @xmath133 ; we accept the boundary condition at the deep interior of the chain that @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "then , a boundary condition at the edge @xmath136 corresponds to a fully formed domain wall , while @xmath137 corresponds to the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "now we take a fixed @xmath133 , @xmath138 .",
    "the resulting structure will have the form of a domain wall that has been abruptly cut at @xmath139 .",
    "if we assume in the discrete model a nearest neighbour distance of length @xmath140 and employ the continuum approximation @xcite , then the site index @xmath12 changes to a continuous variable @xmath141 and we obtain an explicit energy functional for a chain starting with a restricted angle of @xmath133 at @xmath142 : @xmath143 minimizing the energy functional under the boundary conditions @xmath144 and @xmath145 leads to an energy of the domain wall of @xmath146 which will be used as an approximation to the discrete model .",
    "next we increase the anisotropy of only the edge atom from @xmath35 to @xmath76 .",
    "this change affects only the energy of the edge atom , changing it by @xmath147 , while the configuration remains the same .",
    "we have now an energy @xmath148 for the domain wall to be trapped in the interior of the chain , this expression must have a maximum for @xmath138 , corresponding to the high - point of an energy barrier upon rotation of the edge spin .",
    "differentiation of ( [ eq : b3 ] ) with respect to @xmath133 shows that such a maximum exists under the condition @xmath149 which is equivalent to expression  ( [ eq : edge ] ) .",
