    "a technique for trapping and cooling of polar molecules on a chip has been suggested , which relies on strong coupling of rotational states of the molecule to a superconducting stripline cavity  @xcite . when trapped at a distance @xmath0 m above the cavity electrodes ,",
    "the vacuum rabi frequency @xmath1 associated with the exchange of a rotational excitation and a single microwave photon is in the order of @xmath2 khz . in combination with a comparable photon loss rate @xmath3 this coupling serves as an efficient dissipation channel for ( the in free space essentially stable ) rotational states , which is exploited for cooling the motion of a trapped molecule .",
    "cooling forces in this setup arise from the strong gradients of microwave fields in the near - field regime , in analogy to cavity - assisted laser cooling techniques discussed for atoms in the optical regime  @xcite .",
    "microwave cooling does not rely on specific electronic or collisional properties  @xcite of the molecules and therefore should be applicable for a large set of di- and also multiatomic polar molecules .",

    "comparable to @xmath41 we find that @xmath421 is reduced since the excited state population drops below its maximal value of @xmath422 . in addition , for red detuning , @xmath423 , destructive interference for @xmath424 and constructive interference for @xmath425 degrade @xmath4 cooling , while a blue detuned driving field , @xmath426 , has just the opposite effect .",
    "we conclude that cavity cooling in the saturated regime can be efficiently applied for a range of parameters fulfilling the condition @xmath427 . outside this parameter regime",
    ", excitations of the molecule on the red and blue motional sidebands as well as destructive interference effects play an important role and @xmath4 cooling no longer provides a valid description of the full cooling ( or heating ) dynamics .",
    "in this paper we have studied cavity - assisted cooling methods for a single polar molecule , which are based on a strong coupling between two rotational states of the molecule and an on - chip microwave resonator . we have shown that in the lamb - dicke limit the cooling dynamics in this system can be understood in terms of two main cooling mechanisms , namely cavity - assisted sideband cooling ( casc ) and @xmath4 cooling , interference effects between those two mechanisms and a cavity mediated thermalization channel introducing additional heating at finite temperature .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows",
    ".    @lll `` casc '' & sideband limit ( @xmath286 ) & doppler limit ( @xmath287 ) + weak driving & @xmath428 & @xmath429 + regime & @xmath430 & @xmath431 + strong driving & @xmath432 & - + regime & @xmath433 & - + `` @xmath4 cooling '' & sideband limit ( @xmath434 ) & doppler limit ( @xmath435 ) + weak driving & @xmath436 & @xmath437(\\kappa/2\\nu ) $ ] + regime & @xmath438 & @xmath439 + saturated & @xmath440 & @xmath441 + regime & @xmath442 & @xmath443 +    cavity - cooling is most efficient by employing casc , meaning that the molecule is resonantly excited on the red motional sideband followed by cavity - enhanced decay of rate @xmath116 . in the sideband resolved regime , @xmath444 , the lower bound for the final occupation number @xmath91 is then given by @xmath19 , the thermal equilibrium occupation number of the cavity mode , and translates into a final temperature of @xmath445 .",
    "the cooling rate , which scales as @xmath446 for low excitation power is optimized for a value @xmath447 where cooling rates close to the maximum value of @xmath448 can be achieved . including imperfections like the anharmonicity of the trapping potential characterized in our model by a level dependent shift of the trapping frequency @xmath449 , the cooling rate decreases as @xmath450 and eventually re - thermalization processes become dominant .",
    "our analysis shows that deviations from the ideal case @xmath451 are expected when either the frequency shift exceeds the excitation linewidth @xmath452 or when the sideband cooling rate drops below the re - thermalization rate for an insufficient driving strength @xmath41 .",
    "together with the cooling rate also the robustness of casc is optimized for @xmath453 .    in the far off - resonant regime @xmath454 as well as under resonance conditions",
    "@xmath455 cavity cooling is dominated by the mechanism of @xmath4-cooling . in the resonant case ,",
    "@xmath4 cooling is optimized in the fully saturated regime @xmath408 , where the limit @xmath451 can be reached when the cavity linewidth @xmath37 is smaller than the trapping frequency , while the result for doppler cooling @xmath456 applies in the opposite limit .",
    "the maximal cooling rate under resonance conditions is @xmath457 while in the off - resonant case the molecule is only virtually excited and the cooling rate is reduced by a factor @xmath458 . in this case , to overcome thermally activated heating processes the additional condition @xmath459 is required to reach a final occupation number close to @xmath19 . while in general it might be harder to reach the sideband resolved limit @xmath150 , @xmath356 cooling is by far less sensitive to imperfections as the condition @xmath460 is replaced by @xmath461 .    in this work",
    "we have analyzed cooling rates and final occupation numbers for a fixed set of parameters to obtain a physical understanding of the characteristics and limitations of cavity cooling in different parameter regimes . from this analysis",
    "more efficient cooling strategies can be derived by considering the possibilities to switch between different parameter regimes during the cooling process .",
    "for example , at the initial stage where the anharmonicity of the trapping potential may be most severe , @xmath4 cooling in the doppler regime offers a very robust cooling method . in a second stage , starting with the precooled molecule localized near the center of the trap , sideband cooling can then efficiently cool the molecule to the ground state . for the design of the optimal cooling strategies we should emphasize that the present setup does not only allow us to change @xmath462 and @xmath463 in time , but also offers different possibilities to control @xmath464 , @xmath465 and @xmath466 during the cooling process .",
    "for example , using a tunable cavity @xcite the cavity frequency @xmath467 and therefore also the effective decay rate @xmath464 can be controlled in a time dependent way .",
    "in addition , when the cavity is coupled off - resonantly to another dissipative solid state device , e.g. , a cooper pair box , photon states will hybridize with the lossy two - level system and a substantial modulation of the effective photon loss rate can be achieved by changing the detuning between the two systems .",
