    "particles moving in a viscous fluid induce a local flow field that affects other particles . these long - range , many - body interactions , mediated by the solvent are commonly called hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) . the presence of hi",
    "is known to affect the dynamic properties of soft matter : they modify the values of diffusion coefficients in colloidal suspensions @xcite , affect the characteristics of the coil - stretch transition in polymers @xcite , change the kinetic pathways of phase separation in binary mixtures @xcite , alter the kinetics of macromolecule adsorption on surfaces @xcite or cause the polymer migration in microchannels @xcite .",
    "they are also important in the dynamics of biological soft matter , such as dna  @xcite , proteins @xcite or lipid membranes  @xcite .",
    "the proper account of hydrodynamic interactions is thus essential in simulation studies of soft matter in the flow .",
    "unfortunately , hi depend in a complicated nonlinear way on the instantaneous positions of all particles in the system . for a system of spheres , exact explicit expressions for the hydrodynamic interaction tensors exist in the form of the power series in interparticle distances , which may be incorporated into the simulation scheme @xcite .",
    "these are however relatively expensive numerically , thus various approximations are resorted to in order to make the computations more tractable .",
    "the simplest one is based on the oseen tensor , which assumes that the particles can be regarded as point force sources in the fluid",
    ". however , the diffusion matrix constructed in this way is not suitable for the brownian dynamics simulations , because it becomes non - positive definite when separations between the particles become small .",
    "this is not only unphysical ( since the positivity of diffusion is a consequence of second law of thermodynamics ) but also leads to numerical problems in the brownian dynamics simulations , where a square root of diffusion matrix is needed .",
    "another commonly used approximation is the rotne - prager - yamakawa tensor @xcite , which takes into account all the hi terms up to @xmath1 in the expansion in the inverse distance between the particles ( where @xmath2 is the particle radius ) .",
    "nevertheless , if the particles overlap , @xmath3 , the rpy tensor again looses its positive definiteness . to avoid this ,",
    "a regularization for @xmath3 has been proposed by @xcite , which is not singular at @xmath4 and positive definite for all the particle configurations .",
    "the rotne - prager - yamakawa tensor with this regularization is by far the most popular method of accounting for hi in soft matter modelling @xcite .",
    "notably , rpy tensor is divergence - free , which considerably simplifies the application of brownian dynamics algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , when one goes beyond rpy approximation and includes many - body effects in hydrodynamic interactions , the divergence of mobility matrix becomes is non - zero and needs to be taken into account in brownian dynamics simulation schemes @xcite .",
    "the present paper takes a close look at the rotne - prager - yamakawa approximation and generalizes it in a number of ways .",
    "first , we re - derive the original rpy tensor using the direct integration of force densities over the sphere surfaces .",
    "when the spheres overlap then this method gives us automatically the regularization correction . in this way we derive the rpy regularizations not only for the translational degrees of freedom",
    "( already obtained by @xcite ) but also for rotational degrees of freedom , as well as for the shear disturbance matrix @xmath5 - another hydrodynamic tensor , which gives the response of the particles to the external shear flow .",
    "the mobility evaluated using our technique may be applied for calculation of the diffusion tensor of complex molecules @xcite using bead models which include overlapping spheres .",
    "finally , we show how these results can be generalized for other boundary conditions and corresponding propagators .",
    "we consider a suspension of @xmath6 identical spherical particles of radius @xmath2 , in an incompressible fluid of viscosity @xmath7 at a low reynolds number .",
    "the particles are immersed in a linear shear flow @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the constant velocity gradient matrix , e.g. for a simple shear flow @xmath10,\\qquad\\dot{\\gamma}=\\mathrm{{const.}}\\label{eq : shear_matrix}\\ ] ]    due to the linearity of the stokes equations , the forces and torques exerted by the fluid on the particles ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) depend linearly on translational and rotational velocities of the particles ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "this relation defines the generalized friction matrix @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are the cartesian tensors and the superscripts @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to the translational , rotational and dipolar components , respectively .",
    "the tensor @xmath23 is the symmetric part of @xmath9 in ( [ eq : shear_matrix ] ) and @xmath24 is the vorticity of the incident flow .",
    "finally @xmath25 corresponds to the position of particle @xmath26 .",
    "the reciprocal relation giving velocities of particles moving under external forces / torques in external flow @xmath27 is determined by generalized mobility matrix @xmath28 written after @xcite @xmath29 + \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\mathbf{c}^{t}_{i }   \\\\ \\mathbf{c}^{r}_{i }   \\end{array } \\right ) : \\mathbf{e}_{\\infty } , \\label{eq : generalmobilitymatrixseparatedc}\\ ] ] where the shear disturbance tensor @xmath30 elements are defined as    [ eq : ctensor ] @xmath31    in the case of single particle the mobility matrixes reduce to @xmath32 where the friction coefficients for a spherical particle are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "finding the mobility matrix ( or the associated diffusion matrix , @xmath35 ) is the problem of a fundamental importance in constructing the numerical algorithms for tracking the motion of the particles in viscous fluid .",
    "the two main numerical methods used for this purpose are the _ stokesian dynamics _ , which corresponds to the numerical integration of  [ eq : generalmobilitymatrixseparatedc ] and the _ brownian dynamics _ ,",
    "used whenever the brownian motion of the particles can not be neglected  @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the random displacements of the particles , @xmath36 , need to be added on top of the deterministic displacements governed by eq .",
    "[ eq : generalmobilitymatrixseparatedc ] .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem implies that the covariance of @xmath37 is connected to the mobility matrix , e.g. for the translational displacements @xmath38 hence the calculation of @xmath36 requires finding a matrix @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .",
    "this is possible only when the mobility matrix is positively defined .",
    "any valid approximation scheme for the hydrodynamic interactions should then not only correctly reproduce the particle mobilities but also guarantee the positive definiteness of the mobility tensors .",
    "in principle the hydrodynamic interactions tensors can be calculated with arbitrary precision , following e.g. the multipole expansion or boundary integral method @xcite . in practice",
    ", however , the exact approach turns out to be too demanding computationally , so various approximation procedures have to be resorted to . the most commonly used is the rotne - prager - yamakwa approximation @xcite , based on the following idea : when a force ( or torque ) is applied to particle @xmath26 , that particle begins to move inducing the flow in the bulk of the fluid .",
    "the extent to which this additional flow affects translational and rotational velocities of another particle ( @xmath41 ) is then calculated using faxen s laws @xcite . in that way",
    "one neglects not only the multi - body effects ( involving three and more particles ) but also the higher order terms in two - particle interactions ( e.g. we do not consider the impact of the movement of particle @xmath41 back on particle @xmath26 ) .",
    "below , we follow this procedure to derive in a systematic way hydrodynamic tensors for both translational and rotational degrees of freedom .      the stokes flow generated by a point force in the unbounded space",
    "is given by the oseen tensor @xcite @xmath43 since @xmath44 is a green function for stokes equations , one can use it to calculate the translational @xmath45 and rotational @xmath46 flows generated by the sphere situated  at  @xmath47 , to which we apply force @xmath48 and/or torque @xmath49 : @xmath50\\cdot\\bm{\\mathcal{f}},\\qquad \\rho_j > a,\\\\ \\,\\\\",

    "<S> rotne - prager - yamakawa approximation is one of the most commonly used methods of including hydrodynamic interactions in modelling of colloidal suspensions and polymer solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the two main merits of this approximation is that it includes all long - range terms ( i.e. decaying as @xmath0 or slower in interparticle distances ) and that the diffusion matrix is positive definite , which is essential for brownian dynamics modelling . here , we extend the rotne - prager - yamakawa approach to include both translational and rotational degrees of freedom , and derive the regularizing corrections to account for overlapping particles . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we show how the rotne - prager - yamakawa approximation can be generalized for other geometries and boundary conditions . </S>"
