    "the relevance of the accretion processes in understanding the emission properties of many astrophysical sources like gamma ray bursts @xcite and active galactic nuclei @xcite , led to a significant effort over the last four decades in order to construct a standard model for the profile of an accreting disk over a compact object .",
    "starting from the original idea of shakura @xcite a wide number of results ( see for istance @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) allowed to achieve the firm understanding that , within a disk , the angular momentum transport is driven by dissipative effects ( for a detailed review see @xcite ) . since the nature of such viscosity and resistivity of the plasma can not be recovered on a microscopical level ( such systems are mainly collinsionless ) , then the origin of non - ideal features must rely on the turbulent behaviour of the plasma once linear instabilities are triggered . the most successful paradigm to explain the onset of the turbulence is the so called magneto - rotational instability , discovered by velikhov @xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite , and recently fully developed by balbus and collaborators @xcite ( for a review see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , such instability , which can be triggered by an arbitrary small magnetic field , is nonetheless suppressed when the sound speed is smaller than the alfvn velocity , i.e. when the @xmath0 parameter of the plasma is smaller than one .",
    "since this condition can take place in sufficiently cold and magnetized plasma disks , a challenging puzzle arises when dealing with the accretion mechanism in structures exhibiting such regimes .",
    "two interesting proposals for alternative scenarios were proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , b. coppi and coworkers developed over the last ten years a line of research devoted to construct a different paradigm @xcite , mainly based on the implementation on the astrophysical setting of some basic features observed in laboratory plasma , like ballooning mode instabilities @xcite .",
    "more than solving the problem of accretion for an ideal plasma disk , such efforts had the main merit to outline the existence of regimes where the disk profile can fragment into a sequence of rings .",
    "this situation takes place as soon as the lorentz force , produced by the plasma backreaction in the magnetic field of the central object , plays a significant role in the vertical confinement .",
    "this result , however , was obtained in a local description of a purely rotating disk , and disregarding any dissipative effect ( see also @xcite for the jet formation in this scheme ) . despite being rather small",
    ", such dissipation features are present in any real astrophysical system , and the possibility to reconcile the ring sequence with a realistic equilibrium configuration is the main task addressed by the present work .",
    "we consider the full mhd equilibrium including , with respect to the original model , the azimuthal momentum conservation equation and the electron force balance relation . for a purely ideal and rotating plasma ,",
    "these equations are identically satisfied , but in a real system ( here we consider non zero viscosity and resistivity coefficient , associated to a magnetic prandtl number of order unity ) they are crucial for fixing the poloidal matter fluxes and the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "we provide a solution for the global configuration system which has the merit to demonstrate that the existence of the ring sequence within the disk is compatible with non zero dissipative effects , and , over all , with the presence of a non zero radial matter flux .",
    "nonetheless , the smallness of the additional terms we include in our treatment , allows us to neglect the poloidal velocity and the toroidal magnetic field in the radial and vertical configuration , which therefore retain the same form as in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that dealing with only small corrections is a constraint imposed by the corotation theorem @xcite .",
    "in fact , as shown in the last section , up to the leading order , it is still possible to preserve the relation between the angular velocity of the disk @xmath1 and the magnetic surface function @xmath2 as far as the additional contributions due to the poloidal velocity , the toroidal magnetic field and the dissipative effects , are sufficiently small with respect to the basic model quantities as in @xcite .",
    "a significant improvement that our analysis is able to provide , is fixing the vertical dependence of the disk profile as a consequence of a compatibility equation coming out from the azimuthal and the electron force balance system .",
    "the local model we provide can be regarded as the starting point for the study of the settlement of linear instabilities in the paradigm of the crystalline structure .    as outlined in @xcite , the crystalline morphology of the magnetic field , as well as the ring sequence profile ,",
    "have a characteristic scale which turns out to be microscopical on an astrophysical setting ( indeed the typical length of the perturbations results to be of the order of some meters ) .",
    "this issue suggests that , more than for its stationary appearance , such a morphology concerns the stability structure of the disk , and only after a full scheme of perturbation analysis is developed , a precise nature of the configuration can be settled down . in this respect ,",
    "our treatment stands as the natural and realistic framework where to study the stability of the plasma disk .",
    "we will now set up the basic 2d mhd configuration equations for an axially - symmetric disk around a compact ( few solar masses ) and strongly magnetized ( a dipole - like field of about @xmath3 gauss ) object , i.e. a typical pulsar source .",
    "in such a system , we neglect the self - gravity of the disk , so that the gravitational potential @xmath4 , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath5 , has the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of the central body , and @xmath8 the gravitational constant .",
    "it is worth noting that the axial symmetry prevents any dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath9 of all the quantities involved in the problem .",
    "the continuity equation associated to the mass conservation , i.e. @xmath10 admits the following explicit solution @xmath11 here @xmath12 denotes the mass density , @xmath13 the velocity field of the disk , and @xmath14 is a function which is odd with respect to the @xmath15 variable , in order to deal with a non - zero accretion rate @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath17 is the half - depth of the disk , @xmath16 results to be given by @xcite @xmath18 the dynamics of such a stationary , viscoresistive system is then described by the following equation @xcite @xmath19\\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath20 being the viscosity and @xmath21 the unit tensor ; the magnetic field @xmath22 , because of the axial symmetry , can be expressed through the magnetic flux function @xmath23 in the general form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a generic function of @xmath2 characterizing the toroidal component of the field .",
    "the similarity of the magnetic field and matter flux structure , is due to their common divergence - less nature .",
    "a further assumption in our derivation is that the angular frequency of the disk @xmath1 has to be a function of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath26 this result has been firstly demonstrated by ferraro in @xcite under the hypotheses of an ideal , non resistive , axisymmetric rotating plasma . it can be shown ( see the detailed proof discussed in the last section ) that this result holds even in the presence of small resistivity and viscosity .      in the present analysis , we are interested in the behavior of the configuration around a fixed , fiducial value @xmath27 of the radial variable @xmath28 . in order to investigate the effects induced on the disk profile by the electromagnetic reaction of the plasma , we split the mass density and the pressure contributions in the zeroth ( barred ) and the first ( hatted ) orders components , i.e. @xmath29 respectively . the same way , we express the magnetic surface function as the sum of a term @xmath30 , describing the field of the star , plus a correction @xmath31 @xmath32 the quantities @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 describe the change induced by the currents which rise within the disk . in general , these corrections are small in amplitude but with a very short scale of variation . having this scenario in mind",
    ", we address the so - called  drift ordering  for the behavior of the gradient amplitude , i.e. the first order gradients of the perturbations are of zeroth - order , while the second order ones dominate .",
    "accordingly , the profile of the toroidal currents rising in the disk , has the form @xmath36 on the other hand , the azimuthal component of the lorentz force is related to the existence of the function @xmath37 and results to be equal to @xmath38    as a consequence of the corotation theorem , in the present split scheme , we can decompose @xmath1 in the sum of the keplerian term @xmath39 and a constant @xmath40 , respectively given by @xmath41 @xmath42 this form for @xmath1 holds locally , as far as @xmath43 remains a sufficiently small quantity , so that the dominant deviation from the keplerian contribution is due to @xmath31 only .      as developed in @xcite , we can distinguish the fluid components from the electromagnetic back - reaction .",
    "the vertical component of eq.([navstokes ] ) implies that , at the zeroth order , the background profile is determined by the pure thermostatic equilibrium standing in the disk when the vertical gravity ( i.e. the keplerian rotation ) is sufficiently high to provide a confined thin configuration @xmath44 here we have assumed that the background obeys an isothermal relation , and that the temperature @xmath45 may be then represented as @xmath46 @xmath47 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath48 the ion mass . on the other hand , at the first order , the vertical equilibrium is described by the following equation @xmath49      the radial component of eq.([navstokes ] ) fixes the equilibrium features of the rotating layers of the disk , and can be decomposed into the dominant character of the keplerian angular velocity , plus an equation describing the behavior of the deviation , i.e. @xmath50 + \\frac{1}{4\\pi r_0 ^ 2}\\partial_r\\psi _ 1 \\partial^2_z\\psi_1\\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] here we neglected the presence of the poloidal currents , associated with the azimuthal component of the magnetic field , as soon as their contribution results to be of higher order .      by inserting eq.([splitomega ] ) into the @xmath9-component of eq.([navstokes ] ) , we easily obtain the relation governing the azimuthal equilibrium ; more precisely we get @xmath51 by virtue of the magnetic field form ( [ vectorb ] ) , of the lorentz force ( [ fphi ] ) , the azimuthal equation stands at @xmath27 as @xmath52 \\ , , \\label{exazeqlo } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and we neglected the @xmath15-derivatives of the viscosity coefficient in view of the hierarchy of the equations @xcite .",
    "this relation accounts for the angular momentum transport across the disk , by relying on the presence of a viscous feature of the differential rotation .",
    "furthermore , this equation establishes a link between the radial and vertical velocity fields with the poloidal currents present in the configuration .",
    "a complete analysis of the dynamics is , however , still not possible .",
    "the system given by eqs.([verticalequilibrium ] ) , ( [ radialequilibrium ] ) and ( [ exazeqlo ] ) is not closed , and we have to impose some other condition in order to describe the poloidal component of the magnetic field @xmath54 and the function @xmath55 .",
    "this task will be accomplished in the next section when the balance of the forces acting on the electrons will be discussed .",
    "in the presence of a non - zero resistivity coefficient @xmath56 , the equation accounting for the electron force balance reads as @xmath57 since the contribution of the resistive term is expected to be relatively small , it turns out as appreciable only in the azimuthal component of the equation above .",
    "thus , the balance of the lorentz force has dominant radial and vertical components , providing the electric field in the form predicted by the corotation theorem , i.e. @xmath58 since the axial symmetry requires @xmath59 , the @xmath9-component of the equation above takes the form @xmath60 and , taking into account eq.([jphi ] ) , it reduces to @xmath61 this relation , together with the azimuthal equilibrium equation ( [ exazeqlo ] ) , provides a system for the two unknowns @xmath55 and @xmath54 , when @xmath31 and @xmath12 are given by the vertical ( [ verticalequilibrium ] ) and radial ( [ radialequilibrium ] ) equilibria .",
    "more precisely , substituting eq.([efbloc ] ) in eq.([exazeqlo ] ) , we get @xmath62 \\ , . \\label{exazeqlocomb } \\end{split}\\ ] ]",
    "in order to analyze the dynamics , we need to state some relation between the viscosity @xmath20 and the resistivity @xmath56 of the plasma . as already done in @xcite , we assume that the magnetic prandtl number of the plasma is of order one .",
    "this in turns implies that we can take the following relation @xmath63    now , inserting eq.([fundcond ] ) into eq.([exazeqlocomb ] ) , we can get a direct relation between the radial velocity @xmath64 , that accounts for the accretion on the central object , and the lorentz force @xmath65 ; more precisely , we get @xmath66 substituting @xmath64 by this equation into the electron force balance ( [ efbloc ] ) , we get the following expression for @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{efblocn}\\ ] ] in terms of the function @xmath55 , the expressions above for @xmath64 ( [ exazeqlocombn ] ) and @xmath67 ( [ efblocn ] ) stands as @xmath69   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solution of the first equation can be taken as @xmath70 which , substituted in the second , yields an integro - differential relation for @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 once the behavior of @xmath35 is provided , from the equation above we can determine the form of @xmath73 and eventually calculate the @xmath9-component @xmath74 of the magnetic field .",
    "let us define the dimensionless functions @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , in place of @xmath35 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath78 where    @xmath79    and @xmath80 .",
    "we introduced the fundamental wavenumber @xmath81 that quantifies the typical length scale of the perturbation along the radial directions .",
    "finally , we rescale the radial variable @xmath82 , and the vertical one @xmath83 assuming the fundamental length in the vertical direction to be @xmath84 .    by these definitions ,",
    "the vertical ( [ verticalequilibrium ] ) and the radial equilibria ( [ radialequilibrium ] ) can be restated as    [ sistema1 ] @xmath85 @xmath86    where @xmath87 the two equations above provide a coupled system for @xmath77 and @xmath75 once the quantities @xmath88 and @xmath76 are assigned ; hence we are able to determine the disk configuration induced by the toroidal currents .",
    "finally , eq.([fphicomp ] ) takes the form @xmath89 @xmath90 being a dimensionless function .",
    "here we will derive a solution to the system ( [ sistema1 ] ) in the case @xmath91 , showing how the formation of the crystalline structure for the magnetic field and the decomposition of the disk in a ring sequence can happen also in different regimes from those addressed in @xcite .",
