    "there has been an explosion of theoretical and experimental research in the search for three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators ( tis ) , which are a new quantum state of matter with promising applications in spintronics and multifunctional topological - based devices and interfaces .",
    "tis are characterized by gapped bulk states , similar to a normal ( trivial ) insulators , with robust gapless _",
    "topologically protected _ metallic surface states resulting from the strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",
    "this in turn leads to an odd number of dirac - cone - like dispersions crossing the fermi level at the surface and to a non - trivial @xmath2 topological invariant .",
    "the surface states exhibit an unconventional spin texture with the spin direction locked to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron momentum .",
    "current ongoing research efforts focus primarily on the prototypical single dirac - cone family of bi@xmath3te@xmath4 , bi@xmath3se@xmath4 , and sb@xmath3te@xmath4 3d tis , where angle - resolved- photoemission experiments have shown the chiral spin texture of the surface states@xcite .",
    "although the band inversion near the time - reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) points ( @xmath5 mod @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is a reciprocal lattice vector ) , is a strong indication that a system is ti , it is not definitive because the topological invariant is a global property of the entire occupied brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "thus , in order to confirm conclusively whether a 3d system is topologically trivial or non - trivial it is essential to compute the @xmath2 invariant . for band insulators with crystal inversion symmetry ,",
    "the topological invariant number can be easily computed as the product of half of the parity ( kramers pairs have identical parities ) numbers for all the occupied states at the trim points . for the general case of non - centrosymmetric systems ( such as zinc - blende structures )",
    "the topological invariant can be determined either by integrating both the berry s connection and curvature over half of the bz@xcite or by calculating the evolution of the wannier function center during a  time - reversal pumping \" process@xcite .",
    "these two equivalent approaches are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "the mercury chalcogenides hgse and hgte in the zinc - blende ( zb ) structure belong to a group of unique materials exhibiting the so - called inverted band structure . in this band structure ,",
    "the energy of the anion @xmath7-derived @xmath8 state , which is the conduction - band minimum ( cbm ) at @xmath1 for most zb semiconductors , is below the anion @xmath9-like valence - band maximum ( vbm ) with @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "however , the experimental results for the electronic structure of hgse are controversial .",
    "early photoelectron spectroscopic experiments@xcite on n - type hgse indicated that this material should have a gap with a positive value for @xmath11 = 0.42 ev . on the other hand",
    ", photoemission experiments@xcite of the non - polar hgse ( 110 ) surface ( to minimize the effects of surface charges ) could not unequivocally determine the sign of @xmath12 due to lack of resolution of the sequence of the @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath10 bands .",
    "currently , the consensus of a large amount of experimental results@xcite for hgse seems to give the sequence of the energy bands in ascending order is @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath10 , with @xmath14 -0.2 ev and the spin - orbit splitting , @xmath15 0.4 ev . _ ab initio _ calculations based on the gw ( g is the green s function and w is the screened coulomb interaction ) scheme find@xcite @xmath14 -0.32 to -0.58 ev and @xmath16 0.27 to 0.32 ev , in agreement with experiment .    in contrast , in hgte the sequence of the energy bands is @xmath13 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10@xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent transport experiments@xcite on a 70-nm - thick hgte film , strained by epitaxial growth on a cdte substrate , show that the strain induces a band gap in the otherwise semi metallic hgte , rendering it a 3d ti .",
    "similar strain appears when thin hgse films are epitaxially grown on cdte or cdse substrates .",
    "the objective of this work is to investigate the effects of uniaxial strain on the topological phase of hgse employing _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the methodology used to calculate topological invariants and the band structures . in section iii",
    "we analyze the evolution of the band structure and the topological invariant number under two different type of uniaxial strain along the [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] directions , respectively . in order to corroborate the topological insulator nature we also present results for the electronic structure of the non - polar ( 110 ) hgse surface and the spin polarization of the surface states .",
    "finally , conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "for 2d systems , there are two commonly employed numerical approaches to determine whether a non - centrosymmetric insulator is a ti .    1 .    use the periodic part of the bloch functions , @xmath17 , to calculate the berry connection , @xmath18 , involving the sum over the occupied bands.@xcite for a 2d system , both the berry connection and the berry curvature , @xmath19 , can then be used to directly compute the topological invariant , @xmath20 , involving the integration over half of the bz , denoted by @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 \\text{mod 2}.\\ ] ] 2 .",
    "employ a recently proposed equivalent method for the @xmath2 topological invariant based on the u(2n ) non - abelian berry connection@xcite .",
    "this approach allows the identification of the topological nature of a general band insulator without any of the gauge - fixing problems that plague the concrete , previous implementation of invariants .",
    "the main idea of the method is to calculate the evolution of the wannier function center ( wfc ) directly during a  time - reversal pumping \" process , which is a @xmath2 analog to the charge polarization proposed by fu and kane .",
    "the evolution of the wfc along @xmath23 corresponds to the phase factor , @xmath24 , of the eigenvalues of the position operator , @xmath25 , projected into the occupied subspace .",
    "each state of the @xmath26th occupied band is indexed by three quantum numbers @xmath27 .",
    "this allows to define a square matrix @xmath28 containing the overlap integrals , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the discrete spacing of @xmath31 points .",
    "one can in turn calculate the complex unitary square matrix + @xmath32 , + which has the complex eigenvalues @xmath33 .",
    "the topological invariant @xmath20 is then calculated by the even or odd number of crossings of any arbitrary horizontal ( @xmath24=const . )",
    "reference line with the evolution of the @xmath34 s , mod 2 .    for a 3d bulk system , it is necessary to calculate two different invariants , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for the two different bz planes , @xmath37 = 0 and @xmath37 = @xmath38 , containing eight trim points .",
    "the computation for each plane is analogous to the 2d case which has four trim points .",

    "the non - polar ( 110 ) surface is modeled by a periodic slab consisting of 21 atomic layers with a 12  - thick vacuum region separating the periodic slabs .",
    "an accurate description of the electronic structure is a prerequisite in the search and discovery efforts for next - generation tis .",
    "it is known that density functional theory studies@xcite of tis based on local or semi - local exchange - correlation functionals can incorrectly predict a material to be a ti when in reality it is not @xcite , to the detriment of experiment - theory interplay .",
    "this is usually due to the fact that such a local or semi - local treatment systematically underestimates the band gap and can lead to an incorrect ordering of the frontier bands at the trim points , which is the determining factor in the prediction of the topological phase .",
    "furthermore , it can also give rise to wrong band topologies and effective masses@xcite .",

    "the fact that both the pbe and the lda@xcite exchange correlation functionals for hgse yield the correct frontier band ordering ( @xmath13 , @xmath10 ) allows for a reliable determination of the topological invariant@xcite .",

    "the large value of the energy gap in thin slabs is due to the interactions between the states localized at the opposite surfaces . as the number of layers increases , the size of the gap decreases converging to @xmath95 1 mev at the critical thickness of about 7 nm ( @xmath102 16 ) .",
