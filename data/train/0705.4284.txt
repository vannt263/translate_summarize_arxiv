    "diffuse synchrotron radio emission is often found in the intracluster medium ( icm ) of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these radio sources in clusters are often classified as either peripheral cluster radio relic sources or central cluster radio halo sources . since",
    "most of the relics and halos are found in merging clusters , the particles responsible for the emission are thought to be accelerated at shocks or turbulence excited by cluster mergers @xcite .    however , there are exceptional diffuse radio sources .",
    "they are called ` minihalos ' and are located in the central regions of non - merging clusters or ` cooling core ' clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the diffuse synchrotron emission from radio minihalos is due to a relic population of relativistic electrons reaccelerated by mhd turbulence via second - order fermi acceleration , and that the energy is supplied by cooling flows .",
    "alternatively , @xcite discussed that the electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission from minihalos are of secondary origin and thus are injected during proton - proton collision in the icm .",
    "however , @xcite did not discuss the generation of the turbulence , and @xcite did not investigate the mechanism of proton acceleration .",
    "recent x - ray observations have shown that agns at the centers of galaxy clusters sometimes exhibit intensive outbursts with a mechanical power of @xmath2  erg .",
    "the examples are ms  0735.6 + 7421 @xcite , hercules  a @xcite , and hydra - a @xcite .",
    "such an intensive outburst should excite a shock in the icm .",
    "in fact , weak shocks have been found in those clusters . in the early stage of the evolution of the shock",
    ", the mach number is expected to be large .",
    "therefore , particles would be accelerated at the shock as in the case of a supernova remnant .    in this letter",
    ", we consider particle acceleration at the shock generated by an intensive outburst of the agn at the cluster center .",
    "we study nonthermal emission from the accelerated particles .",
    "in particular , we focus on nonthermal radio emission of secondary origin .",
    "recently , @xcite estimated gamma - ray emission associated with agn outbursts , assuming that the hot cavity behind a shock is entirely filled with high - energy protons .",
    "this assumption may be too simple , and they did not discuss the acceleration and energy spectrum of protons .",
    "however , motivated by this study , we also estimate the gamma - ray emission using our model .",
    "we take the perseus cluster as a model cluster , because this cluster has a well - studied minihalo .",
    "we assume that the duration of an agn outburst is @xmath3  yr .",
    "since we are interested in the evolution of a shock for @xmath4  yr , where @xmath5 corresponds to the ignition of the outburst , the evolution can be approximated by that of an instant explosion with an energy of @xmath6 at @xmath5 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the cluster is spherically symmetric and the density profile of the icm has a form of a power - law : @xmath7 we take @xmath8 , @xmath9  kpc , and @xmath10 , based on the density profile of the perseus cluster for @xmath11  kpc ( fig .  8 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we take that region because our model is correct for @xmath12  yr , and the radius of the shock at @xmath13  yr is @xmath14  kpc for parameters we adopt in  [ sec : results ] .    using a shell approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the radius of the shock can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16^{1/(5-\\omega)}\\:,\\ ] ] and @xmath17 is the adiabatic index . the mach number of the shock gradually decreases .",
    "the shock stops expanding when its mach number approaches to one . at this point ,",
    "the cavity filled with hot gas inside the shock becomes in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding icm . since we stop calculation before the radiative cooling of the shock becomes effective ( @xmath18  gyr ) , we do not need to consider the radiative cooling .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that particles are accelerated at the shock via diffusive shock acceleration ( i.e. , first - order fermi acceleration ) and that their energy spectra are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the maximum energy of the protons or electrons .",
    "the index is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the compression ratio of the shock @xcite .",
    "we estimate the maximum energies of the protons and electrons using the relations of @xmath23 respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the acceleration time , the lifetime of high - energy protons through pion production , the age of the shock wave , and the synchrotron cooling time , respectively .    assuming the standard manner for the diffusion coefficient , the acceleration time is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the speed of light , @xmath30 is the electron charge , and @xmath31 is the shock velocity @xcite .",
    "the correction factor @xmath32 depends on the mean free path of particles and the angle between the shock and the magnetic field .",
    "since @xmath33 in the bohm - limit case , we assume that @xmath34 from now on . the downstream magnetic field is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the magnetic field strength of the unperturbed icm .",
    "we estimate @xmath25 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number density of the icm .",
    "since the shock is in pressure equilibrium in @xmath39  yr ( see  [ sec : results ] ) and @xmath40 , the cooling is not effective .",
    "thus , the maximum energy of protons is determined by the age of the shock . on the other hand ,",
    "the synchrotron cooling time for electrons is given by @xmath41 and is shorter than the age of the shock .",
    "thus , using relations  ( [ eq : rel ] ) , we obtain @xmath42",
    "@xmath43    we assume that the minimum electron and proton energies are their rest masses . for given proton and electron spectra ,",
    "we calculate radiation from them .",
    "we consider the synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton emissions from primary electrons that are directly accelerated at the shock , the @xmath44-decay gamma - ray through proton - proton collisions , and the synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton emissions from secondary electrons created through the decay of charged pions that are also generated through proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "the density of target protons for the proton - proton interaction is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the proton mass .",
    "we assume that the spectrum from secondary electrons is stationary if the lifetime of the electrons is smaller than the age of the system .",
    "on the other hand , if the lifetime is larger than the system age , we calculate the evolution according to  3 of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in our model , the evolution of a shock is determined by @xmath47 and @xmath6 ( equation  [ [ eq : rs ] ] ) .",
    "the mach number also depends on the icm temperature , @xmath48 .",
    "the energy spectrum of particles depends on the evolution of the shock and the magnetic field , @xmath36 .",
    "the luminosity of nonthermal emission from the shock depends on the total energy of high - energy ( @xmath49 ) protons inside the shock , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "we fix @xmath52 , @xmath48 , and @xmath53 from observations . on the other hand , we regard @xmath6 and @xmath54 as fitting parameters , because there are no observational data for them .",
    "we assume that @xmath55  kev , which is the temperature of the central region of the perseus cluster @xcite , although the temperature before the outburst might have been somewhat lower . as far as we know",
    ", there are no observations of magnetic fields in the perseus cluster at @xmath56  kpc . on the other hand",
    ", the observations of faraday rotation showed that the typical magnetic field strength in clusters for @xmath57  kpc is 5@xmath58 g @xcite .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath59/\\rho_{\\rm icm}[150 \\:\\rm kpc])^{2/3}$ ] assuming that the magnetic field is adiabatically compressed .",
    "we note that the spectra of particles ( equations  [ [ eq : pmax ] ] and  [ [ eq : emax ] ] ) and synchrotron emission from high - energy electrons depend on @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the results shown below is fairly sensitive to the assumption on @xmath36 .    in the following",
    ", the energy of an agn explosion is @xmath60 , which is three times larger than the one observed for ms  0735.6 + 7421 @xcite .",
    "we use this value to match @xmath61 with the size of the radio minihalo in the perseus cluster .",
    "we take the acceleration efficiency of @xmath62 to match radio observations ( see below ) .",
    "the ratio of high - energy electrons to high - energy protons is taken to be @xmath63 as a fiducial value . in the self - similar solution of the shock",
    "we adopt , the kinetic and thermal energies are respectively constant .",
    "therefore , we assume that the total energy of the high - energy protons is also constant .",
    "the typical mach number of the shock in our calculations is @xmath64 ( for @xmath65  yr ) .",
    "performing simulations taking account of the back - reaction of accelerated particles on hydrodynamics , @xcite estimated that the cosmic - ray acceleration efficiency is @xmath66 for that mach number .",
    "since they defined cosmic - ray as particles with energies larger than those of thermal particles ( or the injection energy for acceleration ) , the fraction of protons having energies of @xmath49 must be smaller than 0.2 .",
    "although it is not certain whether equation  ( [ eq : ne ] ) can be extrapolated down to the injection energy , the adopted value of @xmath62 is consistent with that of @xcite because it is smaller than 0.2 .",
    "[ fig:0.02 ] shows the spectrum of nonthermal emission from accelerated particles at @xmath67  yr .",
    "the distance to the model cluster is 78.4  mpc ( the distance to the perseus cluster , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 ) .",
    "synchrotron emission from primary electrons is dominant upto @xmath70  kev .",
    "the maximum energies for protons and electrons are @xmath71  ev and @xmath72  ev , respectively . the radius of the shock at this time is @xmath73  kpc , the shock velocity is @xmath74 , and the mach number is 2.7 .",
    "[ fig:0.04 ] shows the spectrum at @xmath75  yr . at this time , @xmath76  ev , @xmath77  ev , and @xmath78  kpc , which is close to the size of the minihalo in the perseus cluster .",
    "the shock velocity is @xmath79 and the mach number is 2.0 . in figs .",
    "[ fig:0.02 ] and [ fig:0.04 ] , we plot the observed radio fluxes of the minihalo in the perseus cluster @xcite . as can be seen , the predicted radio synchrotron emission ( long - dashed line ) is too bright to be consistent with the observations . if we take smaller @xmath6 , the radio luminosity becomes smaller",
    ". however , the size of the minihalo is too small to be consistent with the observed one . moreover , if we consider a much smaller electron - proton ratio ( e.g. @xmath80 ) , the radio spectral index is inconsistent with the observations .",
    "one possibility is that the age is much larger than @xmath81  yr and is @xmath82  yr .",
    "at that time , the shock is not prominent because it is almost in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding icm .",
    "in fact , for the perseus cluster , a shock of @xmath83200  kpc has not been reported .",
    "as the shock expands , its mach number decreases from 2.7 ( at @xmath67  yr ) to 2.0 ( at @xmath84  yr ) .",
    "accordingly , the compression ratio ( @xmath22 ) decreases , which affects the energy spectrum of particles and the emission from them ( eq .  [ [ eq : ne ] ] ) .",
    "@xcite indicated that particles are no longer accelerated if the mach number is @xmath85 .",
    "thus , for @xmath86  yr , particle acceleration at the shock is not effective .    at @xmath87  yr",
    ", the emission from primary electrons may have died out , because electrons with a lorentz factor of @xmath88 , which are responsible for the radio emission , lose their energy through synchrotron emission and inverse compton emission on a time - scale of @xmath89 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the lifetime of protons is much larger than @xmath90  yr ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : tpp ] ] ) , and the diffusion time of protons having the maximum energy of @xmath91  ev from the central region of the cluster ( @xmath92  kpc ) is @xmath93  yr @xcite . since particles are no longer accelerated at @xmath86  yr , the overall spectrum originated from proton - proton collisions stays almost intact for @xmath94  yr . in the radio band , only synchrotron emission from secondary electrons ( dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:0.04 ] ) will be observed at @xmath87  yr . in this case , the predicted spectrum ( thick - solid line in fig .  [ fig:0.04 ] ) well fits the radio observations .",
    "since the secondary radio emission is produced by protons having energies of @xmath70  gev and since the diffusion time of these protons is @xmath95  gyr , the radio emission could persist that time .",
    "we emphasize that the assumption on the electron - proton ratio ( @xmath96 ) is not required to estimate the emission originated from proton collisions .",
    "although our model is basically an one - zone model and can not quantitatively predict the spatial change of the spectrum , we can qualitatively predict that . compared with the one at @xmath67  yr ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0.02 ] ) , the spectrum of synchrotron emission from secondary electrons at @xmath75  yr is softer in the radio band ( @xmath971  ghz ; fig .",
    "[ fig:0.04 ] ) . the spectral index in the band of 327609  mhz changes from 1.64 ( @xmath67  yr , @xmath73  kpc ) to 1.88 ( @xmath75  yr , @xmath98  kpc ) .",
    "since some of the protons accelerated at an earlier time should remain in the inner region of a cluster , the spectrum should be less steep in the inner region .",
    "this tendency is consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned above , the radio emission from secondary electrons could persist for a long time ( @xmath95  gyr ) .",
    "our model will be tested for the frequency ( or the event rate ) of large outbursts .",
    "@xcite indicated that large outbursts are likely occurring @xmath99% of the time in a significant proportion of all cooling core clusters .",
    "thus , our model would suggest that a large fraction of clusters should have minihalos .",
    "this is inconsistent with the rareness of minihalos .",
    "however , the outbursts observed so far are of energies of @xmath100 @xcite , which is smaller than our finding ( @xmath101  erg ) .",
    "thus , the rareness may indicate that strong agn outbursts with energies of @xmath102 are rare phenomena or minor cluster mergers often perturb cluster cores .",
    "another possibility is that particle acceleration at low - mach number shocks occurs only in some specific igm environments depending on the density of the surrounding matter , magnetic field configurations , and so on . in the future ,",
    "statistical studies about agn outbursts of @xmath103 are highly desired .",
    "the morphology of the radio surface brightness would also be important to check the validity of the model .",
    "if the particle acceleration is triggered by the expanding shock , one would expect a torus - like shape instead of the spherical shape observed for minihalos @xcite .",
    "however , for clusters observed so far , the central region behind the shock is not empty ; the icm is still filling ( e.g. fig .  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "thermal protons there may work as target protons for the proton - proton interaction and thus the radio emission may not be a torus - like shape .",
    "a spatially resolved model must be constructed to address this issue .    in figs .",
    "[ fig:0.02 ] and [ fig:0.04 ] , we also plot the observational upper limits of gamma - ray emission from the perseus cluster @xcite . at @xmath67",
    "yr , the gamma - ray emission is brighter than the observations . at @xmath87  yr",
    ", there is no longer emission from primary electrons , and only gamma - ray emission of proton origin ( thick - solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig:0.04 ] ) will be observed in the gamma - ray band . the predicted gamma - ray flux at @xmath104  ev is @xmath105 , which could be detected with _ glast _   with a sensitivity of @xmath106 .",
    "the gamma - ray emission would persist for @xmath107 .",
    "if the gamma - ray is detected , it directly indicates that protons as well as electrons are accelerated in clusters .",
    "moreover , the luminosity reflects the total energy of the protons .    on the other hand , it would be difficult to detect the emission with imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes .",
    "for example , _",
    "_ has a sensitivity of @xmath108 at @xmath109  ev ) .",
    "the predicted flux is smaller than the detection limit ( fig .",
