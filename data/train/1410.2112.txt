    "recent exoplanet surveys have discovered the first planets with sizes between 2 earth radii ( r@xmath5 ) and 3.5@xmath6 , the size of neptune .",
    "these planets , known as mini - neptunes , revolve around the m stars gj 436b @xcite , gj 1214b @xcite , kepler 26b and kepler 32d @xcite and gj 3470b @xcite .",
    "since mini - neptunes around m stars are expected to be abundant @xcite and m stars are the most common stars in the solar neighborhood @xcite , we expect that many more mini - neptunes will be discovered in the near future .",
    "since m stars have low effective temperatures , the bulk of their flux is emitted in the optical and near ir .",
    "inactive m stars have very low - photospheric  uv - continuum emission when compared to solar - type stars . direct observations of active m dwarfs show a high flux in the far - uv ( fuv 9121700   ) @xcite , and the percentage of total uv flux from the star in the h i lyman @xmath0 line ( ly@xmath0 ) is between 37 and 75 per  cent compared to 0.04 per  cent for the sun @xcite .",
    "while most of the stellar ly@xmath0 radiation is scattered or absorbed in the interstellar medium , ly@xmath0 is the brightest fuv emission line in the stellar spectrum seen by an exoplanet @xcite which makes this emission line critical for atmospheric photochemistry .",
    "while the effect of extreme - uv irradiation ( euv 200911   ) was studied for earth - like @xcite and giant planets @xcite and the consequence of high fuv m star irradiation was explored for habitable planets atmospheres @xcite , the effect of fuv irradiation and especially ly@xmath0 flux on hot mini - neptune atmospheres has not yet been evaluated .",
    "solar ly@xmath0 radiation is known to have a strong impact on the photochemistry of the planets in our solar system , and the effects of stellar ly@xmath0 radiation on the photochemistry of hot extrasolar planets are expected to be important , but such effects have not yet been quantified . in particular , the effect of lyman-@xmath0 radiation on the thermal profile in mini - neptune atmospheres is only beginning to be studied @xcite",
    ".    we have performed 1d simulations of hot mini - neptune atmospheres under different irradiation conditions to make a deeper exploration of the effects of ly@xmath0 flux on the photochemistry .",
    "we focus here on the mini - neptune gj 436b as an example , using recent uv observations including the reconstructed ly@xmath0 flux @xcite .",
    "gj 436 is an m3 dwarf ( t@xmath7  k ) with a radius @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "its coronal flux ( log@xmath9 ) is smaller than the mean for m dwarfs ( log@xmath10 ) , indicating a low activity corona for gj 436 @xcite . the first reconstructed ly@xmath0 emission line profile performed for gj 436",
    "was based on ( hst / stis ) observations @xcite .",

    "one thousand times the ly@xmath0 flux of gj 436 corresponds to a very active m dwarf star , and 0.001 x ly@xmath0 corresponds to very strong absorption of that radiation in the planet s extended upper atmosphere .",

    "[ cross - section ] ) .",
    "the 1d atmospheric chemistry model ( see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed explanation ) considers equilibrium chemistry for higher temperatures and pressures and chemical disequilibrium in the upper atmosphere where the densities are low , and these processes have shorter timescales .",
    "the code includes disequilibrium processes ( molecular diffusion , vertical mixing and photochemistry ) and focuses on the following species in 179 reactions : o , o(1d ) , o@xmath1 , h@xmath1o , h , oh , co@xmath1 , co , hco , h@xmath1co , ch@xmath2 , ch@xmath20 , ch@xmath20o , ch@xmath20oh , ch , ch@xmath1 , h@xmath1coh , c and h@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "other important species like hcn and c@xmath1h@xmath1 are beyond the scope of this work and will be included in a future study .",
    "to characterize vertical - mixing processes in the atmosphere , we use a constant - eddy diffusion coefficient .",
    "although this coefficient is difficult to constrain , results derived from comparisons between 1d and 3d models for hd 209458b show that the eddy - diffusion coefficient has values between @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xmath23  s@xmath13 @xcite . following these results ,",
    "we adopt an intermediate value of @xmath24  @xmath23  s@xmath13 in our calculations .",
    "note that this value is not known for most hot extrasolar planets , and different values lead to differences in the upper atmosphere - mixing ratios @xcite .",
    "an exploration of extreme cases was performed by @xcite who showed that dissociation becomes less efficient as vertical mixing becomes stronger in the atmosphere which affects the atmospheric abundances and the effect of ly@xmath0 radiation in the atmosphere .",
    "we obtained the temperature and pressure profiles from a radiative atmosphere model developed by for highly irradiated exoplanets by @xcite who found global mean thermal profiles comparable to detailed - atmospheric model calculations .",
    "the temperature structure of the exoplanet atmosphere as a function of the mean optical depth for thermal radiation ( @xmath25 ) is given by equation ( [ t ] ) @xcite :    @xmath26    @xmath27    we use @xmath28 which provides a good match to the thermal structures retrieved from observations of gj 436b @xcite and gcms models @xcite .",
    "the planet s internal temperature ( t@xmath29 ) is usually adopted as 50  k for old mini - neptunes [ e.g. @xcite ] , but gj 436b has a high eccentricity [ e=0.146 @xcite ] which implies a potentially tidally heated exoplanet @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt t@xmath30  k [ following @xcite ] .",
    "different values of t@xmath31 might change the thermal profile deep in the atmosphere @xcite .",

    "photodissociation of atmospheric molecules occurs mostly in the upper atmosphere .",
    "this process is typically a one - way reaction which means that the probability of recombination and subsequent photon emission is negligible , thereby maintaining chemical disequilibrium in this region of the atmosphere .",
    "all major species in mini - neptune atmospheres considered in our model have a dissociation energy corresponding to wavelengths shorter than 2800  @xmath11 h@xmath1o ( dissociation energy 5.17  ev , equivalent to 2398   ) , co@xmath1 ( 5.52  ev or 2247   ) , ch@xmath2 ( 4.55  ev or 2722   ) , h@xmath1 ( 4.52  ev or 2743   ) and co ( 11.14  ev or 1113   ) .",

    "thus h@xmath1 shields other molecules from very shortwave radiation .",

    "these two molecules absorb most of the ly@xmath0 radiation , thereby shielding ch@xmath2 . the smaller effect on h@xmath1o",
    "also leads to smaller changes in the abundance of those other molecules for which mixing ratios in the upper atmosphere strongly depend on h@xmath1o photolysis .",
    "our models show that ly@xmath0 radiation from the host star affects mini - neptune atmospheres significantly at low pressures and can not be ignored in atmospheric modeling .",
    "ly@xmath0 radiation affects the photochemistry of important gases in the upper atmosphere and , therefore , also the resulting observable spectral features of mini - neptunes . observations of the uv flux from a wide range of stars as well as studies of the absorption of this radiation in the exoplanet thermospheres are essential for realistic interpretations of planetary spectra .",
