    "<S> technicalities are required even to define the corresponding concept of determinantal point process for @xmath0 being euclidean space or a more general space . </S>",

    "<S> space limitations prevent mention of most of what is known in determinantal probability theory , which pertains largely to the analysis of specific examples . </S>",
