    "cosy is a synchrotron with electron cooling at injection energy and stochastic cooling at higher energies .",
    "it provides beam of unpolarised as well as polarised beams of protons and deuteron up to @xmath0 mev / c momentum .",
    "cosy can be used as a storage ring to supply internal experiments with beam .",
    "the beam can also be stochastically extracted within time bins ranging from 10 s to several minutes to external experiments .",
    "the emittance of the extracted cooled beam is only @xmath1 mm mrad .",
    "this allows excellent close to target tracking .",
    "hence a large fraction of the experimental programme is devoted to meson production close to threshold .    here",
    "we will concentrate on hadron physics thus leaving out detectors built for different purposes .",
    "these are cosy-11 , anke and edda internally and tof and big karl externally .",
    "the physics at edda will be presented in the contribution by hinterberger @xcite and is therefore neglected here .",
    "cosy-11 and anke are magnetic detectors .",
    "the former @xcite employs an accelerator dipole magnet while the latter @xcite is a chicane consisting of three dipoles with the middle one as analysing magnet .",
    "tof @xcite is a a huge vacuum vessel with several layers if scintillators .",
    "time of flight is measured between start detectors in the target area and the scintillators .",
    "the target area detectors are especially suited for the identification of delayed decays and tof is thus a geometry detector .",
    "big karl @xcite is a focussing magnetic spectrograph of the 3q2d - type .",
    "particle tracks are measured in the focal plane area with packs od mwdc s followed by scintillator hodoscopes allowing for a time of flight path of 3.5 m. additional detectors exist .",
    "momo @xcite measured the emission vertex of charged particles . the germanium wall @xcite is a stack of four annular germanium diodes being position sensitive",
    ". it acts as a recoil spectrometer .",
    "one strong item in cosy physics is the study of strangeness production in various processes in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions .",
    "here we have to concentrate on a few of these reactions .",
    "the @xmath5 reactions , associated strangeness production were measured by cosy-11 @xcite and tof @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ associated ] the ratio @xmath6 is shown as function of the excess energy .",
    "the ratio rises strongly to threshold .",
    "this unexpected behaviour is studied within several models , including pion and kaon exchange added coherently with destructive interference @xcite or incoherently  @xcite , the excitation of nucleon resonances  @xcite ( labeled effective lagrangian ) , resonaces with heavy meson exchange ( @xmath7 @xcite and heavy meson exchange ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 )  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding curves are also shown in the figure .",
    "all models show a decrease of the ratio with increasing excitation energy but none of them accounts for all data .",
    "the associated strangeness production is also a useful tool to study the nucleon ",
    "hyperon interaction via fsi . at present a high resolution study of this interaction runs at big karl .",
    "the measurement of dalitz diagrams enables even the investigation of the importance of intermediate @xmath11 excitation .",
    "connected with the associated strangeness production is the quest for the existence of a pentaquark .",
    "most of the experimental searches were performed with electromagnetic probes on the neutron , which , of course , is embedded in a nucleus .",
    "a cleaner environment is the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "collision.,width=8 ]    the reaction studied with tof is the @xmath12 reaction .",
    "the @xmath13 is identified via its decay into two pions and the @xmath14 via its delayed decay .",
    "the data are shown in fig .",
    "[ pentaquark ] @xcite .",
    "there is evidence on a @xmath15 level for the production of a pentaquark @xmath16 with a subsequent decay of the @xmath17 into @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for the enormous body of papers related to pentaquark",
    "we refer to the talk by stancu @xcite .",
    "another intersting reaction is @xmath20 on order to reach the threshold of this reaction the maximal energy of cosy had to be lifted above its design value of 2.5 gev .",
    "the data were taken at an energy of 2.65 gev .",
    "the analysis of the data @xcite resulted in a dominance of the channel @xmath21 with a subsequent decay @xmath22 .    at the big karl",
    "spectrograph the reaction @xmath23 was studied with the momo vertex wall .",
    "the interest in this reaction stems from the surprising behaviour of two pions in the @xmath24 reaction @xcite .",
    "the latter reaction showed a p - wave between the two pions even close to threshold . in fig .",
    "[ kk_pipi ] the energy spectrum of two kaons for a maximal energy of 35 mev are shown .",
    "besides a smooth continuum the production of @xmath25-mesons is visible .",
    "the energy distribution follows phase space , hence it is s - wave .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the @xmath26@xmath27 system . also the excitation function for the @xmath25 production is an accord with the assumption of s - wave . to summarise",
    ": the @xmath26@xmath27 behaves as expected while the @xmath28@xmath27 system shows an unexpected behaviour . in order to proof the findings for this system",
    "the experiment was repeated but with inverse kinematics .",
    "the advantage of doing so is less settings of the spectrograph .",
    "a result of this measurement is also shown in fig . [ kk_pipi ] .",
    "it supports the previous findings .",
    "one aspect of strangeness physics is the @xmath29 content in the nucleon .",
    "this is connected to a violation of the ozi - rule in the ratio @xmath30 these two mesons have almost ideal quark mixing and hence the @xmath9 has negligible @xmath29 content while the @xmath25 is an almost pure @xmath29 state ( see previous reaction ) .",
    "tof measured @xmath9 production at exactly the same excess energy as previous @xmath25 production , thus allowing the deduction of @xmath31 as function of excess energy .",
    "this yields @xmath32 while the ozi - rule predicts @xmath33 .",
    "this may point to a serious content of @xmath29 pairs in the nucleon .",
    "there is a wealth of data of light meson production measured at cosy in the threshold region .",
    "the data were taken mainly by the cosy-11 and gem collaborations for the nucleon - nucleon channel @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 production were discussed by moskal @xcite at this meeting . here",
    "we will concentrate on @xmath36 reactions with @xmath37 or @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the latter reaction is of interest since the @xmath34-nucleus interaction might be attractive . from the differential cross sections one can deduce a matrix element @xmath40 as @xmath41 this quantity",
    "is shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ iso_threshold ] as function of the of the @xmath34 momentum @xmath42 .",

    "@xcite performed such an analysis with the result @xmath45 fm .",
    "this result is also shown in the figure .",
    "the second curve is from a. khoukaz which includes the preliminary cosy-11 data .",
    "the gem collaboration studied isospin symmetry breaking by comparing neutral and charged pion production in @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xcite ) reactions , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 reactions @xcite . for the latter reactions it was found that the angular distribution of the matrix elements consists of two parts .",
    "an exponential part showing scaling which is attributed to a one step reaction .",
    "this part shows isospin symmetry breaking .",
    "the second component is isotropic and is related to two step processes .",
    "it does not show isospin symmetry breaking .",
    "the origin of isospin symmetry breaking is in addition to the coulomb force a difference in the masses of the up and down quark .",
    "it was suggested @xcite to study the @xmath49 reaction at maximal momentum transfer around the @xmath34-production threshold .",
    "this channel should be sensitive to @xmath50-@xmath34 mixing with the mixing angle being dependent on the different quark masses .",
