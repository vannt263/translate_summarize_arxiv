    "tropical algebraic geometry is a relatively new language to study skeletons of algebraic varieties .",
    "introductions to tropical algebraic geometry are in  @xcite and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  9 ) .",
    "computational aspects are addressed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "one goal of this paper is to explain some new words of this language , and to show how a general purpose computer algebra system like maple is useful to explore and illustrate tropical algebraic geometry . for software dedicated to tropical geometry",
    ", we refer to gfan  @xcite , a singular library  @xcite , and trim  @xcite .",
    "the roots of tropical algebraic geometry run as deep as the work of puiseux  @xcite and ostrowski  @xcite , therefore our focus is on answering a practical question in computer algebra : _ when do two polynomials have a common factor ? _ viewing this question in tropical algebraic geometry leads to a symbolic - numeric algorithm .",
    "in particular , we will say that _",
    "tropisms give the germs to grow the tentacles of the common amoeba . _",
    "the paper is structured in four parts , each part explaining one of the key concepts of the tropical sentence .",
    "our perspective on tropical algebraic geometry originates from polyhedral homotopies  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to solve polynomial systems implementing bernshten s first theorem  @xcite .",
    "another related approach that led to tropical mathematics is idempotent analysis . in  @xcite",
    ", a maple package is presented for a tropical calculus with application to differential boundary value problems .",
    "related work on our problem concerns the factorization of sparse polynomials via newton polytopes  @xcite , @xcite ; approximate factorization  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the gcd of polynomials with approximate coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the polynomial absolute factorization is also addressed in  @xcite and the lectures in  @xcite offer a very good overview .",
    "criteria based on polytopes for the irreducibility of polynomials date back ostrowski  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we restrict our examples to polynomials in two variables and refer to polygons instead of polytopes .",
    "the terminology extends to general dimensions and polytopes , see  @xcite .    that two polynomials with approximate coefficients have a common factor is quite an exceptional situation .",
    "therefore it is important to have efficient preprocessing criteria to decide quickly .",
    "the preprocessing method we develop in this paper attempts to build a puiseux expansion starting at a common root at infinity . to determine whether a root at infinity is isolated or not we apply the newton - puiseux method , extending the proof outlined by robert walker in  @xcite , see also  @xcite , towards joseph maurer s general method  @xcite for space curves . a more algorithmic method than  @xcite is given in  @xcite along with an implementation in cocoa .",
    "general fractional power series solutions are described in  @xcite .",
    "see  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite for recent symbolic algorithms , and  @xcite , @xcite for a symbolic - numeric approach .",
    "the complexity for computing puiseux expansions for plane curves is polynomial  @xcite in the degrees . as an alternative to puiseux series , extended hensel series",
    "have been developed , see  @xcite for a survey .",
    "good numerical convergence is reported in  @xcite .",
    "we show that via suitable coordinate transformations , the problem of deciding whether there is a common factor is reduced to univariate root finding , with the univariate polynomials supported on edges of the newton polygons of the given equations .",
    "also in the computation of the second term of the puiseux series expansion , we do not need to utilize all coefficients of the given polynomials . in the worst case ,",
    "the cost of deciding whether is a factor is a cubic polynomial in the number of monomials of the given polynomials .",
    "certificates for the existence of a common factor consist of exact and approximate data : the exponents and coefficients of the first two terms of a puiseux series expansion of the factor at a common root at infinity .",
    "the leading exponents of the puiseux expansion form a so - called _ tropism _",
    "the coefficients are numerical solutions of overdetermined systems .",
    "if a more explicit form of the common factor is required , more terms in the puiseux expansion can be computed up to precision needed for the application of sparse interpolation techniques , see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "the convexhull and subs commands of maple are very valuable in implementing an interactive prototype of the preprocessing algorithm . for explaining the intuition behind the algorithm , we start illustrating amoebas and the tentacles .",
    "once we provide an abstraction for the tentacles we give an outline of the algorithm and sketch its cost .    * acknowledgements . *",
    "this paper is based on the talk the second author gave at mica 2008  milestones in computer algebra , a conference in honour of keith geddes 60th birthday , stonehaven bay , trinidad and tobago , 1 - 3 may .",
    "we thank the organizers for this wonderful and inspiring conference for their invitation .",
    "looking at the asymptotics of varieties gives a natural explanation for the newton polygon .",
    "this polygon will provide a first classification of the approximate coefficients of the given polynomials .",
    "this means that at first we may ignore coefficients of monomials whose exponents lie in the interior of the newton polygon .",
    "our input data are polynomials in two variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the set of values for @xmath0 and @xmath1 that make the polynomials zero is called a variety .",
    "varieties are the main objects in algebraic geometry . in 1971 , g.m .",
    "bergman  @xcite considered logarithms of varieties . in tropical algebraic geometry , we look at the asymptotics of varieties . @xmath2 because the logarithm is undefined at zero , we exclude the origin restricting the domain of our polynomials to the torus @xmath3 , @xmath4 . following  @xcite ,",
    "we arrive at our first new word  @xcite .",
    "the _ amoeba _ of a variety is its image under the log map .    to see what amoebas",
    "look like , we use the plotting capabilities of maple .",
    "we use polar coordinates ( see  @xcite for more on plotting amoebas ) to express a linear variety :    @xmath5.\\ ] ]    in figure  [ figamoeba1 ] we see the result of a maple plot .",
    "( 400,150)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 150,70 )    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     the elements of the set @xmath6 $ ] define the second term of the puiseux series expansion .",
    "in particular , for every @xmath7 $ ] : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the new coordinates after applying the transformation of definition  [ defcoordtrans ] .",
    "conditions on the existence of the exponent  @xmath10 are given in proposition  [ propsecexp ] .",
