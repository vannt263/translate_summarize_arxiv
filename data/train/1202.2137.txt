    "the standard model ( sm ) is the well established and extremely successfull theory of the elementary particles and their interactions @xcite . according to the sm ,",
    "matter is constituted by quarks and leptons and their interactions are due to the exchange of gauge bosons .",
    "the part of the sm which describes the strong interactions at the fundamental level is called quantum chromodynamics , or qcd @xcite . in qcd",
    "the quarks of six types , or flavors , ( up , down , strange , charm , bottom and top ) interact exchanging gluons .",
    "quarks and gluons have a special charge called color , responsible for the strong interaction .",
    "quarks and gluons do not exist as individual particles . due to the property of color confinement , quarks and gluons form clusters called hadrons , which can be grouped in baryons and mesons .",
    "the former are made of three quarks , as the proton , and the latter are made of a quark and an antiquark , as the pion .",
    "the quarks carry a fraction of the fundamental electric charge and a fraction of the baryon number .",
    "the electric and color charges and the baryon number are conserved quantities in qcd .    under extreme conditions of very large temperatures and/or very large densities , the normal hadronic matter undergoes a phase transition to a deconfined phase , a new state of matter called the quark gluon plasma , or qgp .",
    "together with the deconfinement phase transition , a second phase transition takes place : the chiral phase transition , during which chiral symmetry is restored and the light quarks ( up and down ) become massless . the hot qgp is produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and even more in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "the cold qgp may exist in the core of compact stars .",
    "the discovery of qgp revealed also that it behaves as an almost perfect fluid and its space - time evolution can be very well described by relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "after the discovery of this new fluid , more sophisticated measurements made possible to study the propagation of perturbations in the form of waves in the qgp .",
    "we may , for example , study the effect of a fast quark traversing the hot qgp medium . as is moves supersonically throughout the fluid",
    ", it generates waves of energy density ( or baryon density in the non relativistic case ) . in some works it was even claimed that these waves may pile up and form mach cones @xcite , which would affect the angular distribution of the produced particles , fluid fragments which are experimentally observed .",
    "the study of waves in the quark - gluon fluid has been mostly performed with the assumption that the amplitude of the perturbations is small enough to justify the linearization of the euler and continuity equations @xcite .",
    "as explained in the appendix , the analysis of perturbations with the linearized relativistic hydrodynamics leads to the standard second order wave equations and their travelling wave solutions , such as acoustic waves in the qgp .",
    "while linearization is justified in many cases , in others it should be replaced by another technique to treat perturbations keeping the nonlinearities of the theory .",
    "this is where a physical theory , in this case hydrodynamics , may benefit from developments in applied mathematics . indeed , since long ago there is a technique which preserves nonlinearities in the derivation of the differential equations which govern the evolution of perturbations .",
    "this is the reductive perturbation method ( rpm)@xcite .    in previous works",
    "we have applied the rpm to hydrodynamics and we have shown that the nonlinearities may lead , as they do in other domains of physics , to new and interesting phenomena . in the case of the cold qgp",
    "we have shown @xcite that it is possible to derive a korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation for the baryon density , which has analytic solitonic solutions .",
    "perturbations in fluids with different equations of state ( eos ) generate different nonlinear wave equations : the breaking wave equation , kdv , burgers ... etc . among these equations",
    "we find the kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) equation @xcite , which is a nonlinear wave equation in three spatial and one temporal coordinate .",
    "it is the generalization of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation to higher dimensions .",
    "the kp equation describes the evolution of long waves of small amplitudes with weak dependence on the transverse coordinates .",
    "this equation has been found with the application of the reductive perturbation method @xcite to several different problems such as the propagation of solitons in multicomponent plasmas , dust acoustic waves in hot dust plasmas and dense electro - positron - ion plasma @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work is to apply the rpm @xcite to relativistic fluid dynamics @xcite in cylindrical and cartesian coordinates to obtain the kp equation .",
    "we find that the transverse perturbations in relativistic fluid dynamics may generate three dimensional solitary waves .    in the present study of relativistic hydrodynamics",
    "we shall consider an equation of state derived from qcd @xcite .",
    "the obtained energy density and pressure contain derivative terms and a wave equation with a dispersive term such as kdv or kp emerges from the formalism . in @xcite , we have performed a similar study in one dimension and found a kdv equation .",
    "the present work is an extension of @xcite to three dimensions .",
    "previous studies on one - dimensional nonlinear waves in cold and warm nuclear matter can be found in @xcite .",
    "this text is organized as follows . in the next section we review the basic formulas of relativistic hydrodynamics . in section",
    "iii we derive the kp equation in detail . in section",
    "iv we solve the kp equation analytically and in section v we present some conclusions .",
    "for a detailed study in relativistic hydrodynamics we suggest the references @xcite .",
    "the relativistic version of the euler equation @xcite is given by : @xmath0 and the relativistic version of the continuity equation for the baryon density is @xcite : @xmath1 since @xmath2 the above equation can be rewritten as @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the lorentz factor . in this work",
    "we employ the natural units @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "recently @xcite we have obtained an eos for the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) at zero temperature .",
    "we performed a gluon field separation in `` soft '' and `` hard '' components , which correspond to low and high momentum components , respectively . in this approach",
    "the soft gluon fields are replaced by the in - medium gluon condensates .",
    "the hard gluon fields are treated in a mean field approximation and contribute with derivative terms in the equations of motion .",
    "such equations solved properly may provide the time and space dependence of the quark ( or baryon ) density @xcite .    due to the chiral phase transition",
    ", it is natural to assume that the quarks are massless and hence the system is highly relativistic . in relativistic theories , perturbations in pressure",
    "can propagate also in systems of massless particles . in the appendix ,",
    "starting from the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics , we derive a wave equation for a perturbation in the pressure , i.e. , an equation for an acoustic wave .",
    "the energy density is given by @xcite : @xmath7 @xmath8 and the pressure is : @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12    in ( [ eps ] ) and ( [ pres ] ) @xmath13 is the quark degeneracy factor @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the fermi momentum defined by the baryon number density : @xmath16    the other parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the coupling of the hard gluons , the dynamical gluon mass and the bag constant in terms of the gluon condensate , respectively .",
    "inserting ( [ eps ] ) and ( [ pres ] ) into ( 1 ) we can see that higher order derivatives in @xmath20 will appear . as it will be seen , the terms with these derivatives will generate the dispersive terms in the final kp equations .",
    "the terms with derivatives in ( [ eps ] ) and ( [ pres ] ) exist because of the coupling ( through the coupling constant @xmath17 ) between the quarks and the massive gluons ( @xmath21 ) . as explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gluon field is coupled to the quark baryon density through a klein - gordon equation of motion with a source term .",
    "the gluons can thus be eliminated in favor of the quark ( or baryon ) density , their inhomogeneities ( expressed by non - vanishing laplacians ) are tranferred to the quarks and terms proportional to @xmath22 appear . in short : dispersion comes ultimately from the interaction between quarks and gluons and their inhomogeneous distribution in space .",
    "we now combine the equations ( [ eul ] ) and ( [ rhobcons ] ) to obtain the kp equation which governs the space - time evolution of the perturbation in the baryon density using the eos given by ( [ eps ] ) and ( [ pres ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we will use the rpm to obtain the nonlinear wave equations @xcite . essentially , this formalism consists in expanding both ( [ eul ] ) and ( [ rhobcons ] ) in powers of a small parameter @xmath23 . in the following subsections we present the application of this formalism to relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "we start with the cylindrical kp ( ckp ) .",
    "similar radially expanding perturbations have been studied in one of our previous works @xcite in a simplified two - dimensional approach and with a simpler equation of state .",
    "the field velocity of the relativistic fluid is : @xmath24 and so @xmath25 . we rewrite the equations ( [ eul ] ) and ( [ rhobcons ] ) in dimensionless variables .",
    "the perturbations in baryon density occur upon a background of density @xmath26 ( the reference baryon density ) .",
    "it is convenient to write the baryon density as the dimensionless quantity : @xmath27 and similarly the velocity field as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the speed of sound .",
    "the components of the velocity are : @xmath30 and @xmath31    we next change variables from the space @xmath32 to the space @xmath33 using the `` stretched coordinates '' : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a typical scale of the problem which renders the stretched coordinates dimensionless .",
    "as it will be seen , the final wave equations in the three - dimensional cylindrical or cartesian coordinates do not depend on @xmath35 .",
    "the next step is the expansion of the dimensionless variables in powers of the small parameter @xmath23 : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40^{4/3 } \\cong 1+{\\frac{4}{3}}\\sigma\\rho_{1}+{\\frac{4}{3 } } \\sigma^{2 } \\rho_{2}+ \\dots \\label{roexpaqtrgain}\\ ] ] @xmath41^{1/3 } \\cong 1+{\\frac{1}{3}}\\sigma\\rho_{1}+{\\frac{1}{3 } } \\sigma^{2 } \\rho_{2}+ \\dots \\label{roexpautrgain}\\ ] ]    finally we neglect terms proportional to @xmath42 for @xmath43 and organize the equations as series in powers of @xmath23 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    from the euler equation ( [ eul ] ) we find for the radial component : @xmath46 { \\frac{\\partial v_{{r}_1}}{\\partial r}}+\\bigg[\\bigg({\\frac{27g^{2}\\,{\\rho_{0}}^{2}}{8{m_{g}}^{2}}}\\bigg ) + \\pi^{2/3}{\\rho_{0}}^{4/3}\\bigg ] { \\frac{\\partial\\rho_{1}}{\\partial r } } \\bigg\\rbrace\\ ] ] @xmath47{\\frac{\\partial\\rho_{2}}{\\partial r } } -\\bigg[\\bigg({\\frac{27g^{2}\\,{\\rho_{0}}^{2}}{8{m_{g}}^{2}}}\\bigg){c_{s}}^{2 } + 3\\pi^{2/3}{\\rho_{0}}^{4/3}{c_{s}}^{2}\\bigg]{\\frac{\\partial v_{{r}_2}}{\\partial r}}\\ ] ] @xmath48\\bigg({\\frac{\\partial v_{{r}_1}}{\\partial t } } + v_{{r}_1}{\\frac{\\partial v_{{r}_1}}{\\partial r}}\\bigg)\\ ] ] @xmath49 @xmath50\\rho_{1}{\\frac{\\partial v_{{r}_1}}{\\partial r}}\\ ] ] @xmath51v_{{r}_1}{\\frac{\\partial \\rho_{1}}{\\partial r } } + \\bigg({\\frac{9g^{2}\\,{\\rho_{0}}^{2}}{4{m_{g}}^{4}l^{2}}}\\bigg ) { \\frac{\\partial^{3 } \\rho_{1}}{\\partial r^{3 } } } \\bigg\\rbrace = 0 \\label{eulerxexpprgain}\\ ] ] for the angular component : @xmath52 { \\frac{\\partial v_{{\\varphi}_1}}{\\partial r}}\\ ] ] @xmath53{\\frac{1}{t } } { \\frac{\\partial\\rho_{1}}{\\partial \\phi } } \\bigg\\rbrace = 0 \\label{euleryexprpzgainphi}\\ ] ] and for the component in the @xmath54 direction : @xmath52 { \\frac{\\partial v_{{z}_1}}{\\partial r}}+\\bigg[\\bigg({\\frac{27g^{2}\\,{\\rho_{0}}^{2}}{8{m_{g}}^{2}}}\\bigg ) + \\pi^{2/3}{\\rho_{0}}^{4/3}\\bigg ] { \\frac{\\partial\\rho_{1}}{\\partial z } } \\bigg\\rbrace = 0 \\label{euleryexprpzgain}\\ ] ] performing the same calculations for the continuity equation ( [ rhobcons ] ) we find : @xmath55 @xmath56 in the last four equations each bracket must vanish independently and so @xmath57 . from the terms proportional to @xmath23 we",
