    "let @xmath2 denote the unique simply connected complete @xmath1-dimensional riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature @xmath3 , which we call the hyperbolic @xmath1-space .",
    "associated to a complete finite - total - curvature -@xmath0 ( constant mean curvature one ) conformal immersion @xmath4 of a riemann surface @xmath5 are two meromorphic maps called the hyperbolic gauss map and the secondary gauss map , which we denote by @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ( to be defined in the next section ) .",
    "using these two gauss maps , we can define two characteristics of the surface @xmath8 :    1 .",
    "it is known that @xmath5 is biholomorphic to a compact riemann surface with a finite number of points removed , and hence each end is conformally a punctured disk .",
    "therefore we may consider the order of the hyperbolic gauss map @xmath6 at each end , and an end is called _ regular _ if @xmath6 has at most a pole singularity at this end . if @xmath6 has an essential singularity , the end is called _",
    "irregular_. 2 .",
    "although @xmath6 is single - valued on @xmath5 , the secondary gauss map @xmath7 might be multi - valued on @xmath5 , so we can have a nontrivial monodromy representation defined on the first fundamental group of @xmath5 .",
    "this monodromy group is a subgroup of @xmath9 , and if all members of this group can be diagonalized by the same conjugation , we say that the surface @xmath8 is _",
    "reducible_. otherwise , we say that @xmath8 is _ irreducible_. ( irreducibility depends on a global behavior of the surface but not on individual ends . )",
    "if a -@xmath0 immersion is reducible , the surface can be deformed preserving its hyperbolic gauss map @xmath6 and hopf differential ( @xmath10-part of the second fundamental form , see section  [ sec : prelim ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , an irreducible surface is the only surface with given hyperbolic gauss map and hopf differential .",
    "recent progress in the theory of -@xmath0 surfaces in @xmath2 has led to the discovery of many new examples of these surfaces .",
    "many examples with regular ends are now known , and various properties of these surfaces are understood .",
    "bryant @xcite found a local description for these surfaces in terms of holomorphic data that initiated this recent progress .",
    "the last two authors @xcite@xcite developed the theory using bryant s description to find many examples and properties , and work in this direction has been continued by small @xcite , the authors @xcite@xcite , costa - sousa neto @xcite , earp - toubiana @xcite@xcite , yu @xcite@xcite , levi - rossman @xcite , barbosa - berard @xcite , do carmo and gomes and lawson and thorbergsson and silveira @xcite , and others .",
    "regarding properties of the ends of embedded examples , collin , hauswirth and rosenberg @xcite have recently shown that any embedded -@xmath0 surface of finite total curvature is either a horosphere or all of its ends are asymptotic to catenoid cousin ends . in @xcite",
    "it is further shown that any irregular end can not be embedded , and the limit points of such an end are dense at infinity .",
    "recently , pacard and pimentel @xcite established a method for attaching small handles between tangent horospheres and deforming to produce -@xmath0 surfaces , and this construction produces many embedded -@xmath0 surfaces of any genus .",
    "also , karcher @xcite has recently constructed periodic -@xmath0 surfaces with fundamental domains in several different types of compact quotients of @xmath2 .",
    "a typical example of an irregular end is the end of the enneper cousin , a surface first constructed by bryant @xcite .",
    "after that the last two authors @xcite constructed examples of genus zero and two irregular ends , and also many reducible -@xmath0 surfaces of genus zero whose ends are all irregular , using deformations from minimal surfaces .",
    "( the conclusion of remark 4.4 in @xcite contains an error .",
    "the number of ends should be @xmath11 , and hence the genus of @xmath12 is zero . ) recently , daniel @xcite has investigated irregular ends from the viewpoint of nevanlinna theory .",
    "after @xcite , no further surfaces with irregular ends and finite total curvature had been constructed .",
    "( however , such an example with infinite total curvature can be found in @xcite . ) in particular , until now no irreducible -@xmath0 surfaces with irregular ends and finite total curvature had been known .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to construct countably many @xmath0-parameter families of genus zero -@xmath0 surfaces with irregular ends and finite total curvature , which have either dihedral or platonic symmetries .",
    "we further show that examples with dihedral symmetries , and the simplest example with tetrahedral symmetry , must be irreducible .",
    "all of our examples have irregular ends of finite type in the sense of daniel @xcite .    to do the construction , we start with the meromorphic data for the genus zero irreducible -@xmath0 surfaces with regular ends found in @xcite and @xcite and modify this data to make surfaces with irregular ends .",
    "the spirit of the construction is similar to the construction of trinoids in @xcite , where -@xmath0 surfaces with prescribed gauss maps are constructed by reflecting spherical triangles , and we use monodromy killing arguments like in @xcite and @xcite , but the techniques are brought to bear more intricately here .    in section  [ sec : prelim ]",
    "we give necessary preliminaries . as our construction",
    "is done by reflecting abstract spherical triangles , we discuss this in section  [ sec : reflection ] , and introduce a method to construct -@xmath0 surfaces with irregular ends ( theorem  [ thm : gen ] ) , which is proved in section  [ sec : proof ] . as an application of the theorem",
    ", we construct examples of genus zero with either dihedral or platonic symmetries in section  [ sec : platonic ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : torus ] , we construct a -@xmath0 surface of genus @xmath0 with four irregular ends , which is the first known example with positive genus whose ends are all irregular .",

    "we remark that the secondary gauss map @xmath7 satisfies",
    "@xmath28    let @xmath29 be a null meromorphic map .",

    "then there exists a unique ( up to sign ) null meromorphic map @xmath50 such that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the hyperbolic gauss map and the secondary gauss map of @xmath16 .",

    "end if @xmath85 is at most a pole singularity of @xmath6 , and otherwise is called an _ irregular _ end .",
    "namely , an irregular end is an end at which the hyperbolic gauss map has an essential singularity .    on the other hand ,",
    "the hopf differential @xmath86 can always be extended as a meromorphic @xmath45-differential on @xmath79 .",

    "[ lem : irreg ] an end @xmath85 is regular if and only if @xmath91 .",

    "since @xmath73 is positive definite at @xmath102 , we have the following :    at umbilic points , the conical order of @xmath93 equals the order of @xmath86 .",
    "in this section , we introduce a method to construct -@xmath0 surface with irregular ends . in @xcite , examples with regular ends are constructed from the holomorphic data @xmath6 ( the hyperbolic gauss map ) and @xmath86 ( the hopf differential ) . however , since the hyperbolic gauss map has essential singularities at irregular ends , it is hard to find an explicit expression of @xmath6 in our case .",
