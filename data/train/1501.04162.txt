    "though the @xmath2-number of quantum systems can have various kinds of entanglement , the focusing point is the genuine multipartite entanglement because it can be used for various quantum information and computational tasks @xcite .",

    "two widely studied multipartite entangled states are ( i ) greenberger - horne- zeilinger ( ghz ) and ( ii ) w states .",
    "these two states are inequivalent and maximally entangled ones which are found applications in diverge topics including quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum secret sharing @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , splitting quantum information @xcite and enhancing the computational power @xcite . the stronger nonlocality displayed by these two multipartite entangled states",
    "also lead to many theoretical and experimental interests in quantum physics , see for example refs.@xcite .    identifying entanglement in the arbitrary multipartite states",
    "is not an easy task because in these systems one encounters many types of multiparticle entanglement .",
    "for example , the multipartite states may posses partially separable or @xmath0-separable and partially entangled or @xmath0-party entangled states @xcite .",
    "an @xmath2-partite system is @xmath0-separable if it can be separated into @xmath0-parts .",
    "for example , a @xmath3-partite state , @xmath4 , is @xmath5-separable if it can be separated into any one of the following forms , namely @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , an @xmath2-partite pure quantum state @xmath12 is called @xmath0- separable @xmath13 if and only if it can be written as a product of @xmath0 substates , that is @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , represents the state of a single subsystem or a group of subsystems @xcite .",
    "a mixed state @xmath17 is called @xmath0-separable , if it can be decomposed into pure @xmath0-separable states , that is @xmath18 where @xmath19 might be @xmath0-separable under different partitions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "an @xmath2-partite state is fully separable if @xmath22 and biseparable if @xmath23 .",
    "states that are not fully separable and not biseparable are called nonseparable and genuinely multipartite entangled states respectively .    the aim of the present work is to identify non-@xmath0- separability in the ghz and w classes of multipartite states .",
    "several conditions were proposed to detect genuine multipartite entanglement and nonseparability of multipartite states @xcite . to name a few , we cite the following : seevinck and uffink",
    "have proposed a set of inequalities , which can characterize various levels of partial separability and entanglement in multiqubit states @xcite .",
    "huber _ et.al .",
    "_ have proposed a general framework to obtain bilinear inequalities which can characterize the genuinely multipartite entangled mixed quantum states in arbitrary - dimensional systems @xcite . from the later gabriel _ et.al . _",
    "have developed an easily computable criterion to detect @xmath0-nonseparability in mixed multipartite states @xcite .",
    "recently ghne and seevinck have proposed the biseparability and full separability criteria for different classes of @xmath5-qubit and @xmath3-qubit states @xcite .",
    "these conditions were associated with density matrix elements .",
    "later gao and hong have generalized the separability criteria proposed by ghne and seevinck to @xmath2-qubit and @xmath2-qudit states and proved that their criteria is applicable for any partitions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-nonseparability criteria for the arbitrary dimensional mixed multipartite states was subsequently developed in ref.@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we extend the criteria given by gao and hong @xcite to @xmath0-separable @xmath2-partite states .",
    "for a given @xmath0 , violation of our criteria reveals the non-@xmath0-separability . with the help of our criteria",
    "one can detect non-@xmath0-separability in different classes of arbitrary dimensional @xmath2-partite states .",
    "we also illustrate the non-@xmath0-separability of mixed @xmath2-partite states with two examples .",
    "we formulate the separability conditions in terms of density matrix elements since these elements can be measured efficiently with local observables @xcite .",
    "the conditions presented in this paper are experimentally implementable without a full quantum state tomography .",
    "we also discuss how many local observables are required to implement the present criteria in experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we derive separability criteria to identify non-@xmath0-separable mixed @xmath2-partite quantum states . in sec.[sec3 ] we illustrate our criteria by considering @xmath2-qudit ghz and w states respectively mixed with white noise . in sec.[sec4 ] we calculate the number of local observables required to evaluate the criteria given in this work .",

    "in this section , we present the separability criteria to identify different classes of non-@xmath0-separable @xmath2-qudit states .",

    "suppose a state violates the inequality ( [ a5 ] ) for @xmath23 , then @xmath24 is a non-@xmath30-separable @xmath2-partite state or a genuinely @xmath2-partite entangled state @xcite .",

    "we formulate another criterion applicable for a class of @xmath2-qudit w states @xcite , which is not discussed in the earlier works @xcite .",
    "we mention here that the @xmath2-qudit w class state has several generalizations and in this work we consider only one generalization which was considered in ref.@xcite . to derive the condition for the @xmath2-qudit w states , we generalize the biseparability of @xmath2-qubit case @xcite to @xmath2-qudit case and obtain the following form of inequality which is suitable for non-@xmath0-separable @xmath2-qudit states .",

    "we then investigate the non-@xmath0-separability of @xmath2-partite w state mixed with white noise through the criterion 2 . in both the examples we consider the @xmath5-qutrit and @xmath3-qutrit cases and explain their nonseparability and genuine multipartite entanglement in detail .",
