    "we demonstrate the potential of the first principle calculations for providing such systematic and exhaustive information for ti@xmath0al@xmath1n alloyed with y , zr , hf , nb , and ta throughout the whole quaternary phase field . it is clearly shown that with some care",
    ", the calculated results can serve as reliable `` trend - givers '' for the materials design .",
    "lastly , it should be noted that in the paper we discuss only some related topics like the ground state properties , chemical strengthening , or onset of the spinodal decomposition ; others , such as the final decomposition phase ( precipitation of aln in its stable wurtzite ( b4 , zns prototype ) structure or influence on oxidation resistance , remain for the future studies .",
    "we used vienna ab initio simulation package @xcite employing the density functional theory @xcite to perform quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "the exchange and correlation effects were described with generalised gradient approximation as parametrised by wang and perdew @xcite , and implemented in projector augmented plane - wave pseudo - potentials @xcite .",
    "we used the supercell approach to model random alloys , in particular @xmath7 ( containing 36 atoms ) supercells were constructed for the cubic rock - salt b1 structures . to do so , we optimised the short - range order parameters for pairs up to the fourth nearest neighbour distance , for triplets up to the third nearest neighbour distance , and for quadruplets up to the second nearest neighbour distance , following the special quasi - random structures methodology @xcite . the same technique was applied also to construct @xmath8 supercells ( 32 atoms ) for the wurtzite b4 structures .",

    "the reason for the non - linear behaviour of @xmath19 can be traced back to the gradual changes in the bonding ( e.g. , from ionic to metallic character ) , as demonstrated for ti@xmath0al@xmath1n in ref .",

    "for example , bulk modulus of ti@xmath4al@xmath5hf@xmath6n varies between @xmath32 obtained for al - excess hf@xmath0al@xmath1n , and @xmath33 for tin @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : b]b ) . for the isovalent alloy ti@xmath4al@xmath5zr@xmath6n ,",
    "a similar behaviour is obtained ( fig .",

    "situation is somewhat different for the ti@xmath4al@xmath5nb@xmath6n and ti@xmath4al@xmath5ta@xmath6n alloys ( group vb ) , as nbn ( @xmath34 ) and tan ( @xmath35 ) @xcite , respectively , yield the highest bulk moduli of the quaternary systems investigated ( figs .",
    "[ fig : b]c and d ) . for these systems ,",
    "the main parameter controlling @xmath21 is the aln mole fraction , @xmath22 . finally , yet",
    "a completely different elastic response is obtained for ti@xmath4al@xmath5y@xmath6n alloy ( @xmath36 ) , where the bulk modulus reaches values well below @xmath37 for compositions in the centre of the compositional triangle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b]a ) .",
    "this is likely to be related to a strong instability of such material due to huge differences in the atomic size of individual species .        a comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig : alat]a and [ fig : b]d together with the data in table [ tab : data ] offers the possibility to design lattice matched superlattice materials ( i.e. multilayer arrangements with layer thicknesses within the order of the lattice parameter ) with variations in bulk modulus .",
    "for example , tin and hf@xmath38al@xmath39n have the same equilibrium lattice parameters of @xmath40 , but about @xmath41 difference in @xmath21 .",
    "another example is ti@xmath42al@xmath43zr@xmath44n and tan , both having lattice parameter @xmath45 , but the respective bulk moduli being @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "systems consisting of varying softer and harder components are known to be able to e.g. , hinder dislocation motion , or stop or deflect propagation of cracks @xcite .",
    "here , an additional benefit stems from expected perfect interfaces ( same crystal structures , lattice - matched ) .",
    "it has been shown that for cubic structured ti@xmath0al@xmath1n thin films , the hardness reaches a maximum for the highest al contents for which the cubic structure is still maintained @xcite .",
    "the chemical compositions with hardness maximum are close to ti@xmath48al@xmath49n for physical vapor - deposited coatings .",
    "these compositions provide also the highest driving force for decomposing towards their stable constituents , cubic tin and wurtzite aln , via a spinodal decomposition route .",
    "the calculated energies of formation , @xmath11 , of the cubic and wurtzite phases were interpolated with cubic polynomials in @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as implemented in the software package mathematica .",
    "equating @xmath50 yields the cross - over , an estimation of the cubic and wurtzite single phase fields . considering only small amounts of x ( i.e. , y , zr , nb , hf , or ta ) up to @xmath51 on the metallic sublattice , nb and ta do not change the maximum solubility of al in the cubic phase considerably @xcite , zr and hf decrease it slightly @xcite , while y decreases the al solubility limit within the cubic structure drastically from @xmath52 to @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the lowering of the solubility limit in the case of zr and hf is a result of widening of the dual - phase region in the zr@xmath0al@xmath1n and hf@xmath0al@xmath1n phase diagrams , as discussed in ref .",
    "the lowered solubility limit of y is likely to be connected with the large differences in the atomic sizes ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ) destabilising the close packed rock - salt structure while favouring the more open wurtzite structure .      in order to elucidate the role of individual elements , we use c - ti@xmath3al@xmath3n as a test composition . by replacing 1 al or 1 ti ( out of 18 on the metallic sublattice ) with 1 x atom , the alloy composition",

    "the relative phase stability change by alloying may be quantified by energy of formation expressing the energy gain of forming an alloy of a given composition with respect to the individual elements .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ef ] against the valence electron concentration ( vec ) which is calculated as an average value of valence electrons per formula unit ( f.u .",
    ", 1 metal and 1 nitrogen atom ) .",
    "ti ( [ ar]@xmath60 ) , al ( [ ne]@xmath61 ) , and n ( [ he]@xmath62 ) have 4 , 3 , and 5 valence electrons , respectively , hence vec of ti@xmath3al@xmath3n is @xmath63 .",
    "these results indicate that y , ta , nb , and zr slightly increase the energy of formation while hf works in the opposite direction .",
    "nevertheless , these changes are not large ( below @xmath64 ) and could be influenced by the actual supercell configuration .",
    "in addition , one should bear in mind that these are results of @xmath65 calculations , and thus the mutual differences may change at higher temperatures due to , e.g. vibrational contribution to the gibbs free energy .    in order to address the strengthening effect of the alloying elements , we first introduce cohesive energy calculated as @xmath66\\label{eq : ecoh}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the total energy of an isolated atom @xmath68 .",
    "based on this quantity , two energy terms are discussed : relative chemical strength , calculated as the cohesive energy difference between relaxed ti@xmath3al@xmath3n and ( unrelaxed ) ti@xmath3al@xmath3n+1x , where either one ti or al atom ( out of 18 in the supercell ) is replaced with one x atom . in the second step",
    "we allow for a full structural relaxation . the total energy ( or cohesive energy )",
    "decrease due to the relaxation ( with fixed chemical composition of the alloy ) corresponds to the elastic energy related to the local distortions caused by the foreign atom .",
    "these two contributions are shown in figs .",

    "[ fig : chem_elastic]a ) demonstrates the detrimental influence of y. for all the other elements the relative chemical strength of ( ti@xmath3al@xmath69x@xmath70n with respect to ti@xmath3al@xmath3n becomes more negative . the cohesive energy , as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : ecoh ] , expresses the energy ( per atom ) needed to de - assemble the crystalline material into individual atoms .",
    "since the elastic relaxation of the atom positions can only lower the total or cohesive energy , a negative / positive value of the relative chemical strengthening is an indicator for stronger / weaker bonded atoms in the crystal .",
    "this is a purely electronic effect ( a local change of the electronic structure ) and as such we interpreted it as electronic strengthening .",
    "consequently , the quaternary alloys with zr , hf , nb , and ta are expected to be more resistant against plastic deformation , leading e.g. , to a change in hardness of the alloys ( although there are many other aspects influencing material s hardness ) . indeed , a comparison with the experimental values taken from the literature , @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72 @xcite , @xmath73 @xcite , @xmath74 @xcite , @xmath75 @xcite , and @xmath76 @xcite , supports this qualitative trend .",
    "it should be mentioned that the experimental value of @xmath77 corresponds to a wurtzite single phase structure , a phase change caused by the addition of @xmath78 yn to ti@xmath3al@xmath3n .",
    "since the wurtzite phase is in general softer than the cubic one , this significant decrease in hardness is likely to combine both effect , the phase change as well as the weakening of the chemical bonding due to y. finally , the linear guide - for - the eye suggest that the chemical strength increases with increasing vec , at least in the investigated region .",
    "figure [ fig : chem_elastic]b shows how much elastic energy is introduced by local distortions into the material by alloying .",
    "the elastic energy is plotted against the volume per atom .",
    "the volume expansion in the first approximation equals to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the homogeneous isotropic strain . assuming the elastic constants are not significantly influenced by alloying , the elastic energy is proportional to @xmath81",
    "the quadratic fit gives qualitatively a good description as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : chem_elastic]b . taking into account the metallic radii of individual metal atoms ,",

    "<S> tailoring and improving material properties by alloying is a long - known and used concept . </S>",
    "<S> recent research has demonstrated the potential of _ ab initio _ calculations in understanding the material properties at the nanoscale . </S>",
    "<S> here we present a systematic overview of alloying trends when early - transition metals ( y , zr , nb , hf , ta ) are added in the ti@xmath0al@xmath1n system , routinely used as a protective hard coating . </S>",
    "<S> the alloy lattice parameters tend to be larger than the corresponding linearised vegard s estimation , with the largest deviation more than @xmath2 obtained for y@xmath3al@xmath3n . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical strengthening is most pronounced for ta and nb , although also causing smallest elastic distortions of the lattice due to their atomic radii being comparable with ti and al . </S>",
    "<S> this is further supported by the analysis of the electronic density of states . finally , mixing enthalpy as a measure of the driving force for decomposition into the stable constituents , </S>",
    "<S> is enhanced by adding y , zr and nb , suggesting that the onset of spinodal decomposition will appear in these cases for lower thermal loads than for hf and ta alloyed ti@xmath0al@xmath1n . </S>"
