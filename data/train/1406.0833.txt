    "<S> we study many - party correlations quantified in terms of the umegaki relative entropy ( divergence ) from a gibbs family known as a hierarchical model . </S>",
    "<S> we derive these quantities from the maximum - entropy principle which was used earlier to define the closely related irreducible correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we point out differences between quantum states and probability vectors which exist in hierarchical models , in the divergence from a hierarchical model and in local maximizers of this divergence . </S>",
    "<S> the differences are , respectively , missing factorization , discontinuity and reduction of uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss global maximizers of the mutual information of separable qubit states .    </S>",
