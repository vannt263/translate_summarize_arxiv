    "elasticity theory , in its most fundamental formulations , describes the statics and dynamics of three - dimensional ( 3d ) elastic bodies .",
    "such `` fundamental '' models are extremely complex , due to both high dimensionality and nonlinearity .",
    "this intrinsic complexity has motivated over the years the development of simplified , or reduced models of elasticity .",
    "in particular , models of lower spatial dimension have been developed to describe the mechanics of slender bodies , such as columns , shells and plates .",
    "these models are based on various approximations , such as lateral inextensibility , small deflections and small deformations . in particular",
    ", the kirchhoff - love assumptions @xcite allow the derivation of reduced two - dimensional ( 2d ) theories of plates .",
    "the fppl - von krmn ( fvk ) plate equations are one of the successful reduced descriptions of plates mechanics .",
    "it expresses the elastic energy of a deformed elastic plate as a sum of stretching and bending energies of a 2d surface . the stretching energy , which accounts for in - plane deformations , is linear in the plate thickness , @xmath0 .",
    "the bending energy , which depends on the curvature of the deformed plate , is cubic in @xmath0 .",
    "other reduced 2d theories usually bear the same structure , i.e. , their energy is given by the sum of a stretching term and a bending term @xcite .",
    "the validity of the dimensional reduction from 3d to 2d models , based on the kirchhoff - love assumptions , has been the subject of many scientific disputes @xcite .",
    "recently , the fvk theory has been derived from a 3d elastic theory by means of an asymptotic expansion @xcite .",
    "the stretching and bending terms in the fvk theory have also been derived as two different vanishing thickness @xmath1-limits of the 3d elastic energy @xcite .",
    "2d elastic theories distinguish between two types of thin bodies : plates and shells .",
    "plates are elastic bodies that bear no structural variation across their thin dimension , and possess a planar rest configuration .",
    "shells are elastic bodies that bear structural variations across their thin dimension , and as a result , possess a non - planar rest configuration . in both cases",
    "the postulated existence of a stress - free , rest configuration is of paramount importance .",
    "recent technological developments have extended the range of mechanical structures that can be engineered and constructed .",
    "plates of nanometer scale thickness can be manufactured @xcite , responsive nano - structures are being developed @xcite , and the use of shape memory materials that lead to large shape transformations has been extended @xcite .",
    "in addition , the application of mechanics to biological systems , such as in the study of plant mechanics and motility @xcite and the study of mechanically induced cell differentiation @xcite , is a rapidly developing field .",
    "such developments have renewed the interest in elasticity .",
    "several recent theoretical works have focused on the onset of various mechanical instabilities and the scaling of the generated patterns @xcite , and other thoroughly analyzed the assumptions underlying some of the dimensionally reduced models @xcite .",
    "the modeling of growing elastic bodies is an area in which current theories of elasticity face difficulties .",
    "growing tissues , such as leaves , exhibit very complex configurations even in the absence of external forces @xcite .",
    "although leaves ( and many other growing tissues ) are relatively thin ( compared to their lateral dimensions ) , there are no reduced 2d elastic theories that model their shaping mechanisms . another class of systems for which current theories do not apply are elastic bodies undergoing irreversible plastic deformations .",
    "the main difficulty in applying elasticity theory to growing bodies , or elastic bodies having undergone plastic deformations , is their _ lack of a stress - free configuration_. specifically , in most models , the elastic energy density of a deformed body depends on the local elastic modulus and the strain tensor .",
    "the latter is defined by the gradient of the mapping between a stress - free configuration and the deformed configuration .",
    "it can be shown , for example , that a general growth process of an elastic material leads to a body that has no stress - free configuration , thus exhibiting residual stress in the absence of external loading @xcite .    to formulate an elastic theory for bodies that do not have stress - free configurations",
    ", one needs an alternative definition of the strain tensor . at present , certain 3d formulations use the concepts of _ virtual configuration _ @xcite and _ intermediate configuration _ @xcite to describe natural growth processes as well as plastic deformations leading to residual stress .",
    "the growth process in these theories is decomposed into a _ growth step _",
    ", which maps a stress - free configuration into a virtual configuration , and an _ elastic relaxation step _ , which maps the virtual configuration into an elastic equilibrium configuration that contains residual stress .",
    "these theories use a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic and a plastic part .",
    "other theories decompose the strain tensor additively @xcite .    in the current work ,",
    "we focus on the elastic response of the body after its  rest configuration \" has been modified either by growth , or by plastic deformation .",
    "we do not consider the thermodynamic limitations on plastic deformations ( which are not relevant to naturally growing tissue ) .",
    "we assume that the distorted  rest configuration \" ( or virtual configuration ) is a known quantity .",
    "if an elastic body is capable of assuming the virtual configuration , then there exists a stress - free configuration , which is unique ; the solution to the elastic problem is then trivial . if , however , no elastic body can assume the virtual configuration , then no stress - free configuration exists , and we face a non - trivial problem which exhibits residual stress .",
    "we term such bodies as  non - euclidean \" because their internal geometry is not immersible in three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we consider now two model examples of elastic structures that belong to the class of systems we have termed non - euclidean plates , and discuss qualitatively some of their properties .",
    "consider an elastic square slab of lateral dimensions @xmath2 , and thickness @xmath0 .",
    "suppose we cut out from it a square segment of dimension @xmath3 , leaving out a u - shaped structure ( see figure [ fig : slab]@xmath4 ) .",
    "next , the square is replaced by a trapezoid that has three edges of equal length @xmath3 , and a fourth edge of longer size @xmath5 .",
    "of course , the trapezoid is too large to fit in the square slot .",
    "suppose , however , that we forcefully insert the trapezoid into the slot , gluing its three sides of length @xmath3 to the corresponding edges of the u - shape . as a result ,",
    "the u - shape will slightly open , whereas the trapezoid will experience compression .",
    "this plane - stress configuration is shown schematically in figure [ fig : slab]@xmath6 .",
    "if the plates are sufficiently thin , the trapezoid is unable to sustain the compression and buckles out of plane to form a shape qualitatively described in figure [ fig : slab]@xmath7 .",
    "we note the following points for this toy problem :    1 .",
    "the three dimensional metric that describes the _ rest lengths _ of the compound body ( u - shape plus trapezoid ) is continuous .",
    "if @xmath8 denotes the vertical coordinate ( say , the distance from the bottom face ) , then all @xmath9 surfaces are identical .",
    "it is this property that causes the body to remain flat ( for sufficiently thick samples ) , and will later be used to rigorously define non - euclidean plates .",
    "the body exhibits residual stress in the absence of external constraints : in figure [ fig : slab]@xmath6 the body is in a state of non - trivial plane - stress , identical for all @xmath9 sections . in the buckled state ( figure [ fig : slab]@xmath7 ) symmetry",
    "is broken .",
    "the upper surface is longer then the lower surface , hence at least one of them must be strained .",
    "it may easily be shown that the _ compound _ body has no unstressed configuration .",
    "the problem is purely geometric : as both pieces ( the confining u and the trapezoid ) are made of the same material , the stiffness of the material ( young s modulus ) has no effect on the equilibrium shape , and we expect to see the same behavior for metals and rubbers ( as long as the strains are sufficiently small and the stresses are below the yield stress ) .",
    "the toy problem presented here may easily be solved numerically using commercial software ( in fact , a very similar problem was addressed experimentally and analytically in @xcite ) .",
    "the treatment used for solving such problems is limited to _ discrete _ geometric incompatibilities : two ( or more ) regular elastic problems that are coupled through their boundary conditions are solved simultaneously .",
    "plastic deformations and non - homogeneous growth processes , however , can not be mapped into such discrete geometries .",
    "recent experiments in torn plastic sheets @xcite and environmentally responsive gel discs @xcite have attracted attention to a specific class of non - euclidean elastic bodies : thin bodies whose shaping mechanism is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "growing leaves display such behavior , as their growth is believed to be nearly homogeneous across their thin dimension , and inhomogeneous in the lateral dimensions .",
    "the gel discs reported in @xcite mimic a growing thin 3d body shaped by a 2d growth process . in these experiments",
    "initially flat stress - free objects shrink according to a pre - determined chemical gradient in their composition .",
    "the shrinking is homogeneous across the thickness , but inhomogeneous in the lateral directions ( see figure [ fig : caps ] for an example ) .",
    "the resulting body shows no structural variation across its thin dimension , yet the lateral equilibrium distances , specified by the differential shrinking , define a 2d non - euclidean metric tensor .",
    "thus , they can not be preserved in any flat configuration of the disc .",
    "such bodies may not be considered as plates ( due to their non - planar intrinsic geometry ) , nor as shells ( as there are no structural variations across the thin dimension ) .",
    "we name such bodies non - euclidean plates .",
    "the configurations of non - euclidean plates in the absence of external forces are not flat ( figure  [ fig : caps]@xmath7 and [ fig : caps]@xmath10 ) , and may exhibit multi - scale , and fractal - like configurations @xcite .",
    "finite element simulations devised to describe such bodies @xcite , were able to obtain such multi - scale configurations as energy minima . in both computational and theoretical works",
    ", it was assumed that the elastic energy can be written as a sum of bending and stretching terms .",
    "the bending was measured with respect to a locally flat configuration ( as in the fvk plate model ) , and the stretching was evaluated with respect to a reference 2d metric tensor .",
    "none of these works , however , was backed up with a theoretical justification for such assumptions .",
    "the thicknesses of the gels are @xmath12 mm and @xmath13 mm .",
    ", height=76 ]    in the present work we derive a reduced 2d elastic theory for non - euclidean plates and discuss their characteristics .",
    "the derivation starts from a model of a 3d covariant ",
    "incompatible \" elasticity , that is , a model for 3d bodies whose intrinsic metric can not be immersed in a 3d euclidean space .",
    "we advocate that the common definition of strains with respect to a stress - free configuration is too restrictive .",
    "instead , strains can be measured with respect to a _ reference metric tensor _ , which is not necessarily immersible in 3d euclidean space ( incompatibility ) .",
    "when the strain tensor is defined with respect to a metric tensor , growth ( or any other metric prescription ) is naturally decoupled from the elastic relaxation .",
    "the second cauchy - piola stress tensor ( which is linear in the strain for small strains ) , may be written explicitly in terms of the difference between two metric tensors .",
    "in such a formulation residual stress appears inevitably as a result of the lack of immersibility . .",
    "we apply this formulation to thin elastic plates , using the kirchhoff - love assumptions .",
    "when applied to ordinary plates , our theory coincides with the koiter plate theory @xcite .",
    "as in the fvk and koiter theories , the energy of the plate is a sum of stretching and bending terms .",
    "the bending term is cubic in @xmath0 and quadratic in surface curvatures .",
    "the stretching term is linear in @xmath0 and depends on the difference between the 2d metric tensor of the configuration and the reference metric @xmath14 , ( in @xcite it was termed ",
    "target metric \" ) the covariant elasticity formulation , together with the bending term measures deviations from a flat configuration , while the stretching term measures deviations from the 2d reference metric ( which may be non - flat ) .",
    "the resulting model is simple to use , and has an intuitive structure , which clarifies the underlying physics .",
    "we end this paper with an application of the theory to a simple case of a hemispherical plate .",
    "in this section we derive the energy functional of a three - dimensional elastic body as a function of its metric using general curvilinear coordinates .",
    "we will show that the energy functional takes the following form , @xmath15 where we use the einstein summation convention and @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the metric tensor , @xmath18 is a symmetric positive - definite tensor , which we term the _ reference metric _ , and @xmath19 are elasticity ( lam ) constants ; for tensors @xmath20 denotes the determinant . this energy functional neglects terms that are of order higher than quadratic in @xmath21 , which is the deviation of the metric from the reference metric . for bodies which possess a stress - free configuration ,",
    "@xmath14 may be called the rest metric and must comply with six additional differential constraints ( the vanishing of the ricci curvature tensor ) .",
    "precise definitions will be provided in the following subsections . for a thorough treatment of bodies that have a stress - free configuration ,",
    "the reader is referred to the recent introductory book by ciarlet @xcite , which contains the mathematical background to the subject .",
    "a similar treatment , which we consider as a starting point for our generalization , can be found in koiter @xcite .",
    "we derive the energy functional in a slightly different manner , yet we try as far as possible to use the notations of @xcite , later adopted in @xcite .",
    "when a body ( a compact domain @xmath22 ) is endowed with a regular set of material curvilinear coordinates @xmath23 , it is also endowed with an induced metric tensor .",
    "specifically , if @xmath24 denotes the mapping from the domain of parametrization , @xmath25 , into @xmath26 ( we call @xmath24 the _ configuration _ of the body ) , then the endowed metric is @xmath27 . here and below we use roman lower - case letters @xmath28 for indices @xmath29 ; the operator @xmath30 denotes the partial derivative with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "any deformation of the body ( carrying the coordinates along with every material point ) will result in a different metric tensor .",
    "a rigidity theorem states that if the induced metrics of two configurations @xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfy @xmath34 for every @xmath35 , then the two configurations can only differ by a rigid motion ( a uniform translation and a rigid rotation ) .",
    "thus , the metric ( provided that it is immersible in @xmath36 ) uniquely defines the physical configuration of a three - dimensional body .",
    "our main postulate , which may be viewed as a modification of the hyper - elasticity principle originally formulated by truesdell @xcite , is :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the elastic energy stored within a deformed elastic body can be written as a volume integral of a local elastic energy density , which depends only on ( i ) the local value of the metric tensor , and ( ii ) local metrial properties that are independent of the configuration . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the tensors that characterize the material and the body  the _",
    "elastic tensors_contain all the information about the elastic moduli and the intrinsic geometry of the body .",
    "truesdell s hyper - elasticity principle is formulated in terms of the strain tensor , which requires the existence of a stress - free reference configuration .",
    "in contrast , our postulate is formulated in terms of the metric tensor .",
    "this obviates the need of a rest configuration , hence allows for residual stress .",
    "let @xmath37 be the energy density per unit volume .",
    "the total elastic energy is @xmath38 our postulate states that the function @xmath37 depends on the metric @xmath39 and on the coordinates @xmath40 ( through the elastic tensors ) , i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "we make the following additional assumptions :    1 .",
    "2 .   for every @xmath43",
    "there exists a unique metric @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "we call @xmath14 the reference metric .    in the present work we consider the reference metric @xmath14 to be a known quantity , whereas the unknown is @xmath39 , the  actual \" metric of the configuration .",
    "it turns out to be more convenient to define the energy density per unit volume with respect to the volume element induced by the reference metric .",
    "we therefore define @xmath46 as the new energy density .",
    "note that the previous assumptions on @xmath37 carry over to @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 if we additionally assume that @xmath49 is twice - differentiable with respect to @xmath39 in the vicinity of @xmath14 , then for small deviations of the metric @xmath39 from the reference metric @xmath14 our assumptions imply that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the deviation of the metric from the reference metric , and @xmath52 can depend on @xmath14 but not on @xmath39 .",
    "note that if there exists a rest configuration ( @xmath14 is an immersible metric ) , then we may choose the coordinates @xmath40 to be the standard cartesian coordinates on the undeformed configuration , thus setting @xmath53 .",
    "in such case we may define the displacement vector @xmath54 to obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "we therefore identify @xmath57 as the _ green - st .",
    "venant strain tensor_. the frechet derivative of the energy density @xmath47 with respect to @xmath57 is the contravariant _ second piola - kirchhoff stress tensor _",
    "@xcite @xmath58    for small strains we only need to determine the rank - four contravariant elasticity tensor @xmath52 .",
    "regardless of what @xmath14 is at any given point @xmath59 , we may always choose a re - parametrization @xmath60 such that the reference metric with respect to the new ( local ) system of coordinates satisfies @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "if the medium is isotropic , then the tensor @xmath63 at @xmath62 is isotropic in the cartesian coordinates @xmath60 , hence must be of the form @xmath64 for some constants @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite . for a body with a reference rest configuration , we may identify these constants as the lam coefficients .",
    "it remains to transform the contravariant tensor @xmath67 , defined on the local euclidean coordinates @xmath60 , back to the original curvilinear coordinates @xmath40 using the transformation rules for tensors , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the jacobian of the transformation ( see appendix  [ tensors ] ) . as the strain tensor transforms with the jacobian @xmath70 we obtain that @xmath71 . since all the orientation - preserving cartesian coordinate transformations differ only by a proper orthogonal rotation , this equation holds independently of the particular local cartesian set @xmath60 .",
    "the only implication of this calculation is that @xmath14 must be symmetric and positive - definite , i.e. it is indeed a metric . yet , this metric is not required to be immersible in @xmath36 , which is why we refer to our theory as  incompatible \" elasticity .",
    "if we now define the reciprocal reference metric by @xmath72 , and substitute in , using the fact that @xmath73 , we obtain expression for the energy density .",
    "as described in appendix [ tensors ] , differentiation and the lowering and raising of indices are both defined with respect to the reference metric .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are not tensors in the sense defined in appendix  [ tensors ] ( @xmath75 is kronecker s delta and not the lowered - index unit tensor ) .",
    "moreover , given a metric @xmath17 there exists a reciprocal metric tensor @xmath76 which is a contravariant tensor of rank two and satisfies @xmath77 , however it is not obtained by raising the indices of @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath78 . the reference metric is the _ only _ tensor for which the inverse is obtained by raising both indices .",
    "the equations of elastic equilibrium are obtained from the energy functional by a variational principle .",
    "we express the energy as a functional of the metric tensor , @xmath39 , yet variations of @xmath39 must take into account that its components satisfy six differential constraints , which are the vanishing of the ricci curvature tensor .",
    "alternatively , we may vary the configuration @xmath24 , in which case the induced variation in @xmath39 trivially satisfies the six constraints .",
    "thus , @xmath79 integrating by parts , and using the fact that @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the christoffel symbols associated with the configuration @xmath24 , we obtain after straightforward algebra the following boundary value problem , @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the christoffel symbols associated with the reference metric , @xmath84 is the unit normal ( in @xmath36 ) to @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the covariant derivative with respect to the reference metric ( see appendix [ tensors ] ) .",
    "as the elastic body is immersed in @xmath36 the six independent components of the symmetric ricci curvature tensor of the metric @xmath39 @xmath87 must all vanish .",
    "the three equations together with the six immersibility conditions for @xmath39 , form a set of nine equations , for the six unknowns in @xmath39 .",
    "there are two possible ways to resolve this seemingly over - determination .",
    "the first is by noticing that the six independent components of the ricci curvature tensor satisfy differential relations : their derivatives are related through the second bianchi identity .",
    "the second way of resolving this issue is by identifying the immersion @xmath24 as the three unknown functions , in which case the six equations in are solvability conditions for the pde .",
    "however , as the equations in @xmath24 are of higher order we need to supply additional conditions , namely set the position and the orientation of the body , in order to obtain a unique solution for @xmath24 .",
    "is our fundamental model for three - dimensional elasticity .",
    "the only ( yet fundamental ) difference with standard models of finite displacement elasticity is that the reference metric does not necessarily have an immersion in @xmath36 .",
    "we define a plate as an elastic medium for which there exists a curvilinear set of coordinates in which the _ reference _ metric takes the form @xmath88 a plate is called _ even _ if the domain @xmath89 of the curvilinear coordinates can be decomposed into @xmath90 $ ] , where @xmath91 and @xmath0 is constant .",
    "thus an even plate is fully characterized by the metric of its mid - surface @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 denote an area element on the mid - surface , and @xmath94 be the total area of the mid - surface .",
    "an even plate will be called _ thin _ if @xmath95 .",
    "a plate will be called _ non - euclidean _ if the ricci curvature tensor of its reference metric does not vanish .",
    "an equivalent condition is that the mid - surface ( considered as a two - dimensional manifold ) has a non vanishing gaussian curvature .",
    "a non - euclidean plate has no immersion with zero strain in @xmath96 , i.e. the equilibrium state of a non - euclidean plate must be a frustrated state exhibiting residual stress .",
    "this statement is rather intuitive : if the plate fully complies with its given two - dimensional metric , then it must assume a three - dimensional form that violates the invariance along the thin direction .",
    "if , on the other hand , it remains planar , then it can not comply with a non - vanishing gaussian curvature , hence it must contain in - plane deformations .",
    "although thin plates are three - dimensional bodies , one would like to take advantage of their large aspect ratio and model them as two - dimensional surfaces , thus reducing the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "ideally , one would hope to obtain a reduced two - dimensional theory as an assumption - free small-@xmath0 limit of the three - dimensional theory .",
    "unfortunately , such an analysis is still lacking , and one must introduce additional assumptions .",
    "we adopt the kirchhoff - love assumptions regarding the structure of the configuration metric @xmath39",
    ". the standard formulation of the kirchhoff - love assumptions is :    1 .",
    "the body is in a state of plane - stress ( the stress is parallel to the deformed mid - surface ) .",
    "points which are located in the undeformed configuration on the normal to the mid - surface at a point @xmath62 , remain in the deformed state on the normal to the mid - surface at @xmath62 , and their distance to @xmath62 remains unchanged .",
    "the first assumption may be reformulated as @xmath97 in our case , where no reference configuration exists , the second assumption may be rewritten as @xmath98 where following @xcite greek indices @xmath99 assume the values @xmath100 .",
    "it is important to note that the assumptions @xmath101 and @xmath102 represent two different elastic problems  plane - stress versus plane - strain problems respectively .",
    "the two stand in contradiction for all @xmath103 . as a result ,",
    "the two assumptions do not  commute \" , i.e. the order in which the two assumptions are applied is crucial .",
    "the key assumption is the first one , @xmath101 .",
    "it states that most of the elastic energy is stored in lateral ( in - plane ) deformations of the various constant-@xmath8 planes .",
    "estimates of deviations from this assumption may be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath104 and @xmath105 be the principal curvatures of the mid - surface , @xmath106 , and let @xmath3 be the smallest lateral length scale appearing in the elastic equilibrium .",
    "it may be shown that the plane - stress approximation holds for @xmath107 the second assumption , @xmath102 , is introduced only after we already have a reduced energy density , containing only plane - stress contributions .",
    "it determines the actual three - dimensional configuration the body assumes and the variation of the plane - stress along the thin dimension .",
    "it enables us to relate the elastic energy density to geometric properties of the midplane which is considered as a two - dimensional surface .",
    "following @xcite we denote by @xmath108 the maximal plane - stress of the midplane and note that adding terms of orders @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 to the energy density would not modify the order of the approximation .",
    "thus the second assumption may be considered as a subsidiary assumption , used to bring the elastic energy density to the simplest consistent form .",
    "although the assumptions are physically plausible , reducing the three - dimensional energy functional into a two - dimensional functional by means of @xmath1-convergence would set the current theory of firmer grounds .",
    "we now exploit the modified kirchhoff - love assumptions to derive a reduced two - dimensional model .",
    "combining and and using the tensorial rules for raising indices we get @xmath112 from the first assumption , @xmath113 , and the fact that @xmath114 and @xmath115 , follows that @xmath116 we use to rewrite the energy density only in terms of the two - dimensional strain , @xmath117 or equivalently @xmath118 note that as we contract the tensors @xmath119 and @xmath120 with symmetric tensors we only retain their symmetric part .",
    "so far we have only used the first of the kirchhoff - love assumptions .",
    "we now use the second assumption to express the energy functional as a two - dimensional integral over the mid - surface , by integrating @xmath47 over the thin coordinate @xmath8 . as @xmath121 and @xmath122 ,",
    "we identify @xmath123 as the unit vector normal to the constant-@xmath8 surfaces .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that @xmath124 , implying that @xmath125 is the unit normal to the mid - surface , and @xmath126 .",

    "a two - dimensional configuration has zero stretching energy if and only if @xmath152 , i.e. , if the two - dimensional metric coincides with the reference metric ( such a configuration is an _",

    "it has two terms : the stretching energy , which scale linearly with @xmath0 , and the bending energy , which scales like the third power of @xmath0 .",

    "the first uses independent variations of the six components of the symmetric tensors @xmath160 and @xmath161 , adding three lagrange multipliers to impose the three gauss - mainardi - peterson - codazzi ( gmpc ) equations : @xmath162    the gmpc equations are the necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath160 and @xmath161 to be the first and second fundamental forms of a surface in @xmath36 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the satisfaction of the gmpc equations is a sufficient condition for the immersibility of a metric of the form @xcite .",

    "the reduced two - dimensional equilibrium equations are highly nonlinear equations in the six variables @xmath175 , @xmath176 .",
    "a tractable set of equations may be obtained if , for example , symmetries are imposed .",

    "we seek solutions in the form of a body of revolution @xmath181 for such configurations the gmpc equations are satisfied trivially .",
    "the first and second fundamental forms are given by @xmath182 if we define @xmath183 ( which implies that @xmath184 ) , then , substituting the fundamental forms into the two - dimensional energy density , we obtain the following expression for the energy , @xmath185 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are the densities of the stretching and bending contents .",

    "the minimizer of the energy functional was computed numerically for the parameters @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "the elastic modulus @xmath139 , which is immaterial to the equilibrium shape , was set such that the pre - factor @xmath204 equals one .",

    "all three energies are divided by @xmath0 .",
    "the three rendered configurations correspond to ( from right to left ) : a flat configuration , a weakly buckled configuration , just below the buckling threshold , and a fully buckled , almost isometric configuration ( color online).,height=259 ]    in figure  [ fig : energy ] we plot the stretching energy ( red circles ) , the bending energy ( blue crosses ) and the total energy ( black diamonds ) versus the plate thickness @xmath0 ; all three energies were scaled by @xmath206 . except for a narrow transition region near the buckling threshold ,",
    "the total energy is dominated by either the stretching energy or the bending energy .",
    "as one would expect , the bending energy drops to zero above the buckling threshold ( large thickness ) .",
    "however , below the buckling threshold , as @xmath148 , the stretching energy drops to zero much more rapidly than the bending energy .",
    "this last observation is in fact surprising , as naively , one would expect equilibrium to be attained when both stretching and bending energy are  equally partitioned \" @xcite .",
    "( left ) , and spatial profile ( right ) near the buckling threshold as a function of the thickness .",
    "every profile in the right figure corresponds to an energy variation bearing the same color in the left figure .",
    "all configurations are flatter than the center disc in figure  [ fig : energy ] ( note the difference in scales of the axis on the right).,height=192 ]    in figure [ fig : buckling ] the spatial profile ( a cross - section ) of the elastic equilibrium configuration is shown .",
    "the transition from flat to buckled configurations occurs continuously , hence the buckled states , close to the buckling threshold , are nearly planar .",
    "this supports the validity of theories that assume small deflections from a plane ( such as the fvk model ) for predicting the buckling threshold . as the thickness",
    "is further reduced , the plate approaches the stress - free ( isometric ) configuration very fast .",
    "the assumption of small deflections from a plane fails for such configurations .",
    "the minimal bending content , @xmath207 , of the stretch - free configuration , and the minimal stretching content , @xmath208 , of the zero bending configuration yield a crossover length scale : @xmath209 .",
    "linear analysis about a flat surface gives another length scale , the buckling threshold thickness @xmath210 .",
    "we expect the scenario depicted in figure [ fig : energy ] to be valid for bodies in which these two length scales are relatively close . however , there are reference metrics ( specifically , hyperbolic ) , for which all isometric immersions are convoluted , i.e. @xmath207 is very large .",
    "for such bodies one may obtain @xmath211 .",
    "when this occurs , the transition region may expand .",
    "for such bodies the scaling of the elastic equilibrium energy with the thickness will be very different from the one appearing in figure [ fig : energy ] .",
    "natural growth of tissue as well as the plastic deformation of solids are examples of local shaping mechanisms of elastic bodies . in general ,",
    "the local nature of such growth processes excludes the existence of stress - free configurations .",
    "this is the main reason why current elastic theories can not handle properly such shaping mechanisms . in this work we derived a reduced 2d model for a class of thin plates with residual stresses , which we named `` non - euclidean plates '' .",
    "such plates are uniform across their thin dimension , but their 2d geometry is non - euclidean .",
    "their complicated 3d configurations can not be obtained from existing 2d models of elasticity .",
    "our derivation is based on a covariant formulation of 3d linear elasticity",
    ". it does not require the existence of a reference stress - free configuration , but only a 3d `` reference metric '' tensor , which is determined by the growth .",
    "we use this formalism together with the kirchhoff - love assumptions to derive a 2d energy functional . like preceding theories ,",
    "this functional decouples into bending and stretching terms .",
    "the bending term scales like the third power of the thickness and depends on surface curvature .",
    "the stretching term scales linearly with the thickness and increases with in - plane strain , which is nothing but the difference between the 2d metric tensor of a configuration and the 2d reference metric .",
    "our theory is valid for large rotations and displacements and arbitrary intrinsic metrics .",
    "the numerical results presented in figure [ fig : energy ] suggest that in the general case there is no equipartition between bending and stretching energies .",
    "this in turn supports the treatment of very thin bodies as inextensible . not only the equilibrium three - dimensional configuration is dominated by the minimization of the  small \" bending energy term , but the total elastic energy is dominated by it too .",
    "the estimate of what thickness should be considered as thin involves the introduction of a new length scale @xmath212 , which is smaller than the buckling threshold thickness .",
    "the square of this new length scale , @xmath213 , is inversely proportional to the minimum of the willmore functional for the prescribed @xmath214 geometry .",
    "this length scale differentiates between two types of surface geometries .",
    "surfaces which may be isometrically immersed with a moderate bending content , for which @xmath212 is close to the buckling threshold thickness , will follow the shaping scenario and energy profile described in figures [ fig : energy ] and [ fig : buckling ] .",
    "surfaces for which all isometric immersions have high bending contents ( as is the case for some hyperbolic surfaces ) may exhibit very different shaping scenarios and energetic landscapes .",
    "the theory can be further elaborated and generalized to describe a wider range of growing bodies .",
    "we believe , however , that already in its current stage , it is a powerful tool for studying the growth of leaves and other natural slender bodies .    *",

    "the coordinate transformation gradient , often denoted by @xmath219 , is simply the jacobian matrix of the transformation @xmath220 , i.e. @xmath221 . the inverse transformation gradient is @xmath222 .",

    "given a parametrization @xmath224 , a scalar @xmath225 induces a function @xmath226 defined by @xmath227 .",
    "given another parametrization @xmath228 with the coordinate transformation @xmath229 , the relation between the induced functions @xmath189 and @xmath230 is @xmath231 . by a slight abuse of terminology",

    "we may construct a basis @xmath234 for each tangent space .",
    "with respect to this basis we may write any vector as @xmath235 .",
    "the three functions @xmath236 are called the contravariant components of the vector @xmath232 . again by an abuse of terminology the triplet @xmath237 is called a contravariant vector .",

    "we next define the dual vector space , namely the space of covariant vectors",

    "there corresponds a covariant dual given by @xmath256 .",
    "the tensor @xmath14 is called the covariant metric on @xmath26 .    given a parameterized manifold @xmath224 one may easily prove that the gradient of a scalar @xmath257 is a covariant vector . however in order to differentiate vectors we need to compare vectors that belong to different tangent spaces . to do",
    "so we use parallel transport of one of the vectors to the point where the other vector is defined . to give only a notion of what parallel transport is",
    ", we say that it will be transporting the vector along a `` straight line '' , keeping a constant angle between the line and the vector . both concepts , angles between a curve and a vector , as well as",
    " straight lines \" ( geodesics ) , are defined by the covariant metric tensor .",
    "thus , while the differentiation of a scalar is independent of the metric , the differentiation of a vector depends on the metric . it may be shown that the parallel transport procedure results in the following definition of the covariant derivative .",
