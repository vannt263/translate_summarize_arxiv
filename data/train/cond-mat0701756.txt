    "the recent progress in experimental and theoretical studies of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of dilute atomic gases @xcite has been tremendous after their experimental realization @xcite .",
    "this has also led to an explosion of interest in the theme of nonlinear matter - waves such as dark @xcite , bright @xcite and gap @xcite solitons .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) nonlinear excitations of becs , such as vortices @xcite and vortex lattices @xcite , were also realized experimentally , while a multitude of other coherent nonlinear structures were also theoretically predicted ; these include , e.g. , faraday waves @xcite , ring dark solitons and vortex necklaces @xcite , stable solitons and localized vortices in attractive becs trapped in periodic potentials @xcite , matter - wave gap vortices @xcite , 2d bright solitons in dipolar becs @xcite , and so on .    from the theoretical standpoint ,",
    "the dynamics of such higher - dimensional structures is , generally , difficult to be treated analytically , especially so in time - dependent settings .",
    "this , in turn , raises important questions concerning their `` controllability '' , which would be of particular relevance regarding potential applications .",
    "ideally , such a controllability would allow `` manipulation '' of the condensates at will , e.g. , sustaining condensates which may expand towards complete dispersion , contract towards a complete collapse , or perform stable breathing oscillations .",
    "moreover , such processes could involve a targeted growth of a condensate up to a certain width or shrinkage down a desired size .",
    "our purpose in the present work is to illustrate how one can achieve this goal , by taking advantage of one of the few analytically tractable tools in higher - dimensional condensates , namely of the analysis of their moments @xcite ( see also references therein ) . in particular , we focus on the case of quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) , so - called , pancake - shaped condensates @xcite , under the effect of time - varying harmonic trapping @xcite and also time - dependent s - wave scattering length ( which controls the inter - particle interactions ) . note that the controllability over the harmonic trapping is straightforwardly realizable under ac - variation of the atom trapping frequencies , while the controllabity over the interatomic interactions can be realized by using the so - called feshbach resonance @xcite , connecting the s - wave scattering length to external magnetic fields .",
    "this latter technique ( which is usually called feshbach resonance management ( frm ) ) has been proposed theoretically as a means of avoiding collapse @xcite , but also as a way of producing robust coherent nonlinear matter - waves @xcite .    for the quasi-2d condensates discussed above , upon presenting the moment analysis",
    ", we obtain a reduced dynamical description effectively involving only a variable associated with the width of the condensate wavefunction . this ordinary differential equation ( ode )",
    "can be reduced to one of the ermakov - pinney ( ep ) type @xcite , whose solutions can be obtained _ analytically _ , provided that the solutions of the underlying linear schrdinger equation can be obtained .",
    "we use this feature and the freedom in selecting the time - dependent trapping and interactions of the condensates to illustrate that one can construct analytical solutions to this ode that completely characterize the temporal evolution of the width of the wavefunction . in so doing ,",
    "we fully prescribe the dynamical evolution of the condensate .",
    "we show three prototypical examples in applying this idea : one in which the width grows in time ( leading to condensate expansion ) , one in which it decreases ( leading to focusing ) , and one in which it periodically `` breathes '' between a minimum and a maximum value . in all three cases , we test the analytical prediction against the full numerical simulation of the mean - field partial differential equation ( pde ) model fully describing the condensate .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the two , showcasing the accuracy of our theoretical approach .",
    "the analysis of the ensuing ep equation in this setting is of interest in its own right .",
    "this is because , as we will see , the resulting ep equation has a time - dependent nonlinearity in the right hand side ( contrary to what is the case for the `` standard '' ep framework ; see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in this context , and as an aside , we present a second physically relevant example where such ep equations with time - dependent nonlinearities may arise , by studying anisotropic scalar field cosmologies of a particular anisotropic geometry .",
    "this generalizes the example of @xcite parallelizing becs without frm and scalar field cosmologies in the isotropic case .",
    "our presentation will be structured as follows : in section iii , we provide a brief synopsis of the main features of the ep equation . in section iv",
    ", we proceed to an overview of the moment analysis , following the earlier works @xcite . in section iv",
    ", we present the analytical solutions of the ep equation that we develop for each of the above - mentioned three cases .",
    "section v tests these analytical results against full simulations of the pde describing the condensate .",
    "section vi illustrates the second example of time - dependent ep equations in the description of anisotropic scalar field cosmologies . finally ,",
    "in section vii , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "the ermakov - pinney ( ep ) equation is a remarkable nonlinear ode of the form : @xmath0 the particularly attractive feature of this nonlinear ode is that its general solution can be obtained , provided that one is able to solve the time - independent linear schrdinger ( ls ) equation @xmath1 . for details on the properties of the ep equation ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite and references therein .",
    "here we just mention its basic superposition principle property .",
    "namely , if the linearly independent solutions of the ls equation are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , then the most general possible solution of the ep equation is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants connected through @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the wronskian of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "one of the interesting variants of the `` regular '' ep equation of the form ( [ oeq0 ] ) arises in the study of becs , albeit in a somewhat modified form ( see below ) .    the relevant mean - field model for studying atomic bose - einstein condensates at zero temperature consists of the so - called gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite of the following dimensionless form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the wavefunction of the condensate , @xmath11 denotes the harmonic trap confining the bosons [ with a time - dependent frequency determined by @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the coefficient of the nonlinear term proportional to the s - wave scattering length , characterizing the interaction between the particles .",
    "we will take advantage of the feshbach resonance @xcite to consider that the latter is time - dependent , as well .",
    "one of the popular approaches to studying eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is through the use of moment methods @xcite .",
    "the latter allow us to write odes for the moments of the mean - field wavefunction @xmath10 as follows .",

    "@xmath15 denotes complex conjugate and @xmath16 indexes the dimension ( similarly to @xcite ) .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) that : @xmath19 however , as derived in @xcite , @xmath20 we focus on @xmath21 , since this moment is associated with the width of the spatial profile of the wavefunction . from the latter , we can infer a number of useful pieces of information concerning certain asymptotic values ; in particular , if @xmath22 , the condensate collapses , while if @xmath23 , the bec disperses .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath24 norm of the wavefunction is conserved , the estimate of @xmath21 on the ( square ) width of the wavefunction can be used together with this conservation law to provide information on the amplitude @xmath25 of the wavefunction ( i.e. , approximately @xmath26 ) .    combining the two equations ( [ deriv ] ) and ( [ virial ] ) , we obtain a single equation for the time - dependence of @xmath21 as @xmath27 \\label{three}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    following @xcite",
    ", we consider a quadratic phase for the solution ( an assumption most relevant to dimension @xmath28 as discussed in @xcite , but which we will also consider more generally ) , and obtain ( cf .",

    "notice that this is the _ only _ assumption in our calculations herein , whose validity will be examined a posteriori by comparing our analytical results with numerical computations .    denoting for simplicity @xmath31 , the resulting ordinary differential equation for @xmath32",
    "can be written as : @xmath33    clearly , from the above exposition , the most straightforward case is the one with @xmath28 , on which we will focus next .",
    "when @xmath28 , the equation can be directly integrated , yielding @xmath34 where @xmath6 is an integration constant that can be computed from the initial conditions as : @xmath35    if we now use the transformation @xmath36 @xcite , then we obtain an ermakov - pinney ( ep ) type equation of the form : @xmath37 hence , eq .",
    "( [ ode3 ] ) is the equation that describes the dynamics of two - dimensional bose - einstein condensates in the presence of a time - dependent trap @xcite , as well as in the scenario of feshbach resonance management @xcite .",
    "one can now examine particular cases of time - dependence of @xmath38 and @xmath13 , using the analytical tractability of the ensuing ep equation , in order to obtain completely analytical solutions for @xmath39 , and hence for @xmath40 .",
    "there are numerous possiblities in the case of a time - dependent @xmath41 and @xmath42 , thus , as explained above , we limited our investigation to the three cases of an expanding waveform , a collapsing waveform and an oscillatory waveform . in order to derive examples for each of these cases , @xmath13 was chosen to be independent of the choice of @xmath38 and @xmath43 .",
    "solutions to eqn .",
    "( [ ode3 ] ) were determined by `` reverse engineering '' @xcite ( based on the desired behavior of the dynamics of the wavefunction ) , and the details of the ep functional form .",
    "below are the three cases examined .",
    "notice that in all three cases , the function @xmath44 used below is given by @xmath45 i.e. , by the numerator of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ode3 ] ) .    1 .",
    "the first case explores the possibility of an expanding width wavefunction . in order for the wavefunction width to increase",
    ", @xmath38 must be decreasing , thus test functions for @xmath38 and @xmath43 were chosen to reflect this .",
    "a similar methodology was also used in the two other cases to determine test functions .",
    "@xmath46 2 .   the second case , a focusing wavefunction , required an additional condition ( @xmath47 ) in order to perform the numerical simulations described below .",
    "additionally , in this case and the next , an initially undetermined function @xmath48 was used in @xmath38 to simplify the derivation of @xmath38 and @xmath43 .",
    "after these were found , the exact form of @xmath48 was calculated by plugging @xmath38 and @xmath43 into eqn .",
    "( [ ode3 ] ) and solving for @xmath48 .",

    "[ figlambda ] .",
    "we note in passing that such schemes are definitely realizable within the unprecedented control that exists over the magnetic confinement of the condensates . a very recent example illustrating",
    "this point can be found in the recent work of @xcite ; this experiment clearly realizes a form of the third type of confinement ( an oscillatory one ) , by using a periodic modulation of the transverse confinement of the condensate , in order to induce longitudinal oscillations and the emergence of faraday patterns .",
    "this directly shows that temporal modulation of the trapping frequencies is feasible .",
    "what we propose here consists of the three principal types of trapping frequency dependence , i.e. , monotonic decrease , monotonic increase and oscillatory dependence , that allow an explicit analytical handle on the dynamics of the bec , in excellent agreement with our numerical findings ( see below ) .",

    "the temporal integration was implemented using a 4th - order runga - kutta scheme .",
    "it is worth noting here that in all three cases examined , the choice of @xmath13 was independent of the equations for @xmath38 and @xmath43 , thus @xmath57 was chosen to be used for all cases , in consonance with the feshbach resonance management scheme discussed in the introduction ; in that sense , however , notice that the key temporal variation in the schemes presented herein is that of the magnetic trapping frequency .",
    "as an initial condition to eqn .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we used a generic gaussian profile of the form @xmath58 with the values of @xmath25 and @xmath59 subject to the condition @xmath60 .    for the cases of the expanding and collapsing width wavefunctions",

    "an interesting analogy has been recently made between bose - einstein condensates and isotropic scalar field cosmologies in the absence of time dependence in the coefficient of the nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the so - called friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , coupled to a scalar field had been shown earlier @xcite to be described by an ep equation and that viewpoint was exploited in @xcite to illustrate an analogy between cosmic dynamics and becs .    here , we extend this analogy to ep equations with time - dependent nonlinearities .",

    "this may , in turn , provide valuable insights in the solution of such time - dependent ep equations ; this would be an interesting direction for future studies in such time - dependent ep settings .",
    "we close this section by noting that one can therefore generalize the analogy of bose condensates and scalar field cosmologies in the feshbach - managed viz .",
    "anisotropic case of the ep equation with time - dependent nonlinearity .",
    "the quantities that now bear the analogy is the scale factor of bianchi type i with the second moment of the condensate wavefunction , the time - dependent magnetic trap strength with the time - dependent scalar field and finally the time dependent nonlinearity coefficient ( i.e. , the scattering length in the condensate dynamics ) is ( indirectly ) connected with the reparametrization of time in the cosmological problem .",

    "can be obtained analytically and is found to be in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations of the full original pde model .",
    "the approach permits a detailed analytical handle on the behavior of higher dimensional condensates which is usually quite difficult to acquire with different methods based on nonlinear pdes .",
    "it may also , in turn , permit to appropriately craft experiments , based on the reshaping `` operation '' that is desirable to perform on the condensate .    as an aside example",
    ", we have illustrated the relevance of such time - dependent ermakov - pinney equations in a completely different physical system , namely in anisotropic scalar field cosmologies of bianchi type i.    this approach also suggests a number of interesting questions .",
    "it would be , in particular , relevant to examine whether a general solution of the time - dependent ep equation developed herein can be obtained on the basis of its linear schrdinger counterpart . this would bear direct consequences both in the atomic physics and in the cosmological problem , allowing for a general analytical description of their respective time - dependent properties ( for the condensate wavefunction width or the cosmological scale factor , respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , the approach was presented here for two - dimensional settings for reasons that have to do with the simplification / closure of the moment approach in that case .",
    "however , it would be of particular interest to develop similar approaches and potential closure schemes for one - dimensional or three - dimensional settings .",
