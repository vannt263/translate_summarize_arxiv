    "the photo- and electro - production of kaons on the proton in the resonance region have been studied both experimentally and theoretically since the 1960s .",
    "many data were collected on the kaon photo - production ( cornell , cal tech , bonn , tokyo , desy , and orsay , see @xcite ) but only a few experiments were carried - out on the electro - production ( harvard - cornell , desy , and cambridge , see @xcite and references therein ) . simulated by the availability of new facilities with higher current or / and high duty factor and polarization capability ( jlab , bonn , grenoble ) , more precise data on both reactions have been accumulated starting in the late of 1990s which renewed interest in the subject .",
    "now various response functions are accessible and measured with a good level of precision .",
    "the latest experimental data , especially those from jlab @xcite on the separated cross sections in the electro - production in the kinematic region where scarce data were formerly available , allow to perform more rigorous tests of theoretical models and in this way improve our understanding of the elementary process .",
    "numerous theoretical attempts have been made to describe the electro - magnetic production of kaons with @xmath2 in the final state . in the kinematic region , @xmath3 gev ,",
    "the isobaric models @xcite are of particular interest . in these models",
    "the amplitude is derived from an effective hadronic lagrangian using the feynman diagram technique in the tree level approximation .",
    "however , it has been shown that the new data on @xmath4   @xcite can be equally well described by the regge model @xcite which is based on the idea of exchanges of families of the particles with particular quantum numbers in the t - channel .",
    "the regge model was aimed mainly for higher energies ( @xmath5 gev ) and small angles .",
    "however , the model was successfully applied to description of the electro - production data at the centre of mass energy @xmath6 gev @xcite .    in the isobaric models the invariant amplitude gains contributions from the extended born diagrams , in which the proton , @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and kaon are exchanged in the intermediate state , and the resonant diagrams which include exchanges of moderate mass ( less than 2 gev ) nucleon , hyperon , and kaon resonances .",
    "unfortunately , due to absence of a dominant exchanged baryon resonance in the process @xcite , in contrast with the pion and eta production , many of exchanged resonances have to be _ a priori _ assumed to contribute @xcite introducing a rather large number of free parameters in calculations , the appropriate coupling constants .",
    "the free parameters are determined by fitting the cross sections and polarizations to the experimental data which , however , provides a copious number of possible sets of parameters @xcite .",
    "this large number of models which describe the data equally well can be reduced implementing duality hypothesis , crossing symmetry , and su(3 ) symmetry constrains .",
    "according to duality principle most of the nucleon resonances exchanged in the s - channel , especially those with a high spin , can be mimic by the lowest - mass kaon poles k@xmath8 and k@xmath9 in the t - channel @xcite .",
    "the crossing symmetry constraint requires that a realistic model must yield simultaneously a reasonable description of the radiative capture of k@xmath10 on the proton with the lambda in the final state , which is related to the @xmath11  via the crossing symmetry @xcite .",
    "the flavor su(3 ) symmetry allows to relate the main coupling constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 to the better established one , @xmath14 . for the 20% breaking of the su(3 ) symmetry the following limits can be obtained : @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "analysis of data performed under different assumptions about duality , crossing and su(3 ) symmetry @xcite showed that a moderate number of resonances is sufficient to get a reasonable agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the models discussed above assume point - like particles in the hadron vertexes to ensure the gauge invariance principle .",
    "recently haberzettl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced hadron form factors in the gauge - invariant way in an isobaric model which required addition of a contact term to compensate the gauge - violating part of the amplitude .",
    "the method was worked out recently by davidson and workman @xcite and further used by janssen _",
    "taking into account the hadron form factors led to reducing of divergences at higher energies inherent to most of isobaric models and also to more realistic predictions for the isospin - symmetry related @xmath17 channel @xcite .",
    "another simplification assumed by the models is neglecting a meson - baryon re - scattering in the final state which obviously leads to violation of unitarity .",
    "interaction of hadrons in the final state was taking into account for the photo - production reaction by feuster and mosel @xcite employing the k - matrix approximation . enforcing unitarity dynamically",
    "was performed by chiang _",
    "_ @xcite who utilised the coupled - channel approach . in their analysis",
    "they concluded that inclusion of the @xmath18n system in the intermediate state is needed for a proper description of the @xmath11  reaction .",
    "more elementary approaches to study the reaction mechanism of @xmath11  was performed in terms of quark degrees of freedom in refs .",
    "these models being in a closer connection with qcd than those based on the hadron degrees of freedom , need a smaller number of parameters to describe the data . moreover",
    ", the quark models assume explicitly an extended structure of the hadrons which was found to be important for a reasonable description of the photo - production data @xcite . other approach to the @xmath11  reaction based on the chiral perturbation theory @xcite",
    "is applicable to the threshold region only .",
    "this paper is aimed to discuss existing isobaric and regge models for the electro - magnetic production of k@xmath19 off the proton particularly in view of the new experimental data @xcite .",
    "we intend to pick up among the models those reliable in the kinematic region of the e98 - 108 experiment @xcite for further comparison with the coming data .",
    "the experiment e98 - 108 which was carried out in hall a at jefferson lab in 2001 and 2002 extends the present data on the separated cross sections of the @xmath4  reaction to higher energies and larger @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) providing very good quality data and consequently it can set stringent constraints on the models . in the next section we briefly outline the models . in the section 3",
    "we discuss predictions of the models in comparison with the new data .",
    "in comparison performed here we adopted a set of isobaric models , which are sufficiently well described in literature to enable performing calculations , and the regge model .",
    "we also adopted results of the model by bennhold _",
    "_ utilising the `` new isobar model ( dec 2000 ) '' interactive code at the kaon - maid web - page @xcite .",
    "those , trivial , isobaric models which assume only the born terms ( ab1 @xcite and aw1 @xcite ) were omitted from the analysis .",
    "the isobaric models selected for the comparison can be grouped according to the reaction they were determined for : +  1 .",
    "photo - production only : ab2 @xcite , aw2 @xcite , as1 , as2 @xcite , w1 and w2 @xcite .",
    "electro - production only : aw3 @xcite .",
    "photo- and electro - production : aw4 @xcite , c3 @xcite , c4(wjc ) @xcite , sl @xcite and sla @xcite .",
    "the models in the first group have to be extended for @xmath4   assuming a particular prescription for the electro - magnetic form factors of the mesons and baryons .",
    "results of these models for the electro - production , therefore , depends to some extent on an ansatz we made for the electro - magnetic form factors and in this limited sense the models are predictive . in this analysis we used phenomenological prescriptions @xcite fixed by the electron scattering .",
    "the meson form factors were supposed to be of the monopole form with @xmath22 gev for all mesons whereas the dipole form , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 gev , was used for all baryons .",
    "unfortunately , there are several models , aw3 , aw4 , c3 , and c4 , which were not sufficiently well commented in the original paper and for which either a definition or a form of the electro - magnetic form factors is not clear . in that cases we tried several possibilities to introduce the form factors .",
    "finally we have chosen those which provide the best agreement with original results .",
    "that is why in the case of aw3 and aw4 models we employ the phenomenological prescriptions as used in ref .",
    "@xcite and discussed above . in the case of the williams - ji - cotanch models , c3 and c4 ( wjc ) , we find it interesting to compare the original prescription in which the electric ( @xmath25 ) and magnetic ( @xmath26 ) form factors are used in the electro - magnetic vertexes , we denote it as c3_4 and c4_4 hereafter , with the definition commonly used @xcite in which dirac ( @xmath27 ) and pauli ( @xmath28 ) form factors are substituted in a gauge - invariant way @xcite , we denote it as c3_2 and c4_2 . in both cases",
    "the gari and krumpelmann prescription , the extended vector meson dominance model @xcite , was utilised for the baryon form factors and the vector meson dominance model as discussed by williams _",

    "values of the parameters can be directly compared since they are properly normalised according to definition of vertexes and units used here .",
    "since the observable quantities are bilinear forms of the cgln amplitudes which are linear in the strong coupling constants in the tree level approximation the whole set of the constants may be multiplied by an arbitrary global phase , e.g. -1 . in this way",
