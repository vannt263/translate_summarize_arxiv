    "sensitive and high angular resolution observations at 7 mm revealed a compact , possibly isolated disk associated with iras 16293@xmath52422b with a gaussian half - power radius of only 8 au @xcite .",
    "however , the search for an outflow associated with this source has been a hard task .",
    "@xcite using submillimeter ( sma ) observations of iras 16293@xmath52422 with a relatively high angular resolution resolved the a and b components , and did not find any strong indications for high velocity gas toward b. @xcite reported the detection of a compact blue - shifted co structure to the south - east of source b , and mentioned that it might correspond to a compact outflow ejected from source b. loinard et al .",
    "( 2012 ) using alma observations revealed indeed that the source b is driving a south - east blueshifted compact outflow .",
    "however , the flow has peculiar properties : it is highly asymmetric , bubble - like , fairly slow ( 10 km s@xmath7 ) , and lacking of a jet - like feature along its symmetry axis . in addition , its dynamical age is only about 200 years .",
    "one of the first evidences of the detection of infall motions associated with iras 16293@xmath52422b came from @xcite using submillimeter array ( sma ) observations at 300 ghz .",
    "more recently , @xcite using alma science verification observations with high - spectral resolution studied the gas kinematics with detail in iras 16293@xmath52422b at 220 ghz , and reported clear inverse p - cygni profiles toward this source in their three brightest lines and derived from a simple two - layer model an infall rate of 4.5 @xmath8 10@xmath9 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 , which is a typical value for low - mass protostars .    in this _",

    "the continuum observations reveal a very compact source with a deconvolved angular size of about 400 _ milli - arcseconds _ or a spatial size of about 50 au , while the line emission shows a clear pronounced inner depression or `` hole '' in the middle of iras 16293@xmath52422b .",
    "all the three lines mapped in this study show pronounced inverse p - cygni profiles .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the observations were made with fifteen antennas of alma on april 2012 , during the alma science verification data program .",
    "the array at that point only included antennas with diameters of 12 meters .",
    "the 105 independent baselines ranged in projected length from 26 to 403 m. the observations were made in mosaicing mode using a half - power point spacing between field centers and thus covering both sources iras 16293@xmath52422a and b. however , in this study we will focus only on the molecular and continuum emission arising from iras 16293@xmath52422b .",
    "the primary beam of alma at 690 ghz has a fwhm of @xmath10 arcsec .",
    "the alma digital correlator was configured in 4 spectral windows of 1875 mhz and 3840 channels each .",
    "this provides a channel width of 0.488 mhz ( @xmath0 0.2 km s@xmath7 ) , but the spectral resolution is a factor of two lower ( 0.4 km / s ) due to online hanning smoothing .",
    "observations of juno provided the absolute scale for the flux density calibration while observations of the quasars j1625@xmath5254 and nrao530 ( with flux densities of 0.4 and 0.6 jy , respectively ) provided the gain phase calibration .",
    "the quasars 3c279 and j1924 - 292 were used for the bandpass calibration .",
    "the data were calibrated , imaged , and analyzed using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) . to analyze the data , we also used the karma software @xcite . the resulting r.m.s .",

    "many more spectral lines from different molecular species were found across the entire spectral bandwidth , however , this study will concentrate on the analysis of the continuum emission and the lines presented in table 1 that are associated with iras 16293@xmath52422b .",

    "it is clearly observed in all lines , that the molecular emission surrounds the continuum emission and has a strong central depression or `` hole '' in the middle .",
    "the peak of the continuum shows a small offset to the west with respect to the central position of the `` hole '' .",
    "this small deviation might be explained by opacity effects of the dust emission at these wavelengths .",

    "this size is quite large ( a factor of about six ) compared to that found at 7 mm by @xcite .",
    "this difference in apparent angular sizes is most probably the result of the increasing optical depth with frequency of the dust .",
    "moreover , inside of the 50 au diameter , the source b does not show any more inner structure even when our beam size is about half of the source s size at these wavelengths .",

    "the spectrum from all lines were obtained averaging in an area ( box ) similar to the size of the molecular ring like structure ( @xmath0 1.0@xmath31 ) .",
    "the spectrum of all lines is found to be well centered at an lsr velocity of @xmath323 km s@xmath7 , which is approximately the systemic velocity for this source @xcite .",
    "all three lines also show marked inverse p - cygni profiles but with that of the ch@xmath33oh showing the more pronounced absorption feature .",
    "this is probably due to this line frequently being more optically thick .",
    "the h@xmath1cn and hc@xmath2n show line profiles very similar with the emission components being stronger compared with the ch@xmath33oh spectra , see figure 1 .",
    "this latter line mostly shows two faint condensations surrounding the continuum source and does not present a marked ring like structure as compared with the rest of the lines .",
    "the morphology of the line emission in general forms a well defined ring like structure around the continuum .",
    "however , the ring like structure is not completely closed , there is a small cavity towards its southeast .",
    "this cavity is probably created by the southeast monopolar outflow reported by loinard et al .",
    "the molecular ring like structure has a diameter of 850 @xmath15 50 _ milli - arcseconds _ and an inner diameter of 300 @xmath15 50 _ milli - arcseconds _ , which is comparable to the deconvolved size of the 0.45 mm continuum source ( about 400 _ milli - arcseconds _ ) .",
    "in figure 3 , we show the integrated intensity of the weighted velocity ( moment 1 ) color map of the h@xmath1cn .",
    "this figure reveals a clear east - west velocity gradient of approximately 1.3 km s@xmath7 over 60 au .",
    "this small gradient might suggest that the orientation of the disk plane is very close to the plane of the sky .",
    "if we assume that the rotation is keplerian and attribute it to a disk in rotation then the dynamical mass associated to this velocity gradient corresponds to only 0.1 m@xmath6 , which is indeed very small and is comparable with the dust disk mass .",
    "however , if we correct by the inclination angle dividing this mass by the @xmath34 with @xmath35 say 5@xmath36 , we obtain a value of 1.2 m@xmath6 , a more reasonable value for the central object and the disk associated with a solar type young star , see @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the disk plane of iras16293@xmath52422b must be located almost on the plane of the sky , as already suggested by @xcite .      in figure 4",
    ", we show the result of the modeled spectra that we made in this study .",
    "we fitted the spectral profile using a modified two - layer model ( myers et al .",
    "1996 ; di francesco et al 2001 ; kristensen et al .",
    "2012 ) , as described by pineda et al .",
    "this model consists of two layers of gas , front and rear , that are infalling towards the central source with an infall velocity , velocity dispersion , excitation temperature , and opacity at the center of the line of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively . in between the two layers",
    "there is an optically thick continuum source emitting as a blackbody of temperature @xmath41 , and filling a fraction of the beam , @xmath42 .",
    "the background temperature that illuminates the rear layer is taken to be the cosmic background , @xmath43 = 3 k.    the brightness temperature of the optically thick continuum source is taken to be such that it matches the peak continuum flux density of the image , @xmath41 = 160 k. the adopted filling fraction of the continuum source , @xmath42 = 0.37 is consistent with the ratio of solid angles between the region in absorption to the region in emission . from the fits of pineda",
    "et al . ( 2012 ) to lines at lower frequencies ( 220 ghz ) they estimate @xmath39 = 40 k. the lines sampled by us are probably originating in gas closer to the star ( see below ) . assuming that the excitation temperature of the molecules decreases as the square root of the distance and that the gas sampled by pineda et al .",
    "( 2012 ) is 50% more distant than that sampled by us , we adopt @xmath39 = 50 k. the fitting was minimized with a grid search , obtaining the following parameters : @xmath37 = 0.7 km s@xmath7 , @xmath38 = 0.6 km s@xmath7 , and @xmath40 = 0.17 .",
    "finally , the systemic velocity obtained from the fit was @xmath44 = 3.0 km s@xmath7 .",
    "several of the parameters are quite similar to those derived by pineda et al .",
    "( 2012 ) from lines at 220 ghz .",
    "however , others are not and we discuss them here .",
    "first , the brightness temperature of the optically thick continuum source is 20 k in the case of pineda et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and 160 k in this paper .",
    "this is as expected since the optical depth of dust increases sharply with frequency .",
    "the large brightness temperature derived by us and consistent with our profile modeling implies that at 690 ghz we are observing a truly optically - thick disk since the brightness temperature is comparable with the thermodynamic temperatures expected in the inner parts of a yso accretion disk .",
    "the optical depth used by us is about one half of that used by pineda et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . finally , the infall velocity and velocity dispersion required by our modeling ( 0.7 and 0.6 km s@xmath7 , respectively ) are larger than those used by pineda et al .",
    "( about 0.5 and 0.3 km s@xmath7 , respectively ) , implying that we may be detecting faster , more turbulent gas located closer to the central object .",
    "this is consistent with the standard picture of infall , where higher velocities occur at smaller radii .",
    "the velocities reported here are supersoinic as those reported in pineda et al .",
    "in this paper , we have reported line and continuum observations obtained with alma at 690 ghz with a very high angular resolution ( @xmath0 0.2 arcsec ) of iras 16293 - 2422b .",
    "the main conclusions are as follows :    * the 0.45 mm continuum emission revealed a very compact object with a deconvolved angular size of about 400 _ milli - arcseconds _ that is associated with iras 16293 - 2422b .",
    "this size is very large compared to the one reported at 7 mm ( about 8 au ) and does not show any structure inside of this diameter ( or a flat structure ) .",
    "* the h@xmath1cn , hc@xmath2n , and ch@xmath3oh images revealed a pronounced inner depression or `` hole '' with a size comparable to that estimated for the submillimeter continuum . * we suggest that the presence of this inner depression with an angular size comparable with that of the continuum source and the fact that we do not see inner structure in the continuum is produced by very optically thick dust located in the innermost parts of iras 16293 - 2422b . *",
    "all three lines also show inverse p - cygni profiles with infall and dispersion velocities larger than those recently reported at smaller wavelengths , suggesting that we are revealing faster , and more turbulent gas located closer to the central object .",
    "* we report a small east - west velocity gradient in iras 16293 - 2422b observed in all lines that suggests that the disk plane of this object is likely located very close to the plane of the sky .",
