    "_ stellar - mass black holes ( sbhs ) : _ astrophysical black holes ( bhs ) come in a variety of masses and spins . sbh candidates with @xmath6 have been observed ( see , e.g. , table 1 in * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the masses of the bhs can be obtained through two main channels .",
    "the first of which is by collapse of the progenitor star and capture of fallback mass .",
    "the second channel is through mass transfer from a companion star .",
    "of course , other channels are possible ; e.g. , the bh could be the merger of two compact objects ( ns - ns , bh - ns , wd - wd , ns - wd , bh - wd , etc . ) , a compact object and a main sequence ( ms ) star or through a common - envelope phase ; the last two mechanisms could produce a thorne - ytkow objects ( to ) that eventually forms a bh @xcite .    besides the masses of sbhs it has also been possible to obtain their spins .",
    "these may reveal important features of the bhs history . some of these spins ( where @xmath7 is the angular momentum of the bh and @xmath8 is its mass ) and it varies between @xmath9 , for accretion disks which counterrotate with respect to the bh , to @xmath10 for nonspinning bhs , to @xmath11 for corrotating accretion disks .",
    "] have been estimated through three different methods and seem to be distributed between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "all these methods depend on observing phenomena of an accretion disk surrounding the sbh , thus a donor star is necessary .",
    "one method for measuring sbh spins is by fitting the x - ray continuum .",
    "( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "a second method is through x - ray reflection spectroscopy ( of the fe k-@xmath14 line ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the third method that has been used is through quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) from the precession of the accretion disk ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "stellar - mass bhs may acquire their spins through a variety of mechanisms . in most bhs known in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , the spins may be the result of pre - bh formation processes , either by accretion through mass transfer @xcite , or through tidal - synchronization after a post - case - c - mass - transfer - and - common - envelope episode @xcite ; this mechanism may even lead to the production of gamma - ray burst and hypernova events ( e.g. , @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .    for the bhs in high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , the spin estimates seem to pile on the high end , i.e. , they vary between 0.84 and @xmath15 .",
    "stellar evolution in binaries has trouble explaining said spins and so do core - collapse mechanisms ( moreno mndez & cantiello , in progress ) , thus @xcite have suggested that wind - driven mass transfer with hypercritical accretion may be necessary to explain these binaries .    _ intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) : _ imbhs are the logical intermediary between sbhs and supermassive bhs ( smbhs ) .",
    "if the later are produced by accretion onto the former or from mergers of massive stars or sbhs , then imbhs should be abundant .",
    "on the other hand , if they are only produced from core - collapse of population iii stars , they may have already turned into smbhs .",
    "indeed , they are excellent candidates to explain the observed ultra luminous x - ray ( ulx ) sources . nonetheless , many ulxs have been identified with lmxbs @xcite and hmxbs @xcite",
    ". there seems to be , however , a good candidate of an imbh in a ulx where , using high - frequency qpos ( with 3:2 ratio ) , @xcite use inverse - scaling of sbh as well as a relativistic precession model to determine a mass of @xmath16 .",
    "_ super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) : _ explaining the mass of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) is one of the most interesting current problems of astrophysics .",
    "a standard approach to the problem assumes that these holes are the result of the accretion onto intermediate - mass black - hole ( imbh ) seeds .",
    "this raises the question of where such seeds come from in the first place .",
    "the answer to this question has opened a wide set of possibilities .",
    "it could be that disks formed in protogalaxies allow the infall of matter that collapses to form black holes of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , seeds of @xmath18 can be formed due to the runaway collision of compact stellar clusters in low metallicity protogalaxies at @xmath19 that additionally allow accretion during the quasar era @xcite .",
    "also , seeds can be the result of the core collapse of dense clusters and form @xmath20 black holes @xcite .",
    "another alternative is that seeds of @xmath20 can be formed due to the collapse of very massive stars @xcite at extremely low metallicity .",
    "a more detailed model in this direction proposes that a supermassive primordial star forms in a region of the universe with a high molecule - dissociating background - radiation field , and collapses directly into a @xmath21 black - hole seed @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been proposed that primordial black holes , during the radiation - dominated era , can grow up to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "based on the study of the evolution of phase space distributions , the growth process of seeds in standard analysis of smbhs considers that these are primarily fed by collisionless dark matter or stars @xcite .",
    "previous results show that the timescale is extremely long for collisionless dark matter to contribute significantly to black - hole growth ( for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in @xcite",
    "the conditions for stable accretion and runaway accretion of an ideal gas have been studied .",
    "other more generalized cases , consider non - radial accretion processes which require the particles to overcome the angular momentum barrier in order to get the gas to the center of a galaxy @xcite .    the assumption of self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) has been used to analyze the problem of smbh growth .",
    "for instance in @xcite and @xcite sidm is used to model direct dynamical collapse and smbh formation due to the gravothermal catastrophe .",
    "furthermore , this would explain the different smbh seed masses in terms of the redshift at which the collapse took place .",
    "show that fermionic dark matter can feed smbh seeds to make them grow up to @xmath23 . instead ,",
    "@xcite propose that the self - interaction is introduced using a polytropic equation of state for the pressure , thus , finding another mechanism for smbh formation .",
    "@xcite ( and later * ? ? ?",
    "* ) analyzed black hole formation due to the collapse of sidm and also studied smbh formation and growth due to the collapse and accretion of sidm .",
    "@xcite studied the accretion of a sidm into a smbh for the particular case of radial flows .",
    "they considered the evolution of space - time in order to have the formally correct black - hole growth rate .",
    "the characterization of smbh spin is of vital importance since it probes their growth history as well as their formation .",
    "in essence , scenarios in which smbh growth is dominated by bh - bh mergers predict a population of modestly spinning smbhs , whereas growth via gas accretion can lead to either , a rapidly - spinning , or a very slowly - spinning population @xcite .",
    "smbh spin can also be a potent energy source , and may well drive the powerful relativistic jets that are seen from many black hole systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "bondi - hoyle - lyttleton ( bhl ) accretion deals with the evolution of a homogeneously distributed gas moving uniformly toward a central compact object @xcite . depending on whether the velocity of the gas is supersonic ( or not ) a shock cone",
    "is formed ( or not ) .",
    "this process shows interesting properties when considered within the newtonian and relativistic regimes , which have been explored based on several numerical studies . in the classical regime , which is ruled by newtonian gravity , the most important subjects are the consequences on the morphology of the wind and the supersonic shocks that develop .",
    "a summary of results , under newtonian gravity , can be found in .    unlike in the newtonian regime",
    ", the relativistic approach allows the study of bhl accretion in regions where the gravitational field is strong .",
    "some studies in this direction have been carried out .",
    "the first one , performed by @xcite , studied the different accretion patterns developed by the relativistic gas during the accretion onto a bh . later on , considering axial and equatorial symmetries , @xcite reviewed the results obtained by @xcite using more accurate methods .",
    "in the astrophysical context and using equatorial symmetry , @xcite showed that the shock cone vibrations can be associated with sources of qpos .",
    "they also found a flip - flop type of unstable oscillation of the shock cone .",
    "however , it was later shown by @xcite that the flip - flop oscillation of the shock cone depends on the coordinates used to describe the rotating black hole , specifically , it was found that the flip - flop oscillation does not appear when kerr - schild coordinates are used to describe the rotating black hole .",
    "more recently , considering axially symmetric fluxes , in @xcite , the shock cone oscillations as a potential source of low and high frequency qpos were studied .",
    "the ultrarelativistic bhl accretion onto a rotating black hole was recently reported considering axisymmetric fluxes @xcite and considering equatorial symmetry @xcite .",
    "more realistic scenarios introduce astrophysically relevant ingredients like magnetic fields @xcite , radiative terms @xcite and full general relativity in the context of supermassive black hole binary mergers @xcite .",
    "this work uses penetrating coordinates ( kerr - schild ) , which offer the possibily to place the excision inside the event horizon of the bh .",
    "it is well known that what happens inside a bh , stays inside the bh , thus this further avoids the implementation of boundary conditions there .    in the newtonian regime ,",
    "the bhl problem is attended by assuming the accretor is point - like and the size of the accretor is determined in terms of the accretion radius . in our case",
    "we are doing the exact opposite ; this implies that if we want to resolve the accretor , i.e. the schwarzschild radius must be similar in order of magnitud to the accretion radius , thus , the velocity of the wind must be high .",
    "this is so that the ratio of the accretion radius ( as well as that of the compact object ) can be small enough as compared to the exterior numerical domain radius ( the ratio must be at least an order of magnitude ) so that no numerical artifacts affect the simulations @xcite .",
    "hence , this allows to have good resolution and a reasonable computational timescale .",
    "the accretion radius is defined to help decide when a particle falls into the compact object .",
    "such a scale is determined by the velocity of the wind and the equation of state of the gas . in our case",
    "we use the accretion radius only to choose the exterior numerical domain , that is about ten times the accretion radius .",
    "another problem one may face is that the relativistic euler equations may diverge or develop unphysical results ; thus an atmosphere is implemented which prevents the rest mass density to be small enough such as to provoke said effects .",
    "the atmosphere we use is @xmath24 ; such a value allows the convergence of our numerical methods .",
    "the need of the atmosphere is in fact one of the reasons why it is not -at the moment- trivial to simulate the evolution of fluids with ultralow density .",
    "given these numerical limitations , the maximum density difference between the bh .",
    "in this paper we are working under the assumption that the space - time background is unaffected by the fluid contribution , i.e. , we have a test fluid , which is consistent with our astrophysical models . ] and the non - homogeneous wind is of order @xmath25 . also , the velocities in our models will be restricted to values between 0.1@xmath26 and 0.5@xmath26 .",
    "this minimizes the possible scope of astrophysical scenarios that can be dealt with .      in this manuscript",
    "we present for the first time a numerical model of relativistic bhl accretion onto a kerr bh of a non - homogeneous gas cloud .",
    "this problem was addressed initially , in the newtonian regime , by and .",
    "they investigated the hydrodynamics of three - dimensional classical bhl accretion ; especially the accretion of angular momentum from a non - homogeneous medium and discussed some consequences for models of wind - fed x - ray sources .",
    "they found that the models with a density gradient exhibit non - stationary flow patterns , even though the mach cone remains fairly stable . in more recent work , also in the newtonian regime , @xcite model the orbital inspiral of a neutron star ( ns ) through the envelope of its giant - branch companion during a common envelope ( ce ) episode .",
    "they found that the presence of a density gradient strongly limits the accretion by imposing a net angular momentum to the flow around the ns .",
    "based on the limitations stated above , we accordingly list which models are appropriate for our different simulations which have been left unitless in order to maximize the posible scenarios in which they would be useful .",
    "hence , in what follows , the mass of the bh shall be denoted @xmath27 . following the usual convention",
    ", we shall mostly use units in which @xmath28 .",
    "thus , length and time are measured in units of @xmath27 with @xmath29 cm @xmath30 s.    this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : models ] proposes models for bhs of different masses .",
    "section  [ sec : equations ] describes the relativistic hydrodynamic equations as well as the numerical methods employed by our code .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows our numerical results . and in section  [ sec :",
    "conclusions ] we discuss them and produce our conclusions .",
    "we have produced a set of models which are bh mass independent , therefore , once the mass of the bh has been chosen , its density is established and one may obtain the wind density that hits the bh .",
    "the velocities of the flows hitting the bh are 0.1c , 0.2c , 0.3c , 0.4c and 0.5c .",
    "we next list a set of astrophysical situations where our model would become a good fit with the proper scaling .      _ relativistic winds and shockwaves : _ an astrophysical scenario where our models may apply for stellar - mass bhs is during a hypernova in a binary system .",
    "suppose we have a short - orbital - period binary ( @xmath31 day ) with a massive wr star ( @xmath32 ) and a @xmath33 bh ( e.g. , cyg x-3 may be a system in a situation similar to this description ) .",
    "the wr tidally synchronizes and rotates rapidly",
    ". such a star will collapse into a compact object and will likely launch a grb / hn explosion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath34 collapse , the resulting bh could have @xmath35 and the available energy would be @xmath36 erg ( or 1000 bethes ; 1 bethe @xmath37 b @xmath38 erg ) .",
    "if @xmath34 of material are expelled with a fraction ( say @xmath39 to @xmath40 of this energy ) their average velocity would be between @xmath41 and @xmath42 . at the time of the explosion , the orbital separation is about 3 @xmath43 to 4 @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the density of the ejecta at the orbit of the bh could be as large as one fifth of its density inside the star if the expansion is mostly equatorial or a hundredth if the expansion is spherically symmetric .",
    "this translates to densities as high as @xmath44 g @xmath45 if material from the c core is expelled . for a @xmath46 bh ,",
    "the density is @xmath47 g @xmath45 .",
    "thus our model deals with @xmath48 g @xmath45 , which is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude above what this model provides .",
    "hence , our simulations give a good qualitative description of what should occur for such a scenario .",
    "imbhs have a density range of @xmath49 g @xmath45 ( @xmath50 ) to @xmath51 g @xmath45 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "thus , given that our simulations are bound to @xmath53 , we have a wind density regime that goes from @xmath54 g @xmath45 to @xmath55 g @xmath45 .",
    "a scenario similar to the previous one would be ideal .",
    "i.e. , an imbh in the mass range of @xmath56 , located , e.g. , near the center of a globular cluster which were to tightly capture a massive wr star ( maybe through a common envelope phase ) . if the orbital period was , again , 0.4 days , the orbital separation , @xmath57 , would be @xmath58 , respectively . the wr radius being some 50 to 10% of its roche lobe ( rl ) radius ( the bh radius being less than about a thousandth of its rl radius ) .",
    "for such an orbital separation the density of the ejecta should be around @xmath59 g @xmath45 to @xmath60 g @xmath45 , at @xmath61 ; and @xmath60 g @xmath45 to @xmath62 g @xmath45 , at @xmath63 .",
    "thus , these models are well within the range of our numerical calculations .",
    "smbhs ( @xmath64 to @xmath65 ; although there is recent evidence for a smbh as large as @xmath66 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have a density range that goes from @xmath67 g @xmath45 to @xmath68 g @xmath45 .",
    "the wind densities in our numerical simulations are , hence , confined between @xmath55 g @xmath45 and @xmath69 g @xmath45 .    among the possible scenarios where",
    "our models may be applied for smbhs are , e.g. , a smbh binary where one of the bhs has relativistic jets pointing along the orbital plane . as the second bh steps into or out of the jet of the first bh , it is submerged in a stream of material with a density gradient .",
    "it is conceivable that the last model discussed for imbhs ( a nearby grb pointing towards the bh ) could similarly apply for smbhs but at somewhat larger distances .",
    "in order to solve numerically the relativistic euler equations , we use the 3 + 1 decomposition of space - time , in which the space - time is foliated with a set of non - intersecting space - like hypersurfaces @xmath70 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the space - time is described with the line element        the background space - time corresponds to a rotating black hole in kerr - schild coordinates , which allow us to place the inner boundary of the computational domain inside the event horizon .",
    "a discussion of the advantage on the use of these coordinates can be found in @xcite .",
    "once the geometrical elements of the space - time background are known , it is necessary to track the evolution of the fluid , for which we write down the general relativistic euler equations . for a generic space - time",
    "these can be derived from the local conservation of the stress - energy tensor          where @xmath76 is the proper rest mass density , @xmath77 is the four - velocity of the fluid and @xmath78 is the covariant derivative consistent with the four - metric @xmath79 of the space - time ( [ eq : lineelement ] ) .        where @xmath81 is the pressure , @xmath79 are the components of the four - metric and @xmath82 the relativistic specific enthalpy given by @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the rest frame specific internal energy density of the fluid .",
    "it is well known that euler s equations develop discontinuities in the hydrodynamical variables even if smooth initial data are considered .",
    "thus one may solve hydrodynamics equations using finite volume methods , as long as the system of equations is written in a flux balance law form , which in turn requires the definition of conservative variables .    in order to obtain the general relativistic euler equations as a set of flux balance laws @xcite , we project the local conservation equations along the space - like hypersurfaces and the normal direction to such hypersurfaces .",
    "a straightforward calculation yields the set of equations in the desired form      where @xmath86 is the determinant of the four - metric ( [ eq : lineelement ] ) , @xmath87 is a vector of conservative variables , @xmath88 are the fluxes along each spatial direction and @xmath89 is a source vector .",
    "these last quantities are given by :    @xmath90^t = [ \\rho \\gamma , ~~ \\rho h \\gamma^2 v_j ,   ~~ \\rho h \\gamma^2 -p - \\rho \\gamma ] ^t , \\\\",
