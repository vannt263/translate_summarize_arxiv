    "this strengthens the result @xmath58 of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which states that @xmath59 , the critical level for percolation of the ( one - sided ) level sets @xmath60 , @xmath61 , is finite for all @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , it follows from theorem 3.3 of @xcite that @xmath62 is strictly positive in large dimensions , see remark [ r : h_*positive ] , 2 ) below .",
    "it was already known from theorem 7 in @xcite ( see also p. 281",
    "therein ) that there is no directed percolation inside @xmath56 when @xmath57 is sufficiently large , for all @xmath63 . finally , let us mention that our results might be helpful for investigating certain random conductance models on @xmath0 , in the spirit of @xcite , with nearest - neighbor conductances involving the gaussian free field ; see also @xcite for further motivation .",
    "we now comment on the proofs . in order to establish the uniqueness result , cf .",
    "corollary [ c : uniqueness ] below , we invoke a classical theorem of burton and keane ( see for example @xcite , theorem 12.2 ) after showing in theorem [ t : fe ] that for all @xmath64 , the translation invariant law @xmath65 of @xmath66 under @xmath21 , see and lemma [ trans_inv ] , has the so - called finite energy property , i.e. @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , refer to the canonical coordinates on @xmath70 .",
    "this differs markedly from the case @xmath71 , since the law of random interlacement at any level @xmath72 fails to fulfill condition , see @xcite , remark 2.2 , 3 ) .",
    "the positivity of @xmath30 for @xmath73 in , cf .",
    "theorem [ t : alpha_*perc ] below , is shown as follows .",
    "first , we introduce new occupation variables on @xmath0 , whereby a site @xmath2 is `` occupied '' if and only if @xmath74 _ and _ the first - passage holding time at @xmath2 of the trajectory in the interlacement cloud with smallest label ( @xmath75 ) passing through @xmath2 exceeds @xmath13 ( see for a precise definition ) .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath76 whenever @xmath2 is `` occupied , '' hence @xmath65 dominates the ( joint ) law of these new occupation variables . loosely speaking",
    ", we then prove that , conditionally on @xmath14 , these new variables define an independent bernoulli percolation on the discrete interlacement set @xmath14 with a suitable success parameter @xmath77 satisfying @xmath78 .",
    "this enables us to use some recent results of @xcite to infer that the set of occupied vertices has an infinite cluster if @xmath77 is sufficiently close to 1 ( i.e. if @xmath13 is small enough ) .",
    "the proofs of the finiteness of @xmath30 and @xmath79 in and , see theorems [ t : alpha _ * ] and [ t : u _ * ] , respectively , both rely on the aforementioned isomorphism theorem ( see @xcite , theorem 0.1 ) , which states that @xmath80 we focus on the claim @xmath81 .",
    "the proof of is somewhat more involved , but has a similar flavor .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath17 for fixed @xmath3 , as @xmath13 becomes large . by ,",
    "@xmath65 ( the law of @xmath82 under @xmath21 ) is dominated by the law of @xmath83 under @xmath49 .",
    "hence , intuitively , if @xmath76 , then @xmath84 , i.e. @xmath85 has to be large ( since @xmath13 is ) .",
    "this heuristic reasoning suggests that the asserted finiteness of @xmath30 is in fact a corollary of .",
    "finally , the result concerning `` two - sided '' level - set percolation for the gaussian free field , see theorem [ t : gff_noperc ] below , is shown using some of the tools developed in @xcite for the analysis of ( one - sided ) level - set percolation ( i.e. percolation of the sets @xmath86 @xmath61 ; the corresponding critical parameter is denoted by @xmath59 , see ( 0.4 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it involves a renormalization scheme akin to the one introduced in section 2 of @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) , and crucially depends on the decoupling inequality ( proposition 2.2 in @xcite ; see also proposition [ p : dec_ineq ] below ) derived therein .",
    "however , we can not simply follow the strategy used to prove finiteness of @xmath87 in @xcite in order to establish , because the relevant crossing events @xmath88 , with @xmath89 , @xmath90 , which refer to the existence of a ( nearest - neighbor ) path in @xmath56 connecting @xmath91 , the closed ball of radius @xmath92 around the origin in the @xmath93-norm , to @xmath94 , the @xmath93-sphere of radius @xmath95 around @xmath24 , are neither increasing nor decreasing `` in @xmath96 , '' so proposition 2.2 of @xcite does not apply directly . to overcome this difficulty , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we partition @xmath0 into disjoint boxes of equal side length @xmath97 , for some @xmath98 , and call any such box @xmath57-_bad _ if @xmath99 for at least one site @xmath2 inside the box ( this is quite crude but suffices for our purpose ) .",
    "next , we consider the quantities @xmath100 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] for @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is a geometrically increasing sequence of length scales , see .",
    "we define @xmath103 similarly , with the last condition replaced by the requirement that @xmath104 for some site @xmath2 in the given box of side length @xmath97 . using the results of @xcite ,",
    "we show that @xmath105 for some careful choice of the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "together with a geometric argument in the spirit of lemma 6 in @xcite , see lemmas [ l : cramgen ] and [ l : cram ] below , this yields that large connected components of @xmath57-bad blocks have small probability .",
    "the claim then easily follows , since the existence of an infinite cluster in @xmath56 implies the existence of an infinite connected component of @xmath57-bad boxes .",
    "we conclude this introduction by describing the organization of this article . in section",
