    "lattice calculations @xcite and other models of qcd @xcite predict that the casimir scaling hypothesis is well verified in qcd , that is to say that the potential between two opposite colour charges in a colour singlet is proportional to the value of the quadratic casimir operator .",
    "this mechanism can be tested for instance in two - gluon glueballs .",
    "direct evidence for such a system is still controversial , but several models @xcite predict similar masses with values close to some of the experimental candidates @xcite . the casimir scaling hypothesis can also be tested in another system whose colour - spin structure is similar to the one of a glueball .",
    "let us consider an hybrid meson containing a colour octet spin one @xmath0 pair and a gluon .",
    "due their very heavy masses , the charm quarks can be assumed fixed at the centre of mass with the gluon orbiting around . a gluon attached to a heavy colour octet",
    "is called a gluelump , so the @xmath2 system considered here is called hybrid gluelump as in ref .  @xcite .    in our model , a quark and an antiquark",
    "are attached by a fundamental string while two gluons in a glueball are attached by an adjoint string .",
    "we assume here that the three - body nature of the confinement implies that the gluon and the colour octet pair are attached by two fundamental strings in a hybrid gluelump . within these hypothesis",
    ", we compute the masses of glueballs and hybrid gluelumps with a simple effective model of qcd @xcite .",
    "this semirelativistic potential model is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : ham ] .",
    "it depends on few parameters which are fixed on well known mesons in sec .",
    "[ sec : param ] .",
    "masses of glueballs and hybrid gluelumps are computed respectively in sec .",
    "[ sec : gg ] and [ sec : hyb ] .",
    "we focus our attention on the first orbital excitations , neglecting the details of the spin dependent interactions , assumed weak with respect to the confinement .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] .",
    "starting from the qcd theory , a lagrangian for a system of two confined spinless colour sources can be derived taking into account the dynamical degrees of freedom of the string , with tension @xmath3 , joining the two particles , the rotating string model ( rsm ) @xcite .",
    "this model is completely equivalent to the relativistic flux tube model @xcite , once the auxiliary fields appearing in the rsm are properly eliminated @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear coupled equations of these models are difficult to solve @xcite .",
    "so we will use an approximation of these effective qcd theories @xcite , which is simply given by the following spinless salpeter hamiltonian @xmath4 completed by a perturbative part due to the motion of the string @xmath5}{2 \\mu_1 \\mu_2",
    "\\left [ 12 \\mu_1 \\mu_2 + 4 ( \\mu_1 + \\mu_2 ) \\sigma r + ( \\sigma r)^2\\right]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath6 appearing in the above equation is a kind of constituent particle mass given by @xmath7 in which the average value is taken for an eigenstate of the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the constituent mass is then state - dependent .",
    "equation  ( [ hstr ] ) is obtained by taking the slow motion limit of eqs .",
    "( 33 ) in ref .",
    "the contribution @xmath8 to the mass due to the string can be computed with a good precision by the following approximation @xcite @xmath9}{2 \\mu_1 \\mu_2 \\left [ 12 \\mu_1 \\mu_2 + 4 ( \\mu_1 + \\mu_2 ) \\sigma \\langle r \\rangle   + ( \\sigma \\langle r \\rangle ) ^2 \\right]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth noting that , in this formalism , the particle masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the current ones .",
    "so , in the following , we will consider that the mass @xmath12 of the @xmath13 quark ( @xmath13 stands for @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) and the mass @xmath16 of the gluon are vanishing .    a significant contribution to hadron masses is also given by the one - gluon exchange ( oge ) mechanism between colour sources .",
    "at the zero order ( neglecting the spin ) , the interaction has the following form @xmath17 @xmath18 is a colour factor given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the colour casimir operator for the pair @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the corresponding one for the particle @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath24 is the solution of the eigenequation @xmath25 , the total mass @xmath26 for the system of the two colour sources is given by @xmath27 in this formula , the coulomb - like contribution is computed as a perturbation . it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that this approximation is very good , especially for states with high angular momentum @xmath28 .",
    "all computation are performed using the lagrange - mesh method @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that the quark self - energy ( qse ) contribution , which is created by the colour magnetic moment of the quark propagating through the vacuum background field , adds a negative constant to the hadron masses @xcite .",
    "its negative sign is due to the paramagnetic nature of the particular mechanism at work in this case .",
    "other contributions due to quark spin ( spin - spin , spin - orbit ) also exist but they are smaller that the qse one @xcite , and they are neglected in this work .",
    "the qse contribution @xmath29 for a quark of current mass @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 the @xmath32 function is such that @xmath33 , and its value decreases monotonically towards 0 with increasing quark mass @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 is the inverse of the gluonic correlation length , and its value is estimated about 1.0 - 1.3  gev . as the meson masses vary very little with this parameter @xcite , we fix the @xmath34 value at 1  gev ( meson masses do not depend on @xmath34 when @xmath35 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath36 has been computed by lattice calculations .",
    "first quenched calculations gave @xmath37 @xcite . a more recent unquenched work @xcite gives @xmath38 , the value that we choose in this work .",
    "if a hadron contains @xmath39 quarks , a contribution @xmath40 must be added to its mass .",
    "strong theoretical and phenomenological arguments indicate that gluons do not bring any contribution of self energy @xcite .",
    "as we are mainly interested in describing the main features of spectra , we can use a hamiltonian of spinless particles since spin effects are generally an order of magnitude smaller than orbital or radial excitations .",
    "moreover , we will consider hadrons for which the spin - dependent part of the hamiltonian is the weakest possible .",
    "the raise of degeneracy between spin 0 and spin 1 mesons can be due to a spin - spin potential coming from the oge or due to an instanton induced interaction @xcite . for spin 1 mesons ,",
    "the spin - dependent interaction is small in the former case or vanishing in the latter case .",
    "the spin - dependent part of the gluon - gluon interaction has a small contribution for glueballs with spin 2 @xcite . if we consider a hybrid gluelump containing a @xmath0 pair with spin 1 , we minimize the spin effect for the heavy quarks .",
    "as such a system is similar to a glueball from the point of view of the spin - colour structure , we can also expect that the spin contribution will be the smallest if we study spin 2 hybrids .",
    "for all these reasons , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will only consider systems with maximal value of the total spin @xmath41 : @xmath42 for mesons and @xmath43 for glueballs and hybrid gluelumps .",
    "a correct determination of the parameter is crucial to predict new states .",
    "for theoretical reasons , we have chosen to take @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath38 and @xmath46  gev .",
    "now , we will fix the values of the remaining free parameters with well established meson states . as , the light @xmath47 spin 1 mesons can be isoscalar ( @xmath48 ) or isovector ( @xmath49 )",
    ", we will use an average mass defined , as usual , by @xmath50    lrrrr @xmath51 , @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 + @xmath47 @xmath48 & 0.783 & 1.275 & 1.667 & 2.034 + @xmath47 @xmath49 & 0.775 & 1.318 & 1.689 & 2.001 + @xmath47 av .",

    "for such a system , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it can then be shown that @xmath62 with @xmath63 @xcite . using the semirelativistic virial theorem @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath64 . with the following approximation @xmath65",
    ", we obtain finally @xmath66 in which @xmath67 is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "let us note that an approximate value for @xmath68 is given by @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the solution of the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath71 in which @xmath72 and @xmath73 are conjugate variables .",
    "the accuracy of formula  ( [ mapprox ] ) with the approximation  ( [ nuapprox ] ) is about 5 - 10% @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the motion of the string to the meson mass is small , since the ratio @xmath74 is at most 1/16 @xcite .",
    "formula  ( [ mapprox ] ) shows that the contribution of the coulomb term and of the self energy shift the square mass @xmath75 of the meson without modifying the slope of the regge trajectories @xcite .",
    "this slopes depend mainly of the string tension which we call @xmath76 for a quark - antiquark bound state . with a fit ,",
    "it is only possible to determine the following combination of parameters @xmath77 .",
    "but since the value of @xmath36 is fixed , it is possible to compute @xmath78 .",
    "we fix the parameter by fitting the exact results of hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) on experimental data @xcite ( see table  [ tab : exp ] ) . using the regge trajectory for light meson",
    ", we find @xmath79  gev@xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the value obtained for @xmath78 is small with respect to values found in other potential models of meson .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a value of 0.39 is obtained because the meson masses are fitted on the centre of gravity of spin 1 and spin 0 mesons . in this case , the average mass of the @xmath58 @xmath47 state is 0.612   gev , a value quite different from the one we choose , 0.777  gev .",
    "the mass of the quark @xmath82 is determined by computing the masses of @xmath83 mesons , which are systems dynamically closer to hybrid gluelumps than charmonium states .",
    "all parameters are gathered in table  [ tab : param ] .",

    "the theoretical ( experimental ) binding energy for a meson is given by the theoretical ( experimental ) mass minus the theoretical current masses of the quark and the antiquark ( 0 for the light @xmath47 mesons , @xmath88 for the @xmath83 , @xmath89 for the charmoniums ) .",
    "quite good meson masses are obtained , taking into account the simplicity of the model ( see table  [ tab : m ] ) .",
    "the error is around 1% for light @xmath47 mesons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gg ] ) , around 3% for the @xmath83 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ccg ] ) ; around 10% for the mesons",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ccg ] ) , but less than 5% for radial excitations of the @xmath90 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cc ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we assume that the string tension between two colour sources is controlled by the casimir scaling .",
    "so , contrary to what is done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the ratio between the string tension in a glueball and the string tension in a meson is given by the ratio of the casimir operators . in a two gluon system , we have then @xmath92 , and the regge slope is increased by the same factor . moreover ,",
    "following the theory of simonov @xcite , there is no self - energy contribution coming from gluon .",
    "let us note that , in the same framework @xcite , the constituent mass of a particle is directly proportional to @xmath93 when its current mass @xmath94 is vanishing .",
    "if we compute @xmath95 from a two - gluon glueball and @xmath96 from a light meson , we have @xmath97 .",
    "a gluon can not decay spontaneously into a @xmath47 pair .    at the lowest order , the colour coulomb factor in such a system",
    "is given by the formula  ( [ kappa ] ) , that is to say @xmath98 .",
    "nevertheless , in some model , it is found that the coulomb force in glueballs could be damped @xcite or strongly reduced @xcite .",
    "so , we have considered both cases @xmath99 and @xmath98 to study this possible effect . as our value of @xmath78 is small",
    ", the two spectra do not differ strongly .",
    "the colour wave function of two gluons is symmetric and the spin wave function considered here is symmetric since @xmath100 . as gluons are bosons , the spatial wave function is also symmetric and @xmath28 is even .",
    "the first three states are computed with the six lowest light mesons of the first regge trajectory .",
    "results are given in table  [ tab : m ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : gg ] . when @xmath98 , the trajectory is @xmath101 when @xmath99 , the slope is not changed and the intercept becomes 0.57 .",
    "this results is somewhat different from the results of refs .",
    "@xcite because the smaller value of our string tension @xmath76 .",
    "but our glueball masses are compatible with those of the model iii.a of ref .",

    "with formula  ( [ kappa ] ) , we find @xmath103 for a gluon - quark pair inside the hybrid . as the quark and the antiquark are assumed to be very close , the total colour factor for the coulomb - like force between the gluon and the point - like @xmath0 pair is @xmath104 , which is the same as into a two gluon glueball . as in the previous case ,",
    "we have considered both @xmath99 and @xmath98 .",

    "the triangular inequalities imply @xmath112 .",
    "let us assume that the energy of these flux tubes are respectively @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , with @xmath116 .",
    "the total energy of the flux tubes is then @xmath117 . if @xmath118 , the above inequality shows that it is energetically favourable for the junction point @xmath108 to be on the source @xmath105 .",
    "the potential energy of the system is then @xmath119 . in the case of a hybrid gluelump ,",
    "the gluon is at position @xmath105 with @xmath120 and the quarks occupy positions @xmath106 and @xmath107 , which are merged here .",
    "so the confining energy is equal to two times the confining energy in a meson , and we take @xmath121 .    to compute the mass of the hybrid , we must fix the mass of the @xmath0 pair . in our model",
    ", there is no direct confining interaction between the quark and the antiquark , but a small repulsive coulomb force exists since formula  ( [ kappa ] ) implies that @xmath122 for a quark - antiquark pair in a colour octet .",
    "the @xmath82 and @xmath123 quarks does obviously not really occupy the same position . if we assume a typical separation around the @xmath90 radius , the contribution of the coulomb interaction is around 10 - 20  mev . for heavy quark ,",
    "the constituent mass @xmath124 is around the current mass @xmath94 . for a @xmath0 ,",
    "the contribution of the self - energy can be estimated around @xmath12540  mev .",
    "so , if we neglect the kinetic energy of the quarks assumed fixed at the centre of mass , we can take the point - like @xmath0 with a mass equal to @xmath126 .",
    "we estimate that this approximation can generate an error on hybrid glueball around 100  mev .",
    "the masses of hybrids are given up to @xmath127 with the masses of @xmath57 and @xmath0 mesons ( see table  [ tab : m ] and fig .  [",

    "we compute the masses of the lightest glueballs and hybrid gluelumps ( gluon with a point - like @xmath0 pair ) within the framework of a simple effective model of qcd derived from the rotating string model @xcite .",
    "the corresponding semirelativistic hamiltonian is dominated by a linear confinement , supplemented by a one gluon exchange interaction and a contribution from self - energy for the quarks only .",
    "it is assumed that the casimir scaling hypothesis is well verified , and that two gluons are attached by an adjoint string in a glueball , while the gluon and the colour octet @xmath0 pair are attached by two fundamental strings in a hybrid gluelump .",
    "values of effective string tension @xmath3 and colour factor @xmath18 for the different hadrons considered here are gathered in table  [ tab : eff ] .      in order to minimize the contributions of the spin dependent interactions , only the masses of states with maximal spin",
    "have been calculated .",
    "this strongly constraints the values of our three free parameters : the mass of the charm quark , the strong coupling constant and the string tension in a meson . with these parameters , we find glueballs and hybrid gluelumps with masses relatively small @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the coulomb interaction is about 100 - 200  mev , depending on the particular hadron .",
