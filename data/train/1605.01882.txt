    "let @xmath3 be a one parameter family of riemannian metrics for @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "we say that the time - dependent @xmath8 is a generalized geometric flow if it is evolving by the following equation @xmath9\\ ] ] with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the maximal time of existence , i.e. , @xmath13 is the first time where the flow blows - up and @xmath14 is a general time - dependent symmetric @xmath15-tensor . here @xmath14 is smooth in both variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this is obvious since @xmath18 is smooth in both variables also .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath19 in ( [ eq11 ] ) is insignificant while the negative sign may be important in some specific applications for the purpose of keeping the flow either forward or backward in time .",
    "two popular examples of geometric flows are the ricci flow where @xmath20 ( the ricci curvature tensor ) and the mean curvature flow , in which case @xmath21 ( here @xmath22 is the mean curvature and @xmath23 is the second fundamental form on @xmath24 )",
    ".    one may impose boundedness condition on the tensor @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , such boundedness and sign assumptions on @xmath14 are preserved as long as the flow exists , so it follows that the metrics are uniformly equivalent .",
    "precisely , if @xmath25 , where @xmath26 $ ] is the flow , then @xmath27 to see the above bounds ( [ eq2.3 ] ) we consider the evolution of a vector form @xmath28 . by the equation ( [ eq11 ] ) and by the boundedness of the tensor @xmath29 we have @xmath30 which implies ( by integrating from @xmath31 ) @xmath32 taking the exponential of this estimate with @xmath33 and @xmath34 yields @xmath35 from which the uniform boundedness of the metric follows .",
    "thus , if there holds boundedness assumption @xmath25 , the metric @xmath3 are uniformly bounded below and above for all time @xmath36 under the geometric flow ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "then , it does not matter what metric we use in the argument that follows .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the evolution , monotonicity and differentiability of the first nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath4-laplace operator on the @xmath1-dimensional compact riemannian manifold whose metric evolves by ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4-laplace operator is defined as @xmath37 for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the divergence operator , the adjoint of gradient ( @xmath40 ) for the @xmath41-norm induced by @xmath42 on the space of differential forms . when @xmath6 , @xmath43 is the usual laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of @xmath44 satisfy the following nonlinear eigenvalue problem @xmath45    it is easily verifiable that the principal symbol of ( [ eq12 ] ) is nonnegative everywhere and strictly positive at the neighbourhood of the point where @xmath46 . we know",
    "that ( [ eq12 ] ) has weak solutions with only partial regularity of class @xmath47 in general .",
    "interested readers can find the classical papers by l. evans @xcite and p. tolksdorff @xcite .",
    "notice that the least eigenvalue of @xmath48 on compact manifold without boundary is zero with the corresponding eigenfunction being a constant .",
    "hence , we refer to the infimum of the positive eigenvalues as the first nonzero eigenvalue or simply the first eigenvalue .",
    "the first eigenvalue of @xmath44 is characterised by the min - max principle @xmath49 satisfying the following constraint @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the volume measure on @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , the infimum does not change when one replaces @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction is the energy minimizer of rayleigh quotient ( [ eq13 ] ) and satisfies the following euler - lagrange equation @xmath54d\\mu_g= 0\\ ] ] for @xmath55 in the sense of distribution .",
    "the problem of finding @xmath56 is related to the problem of finding the best constant @xmath57 in the @xmath58-sobolev inequality @xmath59 which is obtained by continuous embedding of @xmath60 under the sobolev norm @xmath61    it is well - known that @xmath4-laplacian has discrete eigenvalues but still remains unknown whether it only has discrete eigenvalues for bounded connected domains .",
    "another well - known results tell us that the first nonzero eigenvalue is simple and isolated @xcite . here",
    "the simplicity shows that any nontrivial eigenfunction corresponding to @xmath62 does not change sign and that any two first eigenfunctions are constant multiple of each other .",
    "in contrast to the spectrum of laplace - beltrami operator ( the case @xmath6 ) , the @xmath4-laplacian is nonlinear in general . for instance",
    ", the case @xmath63 gives @xmath64 , the negative of mean curvature operator .",
    "aside being of geometric interests , the @xmath4-laplacian appears naturally in the study of non - newtonian fluids , nonlinear elasticity , heat radiation , porous media flow , rheology , petroleum extraction , brownian motions , torsional creep problem among others . for details of physical applications of @xmath4-laplacian ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not known if @xmath62 or its corresponding eigenfunction is @xmath65-differentiable ( or even locally lipschitz ) along any geometric flow of the form ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the differentiability for the case @xmath6 is a consequence of eigenvalue perturbation theory , see for instance @xcite . for this reason , the method of l. ma @xcite , which assumes differentiability of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions under the ricci flow , can only be applied to find the monotonicity of first eigenvalue for the case @xmath6 along ( [ eq11 ] ) . now to avoid the differentiability assumption on the first eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunction in the case @xmath66 , we shall apply techniques of cao @xcite as used by wu @xcite and wu , wang and zheng @xcite under the ricci flow to study the evolution and monotonicity of @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are assumed to be smooth . the evolution and the monotonicity formulas for",
    "the first eigenvalue ( in both cases @xmath6 and @xmath70 ) derived here do not depend on the evolution of the eigenfunction .",
    "the eigenfunction only needs to satisfy certain normalization condition .",
    "there are many results on the evolution and monotonicity of eigenvalues of the laplace operator on evolving manifolds with or without curvature assumptions .",
    "one can find @xcite under the ricci flow , @xcite under ricci - harmonic map flow and @xcite along abstract geometric flow with entropy methods .",
    "the study of the properties of eigenvalues of the @xmath4-laplacian on evolving manifold is still very young .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to investigate if those known properties of @xmath62 on static metric and for the case @xmath6 on evolving metric can be extended to various geometric flow .",
    "we however intend to develop a unified algorithm that can be used for this purpose on time - dependent metrics .",
    "many interesting results concerning the behaviour of @xmath62 can be found in @xcite for static metrics and @xcite for evolving metrics along various geometric flow .",
    "the rest of this paper is planned as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we discuss the main results of this paper .",
    "firstly , we highlight some notations about differential geometry including metrics , gradient , divergence and integration by parts , which form the core of analytic tools used in the paper .",
    "we also prove some technical lemmas about evolutions of some geometric objects relating to the eigenvalues under the flow ( [ eq11 ] ) . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we study the first eigenvalue of laplace - beltrami operator ( @xmath6 ) under this geometric flow . here , we assume the first eigenvalue to be a function of time only and obtain its general evolution and monotonicity formula under certain condition . in section [ sec4 ] , we use a different approach to derive @xmath4-eigenvalue s evolution and monotonicity without differentiability assumption on the eigenfunction . in fact , the differentiability of @xmath4-eigenvalue is a consequence of the monotonicity formula . in the last section , we list some examples of geometric flows where the approaches used in this paper are applicable .",
    "in fact , this section reveals that our generalised geometric flow is not a trivial generalisation .",
    "throughout , @xmath24 will be taken to be a closed manifold ( i.e. , compact without boundary ) .",
    "most of our calculations are done in local coordinates , where @xmath71 is fixed in a neighbourhood of every point @xmath72 .",
    "we shall adopt einstein summation convention with repeated indices summed up .",
    "the riemannian metric @xmath73 at any point @xmath11 is a bilinear symmetric positive definite matrix denoted in local coordinates by @xmath74 the laplace - beltrami operator acting on a smooth function @xmath75 on @xmath24 is defined as divergence of gradient of @xmath76 , written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are determinant and the inverse metric matrix respectively . by the above",
    "we note that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a smooth vector field .",
    "also we have the metric norm @xmath82 the riemann structure allows us to define riemannian volume measure @xmath51 on @xmath24 by @xmath83 by the divergence theorem , we have the following integration by parts formulas : let @xmath81 be a vector field , @xmath84 and @xmath85 be smooth function , then @xmath86 also for functions @xmath87 @xmath88 we write in local coordinates gradient , hessian and covariant derivative as @xmath89 respectively . also we write time derivative as @xmath90 .",
    "interestingly , all the geometric quantities associated with the underlying manifold evolve as the riemannian metric evolves along the geometric flow .",
    "this also serves as a motivation considering the behaviours of some other important geometric quantities such as eigenvalues of the manifold under the flow .",
    "the next two lemmas give us these evolutions .",
