    "majorana zero modes have played an important role in condensed matter physics in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the majorana modes are the same as their own antimodes by definition , and they have been anticipated to appear as zero - energy bound states .",
    "there have been considerable efforts towards the realization of majorana modes in condensed matter settings  @xcite .",
    "the existence of majorana zero modes is of special interest because it can be applied to the physical construction of qubits for topological quantum computing  @xcite . from an experimental point of view , it is essential to investigate the effects of disorder  @xcite and interactions  @xcite",
    ". furthermore , various theoretical aspects have been revealed , including the connection with supersymmetry  @xcite , the generalization to parafermion modes  @xcite , and the construction of topologically invariant defects  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of majorana zero modes in condensed matter systems was first proposed by kitaev  @xcite .",
    "the kitaev chain is a one - dimensional lattice model that describes a spin - polarized @xmath0-wave superconductor with open boundaries .",
    "this model possesses a topological phase with two - fold degenerate ground states which are robust against local perturbations that preserve the fermion parity symmetry .",
    "the origin of the ground - state degeneracy in the topological phase is the presence of majorana zero modes .",
    "these zero - energy modes , often called strong zero modes , commute with the hamiltonian and anti - commute with the fermionic parity , and are localized near the boundaries .",
    "however , the existence of a topological phase can be manifested by only a minimal degeneracy , the ground - state degeneracy , say , leading to the notion of a ` weak zero mode  @xcite ' that only commutes with the projected hamiltonian onto the low - energy manifold .",
    "moreover , the celebrated bulk - boundary correspondence is one of the most crucial properties for the topological phases of matter as a general rule , which topological insulators also exhibit  @xcite . here ,",
    "the fundamental question that should be addressed is whether majorana zero modes can persist for a system without boundaries .",
    "naively , one might think that there will be no zero - mode since there is no `` edge '' in the system .    in this paper ,",
    "we will answer the above question by investigating the kitaev chains with generalized twisted boundary conditions ( tbcs ) , i.e. , we arbitrarily control the amplitudes and the phases of the couplings on the boundaries . the usual periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) and the anti - periodic boundary condition ( apbc )",
    "are included in the tbc as limiting cases . in practice",
    ", such a boundary condition can be realized by magnetic fluxes or josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "our work is motivated by the observation that the fermionic parities in the ground states of the kitaev chain with pbc and apbc have opposite signs in the topological phase , hence indicating a level crossing when one continuously changes the parameters so as to connect pbc with apbc .",
    "when the open kitaev chain resides in the topological phase , we show that for sufficiently large chains , majorana zero modes do appear when the phase parameters at the boundary are tuned to specific values , in spite of the absence of the edges .",
    "then , we obtain the condition for the presence of majorana zero modes in finite chains , as well as explicitly determine the spatial profile of the zero modes .",
    "we also investigate the robustness of these zero modes against interactions .",
    "the level crossing signaling a topological order is found to be robust against nearest - neighbor repulsive interactions , given that the bulk parameters are those of the interacting kitaev chain in the topological phase .",
    "this means that the zero modes ( at least in the weak sense  @xcite ) survive even in the presence of interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model , and point out that there should be majorana zero modes when we smoothly change the boundary conditions between the pbc and the apbc . in sec .",
    "[ sec : emergence of zero modes ] , we directly compute the pfaffian of the hamiltonian and show the precise condition for the existence of zero modes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exact zero modes ] , we present explicit forms of the zero modes and some other properties , including the full spectrum of the chain at zero chemical potential . we also demonstrate that the majorana zero operators are robust in the presence of spatially varying couplings . in sec .",
    "[ sec : interaction ] , we investigate the effects of nearest - neighbor repulsive interactions .",
    "first , the presence of the zero modes is confirmed for a fine - tuned solvable model , and then demonstrated in the weak sense for general parameters by numerical calculations .",
    "we conclude this paper in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] . in appendix",
    "[ app_pap ] , we calculate in detail the fermionic parity of the ground state of the kitaev chain for the pbc and the apbc . in appendix",

    "[ sec : mu0 detail ] , we give a detailed procedure for calculating all the eigen - energies of the chain with zero chemical potential .",
    "we consider a system of spinless fermions on a chain of length @xmath1 .",
    "for each site @xmath2 , we denote by @xmath3 and @xmath4 the creation and the annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "we impose a _ twisted boundary condition _ , in which the amplitudes and the phases of the parameters on the boundaries can be tuned arbitrarily .      although the hamiltonian @xmath24 does not conserve the total fermion number @xmath25 , the parity of the fermion number , i.e. , the fermion number modulo @xmath26 , is conserved since @xmath24 commutes with @xmath27 . besides , time - reversal symmetry , i.e. invariance under complex conjugation , is respected if the chain has the periodic or anti - periodic boundaries .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .   that the fermionic parity of the ground state of @xmath24 with pbc is odd in the topological phase . in order to see how the pbc is connected to the apbc through varying the twist parameters @xmath28 , we diagonalize @xmath24 by the usual fourier transform followed by a bogoliubov transformation under the pbc and the apbc ( see appendix  [ app_pap ] ) . the fermionic parity @xmath29 or @xmath30 in the ground state for the pbc or the apbc is summarized as follows :    1 .",

    ", the degeneracy of ground states actually indicates the existence of _ majorana zero modes _  @xcite .",

    "this is the unique ground state of @xmath250 at @xmath251 with apbc , because the other state @xmath258 does not minimize @xmath242 .",
    "the change of the parity between the pbc and the apbc for the interacting kitaev model again indicates the ground - state degeneracy at some point on a path @xmath259 that connects @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "therefore , the level crossing in the spectrum survives in the presence of interactions , under the frustration - free condition .",
    "we expect that perturbing away from the frustration - free line does not affect this conclusion unless the ( many - body ) gap closes .",
    "this motivates us to conjecture that the ground - state degeneracy on the path @xmath262 occurs in the topological phase of a more general ( not necessarily frustration - free ) interacting kitaev chain . to provide evidence for this ,",

    "[ fig : int ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the level crossing can be a signal of topological order even in the presence of nearest - neighbor repulsive interactions .",
    "in addition , the ground - state degeneracy at the crossing point suggests the presence of zero modes at that particular @xmath269 .",
    "an interesting question is whether the zero modes that map one of the ground state to the other are strong or weak .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the kitaev chain under generalized twisted boundary conditions characterized by the phase parameters @xmath273 .",
    "we found that the phases @xmath273 can be adjusted so that majorana zero modes appear as long as the bulk couplings are those of the kitaev chain in the topological phase . by computing the pfaffian of the hamiltonian matrix in the majorana basis",
    ", we obtained the condition on @xmath273 for the presence of majorana zero modes .",
    "the condition reduces to @xmath57 or @xmath93 in the infinite - size limit when the constraint @xmath274 is imposed .",
    "we then analyzed finite chains at @xmath57 and enumerated conditions on the other parameters under which exact majorana zero modes exist .",
    "a particularly interesting case is @xmath51 , where the exact zero modes must appear in a chain of odd length , irrespective of the details of the other parameters .",
    "the full energy spectrum for this case was analyzed in detail and the explicit expressions for the majorana zero operators that commute with the hamiltonian were obtained .",
    "the operators obtained are exponentially localized and hence normalizable in the infinite - size limit .",
    "we also showed that the presence of majorana zero operators survive even in the presence of spatially varying couplings , provided that @xmath57 and @xmath51 .",
    "the robustness of the zero modes at least in the weak sense persists even in the presence of interactions , as demonstrated by our analytical and numerical results .",
    "whether the zero modes at the level crossing point are strong or weak is an intriguing open question .",
    "it would also be interesting to see if and how the twisted boundary conditions lead to a level crossing in other systems such as parafermion  @xcite and xyz chains  @xcite , which are not reducible to free fermions .",

    "then the hamiltonian in @xmath279-space is given by @xmath280 where @xmath281 for @xmath282 , the ground state of @xmath283 is the vacuum of bogoliubov quasiparticles : @xmath284 where @xmath285 is the vacuum state of @xmath286 , and @xmath287 is the annihilation operator of bogoliubov quasiparticles , which has odd fermionic parity .",
