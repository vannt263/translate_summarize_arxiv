    "the properties of phase transitions and the types of order present in the low - temperature states of matter are fundamentally dependent on the dimensionality of physical systems  @xcite .",
    "generally , highly ordered states are more robust in higher dimensions , while thermal and quantum fluctuations , which favor disordered states , play a more important role in lower dimensions .",
    "the case of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose fluid is particularly fascinating because of its  marginal \" behavior . in an infinite uniform 2d fluid thermal fluctuations at any non - zero temperature are strong enough to destroy the fully ordered state associated with bose  einstein condensation , but are not strong enough to suppress superfluidity in an interacting system at low , but non - zero temperatures .",
    "further , the presence of residual  quasi - long - range \" order at low temperatures leads to an interesting interplay between superfluidity and condensation in all experimentally relevant finite - size systems .",
    "this behavior is characteristic of a wide range of physical systems which share some generic properties such as dimensionality , form of interactions , and hamiltonian symmetries .",
    "these include liquid helium films  @xcite , spin - polarized hydrogen  @xcite , coulomb gases  @xcite , ultra - cold atomic gases  @xcite , exciton  @xcite and polariton  @xcite systems . moreover , the berezinskii  kosterlitz ",
    "thouless theory which provides the general framework for understanding 2d superfluidity is also applicable to a range of physical phenomena in discrete systems , such as ordering of spins on a 2d lattice  @xcite and melting of 2d crystals  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we give an introduction to the physics of 2d bose fluids from an atomic physics perspective .",
    "our goal is to summarize the recent progress in theoretical understanding and experimental investigation of ultra - cold atomic gases confined to 2d geometry , and we also hope to provide a useful introduction to these systems for researchers working on related topics in other fields of physics .      the most familiar phase transitions in three spatial dimensions ( 3d ) , such as freezing of water , ferromagnetic ordering in spin systems , or bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) , are all associated with emergence of true long - range order ( lro ) below some non - zero critical temperature .",
    "such order is embedded in a spatially uniform order parameter , e.g. magnetization in a ferromagnet or the macroscopic wavefunction @xmath1 describing a bec .",
    "further , in all the above cases emergence of true lro corresponds to spontaneous breaking of some continuous symmetry of the hamiltonian . in case of crystallization ( freezing ) , translational symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "for heisenberg spins on a ( fixed ) lattice , the hamiltonian has a continuous spin rotational symmetry which is spontaneously broken in the ferromagnetic state . in case of bec , the phase of @xmath1 is arbitrarily spontaneously chosen at the transition . as we will discuss in more detail later , under certain conditions this makes a bose gas formally equivalent to a system of two - component spins on a lattice , the so - called xy model .    already in 1934",
    "peierls pointed out that the possibility for a physical system to exhibit true lro can crucially depend on its dimensionality  @xcite .",
    "peierls considered a 2d crystal at finite temperature @xmath0 , and studied the effects of thermal vibrations of atoms around their equilibrium positions in the lattice ( i.e. phonons ) .",
    "he found that the uncertainty in the relative position of two atoms _ diverges _ with the distance between their equilibrium positions : @xmath2 for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the atom displacement from its equilibrium position @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath7 denotes a thermal average .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding result in 3d is finite , and small compared to @xmath6 if @xmath0 is below the melting temperature .",
    "the result in eq .",
    "( [ peierls ] ) is in direct contradiction with the starting hypothesis of long - range crystalline order , since it implies that , based on the positions of atoms in one part of the system , we can not predict with any certainty the positions of atoms at large distances .",
    "the peierls result ( [ peierls ] ) is a simple example of the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking at non - zero @xmath0 in 2d .",
    "the absence of lro in low - dimensional systems was later more generally and formally studied by bogoliubov  @xcite , hohenberg  @xcite , and mermin and wagner  @xcite .",
    "the general statement is that lro is impossible in the thermodynamic limit at any non - zero @xmath0 in all 1d and 2d systems with short - ranged interactions and a continuous hamiltonian symmetry .",
    "this is now most commonly known as the mermin  wagner theorem . in all such systems hamiltonian symmetry",
    "is always restored by low - energy long - wavelength thermal fluctuations , the so - called goldstone modes . in the case of an interacting bose gas goldstone modes are phonons , while in the case of the xy model on a lattice they are spin - waves . as a direct consequence of the functional form of the density of states in low dimensionality",
    ", such modes always have a diverging infrared contribution and destroy lro .",
    "it is however important to stress that the absence of true lro does not preclude the possibility of any phase transitions in 2d systems , just the symmetry breaking ones . as we will see later",
    ", a phase transition associated with the apparition of a _ topological order _ does take place in a uniform 2d gas .",
    "in section  [ sec : uniform 2d ] we will explicitly see that bose  einstein condensation is impossible in both the ideal and a repulsively interacting infinite uniform 2d bose gas .",
    "the absence of true lro in these systems is seen in the fact that the first order correlation function : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the annihilation operator for a particle at position @xmath5 , always tends to zero for @xmath10 .",
    "note that these two statements are equivalent under the penrose - onsager definition of the condensate density  @xcite : @xmath11    however , the weak logarithmic divergence in eq .",
    "( [ peierls ] ) suggests that the destruction of lro is only marginal in 2d .",
    "the consequence of this weak divergence is that an interacting bose gas at low @xmath0 exhibits  quasi - long - range order \" , corresponding to @xmath12 which decays only algebraically with distance .",

    "further , the slow decay of @xmath12 at low @xmath0 has important consequences for condensation and symmetry breaking in the experimentally relevant finite - size systems .",

    "the bkt phase transition to a superfluid state occurs at a non - zero critical temperature , but the conclusion that bec transition does not occur remains true .",
    "we first introduce the description of interactions in an atomic 2d gas in   [ sec : tilde g ] . in   [ sec : density fluctuations ] we qualitatively discuss why interactions lead to a strong suppression of density fluctuations in a degenerate gas , so that the low - energy long - wavelength excitations ( phonons ) in this system are almost purely phase fluctuations . the bogoliubov analysis presented in   [ subsubsection : bogoliubov ] provides a more quantitative justification for this conclusion and also indicates why we expect an interacting 2d gas to be superfluid at very low @xmath0 . as we show in   [ sec : algebraic decay ] , the long - wavelength phonons still lead to a vanishing @xmath12 at @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , in accordance with the mermin  wagner theorem , these  soft \" goldstone modes still destroy the long - range order and restore the hamiltonian symmetry .",

    "we can see more explicitly why the density fluctuations are suppressed at sufficiently low @xmath0 , but the phase fluctuations are not , and also why it is natural to expect the low temperature state to be superfluid .",

    "the key conceptual ingredient of the bkt theory is that in addition to phonons described by the hamiltonian ( [ theta hamiltonian ] ) , another natural source of phase fluctuations are vortices , points at which the superfluid density vanishes , and around which the phase @xmath98 varies by a multiple of @xmath232 . for our purposes we can consider only  singly - charged \" vortices with phase winding @xmath233 , which are energetically stable . around an isolated single vortex , centered at the origin ,",

    "we can use an analogy with a coulomb gas : two nominally paired but well separated vortices create a field which polarizes the more tightly bound vortex dipoles between them .",
    "this results in an effective dielectric constant which reduces the attraction between two oppositely charged vortices .",

    "these two concepts are equivalent .",
    "we identified a range of parameters , such that @xmath450 , for which both effects occur . in the opposite regime of a small system and/or",
    "small @xmath75 neither of the two effects occurs .",
    "the question  what comes first \" is even more subtle in the case of a harmonically trapped gas because of the inhomogeneous density profile . in this case the notions of bkt - driven and interaction - enhanced condensation are not equivalent , and the answer depends on what we keep constant in an experiment , i.e. which path we follow in the phase diagram . since in a harmonic trap",
    "ideal gas condensation occurs even in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. if we neglect the discreteness of single - particle energy levels in the trap ) , we start by analyzing that case , and separately consider two different experimental paths :    * the critical phase space density @xmath303 for a bkt transition ( at a fixed non - zero @xmath75 ) is finite , while the critical phase space density for ideal gas condensation is infinite . therefore in a standard experiment where @xmath75 is kept constant and phase space density is increased , bkt - driven condensation always occurs . in this sense , in practice  bkt always comes first \" .",
    "* while the critical phase space density for the bkt transition ( at non - zero @xmath75 ) is lower than for the ideal gas condensation , the critical atom number at fixed @xmath0 is higher .",
    "the critical atom numbers @xmath451 and @xmath452 scale similarly with the temperature and the trap frequency ( @xmath453 ) , and the ratio @xmath454 is always larger than 1 .",
    "this can be seen from the mean - field result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ncanalytics ] ) or from the monte - carlo data shown in figure [ fig : psd_nc]b .",
    "this means that , at fixed @xmath33 , interactions always reduce the transition temperature .",
    "therefore , contrary to the case of a square box potential , we can never have interaction - enhanced condensation .    note",
    "that it is not inconsistent that the bkt transition occurs at a lower critical density but higher critical number than the ideal gas bec , because in a harmonic trap with fixed @xmath33 and @xmath0 the peak ( phase space ) density in a repulsively interacting gas is lower than in an ideal gas .",
    "also note that if we work within the bkt theory and then formally take the @xmath455 limit , we exactly recover the criterion for ideal gas condensation , which is usually derived from a conceptually completely different viewpoint of the saturation of single - particle excited states .",
    "we can therefore think of the bec transition as a special non - interacting limit of the more general bkt theory .",
    "this connection naturally emerges when analyzing the case of a harmonically trapped gas , but it could not be made in a uniform system , where the critical temperature for both transitions vanishes in the @xmath455 limit .    finally , we briefly comment on the case of a realistic experimental harmonic trap , where the spacing of the single - particle energy levels is non - zero .",
    "the results for the critical atom numbers for the bkt and the ideal gas bec transition are essentially unaffected by the non - zero level - spacing .",
    "it therefore remains true that interaction - enhanced condensation is not possible .",

    "this scenario is however not relevant for the currently realistic experiments .",
    "the value of @xmath456 is not universal and depends on the details of the trapping potential , but we have evaluated it numerically for a typical trap used in the ens experiments  @xcite , and obtained @xmath457  @xcite .",
    "this means that the condition @xmath458 can be fulfilled only in an extremely weakly interacting gas with @xmath459 .",
    "experimentally , this regime is essentially indistinguishable from the @xmath455 limit , where the bkt and the bec transition are no longer distinct .",
    "the divergence of the correlation length that we already discussed in the case of a square box potential ( see   [ width of the crossover in a box ] ) , must also be taken into account .",
    "suppose that one lowers the temperature of a cold gas in a trap until the bkt threshold density is reached right at the center of the trap .",
    "since the density is everywhere lower than the critical threshold for bkt , lda would imply that no significant superfluid fraction is present in the gas at this stage .",
    "however a significant part of the gas may exhibit a certain degree of coherence as we show now . the critical length ( [ bkt diverging ell ] ) is now position dependent , since the critical temperature is a function of the local density .",
    "since @xmath460 is a monotonically decaying function of the distance from the trap center @xmath14 , we can self - consistently assume that the gas is coherent over a region of radius @xmath461 such that @xmath462 .",
    "we can also provide a crude estimate of @xmath461 : @xmath463 . for practical parameters ( @xmath464 ) , we find @xmath465 , which means that this coherence actually extends over a significant fraction of the cloud when @xmath466 at the center of the trap .",
    "we can also estimate the width of the cross - over over which the condensed fraction becomes significant . if instead of taking @xmath466 at the center of the trap , we take @xmath467 then @xmath468 at the center of the cloud and no significant coherence exists at this point .",
    "the above analysis is confirmed at least qualitatively by numerical simulations performed using a classical field monte - carlo analysis .",

    "one measures the spatial density distribution in @xmath631 .",
    "this distribution exhibits a modulation along the direction @xmath636 , resulting from the interference between the initial state of the cloud and the state displaced by the distance @xmath637 : @xmath638 note that we assume here that no collision occurred during the time @xmath568 between the part of the cloud at rest in @xmath630 and the part moving at velocity @xmath639 in state @xmath631 .",
    "this is a valid assumption for the weakly interacting sodium gas of @xcite .",
    "the modulated density profile in eq .  ( [ eq : self_interf ] ) gives a direct access to the function @xmath640 .",
    "it can be observed with an imaging beam along the @xmath82 direction , so that its measurement does not involve any line - of - sight integration .",
    "this method can then reveal finer details than the one presented in ",
    "[ subsec : interf_two_planes ] .",
    "in particular the authors of @xcite could observe a gradual increase of the coherence length @xmath278 of the cloud , as expected from eq .",
    "( [ bkt diverging ell ] ) . for small phase space densities",
    "the measurement gives @xmath641 , and @xmath278 increases to much larger values when the temperature decreases towards the critical temperature @xmath238 .",
    "when @xmath642 a significant interference contrast is observed for all values of @xmath245 within the size of the central superfluid region .",
    "we have reviewed in these notes the theoretical basis for the understanding of the physics of 2d quantum fluids , and discussed some recent experiments performed with atomic gases .",
    "these experiments have given access to some aspects of 2d physics that were previously hidden or not measurable in other physical systems , such as the existence of thermally activated individual vortices or the spatial variation of the first order correlation function @xmath34 . however",
    "a number of issues is still open in the physics of 2d quantum gases , and we outline below some topics which are likely to be of experimental and theoretical interest in the future .    _ higher - order correlation functions . _ the matter - wave interference between two statistically similar , but independent quasi - condensates ( such as shown in figure  [ fig : interf ] ) , can reveal a wealth of information on the correlations within each individual 2d gas .",
    "so far only a fraction of this information has been harnessed , with the study of the average contrast of the interference pattern integrated over some area of interest .",
    "a convenient tool for extracting more complete information on @xmath13 as well as higher - order correlation functions is the full statistical distribution of interference contrasts .",
    "two limiting cases can easily be characterized : ( i ) if the two independent fluids are fully condensed , each image shows a 100% contrast , with the position of the fringes fluctuating randomly from shot to shot .",
    "( ii ) if each cloud exhibits only short - ranged correlations , the observed interference results from many uncorrelated fringe patterns along the light of sight , and the distribution of contrasts is an exponential function . for 1d gases , it is possible to describe quantitatively the transition between these two limiting cases  @xcite , and the experimental results  @xcite are in good agreement with the predictions . in the 2d case ,",
    "the evolution of the contrast distribution through the bkt transition is still an open problem .",
    "_ out - of - equilibrium dynamical effects .",
    "_ throughout this paper we restricted our discussion to the equilibrium properties of a 2d bose fluid .",
    "the study of dynamical effects , such as transient regimes , can reveal additional information about the system .",
    "for example burkov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the dynamics of decoherence between two planar bose gases , assuming that their local phases are initially locked together , and then the two gases are allowed to evolve independently .",
    "this can be achieved experimentally by having a weak potential barrier and hence large tunnel coupling between the two planes for @xmath643 , and then suddenly raising the barrier at @xmath644 .",
    "the contrast of the interference between the two gases gives access to the evolution of the phase distribution under the influence of thermal fluctuations . in  @xcite",
    "this contrast was shown to decay algebraically at long time , as @xmath645 , with the exponent @xmath646 proportional to the ratio @xmath647 .",
    "therefore , in addition to being a stringent test of thermal decoherence in a quantum many - body system , this out - of - equilibrium study could constitute a novel thermometry method .",
    "a related phenomenon occurs in 1d systems , where the interference contrast is predicted to decay as @xmath648 ( with @xmath649 constant )  @xcite , and this prediction is nicely confirmed in the experiments by the vienna group  @xcite .",
    "_ transition from 2d to 3d behavior .",
    "_ the possibility to vary the tunnel coupling between two or more planar gases can also be used to study the so - called  deconfinement transition \"  @xcite , corresponding to a gradual evolution from 2d to 3d behavior .",
    "the phase coherence between the planes will build up as the strength of the coupling is increased , creating a situation that is reminiscent of the high-@xmath397 cuprate superconductors . for a large number of parallel planes , the deconfinement transition should give rise to a true bose ",
    "einstein condensate  @xcite .",
    "the two - plane situation is also very interesting , and can lead to the observation of the kibble - zurek mechanism  @xcite : the superfluid transition temperature is higher for two coupled planes than for a single one , so that sudden switching on of the coupling between the planes ( initially in the normal state but close to the single - plane critical temperature ) constitutes a quench of the system , and one could observe the subsequent dynamical apparition of a macroscopic quantum ( quasi-)coherence .    _ tunable interactions . _",
    "as we have seen throughout the paper , interactions between particles play a crucial role in our understanding of the superfluid phase transition and condensation in 2d fluids .",
    "in contrast to the conventional 3d bec of an atomic gas , where the critical temperature can to a good approximation be predicted using the ideal gas model , the bkt transition is fundamentally interaction - driven .",
    "the strength of interactions also affects a variety of other phenomena such as the suppression of density fluctuations in the normal state and the connection between the 2d bose fluid and the xy model .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to revisit the various effects described in these notes while continuously tuning the strength of interactions with a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath650 ) we expect a gradual change from the bkt - dominated to the bec - dominated behavior , as discussed in sections  [ sec:2d gas in a box ] and  [ sec:2d gas in a trap ] .",
    "further , it would be very interesting to explore the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath651 ) , which is closer to liquid helium films .",
    "this regime , which is outside the domain of validity of the monte - carlo results @xcite , corresponds to the case where the scattering length @xmath65 becomes comparable the thickness of the sample along the kinematically frozen direction , @xmath489 ( see [ subsection : 2d interactions ] ) .",
    "there the very nature of two - body interactions is expected to change from 3d to 2d  @xcite .",
    "therefore , experimentally reaching the condition @xmath652 would correspond to producing a ",
    "truly 2d \" as opposed to a quasi-2d bose gas .    _ superfluid density .",
    "_ generally speaking , studies of coherence and correlation functions in a 2d fluid , which are well suited to experimental tools of atomic physics , are a natural complement to the  traditional \" studies of superfluidity based on transport measurements , which are well suited to other physical systems such as liquid helium films  @xcite .",
    "for example , we have so far assumed that the two types of measurements probe the _ same _ superfluid density ( see e.g.   [ subsec : interf_two_planes ] ) .",
    "however this correspondence may in fact depend on the theoretical model and the exact definition of the superfluid density , and be valid only within the effective low - energy theories .",
    "it is therefore important to stress that superfluidity in the traditional transport sense has not yet been directly observed in atomic 2d bose gases ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "establishing atomic 2d gases as experimental systems in which both coherence and transport measurements of superfluidity could be performed would be an important advance , as it would allow experimental scrutiny of the theoretical connections between the two types of probes , and a direct comparison of the different definitions of superfluidity .",
    "two promising schemes for a direct measurement of the superfluid density ( as traditionally defined through transport properties  @xcite ) in an atomic gas have recently been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the first scheme  @xcite is based on extracting the superfluid density from the in situ density profiles of a rotating 2d gas .",
    "the second scheme  @xcite is based on using a vector potential generated by raman laser beams to simulate slow rotation of a gas  @xcite , and allows direct spectroscopic measurement of the superfluid density .",
