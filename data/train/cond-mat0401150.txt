    "a droplet in contact with a substrate will try to spread to an equilibrium shape determined by young s law which describes the balance of surface tensions .",
    "there are many parameters which affect this process .",
    "for example surface disorder in the form of chemical or topological heterogeneities can pin a droplet or change its final shape .",
    "this has usually been viewed as a nuisance in experiments and applications .",
    "however with the advent of microfabrication techniques it is becoming possible to harness controlled surface topologies to explore new physical phenomena .",
    "a beautiful example of this , inspired by the leaves of the lotus plant , is a superhydrophobic substrate .",
    "the angle @xmath2 between the tangent plane and the droplet is usually known as the contact angle .",
    "the higher the contact angle the more repellent the surface .",
    "there are applications , for example raincoats and windscreens , where repellent surfaces are highly desirable .",
    "surface coatings and chemical modifications of the substrate are common ways to increase the contact angle but it is difficult to achieve an angle of more than @xmath3 .",
    "however surfaces patterned with posts on a micron length scale allow contact angles of @xmath4 to be reached  @xcite .",
    "another example is nanopatterning of substrates which is of particular interest for the semiconductor industry . applying a microstamp on a thin heated polymer film coating",
    "a substrate can create nanoscale patterns .",
    "the film dewets along the faces of the mold to form either thin lines or small patches .",
    "the present model has been used to simulate this new technique  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a lattice boltzmann algorithm which can be used to investigate the behaviour of droplets on topologically patterned substrates .",
    "lattice boltzmann is a particularly appropriate approach in that it solves the navier stokes equations but also inputs the thermodynamic information such as surface tensions needed to describe the behaviour of droplets .",
    "moreover its natural length scale , for fluids such as water , is of order microns where much of the exciting new physics is expected to appear .",
    "the method has already shown its capability in dealing with spreading on surfaces with chemical patterning  @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we summarise the algorithm and , particularly , describe the new thermodynamic and velocity boundary conditions needed to treat surfaces with topological patterning . in section 3",
    "we present results for a substrate patterned by an array of posts .",
    "the patterning leads to a considerable increase in contact angle .",
    "finally we discuss directions for future work using this approach .",
    "we consider a liquid - gas system of density @xmath5 and volume @xmath6 .",
    "the surface of the substrate is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the equilibrium properties are described by the free energy @xmath8",
    "@xmath9 is the free energy in the bulk .",
    "we choose a van der waals form @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the critical pressure , density and temperature respectively and @xmath16 is a constant typically equal to @xmath17 .",
    "the bulk pressure @xmath18    the derivative term in equation ( [ eq : freee ] ) models the free energy associated with an interface .",
    "@xmath19 is related to the surface tension .",
    "@xmath20 is the cahn surface free energy  @xcite which controls the wetting properties of the fluid .",
    "the lattice boltzmann algorithm solves the navier - stokes equations for this system . because interfaces appear naturally within the model it is particularly well suited to looking at the behaviour of moving drops .",
    "the lattice boltzmann approach follows the evolution of partial distribution functions @xmath21 on a regular , @xmath22-dimensional lattice formed of sites @xmath23 .",
    "the label @xmath24 denotes velocity directions and runs between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is a standard lattice topology classification .",
    "the @xmath28 lattice we use here has the following velocity vectors @xmath29 : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 in lattice units as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d3q15 ] .",
    "the lattice boltzmann dynamics are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the time step of the simulation , @xmath37 the relaxation time and @xmath38 the equilibrium distribution function which is a function of the density @xmath39 and the fluid velocity @xmath40 , defined through the relation @xmath41    the relaxation time tunes the kinematic viscosity as  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the lattice spacing and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are coefficients related to the topology of the lattice .",
    "these are equal to @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively when one considers a @xmath28 lattice ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that equation  ( [ eq : lbdynamics ] ) reproduces the navier - stokes equations of a non - ideal gas if the local equilibrium functions are chosen as @xmath48 where einstein notation is understood for the cartesian labels @xmath49 and @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath50 ) and where @xmath51 labels velocities of different magnitude .",
    "a possible choice of the coefficients is  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the major challenge in dealing with patterned substrates is to handle the boundary conditions correctly .",
    "we consider first wetting boundary conditions which control the value of the density derivative and hence the contact angle .",
    "for flat substrates a boundary condition can be established by minimising the free energy ( [ eq : freee ] )  @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the unit vector normal to the substrate .",
    "it is possible to obtain an expression relating @xmath58 to the contact angle @xmath2 as  @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 and the function @xmath61 returns the sign of its argument .    equation ( [ eq : cahn1 ] ) is used to constrain the density derivative for sites on a flat part of the substrate . however , no such exact results are available for sites at edges or corners .",
    "we work on the principle that the wetting angle at such sites should be constrained as little as possible so that , in the limit of an increasingly fine mesh , it is determined by the contact angle of the neighbouring flat surfaces .    for edges ( labels @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ fig : postmask ] ) and corners ( labels @xmath63 ) at the top of the post each site has @xmath64 neighbours on the computational mesh . therefore these sites can be treated as bulk sites .    at bottom edges where the post abuts the surface ( labels @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig : postmask ] ) density derivatives in the two directions normal to the surface ( e.g. @xmath66 and @xmath26 for sites labeled @xmath67 ) are calculated using @xmath68 where the middle term constrains the density derivative in the appropriate direction @xmath66 or @xmath69 .    at bottom corners where the post joins the surface ( labels @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig : postmask ] ) density derivatives in both the @xmath66 and @xmath69 directions are known .",
    "therefore these sites are treated as planar sites .",
    "we impose a no - slip boundary condition on the velocity .",
    "because the collision operator ( the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : lbdynamics ] ) ) is applied at the boundary the usual bounce - back condition is not appropriate as it would not ensure mass conservation  @xcite .    indeed after applying equation ( [ eq : lbdynamics ] ) there are missing fields on the substrate sites because no fluid has been propagated from the solid .",
    "missing fields are determined to fulfill the no - slip condition given by equation ( [ lb : velocity ] ) with @xmath71 .",
    "this does not uniquely determine the @xmath21 s .",
    "for most of the cases ( i.e. @xmath72 ) arbitrary choices guided by symmetry are used to close the system .",
    "this is no longer possible for sites @xmath73 where four asymmetrical choices are available .",
    "selecting one of those solutions or using a simple algorithm which chooses one of them at random each time step leads to very comparable and symmetrical results .",
    "hence we argue that an asymmetrical choice can be used .",
    "possible conditions , which are used in the results reported here , are listed in table  [ tab : cond ] .",
    ".velocity boundary conditions . [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the conservation of mass is ensured by setting a suitable rest field , @xmath74 , equal to the difference between the density of the missing fields and the one of the fields entering the solid after collision .",
    "as an example we consider here the superhydrophobic behaviour of droplet spreading on a substrate patterned by square posts arranged as in fig . [ fig : substrate ] .",
    "the size of the domain is @xmath75 and the height , spacing and width of posts are @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "a spherical droplet of radius @xmath79 is initially centered around the point @xmath80 .",
    "the contact angle @xmath81 is set on every substrate site .",
    "the surface tension and the viscosity are tuned by choosing parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "the liquid density @xmath84 and gas density @xmath85 are set to @xmath86 and @xmath87 and the temperature @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig : results1 ] shows the final state attained by the droplet for different substrates and initial conditions . for comparison fig .",
    "[ fig : results1](a ) shows a planar substrate .",
    "the equilibrium contact angle is @xmath89 as expected  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : results1](b ) the substrate is patterned and the initial velocity of the drop is zero . now the contact angle is @xmath90 , a demonstration of superhydrophobic behaviour .",
    "[ fig : results1](c ) reports an identical geometry but a drop with an initial impact velocity .",
    "now the drop is able to collapse onto the substrate and the final angle is @xmath91 .",
    "these angles are compatible with the ones reported in  @xcite where similar parameters are considered .",
    "m1cmm5cmm0.5cmm5 cm ( a ) & & & + ( b ) & & & + ( c ) & & & +    for the parameter values used in these simulations the state with the droplet suspended on the posts has a slightly higher free energy than the collapsed state .",
    "it is a metastable state and the droplet needs an impact velocity to reach the true thermodynamic ground state . for macroscopic drops gravity will also be important in determining whether the drop remains suspended on top of the posts .",
    "extrand has predicted the minimum post perimeter density necessary for a droplet to be suspended  @xcite .",
    "a next step will be to add gravity to the simulation to compare to his prediction .",
    "superhydrophobicity occurs over a wide range of @xmath22 , the distance between the posts . for suspended drops of this size and",
    "@xmath92 the drop resides on a single post and the contact angle is @xmath93 . for @xmath94",
    "the contact angle lies between @xmath95 and @xmath1 with the range primarly due to the commensurability between drop radius and post spacing .",
    "it is of course also of interest to look further at the dynamics of the spreading .",
    "the droplet random motion reported in  @xcite and the bouncing back of droplets on nanotubes  @xcite pose many interesting directions for future research .",
    "we have proposed a lattice boltzmann model describing the spreading of a droplet on topologically patterned substrates . as an example , we have considered a substrate patterned with posts and found superhydrophobic behaviour in agreement with experiments  @xcite .",
