    "consider a true density @xmath220 , which is given by a ground state in an external potential @xmath26 . if the state is non degenerate ( or at least finitely degenerated ) and if it is stable , we have no accumulation point of the level crossing points for @xmath234 $ ] at @xmath128 in the searching process utilizing a potential problem with the reduced interaction strength .",

    ". we can introduce distance between two models given by the norm of the charge density and then the set of models with the charge distance becomes a space of models .",
    "an advantage of this generalization of dft is that we can search for an optimized model in a space of models including non - interacting fermion models and interacting fermion models .    in an optimization process in the model space , the density is searched in a @xmath3-representable subset .",
    "thus , in a realization of mr - dft , we never meet the accumulation of unreachable crossing points , when we see a convergence of the density in a searching step .",
