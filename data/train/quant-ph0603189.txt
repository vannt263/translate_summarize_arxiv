    "optical phase measurements are a valuable means for high precision measurement of displacement , for example for gravitational wave detection @xcite .",
    "two types of phase measurement can be distinguished .",
    "the first is measuring the phase of a beam or pulse of light relative to that of a strong local oscillator , which is treated classically .",
    "the second is measuring the phase shift between the light beams in the two arms of an interferometer , both of which are treated quantum mechanically . in this paper",
    "we are concerned solely with the first type .",
    "phase measurements are most easily analyzed , and thus best understood , for a single mode pulse with a fixed phase .",
    "the optimal measurement scheme ( for all commonly produced states ) for such a single - shot measurement is the so - called canonical measurement @xcite . for coherent states , where the quantum noise is independent of the quadrature , the canonical phase variance @xcite asymptotes @xmath4 in the large @xmath5 limit , where @xmath6 is the mean photon number .",
    "the @xmath7 scaling is referred to as the standard quantum limit ( sql ) . on the other hand , for more general states where the noise is quadrature - dependent , the canonical phase variance may approach the heisenberg limit @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to achieve canonical measurements with linear optical elements ( unless one discards most of the measurement results @xcite ) .",
    "one solution that has been developed is to use feedback .",
    "the field is combined with a local oscillator at a beam splitter , and partial results during the measurement are fed back to adjust the phase of the local oscillator for measuring the field in the next part of the pulse .",
    "this approach has been extensively studied for single - shot measurements , and it has been shown that it can achieve scalings almost at the heisenberg limit @xcite .",
    "it has also been experimentally realized @xcite , verifying an improvement over non - adaptive ( heterodyne ) detection .",
    "however , because the experiment used coherent states , it was not possible to verify a scaling better than the sql .    in practice",
    "it is easier to produce a continuous squeezed beam rather than a squeezed pulse of light .",
    "this motivates considering continuous , rather than single - shot , measurements . in the continuous case , if the phase to be measured is constant , then the variance will become arbitrarily small with time . to obtain a nontrivial result ,",
    "it is necessary to consider a phase which varies in time .",
    "we wish to determine how accurately the measurement scheme estimates this varying phase .",
    "the simplest model for a varying phase is a wiener process ; that is , its rate of change is gaussian white noise with intensity @xmath2 , giving rise to a lorentzian lineshape of the beam with width @xmath2 .    continuous measurements of this type were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , coherent beams and broadband squeezed beams were considered , and a simple method for filtering the data to obtain the phase estimate was used .",
    "a scaling law for the optimal variance ( or mean - square error ) of the squeezed beam was derived which showed an improvement over the coherent beam result . however , as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this analysis had two short - comings ( which tend to counteract each - other ) .",
    "first , it considered only the photon flux due to the coherent component of the beam , whereas in fact the photon flux from the broadband squeezing is strictly infinite .",
    "second , its filtering technique ignored the fact that phase information may be obtained from the photocurrent _ noise _ @xcite .",
    "for broadband squeezing the information from the noise is strictly infinite , and would allow the phase to be determined exactly , modulo @xmath9 .    ref .",
    "@xcite adopted a more sophisticated ( bayesian ) filtering of the state , but restricted its attention to coherent states .",
    "it found different results for @xmath10 , though the asymptotic variance of @xmath11 for @xmath12 was the same as found in ref .",
    "an asymptotic improvement by a factor of @xmath13 over non - adaptive ( heterodyne ) detection was also confirmed .",
    "in this paper we apply a bayesian approach to phase measurements on a _ narrowband _ squeezed beam .",
    "this estimation procedure optimally uses the phase information obtained from both the mean field and from the noise .",
    "the narrowband squeezing ensures that the photon flux , and the rate of information accumulation in the photocurrent record , are finite . to obtain analytical results",
    ", we concentrate on the asymptotic regime .",
    "we find an approximate analytical expression for the optimal scaling of the phase variance as @xmath14 , and confirm this via numerical simulations .",
    "our analysis confirms that there is a scaling advantage over the sql , although it is slightly less than we had previously thought @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ simple ] we give a simple explanation of the scaling , and explain why it is different from that in ref .",
    "then we give the bayesian analysis of measurements with feedback in sec .",
    "[ sec : bay ] , and of heterodyne measurements in sec.[sec : het ] .",
    "we revisit the scaling based on the bayesian treatment in sec.[sec : rev ] , then give numerical results in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] . we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , and give additional details of the derivations in the appendices .",
    "in this section we give a simple explanation to predict the scaling of the phase variance under continuous adaptive measurements .",
    "first we discuss the simple case of a coherent beam , then we proceed to the case of squeezing .",
    "the configuration considered is as in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , although for the moment everything to the left of the dashed line should be ignored .",
    "the coherent signal beam has photon flux ( i.e.  mean number of photons per unit time ) @xmath15 .",
    "a phase shift @xmath16 ( to be estimated by the experimenter ) is imposed on the signal , and a known phase shift of @xmath17 may be imposed by the experimenter on the local oscillator .",
    "these are combined at a beam splitter , and the difference photocurrent @xmath18 gives a measurement of a quadrature of the signal .",
    "feedback may be used to determine the phase @xmath17 for the local oscillator using a signal processor to filter the signal @xmath18 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath16 is also determined based on @xmath18 .",
    "is imposed on the continuous beam , and a phase shift @xmath19 is imposed on the local oscillator .",
    "these beams are incident on a 50:50 beam splitter , and the difference photocurrent @xmath18 is determined .",
    "the processor then adjusts @xmath19 based on @xmath18 .",
    "the simplest case is when the signal beam is in a coherent state , but for more accurate phase estimation a squeezed beam , produced by the apparatus to the left of the dashed vertical line , is used .",
    "this consists of a parametric down - converter characterized by intensity damping rate @xmath20 and @xmath21 nonlinearity parameterized by @xmath22.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    for fixed system phase and a coherent beam , the variance for adaptive measurements over time interval @xmath23 is @xmath24 this is simply the standard result for adaptive measurements on a coherent field with a mean photon number of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "if there is an estimate of the phase at time @xmath26 , then the phase estimate at time @xmath27 may be taken to be a weighted average of the estimate at time @xmath26 and the estimate obtained from data in the time interval @xmath23 .",
    "the variance at time @xmath27 will then satisfy @xmath28    now we assume that the phase fluctuations on the signal are white : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is gaussian white noise satisfying @xmath31 . taking account of these fluctuations , we expect the variance at time @xmath27 to be @xmath32 provided @xmath33 , the total change in the inverse variance is @xmath34 the steady - state variance is therefore @xmath35 this is just what was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the case of heterodyne measurements ,",
    "the variance for measurements over time interval @xmath23 is twice that in eq .",
    "then the last term in eq .",
    "is @xmath36 , and the steady state variance is @xmath37 thus the adaptive measurements give a @xmath13 reduction in the variance over heterodyne measurements .",
    "we may use a similar method in the case of squeezed states . in this case",
    "we have a number of new features to the model , indicated in fig .  1 by the apparatus to the left of the dashed line .",
    "the squeezed beam is produced by a cavity with decay constant @xmath20 .",
    "the beam has squeezing parameter @xmath22 and coherent amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "the flux is given by @xcite @xmath39    for squeezing which is not too large , the phase variance for adaptive measurements over time interval @xmath23 is , using the simple estimation technique of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath40 that is , the variance is reduced by a factor of @xmath41 from what would be obtained for a coherent state .",
    "the equivalent of eq .",
    "is then @xmath42 provided the dominant contribution to the flux is the coherent component , the steady - state variance is @xmath43    there is a limit on how large the squeezing can be before this approximation fails . in ref .",
    "@xcite the limitation considered was the error in the feedback phase , which causes the measurement to not be exactly on the squeezed quadrature .",
    "this limitation gives an overall scaling of @xmath44 .",
    "here we consider the additional limitation due to the finite squeezing bandwidth .",
    "for measurements performed over a time scale shorter than @xmath45 , no squeezing will be observed .",
    "in fact , it is necessary to perform measurements over a time scale of order @xmath46 before squeezing is observed . for @xmath47 large , this time is approximately the reciprocal of the decay constant for one of the cavity quadratures [ see eq .   in the following section ] .",
    "however , it is not obvious why this decay constant is important , because it relates to the antisqueezed quadrature .",
    "we give a more thorough explanation of this time scale in the following section .    the phase information used to obtain",
    "the phase estimate will be from a finite time interval . for times before @xmath48 , the system phase will differ from the current system phase by an amount comparable with the phase uncertainty .",
    "therefore , the majority of the phase information must be taken from a time interval of length approximately @xmath49 .",
    "we use @xmath50 to denote the inverse of this time interval , so @xmath51 .    in order to observe squeezing",
    ", this time interval must be longer than the time scale @xmath46 , so we require @xmath52 . here",
    "we are concerned with scaling , so we ignore multiplicative constants in the rest of this section . in order to obtain the scaling we also need to consider the limitation due to the squeezing contribution to the flux . from eq .",
    ", we have @xmath53 , so @xmath54 in order to obtain the minimum phase variance , we need to take the squeezing @xmath22 to be as large as possible consistent with the eqs .",
    "( [ sig ] ) and ( [ lower ] ) . that gives @xmath55 , so @xmath56",
    "note that if we had used the time scale @xmath45 , rather than @xmath46 , then we would have obtained the inequality @xmath57 . then eq .",
    "would become @xmath58 , and the maximum squeezing would be @xmath59 .",
    "this then would give the variance scaling as @xmath60 , which is identical to that in ref .",
    "thus we can see that the extra @xmath47 is essential to obtaining the different scaling here .",
    "this scaling will be shown to be correct numerically in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] .    in practice",
    "it is not possible to achieve arbitrary squeezing ; typically the maximum value of @xmath41 achieved is about 2 @xcite . in that case",
    ", we simply have the variance given in eq .",
    ", with @xmath22 taken to be the maximum experimentally achievable value .",
    "that is , the scaling is the same as for coherent states , but the variance is reduced by a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "note that we have the limitations on @xmath20 ( ignoring constant factors ) @xmath62 these limitations may be satisfied provided @xmath63 ; for @xmath64 this limit is about 16 .",
    "experimentally there is only limited control over the value of @xmath20 .",
    "however , for larger @xmath65 there is a wide range of values for which a reduction in the phase variance should be observed .",
    "now we give the detailed bayesian analysis of the phase estimates for narrowband squeezing .",
    "we will use this to justify some of the steps used in the previous section , as well as to estimate the additional phase information that may be obtained from the noise . a continuous squeezed beam produced by a cavity",
    "may be modeled by the operator equations in the heisenberg picture @xcite @xmath66 + \\sin(\\phi-\\theta)[\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\hat y+e-\\hat \\eta].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations are equivalent to eqs .",

    "this demonstrates that , even if it is not possible to adjust @xmath20 experimentally , there will be a wide range of values for which a reduction in the phase variance due to squeezing should be observed .",
    "the last issue which we address in this section is that of using @xmath240 rather than bayesian phase estimates . to estimate the accuracy of the @xmath240 phase estimates , calculations were also performed with bayesian phase estimates .",

    "there is not exact agreement with the numerically obtained ratio , but the estimate is close , particularly for the larger values of @xmath65 .",
    "we have undertaken a thorough analysis of adaptive estimation of a continuously varying phase for narrowband squeezed beams .",
    "the problem is characterized by photon flux @xmath15 , phase diffusion rate @xmath2 , squeezing bandwidth @xmath20 , and degree of squeezing @xmath41 ( i.e.  depth of squeezing of @xmath243 ) .",
    "if it is possible to achieve arbitrarily high squeezing , then adaptive phase measurements should give a variance scaling as @xmath244 , an improvement over the @xmath245 scaling for coherent beams .",
    "this variance is higher than that suggested by the broadband analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , which had a scaling of @xmath246 .",
    "the reason for this difference is that a time scale of @xmath46 is required before squeezing is observed .",
    "this means that the phase information must be obtained from a longer time interval than in the broadband case , and the system phase varies by a larger amount over this time interval . in the broadband case",
    "the limiting factor was the accuracy of the feedback .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the time scale required to observe squeezing is @xmath46 , rather than @xmath45 , which is what we would expect since @xmath20 is the squeezing bandwidth .",
    "the rate @xmath233 is the bandwidth of the antisqueezed quadrature , but it is only through the full bayesian analysis that one finds that this is the important rate .",
    "the difference of @xmath47 is crucial , because the scaling of the phase variance would be @xmath246 ( as suggested by the broadband analysis ) without it .",
    "the numerical calculations verify that the scaling is @xmath244 rather than @xmath246 , demonstrating that the factor of @xmath47 is correct .",
    "we performed a bayesian analysis of the phase , for both adaptive and nonadaptive ( heterodyne ) measurement schemes . in each case",
    "the analysis yields a variance - reducing term proportional to @xmath145 , which may be interpreted as the phase information from the coherent amplitude , as well as a term proportional to @xmath20 , which corresponds to phase information from the squeezed noise . except in cases where the dominant contribution to the photon flux is from the squeezing ,",
    "the phase information from the noise is predicted to be negligible .",
    "this means that it is possible to obtain accurate phase estimates using a simplified method rather than the full bayesian estimate .    in the experimentally realistic case where",
    "there is limited squeezing , the reduction in the phase variance is approximately @xmath47 . experimentally it is not possible to produce beams with arbitrary values of @xmath20 , though a limited amount of control is possible @xcite . for larger values of @xmath65 ,",
    "the variance is insensitive to the exact value of @xmath20 , and similar variances are obtained for a wide range of values of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore this issue is not expected to be a problem experimentally .",
    "a more complete analysis of the experimental feasibility of adaptive phase estimation on continuous squeezed beams will be given in a future work .",
    "the standard measure for phase uncertainty , used in most of the refs .",
    "@xcite is the holevo variance @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is the error in the phase estimate ; that is , the estimated phase minus the actual system phase . an alternative definition which avoids phase estimates with systematic error is @xmath249 @xcite .",
