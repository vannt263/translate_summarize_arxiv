    "recently a study of the @xmath12 interaction with the hidden gauge formalism @xcite was carried out in @xcite . the hidden gauge symmetry ( hgs )",
    "was introduced by bando - kugo - yamawaki where the @xmath0 meson was regarded as a dynamical gauge boson of the hgs of the non - linear sigma model .",
    "one of interesting facts which is relevant in the present discussion is that there is a strong attraction in the isospin and spin channels @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which is enough to bind the @xmath12 system leading to a tensor and a scalar meson which could be identified with the @xmath15 and @xmath16 meson states @xcite . in a later work the radiative decay of these states in @xmath17 , a channel with rates very sensitive to the nature of the resonances , was studied @xcite obtaining results in agreement with the pdg @xcite for the case of the tensor state and in qualitative agreement with preliminary results at belle for the scalar state @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite has been recently extended to su(3 ) for the interaction of the vectors of the nonet , where several states , which can be identified with existing resonances are also dynamically generated @xcite .",
    "the success of the approach encourages us to study the charm sector in the lightest case , the one for the interaction of the @xmath18 and @xmath2 mesons . another possible approach to this work",
    "could be done following the lines of @xcite for meson - baryon interaction involving @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "work in this direction is in progress @xcite but we can advance that while for pseudoscalar - baryon interaction the approaches are equivalent , when vector meson are involved the results are very different @xcite .    the starting point in our approachis the interaction of vector mesons among themselves provided by the hidden gauge formalism , which now has to be generalized to su(4 ) to accommodate the charm vectors @xmath2 into the framework .",
    "admitting that su(4 ) is more strongly broken than su(3 ) , the su(4 ) symmetry is invoked in the basic hidden gauge lagrangians but is already broken in the vector exchange diagrams that provide the amplitudes for the vector - vector interaction .",
    "what we find is a strong attraction in the isospin , spin channels @xmath20 which leads to bound @xmath21 states in all these channels . in the case of @xmath8",
    "we find repulsion and hence we do not generate states that would qualify as exotic from the @xmath22 picture . the states that we find qualify as mostly @xmath23 molecules , and fit nicely with the experimental states @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the present study would , thus , suggest for these states a different nature than the one usually assumed in terms of @xmath22 states @xcite .",
    "we follow the formalism of the hidden gauge symmetry ( hgs ) for vector mesons of @xcite(see also @xcite for a practical set of feynman rules ) .",
    "the lagrangian involving the interaction of vector mesons amongst themselves is given by @xmath25 where the symbol @xmath26 stands for the trace in the @xmath27 space and @xmath28 is given by @xmath29\\ , \\label{vmunu}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 the pion decay constant .",
    "the value of @xmath30 of eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) is one of the ways to account for the ksfr relation @xcite which is tied to vector meson dominance @xcite .",
    "the vector field @xmath33 is represented by the @xmath27 matrix which is parameterized by 16 vector mesons including 15-plet and singlet of @xmath27 , @xmath34 where the ideal mixing has been taken for @xmath1 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the interaction of @xmath37 gives rise to a contact term coming for @xmath38[v_\\mu , v_\\nu]$ ] @xmath39 depicted in fig .",

    "the formalism is the same used in @xcite .",
    "some approximations were made there which make the formalism handy and reliable , by neglecting the three - momentum of the vector mesons with respect to their masses .",
    "it is interesting to see that with this approximation one obtains @xcite from the hidden gauge approach the chiral local lagrangians which are used to study the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons among themselves and the pesudoscalar mesons with vector mesons and with baryons @xcite .      starting with the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lcont ] ) we can immediately obtain the amplitude of , for instance , @xmath45 corresponding to fig .  [",

    "@xmath46    where the indices @xmath47 and @xmath48 correspond to the particles with momenta @xmath49 and @xmath50 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "it is straightforward to write down all amplitudes for other channels .    in the approximation of neglecting the three - momenta of the vector mesons , only the spatial components of the polarization vectors",
    "are nonvanishing and then one can obtain easily spin projection operators @xcite into spin 0 , 1 , 2 states , which are given below :",
    "@xmath51    where the order @xmath52 in the polarization vectors is understood .",
    "we can then write the combination of polarization vectors appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhodvertex ] ) in terms of the spin combinations and thus we obtain the kernel of the interaction which will be later on used to solve the bethe - salpeter equation . however , it is practical to construct the isospin combinations before the spin projection is done .",
    "recalling that we have an isospin doublet with @xmath53 and one isospin triplet , @xmath54 , the @xmath55 and 3/2 combinations are written as    @xmath56    we then find the amplitudes in the isospin base by forming linear combinations of the amplitudes in the particle base weighted by the clebsh - gordan coefficients as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : isospincomb ] ) , @xmath57 these amplitudes , after projection into the spin channels , give rise to the following kernels ( potential ) for @xmath55 , @xmath58 and also for the case of @xmath8 , @xmath59 when one or two @xmath0 meson(s ) are replaced by the @xmath1 meson(s ) , where is only one isospin state @xmath55 , we find the following interaction terms , @xmath60 after projection in spin they become for @xmath61 , @xmath62 and in the same way , we have for @xmath63 , @xmath64      from the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ l3v ] ) we get the three - vector vertex as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . for practical purposes",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the three - vector lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ l3v ] ) as , @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ l3vsimp ] ) we have a three - vector vertex , where any of the three vector fields can correspond in principle to the exchanged vector in the diagram of fig .",
    "nevertheless , by assuming that the three - momenta of the external vectors can be neglected as compared with the vector mass , the polarization vectors of the external vector mesons have only spatial components . then by looking at the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ l3vsimp ] ) we see that the field @xmath66 can not correspond to an external vector meson . indeed , if this were the case , the @xmath67 index must be spatial and then the partial derivative @xmath68 is replaced by a three - momentum of the vector mesons which is neglected in the approach",
    ". then @xmath66 corresponds to the exchanged vector and this simplifies the calculation .",
    "the approximation of neglecting the three - momenta of the external vectors corresponds to the consideration of only the @xmath44-wave .        the vertex function corresponding to the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] is given by @xmath69 with this basic structure we can readily evaluate the amplitude of the first diagram of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig6 ] to obtain    . ]",
    "@xmath70    recalling that the three - momenta of the external particles is small and neglected , we arrive at the following expression : @xmath71 by looking at the structure of the second diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig6 ] we find the following result for the amplitude : @xmath72 we note that the amplitude @xmath73 with @xmath74 exchange vanishes because the three-@xmath74 vertex does not exist due to isospin invariance .",
    "we can see that in all the cases the combination of vector polarizations is the same .",
    "the isospin projections give us @xmath75 now using the equations for the spin projections we can split the terms into their spin parts and we obtain @xmath76 that is : we find spin degeneration in the amplitudes which involve the exchange of one @xmath0 meson .",
    "these structures can be simplified using momentum conservation and one finds : @xmath77 note that for the exchange of a vector we do not have contribution from the @xmath78 channel .",
    "indeed , the vertex @xmath79 and @xmath80 violate g - parity , and the the @xmath81 violates isospin . in the next section",
    "we consider the amplitudes which include also the exchange of one heavy vector meson , but we anticipate that the amplitudes calculated so far are more relevant than the other ones .      in this section",
    "we are going to take into account the exchange of one heavy vector meson , @xmath2 or @xmath82 , in the channels @xmath23 and @xmath78 , by means of the diagrams that we draw in fig .",
    "[ fig : exchd ] .        note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : exchd ] the vertex @xmath83 does not appear because it violates isospin . by means of the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ l3v ] ) we arrive at the following amplitudes for the first and second diagrams depicted in that figure , @xmath84 the isospin decomposition can be done as before by making weighted sums of eq .",
    "( [ eq : exchdu ] ) .",
    "we find , @xmath85 where @xmath86 . upon spin projection we find , @xmath87 and similarly for @xmath8 , @xmath88 again by neglecting the three - momenta of the external particles and by taking the center - of - mass reference system",
    ", one can express the factors which involve momenta as @xmath89    as we can observe , the spin degeneracy seen in the @xmath0-meson exchange amplitudes is lost in the @xmath2-exchange amplitudes .",
    "however , it is broken only a little due to the suppressing factor @xmath90 .",
    "the results are summarized in the columns titled `` @xmath2-exchange '' in tables  [ tab : amplitudes ] , [ tab : amplitudesrhoom ] and [ tab : amplitudesomom ] .",
    "these new terms represent corrections of the order of @xmath91 of the @xmath0-exchange ones . as can be observed in the total amplitudes , we find attraction in the sector @xmath55 , whereas the sector @xmath8 turns out repulsive .",
    "it is interesting to see that the exotic @xmath8 channel has a repulsive interaction .",
    "this seems to be a rather universal in this kind of studies @xcite .",
    ".@xmath92 for the different spin - isospin channels including the exchange of one heavy vector meson .",
    "the approximate total is obtained at the threshold of @xmath23 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have made a study of the @xmath93 interaction using the hidden gauge formalism .",
    "the interaction comes from contact terms plus @xmath0 meson exchange in the @xmath42-channel . of all spin and isospin",
    "allowed channels in @xmath44-wave , we found strong attraction , enough to bind the system , in @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we also found that in the case of @xmath96 the interaction was more attractive , than in the other two cases , leading to a tensor state more bound than the scalar and the axial vector .",
    "the consideration of the @xmath0 mass distribution gives a width to the three states , rather small in all cases .",
    "consideration of the @xmath97 decay channel , in an equivalent way to what was done in the case of the @xmath98 interaction going to @xmath99 in @xcite , makes the widths larger and realistic . yet ,",
    "the smaller phase space available here makes this contribution relatively smaller than in the case of the @xmath98 interaction .",
    "we found that the tensor state obtained matches the properties of the tensor state @xmath6 .",
    "we predict two more states with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which are less bound than the tensor state .",
    "we find in the pdg the state @xmath7 without experimental spin and parity assigned , but we conjecture that this state should be the @xmath101 state found by us because we could find a natural explanation for the small experimental width of this state . the other state nearly degenerate in energy with this one , but with spin @xmath100 , would still be to be found . the results obtained here should stimulate the search for more @xmath102 states in the region of @xmath103 .",
