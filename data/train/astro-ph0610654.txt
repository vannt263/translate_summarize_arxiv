    "behaviour of primary cosmic ray nuclei spectra in the vicinity of the ` knee ' is , undoubtedly , one of the key elements for solution of problem of high energy cosmic rays sources and for establishment of acceleration mechanisms .",
    "so , for example , non - monotonous behaviour of mass composition and additional breaks in all - particle spectrum in the energy range @xmath1  gev would support scenario with supernovae as the major cosmic ray sources and acceleration on shock - waves fronts up to the energies @xmath4  gev .",
    "particle spectrum produced by this mechanism may be represented as @xmath5 , where heaviside step function @xmath6 qualitatively reflects a sharp cut - off of the spectrum for @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the recent results on the proton spectrum of tibet collaboration  @xcite with no indications on cut - off in the spectrum up to @xmath8  gev allow to affirm , that proton spectrum in the considered energy range is formed by sources with generation spectrum being different from @xmath9 . on the other hand , in papers  @xcite it is shown , that all - particle spectrum in this energy range has several breaks .",
    "reconciliation of experimental results  @xcite and deductions  @xcite , based on the analysis of eas size spectra and data on cherenkov radiation of showers , is possible , in our opinion , only within the framework of the following scenario : 1 ) particle generation spectrum for energies @xmath1  gev in the principal cosmic ray sources is different from that of @xmath9 ; 2 ) contribution of young nearby supernova determines ` fine structure ' of the spectrum and non - monotonous character of mass composition behavior in the ` knee ' region .    in this paper",
    "we present new calculations of energy spectra and mass composition of cosmic rays , performed for the above formulated scenario of particles generation in two distinct types of sources under assumption of anomalous diffusion of particles in inhomogeneous galactic medium .",
    "the main purpose of the calculations is to determine conditions under which the proposed model ( two types of sources with different acceleration mechanisms + anomalous diffusion ) reproduces results of  @xcite .",
    "following to  @xcite , cosmic ray transport in fractal interstellar galactic medium with ` traps ' and without energy losses and nuclear interactions is given by anomalous diffusion equation @xmath10 here @xmath11 ",
    "anomalous diffusion coefficient , @xmath12  particle rigidity , @xmath13    the  riemann - liouville fractional derivative  @xcite : @xmath14 @xmath15    fractional laplacian ( ` riss ' operator )  @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath21 if @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the equation  ( 1 ) is just the normal diffusion equation .    for punctual impulse source with power energy spectrum @xmath24 , corresponding to particle generation processes in astrophysical objects , the solution of equation  ( 1 ) has the form @xmath25}^{t}\\tau^{-3\\beta/\\alpha}\\times\\\\ \\times \\psi_3^{(\\alpha,\\beta)}\\bigl({|\\vec{r}|(d(r,\\alpha,\\beta)\\tau^\\beta)^{-1/\\alpha}}\\bigr)d\\tau,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where function @xmath26  density of fractional stable distribution  @xcite .",
    "analysis of the obtained solution and its comparison with the available experimental data for energies below and above the ` knee ' allowed to determine the basic model parameters  @xcite .",
    "it is shown , that for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , anomalous diffusion model satisfactory describes the basic observable features of cosmic ray spectrum and mass composition in the wide energy range @xmath29  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the obtained all - particle spectrum for sources with @xmath30 practically coincides with ` background ' spectrum from paper  @xcite ( figure  [ ew1 ] ) . at the same time the calculations demonstrated that for purely power - like spectrum @xmath31 the model is unable to reproduce additional breaks in the region @xmath1  gev",
    "to find conditions when the model , formulated in introduction , is able to reproduce results of  @xcite , spectra of nuclei , all - particle spectrum and @xmath32 were calculated with the use of ( 2 ) and particle generation spectrum in the source of the form @xmath33 . as a criterion for determination of particle maximum energy , accelerated by supernova type source , we used conclusion on the considerable increase of @xmath32 in the region @xmath34  gev , obtained in  @xcite .",
    "results of our calculations , given in figures  [ allnucl][lna ] and in table  1 , show , that inclusion into system of sources with @xmath30 adopted in  @xcite , of the additional supernova - type source ( @xmath35  pc , @xmath36  yr ) , accelerating particles up to @xmath37  gev with output to proton component @xmath38  erg / source , allows to describe complicated structure of cosmic ray spectrum and mass composition in the vicinity of the ` knee ' .",
    "as mentioned above , the all - particle spectrum for sources with @xmath30 practically coincides with ` background ' spectrum from paper  @xcite .       in conclusion ,",
    "also , let us note , that verification of the hypothesis  @xcite about contribution of nearby supernova to the presently observed in the solar system cosmic ray spectrum may be accomplished via execution of additional measurements ( or complementary analysis ) , e.g. , of h , he and cno nuclei spectra in some energy regions . as follows from our calculations , presented in figure  [ allnucl ] , nearby supernova could give rise to inhomogeneities in the spectra of these nuclei in the regions of @xmath40 gev / nucleon ( h ) , @xmath41 gev / nucleon ( he ) , @xmath42 gev / nucleon ( cno ) .",
    "indications on the presence of such inhomogeneities in the spectra of he and cno in these energy regions are present in the data of jacee collaboration  @xcite ."
