    "_ is a organization and _ baghdad _ is a location . named entity recognition is an important task of information extraction systems .",
    "there has been a lot of work on named entity recognition , especially for english ( see borthwick for an overview ) .",
    "the message understanding conferences ( muc ) have offered developers the opportunity to evaluate systems for english on the same data in a competition .",
    "they have also produced a scheme for entity annotation @xcite .",
    "more recently , there have been other system development competitions which dealt with different languages ( irex and conll-2002 ) .",
    "the shared task of conll-2003 concerns language - independent named entity recognition .",
    "we will concentrate on four types of named entities : persons , locations , organizations and names of miscellaneous entities that do not belong to the previous three groups .",
    "the shared task of conll-2002 dealt with named entity recognition for spanish and dutch @xcite .",
    "the participants of the 2003 shared task have been offered training and test data for two other european languages : english and german .",
    "they have used the data for developing a named - entity recognition system that includes a machine learning component .",
    "the shared task organizers were especially interested in approaches that made use of resources other than the supplied training data , for example gazetteers and unannotated data .",
    "in this section we discuss the sources of the data that were used in this shared task , the preprocessing steps we have performed on the data , the format of the data and the method that was used for evaluating the participating systems .",
    "the conll-2003 named entity data consists of eight files covering two languages : english and german . for each of the languages",
    "there is a training file , a development file , a test file and a large file with unannotated data .",
    "the learning methods were trained with the training data .",
    "the development data could be used for tuning the parameters of the learning methods .",
    "the challenge of this year s shared task was to incorporate the unannotated data in the learning process in one way or another . when the best parameters were found , the method could be trained on the training data and tested on the test data .",
    "the results of the different learning methods on the test sets are compared in the evaluation of the shared task .",
    "the split between development data and test data was chosen to avoid systems being tuned to the test data .",
    "the english data was taken from the reuters corpus .",
    "this corpus consists of reuters news stories between august 1996 and august 1997 . for the training and development set ,",
    "ten days worth of data were taken from the files representing the end of august 1996 .",
    "for the test set , the texts were from december 1996 .",
    "the preprocessed raw data covers the month of september 1996 .",
    "the text for the german data was taken from the eci multilingual text corpus .",
    "this corpus consists of texts in many languages .",
    "the portion of data that was used for this task , was extracted from the german newspaper frankfurter rundshau .",
    "all three of the training , development and test sets were taken from articles written in one week at the end of august 1992 .",
    "the raw data were taken from the months of september to december 1992 .",
    "table  [ corpusstats ] contains an overview of the sizes of the data files .",

    "we created two basic language - specific tokenizers for this shared task .",
    "the english data was tagged and chunked by the memory - based mbt tagger @xcite .",
    "the german data was lemmatized , tagged and chunked by the decision tree tagger treetagger @xcite .",
    "named entity tagging of english and german training , development , and test data , was done by hand at the university of antwerp .",
    "mostly , muc conventions were followed @xcite .",
    "an extra named entity category called misc was added to denote all names which are not already in the other categories .",
    "this includes adjectives , like _ italian _ , and events , like _ 1000 lakes rally _ , making it a very diverse category .",

    "the tag also encodes the type of named entity .",
    "here is an example sentence :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ cols= \" > , < , < , < \" , ]      a baseline rate was computed for the english and the german test sets .",

    "if a phrase was part of more than one entity , the system would select the longest one .",
    "all systems that participated in the shared task have outperformed the baseline system .",
    "for all the f@xmath0 rates we have estimated significance boundaries by using bootstrap resampling @xcite . from each output file of a system , 250 random samples of sentences have been chosen and the distribution of the f@xmath0 rates in these samples is assumed to be the distribution of the performance of the system .",
    "we assume that performance a is significantly different from performance b if a is not within the center 90% of the distribution of b.    the performances of the sixteen systems on the two test data sets can be found in table  [ tab - results ] . for english , the combined classifier of florian et al .",
    "achieved the highest overall f@xmath0 rate .",
    "however , the difference between their performance and that of the maximum entropy approach of chieu and ng is not significant",
    ". an important feature of the best system that other participants did not use , was the inclusion of the output of two externally trained named entity recognizers in the combination process .",

    "there is no significant difference between them and the systems of klein et al . and",

    "we have combined the results of the sixteen system in order to see if there was room for improvement .",
    "we converted the output of the systems to the same iob tagging representation and searched for the set of systems from which the best tags for the development data could be obtained with majority voting .",
    "the optimal set of systems was determined by performing a bidirectional hill - climbing search @xcite with beam size 9 , starting from zero features . a majority vote of five systems @xcite performed best on the english development data .",
    "another combination of five systems @xcite obtained the best result for the german development data .",
    "we have performed a majority vote with these sets of systems on the related test sets and obtained f@xmath0 rates of 90.30 for english ( 14% error reduction compared with the best system ) and 74.17 for german ( 6% error reduction ) .",
    "we have described the conll-2003 shared task : language - independent named entity recognition .",
    "sixteen systems have processed english and german named entity data .",
    "the best performance for both languages has been obtained by a combined learning system that used maximum entropy models , transformation - based learning , hidden markov models as well as robust risk minimization @xcite .",
    "apart from the training data , this system also employed gazetteers and the output of two externally trained named entity recognizers .",
    "the performance of the system of chieu et al . was not significantly different from the best performance for english and the method of klein et al . and",
    "the approach of zhang and johnson were not significantly worse than the best result for german .",
    "eleven teams have incorporated information other than the training data in their system .",
    "four of them have obtained error reductions of 15% or more for english and one has managed this for german .",
    "the resources used by these systems , gazetteers and externally trained named entity systems , still require a lot of manual work .",
    "systems that employed unannotated data , obtained performance gains around 5% .",
    "the search for an excellent method for taking advantage of the vast amount of available raw text , remains open .",
