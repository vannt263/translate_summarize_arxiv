    "a search of novel monolayer materials is one of the important goals of material science and condensed matter physics research activity .",
    "graphene is considered as the most fundamental two - dimensional ( 2d ) monolayered material and it is one of the well studied 2d systems , both in theory and experiments , due to its many interesting novel properties and potential applications@xcite . however , the major disadvantage with graphene is that it has no electronic band gap and hence it is difficult to use graphene in semiconductor device applications .",
    "recently , the other group iv 2d materials such as silicene , germanene and stanene have attracted great interest @xcite , but it is also difficult to use them as semiconductor devices .",
    "phosphorene , a monolayer of phosphorus , has opened up the field of group v based 2d monolayer materials@xcite .",
    "it has an appropriate band gap for electronics applications and is shown to act as a field effect transistor@xcite . at present , the field is rapidly expanding ever since the experimental realizations of phosphorene@xcite . in the search of the semiconducting monolayer ,",
    "the focus is shifted to group v based systems , namely , nitrogenene , arsenene , and antimonene , which are nitrogen , arsenic and antimony based monolayers respectively .",
    "they have also been predicted to be stable by first - principles calculations@xcite . in case of group iii monolayers , planar aluminene , monolayer of aluminum ,",
    "is predicted to be stable but it is a metal@xcite .",
    "recently , a binary 2d system consisting of an equal number of two different elements draws growing attention .",
    "the properties of the binary 2d systems can be entirely different from those of elemental 2d systems .",
    "for instance , hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) , which has a planar honeycomb structure similar to graphene , shows insulating behaviour with a large band gap in contrast to the semi - metallic behaviour of graphene . in general , there are several possible materials , bn , aln , gan , inn , bp , alp , gap , inp , bas , alas , gaas , etc , consisting of equal numbers of group iii and group v atoms .",
    "these binary systems have the same number of valence electrons in an unit cell as that of graphene , silicene , germanene and stanene .",
    "hence , it can be considered as derivatives of group iv monolayers .",
    "it has been observed in previous studies that all the group iii - v binary counterparts of graphene , studied up to now , show semiconducting behaviour@xcite .",
    "now , it is natural to ask questions : whether there exist hexagonal monolayers made up of group iv and vi elements , which are counterparts of phosphorene , arsenene , antimonene or in general , monolayer derivatives of group v. if they exist , what are their properties ? from both fundamental and application points of view",
    ", it is important to perform studies on these group iv - vi binary systems .",
    "although there are some first - principles calculations on sns , snse , ges , and gese@xcite , all of them are known to be indirect - gap semiconductors .",
    "direct gap semiconducotors are desirable for practical applications . in this paper , we systematically investigate the geometric , energetic and electronic properties of group iv - vi monolayers ( xy ) ( with x = c , si , ge , sn and y = o , s , se , te ) by employing density functional theory ( dft ) based electronic structure calculations",
    ".    this choice of elements would give sixteen possible combinations of materials , namely , co , sio , geo , sno , cs , sis , ges , sns , cse , sise , gese , snse , cte , site , gete , and snte .",
    "for each of these 2d binary monolayers , we have considered three different possible geometrical configurations such as the puckered , buckled and planar structures .",
    "the binding energy calculations predict that all the sixteen binary monolayers studied in the present work are energetically stable .",
    "for most of the cases , the puckered configuration , similar to that of phosphorene , is the most stable configuration . among the minimum energy configurations , we observe that two systems sio and cse in the puckered configuration are direct band semiconductors with band gaps of 1.449 and 0.905 ev , respectively , while the remaining materials are indirect band gap semiconductors .",
    "moreover , our calculations predict that seven monolayers ( sns , sise , gese , snse , site , gete and snte ) in the puckered configuration undergo an indirect - to - direct band gap transition by the application of small mechanical strain ( @xmath0 3 @xmath1 ) .",
    "these results indicate that the group iv - vi 2d materials are promising materials for applications in light - emitting devices and solar cells .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the computational details employed in the present work .",
    "section iii contains the results and discussion , and then in section iv , we give summary of our results .",
    "density functional theory ( dft)@xcite based calculations have been performed using vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite within the framework of the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method .",
    "we employ generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) given by perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite for exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the plane waves are expanded with energy cut of 400 ev .",
    "we use monkhorst - pack scheme for k - point sampling of brillouin zone integrations with 41@xmath231@xmath21 and 31@xmath231@xmath21 for the puckered and buckled / planar configurations , respectively .",
    "the convergence criteria for energy in scf cycles is chosen to be 10@xmath3 ev .",
    "the geometric structures are optimized by minimizing the forces on individual atoms with the criterion that the total force on each atom is below 10@xmath4 ev /  .",
    "we choose the following valence electronic configurations for c [ 2s@xmath5 2p@xmath5 ] , o [ 2s@xmath5 2p@xmath7 , si [ 3s@xmath5 3p@xmath5 ] , s [ 3s@xmath5 3p@xmath7 , ge [ 4s@xmath5 3d@xmath8 4p@xmath5 ] , se [ 4s@xmath5 4p@xmath7 , sn [ 5s@xmath5 4d@xmath8 5p@xmath5 ] and te [ 5s@xmath5 5p@xmath7 . in order to mimic the two - dimensional system ,",
    "we employ a super cell geometry with a vacuum of about 18  in the direction perpendicular to the plane of 2d sheet so that the interaction between two adjacent unit cells in the periodic arrangement is negligible .",
    "the geometric structures are drawn using xcrysden software@xcite",
    "we consider the hexagonal monolayer structure made of group iv and vi elements in three different possible geometrical configurations , the planar , buckled and puckered structures .",
    "these three geometrical configurations are found to be the minimum energy structures of already known monolayer systems .",
    "graphene and hexagonal boron - nitride form the planar structure , while silicene , germanene and stanene possess the buckled structure .",
    "recently fabricated phosphorene has been shown to form the puckered structure .",
    "in addition , buckled phosphorene , which is named as blue phosphorene , has also been proposed theoretically@xcite . in the case of arsenene , it is observed that both of the puckered and buckled structures are stable and their binding energy difference is small@xcite .",
    "the hexagonal structure is bipartite consisting of the a and b sublattices .",
    "we assume that the group iv ( x = c , si , ge , sn ) atoms reside at the a sites , while the group vi ( y = o , s , se , te ) atoms reside at the b sites forming the hexagonal structure .",
    "the ball and stick model of group iv - vi monolayers in the buckled and puckered configurations are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the unit cell of the buckled structure contains one group iv atom and one group vi atom , while that of the puckered structure contains two group iv atoms and two group vi atoms as shown in fig.[figstruct ] .",
    "the results of the binding energy and geometric analysis of group iv - vi binary monolayers in these three configurations are summarized in table i. it is observed that the puckered structure is slightly deformed as compared with phosphorene since the two sublattices are not the same . in order to understand how the geometrical properties vary with the materials , we have also plotted variations of ( a ) the binding energy , ( b ) the lattice constant , ( c ) the bond length and ( d ) the bond angle of the binary monolayer xy in fig.2 .",
    ".the results of binding energy , geometrical parameters and band gaps for the group iv - vi binary monolayers in three different geometrical configurations , ( a ) puckered ( pmn2@xmath9 ) , ( b ) buckled ( p3m1 ) and ( c ) planar ( p6/mmm ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have studied in detail the geometric , energetic and electronic properties of group iv - vi binary monolayers ( xy , with x = c , si , ge , sn ; y = o , s , se , te ) by employing dft based calculations . for each material ,",
    "we have considered three possible geometrical configurations , the puckered , buckled and planar structures .",
    "our calculations predict that among these three configurations , the puckered structure , as that of phosphorene , is the minimum energy configuration , whereas the planar structure is the least stable configuration .",
    "moreover , the binding energy of the buckled configuration is very close to that of the puckered configuration .",
    "the electronic band structure calculations show that sio and cse in the puckered configuration are direct band gap semiconductors with gaps of 1.449 and 0.905 ev , respectively .",
    "interestingly , cse possesses the band structure quite similar to that of phosphorene , which suggests that the electronic properties of the former will be similar to that of the latter .",
    "hence , cse can be considered as an alternate 2d material of phosphorene .",
    "the similarity between cse and phosphorene can be understood by the fact that the electronegativity is identical for c and se .",
    "all the remaining group iv - vi binary monolayers are found to be indirect band gap semiconductors .",
    "it is observed that these semiconducting monolayers have very small difference between their indirect and direct band gaps .",
    "accordingly , by the application of very small mechanical strain ( @xmath0 3 @xmath1 ) , it is possible to modify the semiconducting properties from indirect to direct band gap for as many as seven binary monolayers ( sns , sise , gese , snse , site , gete and snte ) .",
    "finally , we note that there are several experimental reports on layered group iv - vi compounds such as sns@xcite , snse@xcite , ges@xcite , gese@xcite , gete@xcite .",
    "moreover , the results of geometrical parameters obained for group iv - vi monolayers match well with the experimentally obtained data for their corresponding bulk materials available in the literature .",
    "thus , it is possible to obtain their monolayer counterparts by the exfoliation method . in light of the existing literature combined with the present work",
    ", we expect that group iv - vi binary monolayers may well be promising 2d materials for future light - emitting diodes and solar cells .",
