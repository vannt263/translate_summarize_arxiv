    "in the last decade a considerable progress has been achieved in understanding of singular `` blowup '' solutions of nonlinear evolution equations with smooth initial data possessing finite energy .",
    "some issues under consideration were inspired by pioneering work by choptuik @xcite on a gravitational collapse of massless field .",
    "this task has been developed in a number of new ways including gravitational collapse of nonlinearly interacting massless fields , such as yang - mills field and nonlinear sigma - models @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "other related issues were motivated by recent studies on blowup in nonlinear wave equations @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the nature of the threshold of singularity formation is of particular interest .",
    "this problem was studied analytically and , mostly , numerically and it was realized that there are at least two kinds of critical solutions which play a role of local thresholds , separating dispersing and singular solutions .",
    "the thresholds of first kind are self - similar solutions possessing one unstable mode .",
    "critical solutions of this type can be both discretely self - similar or continuously self - similar .",
    "continuously self - similar thresholds are well - known solutions and their explicit form was found in some cases even analytically as solutions of system of ordinary differential equations after substitution of the `` self - similar '' anzats .",
    "discretely self - similar critical solutions are more subtle objects and they were discovered first in numerical studies of type - ii gravitational collapse of massless fields @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "black holes of arbitrary small mass ( type - ii gravitational collapse ) can be produced in this way and the critical discretely / continuously self - similar solution arises as a threshold , separating formation of naked singularity ( zero - mass black hole ) from dispersing solutions .",

    "all of these static solutions are unstable and have @xmath4 even - parity unstable eigenmode in a small linear perturbations approach .",
    "we have shown in one of our previous papers @xcite that this ymd system is supercritical in pde terminology @xcite and all solutions of the corresponding evolutional cauchy problem with `` large enough '' initial data result in finite time blowup .",
    "it is widely believed that a static unstable solution with one unstable eigenmode could be a threshold configurations in supercritical pde equations . in other words ,",
    "these static solutions should have stable manifold of codimension - one and the instability results from a simple negative eigenmode .",
    "this conjecture was proven in some cases analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "it was shown numerically in various models that blowup / scattering alternative in a final solutions asymptotics results from the sign of the excited single unstable eigenmode @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the considered ymd system represents more general case because it posessess an infinite family of the static solutions with @xmath5 unstable modes correspondingly .",
    "a stable manifold of these solutions with @xmath6 has a codimension more than one and few natural questions arise as a result : what is a role of higher static solutions with @xmath6 ; do they also relate to the distinct thresholds , separating blowup and scattering ; and if so , what is the role of higher unstable modes in this blowup / scattering alternative ?    to answer these questions , we systematically studied the decay of various lowest static ymd solutions under the independent excitations of all of their proper unstable eigenmodes .",

    "one should also expect that a part of the solution shrinking to the origin evolves in certain universal way prior to the singularity formation .",

    "just this the lowest @xmath85 self - similar solution can pretend to be a global stable attractor in the evolutional cauchy problem as was shown in @xcite .",
    "the cauchy problem for the system , , has been studied numerically for a wide range of smooth finite energy initial data .",
    "it turns out that if the initial data exceeds some threshold , the resulting solutions in a compact region that shrinks to the origin attain the @xmath85 self - similar solutions . these solutions , being self - similar , further evolve in the universal way in a finite time until the second derivative of the ym function at the origin starts growing infinitely what indicates on a singularity formation .",
    "it should be noted that such a singularity formation ( blowup ) at the origin is not accompanied by energy concentration according to the energy scale law .",
    "this scale law describes the energy of a self - similar part of the solution as it evolves , shrinking to the origin , whereas the total energy of the whole configuration is conserved .",
    "indeed , the energy of self - similar part of the solution at time @xmath86 ( @xmath80  -blowup time ) inside the past light cone of the point @xmath87 is equal to @xmath88 and vanishes as @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the system dynamics determined by the near - threshold initial data in the mentioned cauchy problem is a task of particular interest .",
    "in fact , solutions with various initial data approaching their corresponding threshold values could attain for a while ( prior to attain @xmath85 self - similar attractor ) some universal threshold configuration . in our case",
    "the @xmath2 static ymd solution is one of such threshold configurations that plays a role of an intermediate attractor .",
    "we discuss this in more details in the next section .",
    "this section , as well as the previous one , contains rather preparatory material to the next section .",
    "we would like to show that the @xmath2 static ymd solution of the system , , is a local intermediate attractor and it is also a threshold configuration separating blowup and scattering solutions . following the conventional methodology we assume an isolated compact distribution of matter ( ymd ) fields as an initial data in the cauchy problem , ,",
    ". further nonlinear evolution of the corresponding initially ingoing wave is a main subject of present section .    in this section",
    "we consider a compact distribution of ym field , determined by the function @xmath90 and by their partial derivatives at the initial slice @xmath91 .",
    "then the initial profile of the dilaton function @xmath92 is obtained by integration of the dilaton equation from the origin up to infinity assuming @xmath93 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the resulting value of the dilaton function at spatial infinity @xmath94 is a key parameter which defines the position of the virtual static ymd solutions in this scale .",
    "indeed , in order to study possible attaining static solutions one should plot all their virtual images at the same scale , i.e. with @xmath95 by using an appropriate shift of the dilaton function and the scale transformations .",
    "this was done for all simulations discussed below .    without loss of generality",
    "we assume two types of the initial ym profile described by the one - parametric kink - type and gauss - type distributions as follows : @xmath96\\ , , \\label{p1}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is fixed and free parameters @xmath98 , @xmath99 control the strength of the given initial data .    if the initial data are less than the threshold values in terms of @xmath100 , than the initially ingoing waves get smoothly bounced near the origin and are radiated away similarly to the solutions of linear wave equations .",
    "positions of various ym and dilaton profiles at the moment of bouncing are plotted in the figure 1 together with virtual images of the lowest @xmath101 static ymd solution at the appropriate scale .",
    "one can see that , as we are approaching the critical values of the parameters towards more strength initial data , the position of bounce is approaching from outside the virtual @xmath2 static ymd solution .",
    "dynamics of two various near - threshold solutions is presented on the figure 2 .",
    "behavior of the asymptotically scattered solution in a vicinity of the virtual @xmath2 static solution is presented in the left column of the figure 2 .",
    "one can see that initially purely ingoing wave attains the virtual static @xmath2 ymd solution for a while and after smooth bounce from it radiates away being transformed to the outgoing wave .",
    "if the relevant parameter in the initial profile slightly exceeds the threshold value one has a blowup as a final asymptotics .",
    "the behavior of the corresponding solution is presented in the right column of the figure 2 .",
    "the initially purely ingoing wave attains the virtual static @xmath2 ymd solution for a while too , and then starts to collapse , attaining later on the universal @xmath85 self - similar solution which is a blowup precursor .",

    "gradual change of the initial parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 in a small vicinity of their threshold values allows to minimize this integral over all range of the initial data parameters .",
    "the corresponding positions of the solution profiles ( plotted at the moment when the integral has a minimum ) converge to the limiting ( static ) threshold configuration separating asymptotically scattered and blowup solutions .",
    "it is not surprising that the @xmath2 static ymd solution is occurred to be a such limiting threshold configuration .",
    "this step - by - step shooting numerical strategy allows to approach the threshold value of the relevant parameter in the initial data with precision about @xmath103 .",
    "the mass - energy of the static intermediate attractor is an absolute lower bound for the mass - energy of all solutions of the ingoing wave type which could attain this attractor .",
    "this ( unreachable ) limit corresponds to the vanishing integral .",
    "hence , in order to have a chance to attain a static intermediate attractor , the mass - energy of the initial field configuration must exceed the mass - energy of the corresponding virtual static solution ( calculated at the appropriated scale determined by the @xmath104 ) which pretends to be an attractor . in this case a considerable part of the energy surplus should radiate away prior the solution attains the static attractor .",
    "the observed formation of an outgoing energy flux could serve as a useful numerical tool to resolve a possible attaindance to the intermediate attractor .",
    "the bottom plots of the figure 2 illustrate this statement : the negatively defined parts of the radial momentum density function @xmath33 testify to occurrence of the outgoing energy fluxes which are formed prior the solutions attain the static @xmath2 intermediate attractor .    to summarize : at least for those solutions which temporary attain the virtual @xmath2 static ymd solution the last one plays a role of a local threshold configuration separating scattering and blowup solutions .",
    "this is an expected behavior for the supercritical systems admitting static solutions with one unstable eigenmode .",
    "note that this is the most clear case , since due to an evident transversality , a stable manifold of the @xmath2 static solution has codimension @xmath105 . under the circumstances it was possible to observe convergence to the @xmath2 static threshold configuration starting with the arbitrary chosen simple kink - type or gauss - type initial data at spatial infinity .",
    "situation becomes more complicated if we consider higher static ymd solutions with @xmath6 which have more than one unstable eigenmodes .",
    "stable manifold of these solutions with the @xmath6 has codimension  @xmath106 as well and in this case , for a number of reasons , it is difficult to create initial data at spatial infinity which could control ( by the fine tuning of the governing parameters ) the possible attaindance to the higher @xmath6 static solutions pretending to be distinct threshold configurations .    instead",
    ", it is reasonable to start directly with this unstable static solutions and study their decay via unstable eigenmodes excitation .",
    "the role of various negative eigenmodes studied from the viewpoint of blowup / scattering alternative is a main task of this paper and is considered in the next section .",
    "we consider the coupled system of the ymd nonlinear wave equations with the boundary conditions , .",

    ", we put free boundary condition for the dilaton function at the origin @xmath122 . at the same time",
    "we keep the value of the dilaton fixed at infinity equal to its initial value @xmath123 that provides the same scale during the evolution .    using the normalization condition for the unstable eigenfunctions",
    "@xmath107 @xcite one can obtain a useful formula for the mass - energy shift caused by adding eigenfunctions @xmath107 to the background static solutions in accordance with @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the mass - energy of the corresponding static solution @xmath59 and @xmath61 is a free small parameter . as we will see below",
    ", the sign of the free small parameter @xmath61 plays a key role for the late - time solution asymptotics .",

    "it was shown that such waves propagate in both radial directions as a whole without energy dispersion .    following the bizon - tabor conjecture @xcite , we believe that singularity formation key properties are not specific features of definite nonlinear evolution equation , but rather are universal characteristics of a criticality class which this equation belongs to . in this way the results obtained for blowup can be valid as well for all supercritical systems of the same type and can shed new light on the old problems inspired , in particular , by the last decade studies of black hole formation as a result of the collapse of massless matter fields .",
    "let us remind that if gravity is included , say in the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) system of spherically symmetric equations @xcite , a smallest black hole mass formed in type - i gravitational collapse occurs to be exactly equal to the mass of the lowest unstable @xmath2 bartnick - mckinnon ( bk ) solution .",
    "it is possible to take for granted that @xmath2 bk solution is a local threshold configuration which separates dispersing and collapsing solutions .",
    "thus , the smallest black hole in type - i collapse is formed if the unique unstable eigenmode of @xmath2 bk solution is excited with an appropriate sign of @xmath61 in a limiting case as @xmath140 .",
    "if these statements are accepted , then a natural question arises of why all matter which forms @xmath2 bk solution appears inside black hole event horizon and no any outgoing energy flux is produced .",
    "in fact , tales of outgoing pulses formed due to backscattering of ingoing collapsing waves on a space - time curvature are most general and universal sources of information about collapse details for a distant observer .",
    "in addition to this a various basic processes inside black holes , such as a mass inflation @xcite , @xcite phenomenon , are also inspired by the backscattering of ingoing matter pulses . in the case under consideration",
    "an absence of such outgoing energy flux during @xmath2 bk solution decay is very unusual and interesting .    on the basis of the obtained conclusions",
    ", we believe that any supercritical system ( with gravity included or not ) has similar origin of this phenomenon .",
    "as we have shown , decay of the lowest static solution in ymd system via its single unstable eigenmode excitation produces exceptional nonlinear soliton - like wave , which can propagate in both radial directions as a whole without backscattering of the energy . accepting the universality conjecture it is possible to assume that similar soliton - like wave is formed in einstein - yang - mills system that naturally explains the equality of the smallest black hole mass to the mass of the @xmath2 bk solution .",
    "we plan to study soliton - like behavior of such solutions in more detail in a separate paper .    on the other hand ,",
    "the collapse decay of higher @xmath6 static unstable solutions is always accompanied by some energy flux to spatial infinity .",
    "thus , the question about lower bound of mass - energy kink , attaining some distinct @xmath6 static threshold configuration prior to blowup , is more subtle .",
    "we plan to consider this problem separately as well .",
