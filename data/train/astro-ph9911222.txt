    "from 1994 to 1995 , during the time of the gregorian dome upgrade at the arecibo observatory , while the telescope had limited steerability due to construction , a joint effort by several collaborations was aimed at surveying the sky visible from arecibo ( declination range roughly -1@xmath0 to 39@xmath0 ) in search of new pulsars .",
    "a total of 44 pulsars including 5 msps have been discovered so far by the other institutions ( foster et al .",

    "our search has an estimated sensitivity of 0.9 mjy at 7@xmath1 for long period , low dm , low zenith angle , high galactic latitude pulsars which is comparable to previous searches . in december 1997",
    "we confirmed the presence of 3 new pulsars : j0030 + 0451 ( 4.8ms ) , j0711 + 09 ( 2.4s ) , and j1313 + 09 ( 0.85s ) at the arecibo observatory using the arecibo berkeley pulsar processor and the penn state pulsar machine ( backer et al .",

    "the data were cross correlated with a template , and the resulting toas analyzed using the tempo program ( taylor & weisberg 1989 ) .",

    "a pulsar displaying an interpulse like psr j0030 + 0451 has two distinct possible geometries : nearly aligned , with the interpulse resulting from the second crossing of a wide - angle hollow  cone \" of radiation , or orthogonal , with the two emission regions coming from opposite poles .",
    "we performed a dual frequency morphological study of the intensity profile to look for clues to the geometry of the system .",
    "figure 1 depicts the gaussian decomposition of the profile at each frequency , with the corresponding gaussian parameters shown in table 2 ( kramer et al .",
    "1994 , kramer 1994 ) .",
    "conal emission is suggested by the narrowness of the 1400 mhz model compared to the 430 mhz data ( panel b overlays the two ) .",
    "in addition , the amplitudes of the gaussian components suggest that possibly all but component 2 are steep spectral index peaks , which may indicate that component 2 is a core component , and the rest are cone components .",
    "the polarization data do not settle the question of whether the geometry is orthogonal or nearly aligned .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of each .",

    "these objects present a unique problem in the standard evolutionary scenario of msps . if the neutron star is spun up via accretion by a mass transfer from a companion star , the companion must somehow be obliterated .",
    "i d like to thank the loc for their financial support and for a wonderful conference ! many thanks to michael kramer for timing observations from the mpifr 100-m telescope and for the use of his gaussian fitting program , alex wolszczan for use of the penn state pulsar processor , and kiriaki xilouris and duncan lorimer for extensive assistance in observations ."
