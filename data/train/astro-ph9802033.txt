    "three observational techniques have been used to probe changes in the merger rate as a function of cosmic epoch .",
    "these are ( a ) studies of angular and physical correlation functions , ( b ) pair counts , and ( c ) morphological studies . the advantages ( @xmath0 ) and disadvantages ( @xmath1 ) of each of these approaches for studying high - redshift mergers can be crudely summarized as follows .",
    "@xmath0    a close connection to large - scale structure work via the clustering statistics @xmath2 and @xmath3 . since mergers can be identified as the end - products of large - scale clustering , changes in the correlation function at small radius provide a conceptual link between the large - scale and small - scale regimes being probed with the same statistics .",
    "biases inherent in measuring correlation functions are fairly well - understood .",
    "@xmath1    measurement of correlation functions is best suited to large samples .",
    "these statistics are hard to measure at small radii , particularly when galactic components ( such as giant hii regions ) become difficult to distinguish from merging companions .",
    "this is often the case when probing distant galaxies in the rest - frame ultraviolet , _ eg .",
    "_ in the hubble deep field , where knots of star - formation can not easily be distinguished from companions ( colley et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "_ not really measuring merger rate ( see below ) _",
    "@xmath0    simple statistics to measure ( described in detail in the next section ) .",
    "conceptually the pair - counts approach is an integration over the two - point correlation function , with better signal - to - noise properties at small radii , so the biases are also fairly well - understood .",
    "@xmath1    like correlation functions , the statistic becomes ambiguous when merging companions become indistinguishable from galactic components .",
    "_ not really measuring merger rate ( see below ) _",
    "the most important criticism common to both the correlation function and pair counts approaches is that neither provides a direct measure of the merger rate .",
    "the fundamental difficulty is _ the uncertain physical timescale over which merging occurs _ , given physical proximity between galaxies .",
    "both statistics probe the fuel `` reservoir '' available for close gravitational interaction , but what we really seek is an understanding of the rate at which the merger `` engine '' operates in converting these galaxies into the by - products of mergers . to understand this",
    ", one must observe the mergers in progress .",
    "so the third approach must necessarily be a morphological one :      @xmath0    direct observation of _ mergers in progress _",
    "@xmath1    poorly - understood biases ( _ eg .",
    "_ morphological k - corrections )    because of space limitations , and because they are well - reviewed elsewhere , this review ignores studies of the correlation function ( eg .",

    "1997 ) , and touches only rather superficially on recent studies on pair - counts in  2 , in order to focus mostly on summarizing very recent progress made on morphological studies at high - redshift with hst in  3 .",
    "because existing redshift surveys are not yet deep enough to allow a direct analysis of pair - density evolution to be undertaken , pair count studies can be broadly grouped into two categories : ( 1 ) pure photometric analyses with no redshift information , and ( 2 ) photometric searches around galaxies with known redshifts .",
    "a flavor for the methodology adopted in the latter `` mixed '' category of redshift - photometric surveys is sketched out in figure 1 , which illustrates the technique adopted by yee & ellingson ( 1995 ) .",
    "searches are conducted within an aperture projected onto the sky , defined by a projected _ physical _ radius of @xmath4 kpc of a galaxy of known redshift .",
    "but because low - redshift galaxies will have a large search radius that is likely to be littered with faint unrelated background galaxies , additional restrictions must be placed on the search radius based on the apparent magnitude of the putative companion galaxy .",
    "each companion must lie within a radius @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the expected nearest neighbor distance for galaxies brighter than companion magnitude @xmath7 .",
    "( @xmath8 ( rose 1977 ) , where @xmath9 is the surface density of galaxies brighter than @xmath7 . ) a correction can then be made for the expected mean number of unrelated galaxies in the search area , assuming poisson statistics : @xmath10 $ ]    results from all published surveys of pair - density evolution ( from both classes of survey ) are summarized below , in the form of power - law evolution in the density of pairs",

    "convincing observations of high - redshift galaxy morphology have only become possible recently , with wf / pc2 observations on hst , and the resulting flood of imaging data has resulted in a great increase in our understanding of the field galaxy population at high redshifts . selected highlights ( with apologies to many colleagues",
    "whose work can not be included here due to space limitations ) from recent hst - based imaging work , relevant to high - redshift mergers , are summarized below .",
    "i then go on to describe what seem to me a number of `` key issues '' with regard to understanding the connection between these imaging observations and high - redshift merger scenarios .",
    "early work from the medium deep survey ( mds ) reported an excess of faint peculiar systems ( griffiths  et  al .",

    "driver  et  al .  1995 ; abraham  et  al  1996 ) .",
    "worries with regard to bulk misclassification of peculiar galaxies have been eased by the incorporation of objective machine - based classifications , which are now routinely being used to supplement ( and in some cases replace ) visual morphological classifications from a number of different surveys ( abraham  et  al .",
    "1996 ; odewahan  et  al .  1996 ;",
    "naim  et  al .  1997 ; brinchmann et al .",
    "the incorporation of redshift information , probing the regime out to roughly @xmath23 , has generally confirmed the photometric work , and in turn pushed much further in terms of our understanding of the contributions of the morphological classes to the star - formation history of the universe ( cowie ,  hu ,  &  songaila  1995 ; schade et al .",
    "1996 ; pascarelle et al .",
    "1996 ; brinchmann et al .",
    "imaging follow - up observations of lyman - limit systems have in turn yielded views of systems at @xmath24 ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1996 ) . because of their unprecedented depth , and intensive spectroscopic and photometric redshift follow - ups ( cohen et al . 1996",
    "; lanzetta et al . 1996 ; mobasher et al . 1996 ; lowenthal et al . 1997 ; phillips et al . 1997 ; sawicki et al . 1997 ) , hubble deep field observation of faint galaxy morphology are the likely to yield the greatest insights into evolving distribution of morphological types at high redshifts for some time to come ( abraham et al . 1996 ; van den bergh et al . 1996 ; bouwens et al . 1997 ; guzman et al .",
    "eagerly anticipated are the results from high - resolution infrared observations in the hdf with nicmos , and forthcoming observations of the hdf south . deeper observations ( and , perhaps more importantly , greater sky coverage ) will perhaps have to await completion of the hst advanced camera , and hopefully ngst .",
    "while recent work has left little doubt that much of the high - redshift universe is morphologically peculiar ( about 1/3 of all galaxies by @xmath25 mag ) , the nature of these systems is currently unknown . in the context of the present meeting",
    ", the bottom - line question seems to be : what fraction of morphologically peculiar galaxies are mergers in progress ?",
    "unfortunately this question can not be answered at the present time .",
    "part of the problem is simply one of subjective and confusing taxonomy used to describe the morphologies of faint galaxies .",
    "for example , are `` morphologically peculiar '' ( griffiths et al .",
    "1994 ) , `` chainlike '' ( cowie , hu , & songaila 1995 ) , `` blue nucleated '' ( schade et al .",
    "1996 ) , `` irregular / peculiar / merger '' ( glazebrook et al . 1995 ; abraham et al .",
    "1996a , b ; brinchmann et al 1997 ) , and `` tadpole '' ( van den bergh et al . 1996 ) galaxies similar objects simply denoted by different names , or a true reflection in the diversity of the morphologies of galaxies in the distant universe ? at a more mundane level , is bandshifting of the rest - frame of observation ( the so - called `` morphological k - correction '' ) playing an important role , by fooling us into mistaking systems with normal uv morphology for new classes of galaxy ?",
    "i have argued ( abraham et al .",
    "1996a;b ) that problems with both taxonomy and morphological k - corrections can be circumvented by abandoning conventional galaxy classification schemes in favor of objective classifications , based on measurement of simple structural parameters ( such central concentration and asymmetry ) , and by calibrating such measurements against simulations of the appearance of galaxies at a range of redshifts .",
    "the best example of this approach is recent work by brinchmann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in this work , hst imaging and ground - based spectroscopic data for @xmath26 galaxies with good completeness to @xmath27 mag are used demonstrate that the peculiar galaxy excess is already in place at redshifts where morphological k - corrections have a minimal effect .",
    "simple and objective approaches to quantifying galaxy morphology seems to me the safest course until the observational biases are better understood , but of course one pays a price by `` smoothing over '' much of the interesting diversity ( denoted with correspondingly charming nomenclature ) seen in galaxy forms on deep images .",
    "what fraction of this diverse set of peculiar galaxies are actually mergers in progress ?",
    "the problems inherent in answering this question are illustrated in figure 3 , which shows candidate lyman limit systems in the hubble deep field with @xmath28 mag .",
    "obviously most are morphologically peculiar , but how many readers can honestly claim that these resemble the appearance of local merging systems ? the difficulties inherent in identifying mergers amongst the distant morphologically peculiar population are made clear by simulations recently published by hibbard and vacca ( 1997 ) , who use hst wf / pc camera ultraviolet data to predict the appearance of the high - redshift counterparts to local merging starburst systems . because the usual signatures of mergers ( tidal tails , distorted disks ) are no longer visible at high redshifts , merging starbursts seem to provide at least qualitatively reasonable counterparts to many faint peculiar galaxies ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "while very suggestive , such simulations need to be interpreted with some caution , because they do not explicitly account for evolutionary effects which are known to be important at high redshifts .",
    "for example , in the simulations shown in fig .",
    "4 the smooth components of the galaxy are invisible largely because their stellar populations are evolved in the local reference images and are subject to strong k - corrections .",
    "however at @xmath29 _ all _ stellar populations are relatively young .",
    "more detailed simulations incorporating explicitly the effects of evolution would be valuable .    clearly the best way forward will be to incorporate dynamical information to determine directly which peculiar galaxies show distinct kinematical sub - components .",
    "unfortunately these observations are not currently feasible , although they may soon become possible with adaptive optics and the new generation of 8m - class telescopes . in the meantime , a promising approach to quantifying the fraction of mergers amongst the distant peculiar galaxy population may be to measure statistics which are relatively insensitive to image distortions resulting from bandshifting and surface - brightness biases , but which track probable merger activity .",
    "one such statistic is the `` lee ratio '' , a measure of image bimodality .",
    "this statistic been applied to images of galaxies in the cfrs survey ( fig .",
    "5 ) and to hdf galaxies , with the result that around @xmath30 of faint peculiar systems are significantly bimodal , with an @xmath31 increase in the merger rate ( le fvre et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "another promising approach to quantifying the fraction of high - redshift mergers is to better understand the nature of the star - formation activity in distant peculiar galaxies , in order to test if their star - formation histories are consistent with merging .",
    "one overlooked method for accomplishing this is modelling of the _ internal _ pixel - by - pixel colors of these galaxies .",
    "this approach splits the galaxy up into components under the assumption that morphology can be used to identify stellar populations . in principle , this breaks much of the degeneracy inherent in population synthesis modelling which treat galaxies as point sources , and puts constraints not only on merger activity , but also on the dust content , relative ages of disk and bulge , and general star - formation history . as an example ,",
    "figure  5 shows two `` chain galaxies '' in the hubble deep field .",
    "the resolved color analysis indicates that these systems are showing well - organized star - formation activity  a strong constraint on possible merging scenarios .",
    "the `` knots '' in these galaxies are unlikely to be individual galaxies ; star - formation seems to be triggered linearly along the body of the galaxy , starting from a initial `` seed '' starburst , with individual knots that are about as luminous as `` super star clusters '' that are the putative progenitors of globular clusters .",
    "if such systems are mergers in progress then a mechanism for igniting the chain reaction via mergers must be invoked .",
    "work is currently in progress ( abraham et al . 1998 ) to apply these ideas to all peculiar galaxies in the hdf in order to determine which galaxies are the strongest merger candidates .",
    "until kinematical studies become available with resolution sufficient to detect merging subsystems at high redshifts , color - based studies may be the best way to detect distinct physical sub - components in morphologically peculiar galaxies .",
    "the most recent pair - count analyses seem to suggest that the fraction of physical pairs grows as @xmath31 . however , the conversion between pair fraction and merger rate is uncertain , and the pair count work so far published is limited to fairly low redshifts ( @xmath32 ) . at higher redshifts morphological",
    "work with hst indicates that by @xmath33 mag something over 30% of all galaxies are morphologically peculiar .",
    "simulations and follow - up spectroscopic work suggest this excess in morphologically peculiar systems is a physical effect , and not merely the result of `` morphological k - corrections '' .",
    "the fraction of mergers amongst these morphologically peculiar galaxies is unknown , because obviously merging local systems , such as nearby major starburst galaxies , no longer appear like conventional mergers at high redshifts . a preliminary analysis of image bimodality ( a robust parameter that in principle flags major mergers even at high redshift ) amongst @xmath27 mag peculiar systems with @xmath23 suggests that around 40% the morphologically peculiar galaxies are strongly bimodal , and thus probably merging",
    "this is consistent with a merger rate increases of @xmath31 .",
    "internal color analyses of morphologically peculiar systems is an interesting next step in probing high - redshift mergers , leading ultimately to kinematical investigations in the next few years .",
    "i thank my collaborators richard ellis , nial tanvir , sidney van den bergh , karl glazebrook , andy fabian , and basilio santiago for their contributions to our high - redshift morphology projects .",
