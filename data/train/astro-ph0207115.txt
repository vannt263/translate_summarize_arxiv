    "last years the technique of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) has proved to be an effective tool to register cosmic @xmath0-rays in the energy region above 100  gev @xcite . in comparison to the satellite experiments this technique provides as much as a few magnitudes larger detection area .",
    "compared to the particle detector arrays it comprises a low energy threshold of detected air showers .",
    "in addition , iact arrays ( like hegra @xcite , hess @xcite or veritas @xcite ) provide the ability of accurate reconstruction of air shower parameters such as the arrival direction , the core location and the primary energy _ both _ for @xmath0-ray and cosmic ray ( cr ) induced air showers .",
    "all this makes it attractive to apply the iact technique for the study of the cr mass composition .    in @xcite",
    "an approach was developed allowing to use the iacts for study of the chemical composition of crs in the primary energy region @xmath71  tev / nucleus .",
    "later this approach received an application in the analysis of the observational data of the hegra collaboration ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this study",
    "we also discuss possibilities of application of the iact technique for an analysis of the cr mass composition .",
    "however , on the contrary to @xcite , we analyse here higher primary energies , i.e. the energy interval between a few dozen tev / nucleus and the `` knee '' region where the energy spectrum steepens from differential spectral index @xmath8 below @xmath9 pev to @xmath10 above ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this energy region becomes important for ground based observations hence the balloon and satellite born experiments run out of statistics here .",
    "the region around the `` knee '' is of special interest , because in all likelihood it contains contributions of different types of cr sources .",
    "presumably this could be the case when the contribution to cr population made by the supernovae remnants of the galaxy changes for sources of other origin ( see e.g. ref .",
    "different types of sources and a rather smooth energy dependence in the `` knee '' region combined with the varying properties of interstellar medium permits sufficient freedom in selection of alternative acceleration models .",
    "in such a circumstance it is important to develop new methods enabling an accurate determination of cr chemical composition and capable of reconstructing the structure of energy spectra in the `` knee '' region for individual cr nucleus groups .",
    "a new approach to the analysis of the cr mass composition developed in this study is based on a special kind of iact array consisting of telescopes separated by distances considerably larger than for traditional iact systems and equipped by multichannel cameras with a wide field of view - ray sources in the multi - tev energy region was first suggested in @xcite . ] .",
    "we show that such an array could provide a huge detection area ( up to several km@xmath2 ) and , thus , could extend an interval of observed primary energies up to the `` knee '' region .",
    "a detailed study is undertaken to estimate the possibility of the array to measure the energy of individual air showers and to separate showers induced by different primary nuclei in the `` event by event '' mode , which is the natural way of data analysis for stereoscopic iact observations .",
    "besides , such an approach , being a realization of the so - called non parametric analysis @xcite , yields not only an estimate of the primary energy and mass composition , but also allows to specify the uncertainty of the results in a quantitative way .",
    "all results presented in this paper have been obtained by means of the altai simulation code @xcite developed particularly for the simulations of cherenkov light emission produced by @xmath0-ray and proton / nuclei - induced air showers .",
    "being essentially less time consuming than the corsika code @xcite , altai well reproduces experimental data obtained by the hegra and whipple collaborations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "air showers created by four different types of primaries ( protons , @xmath11-particles , oxygen and iron nuclei ) have been considered for the primary energy region up to @xmath12  tev / nucleus .",
    "we carried out our simulations for a system of iacts located at the corners of a square considering different values of the square side length @xmath13 .",
    "the optical axes of the iacts were assumed to be parallel to each other and vertically directed .",
    "following @xcite we consider this system of iacts as a cell of an iact array consisting of a large number of cells ( @xmath14 ) and having a detection area @xmath15 . in this relation",
    ", we assume that the core of air showers registered by the cell is uniformly distributed inside the cell square , this assumption is valid for an overwhelming majority of registered air showers . ] .",
    "the iact considered in our analysis has a modest mirror size ( 10 m@xmath2 ) and an ordinary value ( @xmath160.1 ) of the cherenkov photon / photoelectron conversion factor .",
    "a number of hexagonal configurations of the multichannel camera has been considered for this telescope with the field of view ( fov ) up to @xmath17 .",
    "two values of the camera pixel size ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) have been studied .",
    "we assume that the cell registers air showers triggering simultaneously at least two of its telescopes and apply the following condition to simulate the hardware trigger of an individual telescope : at least two adjacent pixel magnitudes of the central part of the camera ( with @xmath20 pixels ) should exceed a given value @xmath21 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath21 is determined by the night sky light contribution , the value of parameter @xmath20 and the number ( @xmath22 ) of telescopes triggered simultaneously ( see for details @xcite ) . in the case of",
    "@xmath23 we have @xmath24 photoelectrons for @xmath25 and @xmath26  ph.e . for @xmath27 .    to estimate the iact detection rate one needs an input about the cr energy spectra .",
    "strictly speaking , these spectra differ from each other for different nucleus groups ( see e.g. ref .",
    "we neglect for simplicity this difference and assume that cr nucleus groups give an energy - independent contribution to the all - particle cr flux @xmath28 the data on this contribution are presented in table  [ assumed ] .",
    "each value given in the table is the proportion of the respective nuclei group in the all - particle flux .",
    ".the assumed chemical composition of primary cosmic rays . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ efviae ]",
    "we suggest a new approach to study the mass composition of cosmic rays in the energy region from several dozen tev / nucleus up to the knee region , i.e. up to a few pev / nucleus , using an array of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes with an architecture sufficiently different from traditional iact systems ( like hegra , hess or veritas ) .",
    "this array consists of imaging telescopes with a relatively small mirror size ( @xmath16 10 m@xmath2 ) separated from each other by large distances ( @xmath16500  m ) and equipped by multichannel cameras with a modest pixel size ( @xmath4 ) and a rather large viewing angle ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a square cell consisting of four telescopes is used to investigate basic properties of the array .",
    "it is shown that the cell provides considerably more effective detection of air showers initiated by heavy nuclei compared with the traditional iact systems .",
    "for example , the proportion of nuclei with the charge number @xmath29 in the cell detection rate is ( @xmath16 15% ) , whereas for traditional systems this proportion is less than 5%",
    ".    it is found that the approach considered here could provide a precise determination of primary energy of air showers .",
    "its energy resolution is within 25 - 35% and depends only weakly on the air shower energy and the atomic number of primary nucleus .    to separate air showers created by different primary nuclei with the iact technique one",
    "needs image parameters sensitive to the variation of the nucleus atomic number .",
    "we show in this study that a number of image parameters exhibits such a sensitivity .",
    "the @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 parameters are the most effective ones .",
    "an effective technique exploiting a criterion similar to the distance in multiparameter space has been developed to classify air showers detected by the cell on the basis of differences in the image parameters .",
    "this technique allows to enrich the residual detection rate of the cell ( which includes events satisfying to the selection criteria ) up to 90% of air showers belonging to the nucleus group assigned for selection saving about 15 - 20% of these showers .",
    "the technique considered here could provide us with a sufficiently good statistics of observations everywhere in the energy region 30 - 1000  tev .",
    "for example , an iact array with a modest number of cells ( 16 ) could provide detection in the energy region above @xmath33  tev about 2000 nuclei with @xmath29 for a modest observation time ( 100  h ) .",
    "this number is considerably greater than the total number of such nuclei have been accumulated until now in the balloon and satellite born experiments .",
    "not having the ability of precise measurement of the primary particle mass as in satellite or balloon borne experiments , the proposed system nevertheless comprises capability of separation of primaries owing to which it could be an instrument complementary to ground - based particle detectors . to have confident results the number of predefined nuclei groups in ground - based experiments is typically limited to 2 - 3 for the cases of event by event analysis ( hegra  @xcite , kascade @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the higher numbers are available only for techniques utilizing the information on the registered spectra of secondaries ( four groups reported in  @xcite ) . according to @xcite and @xcite",
    "the proposed system would deliver the rather higher efficiency of proton selection than that for the hegra and the kascade for the time being .",
    "for the first project the purity @xmath34 for ( p , he ) nuclei group at @xmath35 is reported . in our case",
    "such a value of @xmath36 yields @xmath37 for protons only , thus successfully rejecting group of he nucleus which comprises @xmath38 of the ( p , he ) group . for the kascade",
    "@xmath39 corresponds to @xmath40 . only for protons",
    "our approach yields @xmath41 .",
    "comparison of our data on selection of hvh group with that for the kascade ( @xcite and @xcite ) shows that the proposed system is inferior to the kascade unless @xmath42 . at the same time for hvh and lm groups the selection capabilities of the kascade deteriorates with the decrease of primary energy @xcite so that our approach would benefit in the sub - knee energy region",
