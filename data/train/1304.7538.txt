    "many galaxies with active star formation in their central regions have large - scale galactic winds .",
    "these are thought to be responsible for circulating enriched gas to the halo of their host galaxy and even to the intergalactic medium .",
    "the galaxy m82 has not only hot , ionized gas in its outflow , but also cool h@xmath4 emitting filaments @xcite , and cold molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simulations of starburst winds have shown that dense , molecular gas may be entrained in outflowing winds producing cold clouds and filaments at high latitudes around the center of a galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    there is increasing evidence that the milky way may also have a large - scale nuclear wind .",
    "@xcite linked the galactic center lobe and north polar spur to a bipolar wind traced by infrared emission in the inner @xmath5 of the galaxy . in gamma - ray emission",
    "there are two very large lobes extending to @xmath6 , centered on the galactic center @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite identified counterparts to the fermi bubbles in radio polarized emission and suggested that the lobes are formed through the effects of massive star formation , which drives a galactic wind at @xmath7 @xmath1 .",
    "there are few direct tracers of the velocity of the putative nuclear wind of the milky way , and little evidence of associated cold gas .",
    "in fact , the inner 3 kpc of the milky way shows a distinct lack of diffuse h  i  at @xmath8 pc , which @xcite attributed to a galactic wind removing h  i  except in the narrow disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most convincing kinematic information comes from @xcite who found high velocity uv absorption along two sight - lines indicating a maximum outflow velocity of 250 @xmath1 .",
    "we have discovered a population of compact , isolated clouds in the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) h  i  galactic center survey that may trace neutral gas in a wind .",
    "the atca h  i  galactic center survey @xcite covers galactic longitudes @xmath9 , and galactic latitude @xmath10 over the velocity range @xmath11 @xmath1  with a velocity resolution of 1 @xmath1 , an angular resolution of @xmath12 and a mean rms h  ibrightness temperature of @xmath13 k.    in the atca survey data for the central @xmath14 of the galaxy there is a population of compact h  iclouds that are isolated both spatially and in velocity from the bulk of galactic h  i  emission",
    ". clouds were selected to be relatively compact ( @xmath15 ) , discrete from other emission , and with brightness temperatures greater than @xmath16 over more than five spectral channels . typically the clouds are only just spatially resolved . however , there are some more extended filamentary features , which we also refer to generally as clouds .",
    "example clouds are shown in figure [ fig : example ] . we have found a total of 86 clouds between @xmath17 .",
    "for each cloud we measure the central velocity , @xmath18 , fitted peak brightness temperature after baseline removal , @xmath19 , velocity full - width half - max @xmath20 , mean radius , @xmath21 , assuming a distance of @xmath22 kpc , peak column density , @xmath23 , and cloud mass , @xmath24 .",
    "the cloud properties are given in table  [ tab : catalogue ] . the mean radius , @xmath25 , is calculated from the area of the cloud , @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is the number of pixels in the integrated intensity image with @xmath27 .",
    "this is clearly a very rough estimate as many clouds are not well represented by an ellipse .",
    "the h  i  masses are calculated as the sum of all pixels greater than @xmath28% @xmath23 assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc .",
    "we quote h  i  masses assuming the gas is optically thin .",
    "the full width half max of the h  i  line ( fwhm ) is shown in figure  [ fig : histos ] , along with histograms of mass , radius and column density for these clouds .",
    "the median , minimum and maximum values for the population are given in table [ tab : props ] .",
    "there are no strong correlations of cloud radius , fwhm or mass with @xmath29 height .",
    "the median line width corresponds to @xmath30 k. assuming that the unresolved clouds are roughly spherical we estimate an average h  i  number density , @xmath31 .",
    "there are several larger features , such as the loop at @xmath32 ) ( figure [ fig : example]d ) , which appear to cohesive over many degrees .",
    "these features have also larger velocity widths and velocity gradients .",
    "the @xmath33 ) loop is particularly interesting because it appears to point directly back to the galactic center .",
    "the location of the clouds , color - coded by their lsr velocities , is shown in figure  [ fig : dist]a .",
    "the clouds clearly do not follow galactic rotation .",

    "the velocity terms @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the radial , azimuthal and vertical velocities . in circular",
    "galactic rotation @xmath37 and @xmath39 are zero and the @xmath40 term produces a change in sign of @xmath18 across @xmath41 .",
    "the absence of this signature in the cloud distribution suggests that the kinematics of the clouds are not dominated by circular galactic rotation . because the clouds are at high velocities and do not show the signature of galactic rotation we assume that the clouds are located at the galactic center .",
    "clouds above the galactic plane have predominantly positive velocities while clouds below the galactic plane have predominantly negative velocities . above the plane",
    "there are 16 clouds at negative velocities and 29 clouds at positive velocities .",
    "below the plane there are 28 clouds at negative velocities and 13 clouds at positive velocities .",
    "the mean lsr velocity at positive latitudes is @xmath42 @xmath1  and the mean velocity at negative latitudes is @xmath43 @xmath1 .",
    "this is unlikely to be the effect of the @xmath39 term in equation 1 , as @xmath44 is very small and would require @xmath39 values of @xmath45 @xmath1  to explain the observed range of lsr velocities .",
    "this kinematic asymmetry is likely a product of confusion with unrelated h  i  emission , which effects our ability to find isolated clouds .",
    "it is well known that most of the h  i  emission around the galactic center at @xmath46 @xmath1  is at @xmath47 and @xmath48 and similarly the emission at @xmath49 @xmath1  is at @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( burton & liszt 1978 , see also figure 4 of mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "consequently , we are not likely to find many high velocity clouds isolated in @xmath52-@xmath53-@xmath54 space with positive velocities at @xmath48 or with negative velocities at @xmath51 .      to understand the selection effects on the distribution of observed cloud velocities we have simulated clouds in an outflowing wind .",
    "we have populated the interior of two cones having an opening angle , @xmath4 , centered on the galactic center and extending to a height of 1.5 kpc with 1000 randomly distributed clouds .",
    "each cloud was assigned an lsr velocity based on its location , a constant conical wind of velocity , @xmath55 , and the expression similar to that derived by @xcite , correcting a typographical error in keeney et al . ]",

    "the second term is negative for objects on the near side of the galactic center and positive for objects on the far side of the galactic center from the sun .",
    "we assumed the iau standard @xmath59 kpc .",
    "each simulated cloud was compared to the h  i  actually detected in the atca survey at its @xmath52 and @xmath53 . if the cloud lay at a velocity where there was no significant h  i  emission ( @xmath60 ) it was assumed to have been `` detected '' .",
    "models covered wind velocities , @xmath55 , between 100 @xmath1  and 800 @xmath1 . wind velocities @xmath61 @xmath1  are unable to produce high velocity clouds as observed , whereas large wind velocities produce a cloud distribution whose mean velocity is higher than observed . using a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test , and separating the data into positive and negative latitude regions , we estimated the probability that the velocities of the observed clouds could be drawn from the same distribution as the simulated clouds .",
    "the k - s test @xmath62-values as a function of @xmath55 showed a peak near @xmath63 @xmath1  for positive latitudes and near @xmath64 @xmath1  for negative latitudes , but at a lower confidence level . for all @xmath55",
    "the simulated velocities were more consistent with the observed velocity distribution at positive latitudes than at negative latitudes . adopting a threshold of @xmath65",
    ", the k - s test implies that wind velocities greater than 270 @xmath1  and less than 150 @xmath1are not consistent with the observed cloud velocities .",
    "the observed cloud longitudes and latitudes set a lower limit on the cone opening angle , @xmath4 .",
    "values @xmath66 radians are too narrow to produce intermediate latitude ( @xmath67 ) clouds at @xmath68 .",
    "the upper limit to @xmath4 not well constrained as there is coupling between the angle and the assumed wind velocity .",
    "we experimented with several angles , including a fully spherical distribution , and found the results were best matched to @xmath69 radians .",
    "the resulting `` detected '' clouds for a wind velocity of @xmath70 @xmath1  and @xmath71 are shown in figure [ fig : dist]b . although the mean velocity of the initial distribution at both positive and negative latitudes was close to zero , because of the selection effects from blending with unrelated h  i  emission , the velocity distribution of the detected clouds shows the same preference for positive velocities at @xmath72 and negative velocities at @xmath73 observed in the real clouds . from 50 realizations of the simulation with @xmath74 @xmath1  we find mean and median positive latitude velocities of @xmath75 @xmath1  and @xmath76 @xmath1 , and mean and median negative latitude velocities of @xmath77 @xmath1 , and @xmath78 @xmath1 .",
    "the real data have mean and median values , respectively , of @xmath42 @xmath1  and @xmath79 @xmath1  at @xmath72 , and @xmath43 @xmath1  and @xmath80 @xmath1  at @xmath73 .",
    "the velocity discrepancies at negative latitudes may indicate a higher wind velocity below the galactic plane or a wind that does not point directly down .",
    "the simulation produces a large number of clouds at small longitudes ( @xmath81 ) and small velocities @xmath82 at all latitudes .",
    "these clouds are collimated along the wind axis perpendicular to the galactic plane . in most cases",
    "we expect these to be blended with unrelated low velocity h  i  emission",
    ". however , examining the observed h  i  data cube we do find significant structure collimated perpendicular to the galactic plane at @xmath81 with velocities @xmath83 .",
    "these features do not meet our criteria of being discrete from other emission and were therefore not catalogued , but may reasonably be part of the same wind structure .",
    "the simulation thus approximately reproduces some of the key features of the observed distribution .",
    "the observations are consistent with a outflowing conical wind of @xmath3 @xmath1 .",
    "we are also able to say with confidence that the observed velocity distribution of clouds with positive velocities at @xmath72 and negative velocities at @xmath73 is caused by confusion with unrelated h  i.",
    "the recent discovery of the fermi bubbles @xcite in @xmath84-ray emission and their apparent counterparts in polarized radio continuum @xcite has fueled speculation that there is either a powerful jet from the galactic center or there has been a past burst of star formation . in explaining the polarized radio continuum structure of the fermi bubbles ,",
    "@xcite argue that the bubbles are consistent with a past burst of star formation and confirm the @xcite estimate that the bubbles required an injection of @xmath85 .",
    "they estimate that the interiors of the fermi bubbles are filled with hot plasma of temperature @xmath86 k with a density , @xmath87 , traveling at a velocity of 1100 @xmath1 .    the median radius , column density and velocity width of the galactic center h  i  are very similar to the lower halo tangent point clouds identified by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that halo clouds are the remnants of supershells and superbubbles pushed beyond the galactic disk through the stellar winds and supernovae of massive stars , but remaining dynamically linked to the galactic disk .",
    "our galactic center clouds have higher velocities than the @xcite clouds .",
    "the formation mechanism for the galactic center clouds , which determines their dynamics , is therefore probably more energetic than for the halo clouds .",
    "this is not surprising , the star formation rate in the inner 100 pc of the galaxy is @xmath88 ( reviewed by * ? ? ? * ) , whereas the star formation rate at the end of the galactic bar where many halo clouds were found ( @xmath89 ) is @xmath90 @xcite .    in spite of the extreme star formation rate in the very active region of the galactic center and",
    "estimated high temperatures in the wind , cold clouds are not unexpected .",
    "simulations by @xcite of starburst driven galactic winds show compact clouds , filaments , and complex structures of density , @xmath91 and temperature , @xmath92 entrained in the inner 400 pc of a starburst wind .",
    "similarly , the @xcite simulations of the m82 wind produced a wealth of features at @xmath93 with sizes @xmath94 pc and densities in the range @xmath95 .",
    "the velocity of this cold phase of the outflow is typically 10 - 30% of the velocity of the hot phase , or 100 - 800 @xmath1 , for the @xcite and @xcite models .",
    "@xcite also found that in order for the wind to contain a rich filamentary structure of cool gas the starburst needed to occur over a relatively short timescale of a few million years .",
    "our wind velocity modeling produces a velocity of the cold component of the wind that is similar to that observed in the h@xmath4 emitting filaments of m82 @xcite and predicted by hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the velocity of the hot component using the relationship for the ratio of the terminal velocity of the cold clouds , @xmath96 , to the hot wind , @xmath97 , for a cloud of density , @xmath98 , in a wind of density , @xmath99 , @xcite @xmath100^{1/2}.\\ ] ] assuming @xmath101 @xmath1 , as derived in ",
    "[ subsec : simpop ] , we estimate the velocity of the hot wind as @xmath102 @xmath1 , which is consistent with the hot wind velocity of 1100 @xmath1  estimated by @xcite .    presuming that the clouds are launched from very near the galactic plane , to reach @xmath103 latitude in a @xmath3 @xmath1  wind takes at least 3 myr .",
    "if the clouds are entrained in a hot wind then they will be subject to a number of destructive effects .",
    "first , they will evaporate .",
    "the evaporation rate , @xmath104 , for an unmagnetized 15 pc cloud in a @xmath105 k plasma with a density of @xmath87 is @xmath106 , assuming saturated evaporation @xcite .",
    "this implies a typical survival time of a few @xmath107 , which is less than the time for a cloud to reach a @xmath29 height of 400 pc in a @xmath108 @xmath1  wind .",
    "however , the evaporation timescale is highly sensitive ( @xmath109 ) to the assumed temperature of the plasma surrounding the clouds .",
    "hydrodynamic models of winds show that the temperature may be anywhere in the range @xmath110 k , it therefore seems possible that the clouds could survive for up to @xmath111 myr . also important to the clouds lifetimes",
    "are the cloud crushing time , due to the wind shock , and the cloud cooling time .",
    "the relative timescales for these two effects gives an estimate of whether the cold , dense clouds would be protected by an enveloping radiative shock @xcite .",
    "the cooling time for a cloud of density @xmath98 of shocked temperature @xmath112 is on the order of a few hundred years .",
    "this is much less than the cloud crushing time , @xmath113 @xcite , which suggests that a cloud could survive for some time in the hot wind .",
    "the total mass of h  i  in the observed clouds is only @xmath114 .",
    "the mass loss rate , assuming the oldest cloud is @xmath115 myr , is @xmath116 . at this rate",
    "it is unlikely that this outflow will have a significant impact on the @xmath117 reservoir of cold gas estimated for the 100 pc ring in the central molecular zone @xcite .",
    "we estimate the work required to accelerate these clouds to their current velocities ; for a @xmath118 cloud traveling at @xmath119 , the kinetic energy is @xmath120 , and the kinetic energy of the most massive cloud in our sample is @xmath121 . the total estimated kinetic energy for all clouds traveling at a velocity of @xmath108 @xmath1",
    "is @xmath122 ergs . assuming the ratio of ratio of kinetic energy of the h  i  clouds to the total input wind energy is @xmath123 @xcite , as often assumed for superbubbles , the required wind energy input was @xmath124 ergs over the past @xmath125 yrs .",
    "the wind luminosity is therefore @xmath126 , which is easily supplied through supernovae and stellar winds in the gc region with a star formation rate of @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "we have identified a population of compact , cool , @xmath128 k , h  iclouds around the galactic center . although physically similar in terms of size , temperature and column density to other cold h  iclouds in the lower halo of the galaxy , the galactic center h  iclouds have unique kinematics and do not follow galactic rotation .",
    "we suggest that these clouds are associated with a wind from the galactic center and are the remnants of cold , dense gas entrained in the outflowing wind .",
    "using a simple model for a galactic wind with a velocity of @xmath3 @xmath1  we are able to roughly reproduce the observed velocity distribution of the clouds .",
    "this value , and hydrodynamic simulations of a starburst wind , which find that the velocity of the cold phase gas is 10 - 30% of the velocity of the hot phase @xcite , the hot wind emanating from the milky way s center must have a velocity of @xmath129 @xmath1 .",
    "we estimate the luminosity required to drive the clouds is @xmath130 , which is easily supplied by stellar winds and supernovae in the galactic center region over the past @xmath131 years .",
