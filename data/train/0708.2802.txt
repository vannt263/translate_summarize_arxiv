    "nonvanishing neutrino magnetic moment leads to various chirality - flipping processes where the left - handed neutrinos produced in the stellar interior become the right - handed ones , i.e. sterile with respect to the weak interaction .",
    "a considerable interest to the neutrino magnetic moment arised after the great event of sn1987a , in connection with the modelling of a supernova explosion , where gigantic neutrino fluxes define in fact the process energetics .",
    "it means that such a microscopic neutrino characteristic , as the neutrino magnetic moment , would have a critical influence on macroscopic properties of these astrophysical events .",
    "namely , the left - handed neutrinos produced inside the supernova core during the collapse , could convert into the right - handed neutrinos due to the magnetic moment interaction .",
    "these sterile neutrinos would escape from the core leaving no energy to explain the observed luminosity of the supernova .",
    "thus , the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment can be established .",
    "this matter was investigated by many authors .",
    "we will mainly focus on the paper by r. barbieri and r.  n. mohapatra  @xcite which now looks as the most reliable instant constraint on the neutrino magnetic moment from sn1987a , according to  @xcite .",
    "the authors  @xcite considered the neutrino spin - flip via both @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering processes in the inner core of a supernova immediately after the collapse . imposing for the @xmath1 luminosity @xmath5 the upper limit of @xmath6 ergs / s ,",
    "the authors obtained the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment : @xmath7 however , the essential plasma polarization effects in the photon propagator were not considered in  @xcite , and the photon dispersion was taken in a phenomenolical way , by inserting an _ ad hoc _ thermal mass into the vacuum photon propagator .",
    "a detailed investigation of this question was performed in the papers by a. ayala , j.  c. dolivo and m. torres  @xcite , who used the formalism of the thermal field theory to take into account the influence of hot dense astrophysical plasma on the photon propagator .",
    "the upper bound on the neutrino magnetic moment compared with the result of the paper  @xcite , was improved in  @xcite in the factor of 2 : @xmath8 however , the authors  @xcite considered only the contribution of plasma electrons , and omitted the proton fraction .",
    "this is despite the fact that the electron and proton contributions to the neutrino spin - flip process were evaluated in  @xcite to be of the same order .",
    "thus , the reason exists to reconsider the neutrino spin - flip processes in the supernova core more attentively , and this is the subject of this paper .",
    "here we confirm in part , that the scattering on plasma protons is essential , as well as the scattering on plasma electrons .",
    "let us start from the cherenkov process of the photon ( plasmon ) creation by neutrino , @xmath9 , which should be appended by the crossed process of the photon absorption @xmath10 .",
    "the lagrangian of the interaction of a neutrino having a magnetic moment @xmath11 with photons is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the tensor of the photon electromagnetic field . for the creation process amplitude one obtains @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the photon polarization vector , and @xmath17 is the fourier transform of the neutrino magnetic moment current , @xmath18 q^\\mu \\ , . \\label{eq : nu_current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the four - momenta of the initial and final neutrinos and photon , respectively .",

    "instead of @xmath32 , the physical value we should be more interested in , is e.g. the right - handed neutrino flux , integrated over the initial left - handed neutrino states , i.e. the number of right - handed neutrinos emitted per unit time : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the left - handed neutrino distribution function with the chemical potential @xmath42 .",
    "there exists even more convenient value , the rate of creation of the right - handed neutrino @xmath1 , @xmath43 , with the fixed energy @xmath44 by all the left - handed neutrinos : @xmath45 given @xmath43 , one can calculate both the right - handed neutrino flux and the right - handed neutrino luminosity .",
