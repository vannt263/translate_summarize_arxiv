    "genetic drift is one of several evolutionary processes which lead to changes in allele frequencies in populations over time .",
    "as opposed to natural selection , it is driven purely by unspecific random sampling and chance events , and is now widely accepted to be a major evolutionary force ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to selective pressure , genetic drift leads to variations in allele frequencies . in large populations the variations",
    "are typically small compared to the population size , and these systems are dominated by the law of large numbers .",
    "but in small populations genetic variation and fluctuations in allele frequencies can have a significant impact @xcite and may even lead to speciation @xcite . for some species such as humans",
    "it has even been shown to be the primary force responsible for a particular feature @xcite .",
    "range expansions are frequently seen in the history of many species @xcite including humans @xcite , when they encompass new areas to draw upon greater resources in the newly found habitats or driven by changing environmental conditions .",
    "climatic changes trigger episodes of range contractions and expansions in many plant and animal species .",
    "for example , in recent decades , the increase in global temperatures has lead to pole - ward range extensions for a variety of species @xcite .",
    "range expansions leave a distinct pattern in the genetic structure of a population , which is found to be a reduction in diversity and an increased linkage between genetic markers @xcite .",
    "this enables historical patterns of range expansions to be traced @xcite .",
    "a special case of genetic drift and range expansion is known as the founder effect .",
    "when a small subset of the population breaks away and forms a new colony , the founders have strong effects on the newly created population s genetic make - up . through random sampling",
    "it is expected that there will be differences in allele frequencies between the original population and the colony , and over the course of many generations this genetic difference will amplify @xcite .",
    "for example the expansion of humans from a small population in africa to the whole world has lead to a decrease in heterozygosity in the population @xcite .",

    "compactness within the initial habitat and the use of immotile e.  coli leads to the population evolving only at the leading edge .",
    "as the colony grows , cells that loose contact to the colonization front can no longer participate in the colonization process .",
    "so the reproducing subset is a small fraction of the total population , chance effects are enhanced and provide the major force for gene segregation via genetic drift . from the initially well mixed population ,",
    "sectors of single gene alleles emerge , which can either expand or loose contact to the population front .",
    "this drives a coarsening process , which leads to a gradual decrease in the number of sectors as a consequence of genetic drift acting at the leading edge of the range expansion .",
    "the sectors surviving this annihilation process grow in size at the cost of those left behind , and appear to surf on the wave front @xcite .",
    "since the experiment uses immotile e.  coli on hard agar , there is no noticable change in the population behind the expanding front . therefore fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] provides a frozen record of the coarsening process during colonization .",
    "the domain coarsening process can be understood through the fluctuating path of the boundaries separating neighbouring sectors .",
    "a domain is frozen out when the leading ends of its boundaries meet and annihilate .",
    "a quantitative model and analysis of sector boundaries is presented in @xcite , where the assumption was made that the fluctuations of the motion taken by the leading tip of the domain boundary are diffusive .",
    "however , the authors also discuss that this idealization is not quite correct , since already in @xcite the mean squared displacement of the sector boundaries was estimated from experimental data to grow superdiffusively .",
    "this superdiffusive behaviour can be attributed to the roughness of the population front , following works on competition interfaces @xcite for rough surfaces in the kpz universality class @xcite .    in this paper , we incorporate the superdiffusivity of the sector boundaries and adapt the model introduced in @xcite .",
    "based on ideas in that paper , we present a new approach to separate the domain coarsening due to genetic drift and the domain growth due to range expansion . under an appropriate mapping",
    "the circular growth experiment can be understood in terms of annihilating one - dimensional diffusions in a generic linear geometry .",
    "this process has been well studied mathematically ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and serves as a prototype for the coarsening dynamics resulting from genetic drift . the geometric influence due to range expansions",
    "is completely summarized by the mapping .",
    "we argue that this approach is applicable in various situations , and provides a general understanding of the competing effects of genetic drift and range expansions on population fronts . to corroborate our results with good numerical precision ,",
    "we divise a lattice based spatial stochastic process similar to @xcite reproducing the basic features of the experiments in @xcite , and use monte carlo simulations for sampling .",
    "we would like to stress that the purpose of this model and the whole paper is not an accurate quantitative reproduction of experimental data from @xcite , but a contribution to the fundamental understanding of the effects of genetic drift on expanding population fronts as a generic emergent phenomenon for a large class of models .    in the next section we provide a description of the model and simulation methods , followed by a detailed numerical analysis of the sector boundaries in section 3 , which leads to an effective mathematical description of their fluctuations .",
    "this is used in section 4 to understand the domain coarsening under range expansions via a mapping to a generic linear geometry , which is our main result . in section 5",
    "we summarize and discuss the applicability of our approach in more general situations .",
    "a continuous time markov chain model on a two - dimensional square lattice is used to replicate the basic features of the experiments performed in @xcite .",
    "species labeled a and b are used to represent the two distinctly coloured e.  coli strains . as the strains are otherwise genetically identical ,",
    "the species a and b reproduce with the same rates @xmath1 , which we take equal to one . as seen in the experiment @xcite",
    ", the growth region has a finite width and we approximate this simply by allowing only those cells to reproduce which occupy a position at the colony front .",
    "any descendant of a cell inherits the type ( a or b ) from its parent and is placed with equal probability on one of the free neighbouring sites .",
    "when a cell loses contact to the boundary , it is dropped out of the reproducing subset and becomes part of the frozen interior of the colony . as the expansion increases these cells provide a traceable record of the random chance events that have taken place , which enables us to classify the ancestors of the current reproducing subpopulation . +",
    "this process is simulated using a monte carlo algorithm similar to a model in @xcite with random sequential update , which corresponds to the simulation of the jump chain of the markov model ( see e.g. @xcite , section 2.2 ) . in each time step",

    "@xmath2 is updated according to the growth event that just happened .",
    "depending on the geometry the new cell can become a member of @xmath2 , and others may have to be removed if they lost their only empty neighbouring site . for large sizes of @xmath2 the waiting time is typically approximated by its mean value @xmath5 , which gives a very good approximation of the continuous time markov chain model .",
    "+ we model the growth experiment @xcite on the agar plate by initializing an approximately circular subset of the square lattice of radius @xmath6 with a and b cells independently with probabilities @xmath7 , leading to a uniform mixture .",

    "we compare a single sample of the monte carlo simulation with the experimental picture from @xcite where @xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath11 ) , and both show very good qualitative agreement .",
    "this suggests that our markovian model provides a good reproduction of the basic features of the experiment on a large scale , more quantitative evidence will be given later .",
    "this is quite remarkable , since we have ignored all microscopic details of the reproduction mode of e.  coli which is clearly not spatially homogeneous or markovian ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is a strong indication that the observed segregation is an emergent phenomenon which is to a large extent independent of microscopic details of reproduction , as is discussed in more detail in section 5 .    in our model the size of the population front",
    "is basically given by the circumference and grows linearly with the radius . in section 4",
    "we will show that all statistical properties of this circular expanding process can be fully understood by mapping it onto a linear geometry where the population front has a fixed width . to simulate this",

    "we include a short exposition for completeness and refer the reader to @xcite for details .      if we only consider occupied and unoccupied sites and neglect the species , the growth of the population in our lattice based model is well known as the eden model of type c @xcite .",

    "it was noted in @xcite that this theoretical value coincides well with preliminary measurements of phase boundary fluctuations from real experimental data . in the following we present simulation data confirming these results , and use them to establish a model for phase boundaries which generalizes the purely diffusive approach in @xcite .",

    "the superdiffusivity of the boundary is not a result of large jumps as for e.g. levy processes , but arises from the continuous growth of the surface roughness .",

    "the circular model undergoes a range expansion where the size of the colony frontier grows linearly with radius @xmath78 due to the circular geometry .",
    "this growth is faster than the fluctuations of the sector boundaries of order @xmath160 , so that fixation is typically not reached .",

    "[ fig:10b ] , where the average number of sectors in the circular experiments are significantly larger than @xmath52 ( which would correspond to fixation ) .",
    "we have presented numerical evidence , that the sector boundaries of segregation patterns on expanding population fronts can be modelled by time changes of brownian motion .",
    "this lead to a complete understanding of the sector statistics for expanding circular geometries in terms of linear growth models with fixed width , which have been studied in great detail in the mathematics literature .",
    "the mapping ( [ r7 ] ) implies that @xmath107 converges to a finite limit @xmath132 as @xmath131 as long as @xmath164 which holds for all @xmath165 .",
    "so as long as the motion of sector boundaries is not ballistic ( i.e. @xmath166 ) , expansion will dominate the sector coarsening process and there is no fixation for expanding population fronts in a circular geometry .",
    "ballistic sector boundaries can result from different fitnesses modelled e.g.  by different reproduction rates @xmath167 and @xmath168 for the species . in that case",
    "the effects of circular range expansion and coarsening are on the same scale , which leads to interesting competition effects @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the strength of the range expansion effects can also be affected by non - circular geometries which lead to a non - linear growth of the population front with distance .",
    "this could be the result of certain geometrical constraints in the growth medium such as a landscape , which can therefore affect the biodiversity at the population front .",
    "we still expect that such systems can be understood by a mapping to the linear experiment analogous to the one presented in this paper . in general",
    ", the linear model provides the prototype for the pure coarsening effects due to genetic drift , and the full behaviour is determined by an interplay with geometric effects , which can be summarized in an effective mapping .",
    "the mathematical basis of this argument is that all continuous martingales are time - changed brownian motions .",
    "other possible models for the sector boundaries such as scaled brownian motions or fractional brownian motions are not martingales and the argument as presented here does not strictly apply .",
    "nevertheless , a mapping between different geometries similar to the one presented here should be justifyable at least heuristically also for other boundary models , since the sector boundaries do not exhibit large jumps or interact on macroscopic scales .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled in general as long as the species reproduces locally and does not migrate on a time scale faster than that of reproduction .",
    "note also that the sector boundaries inside the population do not have to be static in more general situations .",
    "but as long as the range expansion is fast enough , changes due to death , migration or reproduction inside the population will not affect the behaviour at the population front .",
    "so our approach is widely applicable for locally reproducing species under range expansions , as long as boundary growth is the fastest relevant process in the system .",
    "according to the well established paradigm of the kpz universality class @xcite , the scaling behaviour of the roughness @xmath60 of the population front ( [ e3 ] ) is largely independent on the microscopic details of the growth rules .",
    "this holds as long as spatial and temporal correlation lengths , resulting from these details or external effects from the environment , are small compared to the system size and growth time , respectively .",
    "if this is the case , the exponent @xmath142 of the path of sector boundaries is therefore not affected by details of the mode of reproduction of a single individuum , which will only influence the prefactor @xmath67 ( cf .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) ) .",
    "this determines the width of the sectors in the linear geometry in a very simple fashion ( cf .",
    "( [ rescale ] ) ) , whereas our main result , the mapping @xmath107 , is independent of @xmath67 and therefore applicable to a large class of locally reproducing species .",
    "the lattice based simulation model presented in this paper is only a simple caricature of that class , where we have assumed that cells divide in a spatially homogeneous fashion and follow a continuous time markov process , i.e. their reproduction time has an exponential distribution .",
    "although these assumptions do not hold for e.  coli , the correlation lengths referred to above are quite small and our simulations are therefore a good coarse grained model on a macroscopic level ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "it is quantitatively close , but to get the best possible agreement one would have to fit @xmath67 from a larger set of experimental data .",
    "it is of course an intriguing problem to predict the parameter @xmath67 from the microscopic details of the mode of replication , and we are currently working on a flexible off - lattice simulation model that will allow us to investigate this in detail . a first interesting example for comparison was also reported in @xcite , namely that for yeast ( s.  cerevisiae ) the sectoring patterns are significantly finer than the ones observed for e.  coli , corresponding to a reduced mobility of the boundaries and a smaller value of @xmath67 .",
