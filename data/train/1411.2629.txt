    "a surprising discovery of nasa s _ kepler _  mission is the existence of multi - transiting planetary systems with tightly - packed inner planets ( stips ) : typically @xmath6@xmath7-planet systems with radii @xmath8@xmath9 in short - period ( @xmath10@xmath11 ) orbits @xcite .",
    "planet - planet scattering followed by tidal circularization is unlikely to produce the observed low dispersion ( @xmath12 ) in their mutual orbital inclinations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "formation further out followed by inward , disk - mediated migration has been proposed .",
    "however , migration scenarios may produce planetary orbits that are trapped near low - order mean motion resonances ( mmr ) . such orbits are not particularly common among the _ kepler _  planet candidates ( kpcs ) .",
    "it has been argued that lower - mass planets , like kpcs , may not be efficiently trapped in resonance chains @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms , operating long after formation , may also move planets out of resonance @xcite .    _ in situ _ formation has also been proposed @xcite . standard _ in situ _",
    "formation models face challenges of concentrating the required large mass of solids extremely near the star , needing disks @xmath13 more massive than the minimum mass solar nebula and widely varying density profiles to explain observed stips .",
    "such disks may not be compatible with standard viscous accretion disk theory and a large fraction of them may not remain stable under self - gravity for reasonable gas - to - dust ratios @xcite .",
    "recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth ct14 ) proposed an alternative mechanism :  inside - out planet formation \" ( iopf ) , which alleviates some of the above problems . in a typical , steadily accreting disk , macroscopic",
    ", @xmath14cm - sized  pebbles \" formed from dust grain coagulation should undergo rapid inward radial drift and become trapped at the global pressure maxima expected at the dead - zone inner boundary ( dzib ) , where the ionization fraction set by thermal ionization of alkali metals drops below the critical value needed for the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) to operate .",
    "a ring forms with enhanced density of solids , promoting planet formation , perhaps first via gravitational instability to form @xmath14moon - size objects .",
    "these may then mutually collide to form a single dominant planet , which can also grow by continued accretion of pebbles .",
    "growth stops and planet mass is set when the planet is massive enough to open a gap in the disk leading to retreat of the dzib and its associated pressure maximum , and thus truncation of the supply of pebbles .",
    "this scenario naturally alleviates challenges of solid enhancement near the star since the pebble supply zone can be @xmath15 @xcite . for typical disk accretion rates and viscosities ,",
    "predicted values of @xmath0 , @xmath0-@xmath1 scalings for individual systems , and planet - planet separations are consistent with observed systems .",
    "here we focus on the innermost ( `` vulcan '' ) planet mass , @xmath2 , versus orbital radius , @xmath1 , relation that naturally follows from iopf theory and test whether observed systems support this scaling law . ",
    "[ s : derivation ] derives the theoretical @xmath2-@xmath1 relation . ",
    "[ s : obs ] summarizes relevant observed properties of kpcs allowing  [ s : compare ] to compare theory with observation . ",
    "[ s : conclude ] concludes .",
    "iopf theory predicts that position of formation of the innermost planet is determined by dzib location , first set by thermal ionzation of alkali metals at disk midplane temperatures @xmath16 . predicting this location",
    "is expected to be relatively simple compared to locations of subsequent planet formation , which depend on extent of dzib retreat , which depends on reduction of disk gas column density caused by presence of the first planet .",
    "ionization fraction may then increase further out in the disk either via increased midplane temperatures from higher protostellar heating or via increased received x - ray flux from the protostar or disk corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "following ct14 , the predicted formation location of the innermost planet using the fiducial shakura - sunyaev steady viscous active accretion disk model , and assuming negligible protostellar heating , is @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the power - law exponent of the barotropic equation of state @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are midplane pressure and density ) , @xmath22 is disk opacity , @xmath23 is viscosity parameter , @xmath24 is stellar mass , @xmath25 is accretion rate , and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is stellar radius .",
    "note that the choice of normalization for @xmath28 reflects expected values in the dead - zone region near the dzib , and this value is quite uncertain ( ct14 ) .",
    "[ eq : rdzib ] is the same as eq .",
    "11 of ct14 except , we have added an additional parameter @xmath29 to account for the fact that the estimate of midplane temperature can be affected by several factors , including energy extraction from a disk wind and protostellar heating . by comparison with more realistic protostellar disk models of @xcite",
    ", ct14 argued for a potential reduction in @xmath30 by a factor of two , perhaps also due to reduction in @xmath31 as dust grains begin to be destroyed .",
    "thus for our fiducial model , here we will use @xmath32 .    at the location given in eq .",
    "[ eq : rdzib ] , a forming planet may grow in mass , most likely by pebble accretion , to a gap opening mass determined by the viscous - thermal criterion @xcite , @xmath33 ( eq .  26 of ct14 ) where we adopt @xmath34 @xcite and @xmath1 is orbital radius of the forming planet .",
    "an uncertain quantity here is @xmath35 , which may vary widely from system to system and over time within a system .",
    "we eliminate the accretion rate term , @xmath36 , from eq .",
    "[ eq : mgap ] using eq .",
    "[ eq : rdzib ] and set @xmath37 to find the innermost planet mass , @xmath2 , ( i.e. , gap opening mass at dzib ) as a function of @xmath1 : @xmath38 i.e. , @xmath39 : a linear increase in innermost planet mass with orbital radius of formation .",
    "note , variation in @xmath1 is caused by variation in @xmath35 : higher @xmath35 results in @xmath40  k at larger radius .",
    "the dependence on @xmath31 and @xmath41 vanish .",
    "the normalization of the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation depends on @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath28 .",
    "if subsequent planetary migration is negligible , then equation  [ eq : mgvsr ] s prediction can be compared directly with the observed stips innermost planets .",
    "two arguments suggest planetary migration from the initial formation site may be small .",
    "first , when the planet is still forming and has not yet opened a gap , drastic change in @xmath28 at the dzib creates an outwardly increasing surface density gradient and unsaturated corotation torques suppress type i migration @xcite creating a  planet trap \" at the ( dzib ) pressure maximum @xcite .",
    "second , when the planet is massive enough to open a gap , its mass already dominates over that in the inner gas disk , limiting scope for type ii migration .",
    "while iopf ( ct14 ) predicts @xmath0 , planets of the same mass may attain widely varying average densities ( @xmath45 ) depending on relative importance of gas and pebble accretion and also atmospheric puffiness , dependent on detailed atmospheric properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus predicting @xmath46 is not straightforward within the framework of iopf .",
    "however , only @xmath46 is measured for most _ kepler_-discovered systems , and especially the smaller planets exhibit wide ranges of @xmath45 even when they are of comparable sizes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , both mean and overall range of @xmath45 vary based on the planet mass range under consideration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.[fig : rho ] ) .",
    "hence , direct comparison between theory and observation is difficult for individual planets and a statistical approach is needed .    to convert iopf - predicted @xmath0 into a corresponding @xmath46 , probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for @xmath45 that change continuously as",
    "a function of @xmath0 would be ideal .",
    "radial velocity ( rv ) follow - up and transit timing variation ( ttv ) measurements have constrained @xmath0 for some _ kepler _  systems ( * ? ? ? * for a list ) . however , the small number of observed planets where @xmath45 could be measured limits how finely the different @xmath0 ranges can be sampled . for this study",
    ", we divide the set of planets with known @xmath45 crudely in four groups , each ranging over 1 dex in @xmath0 with boundaries at @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . since no exoplanets with measured @xmath45 have @xmath49",
    ", we include planets with @xmath0 up to half a dex into the next group to determine the @xmath45-distribution for mass group @xmath50 .",
    "we estimate the observed @xmath45 pdfs for each group separately by fitting lognormals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] ) .",
    "we assume that all planets within each mass group have the same pdf for @xmath45 .",
    "we use the appropriate @xmath45-distribution for an iopf - predicted @xmath0 for a given @xmath1 , to randomly generate the average density and calculate @xmath46 in  [ s : compare ] .",
    "note that this division in groups is quite arbitrary , but necessary given the available data .",
    "@xmath0 values of the thousands of kpcs with measured @xmath46 are often estimated using simple power - law relations , derived based on planets with measured @xmath0 from rv followup and ttv @xcite .",
    "although , choosing a simple @xmath0-@xmath46 power - law relation essentially ignores @xmath45 dispersions at a fixed @xmath46 , they are popular because of their simplicity . fig .",
    "[ fig : mprp ] shows a compilation of the data for planets with directly measured @xmath0 and @xmath46 , together with two previously published fitted @xmath0-@xmath46 power - law relations by ( * ? ? ? * henceforth pl1 ) and @xcite .",
    "we also include our own best fit power - law relation following @xcite for planets between @xmath51 , but not forcing the relation to match the earth .",
    "we derive @xmath52 ( henceforth pl2 ) by fitting data with uniform weighting , independent of measurement errors .",
    "this choice is made since we expect the spread in masses at a given radius reflects an intrinsic dispersion in density and we wish to avoid the average relation of the planet population being biased towards the systems that happen to have the smallest errors .",
    "finally , we construct a piecewise power - law ( henceforth pl3 ) by connecting the @xmath46 and @xmath0 values at the middle @xmath46 points in each @xmath0 group and the mean of @xmath53 values at the group boundaries along the mean @xmath54 lines in each group ; @xmath55 , @xmath56 intervals @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the estimated @xmath0 can thus be different for the same observed @xmath46 depending on which power - law is used . however , fig .",
    "[ fig : mprp ] shows that the intrinsic dispersion in @xmath0 at a given @xmath46 , due to a dispersion in @xmath45 , is larger than the differences between the power laws . for completeness we will use all three power - laws pl13 to estimate @xmath0 for a given @xmath46 and",
    "show the resulting differences .",
    "for this study we do not use the power - law proposed by @xcite since its applicability is within a limited range in @xmath60 .",
    "since we are interested in testing whether properties of stips innermost planets are consistent with iopf predictions , we restrict ourselves only to innermost kpcs in multiplanet systems ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we obtain kpc data from nasa s exoplanet archive ( http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu ; june 25 , 2014 update ) .",
    "we find that for the 629 multi - transiting systems , @xmath62 , where errors are @xmath63 obtained from parameter estimation and fitting is done using equal weight to each data point ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rpvsa]a ) .    while creating the synthetic innermost planet populations based on the iopf model we pay attention to replicate all observational biases in the observed sample as closely as possible .",
    "we import the period @xmath20 , semimajor axis @xmath64 , assumed to be equal to @xmath1 ( low eccentricity ) , @xmath27 , and _ kepler _  magnitude ( @xmath65 ) for the innermost kpcs . this way our synthetic planet sample automatically preserves the observed distribution of planetary orbital and host star properties .",
    "for a given @xmath1 we use eq .",
    "[ eq : mgvsr ] to determine @xmath0 as predicted by iopf .",
    "densities are then randomly assigned by drawing from the appropriate lognormal pdfs (  [ s : obs ] ) .",
    "we restrict @xmath45 to be between @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are not very sensitive to reasonable changes in the @xmath45 range .",
    "note , the actual total range in @xmath45 is unknown and transit observations are biased towards detecting lower density planets in general .",
    "planet size @xmath46 is calculated using @xmath0 and @xmath45 . using host star @xmath65 values",
    "we estimate the combined differential photometric precision following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we then estimate whether this synthetic planet would be detectable ( snr@xmath68 assuming @xmath69 observation ) by _ kepler_. we repeat this process until we generate one _ kepler_-detectable planet for each host star .",
    "examples of synthetic populations , each of @xmath70 detectable planets , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpvsa](b ) using @xmath71 , and ( c ) using @xmath72 .",
    "we find iopf - predicted @xmath73 versus @xmath1 , @xmath74 , shows very similar scaling as that of the observed planets .",
    "the absolute normalization is somewhat arbitrary and depends on unconstrained disk properties including @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "for example , while the scaling remains very similar , the proportionality constant changes with a change of the adopted value of @xmath28 . for @xmath72 both the scaling and the normalization agree well for the @xmath73@xmath1 relations in the observed and synthetic samples .    turning to masses ,",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath1 relation depends on the adopted @xmath0-@xmath46 relation .",
    "for pl13 these are given as @xmath75 , respectively for the observed sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mpvsa ] ) .",
    "thus , adopting a simple @xmath0-@xmath46 relation , or equivalently , assuming a fixed @xmath45 for a given @xmath46 in estimating @xmath0 results in @xmath2-@xmath1 scalings that are shallower than the linear prediction of iopf ( eq .  [ eq : mgvsr ] ) .",
    "[ fig : mpvsa ] shows the comparison between observed and synthetic populations for pl13 and for @xmath71 and @xmath76 .",
    "we find that for all considered simple @xmath0-@xmath46 relations ( pl13 ) , best - fit power laws for observed and predicted planet populations agree reasonably well . as for the @xmath73-@xmath1 relations ,",
    "the scalings agree within expected statistical fluctuations for both @xmath28 values .",
    "the normalization is again off by a factor of a few for @xmath71 , but is quite similar for @xmath72 for all @xmath0-@xmath46 power - laws .",
    "it is also instructive to see the degree to which estimated @xmath0 can diverge from actual @xmath0 due to the assumption of fixed @xmath45 for fixed @xmath46 , or equivalently , assuming a simple power - law relation between @xmath46 and @xmath0 .",
    "using such power - laws , while useful for a crude estimate of @xmath0 from an observed @xmath46 , can lead to derived @xmath0 being very different from the actual one , due to the intrinsic dispersion in density .",
    "this highlights the importance of further ttv analysis and rv followup .    assuming that our selected observed sample of innermost planets truly are innermost , `` vulcan '' planets ,",
    "their observed orbital radii can also constrain @xmath35 via eq .",
    "[ eq : rdzib ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdot ] shows histograms of the expected @xmath35 for the observed systems if formed via iopf .",
    "the estimated effective @xmath35 for a given innermost planet s position depends on @xmath28 .",
    "we find that the majority of the observed sample of innermost planets predict effective @xmath35 between @xmath77@xmath78 for @xmath72 .",
    "the tail towards very large @xmath79 may indicate that some selected planets are not actually innermost planets : either there is an undetected inner planet , or perhaps the original inner planet has been removed via , for example , collision or ejection .",
    "we showed that iopf predicts stips innermost planet mass , @xmath2 , increases linearly with @xmath1 , independent of @xmath35 , @xmath41 , or @xmath31 .",
    "absolute values for @xmath2 , however , depend strongly on disk properties , especially viscosity parameter @xmath28 .    using fiducial disk parameters and observationally motivated mass - based density ranges we found the iopf @xmath73-@xmath1 scaling is consistent with that in observed _ kepler _  multis ( fig .",

    "involved assuming a @xmath0-@xmath46 relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mprp ] ) . the estimated @xmath2-@xmath1 scalings vary depending on which @xmath0-@xmath46 relation was chosen , even when the real underlying relation is @xmath80 .",
    "we showed that @xmath2-@xmath1 scalings for theoretical and observed populations agree within expected uncertainties for all adopted @xmath0-@xmath46 relations . assuming formation via iopf , the distribution of @xmath1 for the innermost planets implies @xmath35 between @xmath81@xmath82 , adopting our preferred dzib @xmath72 .    for comparison between",
    "the iopf predicted and observed inner planet properties we had to make several simplifying assumptions .",
    "we assumed the @xmath0-based @xmath45 distributions for stips innermost planets are similar to those obtained from all planets with known @xmath45 .",
    "however , iopf innermost planets , forming very close to the star , potentially have quite different entropy structure in their atmospheres and thus systematically different densities compared to planets that form further out .",
    "we have also assumed that the apparent innermost planet in multitransiting systems are truly so . limiting the observed sample to only multitransiting systems and only out to @xmath83 alleviates this problem somewhat .",
    "the exact @xmath73-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath1 relations for the synthetic planet population predicted by iopf depend somewhat on the @xmath0-based @xmath45 distributions adopted .",
    "however , for several observationally motivated @xmath45 distributions we find agreement between the theoretical and observed populations .",
    "nevertheless , since the @xmath45 pdf in the lowest - mass bin is the most important in determining the fraction of detectable small planets in a synthetic population , more observational constraints on densities of low - mass planets ( @xmath84 ) will be very useful for a more robust comparison .",
    "continued efforts for rv followup and ttv measurements will potentially lead to more mass measurements making a more direct comparison possible for testing iopf theory .",
    "another source of change in the final @xmath2 and @xmath73 vs @xmath1 relations is possible inward migration of some planets after they have formed via iopf , which needs to be investigated in future numerical simulations .",
    "finally , we point out that there may be other mechanisms that can help create @xmath85 vs @xmath1 correlations . for example , increasing planet mass with radius may be related to radial dependence of massloss via stellar irradiation @xcite . a quantitative calculation of the effects of this mass - loss , which will tend to steepen the iopf @xmath2 vs @xmath1 relation , will require modeling the composition and size of the planets , as well as the history of their euv and x - ray flux exposure .",
