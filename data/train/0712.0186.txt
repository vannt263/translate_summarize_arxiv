    "in fact , the experimental results range within 3 order of magnitudes : the theoretical dependence on the third power of the mass is well verified .",

    "the mixing angle @xmath53 is in the phenomenological range between @xmath54 and @xmath55 as found also by more refined studies .",
    "this simple exercise shows that su(3 ) flavor relations , together with the @xmath56 rule allowing to include the flavor singlet in the game , is well upheld and a good starting point to test the quarkonium assignment in a given nonet .    _",

    "the resonances under study are the isovector @xmath57 with @xmath58 mev and the isoscalars @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( we omit tiny errors , see@xcite ) .",

    "a fit of the angle @xmath63 to these values leads to @xmath72 and a very small @xmath73 thus the experimental values are reproduced almost exactly .",
    "the value of @xmath72 is in good agreement with the study of strong decays@xcite .",
    "again , the @xmath0-ratios can be well described by simple symmetry relations .",
    "indeed , the agreement is even better than in the pseudoscalar case : this is expected because the masses vary in a smaller energy region . in the end",
    ", we remind that a quarkonium interpretation works well for vector mesons : here the dominant e.m .",
    "transition is into one single photon ( i.e. mixing ) which is at the basis of the successful phenomenology of the vector meson dominance hypothesis .",
    "_ scalar nonet below 1 gev- _ let us now turn back to the scalar states below 1 gev within a quarkonium assignment .",
    "we identify the neutral isovector @xmath9 with @xmath74 and , as described above , the isoscalars with @xmath3 and @xmath75 the experimental results for the decay width of @xmath76 and @xmath24 are given by@xcite : @xmath77 kev , @xmath78 kev .",
    "thus , the experimental ratio reads then @xmath79 where an average error of @xmath80 kev for @xmath81 has been used . as noticeable",
    ", the error for this ratio is large .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental situation concerning @xmath82 is even worse ; no average or fit is presented in@xcite , however two experiments listed in@xcite find large @xmath0 decay widths : @xmath83 kev and @xmath84 kev , respectively . in a footnote",
    "it is then state that these values could be assigned to @xmath85 ( actually , in a older version of pdg@xcite these values were assigned to the resonance @xmath85 ) .",
    "it is not clear if the @xmath0 signal comes from the high mass tail of the broad @xmath86 state or from @xmath85 ( or even from both ) . we determine the mixing angle @xmath87 by using the experimental result @xmath88 . due to the large error",
    "we report the possible ranges for @xmath87 compatible with it : @xmath89 ( central value @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 ( central value @xmath92 ) .",
    "indeed , as we saw previously the angle @xmath45 in the pseudoscalar sector is negative : the components of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are in phase for @xmath93 and out of phase for @xmath31 ( @xmath94 ) . within the njl model the mixing strength is generated by the t hooft term , and turns out to have opposite sign with respect to the pseudoscalar sector : this would favour a positive value of @xmath95 furthermore , studies without the strange meson can reproduce the @xmath3 resonance : this favors small mixing angles . then , a value @xmath96 is favoured .",
    "the corresponding two - photon decay rate is @xmath97 ( which in turn means @xmath98 kev , considerably smaller than the above mentioned ( but not established ) experimental result ) .",
    "surely , when including finite width effects the decay rate @xmath99 increases : in fact , the kinematical factor @xmath100 makes the right - tail of the broad distribution of @xmath3 important@xcite .",
    "however , the rate of increase is not dramatic : it can at most double the above quoted results but not reach values of about 2 - 5 kev .",
    "this result is contrary to the usual belief that a quarkonium decay rate should be well above 1 kev@xcite : indeed , as we discuss in the next subsection a careful microscopic calculation of the two - photon decay rate shows that results below 1 kev are expected@xcite .    for the discussion of scalar states above 1 gev",
    "we refer to@xcite , where the inclusion of a glueball state mixing with quarkonia also influences the @xmath0 decay rate : in fact , a glueball is expected to have a small @xmath0-transition amplitude , thus if a resonance will have a consistent glueball component the @xmath0 decay rate is small .",
    "no @xmath0-signal is found for @xmath101 pointing to a large gluonic amount in its wave function .      in this subsection",
    "we refer to@xcite , where the @xmath0-decay rate has been carried out within a local and nonlocal microscopic model . here",
    "we discuss only the latter .",
    "the relevant nonlocal interaction lagrangian , involving the mesonic quarkonium field @xmath102 and the quark fields @xmath103 reads@xcite @xmath104 where the delocalization takes account of the extended nature of the quarkonium state by the covariant vertex function @xmath105 . the ( euclidean ) fourier transform of this vertex function is taken as @xmath106 also assuring uv - convergence of the model . the cutoff parameter @xmath107 is vaired between @xmath5 and @xmath108 gev , corresponding to an extension of the @xmath86 of about @xmath109 fm .",
    "the coupling @xmath110 is determined by the so - called compositeness condition@xcite . in the calculation",
    "the quark mass varies between 0.3 and 0.45 gev .",
    "the two - photon decay occurs via a triangle - diagram of quarks .",
    "notice that due to the presence of the vertex function @xmath105 inclusion of the electromagnetic interaction is achieved by gauging the nonlocal interaction lagrangian ( [ lnonloc ] ) : in addition to the usual photon - quark coupling obtained by minimal substitution new vertices arise , where the photon couples directly to the @xmath111 interaction vertex , see@xcite for details . their contribution , important on a conceptual level to assure gauge invariance , is numerically suppressed . in table  1",

    "this result is indeed in agreement with that of the previous subsection : a light quarkonium state has a @xmath0 decay rate smaller than 1 kev .",
    "however , this does nt prove that the resonance @xmath3 is a quark - antiquark state .",
    "it rather tells us that , being the @xmath0 decay width of a quarkonium smaller than what usually believed , care is needed when using @xmath0-rates to discuss the nature of light scalars .",
