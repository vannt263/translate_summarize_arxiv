    "in the last decade the quality of chemical vapor deposited ( cvd ) diamond for particle detectors has greatly improved , and the use of this material has become a potentially attractive option for vertex detectors at high luminosity colliders ( such as the lhc after the proposed luminosity upgrade  @xcite ) promising to provide the radiation resistance needed for the challenging particle fluxes expected .",
    "diamond detectors are believed to be more radiation - hard than silicon  @xcite . even after radiation exposures in excess of @xmath1",

    "the charge collection distance depends on the presence of charge carrier traps  @xcite .",
    "once a deep level trap has captured a charge carrier the trap can be permanently passivated . as a consequence of this process",
    ", cvd diamond shows a significant increase in the charge collection distance after being exposed to fluences of the order of @xmath7 minimum ionizing particles per @xmath8 , a process called pumping or priming .",
    "cvd diamond remains for a long period ( months ) in the primed state if kept in the dark and at room temperature .",
    "cvd diamond usually has a polycrystalline structure with an average crystallite size on the growth side of the order of 1/7 of the thickness  @xcite . on the substrate side",
    "the crystal size is only a few micrometers .",
    "the charge collection distance can be different in different crystallites  @xcite , leading to a non - uniform response and a broadening of the distribution of the charge signal from the whole substrate .",
    "in this paper we report test - beam measurements and simulations of diamond pixel detectors equipped with a prototype electronics chip of the atlas pixel silicon detector  @xcite . in section  [ sec2 ] the analysis of test - beam data taken with two diamond pixel detectors is presented . the spatial resolution and detection efficiency of the detectors",
    "are reported , and the observation of a non uniform response of the detectors across the sensor area is discussed . in section  [ sec3 ] a numerical simulation of the charge collection processes inside the diamond sensor and of the detector response is presented .",
    "it is shown that the non uniform response can be reproduced as a consequence of the polarization fields created by the charge trapped in the crystallite structure .",
    "test beam experiments were performed at the cern sps accelerator during the years 2000 and 2001 with a pion beam of 180 gev/_c _ momentum .",
    "a beam telescope consisting of 4 silicon microstrip modules was used to measure the transverse position of the incident beam particles . in the setup used in the year 2000  @xcite each module consisted of a pair of microstrip detectors , each providing one coordinate . in the setup used in 2001 each module consisted of a double - sided microstrip detector .",
    "the new telescope used a readout architecture including zero suppression  @xcite , which offered higher trigger rate capability .",
    "for both set - ups , the position resolution of tracks projected onto the tested devices was about 6 @xmath0 m .",

    "the sensors were then lapped on the substrate side by about @xmath10 m and on the growth side by about 50  @xmath0 m so that the final thickness is 432  @xmath0 m for uts-5 and 470  @xmath0 m for cd91 .",
    "the lateral dimensions of the sensors were @xmath11 .",

    "@xmath13 is the coordinate along the short ( 50 @xmath0 m ) dimension of the pixels , @xmath14 is the coordinate along the long ( 400  @xmath0 m ) dimension of the pixels , and @xmath15 is the coordinate perpendicular to the pixel plane .    before operation at the test beam , data were taken with a @xmath16am and a @xmath17sr source , with activities of 74  mbq and 62  kbq respectively .",
    "the sources were kept for 12  h at about 5  mm from the diamond sensor .",
    "the @xmath18 source delivered a fluence of the order of @xmath19 ( 0.3  gy dose ) to each sensor , which is enough to bring good quality diamond in the primed state  @xcite .",
    "this conclusions is supported by the test beam data , discussed below , since the average signal and the detection efficiency did not show any time dependence during the data taking .",
    "the electronics chips were produced during the development phase of the atlas pixel front - end electronics program  @xcite .",
    "their design was similar to that of the final front - end electronics for atlas pixel  @xcite .",
    "in each front - end chip , 2880 channels are arranged into 18 columns by 160 rows .",
    "the charge - sensitive preamplifiers feature a dc feedback scheme with a tunable current providing control over the shaping - time for a given input charge .",
    "a discrimination stage sits behind the preamplifier in each channel which is sensitive to the leading edges and the trailing edges of pulses .",
    "each channel is equipped with its own 3-bit dac for channel - to - channel threshold adjustments , thus a means of overall dispersion reduction is provided .",
    "the chips have a 7-bit charge measurement capability using the time - over - threshold ( tot ) of the signal .",
    "the tot is calibrated by injecting a known charge into every channel .",
    "a 2880-bit pixel register plus one corresponding latch per channel enable individual pixels to be masked - off independently for calibration - strobing and readout .",

    "only pixel signals whose leading edge belongs to the period specified by an external trigger are read out . at the test - beam the trigger",
    "was provided by two scintillator detectors and 16 consecutive 25  ns time windows were accepted .    during the operation in the test beam the thresholds of the individual channels",
    "were adjusted achieving a threshold dispersion of less than 100  e. a typical threshold setting was 1000  e while the average noise per pixel was about 200  e.",
    "events were filtered with the requirement of one and only one track reconstructed by the silicon microstrip telescope in each event .",
    "only events with a track reconstruction @xmath20 probability greater than 0.02 were kept .",
    "tracks were required to extrapolate into a fiducial area . for cd91",
    "this was the surface covered by the pixel array , excluding the region within 40  @xmath0 m of the border .",
    "for uts-5 it was the smaller area with a good bump - bonding yield  @xcite .",
    "pixel clusters were built clustering together all adjacent pixels , independently of track extrapolations .",

    "the reasons for the poor diamond resolution were investigated by looking at the mean @xmath13 residuals and @xmath14 coordinates of the track extrapolation . the pixel cluster position , in contrast , is determined with far better precision in the @xmath13 direction , because of the 8:1 aspect ratio of atlas pixels .",

    "the silicon sensor ( upper plot ) shows a more uniform distribution .",

    "no correlation is observed between these regions and the segmentation in pixels .",
    "the scale of the residual clustering is of the order of 100  @xmath0 m which is also the typical size of the diamond crystallites .",
    "this suggests that in some crystallites the drift of the charge carriers has a component parallel to the sensor surface , so that the average position of the pixel clusters is shifted away from the track position .",

    "to quantify the apparent clustering of residual shifts , the linear correlation coefficient between the residuals of all track pairs has been determined .",
    "since each event which passes selection cuts has only one reconstructed track , the pairs are formed considering the tracks of two different events .",
    "correlation coefficients are determined in bins of the distance between the two tracks of a pair .",
    "an empirical fit function    @xmath46    has been found to describe the data of the correlation coefficient of residuals as a function of track separation @xmath13 .",

    "the correlation amplitude @xmath50 is @xmath51 for uts5 and @xmath52 for cd91 .",
    "the presence of the exponential peak in the diamond correlation distribution is evidence of non - homogeneous charge collection properties producing local systematic shifts in the position response .",
    "the investigation of their origin is the subject of the studies described in the next chapter .",
    "in order to understand the experimental results in terms of the microscopic properties of charge carriers drift in diamond , a numerical simulation of the response of diamond sensors to ionizing radiation has been developed .",
    "the interactions of high - energy pions with the diamond sensor have been simulated using the geant4 package  @xcite .",
    "this step of the simulation produces a file with a list of the energy deposits of the particles inside diamond ( hits ) .",
    "the energy of each hit is converted into a number of electron - hole pairs using the conversion factor of one pair for 13.1  ev of deposited energy .",
    "the charge carriers are then drifted in the diamond in steps of @xmath53 m until they are trapped or they are collected at the electrodes .",
    "* drift model : * the drift direction is determined by the local electric field and thermal diffusion .",
    "the local electric field is the superposition of the external field of 1040  v / mm and the polarization field created by the charge carriers trapped in the sensor .",

    "the resulting conflicts between grains claiming the same space element are solved assigning to each grain a probability to defeat the other proportional to the grain width .",

    "trapping model : * the probability for a charge carrier to be trapped within the drift step @xmath72 is @xmath73 where @xmath63 is the velocity and @xmath74 the lifetime .",

    "this model is supported by observations that the impurity concentration is strongly enhanced at grain boundaries  @xcite thus resulting in a larger density of electrically active traps  @xcite .",
    "priming is simulated by implementing two classes of traps  @xcite .",
    "after they capture a charge , the traps of one class can act as recombination centers , while the traps of the other class are permanently passivated .",
    "the electron and hole lifetimes are computed as    @xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81 is the density of unfilled traps of both classes , @xmath82 is the density of recombination centers filled with holes ( electrons ) .",
    "@xmath18 can be interpreted as the product of the charge carriers thermal velocity and an effective trapping cross section .",
    "it is the same for traps of the two classes but different values can be set for electrons and holes .    when a charged carrier is trapped , the local density of filled and unfilled traps and the local trapped charge density are updated .",
    "the polarization field created by the trapped charges is periodically updated and superimposed to the external field to get the electric field map .",
    "as the diamond sensor is exposed to ionizing radiation , three dose - dependent effects occur :    * the pure trapping centers are passivated , so that the effective trap density is reduced , simulating the priming effect . * near the electrodes the charge carrier which is drifting toward the electrode is dominant ( electrons near the pixels electrodes , holes on the other side ) .",

    "electrons and holes approach this surface from opposite directions , and are trapped before reaching the interface because of the very high trapping density .",
    "hence a space charge distribution is created , with opposite signs on the two sides of the interface .",
    "the electric field they produce is normal to the interface , and has a component which is transverse to the external field .",

    "the parameters of the trapping model discussed are @xmath83 and the fraction @xmath84 of pure trapping centers as explained above .",
    "a constraint on the above parameters is provided by the measured value of the average collected charge ( 3000  @xmath85 ) .",
    "this still leaves four degrees of freedom in the parameter choice .",
    "since the other parameters are related to unmeasured properties ( such as the priming ratio , or the hole / electron lifetime ratio ) it is not possible to determine them from the data .",
    "some educated guesses have been made instead , with the purpose of building a model which can qualitatively reproduce the features observed in the data , in particular the systematic position shifts .",
    "the choice of final values for the parameters is reported below .    *",

[ priming ] ) , instead the signal reaches a maximum and then decreases , as the field screening prevails over the passivation effect .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to choices of the model parameters which give a priming curve typical for diamond sensors exposed to minimum ionizing particles .",
    "most likely , to achieve a quantitative agreement with the data requires a more accurate trapping model . in the model described in section  [ model ] only two classes of traps have been implemented , pure trapping centres with cross sections @xmath106 and @xmath107 for electrons and holes respectively and trapping / recombination centres with the same cross sections @xmath106 and @xmath107 both for trapping and recombination processes . in general , several classes of trapping centres",

    "test - beam data were taken with diamond pixel detectors . a detection efficiency of about 70% and a spatial resolution of about 20  @xmath0 m were obtained .",
    "the fine segmentation provided by the pixels and the tracking of the particles by a silicon microstrip telescope allowed a study of the spatial resolution of the detector as a function of the incident position of the particles .",
    "the spatial resolution was found to be degraded by the presence of regions where the reconstructed impact position given by the pixel cluster and the true track position measured with a beam telescope deviate systematically .",
    "these regions have the same dimension of the diamond crystallites ( about 100  @xmath0 m ) hence they appear to be related to the polycrystalline nature of the sensor .",
