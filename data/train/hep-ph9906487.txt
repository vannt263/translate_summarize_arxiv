    "in recent years solar - neutrino and atmospheric - neutrino measurements have provided a growing body of evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the observed solar neutrino deficit  @xcite can be interpreted as evidence for the oscillation of electron neutrinos ( @xmath8 ) into neutrinos of a different flavor .",
    "the recent atmospheric - neutrino results from the super - kamiokande collaboration  @xcite , along with other experiments  @xcite suggest the oscillation of muon neutrinos ( @xmath9 ) into neutrinos of a different flavor , which are dominantly either tau neutrinos ( @xmath10 ) or sterile neutrinos ( @xmath11 ) . taken together , these results suggest the mixing of at least three different neutrino types  @xcite . in addition , the lsnd collaboration has reported  @xcite results from @xmath12 decays at rest that could be interpreted as the first evidence for @xmath13 oscillations in an accelerator based experiment .",
    "lsnd has also reported  @xcite results from measurements of @xmath14 decays in flight that could be the first evidence for @xmath2 oscillations . if all of the above reported effects survive , then oscillations to a sterile neutrino are required , since there would then be three distinct mass - squared difference ( @xmath15 ) values  @xcite .",
    "the solar - neutrino , atmospheric - neutrino , and lsnd results have generated much interest in future accelerator - based neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we can anticipate that an extensive experimental program will be needed to firmly establish the existence of neutrino oscillations and to precisely determine all the parameters relevant to the phenomenon .",
    "the up - coming accelerator - based experiments  @xcite will firmly ground the existence of neutrino oscillations , and measure some of the associated parameters .",
    "also , reactor experiments will tightly constrain @xmath8 disappearance  @xcite ; a sensitivity down to @xmath16  ev@xmath6 is expected in kamland .",
    "however , precise measurements of neutrino mass - squared differences and the mixing matrix that relates neutrino - flavor eigenstates to neutrino - mass eigenstates will almost certainly require a further generation of experiments exploiting higher intensity and/or higher quality neutrino beams than currently available  @xcite .",
    "other goals of such experiments might be ( i ) to determine whether the atmospheric neutrino oscillations are @xmath17 , @xmath1 , or a mixture of both  @xcite , ( ii ) to detect earth matter effects on neutrino oscillations  @xcite , ( iii ) when matter effects are present , to determine the ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates responsible for the oscillation being measured  @xcite , and ( iv ) to detect @xmath4 and @xmath18 violation if it exists in the lepton sector  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that higher intensity and higher quality neutrino beams could be made by exploiting the very intense muon sources that are currently being developed as a part of ongoing muon collider  @xcite feasibility studies .",
    "the muons would be accelerated up to the desired energy , and injected into a storage ring consisting of two long straight sections joined together by two arcs .",
    "muons that decay in the straight sections would form neutrino beams consisting of 50% @xmath9 and 50% @xmath19 if negative muons are stored , and 50% @xmath8 and 50% @xmath20 if positive muons are stored .",
    "a compact muon storage ring neutrino source could be tilted downwards at a large angle to enable neutrino beams to be directed through the earth .",
    "if the muons from a muon collider muon source are accelerated to energies of @xmath21  gev and injected into a suitable storage ring , it has been shown that the neutrino fluxes are sufficient to detect hundreds of neutrino charged current ( cc ) interactions per year in a reasonable size detector on the other side of the earth  @xcite .",
    "the muon storage ring neutrino source idea has led to several recent workshops  @xcite .",
    "a number of papers  @xcite have discussed the physics potential of this new type of neutrino facility .",
    "in addition , a preliminary muon storage ring neutrino source design study has been made  @xcite , and further studies are planned .",
    "the evolution of the existing accelerator complexes at fermilab  @xcite and cern  @xcite towards a muon collider with a muon storage ring neutrino source has also been considered .",
    "much further work will be required to develop a realistic design before the first muon storage ring neutrino source can be proposed .",
    "in this paper we consider the physics potential of muon storage ring neutrino sources that are being considered in explicit upgrade scenarios for the fermilab accelerator complex .",
    "two different geometries are considered : ( i ) a neutrino source at fermilab pointing toward the soudan mine in minnesota ( @xmath22  km ) , and ( ii ) a neutrino source at fermilab pointing toward the gran sasso underground laboratory in italy ( baseline length @xmath23  km ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the characteristics of neutrino beams from muon storage ring sources are discussed and the basic oscillation formulas are presented . the role of muon storage ring neutrino sources in exploring the parameters associated with @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations",
    "is considered in section  iii .",

    "v we discuss @xmath25 oscillations .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section  vi .",
    "the neutrino fluxes and interaction rates at a given location downstream of a muon storage ring neutrino source depend upon the number of stored muons , the beam divergence within the neutrino - beam forming straight section , and the energies and polarization of the decaying muons . in this section",
    "we describe the storage ring parameters , discuss the muon decay kinematics , present the calculated neutrino fluxes and interaction rates at @xmath22  km and 7332  km , and discuss the matter effects for @xmath26 , @xmath3 , and @xmath27 oscillations .",
    "a preliminary design study for a muon storage ring neutrino source at fermilab is described in ref .",
    "the neutrino source consists of :    \\(i ) an upgraded high - intensity proton source  @xcite that cycles at 15  hz , and delivers 12 bunches per cycle , each containing @xmath28 protons at 16  gev .",
    "\\(ii ) a pion production target , pion collection system , and decay channel .",

    "are produced for each proton incident on the production target .",
    "hence there would be about @xmath29 muons of the desired charge at the end of the decay channel per accelerator cycle , and therefore @xmath30 muons per operational year ( @xmath31  secs ) .",
    "\\(iii ) a muon cooling channel that captures the muons exiting the decay channel into bunches with rms lengths @xmath32  m , and a normalized transverse emittance @xmath33  m - rad .",
    "the cooling channel reduces the emittance to @xmath34  m - rad . at the end of the cooling channel",
    "there would be about @xmath35 muons of the desired charge per accelerator cycle , contained within 12 bunches with rms lengths @xmath36  m , a mean muon energy of 230  mev , and an energy spread given by @xmath37 .",
    "hence , there would be @xmath38 cooled muons per operational year .",
    "\\(iv ) an acceleration system that captures the muons from each long bunch exiting the cooling channel into 16 short bunches with @xmath39  cm , and accelerates the muons to 10  gev .",
    "about 60% of the muons survive the capture and acceleration stage .",
    "hence , about @xmath40 muons are accelerated to 10  gev per operational year .",
    "\\(v ) a muon storage ring with two long straight sections .",
    "the circumference of the ring is 448  m , and the length of the neutrino beam - forming straight section is 150  m. hence about 33% of the muon decays contribute to the neutrino beam , and there are @xmath41 neutrinos and @xmath41 antineutrinos in the beam per operational year .",
    "note that in the scenario described above the proton source provides approximately one - third of the beam power of the source required for a muon collider .",
    "the fluxes and interaction rates discussed in the following sections should be multiplied by a factor of 3.3 to obtain the results that would correspond to a muon storage ring neutrino source that utilizes the full muon collider muon source .      in the muon rest - frame the distribution of muon antineutrinos ( neutrinos ) from the decay @xmath42 + @xmath8 ( @xmath43 + @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) of polarized muons",
