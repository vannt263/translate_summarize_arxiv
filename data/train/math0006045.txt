    "it is well - known that starting from a _ move _ ( often described in terms of surgery on a link ) on a set of knotted objects ( such as knots , links , braids , tangles , 3-manifolds , graphs ) , one can define a notion of _ s_. the question of how many invariants are there in any degree gets divided into two separate questions : one that provides upper bounds for the number of invariants , and one that provides lower bounds .",
    "traditionally , upper bounds are obtained by providing a set of topological relations among the moves , whereas lower bounds are obtained by constructing ( by quite different means ) invariants .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to introduce and explore two surprises that arise when we study the first question regarding the s of 3-manifolds due , independently , to m. goussarov and k. habiro based on surgery on s , see @xcite .",
    "one surprise is that the upper bounds depend on a bit more than a choice of generators for @xmath0 .",
    "a complementary surprise a curious brane relation which shows that the upper bounds are in a certain sense independent of the choice of generators of @xmath0 .",
    "let us briefly recall that goussarov and habiro studied the notion of surgery @xmath1 of a 3-manifold @xmath2 along an ( embedded ) _ clasper _ or @xmath3-_graph _ @xmath4 , see @xcite .",
    "for a detailed definition of s and their associated surgery see @xcite or @xcite the notation of which we follow here .",
    "this notion of surgery allows one to consider the abelian group @xmath5 freely generated by ( isomorphism classes of ) 3-manifolds obtained surgery on @xmath2 , and define a decreasing filtration on it where @xmath6 is the subgroup generated by @xmath7=\\sum_{g ' \\subset \\{g_1 , \\dots , g_n \\ } } ( -1)^{|g'| } m_{g'}\\ ] ] for all s @xmath4 in @xmath2 partitioned into @xmath8 blocks @xmath9 , where for @xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes the result of surgery on the graph @xmath12 , and where @xmath13 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath14 .",
    "dually , and perhaps more naturally , this filtration allows us to call a @xmath15-valued function @xmath16 on the set of 3-manifolds obtained by surgery on s a  of type @xmath17 iff @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the question of how many s of type @xmath17 are there translates into a question about the structure of the ( graded quotient ) abelian groups @xmath19 . for the case of @xmath20 ( or any other ) , it is well - known that the topological calculus of s developed indepedently by goussarov and habiro , implies the existence of upper bounds of @xmath21 in terms of an abelian group @xmath22 generated by ( abstract ) trivalent graphs , modulo the well known antisymmetry @xmath23 and @xmath24 relations , see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) .",
    "the case of arbitrary 3-manifolds @xmath2 ( needed for instance in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 5,6,7 ) ) seems to be missing from the literature , even though the main tools are the same as in the case of @xmath20 .",
    "there are , however , two surprises in extending the above upper bound to all closed 3-manifolds , which are the main point of this paper : one is that the upper bound for @xmath21 is given in terms of a finitely generated ( in each degree ) abelian group @xmath25 defined below , where @xmath26 is a _ _ link i.e. ,",
    "an oriented framed link in @xmath2 that generates ( possibly with redundances ) @xmath27 , see theorem [ thm.1 ] .",
    "in other words , the generators of @xmath25 _ depend _ on just a bit more than a choice of generators for @xmath27 , they depend on a choice of 1-cycles .",
    "the other surprise is the existence of a new relation in @xmath25 , the _ open brane _ ( @xmath28 ) and the _ closed brane _ ( @xmath29 ) relation , which is also given in terms of a choice of embedded 2-cycles in @xmath2 .",
    "of course the choice of @xmath26 is not unique , and the choice of cycles in the @xmath28 relation is not unique , however the @xmath28 and @xmath29 relations imply that any two such choices @xmath26 and @xmath30 lead to rather canonical isomorphisms between @xmath31 and @xmath32 as well as commutative diagrams , see theorem [ thm.1 ] .    if one is willing to work with rational coefficients , then the above upper bound @xmath31 can be identified with an invariant @xmath33-group @xmath34 that depends only on the cohomology ring @xmath35 of @xmath2 , see corollary [ cor.q ] ( although the map @xmath36 still depends on a choice of a  link @xmath26 ) .    as a final comment before the details , we should mention that for s of s , or for @xmath37-valued s of rational homology spheres the above mentioned choices of 1-cycles and 2-cycles are invisible , which partly explains why they were not discovered despite the success of constructing and studying theories of s of rational homology spheres .      throughout , by _",
    "we mean we mean one with ( symmetric ) univalent and trivalent vertices , together with a choice of cyclic order on each trivalent vertex .",
    "note that graphs that contain struts , i.e. , an interval with two univalent vertices and no trivalent ones , will _ not _ be allowed here .",
    "univalent vertices of graphs will often be called _ legs _ or _",

    "this assignment can be extended linearly to include graphs each univalent vertex of which is assigned a nonzero formal linear combination of elements of @xmath38 .",

    "@xmath40 is graded , by declaring the degree of a graph to be the number of its trivalent vertices .",
    "notice that the group @xmath40 is closely related to a group that appears when one studies s of @xmath38-component links in @xmath43 , with some notable differences : one is that we do not allow struts , another is that we do not grade by half the number of vertices , and the third is that we allow graphs with no legs .",

    "for the second statement , since we are using @xmath37 coefficients , we may assume that the link @xmath26 is a basis for @xmath176 , and choose a link @xmath177 to span the torsion part of @xmath27 .",
    "then , we have that @xmath178 . there are integers @xmath179 and surfaces @xmath180 such that @xmath181 for all components of @xmath177 .",
    "the @xmath28 relation for @xmath177 colored legs gives a map @xmath182 which is independent of the choices of @xmath183 and is inverse to the map @xmath184 .",
    "thus , @xmath185 .",
    "since @xmath186 for every  link @xmath30 , the result follows .                for the first claim , recall that a degree @xmath110  @xmath4 in a manifold @xmath2 is the image of an embedding @xmath190 of a neighborhood @xmath191 of the standard ( framed ) graph @xmath192 of @xmath193 , and that surgery of @xmath2 along @xmath4 can be described as the result of dehn surgery on the six component link @xmath88 in @xmath191 shown below @xmath194 @xmath88",

    "recall also that the lmo = aarhus integral of a  @xmath197 ( obtained by surgery on a framed link @xmath88 in a  @xmath2 ) is obtained by considering the kontsevich integral @xmath196 , splitting it in a quadratic @xmath198 and trivalent ( a better name would be `` other '' ) part @xmath199 , and gluing the @xmath88-colored legs of @xmath199 using the inverse linking matrix of @xmath88 .    given a  @xmath200 in a  @xmath2 , ( where @xmath106 are of degree @xmath110 ) ,",

    "such graphs will have at least @xmath202 univalent vertices .",

    "the second claim is best shown by example .",
    "recall that surgery on the ( generic trivalent graph ) @xmath204 shown below corresponds to surgery on two s @xmath205 and @xmath206 , each with arms @xmath207 for @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "the linking matrix of the @xmath210 component link @xmath211 and its inverse are given by @xmath212 where @xmath150 is the identity @xmath213 matrix .",
    "the relevant trivalent part @xmath214 is shown schematically in four cases here , where the graphs on the left terms of each case come from @xmath205 and the graphs on the right terms of each case come from @xmath206 and the dashed lines correspond to gluings of the univalent vertices : @xmath215 however , the last three cases all contribute zero , since @xmath216 is a 3-component unlink whose coefficient in @xmath199 is a multiple of the triple milnor invariant and thus vanishes .",
    "thus , we are only left to glue terms in the first case , and this is summarized in the following figure @xmath217 which concludes the proof .",
    "( of corollary [ cor.3 ] ) if @xmath4 is as in the statement of the corollary , colored by a sublink @xmath30 of @xmath26 which is not  , then we can find an @xmath218 , and a closed surface @xmath219 such that @xmath220[y]=\\delta_{y , x}$ ] for all components @xmath221 of @xmath26 .",
    "cut @xmath4 along an edge , and color the two new leaves @xmath81 and @xmath49 to obtain a graph @xmath48 . by definition , we have @xmath222 , thus the result follows from the @xmath29 relation .",
