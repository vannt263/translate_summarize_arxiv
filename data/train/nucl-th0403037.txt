    "the year 2003 marks the 50th anniversary of the discovery of hypernucleus . in these 50 years",
    ", the physics of hypernucleus and strange hadrons has played a key role in understanding both the strong and weak interactions of quarks ( and gluons ) .",
    "starting from the eight - fold way , or the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , various symmetries of hadron spectroscopy and interactions , such as current algebra , were born from the strangeness physics . in 1990",
    "s , we have seen a marvelous development both in experimental and theoretical hypernuclear physics . it has accomplished fairly good description of the strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions of hyperons in nuclear medium .",
    "especially a series of new experimental data on the weak decays have lead us to a nearly full understanding of the mechanisms of the weak decays of the hyperon in nuclei .",
    "this is the subject of this report .    in section 2 ,",
    "i summarize the current status of various theories and models of the nonmesonic weak decay . in section 3 ,",
    "the model calculations are compared with recent experimental data . in section 4 ,",
    "i concentrate on the @xmath2 rule and argue that the rule may not be valid in the nmwd . in section 5 , conclusions are given .",
    "the weak decay of @xmath3 in hypernuclei is dominated by the nonmesonic decay modes , @xmath4 , because the mesonic decay , @xmath5 is suppressed .",
    "this is easily understood by realizing that the mesonic decay emits a nucleon of momentum , @xmath6 mev / c , and thus is suppressed by the pauli exclusion in the final states . in contrast , the nonmesonic weak decay ( nmwd ) may emit nucleons with momentum @xmath7 mev / c .",
    "this momentum corresponds to the region of the @xmath8 interaction where the short - range repulsion is important .",
    "it indicates that the nmwd of @xmath3 hypernuclei probes the short distance part of the baryonic weak interaction .",
    "the nonmesonic decay of @xmath3 is most simply realized by two kinds of the two - body decay modes , @xmath9 ( proton induced ) and @xmath10 ( neutron induced ) , while more complicated processes , like @xmath11 , may contribute .",
    "we start with the mechanism of the two - body decay modes .",
    "study of the hypernuclear weak decays showed steady but significant development in 1990 s .",
    "the progress was mostly lead by the new generation of experiments , carried out with high intensity secondary beams of mesons combined with high resolution spectrometers .",
    "new developments include measurement of the decay neutron spectrum and also back - to - back coincidence measurement .    before such progress ,",
    "our knowledge on nmwd was very limited .",
    "the simplest view was proposed just after the discovery of the hypernucleus by ruderman and karplus@xcite , where the authors considered one - pion exchange process with a @xmath12 weak vertex for the nmwd and calculated the ratio of the mesonic to nonmesonic decay rates in nuclear matter .",
    "they concluded that the then - available emulsion data are consistent only if the spin of @xmath3 is @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "later , block and dalitz@xcite compared the one - pion exchange ( ope ) process with experiment carefully .",
    "the weak coupling constants at the @xmath12 vertex are fixed by the decay rate and the asymmetry of the @xmath5 decay .",
    "it was realized that although the total decay rate is roughly reproduced the ratio of the neutron induced decay rate , @xmath15 , and the proton induced decay rate , @xmath16 , is in trouble .",
    "in fact , the large momentum transfer enhances the contribution of the tensor part of ope , which induces a strong @xmath17 transitions .",
    "because of the isospin symmetry in the final state , no tensor transition is allowed for the @xmath10 , which leads to the relation @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental data do not show this disparity between the two modes .              as the transferred momentum is high between two baryons",
    ", we expect to have shorter range interactions contribute to the nmwd .",
    "it is natural to follow the description of the strong interaction of the baryons , in which the various heavy meson exchanges are coherently added up .",
    "the @xmath19 exchange for the weak decay was first introduced by mckellar and gibson@xcite .",
    "takeuchi et al.@xcite applied their model to @xmath20 and 5 hypernuclei .",
    "these two pioneering works considered only the tensor part of the @xmath19 exchange , where the  factorization \" ansatz was used to determine the weak @xmath21 coupling constants .    later , dubach et al.@xcite proposed to employ the su(3)/su(6 ) symmetry to evaluate the weak coupling constants of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons to the octet baryons .",
    "the parity violating ( pv ) couplings of the pseudoscalar mesons are determined by the su(3 ) symmetry from the @xmath22 couplings , while the su(6 ) symmetry is required for the vector mesons and furthermore an extra parameter is introduced .",
    "the parity conserving ( pc ) part of the weak coupling is assumed to come from the baryon pole diagrams .",
    "similar assumptions have been employed in the calculation of nonleptonic decay of the hyperons .",
    "it is known , however , that they do not reproduce both the pc and pv decay rates satisfactorily .",
    "thus it is important to evaluate the weak coupling constants directly from qcd .",
    "dubach et al.@xcite analyzed the nmwd of @xmath3 in nuclear matter by employing the above prescription for the weak coupling constants .",
    "all the members of the pseudoscalar and vector nonet mesons are taken into account .",
    "the full vector meson exchanges including the central part of the interaction were considered also by parreno et al.@xcite for the calculation of the decay rates of @xmath23 .",
    "it is well known that exchanges of two pions correlated into the scalar - isoscalar meson , `` @xmath24 '' , is crucial in nuclear force to make nuclear bound states . in the weak decay , shmatikov@xcite and itonaga et al.@xcite considered @xmath25 in the scalar @xmath24 channel and @xmath19 channel .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the weak coupling constant can be estimated from the weak @xmath5 and @xmath26 vertices .",
    "the contributions are found to be sizable in the @xmath27 transitions and also in the tensor transition , although the results from the two groups do not necessarily agree with each other .",
    "as the short range baryonic interaction plays important roles , the nucleon substructure must be taken into account for the complete understanding of nmwd .",
    "the @xmath28 dependence of the hypernuclear life - times also indicates that short - range interaction plays an important role in nmwd.@xcite it is known that the short range @xmath8 repulsion comes from the quark exchange interaction.@xcite similarly , the direct quark ( dq ) weak process was introduced in order to explain the short - range part of the nmwd of hypernuclei .        in the dq calculation ,",
    "an effective hamiltonian is introduced for the weak interactions of quarks , which consists of various four - quark vertices , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the pioneering work done by cheung et al.@xcite",
    ", these operators were not correctly taken into account .",
    "maltman and shumatikov@xcite considered the @xmath31 and @xmath32 exchange with dq , and pointed out that the @xmath2 may be violated by the dq .",
    "inoue et al.@xcite showed that the dq @xmath33 exchange gives a large @xmath0 ratio , which is one of the difficulties of ope .",
    "they also pointed out that a strong @xmath34 transition is realized in the @xmath27 amplitudes .",
    "later , sasaki et al.@xcite showed that the @xmath0 ratio becomes as large as @xmath35 when we take account of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and dq exchanges .",
    "another notable approach to the baryonic weak interaction is the effective interaction approach , which was first considered by block and dalitz@xcite , and later elaborated by jun et al.@xcite and parreno et al.@xcite they are mostly phenomenological but the last one is based on the chiral effective theory .",
    "the latter can reproduce the basic features of the experimental data employing sufficient number of parameters .",
    "nuclear effects on the nmwd are considered in various aspects .",
    "the medium effects on ope and one - boson exchange ( obe ) have been studied by many groups , where the short - range correlation and final state interaction are two important effects.@xcite contribution of two - nucleon induced decay , @xmath36 , especially in extracting the @xmath0 ratio was studied by spanish groups.@xcite their results seem to agree rather well with recent experimental spectrum .     contributions .",
    "( b ) shows a coherent process.,height=226 ]    the roles of virtual @xmath37 excitation is another interesting contribution to the nmwd .",
    "it was first considered by bando et al.@xcite , who introduced the @xmath38 decay process .",
    "recently , sasaki et al.@xcite pointed out the importance of coherent @xmath37 mixing in the @xmath20 ( @xmath39 ) hypernuclei , and found that it gives 10% effects .",
    "it may be closely related to the `` overbinding '' problem of the s shell hypernuclei@xcite and is an interesting subject to pursue further .",
    "main observables in nmwd are the nonmesonic decay rates , @xmath40 , the partial rates @xmath16 , @xmath15 and the proton asymmetry parameter @xmath41 .     @xmath42&@xmath40&@xmath0&@xmath41&@xmath43&0.52&0.70&@xmath44&sasaki et al.@xciteobe ( all)&0.32&0.46&@xmath44 & parreno et al.@xcite @xmath45&0.42&0.39&@xmath46 or 0.12&itonaga et al.@xciteexp&@xmath47&@xmath48&@xmath49&kek e462/e508@xcite    [ table1 ]    the theoretical prediction of the @xmath50 ratio , @xmath0 , has a long history . in 1963 , block and dalitz showed that the ope underestimates the ratio by a factor 10 . until 1997 ,",
    "the obe with all mesons showed no improvement giving about @xmath51 .",
    "the calculation in the @xmath52 model performed in 1998 gave a larger value , 0.49 , but adding the @xmath32 exchange at that time reduced the value to 0.20 for @xmath42 .",
    "in 2000 , we found an error in the sign in the @xmath32 exchange amplitudes commonly used .",
    "the revised values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which denote the @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) transition , were shown to give a larger value of the @xmath50 ratio , 0.45 for @xmath57 and 0.70 for @xmath43 for @xmath42.@xcite the meson exchange calculations have also agreed with this conclusion .",
    "now the kek e462 and e508 experiments@xcite have successfully singled out the back - to - back decay events , which are not contaminated by the final state rescattering , and have obtained the relatively lower value of the @xmath50 ratio .",
    "finally , the theories and experiments agree with each other and the @xmath50 puzzle has been solved .",
    "the nucleon spectrum emitted from the nmwd has also been measured and compared with the theoretical one .",
    "agreement is not complete yet and it seems that we still need more realistic final state description .",
    "the remaining problem is in the proton asymmetry parameter , @xmath58 , which describes the decay proton asymmetry with respect to the polarization of @xmath3.@xcite as is shown in table 1 , theoretical calculations mostly give a large negative value , while recent experiments indicate small or positive asymmetry .",
    "future studies of nmwd may concentrate on the @xmath59 decay amplitudes , which have not been determined well experimentally nor theoretically .",
    "they are the key to understand the proton asymmetry @xmath58 and @xmath34 in nmwd .",
    "more observables are being measured in the future .",
    "one of the interesting experiments is the reversed process , i.e. , the weak production of @xmath3 in @xmath60 scattering .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath61 amplitudes may dominate the process.@xcite although the expected cross section is tiny , of the order @xmath62 , an experiment is planned at rcnp@xcite .",
    "the decay of double hypernuclei is a new and interesting subject , as this decay has a new decay modes , @xmath63 or @xmath64 , which are supposed to be dominated by the @xmath59 amplitudes.@xcite",
    "it is well known that the strangeness changing weak decay strongly favors the @xmath2 transition .",
    "the experimental ratios of the @xmath2 and @xmath34 amount to 20 in the decay amplitudes of the kaon and the hyperon . yet , the mechanism for the @xmath2 dominance is not completely understood .",
    "indeed , the standard theory of the electroweak interaction predicts the amplitudes of the same order , which can be seen from the fundamental vertex , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the final @xmath68 system has either isospin 1/2 or 3/2 with the ratio 2 to 1 , which comes from the clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "thus naive expectation contradicts with data .",
    "nonleptonic weak interaction.,width=566 ]    the difficulty is partially solved by considering the perturbative qcd corrections on the weak transition process .",
    "the one - loop qcd corrections associated with the renormalization group ( rg ) improvement are shown to enhance ( suppress ) the @xmath2 ( @xmath34 ) amplitudes.@xcite the mechanism can be understood by considering the color - flavor structure of the gluon exchange interactions between quarks .",
    "the color - magnetic attraction in the scalar diquark , @xmath56 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xmath71 , in the final state enhances the @xmath2 . also the so - called penguin diagram , which is purely @xmath2 and mixes the right - handed flavor - singlet current ,",
    "was shown to contribute significantly.@xcite    the low energy effective interaction for the nonleptonic @xmath72 decay is given in terms of various four quark operators , whose coefficients are given as the solution of the rg equation at a renormalization scale of order 1 gev .",
    "the rg equation takes into account the leading log summation and also the operator mixings .",
    "the coefficients show clearly the enhancement of the @xmath2 and the suppression of the @xmath34 vertices .",
    "unfortunately , the perturbative correction seems not sufficient in explaining the observed @xmath2 to @xmath34 ratio .",
    "the consensus is that extra 3 - 5 times enhancement is acquired from `` nonperturbative '' qcd corrections .",
    "this is formally given by the corrections to the matrix elements of the operators , which are renormalized at a scale @xmath73 gev , as all the physics above @xmath74 should be included in the coefficients .",
    "the matrix elements are to be evaluated by , for instance , the lattice qcd , effective theories , and models .    as for the @xmath2 enhancement in the @xmath32 decay , morozumi et al.@xcite proposed @xmath75 mechanism , in which @xmath24 is a scalar @xmath76 meson of mass @xmath77 mev .",
    "this process enhances the @xmath2 amplitude as the @xmath24 mass is close to the kaon mass . a model calculation based on the njl model",
    "was performed and showed that the experimental ratio can be reproduced fairly well in this mechanism.@xcite    when the hyperon decays are concerned , the @xmath2 enhancement may be understood by combination of the soft - pion relation and the color symmetry argument .",
    "miura - minamikawa@xcite and pati - woo@xcite ( mmpw ) showed that no @xmath34 amplitude comes from the weak vertex diagram in which either the initial two quarks or the final two quarks belong to the same baryon .",
    "this theorem is a consequence of the color symmetry of the constituent quarks of the baryon . for the pionic decays of hyperons ,",
    "the pv transition matrix elements can be reduced into the baryon - baryon matrix elements by the soft - pion technique , for example , @xmath78| \\lambda\\rangle   = -{i\\over 2f_{\\pi } } \\langle n| h^{\\rm pc } | \\lambda\\rangle\\ ] ] where we use the following relations satisfied by the weak effective lagrangian , @xmath79 = 0 \\qquad \\ , [ q_5 ^a , h^{\\rm pv } ] = - [ i^a , h^{\\rm pc } ] .\\ ] ] then the baryon - baryon matrix elements , ex .",
    "@xmath80 , evaluated in the constituent quark model contains only @xmath2 transitions due to the mmpw theorem . as for the pc amplitudes , contributions of the pole diagrams again guarantee the @xmath2 dominance .",
    "are the the baryon - baryon weak matrix elements large enough to explain baryon decays ?",
    "the matrix elements are sensitive to the baryon size . in the dq calculation ,",
    "the nonrelativistic quark model wave function with @xmath81 fm is used .",
    "this gives a large enough matrix element for the @xmath5 decay .",
    "the mit bag model tends to underestimate the matrix elements .",
    "the next interesting question then is whether the @xmath2 is dominant in nmwd of the hyperons . in the two - baryon weak interactions",
    ", we do not see any enhancement mechanism for @xmath2 , nor suppression of @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , it has been pointed out that the dq mechanism gives @xmath34 amplitudes comparable to @xmath2.@xcite maltman and shmatikov also suggested that the @xmath82 couplings may contain significant @xmath34.@xcite it is therefore important to check whether the @xmath34 transition is significant in the hypernuclear decays , for which a few proposal were made for the decays of the @xmath83 -shell hypernuclei @xmath20 and 5.@xcite    the @xmath84 of the weak transition will be clearly seen in the @xmath27 decay amplitudes .",
    "we define the ratio , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) denotes the proton induced decay rate for the total angular momentum @xmath88 (= 0 or 1 ) . then @xmath89 is a clear indicator of @xmath84 : @xmath90    the partial decay rates of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath42 , are the key quantities .",
    "we define two ratios of the observables : @xmath93 then the following theorem can be proved if one assumes that the nonmesonic decay is dominated by the two - body processes : +    the current experimental data are not conclusive : @xmath94 but it indicates @xmath95 and therefore possibility of violation of the @xmath2 rule .",
    "a related topic is the @xmath96 decay of hypernuclei , which is not induced by the @xmath5 decay , but needs to involve another proton .",
    "i applied the soft pion technique again to the @xmath96 emission and showed that the decay through @xmath97 is strongly hindered in the soft pion ( @xmath83 wave ) limit.@xcite instead , the @xmath34 transition gives nonvanishing matrix element in the soft pion limit , and therefore the @xmath96 emission rate is directly connected to the @xmath34 amplitudes of nmwd .",
    "thus a large @xmath96 emission rate may indicate the violation of the @xmath2 rule in nmwd .",
    "after 50 years of study , the nmwd of hypernuclei is fairy well understood in terms of the models of meson exchanges and also by taking account of the quark substructure of the baryon .",
    "the long standing problem of the @xmath0 discrepancy has been solved in cooperation of the theoretical and experimental efforts .",
    "the decay nucleon spectrum indicates strong final state interactions .",
    "yet , we still need some refinement to reproduce the proton asymmetry parameter . the predicted @xmath2 violation should be tested by experiment .",
    "it is crucial to measure @xmath98 precisely",
    ". the @xmath96 decay rate may also be useful in determining the role of @xmath34 component in nmwd .",
    "the roles of virtual @xmath37 ( and also @xmath99 in the double hypernuclei ) are left for the future study .",
    "after all , our goal is to understand the structure and dynamics of hypernuclei as well as to study the qcd corrections on the nonleptonic weak interaction in nuclei . in 2007",
    ", the j - parc is expected to start new series of hypernuclear experiments . combined studies of spectroscopy and weak decay",
    "may provide high quality data so that high precision analyses become possible .",
