    "the advantages of distributed feedback ( dfb ) is well known in laser physics . in conventional lasers",
    "dfb is formed in such a way that diffracted and transmitted waves propagate along a line in opposite directions .",
    "the distinctive feature of volume free electron lasers ( vfel ) is using of non - one - dimensional ( volume ) distributed feedback at which the diffracted wave propagates at the angle @xmath0 to the transmitted wave .",
    "firstly the idea to use volume distributed feedback ( vdfb ) for x - ray generation was proposed in @xcite .",
    "vdfb causes sharp increase of amplification and instability increment of electron beam density is proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the electron beam density and @xmath3 is the number of surplus waves appearing due to diffraction ( for example , in case of two - wave bragg diffraction @xmath4 , for three - wave diffraction @xmath5 and so on ) .",
    "this dependence essentially differs from increment for conventional fel in compton regime , which is proportional to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "now the investigation of 4-wave diffraction in system with two - dimentional dfb is also started by @xcite .",
    "sharp increase of amplification caused by vdfb yields to noticeable reduction of threshold currents necessary for lasing start .",
    "this fact is particularly important for lasing in submillimetre and visible ranges and for shorter wavelengths .",
    "explicit expressions vfel threshold currents were obtained in @xcite . in present work the dependence of vfel starting current on undulator parameters",
    "is considered .",
    "it is well known that to find amplification and starting current one should study the dispersion law of radiating system the set of equations describing interaction of relativistic electron beam , which propagates in spatially periodic structure in undulator is @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the wave vectors of photons diffracted by the crystal planes with corresponding reciprocal vectors @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the dielectric constants of a periodic structure",
    ". these constants can be obtained from the following representation of dielectric permiability of periodic structure : @xmath13 @xmath14 is the part of dielectric susceptibility appearing from the interaction of an electron beam , propagating in undulator , with radiation : @xmath15 \\nonumber \\\\ & & for\\ \\ \\   the \\ \\ \\ \" hot \" \\ \\ \\",
    "beam \\ \\ \\   limit ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is undulator period,@xmath20 is undulator field , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the velocity spread .",
    "if the inequality @xmath24 is fulfilled , all the electrons interact with electromagnetic wave and the `` cold '' limit is realized . in the opposite case ( `` hot '' limit ) @xmath25 only small part of electron beam interacts with electromagnetic wave . setting the determinant of linear system ( [ system ] ) equal to zero",
    "one can obtain the dispersion equation for the system `` electromagnetic wave + undulator + electron beam + periodic structure '' . in case of two - wave dynamical diffraction",
    "this equation has the following form : @xmath26 for the system with finite interaction length the solution of boundary problem can be presented as a sum : @xmath27 here @xmath28 are the coupling coefficients between the diffracted and transmitted waves ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 are the solutions of dispersion equation ( [ two ] ) . to determine coefficients @xmath31 it is necessary to write the boundary conditions on the system ends @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for bragg geometry , when transmitted and diffracted waves has the opposite signs of wave vector projections on the axis @xmath34 , these conditions are as follows : @xmath35 in ( [ conditions ] ) the wave vector is represented as : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 satisfies undulator synchronism condition .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ conditions ] ) are written for the `` cold '' electron beam . in this case",
    "the dispersion equation has four roots ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) .",
    "the first and the fourth conditions in ( [ conditions ] ) correspond to continuity of transmitted wave at @xmath32 and diffracted wave at boundary @xmath33 ( it is supposed that the wave with wave vector @xmath40 and amplitude @xmath41 is falling on boundary @xmath32 and the wave with wave vector @xmath42 and amplitude @xmath43 is falling on boundary @xmath33 ) . the second and the third conditions in ( [ conditions ] ) accord with the requirement that the electron beam is unpertubed before entering the interaction region . the part of electron beam energy converting to radiation can be expressed as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the length of interaction in undulator , @xmath46 is the function of generation dependence on detuning from synhronism condition , @xmath47 is detuning factor , @xmath48 is diffraction asymmetry factor , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are diffraction cosines , @xmath51 . the function @xmath52 is presented in fig.[curve ]    = 14 cm    one can see from fig.[curve ] that dependence on detuning factor @xmath53 is not asymmetric .",
    "this distinguishes lasing in the range of roots degeneration from generation process in conventional undulator fel .",
    "the latter has the following dependence on detuning factor @xcite : @xmath54 this difference ensues from interference of contribution to radiation of two diffraction roots",
    ". from ( [ energy ] ) follows that : 1 .",
    "the starting current in case of two - wave diffraction is proportional to @xmath55 ; + 2 .",
    "non - one dimensional vdfb provides the possibility to decrease the starting current of generation by varying of the angles between the waves .",
    "the dependence of @xmath56 on asymmetry factor @xmath57 is presented in fig.[ratio ] .",
    "if electron beam current is less than starting value @xmath58 then energy in electromagnetic wave at the system entrance can be written in the form :    = 14 cm    @xmath59    the conventional fel gain is proportional to @xmath60 @xcite , but as follows from ( [ ampl ] ) in case of two - wave diffraction the gain gets an additional factor @xmath61 , which noticeably exceeds the unity in conditions of dynamical diffraction .",
    "such increase of radiation output in degeneration point can be explained by the reduction of wave group velocity , which can be written as : @xmath62 it follows from ( [ group ] ) that for multi - wave dynamical diffraction in the @xmath3-fold - degeneration point @xmath63 , the starting current @xmath64 and amplification is proportional to @xmath65 . it should be noted that considered effects take place in wide spectral range for wavelengths from centimeters to x - ray ( @xcite ) and influence of effect increases with the frequency growth .",
    "the generation threshold in undulator vfel in case of vdfb can be achived at lower electron beam current and shorter undullator length when special conditions of roots degeneration are fulfilled .",
    "change of vdfb conditions by varying the volume geometry parameters ( for example , the angle between wave vectors ) gives the possibility to increase q - factor and decrease starting current ( see fig .",
    "[ ratio ] ) and , hence , the efficiency of generation can be increased .",
