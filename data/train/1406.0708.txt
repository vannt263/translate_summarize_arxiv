    "the study of young galactic clusters and hii regions is an essential tool to improve our understanding of key astrophysical processes like star formation , its modes , spatial variation , and duration ( lada & lada 2003 ) . at the same time",
    ", young star aggregates help us to probe the galactic spiral structure , being one of the most prominent spiral arm tracers , together with gas , in the form of hi , hii , or co ( carraro 2013 ) .",
    "our group has focused its attention in recent years to several directions in the fourth quadrant of the milky way see e.g. shorlin  1 @xcite , danks  1 and 2 @xcite , ngc  6193/6167 @xcite or cenob1/ngc  4755 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend our study to the remarkable ic  2944/2948 region , located at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "ic  2944 is a nebula associated to the cluster collinder  249 ( cr  249 , c1134 - 627 , or `` @xmath13 cen cluster '' ) and it is centered on the star hd  101205 .",
    "however , the designation ic  2944 is routinely used to identify the stellar group itself ( see , e.g. , @xmath14 , webda ) .",
    "the entire complex hosts the hii nebula ic  2948 and the stellar cluster cr  249 .",
    "the bright star @xmath13  cen is also located in our covered field ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dss ] ) . according to @xcite , the entire group of brightest stars in this region",
    "is also referred as cen  ob2 association .",
    "ic  2944/2948 appears then as a concentration of o stars ( several of them identified as binary systems ) and early b stars .",
    "apparently , some of them are responsible for exciting the nebula .",
    "this area also contains bok globules , that indicates the presence of an extremely young stellar population @xcite .",
    "the fundamental parameters of the various stellar groups have been matter of lively discussion in the literature , which prevented a general consensus on the star formation mode active in the region .",
    "@xcite presented photoelectric photometry in the johnson @xmath15 system and determined radial velocities for 24  stars .",
    "they found a binary fraction greater than 50% . by using these 24 objects ( 19 stars located within @xmath16 of the hd  101205 star and 5  o - type stars located outside this circle ) , they computed the following parameters : @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( @xmath6 2  kpc ) and a mean visual absorption of @xmath19/kpc in this galactic direction . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite studied several stars in this region using information in @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands , and claimed the stars to be a mere sample of early type field stars spread along the line of sight .",
    "+ there is also poor agreement on the detailed structure of the complex , and the nature of the various apparent groups :    * @xcite proposed that ob stars belong to various stellar groups at different distances along the line of sight . specifically , they identify three groups : a ) the closest at about 700  pc , b ) seven bright stars that seem connected with hii region rwc62 at 1.7  kpc , and c ) four more distant stars at 3 - 4  kpc .",
    "* @xcite suggests that the o - type stars in the field of the hii region ic  2944 constitute a physical cluster .",
    "this group of o stars is the cause of the ionisation of the surrounding region .",
    "* later , @xcite argue for the existence of a cluster , based on @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 photometry .",
    "they estimated a distance of 1.8  kpc , an age of 6.6  myr , and a reddening of @xmath26 .",
    "* @xcite studied the globules discovered by thackeray using co observations and they revealed that the two larger globules are kinematically separated , and have masses of 4 and 11 m@xmath12 .",
    "however , they did not find evidences of active star formation .",
    "accordingly , ic  2944 and ic  2948 would represent different parts of the same , large group of clouds surrounding a cluster of ob stars @xcite .",
    "* more recently , @xcite studied for the first time this region using xmm - newton data and claimed for the existence of a tight cluster .    in this paper",
    "we perform a detailed wide - field study of the region based on @xmath27 data with other complementary spectroscopic and kinematic information .",
    "we use this material to derive updated estimates of the fundamental parameters of the various stellar groups .",
    "we also analyze this field in connection with other fields located on the fourth galactic quadrant to derive information on the spiral structure in this portion of the disk .",

    "in this study we reported on a deep optical photometric study of the region surrounding ic  2944/2948 at ( @xmath1 ; @xmath2 ) . optical photometry was complemented with archival data , which include astrometry , shallow optical , ir and mid - ir photometry , and spectroscopy .",
    "this region harbors a wealth of young stars , emission nebulae , compact dark clouds and probable ysos . out of this material",
    ", we could derive the main properties of different populations located in the area .",
    "first , we could assess that there are several populations along this particular line of sight : we could describe an spreading population of b - type stars with an important range in distance , two stellar concentrations ( `` a '' and `` b '' ) located at @xmath6 2.3 and @xmath6 3.2  kpc , and some early stars ( `` c '' ) apparently representing a young population located as distant as 8  kpc .",
    "second , by focusing our attention on the main stellar concentrations , we revealed that they are hosting a relevant population of pms stars and are as young as 2 - 3  myrs .",
    "we derived their imfs and we found their slope for massive stars is low but still compatible with the standard salpeter law , and we also provided an estimate of each stellar group in @xmath10 and @xmath33 .",
    "third , we found that all o stars in these two groups share similar kinematics and their representative values are different from that expected from galactic rotation models in this part of the milky way .",
    "regarding the mentioned young background population ( `` c '' ) , we found it could had an apparent different kinematics we estimated an age of @xmath6 10  myr as a crude approximation .    finally , we compared all these populations locations and characteristic with those results obtained at similar directions of the galaxy and their are consistent with the idea of an almost tangent view along of the sagittarius - carina spiral arm .",
    "in particular , groups `` a '' and `` b '' would coincide with the near side of this arm , while group `` c '' with the far side , and the spread of b stars a continuous young population characteristic of a grand design spiral structure .",
