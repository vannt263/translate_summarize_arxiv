    "the lattice regularized approach to quantum field theory provides the best forum for the examination of the fundamental nonperturbative aspects of qcd . in the low momentum transfer regime , it is the only approach which in the foreseeable future holds a reasonable promise of confirming or rejecting the validity of qcd as the underlying theory of the strong interactions .",
    "recently , it has become possible to perform quenched qcd calculations in which all systematic uncertainties are quantitatively estimated .",
    "thus if the effects of quenching can be understood , the validity of qcd may be tested in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "of particular note is the recent determination of the qcd coupling constant , @xmath1 , from the @xmath2 mass splitting of charmonium @xcite . in this case",
    "one believes that the effects of quenching may be estimated with minimal model dependence .",
    "corrections to the utilization of the quenched approximation of qcd have been estimated and are currently the dominant source of uncertainty in the final predictions @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will continue efforts along this line through the examination of systematic uncertainties in hadron mass spectrum calculations .",
    "in particular , the importance of the two - pion induced self - energy contribution to the @xmath0-meson mass is evaluated in relation to the quenched approximation of qcd and to full qcd . in the quenched approximation ,",
    "the physics associated with two - pion intermediate states has been excluded in the numerical simulations .",
    "this investigation is motivated by recent results from the gf11 group @xcite for the low - lying hadron mass spectrum in the quenched approximation of qcd .",
    "their analysis is the first to systematically extrapolate qcd calculations to physical quark mass , zero lattice spacing and infinite volume .",
    "their predictions display an impressive agreement with experiment . of eight hadron mass ratios , six",
    "agree within one standard deviation and the remaining two ratios agree within @xmath3 .",
    "however , since the quenched approximation leaves out so much important physics , one might question whether these results are actually _ too _ good @xcite .    in the perturbative regime ,",
    "many of the effects of not including disconnected quark loops when preparing an ensemble of gauge configurations may be accounted for in a simple renormalization of the strong coupling constant .",
    "however , one also anticipates nonperturbative effects in making the quenched approximation . unlike a global renormalization of the coupling constant",
    ", these effects are expected to be channel specific .",
    "for example , the quenched approximation of qcd leaves out the physics associated with the decay of the @xmath0 meson to two pions .",
    "this physics must be accounted for and added to the quenched results prior to comparing with experimental data . moreover , the calculated hadron masses are extrapolated as a function of the pion mass squared to the point at which the pion mass vanishes using linear extrapolation functions .",
    "such an approach neglects nonlinear and indeed , nonanalytic behavior in the continuum extrapolation function .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath0-meson mass , one expects nonanalyticity associated with the onset of the two - pion cut .    _ a priori _ one does not know the relative importance of two - pion intermediate states of the @xmath0 meson in describing the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the substantial width of the @xmath0 meson at @xmath4 mev indicates its coupling to pions is not small and correspondingly these dynamics may have significant influence on the @xmath0-meson mass .",
    "geiger and isgur were the first to study the possible importance of the two - pion induced self - energy of the @xmath0 meson in relation to lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "their results are based on a string breaking quark model and predict large corrections to smooth extrapolations of the @xmath0-meson mass at approximately 70 mev .",
    "these authors were motivated by the long standing problem of qcd predictions for the @xmath5-mass ratio being too large .",
    "their hope was the two - pion induced self - energy correction would sufficiently raise the @xmath0 mass to solve this problem .",
    "however , we now understand that both the finite lattice spacing and the finite volume of the lattice act together to push up this mass ratio .",
    "current estimates @xcite for this ratio corrected to the infinite volume , continuum limit are @xmath6 in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 1.22 .    geiger and isgur @xcite advocate using the nonlinearities in the @xmath0 mass as a function of the quark mass to correct for the linear extrapolation of lattice results .",
    "we wish to stress that such a procedure is only sensible for the extrapolation of full qcd calculations . as we shall argue , the entire two - pion induced self - energy is absent in the quenched approximation and should be added on to quenched qcd results prior to comparison with experiment .",
    "we note that for the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , quenched lattice calculations of the @xmath0-meson mass would be _ reduced _ by 160 mev instead of increased by 70 mev .",
    "this would further exacerbate the `` @xmath7 problem '' discussed in their paper , rather that curing it .    in the quenched approximation",
    ", the @xmath0 meson can not decay to two light pseudoscalars . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite it is not possible to generate intermediate states of the @xmath0 meson in the quenched approximation in which one has two isovector pseudoscalars .",
    "one might worry about the presence of the light isoscalar pseudoscalar @xmath8 which fails to obtain its heavy mass in the quenched approximation @xcite .",
    "however , decay of the @xmath0 meson to a @xmath9 @xmath8 is forbidden by g - parity and decay to two @xmath8-mesons is of course forbidden by the isospin invariance of the strong interactions .",
    "hence the physics associated with two - pion intermediate states of the @xmath0 should simply be added onto the results extracted from calculations of quenched qcd , provided the lattice spacing is defined by physical observables which do not have a similar dependence on pion decays .",
    "current calculations of full qcd typically employ quark masses which place @xmath10 . as a result ,",
    "the functional form of the extrapolation function should account for the nonanalytic behavior in the @xmath0-meson mass as the two - pion cut is encountered . on the lattice , the spectral density does not have a cut but rather a series of poles at the points satisfying @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the discrete momenta allowed on the lattice . obviously , to fully account for the two - pion induced self - energy of the @xmath0",
    ", one must first extrapolate the lattice results to zero lattice spacing and infinite volume prior to extrapolating the quark masses to physical values .",
    "in evaluating the integrals describing the coupling of pions to the @xmath0 one must take into account the @xmath13 dependence of the @xmath0 to two @xmath9 coupling constant @xmath14 reflecting the internal structure of these mesons . while this @xmath13 dependence was extracted from a string breaking quark model in ref .",
    "@xcite , we elect to take a more agnostic approach and consider different methods of cutting off the integral .",
    "in particular we investigate a sharp @xmath15-function cutoff and a dipole cutoff .",
    "the underlying reason for our agnosticism is the belief that models of the sort underlying ref .",
    "@xcite are not likely to correctly describe the structure of pseudo - goldstone bosons such as the pion , as they do not incorporate chiral symmetry .",
    "while there are models of the @xmath16 vertex which incorporate chiral symmetry and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , these models are based on particular dynamical assumptions .",
    "accordingly , it is difficult to assess the reliability of such models .",
    "instead , we consider a range of possibilities for the vertex and to simplify this task , we consider convenient phenomenological forms .",
    "one other paper addressing this issue @xcite sidesteps the problems surrounding the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath14 by fixing @xmath14 to a constant and making two subtractions of the divergent integral at @xmath17 .",
    "these subtractions are absorbed into a mass and wave function renormalization .",
    "however , this approach excludes any analysis of @xmath0-meson mass extrapolations as the subtraction terms themselves have an unknown @xmath18 dependence which has been lost in the renormalization procedure .",
    "moreover , contributions from virtual two - pion states have been absorbed into the bare lattice parameters which is inconsistent with the dynamics contained in the quenched approximation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section ii the model used in examining the two - pion induced self - energy is outlined .",
    "two methods for regulating the divergent self - energy are explored . in section",
    "iii the relevance of the self - energy corrections to quenched qcd simulations is discussed .",
    "section iv addresses the quark mass extrapolation of full qcd calculations and the importance of nonlinear behavior in the @xmath0-meson mass .",
    "finally , the implications of this investigation are summarized in section v.",
    "in modeling the two - pion induced self - energy of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath19 , the standard @xmath16 interaction motivated by low - energy current algebra is used .",
    "the effective lagrange interaction has the form @xcite @xmath20 the pions are further assumed to interact exclusively through the @xmath0 channel as summarized in the following schwinger - dyson equation for the @xmath0 propagator @xmath21 where @xmath22 in landau gauge , and @xmath23 is the bare @xmath0-meson mass .",
    "the self - energy @xmath19 is defined through the solution @xmath24 where @xmath25 @xmath26 is given by the standard one loop integrals @xmath27 \\bigl [ k^2 - m_\\pi^2 + i \\epsilon \\bigr ] } - { 2 g_{\\mu \\nu } \\over k^2 - m_\\pi^2 + i \\epsilon } \\right \\ } \\ , .",
    "\\label{oneloop}\\ ] ] physically , the integral is convergent due to the momentum dependence of @xmath28 .",
    "however , this momentum dependence is unknown . in light of this uncertainty ,",
    "it is reasonable to parameterize the momentum dependence in terms of some given functional form with an adjustable parameter controlling how the function falls off as a function of momentum transfer .",
    "we consider two regulation prescriptions . in one ,",
    "we assume a monopole form for @xmath28 , and for comparison , we also consider a sharp @xmath15-function cutoff .",
    "the simplest fashion for introducing a covariant cutoff function is through the use of a dispersion relation .",
    "the second term of ( [ oneloop ] ) is @xmath29 independent and serves only to subtract the quadratic divergence of the first term in maintaining current conservation . as a result",
    ", we write a dispersion relation for @xmath30 with one subtraction at @xmath17 , @xmath31 of course , the imaginary part of @xmath19 may be easily determined using any number of techniques for rendering the integral of ( [ oneloop ] ) finite .",
    "the imaginary part is @xmath32 the value of @xmath28 at @xmath33 is fixed by equating the imaginary parts of @xmath34 at @xmath33 .",
    "the physical values @xcite @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev fix @xmath28 at @xmath37 .      to illustrate the physics associated with the real part of the self - energy we first consider the integral of ( [ disp ] ) cut off covariantly by a sharp @xmath15-function at @xmath38 .",
    "the functional form is @xmath39 where @xmath40 figure [ thetacut ] illustrates the real part of @xmath19 evaluated at @xmath33 for a variety of cutoffs ranging from slightly above @xmath41 to 4 gev@xmath42 . for small cutoffs ,",
    "most of the strength in the integral lies below the @xmath0 mass and consequently the @xmath0 mass is pushed up due to the mixing with pion states .",
    "of course , this behavior is completely consistent with that anticipated by simple quantum mechanical arguments . for larger cutoffs the strength above the @xmath0 mass acts to reduce the @xmath0 mass .",
    "while the @xmath15-function is useful as an illustrative tool , it suffers from being physically artificial and the results can be very sensitive to the value of the cutoff , as illustrated in figure [ thetacut ] . in an attempt to better represent the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath28 a monopole form for each vertex",
    "is introduced and the dispersion relation of ( [ disp ] ) is evaluated with @xmath43 this form maintains the normalization of @xmath28 defined at the physical @xmath0 mass and renders the integral of ( [ disp ] ) finite .    of course , this approach is not without a few unphysical side effects .",
    "the most obvious problem is the introduction of spurious poles in the space like region for the @xmath44 dependence of @xmath28 .",
    "however , the dispersion integral only samples the time like region and the presence of these unphysical poles should not affect the results .",
    "one could consider other functional forms .",
    "however , the effective physical value for the regulator mass , @xmath45 , is itself unknown .",
    "our aim is to estimate the importance of the two - pion induced self - energy relative to the @xmath0 mass , as opposed to attempting to evaluate the actual correction . for this reason we view a consideration of the dipole regulator to be adequate .",
    "evaluation of the dispersion relation of ( [ disp ] ) with ( [ gqdep ] ) leads to the following functional form for the real part of @xmath19 @xmath46 where @xmath47 the imaginary part is recovered as in ( [ imsigma ] ) .",
    "figure [ drhomass2gev ] illustrates the real part of the self - energy and its derivative with respect to @xmath48 at @xmath49 gev@xmath42 .",
    "the derivative clearly displays the nonanalytic behavior encountered at @xmath50 .",
    "the second derivative is discontinuous at @xmath50 and is infinite from above .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy is also illustrated in figure [ drhomass2gev ] .",
    "a comparison with figure [ thetacut ] indicates that at @xmath51 gev@xmath42 the results are not too sensitive to the manner in which the integral is regulated .",
    "figure [ drhomass ] illustrates the real part of the self - energy for the same values of @xmath52 used in figure [ thetacut ] .",
    "the sensitivity of the results to the value of @xmath45 is greatly reduced and all curves display the same qualitative behavior .    in the limit of @xmath53 both ( [ sigmacut ] ) and ( [ sigmadip ] )",
    "reduce to @xmath54 displaying the logarithmic divergence as @xmath55 .",
    "the effects of quenching qcd may be categorized as perturbative or global effects and nonperturbative or channel specific effects . as discussed in the introduction , the effects in the perturbative regime",
    "may be accounted for through a simple renormalization of the coupling constant .",
    "however , the effects in the nonperturbative regime will , of course , be channel specific .",
    "the @xmath0-meson channel might be particularly vulnerable to the nonperturbative effects of quenching qcd due to the fact that the @xmath0 is unstable in full qcd and stable in the quenched approximation . as we shall see however , our estimated `` unquenching '' corrections turn out to be rather small .",
    "figure [ gf11 ] displays @xmath0 and squared pion masses for the three lightest quark masses used in the quenched qcd analysis of the gf11 group @xcite for the @xmath56 lattice at @xmath57 for 219 configurations .",
    "the dashed line illustrates the linear relationship assumed in extrapolating the hadron masses to the critical point where the pion mass vanishes .    provided the lattice spacing",
    "is defined by physical observables which do not have a similar dependence on pion decays , the physics associated with two - pion intermediate states of the @xmath0 should simply be added onto the results extracted from calculations of quenched qcd .",
    "the correction is particular to the @xmath0 meson and is unlikely to be accounted for if the lattice spacing is fixed by the nucleon mass for example .",
    "the solid line of figure [ gf11 ] illustrates the addition of the self - energy correction to the linear extrapolation where the regulator mass @xmath58 gev@xmath42 has been selected @xcite .",
    "this choice of @xmath45 is physically motivated and indicates the correction to the @xmath0 mass at the physical point is negligible .",
    "the dot - dashed curve illustrates the correction when @xmath51 gev@xmath42 .",
    "figure [ drhomass ] indicates that @xmath19 is less than 6% of the squared @xmath0 mass for @xmath59 gev@xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to a less than 3% correction to the @xmath0 mass itself .",
    "the conclusion that may be drawn from this analysis , which differs from previous considerations of these issues , is that the predictions of the gf11 group @xcite are not `` too good to be true '' .",
    "the channel specific nonperturbative correction to the @xmath0-meson mass may actually be rather small .",
    "the magnitude of the corrections estimated here is much smaller than that anticipated in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite for any reasonable choice of @xmath45 . geiger and isgur",
    "predict an unquenching correction to the @xmath0 mass of approximately @xmath60 mev in contrast to our prediction of a 0 to 25 mev reduction of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "in full qcd simulations , the two - pion induced self - energy corrections are , of course , already included .",
    "however , the continuum predictions derived here will differ from those anticipated on the lattice @xcite largely due to the discretization of the momenta on the lattice and the lattice regularization itself .",
    "this renders the divergent integral of ( [ oneloop ] ) to a finite sum over a few two - pion states .",
    "in fact , if one hopes to recover the continuum physics , it will be necessary to first correct the hadron masses determined at unphysical quark masses to the continuum , infinite volume limit prior to extrapolating to physical quark masses .",
    "figure [ gf11 ] suggests that it may be extremely difficult to see the effects of virtual two - pion intermediate states in full qcd . since a great deal of the integral strength",
    "is lost for current lattice regularization parameters , the correction curve in figure [ gf11 ] is most likely an optimistically large deviation from the linear relation . even when full qcd calculations reach the current state of quenched calculations , it is questionable whether one will be capable of discerning the effects of virtual two - pion states of the @xmath0 while the @xmath0 is stable . of course",
    ", once the @xmath0 becomes unstable and decays to two pions , the lower lying two - pion states will need to be subtracted from the correlation function prior to extracting the @xmath0 mass .",
    "this renders an examination of the @xmath0-meson mass above the two - pion cut nearly impossible .",
    "it should be mentioned that these arguments support the recent findings of ref .",
    "@xcite where an attempt to observe the effects of virtual pion states in @xmath0 correlation functions failed .",
    "ultimately , full qcd calculations will reach the point where linearly extrapolating the @xmath0 mass to physical quark masses ignoring nonanalytic effects will introduce a relevant systematic error . to this end",
    "we present figure [ dcorrrhomass ] which illustrates the relative amount which should be added onto the @xmath0 mass extracted from a linear extrapolation of full qcd data corrected to the continuum , infinite volume limit @xcite .",
    "we remind the reader that these effects are being calculated using the dipole form for the cutoff which we have more or less arbitrarily chosen .",
    "thus the curves are illustrative only .",
    "the @xmath61-axis indicates the point at which the derivative is determined for the linear extrapolation .",
    "values for @xmath52 are as in figures [ thetacut ] and [ drhomass ] .",
    "for example , if the effective physical value for @xmath52 is 1 gev@xmath42 and the derivative is determined at @xmath62 gev@xmath42 , the @xmath0 mass extracted from a linear extrapolation should be augmented by approximately 25 mev prior to comparing with experiment .",
    "the size of the corrections to linear extrapolations illustrated in figure [ dcorrrhomass ] are generally smaller than the 70 mev addition predicted by geiger and isgur .",
    "however , it is possible to recover a correction to the @xmath0-meson mass extrapolation similar in magnitude to that of geiger and isgur s analysis , provided one linearly extrapolates from the onset of the cut as in their investigation .",
    "of course , it is not practical to extrapolate from the onset of the cut in actual lattice calculations .",
    "in fact , figure [ dcorrrhomass ] indicates that this is the worst possible place to attempt an extrapolation to physical quark masses .",
    "the derivative is more likely to be averaged from a number quark masses corresponding to squared pion masses of 0.2 to 0.6 gev@xmath42 .",
    "hence the corrections are expected to be the order of 10 to 20 mev and possibly negligible if the effective physical value for @xmath52 is 2 gev@xmath42 or more .",
    "an important point to mention here is that a simple calculation of the @xmath0-meson mass in full qcd will not circumvent the problems associated with its decay to pions .",
    "in fact , as one works hard to drive down the quark mass , linear extrapolations to the physical point will increasingly underestimate the @xmath0 mass .",
    "determination of the last few percent of the physical @xmath0-meson mass requires additional information describing the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath16 interactions such that a suitable extrapolation function may be identified .",
    "fortunately , these corrections are small and may be neglected until systematic uncertainties associated with the finite volume and finite spacings of the lattice are understood and eliminated .",
    "we have calculated the two - pion induced self - energy correction to the @xmath0-meson mass in a manner that allows an estimation of the correction to quenched qcd calculations and an analysis of extrapolations of full qcd results .",
    "the analysis of full qcd extrapolations indicates linear extrapolations of typical @xmath0-meson masses extracted from lattice correlation functions will underestimate the physical @xmath0 mass by 10 to 20 mev .",
    "an important point to draw from the analysis is that as the quark masses become lighter , linear extrapolations to the physical point will increasingly underestimate the @xmath0-meson mass .",
    "we estimate the corrections to quenched calculations to be the order of a few percent and quite possibly negligible ( 0 to @xmath63 mev ) .",
    "these results lend credence to the success of quenched qcd in describing the physical low - lying hadron mass spectrum .",
