    "the last decade has seen the emergence of large collections of time series data from searches for microlensing , e.g. , macho ( @xcite ) , ogle ( @xcite ) , and exoplanets , e.g. , corot ( @xcite ) , kepler ( @xcite ) , as well as legacy variability collections , e.g. asas ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the first time , these are amenable to statistical and machine learning - based analyses , particularly for classification and outlier detection , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , with an eye to the new generation of synoptic sky surveys , e.g. , crts ( @xcite ) , ptf ( @xcite ) , pan - starrs ( @xcite ) , and lsst ( @xcite ) , which will increase the amount of available data by several orders of magnitude .",
    "these surveys are also not unique to optical wavelengths with efforts underway across the electromagnetic spectrum  lofar and ska and its pathfinder precursor projects in the radio , ir , x - ray  as well as in the more exotic regimes of particle astrophysics ( neutrino ) and gravitational waves ( ligo ) .",
    "although many different approaches have been attempted , they all follow the same basic pattern : characterization , categorization , and classification .",
    "time series vary widely in their temporal coverage , sampling rates and regularity , number of points and error bars , making a very disparate data set .",
    "comparing raw light curves is therefore difficult ; rather a representation of each light curve in a given data collection in terms of a feature set is required for any analysis .",
    "there is no standardized set ",
    "somewhere around 100 different features have been used or suggested in the literature for characterizing time series , e.g. , moments , flux and shape ratios , variability indices , etc .  but many of them rely on a derived period for an object , even when it does not necessarily display any periodic behaviour .",
    "@xcite show a @xmath011% misclassification error rate for non - eclipsing variable stars with an incorrect period .",
    "@xcite also estimate that periodic feature routines account for 75% of the computing time used in their time series characterization .",
    "this irregularity means that astronomical time series data does not lend itself to the standard fourier - based analysis techniques that are found in general statistics literature .",
    "consequently , there is a long history in period finding algorithms with common ones based upon discrete fourier transform ( @xcite ) , or a least - squares approximation to it ( ls ; @xcite ) , string length ( @xcite , phase dispersion ( pdm ; @xcite ) , and analysis of variance ( aov ) methods ( @xcite ) , as well as a host of others ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "obviously with so many different methods , the question arises as to which one is the best , if any .",
    "@xcite used numerical simulations to compare discrete fourier transforms , string length and phase dispersion methods and found that none of them was superior to the others .",
    "@xcite compared model function and phase binning methods using hypothesis - testing theory to evaluate their relative sensitivity to different kinds of signals .",
    "he found that the methods using smooth model functions , such as ls , are more sensitive than those using the step function , i.e. , phase binning , and that sensitivity increases for models that more closely fit features in the signal with the orthogonal multiharmonic aov method ( aovmhw ; @xcite ) being optimal .",
    "he also found that a number of methods relying on phase binning are equivalent for the same number of bins .",
    "similarly , @xcite argues that pdm methods should be regarded simply as approximations to the fourier method ( ls ) and that the latter should be viewed as the periodogram technique of choice . @xcite",
    "have compared discrete fourier , ls and pdm techniques for recovering the rotation periods of solar - like stars from irregular time sampling of _ gaia _ using synthetic time series .",
    "they find that ls is the most efficient method with at best a recovery rate of @xmath1% .",
    "@xcite report that a single method can lead to a recovery fraction of around 80% but do not specify to what degree of accuracy .",
    "they also suggest that an ideal combination of all methods could potentially raise that value to close to 100% but can not identify the automated strategy for predicting which method leads to the correct period for a specific light curve . however , they propose , as a first step , a combination of unweighted and weighted lomb - scargle , depending on the skewness of a source s magnitude distribution .    in this work ,",
    "we present a detailed comparison of the most commonly used period finding algorithms and their efficiencies against observable parameters .",
    "this is the first survey using real rather than simulated data ( so with noise , gaps , etc . ) to consider both a wide range of variable stellar classes and light curves generated by different sampling strategies .",
    "it is hoped that we can identify the most effective algorithm with a particular view to the next generation of survey projects which require automated and efficient period finding methods .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we describe the data sets that form the basis of our analysis whilst in section 3 , we present the algorithms that we are considering here . we analyze and discuss our results in sections 4 and 5 and present our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we also have provided implementation details about opencl - based versions of the lomb - scargle and generalized lomb - scargle algorithms in an appendix .",
    "in this analysis , we consider three sets of light curves , drawn from different surveys  crts , asas , macho , which we take to be representative of the bulk of ground - based light curve data sets currently available and characteristic of future large samples such as lsst . together",
    "these span a magnitude range of @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ magst ] ) and a sampling of up to @xmath3 observations ( see fig .",
    "[ counts ] ) over a baseline of up to @xmath4 years .",
    "details of the three are summarized in table  [ datasumm ] .",
    "all observation times are converted to heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) from mjd .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the results in the previous section show that at best period finding algorithms can recover the period of a regularly periodic object with a reasonable degree of accuracy ( an equivalent phase offset between @xmath5 and @xmath6 days@xmath7 , say , over a 10-year baseline ) in only about 50% of cases .",
    "if one is only interested in detecting periodic behaviour , i.e. the period or a ( sub)harmonic , then rates of @xmath8% are achievable . for objects which do not show simple periodicity , i.e.",
    ", they are semi - periodic , quasi - periodic or multi - periodic , the situation is broadly much worse , typically only around 1020% of cases .",
    "of course , the fundamental assumption underlying this analysis is that the quoted period is correct .",
    "we have been careful , however , to use data sets where all the light curves have been inspected and the periods confirmed visually .    it should be noted that many of the algorithms score very highly when tested on simulated periodic signals , typically sinusoids with gaussian noise ; the problem seems to come with real data . for many objects , quoted periods",
    "would have originally been determined from a small number of observations over a short time baseline .",
    "the advent of large - scale synoptic sky surveys means that hundreds of observations over baselines of 5 to 10 years are now readily available and future projects such as lsst will extend this to baselines of a couple of decades .",
    "the digitization of the harvard plate library ( dasch ) offers multidecade baselines for many objects as do other similar historical collections . at the other end of the scale , exoplanet searches and space astroseismology projects , such as superwasp , kepler and corot , are providing ( very ) high resolution samplings of a few periodic cycles over periods of days and months .",
    "this wealth of new information allows the long - term stability of periods to be examined as well as intra-/intercycle variations and is now suggesting that , even for astrophysical objects exhibiting periodicity , a single value is not capable of characterizing their temporal behaviour .",
    "kepler results have shown that 60% of dwarf stars are more variable than the sun and probably pulsating variables ( @xcite ) .",
    "rr lyrae are one of the most populous of pulsating variables and employed as standard candles in studies of galactic structure .",
    "however , it has long been known that @xmath9 exhibit a long - term , generally quasi - periodic modulation of widely varying strength known as the blazhko effect . studies of variable stars in m3 now show that about a third of rr lyrae display blazhko behaviour and the discovery of small amplitude cycle - to - cycle modulations of rrabs ( @xcite ) , in addition to blazhko effects , cautions that large surveys may have seriously underestimated the number of modulated rr lyrae stars .    for other populous classes ,",
    "the situation is equally as complicated with many types of variables showing cyclic period changes over multidecade baselines , such as close binary systems ( @xcite ) and long period variables ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite note that a subgroup of semi - regular variables show very clear double periods . in some cases",
    "the longer period may be due to orbital effects indicating that the star is in a binary system .",
    "other semi - regular variables apparently show multiperiodicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but in general it is not clear whether these stars are truly multiperiodic , chaotic or both , although the actual existence of irregular , i.e. , non - periodic , variables among red giants is in dispute ( @xcite ) .",
    "the traditional approach to characterizing periodicity variation is the o - c diagram ( e.g. , @xcite ) which tracks the evolution of the time of appearance of a feature ( say the light curve maximum ) relative to the corresponding multiples of the period .",
    "the functional form of the period change ( @xmath10 ) determined from it can be used in principle to infer the physics of the situation , e.g , a steadily increasing pulsation period implies an expanding star ; however , stochastic evolution , e.g. , the mean period follows a random walk , can produce equivalent effects in the o - c diagram and distinguishing between the two is an area of active research ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the method can not be applied to long - period pulsating variables where the intrinsic scatter of the period is usually comparable to the experimental error in the period determination ( @xcite ) .",
    "it also has issues with multiperiodic light curves and those with strong modulation .",
    "alternate approaches rely on techniques from communication and signal processing theory , e.g. , wavelets ( @xcite ) , carrier signals ( @xcite ) and other time frequency analysis methods . though these can be very powerful , they are complicated and it is difficult to distill the results down to a single useful characterizing feature , akin to the period .",
    "it is possible that the first derivative of the period as a measure of periodicity variation or the ( largest ) lyapunov exponent to describe the degree of chaos in a time series ( @xcite ) may be suitable ; however , further discussion of these is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "another issue potentially affecting the results in this paper is that of object misclassification or class uncertainty . @xcite",
    "only assign a period to eclipsing binaries and ellipsoidal variables once the object type has been determined ( to mitigate the half - period issue with these objects ) .",
    "our results support this as a viable strategy for the ls / gls algorithms : the improvement seen on our combined data set is @xmath11 recovery to @xmath12 whereas other algorithms show a significant drop .",
    "the biggest source of error , however , will be those objects that have been misidentified as eclipsing variables , although this could be mitigated by a high classification accuracy for eclipsing binaries . whilst a detailed discussion on object classification is beyond the scope of this paper",
    ", we will note a few points .",
    "the macc classes that we employ for the asas data use a probabilistically determined 28-term scheme whilst the original acvs classifications for the same objects used 439 different categories ( different combinations and permutations of a set of about 20 terms ) , although 60% of objects were classified as ` misc ' .",
    "one of the hardest classes to distinguish between is rr lyrae with fundamental overtones ( rrc ) and w umas ( ec ) and the effect of misidentification would be that a half - period ( for a w uma ) is reported as the true period ( for a rrc ) .",
    "12% of macc w umas are considered to be rrcs by acvs and about 10% vice versa , although in only a handful of cases are the probabilities of both classes within 5% .",
    "the macho data set shows a similar level of misclassification ( @xmath13 ) between the provided object type ( rr ) and the macho assigned class ( eclipsing binary ) .",
    "we therefore estimate that there may be @xmath13 error in the class - based results arising from misassigned object types .",
    "note , however , that if data from more than one band is available then these types can be better distinguished with pca ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible to use additional data to check the classifications , e.g. , t tauri / haebe stars and any massive star classes should be near the plane .",
    "wtts objects in the asas data set do not correspond very well with the plane or nearby star forming regions casting doubt on the reliability of these classifications ( feigelson , private communication ) .",
    "we have also compared the reported periods for objects against the expected period ranges for their class drawn from @xcite and object definitions in vsx .",
    "we find that of the 41299 objects in the combined data set for which we have ranges , 40052 have periods which lie within the expected class ranges .",
    "this is certainly well within the @xmath13 misclassification error we have estimated and suggests that class uncertainty is not a significant issue in this analysis .",
    "we note , however , that coupling classification and period finding may produce more accurate results , e.g. , @xcite finds improved classifications using a weighting scheme based on the period - folded light curve .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the performance and dependencies of the most popular period finding algorithms against a comprehensive set of light curves .",
    "we find that :    * all methods are dependent on the quality of the light curve and show a decline in period recovery with lower quality light curves as a consequence of fewer observations , fainter magnitudes and/or noisier data and an increase in period recovery with higher object variability ; * all algorithms are stable with a minimum bin occupancy of  10 ( assuming @xmath14 ) ; * a bimodal observing strategy consisting of pairs ( or more ) of short @xmath15 observations per night and normal repeat visits is better than single observations with normal repeats ; * a minimum frequency step of @xmath16 is sufficient ; * the algorithms work best with pulsating and eclipsing variable classes ; * straightforward ensemble methods show no improvement over single algorithms .",
    "we also confirm that ls / gls are strongly effected by the half - period issue for eclipsing binaries and find that pdm2 has issues with irregular sampling of light curves and that aovmhw and ce work well at bright magnitudes ( containing saturated values ) .",
    "finally , in terms of overall performance factors considered here - greatest period recovery and time - ce is the best algorithm with aov and pdm viable alternatives .",
    "new and better techniques may be proposed that change the findings of this analysis . to keep track of these ,",
    "we intend to maintain an online version of this work , updating it as appropriate .",
    "if anyone has an algorithm that they would like to see included then they should get in touch with us .",
