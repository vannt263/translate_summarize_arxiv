    "quantum oscillations and evolution in shapes of fermi surfaces with various parameters have been recognized as key issues in studies of high temperature superconducting cuprates and other strongly correlated materials @xcite . in general , these systems show many coexisting and competing order parameters and collective fluctuations . a number of theoretical studies @xcite have shown that several such orders leading to broken symmetry , such as spin - density waves , charge - density waves , @xmath5-density waves or pair - density waves cause a partial or complete gapping of the fermi surface with substantial , in some cases even topological , changes in the fermi surface geometry in the transition region . in the cuprate family of materials ,",
    "the role of such changes in fermi surfaces in providing a quantitative understanding of the quantum oscillation measurements remains a hot topic @xcite .",
    "the interplay of these orders with high temperature superconductivity , non - fermi liquid behavior and pseudogap also remain subjects of intense current research @xcite .",
    "controlled microscopic calculation of properties of strongly correlated electron systems , such as hubbard and t - j models , remains a challenging task .",
    "while quantum monte carlo methods remain the most powerful for some models @xcite , in many cases they suffer from ` minus - sign ' problems , which severely restricts simulations at low temperatures .",
    "recently developed variational methods that build in low ground - state entanglement , such as density matrix renormalization group @xcite and tensor - network methods @xcite are promising , but much progress remains to be achieved .",
    "high temperature expansions @xcite and numerical linked cluster methods @xcite can obtain temperature dependent properties in the thermodynamic limit , but have found it difficult to address ground state and low temperature properties of these systems .",
    "much quantitative information on hubbard and t - j models still comes from exact diagonalization of rather small systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus attention on charge density wave ( cdw ) order in a triangular - lattice system relevant to a number of organic molecular crystals as well as to the sodium cobaltate family of materials @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that over a wide range of electron density , these systems may be described as a pinball liquid , where there is a background commensurate cdw order@xcite on the triangular - lattice corresponding to a @xmath0 or @xmath6 filling , while the rest of the electrons or holes form a metallic fermi - liquid that move in the background of such an order @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that for very strong on site hubbard repulsion @xmath7 , where double occupancy is strongly disfavored , it may suffice to model the charge fluctuations in the system in terms of spinless fermions @xcite . in this paper , we will study this specific model at a commensurate @xmath0 filling . while the extension to spinful fermions is conceptually straightforward",
    ", the much larger hilbert space of the spinful problem could severely limit the efficacy of series expansions .",
    "we also find that fairly high orders in the series are necessary for convergence even further away from the critical point .",
    "our results are based on two types of exact zero - temperature series expansions @xcite , carried out to high orders , as well as a mean - field treatment of the electron - electron repulsion .",
    "unlike the square - lattice case , where nesting causes order to develop at infinitesimal @xmath8 , on the triangular - lattice , at small @xmath8 , the ground state of the system remains a fermi liquid . only beyond a critical @xmath8 one",
    "obtains a commensurate cdw order . in the latter phase ,",
    "we expand ground state and low lying spectral properties in powers of @xmath9 . for a second expansion",
    "we introduce a sublattice - dependent chemical potential @xmath3 , which favors occupancy of one sublattice over the other two . in a real material ,",
    "such a term can arise from having two types of atoms , or from two different local environments in a unit cell .",
    "this allows us to carry out a different series expansion in inverse powers of the chemical potential .",
    "the chemical potential term can also arise from a self - consistent mean - field treatment of the charge - density wave order and this latter approach allows us to obtain a more complete picture of the evolution of the fermion excitation properties in the transition region .",
    "the picture that emerges for the electronic states across the transition is a very rich one . if we consider the non - interacting system with @xmath10 and examine it as a function of @xmath11 , we find that the gap first opens at ` hot spots ' which correspond to the points in k - space where the non - interacting fermi surface crosses the reduced brillouin zone , analogous to many recent modeling of the cuprates @xcite .",
    "this creates a topological change in the fermi surface breaking it up into many alternating electron and hole like pockets .",
    "eventually , when a full gap opens , the system becomes an indirect gap charge density wave semiconductor .",
    "however , the @xmath4 system shows a very different behavior .",
    "coming from the cdw side in self - consistent mean - field theory , we find that as the indirect band - gap is closing , the order parameter jumps to zero .",
    "thus , one obtains a discontinuous change from a non - interacting fermi surface to a gapped phase .",
    "one should note that the cdw order in our system has the symmetry of a 3-state potts model and in @xmath12 and higher dimensions the latter model is known to have a weakly first order transition @xcite .    at small @xmath9 and @xmath13 ,",
    "the low energy particle excitations are first centered around the @xmath14 point .",
    "however , as @xmath9 is increased a more prominent minima develops near the edges of the reduced brillouin zone . as the transition away from the charge density wave phase",
    "is approached , the particle hole excitation becomes soft all across the reduced brillouin zone boundary .",
    "we find good agreement from the results of the two different series expansions .",
    "we also find that adjusting a parameter in the self - consistent mean - field theory can make it quantitatively accurate for the ground state energy and the charge density wave order parameter .",
    "the spectra at small @xmath9 are relevant to the theoretically postulated pinball liquid phase away from @xmath0 filling . at half filling for a system of spinless fermions , the pinball liquid phase was found to be stable only for small @xmath15 , where @xmath16 was estimated to lie between @xmath17 and @xmath18.@xcite at larger @xmath9 values there was a phase transition to stripe - order and other phases .",
    "it is clear that the pinball liquid phase would be stable to larger values of @xmath9 as the particle density is reduced towards @xmath0 , eventually at @xmath0 filling the transition happens at the mean - field value obtained in this study @xmath19 . in a rigid - band picture , the additional particles beyond @xmath0 filling would occupy the particle excitation bands we have calculated .",
    "our results should become exact as the doping beyond @xmath0 filling goes to zero .",
    "our study is possibly relevant to organic molecular crystals as well as to the sodium cobaltate family of materials .",
    "charge order with @xmath0 or @xmath6 occupation have frequently been suggested but not clearly established @xcite in these materials .",
    "one advantage of the former system is that they are very pressure sensitive and the degree of strong correlation can be changed continuously by pressure thus driving the system across various quantum phase transitions .",
    "however , it is difficult to change the carrier concentration in these materials , which are generally quarter or half filled . in contrast , in the sodium cobaltate family , doping can be achieved by various substitutions as well as by water intercalation .",
    "there have also been meaurements of angle resolved photoemission spectra for the latter materials @xcite . however , although theoretically postulated , such a charge density wave state has not been convincingly seen in experiments .",
    "when such a transition is present , our work can form the basis for understanding the fermion spectra .",
    "our results are most directly applicable to a spin polarized system or an artificially engineered cold atomic gas system with only one fermionic spin species .",
    "they also provide an example where density wave induced changes in fermi surface properties and limitations of mean - field approaches can be systematically explored .",
