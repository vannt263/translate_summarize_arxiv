    "gravitational anomalies observed in large astronomical bodies are experimentally well established and are often interpreted as an excess in mass over the visible matter by more than a factor of five .",
    "dark matter ( dm ) is at present detected only by these gravitational effects and in the cosmic microwave background and its nature remains as yet unknown .",
    "it is also well established that baryons can only contribute minutely to dm  @xcite .",
    "there are several well motivated models in which dm consists of new particles belonging to a secluded gauge sector under which the sm particles are uncharged  @xcite . in the minimal setup ,",
    "the new interaction is mediated by a new gauge vector boson , the @xmath0 boson . ] , which can kinetically mix with the ordinary photon through high - order diagrams , providing therefore a small coupling between the @xmath0 and sm particles  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can be parametrized by a single mixing parameter , @xmath10 , equal to the ratio of dark and standard model electromagnetic couplings  @xcite . recently ,",
    "the existence of a @xmath0 boson of mass @xmath11(1gev ) and @xmath10 in the range 10 - 2;10 - 7 ; , has been advocated to explain several puzzling effects observed in astrophysics experiments , which fail standard astrophysical interpretations  @xcite .",
    "high luminosity  colliders are ideal tools for the search of the @xmath0 boson  @xcite because they provide a clean environment and good understanding of background .",
    "a particularly clean channel is the reaction @xmath12 followed by the decay @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "production of @xmath0 boson would result in a peak in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum .",
    "currently , the @xmath15 production process allows one to reach a sensitivity of the mixing parameter @xmath10 in the range 10 - 3;10 - 2 ; , for @xmath0-boson masses , @xmath16 , up to a few gev  @xcite .",
    "the search for a @xmath0-boson signal described in the following employs data collected in 2002 with the kloe detector at , running at the -meson peak , with an integrated luminosity of 239.3 pb-1;. we limit our search to the muon channel , searching for a peak in the dimuon mass spectrum .",
    "the process @xmath17  receives a very large contribution from the reaction @xmath17 with additional photon emission by electrons or muons , usually called initial and final state radiation or isr and fsr .",
    "kinematical and geometrical cuts strongly suppress the fsr contribution .",
    "the isr contribution can be written as @xmath18where @xmath19 is the differential cross section for @xmath20 as a function of the dimuon invariant mass @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the radiator function .",

    "the kloe detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber ( dc )  @xcite , surrounded by a lead scintillating - fiber electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc )  @xcite . a superconducting coil around the emc provides a 0.52 t magnetic field along the bisector of the colliding beams .",
    "the bisector is taken as the @xmath26 axis of our coordinate system .",
    "the @xmath27 axis is horizontal , pointing to the center of the collider rings and the @xmath28 axis is vertical , directed upwards .",

    ". the trigger uses both emc and dc information .",
    "events used in this analysis are triggered by at least two energy deposits larger than 50 mev in two sectors of the barrel calorimeter  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath37 candidate must have two tracks of opposite charge , with the point of closest approach to the @xmath26 axis within a cylinder of radius 8 cm and length 15 cm centered at the interaction point .",
    "we require two tracks to be emitted at large polar angle , @xmath38 , and an undetected photon whose momentum , computed from the two track values according to the @xmath37 kinematics , points at small angle ( @xmath39 )  @xcite .",
    "these requirements limit the range of @xmath40 to be larger than 500  mev .",
    "this separation between the tracks and photon - emission regions greatly reduces the contamination from the resonant process @xmath41 , where charged pions are misidentified as muons and the @xmath42 mimics the missing momentum of the photon(s ) , and from the fsr processes @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "isr photons are strongly peaked along the beam line .",
    "the above requirements are also satisfied by @xmath45 radiative bhabha events .",
    "a particle identification estimator ( ) , based on a pseudo - likelihood function using time - of - flight and calorimeter information ( size and shape of the energy deposit ) is used to obtain additional separation between electrons and pions or muons  @xcite .",
