    "the average rate of galaxy growth , measured by the volume averaged star formation rate ( sfr ) , was a factor of @xmath910 higher at @xmath10 than it is today ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , when the environments destined to become the most massive ( @xmath11m@xmath1 ) clusters were still in the process of assembly .",
    "what effect does the growth of large scale structure at @xmath10 have on the star formation histories of galaxies bound to , or being accreted onto , such environments ? for over 30 years it has been known that the fraction of blue star - forming galaxies in clusters was higher in the past ( @xcite ) , and more recent work has extended star formation surveys of distant clusters into the infrared ( ir ) regime ( important for tracking the total sfr ) , reinforcing the view that there has been strong evolution in the total sfr of clusters since @xmath10 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) . to some extent",
    "the evolution seen in cluster populations tracks the field , but it is important to consider the environmental context of this evolution ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , since star - forming galaxies within high-_z _ clusters are destined to evolve into the ` red sequence ' in the cores of the descendants of such environments today ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is becoming clear that clusters exist at @xmath10 that already contain an established population of massive galaxies that formed their stellar populations quickly at much higher redshifts ( @xmath8 ) when the cluster was in a much earlier state of collapse ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "while this rapid formation episode puts in place the massive tail of the cluster galaxy population , the dwarf end of the red sequence undergoes significant evolution via the continuous accretion of satellite galaxies , with the bulk of such assimilation in the form of dwarf galaxies at @xmath12 , steepening the faint - end slope of the luminosity function ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "what is the intermediate stage of red - sequence evolution at @xmath10 and what role , if any , does the _ assembly _ of the clusters themselves play on their member galaxies ?",
    "for example , is star formation triggered by , or at least associated with , the peripheral environments ( outlying groups and filaments ) feeding those massive clusters ?    in this letter we discuss observations performed with the esa _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have discovered a remarkable filament of far - ir bright galaxies linking two of three massive clusters in close proximity at @xmath2  the rcs2319 + 00 supercluster @xcite .",

    "x - ray , strong lensing and virial mass estimates all imply individual cluster masses of @xmath0m@xmath1 .",
    "the close proximity of the three components , taken with the fact that the extended x - ray emission and density profiles of the red - sequence members appear to be aligned strongly suggests that the clusters are most likely in the early stages of a three - way merger that will result in a @xmath7m@xmath1 cluster by @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "all three spire maps show a region of apparent ` enhanced ' far - ir emission over the background  in the form of a complex of blended and confused point sources  spanning the ` a ' and ` b ' components of rcs2319 + 00 , but not extending into the core region of component ` a ' . for our analysis ,",

    "however , we note that no similar structure is seen between cluster cores b and c which are similarly aligned on the sky , and the filament does not appear to run directly between the a and b cores , but rather traces an easterly arc ( in both spectroscopy and spire emission ) , suggestive of a real and unique structure .",

    "herschel _ , we can simply sum the flux densities of the snr@xmath40 250@xmath3 m sources .",

    ", we plot a pixel flux histogram of the filament versus the background , showing a striking excess of far - ir emission in the filament at all flux levels ( see fig .",
    "[ hist ] ) .",
    "we now sum the 29 250@xmath3 m sources in the filament region and subtract a conservative area - normalized background estimate ( based on the flux density of snr@xmath24 sources outside of the filament region ) , yielding @xmath41mjy . due to the incompleteness in our source extraction",
    ", unsurprisingly we see only a @xmath42 hint of an overdensity in the filament ( n@xmath43arcmin@xmath36 ) versus the background ( n@xmath44arcmin@xmath36 ) .",
    "we now present a more quantitative analysis and interpretation of the level of star - formation enhancement in the far - ir filament using our collection of extensive follow - up spectroscopy in rcs2319 + 00 .",
    "m pixel flux histograms showing a striking excess of far - ir emission in the filament versus the background ( pixels outside the filament region).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      we can estimate the contribution of far - ir emission in the filament by summing the far - ir flux densities of individual ir - bright cluster members and then scaling an appropriate galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . to identify ir - bright cluster members we work directly with the mips 24@xmath3 m imaging which has a much smaller psf ( fwhm@xmath45 ) than the spire data and therefore allows for reliable cross - referencing with the spectroscopy .",
    "we then determine the appropriate far - ir sed shape by performing a standard stacking analysis ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) to derive the average three - band spire flux densities of the 24@xmath3m - detected cluster members in the filament , thus yielding the average sed from 24500@xmath3 m .",
    "the spire imaging is much shallower relative to the mips imaging , and is only sensitive to l@xmath46l@xmath1 activity at the cluster redshift  and indeed only three of the 24@xmath3 m cluster members appear to be ` detected ' at 250@xmath3 m ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we thus proceed to stack the flux densities from the spire maps at the location of the 14 mips cluster members ( which have an average 24@xmath3 m flux of @xmath47@xmath3jy ) , yielding significant stacked flux densities of @xmath48mjy ( 7.0@xmath25 ) , @xmath49mjy ( 6.2@xmath25 ) , and @xmath50mjy ( 4.6@xmath25 ) at 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath3 m , respectively .",
    "we note that stacking the cluster members on the spire maps using the much more precise mips positions should help to minimize any blending and confusion contamination from the spire emission of non - cluster members .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the stacked spire flux densities in relation to a set of spectral templates @xcite and the median _",
    "herschel_-astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( h - atlas ; @xcite ) galaxy template with @xmath51l@xmath52l@xmath53l@xmath54 from @xcite , redshifted to @xmath2 and normalized to the 250@xmath3 m stacked flux density .",
    "the far - ir colors are consistent with the ` cool ' templates from the @xcite library , with @xmath55 rest - frame colors .",
    "the h - atlas template is also a reasonable fit to the average far - ir emission , yielding l@xmath56l@xmath54 , which is consistent with the lirg - class . using the @xcite sfr conversion , sfr(m@xmath54yr@xmath6)@xmath57l@xmath58 ( which assumes a starburst age @xmath59100myr and a @xcite initial mass function ) , yields an average sfr of @xmath60m@xmath54yr@xmath6 .    at @xmath2 ,",
    "the mips 24@xmath3 m band is dominated by a complex of broad polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission . when assessing the total l@xmath61 , as defined by the 81000@xmath3 m integrated emission , normalizing template seds to 24@xmath3 m emission alone is subject to a high degree of uncertainty , due to the potential variation ( intrinsic and redshifted ) of the pah contribution in the 24@xmath3 m band .",
    "similarly , our lack of spectral coverage in the 30100@xmath3 m range means we have poor constraints on the contribution of a hot dust continuum component , which could boost the luminosity in the 24@xmath3 m band ( e.g. ,  fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is evidenced by the range of 24@xmath3 m fluxes predicted by the 250@xmath3 m normalized templates , which straddle the average 24@xmath3 m emission .",
    "therefore , we take the @xcite template as a conservative estimate of the form of the rcs2319 + 00 members seds , and use this to calculate the total l@xmath61 of the filament .",
    "since our spectroscopic follow - up of the mips cluster members is incomplete , we can only place a conservative lower limit to the total far - ir emission in the filament by summing the 250@xmath3 m emission contributed by the 14 24@xmath3m - detected cluster members , yielding @xmath62mjy . assuming each galaxy has the same sed shape",
    ", we use the h - atlas template to determine a total l@xmath63l@xmath1 , corresponding to a total sfr within the filament of @xmath64m@xmath1yr@xmath6 .",
    "we stress that these estimates are strictly lower limits due to the spectroscopic incompleteness of the galaxies in the vicinity of the filament and the requirement of a 24@xmath3 m detection . for example , if we include the 27 cluster members that were not detected at 24@xmath3 m in the stack , we find a factor of 40% more far - ir emission .",
    "rather than attempt to correct for spectroscopic completeness we now use a different approach to estimate the total ir emission .",
    "earlier we estimated the statistical total ir excess emission within the filament compared to the average over the map using only the spire data .",
    "this should provide a more complete picture of the level of star - formation activity in the filament as this estimate does not suffer from spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "the total ( background subtracted ) signal is @xmath65mjy within an area of 26.3arcmin@xmath35 , which corresponds to a total l@xmath66l@xmath1 and sfr within the filament of @xmath67m@xmath1yr@xmath6 .",
    "how can we interpret these observations ?",
    "first we note that star formation in the filament galaxies is unlikely to be impeded by ram - pressure stripping , given ( a ) the relatively low density of the intergalactic medium ( igm ; @xcite ) and relative galaxy velocities compared to the cores of the clusters ( ram - pressure scales with the icm density and the square of the galaxy velocity ; @xcite ) ; and ( b ) the relatively short duration for the star formation events ( 100smyr ) compared to the time required for stripping in these environments ( up to several gyr , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , conditions within intermediate density ( i.e. ,  filament ) environments might be suitable for tidally inducing activity via close interactions and mergers between gas - rich systems being accreted onto such environments .",
    "for example , @xcite find an enhancement in the local fraction of ( uv / ir selected ) star - forming galaxies in a similar filamentary environment surrounding the cl0016 + 16 supercluster at @xmath68 . is the star formation in the rcs2319 + 00 supercluster filament significantly enhanced compared to the field ?",
    "we have established that the total sfr occurring within the filament , as traced by the 250@xmath3 m emission , is significantly larger than the local background . on its own",
    ", however , this does not directly indicate triggered or enhanced star formation as this may simply reflect the underlying over - density of star - forming galaxies which have not been actively quenched . to quantify any possible enhancement we look at the sfr per unit stellar mass , m@xmath69 , or specific sfrs ( ssfrs ) of the mips cluster members in the filament .",
    "the stellar mass was derived directly from the measured irac-4.5@xmath3 m flux densities after applying an @xmath70 color correction to the m / l ratio , following @xcite .",
    "normalized to the same stellar mass , the individual ir galaxies within the filament have @xmath93@xmath34 the ssfr of ir - bright galaxies within the central cluster cores , but only @xmath71 that of galaxies in the rest of the supercluster . to avoid systematic differences we do not attempt to compare this to field galaxies at this epoch and",
    "simply note that the filament galaxies do not show enhanced emission compared to the rest of the supercluster",
    ".    how important would this star formation be to the overall growth of what will be a very massive cluster ? given the apparent low stellar mass of the individual galaxies within the filament , their eventual fate is to fall onto the faint - end of the red sequence .",
    "we have estimated the total stellar mass already in place in rcs2319 + 00a within 2.1mpc to be m@xmath72m@xmath1 .",
    "this estimate is obtained by fitting a schechter function to the background - subtracted 4.5@xmath3 m flux and integrating this to provide a total rest - frame @xmath73-band luminosity ( above m@xmath74 ) which is then converted to stellar mass assuming an early - type sed @xcite .",
    "using the m@xmath75 derived from the x - ray luminosity provides a stellar - to - total mass conversion which we then apply to the other two cluster cores , yielding a total m@xmath69(@xmath592.1mpc)@xmath76m@xmath1 .",
    "thus , if the filament galaxies continue at their current sfrs until the clusters finally merge at @xmath770.5 , they will increase the descendent cluster mass by 20% .",
    "this should be regarded as an upper - limit , as the star formation will begin to shut down at earlier times as the galaxies enter the increasingly dense cluster environment and as fuel is exhausted ; nevertheless the pre - processing witnessed in this filament appears to be an important stage of the build - up of the cluster stellar mass .",
