    "the unified model for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) postulates that type 1 and type 2 agns are intrinsically identical .",
    "the most popular explanation for their observed differences is due to different viewing orientations ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a geometrically thick dusty torus is supposed to surround the agn central engine .",
    "when an observer views the central region near the polar axis of the torus , a broad emission line region ( blr ) can be observed directly , identifying these galaxies as type 1 agns . on the other hand , at angles near the equatorial plane of the torus , the central region of the agn , with its blr , can not be observed .",
    "the narrow emission line region ( nlr ) , the size of which is at least an order of magnitude larger than the torus , is always observed regardless of torus orientation .",
    "thus , these galaxies are classified as type 2 agns .    the key parameters of dust torus unification - the intrinsic geometry ( e.g. , thickness and covering factor ) and physical properties - are still unknown .",
    "to investigate these parameters , infrared ( ir ) observations of agns are important , because the reprocessed radiation from the dust in the torus is re - emitted in the ir wavelength range . in this study , we focus on the geometrical covering fraction of the dust torus .",
    "the covering factor ( cf ) is defined as the fraction of the sky , as seen from the agn center , which is blocked by obscuring material .",
    "this corresponds to the fraction of type 2 agns out of the entire agn population .",
    "many previous studies have attempted to estimate cf .",
    "for instance , @xcite estimated cf for 26 luminous quasars .",
    "they fitted the @xmath22 - 35 @xmath0 spectra from the spitzer space telescope @xcite irs using three - component models made of a clumpy torus , dusty nlr clouds , and very hot dust clouds .",
    "the clumpy torus model attempts to fix problems with torus unification . in this more complicated model , the observed differences between type 1 and type 2 agns are due not only to orientation , but also to random probability ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the observer s line - of - sight passing through the torus may , with some probability , pass through a gap in the clouds .",
    "such an object is classified as a type 1 agn , even though it is viewed at a high inclination angle , similar to other type 2 agns .",
    "conversely , even when viewed from a near - polar angle , there is some small probability that a dust cloud may happen to obscure the agn along the particular sightline .",
    "such an object is classified as type 2 agn .",
    "this complex model in general lacks the simplicity and predictive power of the original dusty torus .",
    "those authors found a mean cf value of 0.27 by fitting the agn data , which may be anti - correlated with bolometric luminosity .",
    "@xcite also calculated the cf of 13 nearby seyfert galaxies by using clumpy torus models with a bayesian approach to fit their ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and ground - based high - angular - resolution mid - ir spectroscopy .",
    "they found a tendency for the cf to be lower ( @xmath20.1 - 0.3 ) at high agn luminosities than at low agn luminosities ( @xmath20.9 - 1 ) , which supports the result of @xcite .",
    "however , these studies were limited to small numbers of individual objects , rather than a statistically complete agn sample . to overcome this problem , we estimate the cf of dust torus using the ir luminosity function ( lf ) . the lf of galaxies is a fundamental statistical tool for describing galaxy properties , since it should be almost entirely independent of the viewing angle . in this study",
    ", we construct the lf using the akari satellite .",
    "akari , the first japanese space satellite dedicated to infrared astronomy , was launched in 2006 @xcite .",
    "one of its most important results was an all - sky survey in the mid - ir ( mir ) and far - ir ( fir ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial resolution and sensitivity of akari are much better than those of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras : @xcite , @xcite ) which performed a previous all - sky ir survey .",
    "in particular , the detection limits ( 5@xmath6 ) for point sources per scan are 50 and 90 mjy for the 9 and 18 @xmath0 bands , respectively , with spatial resolutions of about , thus surpassing the iras survey in its 12 and 25 @xmath0 bands by an order of magnitude in both sensitivity and spatial resolution .    in this study",
    ", we report the 9 and 18 @xmath0 lfs of galaxies at 0.006 @xmath7 0.8 using the akari mir all - sky survey catalog .",
    "the sample selection is described in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the 9 and 18 @xmath0 lfs with the 1/@xmath8 technique and compare our results with previous studies . in section 4 , we discuss the number density ratio of type 1 agns and type 2 agns as estimated from the lfs of agns and compare it to previous optical and x - ray estimates .",
    "this study provides us with an important estimate of the dust torus structure of agns . throughout this study",
    ", we assume a flat universe with @xmath9 , and we adopt ( @xmath10 , @xmath11)=(0.3 , 0.7 ) and @xmath12=75 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure_1.eps    the akari mir all - sky survey catalog provides the positions and fluxes of 870,973 sources ( including 844,649 sources in the 9 @xmath0 band and 194,551 sources in the 18 @xmath0 band ) .",
    "the sample used for this study was selected from akari mir sources with spectroscopy from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 @xcite and the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) redshift survey ( zcat : @xcite ) .",
    "the flow chart used for sample selection is shown in figure [ sample - selection - algorithm ] .",
    "first , our sample was narrowed to the 29,418 akari sources in the sdss spectroscopic region . to ensure flux accuracy , we then extracted objects that met the following criteria :    * flux ( 9 @xmath0 ) @xmath14 90 mjy ( for 9 @xmath0 lf ) * flux ( 18 @xmath0 ) @xmath14 170 mjy ( for 18 @xmath0 lf )    these fluxes correspond to the 50% completeness flux limits calculated by @xcite .",
    "next the 25,139 remaining objects ( 24,936 sources with 9 @xmath0 flux greater than 90 mjy and 4,316 sources with 18 @xmath0 flux greater than 170 mjy ) were cross - matched with the tycho-2 catalog ( hg  2000 ) to remove the galactic bright stars .",
    "this catalog contains the positions , proper motions , and two - color photometry for the 2.5 million bright stars in the sky down to the magnitude limit of the plates ( @xmath15 ) . to avoid the omission of high proper - motion stars",

    ", rigorously propagated to the epoch j2000.0 , by the proper motions in this catalog . as a result ,",
    "a total of 23,336 ( @xmath292.8% of the objects cross - identified with the tycho-2 catalog ) stars ( hereinafter akari - tycho 2 objects ) were extracted . as shown in figure [ cross - match_ned_sdss ] , we adopted 3 arcsec as our search radius , because the star density in the sdss spectroscopic region is at most @xmath250 deg@xmath13 ( hg  2000 ) .",
    "thus , by adopting this search radius , the probability of chance coincidence is less than 0.01% ( i.e. , 25,139 @xmath16 0.0001 @xmath2 3 sources may be misidentified ) , which is acceptable .",
    "we then identified 1,803 akari sources in the sdss spectroscopic catalog and in the zcat .",
    "both have the redshifts of @xmath2900,000 objects cataloged .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic catalog mainly contains magnitude - limited objects with @xcite magnitude brighter than @xmath17 = 17.77 for galaxy samples @xcite and with point - spread function ( psf ) magnitude brighter than @xmath18 = 19.1 for quasar samples at @xmath19 2.3 @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using the sdss is that we obtain uniform spectroscopic data .",
    "the average redshift of these spectroscopic objects is @xmath20.1 .",
    "however , bright objects that might be saturated are excluded in the spectroscopic target selection ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , for bright galaxies , we use the zcat , which is compiled from literature , and has a limiting magnitude of @xmath215.5 in the b band .",
    "the search radii for the sdss and zcat were 6 and 12 arcsec , respectively , as shown in figure [ cross - match_ned_sdss ] .",
    "for the sdss , the surface density of galaxies in the sdss spectroscopic region is 92 deg@xmath20 @xcite . within 6",
    "arcsec around each akari mir source , the expected number of galaxies is then 0.008 . adopting this search radius means that the probability of chance coincidence is less than 0.1% ( i.e. , 1,803 @xmath16 0.001 @xmath2 2 sources may be misidentified ) , which is acceptable . for the zcat ,",
    "the surface density of galaxies in the sdss spectroscopic region is @xmath271 deg@xmath20 .",
    "thus , by adopting a search radius of 12 arcsec , the probability of chance coincidence is less than 0.25% for the akari - zcat sources ( i.e. , 1,489 @xmath16 0.0025 @xmath2 4 sources may be misidentified ) .",
    "this value is relatively larger than the corresponding value of the sdss , but is acceptable , because the zcat assembles the nearby or spatially extended galaxies . at this point , 472 galaxies remained for selection .",
    "furthermore , we excluded 124 local galaxies with @xmath19 0.006 from the sample .",
    "the errors in distance measurement are dominated by peculiar motions for galaxies with @xmath19 0.006 , and thus , the luminosity also has a large error .",

    "the details of the 348 galaxies selected are given in table [ sample_list ] .",
    "ultimately , 243 and 255 galaxies were selected for construction of the 9 @xmath0 lf and the 18 @xmath0 lf , respectively . throughout this process",
    ", we mainly used the akari catalog archive server @xcite and a software kit called `` 2mass catalog server kit '' to easily construct a high - performance database server for the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog ( which includes 470,992,970 objects ) and several all - sky catalogs @xcite .",
    ".list of 348 galaxies . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,^,^ \" , ]     first , we compare our result with that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite selected 3,000 agns using the sdss redshift range of 0 @xmath7 0.15 and presented the emission line lfs for type 1s and type 2s . in this study , we focus on the luminosity of the [ oiii ] line as a tracer of agn activity .",
    "[ oiii ] can be excited by not only an agn but also by massive stars in star - forming galaxies . however",
    ", such galaxies can not contaminate the agn samples , because the bpt line ratio classification will exclude star - forming galaxies from our agn sample because of their [ nii]/h@xmath3 ratios .",
    "the type 2/type 1 ratio obtained from the [ oiii ] lf in @xcite is @xmath20.67 , which is smaller than our result ( see table [ comp_phi ] ) .",
    "this difference may indicate that hao et al . systematically underestimated the intrinsic [ oiii ] luminosities of type 2s .",
    "this situation may be occurred when the [ oiii ] emission from nlr of type 2s are partially blocked by the dust torus .",
    "however , above explanation would contradict the basic premise of simple unification that is expected the intrinsic differences do not exist between type 1 and type 2 agns .",
    "next , we compared our result with rush , malkan , & spinoglio ( 1993 ) and @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in section [ result ] , rush , malkan , & spinoglio ( 1993 ) constructed 12 @xmath0 lfs for type 1 and type 2s using the iras fsc . @xcite also constructed agn samples in the local universe ( @xmath19 0.1 ) using data from the swift - bat telescope and calculated the x - ray ( 15 - 55 kev ) lfs of absorbed and unabsorbed agns , which were classified according to their absorbing column density ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the results obtained from the 12 @xmath0 and hard x - ray lfs are @xmath21.75 and @xmath21.63 , respectively , as shown in table [ comp_phi ] , which is in good agreement with our results .",
    "this indicates that there are a large number of narrow - line agns in the local universe .",
    "this is also consistent with previous conclusions from x - ray observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that the classification by x - ray ( unabsorbed and absorbed agns ) does not necessarily correspond to optical classifications ( type 1 and type 2s ) .",
    "some absorbed agn samples in @xcite tended to be classified as type 1s by optical observations .",
    "this tendency indicates that the number density ratio @xmath22 obtained from x - ray classification would be slightly larger than that from optical classification , which is further consistent with our estimate .",
    "figure [ n_ratio ] shows the fraction of type 2 agns as a function of 18 @xmath0 luminosity . it is a decreasing function .",
    "note that the redshift range of the type 2s plotted in figure [ n_ratio ] is limited to 0.006 @xmath7 0.2 , because the sdss spectroscopic catalog may not be as complete for type 2s at @xmath23 0.2 compared with type 1s .",
    "before interpreting this result , we should consider the effect of ( i ) our classification of type 2 , ( ii ) unknown types of galaxies , ( iii ) our `` rejected '' galaxies , and ( iv ) the detection limit of the h@xmath3 line for the sdss spectroscopic survey .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure_15.eps      in this study , we basically only considered seyfert 2 galaxies to be type 2s .",
    "however , most of the liners seem to also follow the distribution of type 2s .",
    "moreover , some of the composites can harbor low - luminosity type 2s .",
    "hence , we examined the effect these populations might have if they were included in the fraction of type 2s .",
    "for this , we made four possible groups of type 2s .",
    "1 .   seyfert 2 galaxies ( sy2s ) 2 .",
    "sy2s + liners 3 .   sy2s + composites 4 .",
    "sy2s + liners + composites    figure [ n_ratio ] also shows the fraction of the type 2s when liners and/or composites were added to the type 2 category as described above .",
    "as shown in this figure , the fraction of type 2s decreases with 18 @xmath0 luminosity regardless of the changes in the type 2 classification criteria .      as we described in section [ classification ] ,",
    "11 galaxies were classified as unknown types of galaxies for the 18 @xmath0 sample .",
    "the redshift range of these galaxies is less than 0.2 . among the 11 galaxies ,",
    "6 were obtained from the sdss , and 5 were obtained from the zcat .",
    "we found that none of these sdss galaxies were type 1s ( see section [ classification ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we could not constrain the 5 zcat galaxies , because the zcat does not include spectroscopic line information . therefore , we considered the effect of these objects by including two extreme possibilities as follows :    * 6 sdss galaxies and 5 zcat galaxies are type 2s . * 6 sdss galaxies are type 2s and 5 zcat galaxies are type 1s .",
    "figure [ n_ratio ] also shows the fractions of type 2s considering both of these cases .",

    "] , we selected 243 and 255 galaxies at 9 and 18 @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "however , it should be noted that when we cross - matched the akari - zcat objects , 1,331 akari sources did not match within 12 arcsec ; thus , we rejected these objects for this study",
    ". if these objects were galaxies , our results would be affected . for an estimate of their effect , these 1,331 objects ( hereinafter akari - non - tycho 2 objects ) were cross - matched with the 2mass point source catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) to investigate their color distributions .",
    "we adopted 3 arcsec as our search radius , which was optimized for cross - identification between these two catalogs @xcite .",

    ", we carefully determined their type using the previous literature .",
    "finally , 276 objects were confirmed as stars or planetary nebulae , thus , 294 - 276 = 18 objects remained as galaxies ( 13 objects for 9 @xmath0 and 7 objects for 18 @xmath0 ) . the maximum uncertainty caused by including them as galaxies would be 13/243 @xmath20.053 ( 5.3% ) for the 9 @xmath0 sample and 7/255 @xmath20.027 ( 2.7% ) for the 18 @xmath0 sample , respectively .",
    "finally , we consider the sdss detection limit for the detection of the broad h@xmath3 line from the type 1s in the lowest luminosity bin . if the detection limit was not sufficiently low to detect some type 1s , the fraction of type 2s could be overestimated , especially in the lowest luminosity bin in figure [ n_ratio ] . to investigate this , we estimated the detection limit of the h@xmath3 line , considering the typical luminosity ratio between h@xmath3 and 18 @xmath0 of type 1s",

    "next , we investigated all agns in the sdss dr7 spectroscopic region .",
    "according to the fwhm of h@xmath3 and the bpt diagram , 26,568 agns were then extracted .",
    "furthermore , we extracted 652 agns with a redshift between 0.006 and 0.03focusing on the lowest luminosity bin ( @xmath28 ) in figure [ n_ratio ] , which corresponds to @xmath29 0.03 ( see figure [ l ] ) .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure_19.eps    figure [ lha ] shows the distribution of @xmath30 for the 652 agns .",
    "as shown in figure [ lha ] , these histograms go down to the faintest bin of @xmath30 @xmath31 , which is consistent with the histogram of @xmath30 obtained by @xcite .",
    "this limit corresponds to @xmath32 for our 18 @xmath0 agns , assuming the typical luminosity ratio .",
    "therefore , the detection limit seems sufficiently low to detect the broad h@xmath3 lines from the type 1s in the lowest luminosity bin ( @xmath28 ) even if we adopted the maximum value ( @xmath2 4 ) of @xmath33 distribution as the typical luminosity ratio .",
    "the decreasing fraction of type 2s at increasing luminosity could mean that the luminosity from the central engine influences the structure of the torus .",
    "the covering factor of the dust torus is smaller for more luminous agns , possibly because increasing luminosity sublimates more dust , causing the inner radius of the dust torus to recede @xcite .",
    "this result has been reported several times in the past .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the mir spectra of 25 agns taken with irs on board the spitzer space telescope showed a negative correlation between @xmath34 and the [ oiii]@xmath355007 line luminosity .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are the continuum luminosity at the rest - frame wavelength of 6.7 @xmath0 and 5100 @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "they mentioned that one possible explanation was that higher [ oiii ] luminosities imply a more luminous central engine and larger dust sublimation radius , suggesting that a larger dust sublimation radius would give a lower covering factor of dust if the obscuring medium is distributed in a disk with constant height .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a negative correlation between the fraction of absorbed agn and hard x - ray luminosity using a swift - bat sample .",
    "our study confirms and extends these results with akari , by taking our larger mir sample .",
    "we emphasize that a luminosity - dependent torus geometry destroys the simplicity of the original torus unification scheme , and now requires that at least one new free function must be determined .",
    "the torus covering fraction as a function of agn luminosity can be measured from complete mir observations , with our figure [ n_ratio ] as a first effort to do so .",
    "using the akari mir all - sky survey , we constructed the 9 and 18 @xmath0 lfs for all types of local galaxies . using nearly complete optical spectroscopy of emission lines",
    ", we made a classification based on the width of h@xmath3 or the emission line ratios of [ oiii]/h@xmath4 and [ nii]/h@xmath3 .",
    "we classified the akari sources into five types ( type 1 agns , type 2 agns , liners , composites , and sfs ) .",
    "we then calculated the number density of type 1 agns and type 2 agns by integrating each lf .",
    "the main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "akari s efficiency at identifying agns is excellent , with 41% of our 18 @xmath0 sources hosting active nuclei .",
    "the number density ratio of type 2 to type 1 agns obtained from the 18 @xmath0 lf is 1.73 @xmath5 0.36 . that value is larger than the results obtained from the optical ( [ oiii ] ) lf @xcite .",
    "the cause of this difference is probably the absorption of the [ oiii ] photons by the dust torus in type 2 agns in particular . on the other hand ,",
    "the results obtained from the mir ( 12 @xmath0 ) and hard x - ray ( 15 - 55 kev ) lfs are consistent with each other .",
    "the fraction of type 2s among all agns decreases with increasing 18 @xmath0 luminosity .",
    "thus , the covering factor of the dust torus probably depends on the 18 @xmath0 luminosity .",
    "our mir results are also comparable to those reported using optical and x - ray observations .",
    "these results suggest that most of the agns in the local universe are obscured , but the obscuration ( whether by a torus or another mechanism ) decreases with mir luminosity .",
    "furthermore , these obscured agn are well - measured using mir surveys , just as they are by complementary hard x - ray surveys .",
    "recently , the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) all - sky survey data was released .",

    "<S> we present the 9 and 18 @xmath0 luminosity functions ( lfs ) of galaxies at 0.006 @xmath1 z @xmath1 0.8 ( with an average redshift of @xmath2 0.04 ) using the akari mid - infrared all - sky survey catalog . </S>",
    "<S> we selected 243 galaxies at 9 @xmath0 and 255 galaxies at 18 @xmath0 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectroscopy region . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies were then classified by their optical emission lines , such as the line width of h@xmath3 or by their emission line ratios of [ oiii]/h@xmath4 and [ nii]/h@xmath3 into five types : type 1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( type 1 ) ; type 2 agn ( type 2 ) ; low - ionization narrow emission line galaxies ( liner ) ; galaxies with both star formation and narrow - line agn activity ( composite galaxies ) ; and star - forming galaxies ( sf ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that ( i ) the number density ratio of type 2 to type 1 agns is 1.73 @xmath5 0.36 , which is larger than a result obtained from the optical lf and ( ii ) this ratio decreases with increasing 18 @xmath0 luminosity . </S>"
