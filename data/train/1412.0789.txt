    "due to the developments of astronomical and cosmological observations in recent years , it was revealed that our universe is filled by a nonbaryonic and highly nonrelativistic ( cold ) matter component called dark matter .",
    "the nature of dark matter can not be explained in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , which strongly suggests that new physics exists beyond the sm .",
    "so far , the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) motivated by supersymmetry ( susy ) are regarded as leading candidates of the dark matter .",
    "however , this wimp scenario becomes less plausible after the recent results of the large hadron collider that no evidence of susy has been observed yet [ e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ] . in this context , the axion , which is an alternative possibility to explain dark matter , is now getting more attention .",
    "the axion  @xcite appears as a ( pseudo ) nambu - goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry , which is introduced as a solution of the strong cp problem of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite . in order to compensate the cp - violating term in the qcd lagrangian",
    ", the axion field @xmath4 has a following coupling with the gluon field , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gauge coupling constant , @xmath7 is the gluon field strength , and @xmath8 is its dual .",
    "@xmath9 is so called the axion decay constant , whose value must be much higher than the electroweak scale in order to avoid experimental constraints  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the axions are produced in the early universe due to the misalignment mechanism  @xcite , and that they behave like the nonrelativistic matter .",
    "the physics of the axion is closely related with the early history of the universe . in particular , the cosmological scenario becomes different according to whether the pq symmetry is broken after inflation or not .",
    "if the pq symmetry is restored during inflation , the isocurvature perturbations induced by the quantum fluctuations of the axion field during inflation affect the observational results of the cosmic microwave background , putting a stringent constraint on the axion models if the inflationary scale is sufficiently high  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the pq symmetry is broken after inflation , topological defects such as strings and domain walls are formed , and we must take account of their evolution in the early universe .",
    "the interesting consequence of the axion models is that the formation of hybrid networks of topological defects , where strings are attached by domain walls , occurs at the epoch of the qcd phase transition if the pq symmetry is broken after inflation .",
    "let us call such configurations the string - wall systems .",
    "the evolution of these string - wall systems becomes different depending on the value of an integer number @xmath10 called the  domain wall number \" .",
    "it is known that they are short - lived if @xmath1 , and long - lived if @xmath3 .    in the scenario described above",
    ", it is expected that an additional number of axions are produced because of the decay of strings and domain walls , and that the estimation of the axion abundance is different from the usual one predicted by the misalignment mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this possibility was investigated extensively by several groups , but there were some controversies about the significance of the contribution from strings and domain walls ( see descriptions in the subsequent sections ) .",
    "recently , these controversies have been addressed by developing field - theoretic simulations of topological defects in the expanding universe . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the evolution of global strings was investigated with 3d simulations in a box of @xmath11 grids , and the spectrum of axions produced from them was estimated .",

    "@xcite the formation and the decay of the string - wall systems for the models with @xmath1 were investigated with 3d simulations in a box of @xmath11 grids , and the spectrum of axions radiated from them was estimated .",
    "the similar analysis was performed for the models with @xmath3 in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a result of the series of studies ,",
    "it becomes clear that the contributions from strings and domain walls can be larger than the misalignment component , and that the constraints on the model parameters become more severe than before .",
    "the computational methods established in the previous studies enable us to estimate the total abundance of the axion dark matter including the contributions from topological defects .",
    "then , it is important to ask for the accuracy of these theoretical estimations , since their results might have a relevance to various experimental researches on dark matter axions . in light of this fact ,",
    "here we aim to update the previous results and to clarify the sources of uncertainty on the determination of the axion abundance in the scenario where the pq symmetry is broken after inflation .",
    "the main improvement achieved in this paper is that the decay time of string - wall systems in the models with @xmath3 is estimated in detail by the use of 2d simulations with grid sizes @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . due to the large box sizes of the present simulations , it becomes possible to investigate the decay of string - wall systems in the cases with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which were not studied in the previous work  @xcite because of the limitation of dynamical ranges . by performing additional 3d simulations in a box of @xmath11 grids",
    ", we also discuss the uncertainties contained in the estimated mean energy of radiated axions , which were not addressed in refs .",
    "furthermore , for the sake of completeness , we reevaluate the contributions from the misalignment mechanism and strings in addition to those form string - wall systems .",

    "in this section , we review the cosmological aspects of axions and describe production mechanisms of them . if we assume that the pq symmetry is broken after inflation , we must take account of three production mechanisms : misalignment mechanism , decay of global strings , and decay of string - wall systems .",
    "the energy density of relic axions can be estimated as a sum of these three contributions .      in the invisible axion models , we introduce a complex scalar field @xmath22 ,",
    "which is a singlet under the sm @xmath23 gauge group and charged under the global @xmath24 symmetry .",
    "let us call this scalar field pq field .",
    "the pq symmetry is spontaneously broken when the pq field acquires a vacuum expectation value @xmath25 at some high energy scale .",
    "after that , the axion field @xmath26 can be identified as a phase direction of the pq field [ i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "this axion field acquires a periodic potential due to the nonperturbative effect of qcd when the temperature of the universe becomes less than @xmath28gev . at that time",
    ", the classical axion field is probably displaced from the minimum of its potential , and this vacuum misalignment causes the coherent oscillation of the axion field  @xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative effect of qcd with finite temperature was discussed by several authors  @xcite to model the temperature dependence of the axion mass @xmath29 . among them , in ref .",
    "@xcite the axion mass was studied based on the interacting instanton liquid model ( iilm )  @xcite , which gives a concrete framework to treat the qcd effect for all temperatures , in contrast to the earlier results  @xcite based on the high temperature dilute gas approximation . in this paper",

    "varies from @xmath49 to @xmath50 for fixed values of @xmath51 and @xmath33 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath44 changes from @xmath52 to @xmath53 as the temperature decreases from @xmath54 to @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "this ambiguity leads to a minor correction to the result for the relic axion abundance , at most by a factor @xmath56 [ see , e.g. , eq .  ] . ]",
    "note that eq .",
    "is valid only if the condition [ eq .  ] is satisfied before @xmath29 reaches the zero temperature value [ eq .  ] .",
    "this requirement is always satisfied for the range of the axion decay constant @xmath48 considered in this paper .",
    "let us estimate the energy density of axions produced by the misalignment mechanism .",
    "assuming that the potential for the axion field is dominated by the quadratic term of the form @xmath57 , we can write the energy density of these axions at the initial time @xmath36 as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the initial misalignment angle .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath60 is conserved over time once the adiabatic condition @xmath61 is satisfied  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the energy density at the present time @xmath62 can be estimated as @xmath63 the dilution factor can be computed in terms of the entropy conservation : @xmath64 , with @xmath65 being the entropy density at the present time .",
    "so far we have assumed that the potential of the axion field is quadratic and that the quantity @xmath60 is exactly conserved just after the time @xmath36 .",
    "strictly speaking , these two conditions are inaccurate , and the deviations from these approximations lead to some correction factors  @xcite .",
    "first , the anharmonic effect becomes important for large values of @xmath59 .",
    "we can model this effect by replacing a factor @xmath66 in eq .   with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a function that approaches 1 for @xmath69 but takes a value greater than 1 for @xmath70 .",
    "second , the deviation from the adiabatic approximation at the initial stage of the coherent oscillation leads to lager energy density than the naive estimation performed in eq .  .",
    "this effect was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and it was shown that the correction factor @xmath67 should be multiplied by a factor of @xmath71 . taking account of these correction factors ,",
    "we estimate the fraction between the energy density of coherently oscillating axions and the critical density of the universe today @xmath72 as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the parameter for the hubble constant ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "if the pq symmetry is broken after inflation , we expect that the value of @xmath59 varies randomly over the horizon scale @xmath76 at the qcd phase transition .",

    "this process can be modeled by the dynamics of the complex scalar field @xmath22 with the following potential @xmath86 spontaneous breaking of the global @xmath24 symmetry induced by this potential leads to the formation of line - like objects called global strings .",
    "these strings continuously produce axions , which can contribute to the cold dark matter abundance  @xcite .",
