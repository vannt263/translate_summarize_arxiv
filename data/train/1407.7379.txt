    "in this article , we consider a semi - discrete model for the evolution of a driven interface subject to line tension in a random , heterogeneous , quenched environment .",
    "we prove that if the driving force is large enough then such an interface propagates with a positive velocity  even if the random environment contains obstacles of arbitrarily large strength .",
    "let @xmath1 be a probability space and consider the following lattice differential equation for the height @xmath2 of the @xmath3 dimensional interface in an ambient space of dimension @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath10 .",
    "the operator @xmath11 denotes the discrete @xmath0-dimensional laplacian operator , namely @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the discrete 1-norm .",
    "the one - dimensional setting was discussed in  @xcite , in this note we generalize our results to arbitrary dimension , albeit only for the ( semi-)discrete evolution .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 , @xmath15 are independent and identically distributed functions such that the map @xmath16 is measurable with respect to the product of the borel-@xmath17 algebra on @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the map @xmath20 is locally lipschitz for almost all @xmath8 . furthermore , we assume that @xmath21 .    disregarding infinitely fast growing unphysical solutions",
    ", these assumptions guarantee that equation   above admits a unique solution with non - negative velocity for every @xmath22 and that the solution depends measurably on @xmath23 for each @xmath24 .",
    "the solution furthermore admits a comparison principle .",
    "the main further assumption on the @xmath25 is that they admit a finite exponential moment .",
    "as opposed to some other requirements , like independence , this assumption is central to our proof . under these conditions",
    ", we can prove our main result .",
    "[ thm : main ] assume in addition to the above requirements that there exists @xmath26 such that @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes taking the integer ceiling of the argument .",
    "then there exists a non - decreasing function @xmath29 which is not identically zero and which depends on @xmath30 and @xmath31 only , such that for all @xmath32 we have @xmath33 and therefore @xmath34 specifically , we can choose @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes taking the integer floor of the argument .",
    "the proof is split in two parts , first a discrete result arguing that there can be no discretized interface whose average velocity is small .",
    "the second part is an application of this result to the coupled systems of odes .",
    "taking @xmath37 large for small values of @xmath38 , one can see that @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath38 becomes large , one can take @xmath37 closer to @xmath30 to see that there exists a constant @xmath41 , depending only on @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath0 , such that @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "the main theorem also implies the following almost sure result for the point - wise velocity , excluding the existence of stationary solutions .",
    "[ thm : limsup ] under the conditions of theorem  [ thm : main ] we also have @xmath44 along any deterministic sequence of times @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",
    "a model very similar to the one considered here was recently discussed in  @xcite .",
    "as opposed to our model , they use a fully discrete evolution , where in each time - step the system advances by one unit at every point where the total force is positive .",
    "while some of their results are comparable to ours , they use a rigorous renormalization group approach to prove that in their model ( assuming also uniformly bounded obstacles ) , an interface is either completely blocked ( in the sense that a non - negative stationary solution exists ) or that it propagates ballistically , i.e. , there is no intermediate regime of sub - ballistic propagation . in more general models , like the one here",
    ", this question remains open .",
    "in particular , for the present model , we can only prove that there exist two critical values for the driving force : if the driving force is below the first value , the interface becomes stuck for all times .",
    "if , on the other hand , the driving force is above the second value the interface propagates with finite velocity . the first result is a simple adaptation of our methods in  @xcite and the second part is proved here .",
    "generally , problems of the present form ( whether fully discrete , partially discrete , or fully continuous ) have received considerable interest in the physics community ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "many connections to questions arising from physics are discussed in the aforementioned article by bodineau and teixeira  @xcite , as well as in  @xcite , where the first rigorous result on non - existence of stationary states was derived .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : discrete ] , we show non - existence of states whose velocity is too small . in the following section  [ sec : cont ] , we apply this result to prove our theorem .",
    "we finish with some conclusions and an outlook in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section , we prove the central lemma stating that in a fully discrete version of our model , one can with probability one not find any function whose average velocity is too small .",
    "let thus now @xmath47 defined for all @xmath48 .",
    "for convenience , we begin by introducing some notation .",
    "we use the following abbreviations .",
    "* @xmath49 , the @xmath0-dimensional cube of sites in @xmath50 of side - length @xmath51 , * @xmath52 , the @xmath17-algebra generated by the random functions in @xmath53 , * @xmath54 , any fixed number , later to be taken as the integer ceiling of an _ a priori _ bound on the maximal value the functions @xmath55 , solutions of   can take at time @xmath56 , * @xmath57 , the set of admissible functions , * @xmath58 , the set of admissible functions within a cube @xmath59 , * @xmath60 , the size of the boundary layer around @xmath53 , * @xmath61 , the number of ways @xmath62 can be represented as the sum of @xmath63 ( ordered ) non - negative integers .",
    "[ lem : discrete ] for each @xmath64 , there exists a set @xmath65 of full measure such that for any @xmath66 and any function @xmath67 we have @xmath68 and @xmath31 and @xmath30 are defined in theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "fix @xmath69 and consider for @xmath70 the sequence of random variables @xmath71 the basic underlying idea in this definition is the following .",
    "we will show , using a martingale argument , that for sufficiently large @xmath38 the sequence @xmath72 almost surely vanishes exponentially in the size of the box @xmath53 .",
    "for this decrease we can also establish a rate .",
    "such a decrease , however , implies that as we look at larger and larger boxes around the origin , either the sum of the normal derivatives at the boundary of the box ( the first term in the exponential ) has to become large and negative quickly , or the sum of the velocities ( the second term in the exponential ) in @xmath53 has to increase with a rate related to the one with which @xmath72 vanishes .",
    "the first option is excluded by the non - negativity of @xmath73 .",
    "the second option yields the average velocity ( with a negative sign ) , after taking a logarithm and using the sum over all paths as an estimate for the supremum over all possible paths .",
    "the first step in the proof is to relate the change in normal derivatives as @xmath74 increases to the addition of terms in the sum over the laplcian .",
    "we use a discrete version of the divergence theorem , namely that @xmath75 and thus @xmath76 a calculation now yields @xmath77 where the sum in the second line is taken over all admissible extensions of @xmath73 to functions in @xmath78 .",
    "taking now @xmath79 with the sum as above over all possible extensions , we get @xmath80 in order to estimate @xmath81 further , we need to rearrange and count the number of possible extensions . in the sum over all admissible extensions",
    "we thus first take all extensions such that @xmath82 , calling these `` admissible extensions with velocity @xmath83 '' and then sum over all @xmath84 . in the case that there does not exist an admissible extension with velocity @xmath83 , we take the sum to be zero .",
    "this yields @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the of the number of admissible extensions with velocity @xmath83 , depending on the realization of the random field @xmath87 and on @xmath73 from the previous step .",
    "we also note that @xmath88 for @xmath89 is a fixed value inside the supremum , which allows us to use the assumption on the exponential moment of @xmath87 .",
    "the idea for estimating @xmath90 now is the following : given @xmath83 , there are no more than @xmath91 possibilities to distribute these velocities on the @xmath92 sites . with all velocities fixed , for most sites in @xmath93 where the extension lives ,",
    "the function value is determined due to the fact that @xmath23 and the velocity can be used to calculate the discrete laplacian ( if such a choice exists at all ) .",
    "the number of sites where we still have freedom is @xmath94 .",
    "we thus aim for an estimate of the type @xmath95 .",
    "first notice that in dimension @xmath96 , there is no freedom to choose any additional values for the extension if the laplacian at the boundaries is given .",
    "consider thus the case @xmath97 .",
    "each given function value and the laplacian on the site can be used to write one independent linear equation for the function values on the extension , therefore the remaining number of sites with freedom is @xmath98 .",
    "see the illustration in figure  [ fig : extension ] for the two - dimensional case .",
    "note that the number of choices for each of those nodes is limited to at most @xmath99 , and that @xmath100 .",
    "since the above estimate was independent of @xmath101 and on @xmath102 , this yields @xmath103    using the estimate @xmath104 , the sum can be bounded as follows .",
    "we have @xmath105 which , using @xmath106 yields @xmath107 we thus have @xmath108 for some constant @xmath41 .",
    "equation   together with the boundedness of @xmath81 and the almost sure finiteness of @xmath109 establishes that @xmath110 for @xmath111 is a non - negative supermartingale . from doob",
    "s martingale convergence theorem we therefore find that @xmath112 on a set @xmath113 of full measure .",
    "note furthermore that @xmath114 and thus @xmath115 where we have used that @xmath116 and dropped all terms that are of lower order than @xmath117 .",
    "in particular , these are the terms in @xmath118 that are of lower order than @xmath119 as well as @xmath120 and the first sum inside the exponent in @xmath72 , which vanishes in the limit due to the boundedness of @xmath73 .",
    "this proves the lemma .",
    "the lemma from the above section allows us to complete the proof of the main theorem .",
    "assume that the statement in the theorem is untrue .",
    "then there exist @xmath121 and some @xmath122 such that @xmath123 . by our independence assumptions on the field @xmath87",
    ", the processes @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath15 are stationary and ergodic and take values in @xmath126 .",
    "we write @xmath55 instead of @xmath124 . by birkhoff",
    "s ergodic theorem , we have @xmath127 almost surely . however , taking @xmath88 to be @xmath55 rounded to the closest integer , we find @xmath128 by lemma  [ lem : discrete ] .",
    "the almost sure statement about the velocities can be derived by the following argument .",
    "consider , for a fixed sequence of times @xmath45 , the random variables @xmath129 noting that @xmath130 is stationary , ergodic and bounded from above and below by @xmath38 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath132 , by fatou s lemma . by the non - negativity of the velocity and @xmath25",
    ", it follows that @xmath133 for all @xmath134 and almost all @xmath23 , and therefore @xmath135 for almost all @xmath23 .",
    "now let @xmath136 . by stationarity",
    ", @xmath137 is constant in @xmath22 and we write @xmath138 . by the discrete divergence theorem , boundedness of @xmath130 and ergodicity of @xmath139 imply that @xmath140 and since @xmath135 for almost all @xmath23 we have @xmath141 almost surely and for all @xmath15 .",
    "this yields that @xmath142 is a bounded , ergodic , and stationary process whose realizations are almost surely harmonic .",
    "thus , @xmath142 is almost surely constant in @xmath22 and therefore @xmath143 is almost surely equal to its expected value .",
    "the desired result follows .",
    "in this note , we have extended our depinning result from  @xcite to the case of arbitrary dimension in a semi - discrete model of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "a careful inspection of the proof shows that one can furthermore extend our results to obstacle strengths coupled over a finite distance : if there exists @xmath144 such that sets of obstacles are independent if their distance ( in the first @xmath0-dimensions ) is above @xmath145 , one can still obtain similar estimates for the velocity .",
    "the case of the fully continuous model on @xmath146 , however , remains open .",
    "further unresolved issues are whether we have @xmath147 almost surely for sufficiently large @xmath38 , the relaxation of the result to obstacles with fat tails , as well as whether a regime of sub - ballistic propagation ( i.e. , vanishing velocity , but propagation of the interface to @xmath148 everywhere ) can exist in our models . as mentioned above , for a specific fully discrete evolution model this last question was answered recently  @xcite ."
