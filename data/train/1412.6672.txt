    "low - temperature crystal solids are full of wonderful and surprising phenomena , that are of both fundamental and practical importance but often difficult to observe owing to the imperfect nature and inflexibility of solid state systems .",

    "it is experimental developments like this , along with the ability to create cold atom lattices that meet virtually any need , that has motivated tremendous activity in the past decade in using cold atom lattice models as an excellent platform for exploring and mimicking complicated condensed matter phenomena @xcite .",
    "a subject of profound importance in condensed matter physics is superconductivity , a coherent phenomenon arising from condensation of correlated electron pairs , also known as bardeen - cooper - schriffer ( bcs ) pairs , on a macroscopic scale .  a bcs pair , however , is not energetically favored unless there exists an attraction between its constituents , which appears impossible in an electron system where coulomb repulsion dominates .",
    "the effort to solve this mystery led , through the insights of fllich , to the phonons of ionic crystal lattice oscillations and the eventual understanding that the interaction they induce between electrons is the source of the attraction responsible for superconductivity in most materials @xcite .    in cold atom physics , an analogous situation can arise from a bose - fermi mixture , where phonons can exist as low energy excitations of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , describing the density fluctuation of the bec @xcite . the same phonons in the bose gas can then induce an attractive interaction between fermions in the fermi gas @xcite .",
    "this , along with the unprecedented ability to tune parameters in such systems , e.g. , two - body interaction and dimensionality , allows for the possibility of clean and controllable realization ( or quantum simulation ) of superfluid pairings in cold atom bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "remarkable experimental progress has been made in creating quantum - degenerate bose - fermi mixtures , e.g. , @xmath5li-@xmath6li @xcite , @xmath7na-@xmath6li @xcite , @xmath8rb-@xmath9k @xcite , @xmath6li-@xmath8rb @xcite , and @xmath7na-@xmath9k @xcite .",

    "the study of unconventional pairing states , where the gap parameters possess symmetries different from the usual s - wave symmetry , began with the work by anderson and moral @xcite  and that by balian and werthamer @xcite , which led to the discovery of a- and b - phase with @xmath2-wave symmetries in superfluid @xmath17he @xcite .",

    "the same induced - interaction was proposed by  kohn and luttinger @xcite as a pairing mechanism ( kohn - luttinger mechanism ) for realizing superfluids with high - partial wave symmetries in fermi gases with bare repulsive interactions . as such",
    ", this induced interaction plays an important role in the exploration of pairing physics in pure fermi gases . in a bose - fermi mixture , however , not only background fermions but also phonons of the bec can mediate an interaction between fermions .",
    "the former interaction can be ignored in situations where it is much weaker than the latter interaction @xcite , which will be our case here .",
    "additionally , we may ignore the fermion interaction since the kohn - luttinger effect in 2d systems with rotational invariance is exponentially suppressed compared with its 3d counterpart @xcite , and our model takes place in the setting of a 2d lattice . at any rate ,",
    "our results in this paper , like those in many others ( see , for example , @xcite ) which also ignore the kohn - luttinger mechanism , hold in the parameter space where the phonon - induced interaction dominates .",
    "at temperatures below the fermi temperature , fermions tend to form  the normal ground state ( fermi sea ) , in which states below the fermi energy are all occupied with each state accommodating one particle .  as in crystal solids , the phonon - mediated interaction in our model , being attractive , may serve as a catalyst , causing the normal state to undergo dynamical instability towards the bcs state , in which fermions are divided into highly correlated pairs with opposite momenta .",
    "this normal - to - superfluid phase - transition is accompanied with a lowering of symmetry and is therefore of second - order in nature .",

    "this suppression is strong enough that , as shown by the dotted lines in [ fig : tc - nf](b ) , all phases in the second category are strongly suppressed in the same region where the @xmath2-wave pairing exceeds the @xmath1-wave pairing displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc - nf](a ) .",

    "in particular , fig [ fig : tc - nf](d ) demonstrates that the @xmath2-wave pairing with a critical temperature in the order of a hundredth of @xmath169 is possible .",
    "the conclusion is that in contrast to the @xmath1-wave pairing , which may dominate close to half filling , the @xmath2-wave may dominate away from half filling in a window centered roughly around @xmath283 ,  while all the other unconventional pairings , in spite of the possibility of being substantially enhanced by the use of the dipolar interaction , are unable to emerge as dominant phases .",
    "we have considered a cold atom mixture in a square optical lattice where the mixture is made up of a two - component fermi gas and a single - component dipolar bose gas in the state of a homogeneous bec .  by eliminating the phonons of the dipolar bec , we have constructed an effective lattice fermi system which preserves the symmetry of point group @xmath0 .",
    "focusing on this effective model , we have explored , within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - field theory , the competition among density waves and superfluids with both conventional and unconventional parings .",

    "( [ 3d s ] ) for  fermions in a square lattice that interact via both a contact and a long - range interaction .",
    "the long - range interaction here is in the form of an attractive ( lattice - version ) yukawa potential , which occurs ubiquitously across a broad spectrum of physics , e.g. , nuclear physics and condensed matter physics .",

    "the various techniques we developed in this work may then offer a good starting point for future studies to build toolboxes for simplifying gap equations associated with such interactions .    as eq .",
    "( [ 3d s ] ) , our 1d integral equations enjoy the advantage of allowing many features of the critical temperatures to be determined in a semi - analytical manner .",
    "in particular , we have applied them to analyze the critical temperatures of various competing orders as functions of the healing length and filling factor in both the absence and presence of the dipolar interaction .",
    "we have found that tuning dipolar interaction @xmath229 on the negative side lowers the phonon energy and can significantly enhance the unconventional pairings .",
    "we have found that close to half filling , the @xmath1-wave pairing with a critical temperature in the order of a fraction of @xmath169 may dominate all the other phases , and at a higher filling factor , the @xmath2-wave pairing with a critical temperature in the order of a hundredth of @xmath169 may emerge as a winner .",
    "our theory also includes the pairings with @xmath3- and @xmath4- wave symmetries . in spite of dramatic enhancements of their critical temperatures",
    ", we have found that tuning a dipolar interaction will not be able to make the pairings with @xmath3- and @xmath4- wave symmetries to dominate the other phases .",
    "it is to be stressed that the phase diagram based on the critical temperature analysis does not correspond necessarily to what is realizable at zero temperature .",
    "the actual ground state may exist as a superfluid with a pure symmetry or a coherent superposition of those with pure symmetries .",
    "[ the latter dominates the phase diagram when the dipolar interaction is tuned away from the diagonal line ( but stays within the square ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : regionofdipolarbec ] where the system breaks d4 symmetry . ]  to construct the phase diagram at zero temperature requires the computational machinery of energy minimization , which can be a time - consuming task for a dipolar bose - fermi mixture where the parameter space is unusually large .",
    "the 1d integrals developed in this paper allow us to gain not only quick insights into various critical temperatures but also , very importantly , a sense for the role each parameter plays in this large parameter space .",
    "thus , these integrals , just as with their 3d continuous analog in eq .",
