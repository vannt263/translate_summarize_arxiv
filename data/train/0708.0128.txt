    "the non drifted case @xmath15 has been studied in @xcite .",
    "here we assume @xmath16 and show ( see theorem [ napoleone ] ) that the statistics of @xmath0slopes is well described by a stationary alternating marked simple point process on @xmath17 whose points are the points of @xmath0extrema of the brownian motion , and each point @xmath5 is marked by the @xmath0slope going from @xmath5 to the subsequent point of @xmath0extremum .",
    "we will show that the @xmath0slopes are independent and specify the laws @xmath18 , @xmath19 of upward @xmath0slopes and downward @xmath0slopes non covering the origin , respectively .",

    "khinchin theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our proof is based both on fluctuation theory for lvy processes , and on the theory of marked simple point processes .",
    "the part of fluctuation theory follows strictly the scheme of @xcite and can be generalized to spectrally one  sided lvy processes , i.e. real valued random processes with stationary independent increments and with no positive jumps or with no negative jumps @xcite[chapter vii ] . in fact , some of the identities of lemma [ davide ] and proposition [ calcoli ] below have already been obtained with more sophisticated methods for general spectrally one  sided lvy processes ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand , the description of the @xmath0slopes as a stationary alternating marked simple point process allows to use the very powerful palm  khinchin theory , which extends renewal theory and leads to a complete description of the @xmath0slope covering the origin .",
    "this analysis can be easily extended to more general lvy processes , as the ones treated in @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section [ rengroup ] , our results concerning the statistics of @xmath0extrema of drifted brownian motion correspond to the ones obtained in @xcite via a non rigorous real space renormalization group method applied to sinai random walk with a vanishing bias .",

    "we analyze the behavior of the drifted brownian motion around its @xmath0extrema .",
    "while in the non  drifted case a generic @xmath0slope non covering the origin behaves in proximity of its extremes as a 3dimensional bessel process , in the drifted case it behaves as a process with a cothangent drift , satisfying the sde @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an independent standard brownian motion and the sign in the r.h.s .",
    "depends on the kind of @xmath0slope ( downward or upward ) and on the kind of @xmath0extrema ( @xmath0minimum or @xmath0maximum ) .",
    "in addition , we show that the process ( [ silurino ] ) is simply the brownian motion on @xmath22 , starting at the origin , with drift @xmath23 , doob  conditioned to hit @xmath24 before @xmath25 .",
    "the interest in the statistics of @xmath0slopes and their behavior near to the extremes comes also from the fact that , considering the diffusion in a drifted brownian potential , the piecewise linear path obtained by connecting the @xmath0extrema of the brownian potential is the effective potential for the diffusion at large times @xcite .",
    "given @xmath26 we denote by @xmath27 the law on @xmath28 of the standard two  sided brownian motion @xmath1 with drift @xmath2 having value @xmath5 at time zero , i.e. @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the two  sided brownian motion s.t . @xmath31 has expectation zero and variance @xmath32 .",
