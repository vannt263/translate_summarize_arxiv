    "the ktev experiment  @xcite has measured a large @xmath5-violating , @xmath6-odd asymmetry in the decay @xmath14 , in quantitative agreement with a prediction made some years ago  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this effect lies in the amplitude of the radiative decay @xmath15 , which contains a bremsstrahlung term proportional to @xmath16 , as well as a @xmath5-conserving direct emission term of magnetic dipole character  @xcite .",
    "the interference of the odd electric multipoles @xmath17 present in the bremsstrahlung amplitude , which all have @xmath18,with the magnetic @xmath19 multipole of @xmath20 , produces @xmath5-violating components in the polarization state ( stokes vector ) of the photon  @xcite .",

    "this is entirely consistent with the fact that the amplitude @xmath27 is accurately reproduced by bremsstrahlung alone , so that no electric - magnetic interference is expected .",
    "an interesting question raised by the above observations is the following : how does the asymmetry @xmath28 evolve with time if the neutral @xmath1 meson is prepared in an initial state @xmath10 or @xmath11 of definite strangeness ?",
    "how does the value of @xmath28 evolve from zero at short times ( when the state decays like @xmath12 ) to the value @xmath29 at large times ( when the state is essentially @xmath13 ) ? finally , what type of evolution is expected in the decay of an incoherent @xmath30 mixture , such as an untagged neutral kaon beam originating in the decay @xmath31 ?",
