    "i treat the ism as if it were simply an impediment to knowledge , and suggest ways that one might estimate its effects .",
    "this topic has taken on increasing importance in recent years as more and more experiments are requiring correction for the `` galactic foreground '' ( e.g. , hauser 2001 ) . here",
    "the emphasis will be on the use of the 21 cm line to determine a total @xmath0 , for the 21 cm line is our most general tool , and @xmath0 is an important quantity which can be used to estimate @xmath2 , e(b  v ) and @xmath3 , as well as the likelihood that there is molecular hydrogen along the line of sight .",
    "some of the points treated here are discussed in more detail in reviews by kulkarni & heiles ( 1987 ) , dickey & lockman ( 1990 ; hereafter dl90 ) , dickey ( 2002 ) , and lockman ( 2002 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the amount of neutral interstellar gas , expressed as an equivalent hi column density , needed to produce unity opacity given normal abundances . below the c - band edge at 0.25",
    "kev the opacity results almost entirely from photoelectric absorption by hydrogen and helium , which contribute about equally to @xmath4 ( balucinska - church & mccammon , 1992 ) .",
    "surveys of the sky in the 21 cm line find @xmath5 @xmath6 where b is the galactic latitude ( dl90 ) .",
    "thus , _ most _ sight - lines through the milky way have @xmath7 for @xmath8 ev , even without taking into account any contribution to the opacity from molecular hydrogen , @xmath1",
    ". luckily , there are large areas of the sky over which @xmath0 is a factor of several below the average , but even so , the lowest @xmath0 in _ any _ known direction is @xmath9 @xmath6 ( lockman , jahoda & mccammon 1986 ; jahoda , lockman & mccammon 1990 ) , so observations at @xmath10 ev must always involve substantial corrections for the galactic ism .    except in directions where it is possible to make a direct measurement of @xmath0 in uv absorption lines , every attempt to determine the effect of the ism on extragalactic observations should begin with the 21 cm line .",
    "the leiden - dwingeloo ( ld ) 21 cm survey covering @xmath11 at @xmath12 angular resolution ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) supersedes all previous general surveys because of its angular and velocity resolution , and high quality of data",

    "some parts of the sky of special interest have been mapped at higher angular resolution ( e.g. , elvis et al .",

    "; barnes & nulsen 2003 ) .",
    "the brighter emission near the galactic plane is now being measured at @xmath13 resolution by a consortium who employ three different synthesis arrays ( knee 2002 ; mcclure - griffiths 2002 ; taylor et al .",
    "radio telescopes measure an hi brightness temperature , @xmath14 , as a function of velocity , but in general , there is no single formula that can be applied to derive @xmath0 from the observed @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath19 is the excitation temperature of the transition , which is often , but not always , equal to the gas kinetic temperature ( e.g. , liszt 2001 ) .",
    "but the real interstellar medium is not uniform , and the typical 21 cm profile consists of several blended components formed in regions of different temperature . if the line is optically thin at all velocities there is no dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath6 .",
    "the optically thin assumption always gives a lower limit on @xmath0 .    in directions where part of the line has",
    "@xmath21 the concept of a meaningful @xmath19 becomes ambiguous and there is no unique solution for @xmath0 from 21 cm emission data alone ( e.g. , kalberla et al .",

    ". an hi cloud at 100 k with @xmath22 km s@xmath18 has @xmath23 for @xmath24 @xmath6 , so the 21 cm line in an average direction ( see fig .",
    "2 ) should be treated as if it has components which are not optically thin .",
    "theory tells us that under some conditions hi can exist in two stable phases at a single pressure : a warm phase whose temperature is thousands of kelvins , and a cool phase whose temperature is @xmath25 k ( e.g. , field , goldsmith , & habing 1969 ; wolfire et al .",
    "observations suggest that reality is not so bimodal ( e.g. , liszt 1983 ) , but the generalization is still useful  the ism does contain cool hi with a high 21 cm line opacity and warm hi with a low opacity ( e.g. , heiles & troland 2003 ) . in the solar neighborhood there is more mass in the warm hi than the cold ( liszt , 1983 ; dickey & brinks , 1993 ) .",
    "the cold phase fills a much smaller volume than the warm phase and has a smaller scale - height as well , so at high galactic latitudes many sight lines skirt the clouds and intersect predominantly `` intercloud '' medium , which has a low opacity because of its high temperature and turbulence . in these directions",

    "the situation has been further confused by the reported discovery of an anomalous population of tiny , dense hi clouds , whose significance , not to say reality , is now known to have been exaggerated . twain s warning against thoughtless extrapolation is especially appropriate to this topic .",

    "cold hi may have more structure than warm hi , and molecular clouds even more , but as a practical matter , the extrapolation to small angles introduces large errors only when a significant part of the gas in a particular direction is molecular or of anomalous origin , e.g. , comes from a high - velocity cloud .",
    "examination of 21 cm spectra around the position of interest should give adequate warning of possible structure which then would require higher resolution observations to measure .",
    "a lack of appreciation for the effects of power - law turbulence at small angles was one reason why the early , high - resolution , vlbi studies were interpreted as evidence for an anomalous population of extremely dense hi clouds with sizes of tens of au .",

    "the issue of small - scale structure in the ism is interesting , and there are anomalous directions , e.g. , toward 3c 138 , where clumping in cold gas appears to be significant ( faison 2002 ) , though here the total @xmath0 is @xmath40 @xmath6 and not a typical extragalactic sight - line . recently barnes & nulsen ( 2003 ) combined interferometric and single - dish data to measure 21 cm emission toward three high - latitude clusters of galaxies and found limits on fluctuations in @xmath0 on scales of @xmath13@xmath41 of @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",

    "this gas is almost certainly optically thin in the 21 cm line .",
    "the low - velocity gas further shows evidence of two components , one warm and one cool .",

    "the intermediate velocity gas over this field has a smaller dependence on angle , with a factor @xmath64 change in @xmath0 and most structure to the south and east .    in a direction ( like the cdfn ) where much of the hydrogen is in a high - velocity cloud ,",

    "the particular high - velocity cloud that crosses the cdfn has an abundance of metals only about @xmath67 that of solar ( richter et al .",
    "the intermediate velocity hi component also probably has different properties than disk gas at some wavelengths because of its different dynamical history .",
    "thus , unlike most directions on the sky , where the kinematics of galactic hi is irrelevant to its effects on extragalactic observations , the direction of the cdfn may be an exception , and require a specific hi component analysis .",
    "in contrast to the cdfn , preliminary gbt observations of the chandra deep field south show that it has a hi spectrum dominated by a single , weak , low - velocity line . quite boring",
    "compared to the cdfn .",
    "the 21 cm line can be a powerful tool for estimating the influence of the galactic ism on extragalactic observations , but it must be used with some thought , and it does not give the complete picture .",
    "unresolved angular structure in the 21 cm data is unlikely to dominate the error budget in most directions . for @xmath68 @xmath6",
    "it is probable that there is some molecular hydrogen along the sight line and the total @xmath69 will be difficult to determine .",
    "but in my opinion , it is the poorly - understood ionized component of the ism which introduces the most serious uncertainties for directions with little molecular gas , and it affects observations in all directions .",
    "we are entering an era when highly accurate 21 cm data will be available over the entire sky , and then , ( though likely even now ) the limits on understanding the influence of the ism on extragalactic observations will lie not in the uncertainties in @xmath0 , but in @xmath51 and @xmath2 , and in the relationship between the dust and the gas .",
