    "the long - term goal of this work is to justify the existence and investigate , via computer - aided experiments and suitable mathematical arguments , a prototypical fractal billiard , namely , the koch snowflake billiard .    since the koch snowflake curve ( the boundary of the koch snowflake billiard table , see fig .",
    "[ fig : kochconstruction ] ) is nowhere differentiable , it is certainly not clear from the outset that the koch snowflake billiard  or , let alone , the associated billiard flow  is a legitimate mathematical object of study .",
    "indeed , the first question that springs to mind is `` _ _ how do you reflect a billiard ball off of a nondifferentiable boundary _ _ ? '' on the other hand , because the koch curve is highly symmetric ( indeed , it is _ self - similar _ ) and can be thought of as some kind of ` infinite polygon ' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kochconstruction ] ) , it may not be entirely unreasonable to harbor such an expectation .    in this paper",
    ", we provide experimental and geometric evidence towards this claim , as well as formulate conjectures and open problems concerning this challenging problem . in a nutshell , the koch snowflake billiard is viewed as a suitable limit of ( rational ) polygonal billiard approximations ; and analogously for the associated billiard ( and geodesic ) flows .",
    "we also identify a variety of ( potential ) periodic and quasiperiodic orbits of the koch snowflake fractal billiard , and discuss some of their properties .    in order to present our experimental results and conjectures about the snowflake billiard",
    ", we need to briefly recall several concepts from the theory of dynamical systems ( more specifically , of rational polygonal billiards ) and fractal geometry .    a _ polygonal billiard _ @xmath5 is given by a polygon @xmath6 and the bounded region enclosed by @xmath6 . for example , the square billiard is given by the square and the region bounded by the square . when studying a polygonal billiard ,",
    "one is primarily concerned with the orbits of a pointmass moving at unit speed in @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that our billiard ball experiences no friction and perfectly elastic collisions with the smooth portions of the boundary . upon colliding with a smooth portion of the boundary ,",
    "we reflect at the boundary according to snell s law , which says that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , chapter 9 of @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "in general , if the billiard ball collides with a corner of the polygonal billiard table @xmath5 , we must terminate the trajectory because we can not determine reflection at such points .",
    "we call the map that describes the flow on the billiard @xmath6 the _ billiard map_. an important case of a polygonal billiard is a _ rational billiard _ and is defined to be a polygon @xmath6 for which every interior angle is a rational multiple of @xmath7 ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "although a fractal is a shape that lacks many of the appealing qualities of polygons , so long as we are dealing with the right fractal , it is a shape that can be generated by polygons , a fact that is heavily exploited in this paper . the type of fractals we are interested in are self - similar fractal curves in @xmath8 that are nowhere differentiable and have infinite length . specifically , the fractal billiard that we eventually want to define and investigate is the koch snowflake billiard , denoted by @xmath0 ; the boundary of the associated billiard table is the koch snowflake curve , denoted by @xmath1 . the construction of the koch snowflake fractal curve is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : kochconstruction ] .",
    "the _ prefractal _",
    "@xmath2 of @xmath0 is then an @xmath9th level polygonal approximation of @xmath0 .",
    "like many fractals , the koch snowflake curve @xmath1 has a non - integer dimension . in the case of the snowflake ,",
    "that dimension is @xmath10 , which indicates that the curve @xmath1 has infinite length .",
    "( with sides of length 1 ) ; from left to right : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the process continues ad infinitum , yielding the koch snowflake curve , viewed here as the boundary of the koch snowflake billiard table @xmath0 . for each integer @xmath4",
    ", @xmath2 denotes the @xmath9th prefractal polygonal approximation to @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath2 defines a rational billiard because its interior angles are either @xmath15 or @xmath16 . while this property is not required to be a rational billiard , the interior angles of @xmath2 alternate between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "( depending on the context , @xmath2 also sometimes refers to the polygonal boundary of this rational billiard ; the latter boundary is more correctly denoted by @xmath17 , however . ) ]    the koch snowflake is not a rational polygon .",
    "the boundary of the koch snowflake ` fractal billiard ' is nondifferentiable , hence making it very difficult to properly define , and let alone analyze , the billiard map .",
    "however , the behavior of a pointmass may be anything but random , because , as was alluded to just above , @xmath0 has the very special property that there is a sequence of finite polygonal approximations @xmath18 converging to @xmath0 such that for each finite @xmath9 , @xmath2 is a rational billiard ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : kochconstruction ] . in order to overcome the limitations of the koch snowflake",
    ", we may examine the prefractal billiard approximations @xmath2 and attempt to make an argument in support of the existence of periodic orbits of the limiting fractal billiard @xmath0 , based on results concerning the rational polygonal billiards @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , in some sense , the snowflake curve is viewed as an ( infinite ) ` fractal rational polygon ' and the associated billiard table @xmath0 as a ` fractal rational billiard ' .    roughly speaking , a compact set @xmath19",
    "is said to be _ self - similar _ if it can be written as a finite union of scaled ( or rather , similar ) copies of itself .",
    "more specifically , this means that @xmath20 is a nonempty compact subset of @xmath8 and there exists a finite collection @xmath21 of contractive similarity transformations of @xmath8 , with @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 .",
    "it then follows that for any nonempty compact subset @xmath24 of @xmath8 , we have that @xmath25 ( in the sense of the hausdorff metric ) , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes the @xmath28th iterate of @xmath29 ; see , e.g. , chapter 9 of @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the self - similar set @xmath20 is called the attractor of the iterated function system @xmath21 .",

    "we can exploit the fact that the proposed billiard @xmath0 has a self - similar boundary .",
    "we notice that , in a sense , @xmath2 is constructed from equilateral triangles .",
    "the billiard ball dynamics on the equilateral triangle billiard @xmath30 are well understood .",
    "in particular , the periodic orbits of the equilateral triangle billiard @xmath31 are classified in @xcite .",
    "the resulting theorem , combined with the fact that @xmath2 can be embedded in a tiling @xmath32 of the plane by equilateral triangles with side lengths @xmath33 , will aid us in explaining our experimental results and formulating some of our conjectures .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the necessary theory of rational billiards so that we may better present our results on the prefractal polygonal billiards @xmath2 ; see fig .",

    "we recall in  [ subsec : surface ] that the flow on the rational billiard @xmath6 corresponds to the geodesic flow on the corresponding surface @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , as is explained in  [ subsec : singularities ] , vertices constitute singularities of the billiard map and certain copies of the vertices in @xmath34 constitute singularities of the flow on the surface .",
    "we discuss what implications this has for the billiard ball dynamics .",
    "in  [ subsec : ksnratbilliard ] , we view the prefractal polygonal billiard @xmath2 as a rational billiard , and discuss the consequences of this fact for the billiard flow at the vertices of @xmath2 .",
    "we also construct the corresponding surface for @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 and indicate the singularities of each surface .",
    "we show that , in agreement with the general theory of rational billiards , reflection at acute angles can be defined , but that reflection at obtuse angles can not be determined unambiguously .",
    "in the last part of section 2 , namely  [ subsec : baum ] , we discuss the results of @xcite on the equilateral triangle billiard and their implications for the billiard @xmath2 . in doing so ,",
    "we explain how @xmath2 can be embedded in a tiling @xmath32 of the plane by equilateral triangles with side lengths @xmath33 ( as was alluded to above ) and give an equivalence relation on the collection of all periodic orbits of the rational billiard @xmath31 .",
    "we do not seek to generalize the results of @xcite to @xmath2 but instead use these results to provide us with a list of appropriately adjusted initial conditions for testing in @xmath2 .    in section 3 ,",
    "we present and discuss our experimental results on the prefractal billiard @xmath2 by raising and sometimes answering a variety of research questions . in general , we examine the behavior of what we call _ induced _ orbits of @xmath2 .",
    "an induced orbit is one for which the initial condition was appropriately adapted from an initial condition in the equilateral triangle billiard @xmath31 .    in  [ subsec : gammanorbits ] , we examine the behavior of periodic orbits of @xmath2 in the collection @xmath35 of billiard paths determined by the initial conditions @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a midpoint of a side of @xmath2 and @xmath15 is the initial angle of the periodic orbit at the starting point @xmath37 .",
    "we attempt to organize the orbits in @xmath35 according to their geometrical or dynamical behavior , and provide definitions for what we call _ fagnano orbits _ , _ piecewise fagnano orbits _ and _ primary piecewise fagnano orbits _ of @xmath2 .",
    "while these are very interesting orbits , the elements in @xmath35 do not constitute all of the induced orbits of @xmath2 .",
    "in  [ subsec : nongammanorbits ] , we examine the behavior of periodic orbits induced by the initial condition @xmath38 , where @xmath39 or @xmath40 and the orbit remains nonsingular , meaning that it does not hit any vertices of the billiard table .",
    "a particularly interesting example of such a periodic orbit is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a suitable value ( or vector ) used to perturb the initial basepoint lying at the midpoint @xmath37 of a side of @xmath2 .",
    "because of the nature of the equilateral triangle billiard , the reflection at the vertices of @xmath43 can be determined .",
    "consequently , in  [ subsec : singularorbits ] , these singular ( and periodic ) orbits are then used to induce singular orbits of @xmath2 , for some @xmath4 .",
    "finally , in  [ subsec : quasiperiodic ] , we close section 3 by discussing a seemingly uninteresting type of orbit , which we call a _ quasiperiodic orbit _ of @xmath2 . such an orbit can be considered as a ` rational approximation ' to a given periodic orbit .",
    "for example , if @xmath38 is an initial condition of a periodic orbit , then a corresponding quasiperiodic orbit would have an initial condition @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a rational approximation of @xmath46 ( obtained via a continued fraction expansion of @xmath46 ) .",
    "because the boundary of the billiard @xmath2 is changing as @xmath9 increases , the study of quasiperiodic orbits of @xmath2 should enable us to define a suitable notion of ` quasiperiodic orbit ' of @xmath0 .",
    "in section 4 , we conclude our paper by stating several conjectures based on our experimental results and provide a list of open problems and conjectures related to the proposed fractal billiard @xmath0 and a particular collection of its periodic orbits . in particular , we conjecture the existence of what we call the _ primary piecewise fagnano orbit _ of @xmath0 , which we propose would be a suitable limit of primary piecewise fagnano orbits of the prefractal approximations @xmath2 . in the special case of @xmath47 ,",
    "the ` primary piecewise fagnano ' orbit of @xmath0 , of @xmath0 is induced by the fagnano orbit of the original triangle @xmath43 ( i.e. , the shortest periodic orbit of @xmath31 ) , along with its appropriate counterpart in each billiard table @xmath2 ; see  [ subsec : gammanorbits ] , along with conjectures  [ conj : weakppf ] and [ conj : existenceofselfsimilarperiodicorbits ] of section 4 .",
    "] we also conjecture that its ` footprint ' consisting of all incidence points of the periodic orbit @xmath47 of @xmath0 . ] on the boundary @xmath1 is a self - similar subset of @xmath48 ; more specifically , it is the natural counterpart of the middle - third cantor set strung around the koch snowflake curve @xmath1 .",
    "the other conjectures and open problems stated in section 4 are clearly of a longer term nature .",
    "they concern , for example , the existence of the koch snowflake billiard @xmath0 ( as a proper mathematical object ) and of the associated billiard flow , and of the corresponding geodesic flow ( conjecturally equivalent to the billiard flow on @xmath0 ) ; see  [ subsec : surface ] and  [ subsec : ksnratbilliard ] , along with parts ( i ) and ( iii ) of conjecture [ conj : fractalbilliardfractalsurface ] .",
    "] or ( in the very long - term ) the relationship between the length spectrum of the elusive koch snowflake fractal billiard and the frequency spectrum of the corresponding koch snowflake drum ( e.g. , [ * la12*,*lanrg*,*lapa * ] , along with  12.3 and  12.5 of @xcite ) .. ]    in closing this introduction , we mention that the subject of billiards  and particularly , polygonal billiards or even , rational billiards  is an active area of research in the field of dynamical systems .",
    "books , survey articles and research papers on various aspects of this topic include , respectively , [ * kaha*,*ta * ] , [ * gastvo*,*gu*,*husc*,*mata*,*sm*,*vo*,*zo * ] and [ * baum*,*guju12*,*kaze*,*ma*,*ve13 * ] . to our knowledge , none of these references deals with the elusive case of ` fractal billiards ' .",
    "it is certainly true , however , that these works ( and the many relevant references therein ) have played a key role in motivating and guiding our investigations on the ` koch snowflake billiard ' ( and its rational polygonal approximations ) reported in the present paper .",
    "in this section , we want to discuss the properties of the billiard flow on @xmath2 and describe how @xmath2 can be viewed naturally as a _ rational billiard_.",
    "a _ rational polygon _ is a polygon with interior angles that are rational multiples of @xmath7 .",
    "if the boundary of a polygonal billiard is a rational polygon , then we call the associated billiard a _ rational billiard_. for us to discuss the flow on the associated closed surface , we need to define a few concepts .    if @xmath49 is a regular @xmath50-gon , where @xmath50 is a positive integer , then @xmath51 is the group of symmetries of @xmath49 and has cardinality @xmath52 .",
    "it is called the _ dihedral group _ and is generated by the reflections in the lines through the origin that meet at angles @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 be the group of planar motions generated by the reflections in the sides of a polygon @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath55 denote the subgroup of the orthogonal group @xmath56 consisting of the linear parts of the elements of @xmath54 .",
    "when the polygon @xmath6 has a connected boundary , then we can give an alternate characterization of it being rational .",
    "let @xmath6 be a polygon with connected boundary .",
    "then @xmath6 is a rational billiard if and only if the group @xmath55 is finite . in that case , if the interior angles of the rational polygon @xmath6 are written in the form @xmath57 for @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 are coprime positive integers and @xmath61 is the number of vertices of @xmath6 , then @xmath55 is isomorphic to the dihedral group @xmath51 , where @xmath50 is the least common multiple of @xmath62 .",
    "[ prop : altdefinitionofratpolygon ]    if @xmath6 is a rational billiard , then we have at our disposal a method for discerning periodic orbits .",
    "this method was first given in @xcite and reiterated in various forms in the literature ; see , e.g. , the survey articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath63 be the initial position of the billiard ball and @xmath46 be the initial direction of the billiard ball .",
    "let @xmath64 be the point on the side @xmath65 of the billiard table at which the billiard ball collides , and @xmath66 be the angle at which the billiard ball reflects off of @xmath65 .",
    "if the orbit @xmath67 is periodic , then we want to illustrate this by ` unfolding ' the billiard table and its contents .      to unfold the billiard table and its contents , reflect the contents of @xmath5 in the side @xmath65 .",
    "this results in a segment continuing in the direction of @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , we see that we have created a situation where the trajectory passes through @xmath65 and continues on to a segment that is collinear with the initial segment of the trajectory ( see fig . [",
    "fig : unfoldtheorbit ] for an example in the equilateral triangle billiard ) . continuing this process , we see that we can unfold a billiard table and its contents .",
    "when the orbit is a collection of line segments , such an unfolding will be a straight line .",
    "furthermore , the length of the unfolding is exactly the length of the orbit in @xmath5 .",
    "when the orbit unfolds and terminates on an edge of a polygon @xmath69 in the unfolding such that the terminal point is a copy of the initial point and the segment makes an angle with the side of @xmath69 equal to the initial angle , then the original orbit of @xmath6 is periodic .",
    "it is significant that we can unfold an orbit to determine the periodicity of the said orbit . in order to construct a closed surface out of the unfolding ( which is determined by the periodic orbit ) , we identify sides of the unfolding based on where the ball collides . in particular , we identify the terminal side with the initial side since the orientation of @xmath69 and the original polygon @xmath6 are the same .",
    "this results in a closed surface whose geodesic flow corresponds to the billiard flow on @xmath6 .",
    "we can see this clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : unfoldtheorbit ] . however , this closed surface depends on the initial position and angle .",
    "we want to construct a surface @xmath70 that is independent of these initial conditions .",
    "in addition , the geodesic flow on that surface @xmath34 will turn out to be equivalent to the original billiard flow on @xmath6 .",
    "consider the product @xmath71 .",
    "essentially , @xmath71 contains @xmath52 copies of our rational billiard table @xmath6 .",
    "a graphical representation of @xmath71 can be given by the following .",
    "if we fixed a vertex of a polygon @xmath6 such that reflection in the adjacent sides of @xmath6 generates @xmath52 copies of @xmath6 , then the resulting shape is what is called a _",
    "generalized polygon_. if two sides of the generalized polygon are translates of each other and/or the result of a rotation by @xmath7 , then we consider these two sides to be equivalent .",
    "then , upon modding out by this equivalence relation , we obtain a closed surface @xmath72 that does not depend on any particular orbit .",
    "consider the triangular billiard @xmath6 with boundary given by the triangle with interior angles @xmath73 .",
    "we reflect @xmath6 in the sides emanating from the vertex with angle @xmath74 .",
    "then , as is expected , we get a surface with 16 copies of the billiard @xmath6 ; indeed , @xmath75 and so @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the associated generalized polygon is an octagon .",
    "two sides are equivalent if they are translates of each other . modding out by this equivalence relation",
    ", we have obtained the associated flat surface @xmath34 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : octagonsurface ] .",

    "the surface @xmath34 is often referred to as a ` translation surface ' or a ` flat surface ' in the literature ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed , the geodesic flow on @xmath34 is nothing but the straight - line flow in the associated generalized polygon , with pairs of opposite sides identified as indicated above .",
    "the key fact concerning the geodesic flow on @xmath34 is that it is ( dynamically ) equivalent to the billiard flow on @xmath6 .      as mentioned before , the billiard map is only well defined at certain types of vertices of the rational polygonal billiard .",
    "we demonstrate under which conditions the billiard flow can be defined at vertices .",
    "if @xmath6 is a polygon , then the corresponding surface contains copies of the vertices of @xmath6 .",
    "these copies of the vertices are then considered singularities of the flow on the surface and are called _",
    "conic singularities_.    in order to understand what a conic singularity is , we must first introduce the notion of a conic angle .",
    "conic angle _ is an angle that measures the radians required to form a closed loop about the origin . in the plane , the conic angle is @xmath82 .",
    "we can form spaces in which the conic angle is not @xmath82 .",
