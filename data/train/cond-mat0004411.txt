    "electronic , superconducting and magnetic properties of the fast growing family of copper oxides and oxychlorides have attracted much attention last years .",
    "the undoped parent materials in the cuprate family are insulators showing a variety of low - dimensional magnetic properties .",
    "this variety extends from the quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) behavior @xcite with possible admixture of a weak ferromagnetism @xcite in the planar compounds to quasi-1d magnetic properties , observable in the chain - like @xcite and spin - ladder @xcite systems .",
    "the superexchange theory @xcite provides the necessary basis which allows to derive and to estimate the main interactions , including anisotropic ones , responsible for the magnetic coupling of the copper spins .",
    "the form , and especially the magnitude of several interaction constants of the resulting spin hamiltonian , however , strongly depend on pecularities of the cu - o - cu bond configuration in different cuprates ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "one interesting class of magnetic cuprates contains competing magnetic subsystems , like for instance tetragonal ba@xmath1cu@xmath0o@xmath2cl@xmath1 built up of cu@xmath0o@xmath2 planes with two types of copper sites ( cui , cuii ) .",
    "@xcite it is well known that in ba@xmath1cu@xmath0o@xmath2cl@xmath1 ( as well as in sr@xmath1cu@xmath0o@xmath2cl@xmath1 ) the moments of the cui and cuii atoms order antiferromagnetically at different temperatures @xmath4 @xmath5 330 @xmath6 380 k and @xmath7 @xmath5 30 @xmath6 40 k , respectively.@xcite below @xmath4 a small spontaneous magnetization , m@xmath8 , within the basal plane of the tetragonal lattice has been reported .",
    "the corresponding magnetic structure has been analysed in refs .   .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop the superexchange theory for the orthorhombic compound ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 ( space group pmma ) with a cu - o - cu bond geometry rather unusual in the cuprate family , but having also two crystallographically different types of cu sites .",
    "@xcite actually , in this compound the edge - sharing cuo@xmath2 plaquettes are not aligned in the same plane , but form folded chains . the chain axis is parallel to the orthorhombic @xmath9axis . the unit cell with two sorts , a and b , of crystallographically non - equivalent cu sites is depicted in fig .  [ cell ] . due to the typical cu@xmath10 ( 3@xmath11 )",
    "states the compound is an insulator .",
    "it was found to behave like a classical antiferromagnet with a nel temperature @xmath12 of about 20  k. @xcite below @xmath12 and for applied magnetic fields h@xmath13 parallel to the @xmath9axis this compound shows a spin - flop transition at @xmath14h@xmath13 @xmath5 2.6 t .",
    "@xcite thus , the easy axis of the antiferromagnetically ordered moments turns out to be the @xmath9axis .",
    "above @xmath12 the susceptibility follows a normal curie - like behavior . from the curie constant an effective paramagnetic moment of about 2 @xmath15",
    "is derived , which is typical for cu@xmath10 in the 3@xmath11 state .",
    "no weak ferromagnetism has been observed .",
    "@xcite preliminary group theoretical analysis showed @xcite that in ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 weak ferromagnetism is forbidden while weak antiferromagnetism can not be excluded .",
    "this symmetry analysis is extended below in close relation with the microscopical consideration based on the superexchange theory which yields dzyaloshinskii - moriya @xcite type interactions .",
    "the organisation of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "the results of the bandstructure calculation in the local density approximation ( lda ) for ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 will be briefly presented .",
    "the basic set of copper and oxygen orbitals responsible for superexchange processes will be fixed together with the estimates for the corresponding electronic transfer integrals and the orbital crystal field splitting parameters . at the next step , to provide a background for the superexchange theory the underlying multiorbital hubbard model is formulated with spin - orbit coupling on copper ions involved .",
    "the perturbation expansion of the multi - orbital hubbard model is used in section iii to derive an effective spin hamiltonian for the nearest - neighbour cu - cu magnetic interactions .",
    "a mean - field analysis of the model derived is also presented and a prediction on the ground - state magnetic structure in ba@xmath1cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 is formulated .",
    "a complementary group theoretical analysis is presented in section iv .",
    "concluding remarks can be found in section v.",
    "the bandstructure of ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 was calculated within the local density approximation ( lda ) using a recently developed full - potential nonorthogonal local - orbital minimum - basis scheme ( fplo).@xcite here , the cu(3@xmath16 , 4@xmath17 , 4@xmath18 ) , ba(5@xmath17 , 5@xmath18 , 5@xmath16 , 6@xmath17 , 6@xmath18 ) , cl(3@xmath17 , 3@xmath18 , 3@xmath16 ) , and o(2@xmath17 , 2@xmath18 , 3@xmath16 ) states were treated as valence states and the lower lying states as core states . for our purpose to extract tight - binding parameters it is sufficient to perform a non - spinpolarized calculation .",
    "the non - magnetic solution shows metallic behavior with four bands crossing the fermi surface , corresponding to the four copper atoms per unit cell .",
    "hereafter the notations @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 will be used to specify the different cu sites in a unit cell .    due to",
    "the folding of the cuo@xmath1 chains by nearly 90 degrees the bandwidth of the half - filled antibonding bands is relatively narrow ( @xmath5 0.5 ev ) and only half as large as in the planar ( unfolded ) edge - shared chains such as in li@xmath1cuo@xmath1 or cugeo@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the orbital analysis for the four bands at fermi level shows that these bands are built up mainly from the cu@xmath233@xmath24 and the cu@xmath253@xmath26 orbitals , respectively , with an admixture of all three o2@xmath27 , 2@xmath28 , 2@xmath29 orbitals ( the global axes @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are parallel to the crystallographic @xmath9 , @xmath33 and @xmath34axes , respectively ) .",
    "the other cu3@xmath16 orbitals give rise to a band structure ( 16 bands altogether ) which spans the range of binding energies from 2 ev up to 4 ev below the fermi level .",
    "the band states of predominantly o 2@xmath27 , 2@xmath28 , 2@xmath29 character fall into the range of binding energies from @xmath35 2 ev up to @xmath35 6 ev .",
    "the indirect coupling of the cu3@xmath16 orbitals via the intermediate o2@xmath18 orbitals can be described by a set of effective hopping matrix elements .",
    "considering first the top - most four bands formed by the active , i.e.  spin carrying , cu@xmath233@xmath24 and cu@xmath253@xmath26 orbitals we obtained the following results by fitting those bands to a four - band tight - binding ( tb ) model .",
    "@xcite the intra - chain hopping between the neighboring cu@xmath23 and cu@xmath25 sites , @xmath36 65 mev , is of the same order as the inter - chain diagonal cu@xmath37cu@xmath37 hopping , @xmath38    60  mev . considering the hierarchy of transfer processes , the next terms were found to be @xmath39 30 mev which correspond to the inter - chain nearest neighbor hoppings along the @xmath31direction .",
    "the inter - layer hopping parameters along @xmath32direction are very weak .",
    "therefore , the seemingly quasi - one dimensional compound ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 has to be classified , in a first approximation , as a two dimensional compound with spatially anisotropic interactions within a layer and weak couplings between the layers ( which are necessary to explain the 3d magnetism and the experimentally found finite nel temperature ) . that is true also for the exchange couplings of the spins related to the cu@xmath233@xmath40 and cu@xmath253@xmath26 basic orbitals .",
    "below we will consider in great detail the microscopic origin of the dominant intra - chain nearest neighbor interactions that involve rather strong magnetic anisotropies due to the non - trivial geometry of a particular chain .",
    "the remaining inter - chain couplings are expected to influence only the spin isotropic part of the exchange interaction since they occur in a more simple geometry .    to develop the theory of superexchange , in the following the appropriate underlying hubbard model",
    "is formulated for ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 . due to the @xmath3 nature of the spins on the cu@xmath41 sites ,",
    "a single - ion anisotropy can not occur .",
    "a magnetic anisotropy can only be obtained by taking into account simultaneously both , the spin - orbit coupling and the splitting of the orbitals by crystalline fields .",
    "@xcite the spin - orbit coupling of the copper ions is described by the @xmath42 term in the underlying electronic hamiltonian .",
    "this term and the kinetic one , @xmath43 , are considered as the perturbation while the zero - order hamiltonian @xmath44 is a sum of the on - site interactions at copper and oxygen atoms , respectively .",
    "thus , the complete hamiltonian is specified as follows @xmath45 where the hole representation and the standard notation for cuprates are used .",
    "here @xmath46 , which is a composite index , denotes a cell number and the sort of the cu site in the cell ; @xmath47 is used to denote an o site neighboring to the @xmath46site .",
    "the term @xmath48 is the crystal field level for the @xmath49th copper @xmath16orbital at the @xmath46th site .",
    "the results of the band structure calculations @xcite allow to estimate the crystal field splitting between the lowest @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and the excited ( @xmath52 ) levels @xmath48 ( @xmath53 ) as @xmath54ev @xmath55 .",
    "we neglect the difference of this splitting between the different excited @xmath49states as well as between the nonequivalent cu @xmath46sites , which is of minor importance for the present purposes . for the further calculations only the copper on - site coulomb integral , @xmath56 , with @xmath57",
    "is required , which is assumed in analogy with other cuprates to be @xmath58ev .",
    "the crystal field splitting between the different oxygen @xmath59orbitals ( @xmath60 ) located on a lattice site @xmath61 is not taken into account in the present consideration .",
    "the estimate for the `` bare '' charge transfer gap @xmath62ev is deduced from the band structure calculations and a complementary finite cluster analysis .",
    "@xcite for the oxygen on - site coulomb integrals @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( for @xmath65 ) , the following estimates , @xmath66ev and @xmath67ev , standard for the cuprates ( see ref .   and references therein ) , are assumed .",
    "next , we consider the kinetic part , @xmath43 . according to slater and koster ( see ref .  ) one can express the hopping amplitudes @xmath68 between the nearest neighbor copper @xmath69 and oxygen @xmath59orbitals as linear combinations of the two parameters , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . by using the approximation @xmath72 which is valid for transition metal oxides , @xcite one may write @xmath73 . in this expression , for given @xmath69 and @xmath59 , the factor @xmath74 is a function of direction cosines of the @xmath75 vector .",
    "all these factors , of order unity , are calculated by using the routine procedure .",
    "@xcite the only parameter remaining , @xmath76 , is estimated from the bandstructure calculations .",
    "for the special composition of cuo@xmath2 plaquettes in ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 with only nearest neighbor cu - o hopping we obtained the following estimate @xmath77 ev by using the formula @xmath78 . that value is smaller than the corresponding nearest neighbor cu - o hopping terms in other cuprates @xcite since the effects of the different geometry , the neglect of direct o - o transfer and of the crystal field splitting at oxygen sites are all condensed into one effective parameter .",
    "the value @xmath79 ev of the spin - orbit coupling , characteristic for other cuprates , is taken in the calculation .",
    "the derivation of the effective superexchange interactions using perturbation theory in the multi - band hubbard model , has been presented already many times for planar cuprates .",
    "@xcite some peculiarities of the present derivation are due to the fact that the cuo@xmath1-chains in ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 are folded .",
    "the unit cell of this structure contains four different cu ions which are denoted in fig .  2 as b@xmath80 , a@xmath80 , b@xmath1 and a@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , there is a sequence of four different magnetic bonds @xmath81 = @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where the site @xmath86 belongs to the neighboring unit cell .",
    "we start by deriving the spin hamiltonian for a particular ( ab) or ( ba)bond of this sequence , and then extend the consideration to the entire structure . two oxygen ions , @xmath87 , which are common neighbors of cu@xmath23 and cu@xmath25 , mediate the superexchange interaction between cu@xmath23 and cu@xmath25 .",
    "by applying an appropriate unitary transformation one can define molecular - type basic functions for the oxygen single - hole states in the form @xmath88 , that are used below .    at the first step of the expansion procedure the excited @xmath69orbitals ( @xmath89 )",
    "are taken into account by additional vector hybrydization terms @xmath90 connecting the ground state @xmath91orbitals with different @xmath92orbitals .",
    "then , the original hopping processes @xmath93 and the additional new ones can be dealed simultaneously within the same approximation .",

    "it can be directly checked that each magnetic bond is described by the same form of the spin hamiltonian ( [ 4])([8 ] ) . by using the relations ( [ 7][a ] )",

    "it is expected that the ground state in this compound is not a simple collinear antiferromagnetic configuration , but involves also a weak antiferromagnetic superstructure due to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .    to our knowledge , in cuprates only weak ferromagnetism ( wfm ) was reported up to now .",
    "the corresponding spin canting angle , which measures the deviation from collinearity , is rather small , @xmath171 ( compare for instance refs . ) .",
    "in the present case the spin canting angle ( [ 14 ] ) , i.e.  @xmath172 , is more than an order of magnitude larger .",
    "the reason for this difference is the following .",
    "although the spin - orbit coupling @xmath173 is nearly the same in both cases , the geometrical factor is much larger in the present case as @xmath174 due to the strong folding of the chains ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "it is necessary to discuss the possible influence of transverse inter - chain magnetic interactions to show the validity of the derived spin anisotropy .",
    "we assume that the dominant interaction between two neighboring spins belonging to different chains in a layer is the isotropic superexchange with an afm interaction constant @xmath176 . by using the results of the bandstructure calculations ( section ii ) we found the estimate @xmath177 , where @xmath130 is the intra - chain exchange constant .",
    "due to the presence of the center of inversion for the transverse cu - cu magnetic bond a dzyaloshinskii - moriya term can not occur and the symmetric anisotropy is expected to be very weak .",
    "the bandstructure results indicate also a weak inter - layer exchange @xmath178 and more distant inter - chain cu - cu exchange interactions ( for instance to third neighbors in the plane of cu@xmath25 ) .",
    "however , the spin anisotropy of the latter interaction is expected to be small due to the planar geometry of the corresponding exchange path .",
    "in order to derive the spatial order of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya vectors by symmetry considerations , at first the symmetry analysis of the antiferromagnetic states in ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 ( following refs . ) , presented elsewhere @xcite , will be summarized .",
    "it is assumed that the lattice constant @xmath9 of the magnetic unit cell and that of the crystallographic unit cell are identical . as has been pointed out in ref .",

    "the entry + 1 means no change of the considered vector component , -1 means a change of sign . in the line below the resulting magnetic symmetry element",

    "as different components of @xmath220 and @xmath221 belong to different magnetic groups ( table i ) ( i ) only one component of the afm vector @xmath222 may be different from zero , i.e. @xmath222 is parallel to one of the crystallographic axes , and ( ii ) weak ferromagnetism is excluded , contrary to the case of ba@xmath1cu@xmath0o@xmath2cl@xmath1 .",
    "this is in agreement with the experiments .",
    "the symmetry analysis can not predict the direction of the afm vector .",
    "experiments show @xmath210 @xmath213 0.@xcite for that case , independent magnetic symmetry elements are e , rc@xmath180 , rc@xmath179 and i. interestingly , table i shows , that for that case a small @xmath223 @xmath213 0 i.e. weak antiferromagnetism @xcite can additionally occur .    as shown in sect .",
    "iii , within the unit cell this weak antiferromagnetism is described by a sum of dzyaloshinskii - moriya terms @xmath224 this interaction has to be invariant with respect to the symmetry operations rc@xmath180 , rc@xmath179 and i. using the transformation properties of the moments according to table i , the equivalence of sites differing by a lattice translation along the @xmath9axis , results in @xmath225 as to be expected , the spatial order of the local dzyaloshinskii - moriya vectors determined from the symmetry of the magnetic unit cell is the same as that derived by analyzing the relations between the different bonds in the previous section .",
    "moreover the symmetry analysis together with the experimental results shows , that in the transformation described in sect .",
    "iii ( canting of the moments ) the cu@xmath226 moments have to be fixed , as @xmath227 has to remain zero for an afm state with moments parallel to the @xmath9axis .",
    "the superexchange interaction between two neighboring but crystallographically non - equivalent cu ions in ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2cl@xmath1 was analyzed within a multi - orbital hubbard model .",
    "this superexchange interaction was expressed by an effective spin - spin hamiltonian . as there is no center of inversion for the considered cu-(o - o)-cu entity ,",
    "this interaction involves the dzyaloshinskii - moriya term , which refers to the corresponding bond . by means of an analysis of the geometric relations between neighboring bonds ( plaquettes ) the spatial order of these locally defined dzyaloshinskii - moriya vectors",
    "was determined .",
    "this spatial order was also derived by a symmetry analysis taking into account the experimentally found easy axis of the staggered magnetization .",
    "these considerations revealed , that spin canting occurs in the subsystem of the cu@xmath23 magnetic moments only . within the presented microscopic model , for the magnetic moments all directions within the @xmath9-@xmath34plane are equivalent .",
    "the anisotropy , leading to the experimentally observed spin - flop transition for applied fields parallel to the @xmath9axis could not yet be explained .",
    "further investigations have to be done to find the microscopic origin for additional anisotropies , which break the easy - plane symmetry of the superexchange model and explain the experimentally observed easy - axis behavior . with this respect ,",
    "two main contributions have been ignored in the considered hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "first of all , the theory of superexchange can be developed at a more sophisticated level by adopting more details of the electronic structure of the real compound .",
    "for instance , the form of the symmetric anisotropy tensor is rather sensitive to an actual crystal - field splitting of @xmath18orbitals on oxygen ions .",
    "this splitting should be taken into account into the theoretical scheme .",
    "a second reason leading to a breakdown of the easy - plane symmetry involves the direct - exchange contribution @xcite to the symmetric anisotropy term .",
    "this is due to the exchange part of the two - site coulomb multi - orbital @xmath228 correlations which should be also incorporated into the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "however , for such calculations reliable quantitative estimates for the parameters are required ( i.e. the crystal - field states of the o  ions and the two - site exchange coulomb integrals of cu  ions ) . since the direct exchange contribution can be hardly obtained within the lda band structure analysis , we have to leave this problem for future investigations . from an experimentally point of view , the detection of the discussed weak antiferromagnetism is a challenging task .",
