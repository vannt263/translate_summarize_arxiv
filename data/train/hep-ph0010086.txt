    "recent results from super kamiokande@xcite and earlier measurements from soudan-2@xcite and imb@xcite on the relative fluxes of electron and muon type neutrinos produced by the interaction of cosmic rays in the atmosphere show a deficit of muon - type neutrinos .",
    "these results are consistent with the oscillation of @xmath4 into @xmath5 provided that the two mass eigenstates are fully mixed , @xmath6 , and their mass difference is of order @xmath7",
    ". models that can accommodate this mixing have lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) and other lepton number violating processes which are likely to be observable , such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that supersymmetric models can naturally accommodate the flavor violation .",
    "if there is mixing of neutrinos , then one would in general expect mixing of sleptons and sneutrinos in susy .",
    "in general , susy models can have significant flavor mixing .",
    "the slepton mass matrix is a @xmath10 matrix involving the three flavors of left and right sleptons and has the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 label chirality and @xmath13 are generational indices . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the supersymmetry breaking , chirality conserving , slepton masses .",
    "the chirality breaking terms , @xmath16 , contain a flavor diagonal piece @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the corresponding charged lepton mass , @xmath19 is the supersymmetry conserving higgs mass parameter and @xmath20 is the usual ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "additional supersymmetry breaking terms ( @xmath21 terms ) also appear in the chirality mixing term",
    ". these can not be flavor diagonal if , as we require , the neutrino mass matrix is not diagonal in the flavor basis . however , these terms are expected to be proportional to charged lepton masses .",
    "we will therefore make the simplifying assumption that these terms are relevant only for the third generation . in order to accommodate the @xmath4 into @xmath5 mixing",
    ", there must be significant mixing in the stau , smuon sector@xcite .    in the mssm ( minimal supersymmetric standard model )",
    "there is no lepton number violation .",
    "it can be incorporated by adding right handed neutrinos ( @xmath22 ) with couplings to the left handed lepton doublets @xmath23 of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a higgs doublet .",
    "then radiative corrections at one loop will induce lepton number violating terms in the mass matrices for the left sleptons .",
    "there can also be similar soft supersymmetry breaking @xmath21 terms .",
    "we therefore assume the following form for the slepton mass matrix in the @xmath26 basis @xcite : @xmath27\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "minimal supersymmetric models such as sugra are recovered by neglecting @xmath31 .",
    "the super kamiokande results suggest @xmath32    it has been suggested that this large flavor violation in the slepton sector could be observed indirectly via the decay @xmath33@xcite . by contrast , this paper considers direct signals from the observation of lepton flavor non - conservation in the susy sector at the lhc .",
    "we will demonstrate that , in certain cases , the direct observation is more sensitive than the flavor violating tau decay .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] defines a sample point based on the minimal sugra model that has been studied in detail , and section  [ sec : tau ] explains how sensitivity to @xmath34 flavor violation can be observed at the lhc for this model .",
    "section  [ sec : rare ] compares the sensitivity for this direct search with that from the rare decay @xmath35 .",
    "section  [ sec : general ] presents results indicating the range of parameters in the minimal sugra model for which such direct searches might be feasible .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : concl ] presents a summary and conclusions .",
    "we consider a minimal sugra@xcite point with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "we use the isajet@xcite implementation of the sugra model .",
    "this point is identical to one of those studied in detail@xcite ( sugra point 5 ) except for the value of @xmath20 .",
    "the larger @xmath20 gives a light higgs mass of @xmath41 , consistent with the current lep limit@xcite .",
    "the masses are calculated with isajet  7.49 , which assumes @xmath42 .",
    "a modification was made to make available the complete slepton mass matrix , giving access to all the soft mass parameters at the electroweak scale _ viz . _ : @xmath43 the mass eigenvalues for @xmath42 are @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the lighter of the two mass eigenstates resulting from the mixing of @xmath46 and @xmath47 . ) note that in sugra type models the @xmath48 are generally lighter than the @xmath49 .",
    "the dominant final states for @xmath50 decay are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and @xmath54 which have branching ratios of 6.9% , 12.8% ( for both @xmath55 and @xmath19 ) , and 66.1% respectively .",
    "the @xmath56 branching ratios are 45.3% for @xmath57 and 54.4% for @xmath58 .",
    "direct drell - yan production of sleptons at the lhc has a small cross section ( 270 fb for all sleptons in the case considered ) and is difficult to separate from susy backgrounds .",
    "in contrast the total susy rate , made up largely of squark and gluino production is  100 times larger .",
    "gluinos ( of mass 706 gev ) decay to squarks ( average mass 620 gev ) with an almost 100% branching ratio and left - squarks have a 30% branching ratio to @xmath50 ( of mass 212 gev ) .",
    "hence the most copious source of observed dileptons from sleptons in this case is @xmath59 where the @xmath50 arises in squark decay",
    ". this will always be the case provided that the decay is allowed .",
    "if only @xmath48 is produced in this way ( in the case studied @xmath49 is heavier than @xmath50 ) , then the main effect of @xmath60 is to add a component of @xmath61 in @xmath45 so that @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath64 mass is 116 gev .",
    "this decay gives a @xmath65 signal and produces an asymmetry between @xmath65 and @xmath66 final states .",
    "the slepton mass matrix was rediagonalized using the soft mass parameters given above plus the mixing term @xmath67 , inducing mixings among slepton flavors and hence flavor - violating decays such as @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the resulting branching ratios for @xmath70 and for @xmath71 through an intermediate @xmath45 with at least one lepton - flavor violating decay are shown in figure  [ c10br ] .",
    "the latter decay is uninteresting both because it is small and because it can not be separated from the @xmath72 final state for which both taus decay to muons .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the @xmath73 decay followed by a hadronic tau decay .",
    "note that the mass shifts in the lightest states are very small . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the masses of the lightest states change by @xmath75 mev ; the heavier states are more strongly affected , their masses become 221 and 243 gev ; the mass of @xmath76 is , of course , unchanged at 231 gev .",
    "a sample of 600000 susy events was generated with isajet  7.49 , equivalent to an integrated luminosity of @xmath77 fb@xmath78 .",
    "the detector response is parameterized by gaussian resolutions characteristic of the atlas@xcite detector without any non - gaussian tails . in the central region of rapidity",
    "we take separate resolutions for the electromagnetic ( emcal ) and hadronic ( hcal ) calorimeters , while the forward region uses a common resolution : @xmath79 all energy and momenta are measured in gev .",
    "a uniform segmentation @xmath80 is used with no transverse or longitudinal shower spreading . both atlas@xcite and cms@xcite",
    "have finer segmentation over most of the rapidity range .",
    "an oversimplified parameterization of the muon momentum resolution of the atlas detector including both the inner tracker and the muon system measurements is used , _ viz _",
    "@xmath81 in the case of electrons we take a momentum resolution obtained by combining the electromagnetic calorimeter resolution above with a tracking resolution of the form @xmath82 this provides a slight improvement over the calorimeter alone .",
    "missing transverse energy is calculated by taking the magnitude of the vector sum of the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter cells .",
    "jets are found using getjet@xcite with a simple fixed - cone algorithm .",
    "the jet multiplicity in susy events is rather large , so we have used a cone size of @xmath83 unless otherwise stated .",
    "jets are required to have at least @xmath84  gev ; more stringent cuts are often used .",
    "all leptons are required to be isolated and have some minimum @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the isolation requirement is that no more than 10  gev of additional @xmath87 be present in a cone of radius @xmath88 around the lepton to reject leptons from @xmath89-jets and @xmath90-jets .",
    "susy production at the lhc is dominated by the production of squarks and gluinos , which decay via cascades to the lightest susy particle @xmath64 , which escapes the detector .",
    "events were therefore selected by requiring multiple jets plus large @xmath91 :    * @xmath92 jets with @xmath93 and @xmath94 ; * @xmath95 ; * @xmath96 ;    the same analysis was applied to the standard model background .",
    "isajet  7.44 was used to generate 250000 events each of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 and 2500000 qcd jets , divided among five @xmath85 bins covering @xmath101 .",
    "the cut on @xmath102 was chosen to make this background fairly small but still visible .",
    "these background samples represent much smaller integrated luminosity that the signal sample , so the resulting statistical fluctuations are large when they are scaled to the appropriate integrated luminosity .    for events that pass this selection , an additional requirement that there be two isolated leptons with @xmath103 gev and @xmath104",
    "the dilepton mass distribution for opposite sign , same flavor pairs is shown in figure  [ c10mll ] and shows the characteristic endpoint for slepton mediated decay .",
    "the end - point occurs at @xmath105 a small @xmath106 peak is also visible , primarily from the 6.9% branching ratio for @xmath107 .",
    "the events in the opposite sign , opposite flavor sample are due to decays of the type @xmath108 and from events with leptons arising from @xmath109 decay which are not subject to the kinematic constraint .",
    "selection of hadronic @xmath110 decays was based on the actual hadronic tau decays plus the reconstruction efficiency and jet rejection based on the full simulation analysis@xcite done for an earlier study@xcite .",
    "pile - up effects have been ignored , so the results are applicable only at low luminosity , @xmath111 . for each hadronic @xmath110 decay with @xmath112 and @xmath113 ,",
    "the direction was found .",
    "a matching jet with @xmath113 was then sought with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "if such a jet was found , it was tagged as a @xmath110 with a probability of 66% ; its charge was assigned correctly with a probability of 92% .",
    "jets not so tagged were assigned as @xmath110 s using an approximate parameterization of the jet/@xmath110 rejection shown in figure  9 - 31 of ref .  ,",
    "@xmath116 where @xmath117 is the hadronic @xmath110 efficiency and @xmath85 is in gev .",
    "we choose @xmath118 .",
    "the efficiency and the results using the parameterization of@xcite are not very different .",
    "note that we are actually using the hadronic jet resolution for all @xmath110 decays here , not the improved resolution for a subset of decays as in the earlier analysis @xcite which was focussed on the invariant mass of a pair of taus , both decaying hadronically .",
    "since this analysis relies mainly on counting events , the resolution on the measurement of the hadronic @xmath110 decay products is not crucial .",
    "the visible ( hadronic ) @xmath119 mass for hadronic @xmath110 decays ( hereafter denoted by @xmath120 ) is shown in figure  [ c10mtautau ] . here",
    "events were required to have two @xmath120 candidates in addition to the cuts listed above .",
    "note that one or both of these candidates could be the same jets that were used in the initial event selection .",
    "the background from misidentified qcd jets is approximately random in sign and so cancels in the @xmath121 combination . to the extent that @xmath122 and @xmath123 production dominates , so does the background where both @xmath110 s come from @xmath56 decay .",
    "figure  [ c10mtautau ] shows an excess of @xmath124 pairs ending approximately at the endpoint of the dilepton distribution ( from @xmath125 ) shown in figure  [ c10mll ] .",
    "the structure is less clear due to the energy carried off by the neutrinos .",
    "even for @xmath42 there is a substantial rate for real @xmath126 pairs from @xmath110 pairs produced by the decay chain @xmath127 .",
    "two independent chargino decays can also give @xmath128 pairs of either sign .",
    "misidentified qcd jets give additional @xmath129 pairs ; the signs of @xmath119 pairs from such misidentified jets should be random , and this is assumed here .",
    "the lfv mixing from @xmath60 produces additional @xmath130 pairs , 92% of which have signs that are correctly identified .",
    "figure  [ c10mltaulfv10 ] shows the os and ss backgrounds and the signal for an assumed 10% branching ratio for the direct decay @xmath131 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath132 ( see figure  [ c10br ] ) .",
    "since isajet assumes lepton flavor conservation , the decay of interest was simulated by finding events with two @xmath110 s consistent with @xmath133 and with at least one hadronic @xmath110 decay and then replacing the other @xmath110 with a muon with a probability equal to the assumed branching ratio .",
    "this is an excellent approximation since , as is indicated above , the mass shift due to mixing is very small .",
    "figure  [ c10mltaudiflfv ] shows the signal and the sign - subtracted background .",
    "the latter should cancel in the subtracted @xmath134 distribution up to statistical fluctuations ; the lfv signal occurs only in the @xmath73 channel .",
    "the distribution from the lfv signal has a peak at larger values of invariant mass than that of the lepton flavor conserving process as the lepton in the latter must arise from the decay of a tau and is therefore softer than that the muon from @xmath135    in figure  [ c10mltaulfv10 ] for @xmath136 , there are 1089 os and 707 ss events , with equal numbers of @xmath137 and @xmath73 , and there are 518 lepton flavor violating @xmath73 events , 92% of which are correctly identified as to sign .",
    "hence in this mass range we expect @xmath138 adding the errors in quadrature , we would then measure @xmath139 giving a @xmath140 excess for @xmath141 .",
    "the statistical @xmath142 limit for @xmath143 would be a branching ratio of @xmath144 , corresponding to @xmath145 .",
    "the signal to background ratio is better in the sign subtracted distributions , but the statistical errors are larger . a determination of the branching ratio from the observation of an excess of @xmath73 events requires a detailed understanding of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the scaling of these results to the design lhc luminosity also requires a careful study of the effects of pile up of low-@xmath85 hadronic events .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the sensitivity that we obtain from direct slepton decay is comparable to that claimed for a lepton collider operating at 500 gev center of mass energy for @xmath143@xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath35 is sensitive to the same lepton flavor violation as the signal considered here .",
    "the approximate formula of ref .",
    ", @xmath146 gives for @xmath74 and @xmath147 @xmath148 however this result is sensitive to the details of the mass spectra and mixings ; cancellations can occur resulting in much smaller rates@xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the current bound is @xmath149@xcite .",
    "the total production of @xmath150 at the lhc is about @xmath151 events for an integrated luminosity of @xmath152 .",
    "a study@xcite carried out for the atlas detector concluded that a 90% confidence level upper limit of @xmath153 on @xmath154 could be reached using @xmath155 events for an integrated luminosity of @xmath143 corresponding to three years of running at low luminosity .",
    "the process is background limited from qed final state radiation in the decays @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "these contribute approximately 50 events for @xmath143 .",
    "we have demonstrated , by using a specific example , how flavor violation in the slepton sector can be observed at the lhc . it would be difficult to repeat the analysis for a large number of other cases . in order to estimate the generality of the method we have adopted a simpler approach .",
    "the crucial feature is the production of staus in decays of @xmath50 . for fixed values of @xmath21 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the parameter space of @xmath158 and @xmath159 was scanned . at each point , all masses and branching ratios were computed assuming that there is no slepton flavor mixing . if the gluino is lighter than the up and down squarks , then the product branching ratio @xmath160 is computed , if the gluino is heavier than the up and down squarks the combination @xmath161 is calculated .",
    "the total supersymmetric cross section is determined at a few points in the parameter space and can be approximated by @xmath162 this formula agrees with the cross - section to within 25% for all relavant paramters ; the dependence on @xmath21 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 is small .",
    "an approximation of the total production rate for @xmath163 from @xmath50 arising from squark and gluino production and decay can then be obtained from the product of the cross - section and the combined branching ratio .",
    "figures  [ c3rate ] through [ c30rate ] show the resulting rates , and figure  [ tmass ] shows two sample sets of contours of the @xmath163 mass .",
    "the light higgs mass is required to be larger than 103  gev in making these plots ; this accounts for the cut off at smaller values of @xmath159 for @xmath164 .",
    "rasing the limit to 107 gev excludes the region below @xmath165 gev for @xmath40 .",
    "the current bound on the higgs mass for such a small value of @xmath20 is approximately 112 gev @xcite . at this value @xmath159",
    "is so large that the production rate is less than 0.1 fb .",
    "the effect of this bound should be taken _",
    "cum grano salis _ as uncomputed higher order corrections could modify the relationship between the model parameters and the higgs mass .",
    "the higgs limit has no impact on the plots with @xmath166 .",
    "the lack of rate at large values of @xmath159 is due to the large gluino and squark masses and the consequent small production rate .",
    "the region where @xmath167 is not accessible as there the decay @xmath168 is not allowed kinematically . for comparison ,",
    "the case studied in detail would correspond to a @xmath45 rate of @xmath169 fb according to figure  [ c10rate ] .",
    "a comparison of this value with the rates shown in figure  [ c10mtautau ] shows that the combination of acceptance and tau detection efficiency is approximately 2% .",
    "this is not expected to vary dramatically over the relavent parameter space as the kinematics of production and decay are broadly similar .",
    "the acceptance will be less near the boundary where @xmath170 as the resulting taus will be soft .",
    "the acceptance is greater at larger values of @xmath158 or @xmath159 where events are more central and the resulting taus more energetic . at a luminosity of @xmath171 @xmath172",
    "sec@xmath78 a meaningful measurement should be possible if the rate is larger than 1 pb . an examination of the plots shows that this covers a sizable fraction of parameter space .",
    "a detailed quantitative assessment of the sensitive region is not straightforward .",
    "this is because the background arises from supersymmetry itself and not from standard model sources .",
    "the background therefore varies across parameter space , so a more detailed sensitivity estimate would require repeating the full analysis at each point .",
    "the identification of @xmath120 decays requires tight cuts on the shower shape and track multiplicity , so it becomes more difficult at high luminosity , @xmath173 . for high susy masses , however ,",
    "the @xmath120 typically have higher @xmath85 and so are more easily distinguished from qcd jets . extending the analysis described here to high luminosity requires a much more detailed and detector - specific study of pileup effects than has been done here .",
    "if it proves to be possible , then the parameter space where the rate is larger than 0.1 pb should be accessible .",
    "this covers almost all of the physically interesting region where the decay @xmath174 is allowed .",
    "we have demonstrated that the observation of lepton flavor violation may be possible at the lhc .",
    "we have focussed on the case where the largest violation occurs in the @xmath175 sector . while this is motivated by the atmospheric neutrino problem this violation is harder to detect than that occuring in the @xmath176 sector since the detection of hadronically decaying taus",
    "is involved .",
    "if sleptons are produced in the decays of squarks and gluinos the rates are large enough that the resulting sensitivity is greater than can be reached in rare decays of the type @xmath177 .",
    "this corresponds to the fraction of parameter space where @xmath178 . in the sugra model",
    "the fraction of parameter space where these decays occur with a rate large enough for observation is large .",
    "if sleptons are not produced in these decays , the sensitivity will be much less .",
    "a study of the possibility of observing direct slepton production for the mass spectrum considered ( without flavor violation)@xcite .",
    "stringent jet veto cuts are required to reduce the backgrounds from other susy events .",
    "approximately 50 events from @xmath179 production were found in @xmath143 and a mass sensitivity of 20 gev obtained .",
    "note that this sensitivity is comparable to the mass shifts induced in the @xmath180 sector for @xmath74 .",
    "a more detailed study is needed before a definite conclusion can be made , but it appears that this process might also be more sensitive than the @xmath181 decay .",
    "the importance of @xmath120 decays for susy extends beyond the lepton flavor violating signal considered here .",
    "if @xmath182 , then the decays @xmath183 and @xmath184 can be the only allowed two - body decays and so have branching ratios close to unity ; then @xmath110 signatures dominate@xcite .",
    "for any value of @xmath20 , @xmath120 signatures can provide information both on the splitting between @xmath45 and @xmath48 and on the mixing between @xmath47 and @xmath46@xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to continue a detailed study of @xmath120 signatures for the lhc detectors .",
