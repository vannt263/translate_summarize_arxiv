    "many problems of fluid thermo - mechanics involving unbounded domains occur in many areas of applications , e.g. flows of a liquid in duct systems , fluid flows through a thin or long pipe or through a system of pipes in hemodynamics and so on . from a numerical point of view , these formulations are not convenient and quite practical .",
    "therefore , an efficient natural way is to cut off unbounded parts of the domain by introducing an artificial boundary in order to limit the computational work .",
    "then the original problem posed in an unbounded domain is approximated by a problem in a smaller bounded computational region with artificial boundary conditions prescribed at the cut boundaries .",
    "hence , let @xmath1 be a bounded domain in @xmath2 with boundary @xmath3 . in a physical sense",
    ", @xmath4 represents a `` truncated '' region of an unbounded system of pipes occupied by a moving heat - conducting viscous incompressible fluid .",
    "@xmath5 will denote the `` lateral '' surface and @xmath6 represents the open parts ( cut boundaries ) of the piping system .",
    "it is physically reasonable to assume that in / outflow pipe segments extend as straight pipes .",
    "more precisely , @xmath7 and @xmath6 are @xmath8-smooth open disjoint not necessarily connected subsets of @xmath9 such that @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the @xmath18dimensional measure of @xmath19 is zero and @xmath20 are smooth nonintersecting curves ( this means that @xmath20 are smooth curved nonintersecting edges and vertices ( conical points ) on @xmath3 are excluded ) .",
    "moreover , all portions of @xmath6 are taken to be flat and @xmath5 and @xmath6 form a right angle @xmath21 at all points of @xmath19 ( in the sense of tangential planes ) , see figure [ pipe ] .",
    "the flow of a viscous incompressible heat - conducting fluid is governed by balance equations for linear momentum , mass and internal energy @xcite : @xmath22 here @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the unknown velocity , pressure and temperature , respectively .",
    "tensor @xmath26 denotes the symmetric part of the velocity gradient .",
    "data of the problem are as follows : @xmath27 is a body force and @xmath28 a heat source term .",
    "positive constant material coefficients represent the kinematic viscosity @xmath29 , reference density @xmath30 , heat conductivity @xmath31 and specific heat at constant volume @xmath32 . following the well - known boussinesq approximation ,",
    "the temperature dependent density is used in the energy equation and to compute the buoyancy force @xmath33 on the right - hand side of equation .",
    "everywhere else in the model , @xmath34 is replaced by the reference value @xmath35 .",
    "change of density @xmath34 with temperature is given by strictly positive , nonincreasing and continuous function , such that @xmath36 the energy balance equation takes into account the phenomena of the viscous energy dissipation and adiabatic heat effects .",
    "for rigorous derivation of the model like  we refer the readers to @xcite .",
    "rigorously derived asymptotic models describing stationary motion of heat - conducting incompressible viscous fluid through pipe - like domains can be found in @xcite .    to complete the model , suitable boundary and initial conditions have to be added .",
    "concerning the boundary conditions of the flow , it is a standard situation to prescribe a homogeneous no - slip boundary condition for the velocity of the fluid on the fixed walls of the channel , i.e. @xmath37 since nothing is known in advance about the flow through the open parts , it is really not clear what type of boundary condition for the velocity should be prescribed on @xmath6 .",
    "the condition frequently used in numerical practice for viscous parallel flows is the most simple outflow boundary condition of the form @xmath38 which seems to be natural since it does not prescribe anything on the cut cross - section of an in / outlets of the truncated region .",
    "therefore , this condition is usually called the `` do nothing '' ( or `` free outflow '' ) boundary condition . in , @xmath39 is the outer unit normal vector to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , while quantities @xmath42 are given functions .",
    "in particular , for time - dependent flows , @xmath42 are given functions of time .",
    "boundary condition results from a variational principle and does not have a real physical meaning . for further discussion on theoretical aspects as well as practical difficulties of this boundary condition and the physical meaning of the quantities",
    "@xmath42 we refer to @xcite .",
    "assume that @xmath42 are given smooth functions of time on @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and consider the smooth extension @xmath43 on @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "introducing the new variable @xmath46 this amounts to solving the problem with the homogeneous `` do nothing '' boundary condition transferring the data from the right - hand side of the boundary condition to the right - hand side of the linear momentum balance equation .",
    "hence , for simplicity , we assume throughout this paper , without loss of generality , that @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48    concerning the heat transfer through the walls of pipes we consider the newton boundary condition @xmath49 in which @xmath50 designates the heat transfer coefficient , @xmath51 is the prescribed temperature outside the computational domain and @xmath52 represents the heat flux imposed on the lateral surfaces . on the open parts of the piping system we use the classical outflow ( `` do nothing '' )",
    "condition @xmath53 initial conditions are considered as the given initial velocity field @xmath54 and the temperature profile @xmath55 over the flow domain @xmath56    obtained results in this paper can be extended to problems with dirichlet or the mixed ( dirichlet - neumann ) boundary conditions for the temperature on the walls .",
    "namely , instead of , we can consider ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) @xmath59    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] , we introduce basic notations and some appropriate function spaces in order to precisely formulate our problem .",
    "furthermore , we rewrite the energy equation by using the appropriate enthalpy transformation . in section [ main_result ] , we present the strong form of the model for the non - stationary motion of viscous incompressible heat - conducting fluids in a system of 3d pipes considered in our work , specify our smoothness assumptions on data and formulate the problem in a variational setting .",
    "we also provide the bibliographic remarks on the subject and indicate what kind of difficulties we should overcome in the process .",
    "the main result , the existence of strong - weak solutions , stated at the end of section [ main_result ] , is proved in section  [ sec : proof ] .",
    "the proof rests on application of schauder fixed point theorem .",
    "first , we present basic results on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to auxiliary problems , the decoupled initial - boundary value problems for the non - stationary stokes system with mixed boundary conditions and the parabolic convection - diffusion equation with the nonlinear boundary condition . in the proof of the main result we rely on the energy estimates for auxiliary problems , regularity of stationary solutions to the stokes problem and interpolations - like inequalities .",

    "the main advantage of the formulation of the navier - stokes equations in free divergence spaces is that the pressure @xmath24 is eliminated from the system .",
    "having @xmath93 in hand , this unknown can be recovered in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly describe some difficulties we have to solve in our work .",
