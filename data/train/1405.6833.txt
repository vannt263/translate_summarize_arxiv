    "solar _ prominences _ are thread - like clouds consisting of relatively cool and dense magnetized plasma , suspended in the hot and tenuous corona . known also as _ filaments _ ( used interchangeably with prominences hereafter ) , they appear as dark features along the polarity inversion line ( pil ) when viewed on the disk , typically in h@xmath0 filtergrams .",
    "twisted / sheared magnetic field plays a crucial role in the equilibrium and dynamic evolution of prominences ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . the remarkably stable equilibrium achieved by prominences and",
    "their sudden eruptions pose a great challenge for our understanding of the physics governing the destabilizing of the solar corona .",
    "prominence eruptions have close association with flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ; see the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the three eruptive phenomena are hence suggested to be different manifestations of a single physical process , which involves the large - scale disruption and restructuring of the coronal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the corona is energized by photospheric or sub - photospheric activities , such as shearing motions near pils ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , emerging magnetic flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and flux cancellation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but it is still under debate how exactly coronal eruptions are triggered .",
    "a large number of mechanisms have been proposed , which include , but are not limited to , tether - cutting reconnection in a sheared arcade @xcite , breakout reconnection at a magnetic null point in a quadrupolar configuration @xcite , flux emergence @xcite , catastrophic loss of equilibrium @xcite through either photospheric flux cancellation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or an artificial increase in either the poloidal or the axial flux of a flux rope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ideal mhd instabilities such as the helical kink instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the torus instability @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied a `` double - decker '' filament , which was composed of two branches separated in height .",
    "they found that prior to the eruption of the upper branch , multiple filament threads within the lower branch brightened up , rose upward , and merged into the upper branch .",
    "this transfer of magnetic flux and current to the upper branch is suggested to be the key mechanism responsible for its loss of equilibrium by reaching the limiting flux that can be stably held down by the overlying field @xcite or by reaching the threshold of the torus instability @xcite .    in this paper , we present the observation of a similar transfer of magnetic flux to a prominence through multiple rising ` mini - prominences ' originally located on the surface . in the sections that follows , we investigate the evolution and eruption of the prominence , which was embedded in the side - arcade of a quadrupolar field configuration ( section  [ sec : observations ] ) .",
    "we argue that these mini - prominences are of the same nature as chromospheric fibrils (  [ sec : nature ] ) , and then discuss the relevant mechanisms for the prominence eruption (  [ sec : instability ] and  [ sec : reconnection ] ) , which was apparently coupled to the eruption of the other side - arcade in the quadrupolar field .",
    "the prominence was observed on the west limb in euv by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; * ? ? ?",

    "the eruption started as early as 23:49 ut on 2012 october 21 ( see  [ subsec : height ] ) .",
    "the ls erupted southwestward and left the disk at about 03:16 ut ( sta s perspective ; fig .",
    "[ fig : total_erupt](d ) ) , whereas the prominence erupted northwestward , and was still projected onto the disk center by the same time .",
    "this does not necessarily imply a difference in their propagation speeds , but due probably to ls s faster expansion , as can be seen from the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : total_erupt ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the prominence was apparently writhed at the onset of the eruption ( sdo s perspective ; fig .",

    "[ fig : orig ] ) . during the eruption ,",
    "the prominence underwent a clockwise rotation of its axis , and consequently the s - shape was apparently straightened ( fig .",

    "this is opposite to the conversion of magnetic twist into writhe , in which case a counterclockwise rotation is expected if the flux rope assumes a forward s - shape @xcite .",

    "a sequence of reconnection events is characterized by successive brightenings at the surface .",
    "the 1st episode of brightening ( b1 ) occurred in the central region between the prominence and the ls at about 01:40 ut ( fig .",

    "[ fig : erupt_195](d ) ) .",
    "the 2nd episode of brightening ( b2 ) appeared to be related to ls s eruption ( fig .",
    "[ fig : erupt_195](d ) ) , and the 3rd episode ( b3 ) took on the form of a two - ribbon flare ( fig .  [ fig : erupt_195](f ) ) , associated with the prominence eruption . both b1 and b2 had an irregular",
    ", moss - like appearance initially and later became the footprints of some transient brightening loops labeled t1 and t2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : erupt_195](e ) , see also the accompanying animation ) .",
    "prior to the brightenings b1 and b2 , two pairs of dimming regions were observed to be located at both sides of the prominence and the ls , respectively ( marked by arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : erupt_195](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "coronal dimmings are often interpreted as a mass deficit due to eruptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dimmings in pair have only been occasionally observed and was suggested to represent the feet of an eruptive flux rope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .",
    "the eruption results in two cme fronts as observed by lasco / c3 ( see the inset of fig .  [ fig : cme ] ) .",
    "we may identify the source of the leading front with the ls and that of the trailing front with the prominence .",
    "linear fitting of their height - time profiles yields that the leading front propagated at ( 328@xmath12 ) km s@xmath2 in the plane of sky , slightly slower than the trailing front , which propagated at ( 412@xmath14 ) km s@xmath2 .",
    "hence , the trailing front might eventually catch up with the leading front and interact with it ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to explore the physical mechanism of the eruption as described in ",
    "[ sec : erupt ] , we investigate the pre - eruption processes that might help make the prominence ` ready ' to erupt . what stands out is that within 2 days prior to its eruption the prominence was ` fed ' for at least three times by mini - prominences originally resting on the surface .",
    "this process is referred to as ` flux feeding ' hereafter . in this paper",
    ", we emphasize on the role of magnetic flux as far as ` feeding ' is concerned , although this process involves both magnetic and mass flux ( see  [ sec : instability ] ) .",
    "the mini - prominences appear similar in emissivity as , but much smaller in spatial scales ( @xmath3 in length and width ) than , the target prominence in euv images . in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_slice ] we study these feeding processes by placing a virtual slit along the rising direction of the mini - prominences , and present the resultant stack plots in a logarithm scale . during each feeding process",
    ", a miniature prominence rose upward apparently from the solar surface at a speed of tens of kilometers per second , interacted with , and eventually merged into , the target prominence .",
    "the interaction is characterized by an enhancement in brightness , and a decrease in speed , as the mini - prominences approached the target prominence .",
    "each feeding process lasted for about half an hour .",
    "the first feeding process , which took place at about 09:00 ut on 2012 october 20 , is particularly interesting ( see the animation accompanying fig .  [",
    "fig : perturbation1 ] ) .",
    "the upward - moving mini - prominence apparently drove the oscillation of two threads within the target prominence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : total_slice](d ) ) .",
    "detailed analysis is shown in figure [ fig : perturbation1 ] .",
    "the mini - prominence became visible as early as 08:20 ut , as a fibril - like structure .",
    "it started to rise at approximately 08:55 ut , with an acceleration of 22@xmath11 m  s@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perturbation1](i ) ) . at about 09:05 ut , the upward moving turned into a deceleration of -5.9@xmath10.6 m  s@xmath4 , indicating an interaction with the prominence overhead .",
    "this compression process may result in the brightening of the mini - prominence from 09:05 ut onward , as well as the oscillation of the prominence threads at higher altitudes shortly after that time ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : total_slice](d ) ) .",
    "the oscillation can be well fitted with a damped cosine function : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 corresponds to the amplitude , period , and e - folding damping time , respectively .",
    "the two threads oscillated with essentially the same period , but the oscillation of the upper thread started slightly later , had a smaller amplitude , and decayed slower than the lower thread ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perturbation1](i ) ) , suggesting that the oscillations were due to an upward - propagating wave which was excited by the interaction of the mini - prominence with the target prominence .",
    "the velocity amplitude was about 19 and 14 km  s@xmath2 for the lower and upper thread , respectively , significantly larger than that of small - amplitude oscillations ( from 0.1 to several kilometers per second ) that are apparently ever - present in prominences @xcite .",
    "the present observation therefore provides an alternative cause for large - amplitude prominence oscillations ( velocity amplitude @xmath9 km  s@xmath2 ) , which are relatively rare and have been suggested to be triggered by waves and disturbances produced by flares or jets @xcite .",
    "the eventual merge of the mini - prominence with the target prominence is characterized by knots of filament material moving along the prominence axis bi - directionally at tens of kilometers per second , reminiscent of counter - streaming flows in prominences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the space - time plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perturbation1](j ) ) obtained from the virtual slit parallel to the prominence axis ( slit b in figure [ fig : perturbation1](b ) ) clearly shows that such horizontal motions became appreciable in 171   images only after the merge at about 09:20 ut ( also see the animation accompanying fig .  [",
    "fig : perturbation1 ] ) .",
    "however , counter - streaming flows are believed to be ubiquitous in prominences , despite that its cause remains unclear ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) .",
    "the fact that the horizontal motion excited by the disturbance from the rising mini - prominence well resembles counter - streaming flows suggests that such flows are dictated by the magnetic nature of prominences .",
    "it is known that the prominence field is dominantly horizontal and directed along the prominence axis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may explain the observed horizontal motions as well as the absence of vertical motions within the perturbed prominence .",
    "the hight - time profile of the mini - prominence is fitted with a piecewise parabolic function , with a uniform acceleration followed by deceleration .",
    "the fitting results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : perturbation1](i ) .",
    "the second and third episodes of flux feeding are shown in the middle and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : total_slice ] , respectively .",
    "unlike the first episode , there were no discernible oscillations resulting from the interaction , and the acceleration phase was less appreciable , so that both hight - time profiles can be well fitted with a uniform deceleration function with @xmath10 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath11 m s@xmath12 .",
    "that the flux - feeding processes affected the evolution of the prominence is evidenced by its height - time profile . with the ` scc_measure ` procedure in solarsoftware , the ` true ' height , rather than projected height , of the prominence can be obtained . the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : height ] shows the height - time profile of the prominence starting from 2012 october 17 till the prominence eruption on october 22 .",
    "the vertical dashed lines mark the occurrences of the three episodes of flux feeding .",
    "the average speed till the occurrence of the 1st episode is @xmath13 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "similarly , @xmath14 km  s@xmath2 denotes the average speed between the 1st and 2nd episode , and @xmath15 km  s@xmath2 the average speed between the 2nd and 3rd episode .",
    "one can see that the average rising speed of the prominence was significantly enhanced with the flux - feeding processes , as compared with the long time interval before the occurrence of the 1st episode .",
    "this might be due to the magnetic - flux increase of the prominence , and therefore the strengthening of the outward magnetic pressure of the prominence field over the inward magnetic tension of the external field .",
    "the eruptive process on 2012 october 22 can be well fitted by an exponential function with an initial height @xmath16 and velocity @xmath17 : @xmath18 the fitting yields that @xmath19 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath20 s. let the linear term equal to the exponential term , we are able to determine that the prominence eruption started at 0.154  @xmath21 at 23:49 ut on 2012 october 21 .",
    "the flux - feeding process is reminiscent of the flux transfer within the double - decker filament as reported by @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "the merge of the mini - prominences into the target prominence also feeds magnetic flux and current to the latter , resulting in an increasing speed of its quasi - static ascent , and eventually leading up to its unstableness .",
    "so , are the mini - prominences part of the lower branch of a double - decker filament ?",
    "the main body of the lower branch could be lying beneath the photosphere so that only the upper branch was observed as the target prominence . if the lower branch emerges , then a double - deck configuration ensues .",
    "the hinode observation that a flux rope emerges under a pre - existing filament @xcite might be such a case .        back to the present study",
    ", the mini - prominences were observed in aia 304   as thin elongated structures lying on the surface before rising upward to interact with the target prominence . in morphology , they are very similar to chromospheric fibrils , which cover most of the disk in h@xmath0 line core . however , taking the first mini - prominence as an example ( marked by a white arrow in fig .  [",
    "fig : fibril](a ) ) , one can not easily find its counterpart in h@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fibril](b ) ) .",
    "in contrast , a slightly thicker fibril ( marked by black arrows ) at about @xmath22 to the northeast of the mini - prominence can be seen in both 304   and h@xmath0 .",
    "hence , this could be due to the relatively poor resolution of the h@xmath0 images , whose contrast are further plagued by the seeing conditions . as it rose above the limb",
    ", the mini - prominence can also be observed in h@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fibril](c ) ) , suggesting it is indeed of the same nature as fibrils .",
    "this is not surprising as filaments and fibrils are closely related in the sense that a prerequisite for a filament is a channel of chromospheric fibrils aligned with the polarity boundary , known as `` filament channel '' @xcite .",
    "arguably the tracer of the chromospheric field @xcite , fibrils can be regarded as small flux tubes .",
    "apparently attracted to the target prominence , these rising fibrils must carry currents in the same direction , or , helicity of the same sign , as the prominence , in light of the mhd simulations of interactions between parallel flux tubes done by @xcite",
    ". however , there still exists a possibility that these fibrils actually belong to a flux rope lying beneath the surface , serving as the lower branch of a double - deck configuration .",
    "it is worth commenting that the rising fibrils are distinct from buoyant plumes detected in off - limb observations @xcite , which are dark , bubble - like features in visible - light spectral bands , rising and inflating through the bright prominence emission with approximately constant speeds .",
    "in contrast to the plumes , the fibrils appear in emission above the limb and in absorption on the disk , same as the prominence in terms of emissivity ; they rise from the surface and merge into the prominence with obvious deceleration , but no significant inflation .",
    "the low - lying forward s - shaped prominence rotated clockwise at the onset of the eruption , and it is not clear whether it was still kinked during the eruption . that the s - shape was apparently straightened due to the clockwise rotation implies a reduction of writhe , therefore excluding the helical kink instability as the trigger of the eruption @xcite .",
    "however , the exponential rise of the prominence and the lack of intense heating during the initial phase of the eruption suggests that a certain instability or loss of equilibrium may play an important role .",
    "here we discuss three related mechanisms : a ) flux imbalance , b ) mass loading , and c ) torus instability .",
    "numerical studies have suggested that a flux rope could become unstable due to an increase of the axial flux , whose amount may possess a threshold for the existence of stable equilibria @xcite .",
    "the threshold appears to be only 10%20% of the total flux in the region . for the quiescent prominence in question",
    ", a rather modest amount of flux transfer to it through the rising fibrils may be significant enough to reach the critical point .",
    "on the other hand , the rising fibrils also input mass into the target prominence .",
    "mass loading could help hold down current - carrying flux , therefore raising the amount of free magnetic energy that can be stored in the pre - eruption configuration @xcite .",
    "thus , mass loading may also play a role in the present case , except that we do not see a significant increase in the darkness or thickness of the target prominence during the pre - eruption evolution , as reported in some cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , both darkness and thickness could be modulated by the solar rotation : the apparent darkness of the prominence in euv is expected to decrease as it rotated off the west limb , due to a ` deeper ' line - of - sight integration of euv emission in the foreground ; the thickness is affected by projection effect as the shape of the prominence is by no means symmetric along the line of sight .",
    "it is therefore difficult to determine quantitatively how much mass has been loaded as time progresses .    the torus instability @xcite sets in if a flux rope rises to a critical height @xcite at which the overlying field declines with height at a sufficiently steep rate @xcite , i.e. , the decay index @xmath23 exceeds a critical value of 1.5 , where @xmath24 is the horizontal component of the potential field external to the flux rope .",
    "however , the equilibrium of the system becomes unstable already when @xmath25 approaches @xmath26 .",
    "for example , @xcite found that @xmath26 typically falls in the range [ 1.11.3 ] for both circular and straight current channels . here",
    ", we calculate the average decay index along the filament at different altitudes using the potential - field source - surface ( pfss ) approximation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hmi ] ) .",
    "the critical height @xmath27 at @xmath28 is about 0.150.27  @xmath21 , where the filament became nominally torus unstable .",
    "the prominence indeed takes off at about 0.15  @xmath21 , according to the exponential fit (  [ subsec : height ] ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the torus instability is the major mechanism in triggering the prominence eruption . in light of flux imbalance ,",
    "the role of flux feeding is to force the prominence to seek for equilibrium at higher and higher altitudes , as evidenced by the enhanced slow - rise speed after each flux feeding episode .",
    "consequently , the prominence reached the unstable height much earlier : at the average slow - rising speed of 0.07 km  s@xmath2 prior to the flux - feeding episodes (  [ subsec : height ] ) , the filament would have reached the critical height of 0.15  @xmath21 by 23:56 ut on october 29 . in other words ,",
    "this quiescent prominence might have been quite stable without flux feeding .",
    "one can see that the prominence was embedded in a quadrupolar configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hmi ] ; the four polarities are labeled p1n1 and p2n2 ) by superimposing the line - of - sight component of the photospheric magnetic field upon the h@xmath0 image taken on 2012 october 14 when the prominence was crossing the central meridian .",
    "a small bipolar active region located to the west of the filament was composed of a leading sunspot of positive polarity ( p1 ) followed by diffused flux of negative polarity ( n1 ) . with the filament and the sunspot serving as landmarks",
    ", one can see that the ls as identified in euv observations ( figs .",
    "[ fig : orig ] and [ fig : total_erupt ] ) must be connecting n1 and p1 . during the eruptive process (  [ sec :",
    "erupt ] ) , successive surface brightenings in euv ( fig .",
    "[ fig : erupt_195 ] ) first took place between the filament and the ls ( b1 ) , then in the active region on the west , associated with the eruption of the ls ( b2 ) , and finally on the east , associated with the prominence eruption ( b3 ) .",
    "all three brightening episodes , especially b1 and b3 , were similar to two - ribbon flares in terms of both morphology and dynamics .",
    "b2 appeared to have only one ribbon ( fig .",
    "[ fig : erupt_195](d ) ) , but similar to b1 and b3 it had the moss - like appearance initially and later became the footprint of transient brighteing loops t2 below the erupting ls ( fig .",
    "[ fig : erupt_195](e ) ) .        based on these observations ,",
    "we interpret the prominence eruption on 2012 october 22 in the framework of a schematic quadrupolar configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) . both the prominence and the ls",
    "are represented by a flux rope embedded in the two side - arcades .",
    "within the two - day period prior to the eruption , multiple chromospheric fibrils rise upward and merge into the target prominence .",
    "the fibrils are apparently parallel to the target prominence and their interaction with the prominence results in horizontal flows along the prominence axis .",
    "we therefore speculate that primarily axial flux is ejected into the field of the prominence . with the accumulation of the axial flux",
    ", the prominence has to seek for equilibrium at higher heights . at certain point",
    ", it starts to interact with the flux rope embedded in the west side - arcade .",
    "the reconnection between the two flux ropes is evidenced by the first episode of two - ribbon brightening ( b1 ) underneath the central arcade .",
    "the reconnection also cuts the ` tethers ' that hold down both flux ropes , leading to their rapid rise .",
    "both rising flux ropes stretch their overlying fields and result in further reconnections underneath , which is evidenced by brightenings b2 and b3 .",
    "it is remarkable that magnetic reconnection , as demonstrated by the surface brightenings , set in almost two hours after the eruption onset (  [ subsec : height ] ) .",
    "thus , ideal instability must dominate the initial phase of the eruption , though it was later coupled to reconnection to drive the eruption .",
    "we further conjecture that being held down by dense material causes the prominence eruption to progress initially on a slower pace than the ls in the west side - arcade , as evidenced by the fact that b2 precedes b3 ; but later on , the draining of the prominence material back to the surface ( see the animation accompanying fig .",
    "[ fig : total_erupt ] ) may help the cme front resulting from the prominence eruption to catch up with the front caused by the erupting ls ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cme ] ) .",
    "however , one must be aware of the limitation of this simplified scenario : despite deviating significantly from the potential field ( fig .  [",
    "fig : hmi ] ) , the observed brightening loops ( t1 ) evolving from b1 do not connect b1 s two ribbons , which can not be explained by this 2d cartoon , but might be a reflection of the complex 3d nature of the reconnection between two flux ropes .        to conclude , we have described a new mechanism for a prominence to become torus unstable , i.e. , chromospheric fibrils that carry the helicity of the same sign as the prominence could feed flux and current into the prominence , which results in the faster quasi - static ascent of the prominence , eventually leading up to its unstableness .",
    "we have also described a new paradigm of quadrupolar eruptions , i.e. , two flux ropes embedded in the two side - arcades first interact to cut the constraining ` tethers ' , and consequently erupt in close succession and proximity , effectively manifesting as a ` twin ' eruption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
