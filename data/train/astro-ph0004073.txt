    "in the uv , as in the optical , the light which we receive from a nebula should in great part be the light of the illuminating star scattered by dust grains in the nebula . if no other process than scattering of starlight by the average population of interstellar grains is involved , the ratio of the nebula to the star spectrum depends on the optical depth of the nebula , on the angle @xmath1 of scattering , and on the albedo and phase function of interstellar grains .",
    "the original idea of this work was to study the behavior of the spectrum of nebulae in the 2200   region . in this spectral region ,",
    "the spectrum of the stars is known to have a characteristic depression ( the 2200   bump ) when there is interstellar matter between the star and the observer .",
    "the possible causes of the bump are reviewed by bless  & savage @xcite . admittedly , the bump is an extinction feature ( eventually a purely absorbing one , witt et al .",
    "@xcite ) which arises due to a particular type of interstellar grain .",
    "since a nebula placed in front of a star produces a bump in the spectrum of the star , what will the bump spectral region of a nebula illuminated by a star at close angular distance be ?",
    "if the particles which extinguish starlight at 2200   are present in the nebula , its spectrum should have an evident feature at 2200   .",
    "this feature will be an absorption one if the bump carriers are purely absorbing particles .",
    "it will be an excess of emission if the carriers scatter starlight .",
    "section [ data ] presents the iue observations used in this work .",
    "it consists of the spectrums of a few well known nebulae , all illuminated by close bright stars .",
    "section  [ analyse ] to section  [ analyse2 ] , is an analysis of the data .",
    "it is a remarkable fact , and the most significant result of this analysis , that all the nebulae have a spectrum which is exactly the product of the illuminating star spectrum and a linear function of @xmath0 ( section  [ analyse ] ) .",
    "some nebulae do not have a bump , and when they do have one it is always proportional to the bump of the illuminating star .",
    "no bump is created in the nebulae .    in section  [ int ] ,",
    "the relation between the spectrum of a nebula and the spectrum of the illuminating star is interpreted as scattering of starlight by a medium with an optical depth which varies as @xmath0 .    a second result , the power law dependence of the surface brightness on the angular distance to the star , is arrived at and discussed in sections  [ analyse2 ] and [ rdis ] .",
    "the large variations of the surface brightness level of a nebula with the distance to the star may be an important argument in favor of a strong forward scattering phase function in the uv ( section  [ rdis ] ) .",
    "it implies that a considerable amount of starlight is scattered in directions close to the star .",
    "different authors ( e.g. a.n . witt and collaborators ) have found a strong forward scattering phase function of the grains in the uv .",
    "these papers are associated with models which also predict changes of the albedo and/or the phase function with the wavelength . from analysis of the present data",
    ", i can not agree with these conclusions .",
    "contrary to these studies , i find constant albedo and phase function of the grains in all the uv , and perhaps up to the near infrared , in all directions of space . in section  [ grains ] , a few of these papers are briefly discussed along with the consequences the present paper have on the properties of interstellar grains .",

    "@xmath4-aperture observations of a star generally need to be multiplied by a factor of @xmath6 to @xmath7 to match @xmath2-aperture observations of the same star .",
    "the difference is attributed to the difficulty of holding the star within the beam when using the small aperture .",
    "observations can be made in a low resolution mode of @xmath87   or with a higher spectral resolution of 0.10.2   .",
    "three cameras : the lwr , the lwp , and the swp , have been used during the 20 year - long existence of the satellite .",
    "the swp camera covers the wavelength range [ 1150   , 1980   ] , while the lwr and the lwp cameras cover the [ 1850   , 3350   ] range .",
    "the lwr camera was the ` standard ' long wavelength camera from the beginning of the mission up until october 1983 . a problem with the camera s electronic led to a switch to the lwp .",

    "the spectrums of the same object taken with the swp camera or with one of the long wavelength range cameras usually join in the common spectral region ( @xmath819002000  ) .",
    "a slight gap between the long and the short wavelength spectrums sometimes happens and has been attributed either to a calibration problem or to a problem of precision in the pointing . in this case a correcting factor was applied to the long wavelengths range spectrum to ensure continuity from one range of wavelengths to another .",

    "when different positions of the same nebula are available and proportional , the data show that there are strong variations of the brightness with angular distance to the star but @xmath29 stays relatively constant .",
    "differences between the observed values of @xmath24 , reported in the table  [ tbl : neb ] , and its theoretical definition can arise from a mistaken evaluation of either the nebula surface brightness or the unreddened flux of the star .    a major difficulty when estimating the exact surface brightness is the width of the beam of the observations , which in many cases has dimensions comparable to the distance to the star .",
    "it should be reliable when the dimensions of the beam are small compared to the distance to the star but errors may arise when the observation is made at close distance to the star ( a few @xmath41 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the variation of the nebula surface brightness between the two ends ( facing and opposite the star ) of the @xmath2-aperture , and its orientation , have to be taken into account .",

    "the second uncertainty in the evaluation of @xmath24 comes from the radiation field .",
    "if the starlight is extinguished between the star and the scattering volume and if material in front of the star does not compensate for this extinction , the observed value of @xmath24 is superior to the exact one .",
    "conversely , if there is more extinction between the star and the observer than between the nebula and the observer , the observed value of @xmath24 will be an inflated estimate of the exact one .",
    "table  [ tbl : neb ] shows a tendency for the observed maximums of @xmath29 to increase with the reddening of the star .",
    "this increase may in part be explained by extinction of starlight in the vicinity of the star .",
    "the stars and have no bump and are slightly reddened ( @xmath43 , table  [ tbl : neb ] ) . the nebulae emissions , which have no peculiarities at 2200   , can safely be attributed to scattering .",
    "the linear transformation which permits passage from the star to the nebula spectrum is to be interpreted as the slope of the surface brightness versus the optical depth curve ( fig .",

    "[ figure-4 ]      elementary properties of scattering used in this paper are summarized by the plot of fig .",
    "[ bumpfig ] .",
    "the plot represents surface brightness variations with optical depth for a cloud illuminated by a far away source ( the source of light comes from one direction ) .",
    "the @xmath11-axis of the plot is the optical depth , related to the quantity of interstellar grains photons have crossed on their way to the telescope .",
    "the optical depth depends on wavelength and on the column density along the path the photons have followed . optical depth and column density",
    "are proportional .",
    "optical depth is a linear function of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , depending on the kind of observation which is involved , spectroscopy or photometry , @xmath68 will vary from a point to another according to the wavelength or to the quantity of matter on the photons way .",
    "the quantity of matter on the photons way depends on the angle made by the observer , the source radiation field and the nebula . only for directions close to the illuminating source",
    "can @xmath68 be assimilated to the cloud column density .",
    "the @xmath9-axis is the nebula surface brightness scaled to 1 at maximum surface brightness . at very small @xmath68 ,",
    "variations of @xmath4 and @xmath68 are proportional .",
    "absorption will quickly diminish the slope d@xmath4/d@xmath68 .",
    "@xmath4 will have a maximum at a value @xmath98 and decreases for @xmath99 .",
    "for any given column density , there is a wavelength at which @xmath98 is reached and reciprocally .",
    "hence there is a correspondence between wavelengths and column densities which allow to predict at which wavelength a cloud will preferably be observed and the possible range of column densities of a cloud bright in a certain wavelengths range .    for a constant albedo",
    ", @xmath100 should depend solely on the phase function , i.e. only on the angle @xmath1 of the source radiation field direction with the direction of the scattering volume and the observer .",
    "i thank professor y.  fukui for the support and freedom i took benefit from during two years in japan and without which this work would not have been possible .",
