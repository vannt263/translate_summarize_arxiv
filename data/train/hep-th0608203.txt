    "the quantum theory of renormalizable interactions plays the main role in our present understanding of fundamental physical laws .",
    "it gave rise to the formulation of the standard model of elementary particles which is still today in a very good shape .",
    "of course , there are many problems which have not been solved yet ( such as confinement in qcd ) : some of these problems are likely to be `` technical '' problems in the sense that a better understanding of the actual standard theory should be enough to give the correct solutions .",
    "as far as other problems ( such as the hierarchy problem , the cosmological constant , the quantum version of the gravitational interaction and so on ) are concerned , the standard theory is likely to be inadequate . in particular ,",
    "the lacking of a precise understanding of non perturbative phenomena occurring in the strongly coupled phase of gravity ( which should clarify important and still poorly understood features of early cosmology ) is unpleasant : being gravity perturbatively non renormalizable , it is not possible to make detailed predictions in such a phase .",
    "the two main candidates to be the final theory of quantum gravity , _ superstring theory _ and _ loop quantum gravity _",
    "( which are not necessarily to be thought as mutually exclusive ) , still are too complicated to be fully understood . thus , it is worth to explore new ways in which `` physical effects beyond the standard model '' could be already manifest in the low energy ( low with respect to the planck scale ) physics .",
    "the dominant point of view of string theorists is to see the einstein - hilbert action as an effective action in which the `` heavy degrees of freedom '' have been integrated out .",
    "unfortunately , in order to make this idea predictive and to clarify how it is possible to improve in practice the uv behavior of gravity it would be important to understand in more details the dynamics of such degrees of freedom and , at the present stage , this is a rather difficult task .",
    "it is not enough to say that \" gravity is an effective field theory : even if this is the case , to perform meaningful computations in the strongly coupled regime with the technical tools at our disposal ( perturbative expansions of various kind , renormalization group and so on ) , physical effects beyond the standard model  ( related , for instance , to string theory ) which enable such a meaningful ( and , hopefully , predictive ) computations still have to be clarified . to be more specific ,",
    "string theory predicts various type of geometrical corrections to the bare  einstein - hilbert action : @xmath0where @xmath1 is the einstein - hilbert action , @xmath2 is the string length and the @xmath3 are higher order curvature invariants .",
    "even if a large but finite number of terms are added , the corrected action remains non renormalizable and , consequently , it is not yet clear how to perform meaningful quantum computations ( unless one would be able to sum the whole series : a hopeless task indeed ) . in a sense ,",
    "the analysis of the @xmath4 corrections as a tool to shed light on non perturbative phenomena in gravity is like the analysis of the standard perturbation expansion in qcd to understand confinement .",
    "clearly , in qcd , there is a little hope to understand non perturbative phenomena with ordinary perturbation theory . in the same way , in gravity one should expect physics beyond the standard model to manifest itself in a different , perhaps more subtle , way .",
    "renormalizability is not a mere aesthetic requirement ; it is , in fact , the need to have a theory which is predictive in the strongly coupled phase : one should expect ( it is better to say hope ) that physics beyond the standard model will improve the einstein - hilbert gravity precisely in this direction .",
    "a sound theoretical idea which could give important indications on the way to follow is the _ holographic principle _ introduced in su95,th93 ( for two detailed reviews see @xcite ) which is at the basis of the string - theoretical ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite  a large * n * expansion for the gravitational interaction has been formulated which shed new light on the relations between higher spins , the holographic principle and non perturbative phenomena such as ( a sort of ) gravitational confinement . in * * su(n)**__gauge theory _ _ , the large * n * expansion introduced by t hooft in @xcite and refined by veneziano @xcite is indeed one of the most powerful non perturbative techniques available to investigate the strongly coupled phase ( it provides the issues of _ confinement _ , _ chiral symmetry breaking _ and the relation with _ string theory _ with a rather detailed understanding ; a clear analysis of the role of baryons at large",
    "* n * has been given in @xcite : see , for two detailed pedagogical reviews , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main properties of the large * n * expansion is that many non trivial models ( such as the @xmath5 @xmath6 model in five space - time dimension and the gross - neveu model in three space - time dimensions which are not renormalizable in the standard perturbative expansion ) become in fact renormalizable ( see , for example , @xcite ) : the green functions are not anymore analytic in the small coupling constant region ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the large * n * expansion can be seen as a strong coupling expansion which , besides to clarify non perturbative phenomena such as _ confinement _ and _ chiral symmetry breaking _ , greatly improve the uv behavior of theories which , at a first glance , would appear meaningless at high energies . here , it will be argued that , under very reasonable assumptions , this could also happen in gravity .",
    "the large * n * expansion suggests suitable resummations of planar diagrams which lead to an uv - softening of gravity : the relation between the newton constant and the mass of higher spin field(s ) seems to be quite similar to the relation between the fermi coupling constant and the mass of the @xmath7 bosons of the electro - weak interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the diagrammatic formulation of general relativity as a constrained bf theory is shortly described and the well known result about the perturbative non renormalizability of gravity is described in this formalism . in section 3 ,",
    "the large * n * resummations which improve the uv behavior of gravity are introduced : for the sake of clarity , in section 3 the complications connected to ghosts will be neglected keeping manifest , however , the main physical features leading to the uv softening . in section 4 ,",
    "the ghosts effects which could prevent the uv softening are analyzed . in section 5 , a possible physical interpretation of the large * n * uv softening",
    "is proposed and the connections with the klt relations equation are pointed out . eventually , the conclusions are drawn .",
    "in this section the bf formulation of gravity  and the corresponding feynman rules will be shortly described .",

    "for the sake of clarity , it will be firstly presented a simplified version of the argument ( in which , however , the main physical ideas are manifest ) leading to the uv improvement . in the next section , the effects of ghosts in the loops will be discussed .",

    "this miracle  happens in the following way : many diverging diagrams in the standard perturbative expansion ( which are of different order in the standard coupling constant @xmath88 ) are , in fact , of the same order in @xmath95 : this fact tells that such diagrams should be summed together ( such a resummation is easy being a geometric series ) . the difference with respect",

    "indeed , the introduction of @xmath41 and of the yang - mills  term is not a mere avoidable technical complication : it is in fact the more transparent way to identify the guilty  vertex and to cure it by the means of the large * n * expansion .",
    "it will be now discussed a possible interpretation of the previous results in terms of a sort of gravitational confinement ( in which the gravitational color , that is the spin , is confined ) which should be dual , in the sense of the gauge / gravity correspondence ( see , for two detailed reviews , ber03,di05 ) to the standard gauge theoretical confinement .    in many other cases , such as the @xmath84 scalar ( in five space - time dimensions ) and fermionic ( in three space - time dimensions ) models with quartic interactions , the seemingly magic  properties of the large * n * resummations are , in fact , related in a very simple way to physical properties of the models . in the above mentioned cases , the large * n * expansion is able to explore the strongly coupled phase of the theory in which phenomena such as the appearance of color - less  bound states in the spectrum , spontaneous breaking of symmetries and so on occur . thus , a natural question is : which is the phenomenon behind the improvement of the uv behavior of gravity at large",
    "* n * ? in the present formulation of the gravitational action matter fields should be described as scalar fields living in suitable representation of the internal gauge group according to their spin @xcite . at large",
    "* n * , in the strongly coupled phase of gravity ( as it is also suggested by the gauge / gravity correspondence ) , the physical spectrum should be dominated by colorless bound states . in this",
    "context colorless particles simply means scalar particles which , therefore , should dominate the spectrum in the uv region . gravitational confinement",
    "would dramatically improve the renormalizability of the theory .",
    "the reason is that , if the gravitational interaction confines at the planck scale , one is left with only scalar fields at high energy : this would soften the uv behavior of the theory .",
    "this can be seen forgetting for a moment the present formalism ( in which the spin of particles is represented by an internal index in a suitable representation of the internal gauge group ) and returning to the standard space - timeinterpretation of spinful particles .",
    "the contribution to the scattering amplitude @xmath141 in the @xmath142channel ( where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are mandelstam variables ) at high energies of a particles with spin equal to @xmath13 is roughly @xmath145 @xmath146 being the mass of the particle and @xmath45 being a suitable coupling constant .",
    "when @xmath147 , loops integrals in which such a spin @xmath13 particle appears are convergent ; when @xmath148 there are logarithmic divergences ( which , in case , can be renormalized ) and when @xmath149 there are non renormalizable divergences .",
    "this fact is behind the perturbative non renormalizability of einstein - hilbert action .",
    "in fact , if there is a critical energy scale , beyond which only scalars are left in the spectrum due to the gravitational confinement , the above problems are naturally solved by the dynamics of the gravitational field : thus , the gravitational interaction could be non perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "it is worth to note that the main responsible for the good uv properties of gravity at large",
    "* n * is , presumably , a sort of gravitational confinement . on the other hand , in gauge theories ,",
    "suitable order parameters for confinement are the wilson loops .",
    "therefore , one should expect that the gravitational analogue of the wilson loops should play a fundamental role in understanding the strongly coupled phase of gravity .",
    "interestingly enough , such operators have been introduced in @xcite in the context of the ashtekar formalism for gravity @xcite ( for an updated review , see as04 ) .",
    "thus , it is apparent an intriguing relation between loop quantum gravity and the present large * n * expansion for gravity .",
    "this is a good point to think at the following question : what would be the physical meaning of renormalizability at large",
    "as far as the standard perturbative expansion is concerned , a pragmatic answer is that a given theory ( without local symmetries ) is renormalizable ( in the standard feynman expansion ) when the number of primitive divergent feynman diagrams is finite .",
    "this issue can be dealt with by looking at the uv behavior of bare propagators and vertices ( on which the standard perturbative expansion is based ) .",
    "the deep physical meaning of such a property is manifest in the wilson point of view ( to discuss the wilson view in a gravitational context is far beyond the scope of this paper ) . as far as the present scheme is concerned , it is enough to say that an uv renormalizable theory is a theory which allows meaningful and predictive computations ( in the uv ) because the fields appearing in the lagrangian are suitable to describe the uv phase . when this does not happen , there are two possibilities : either the theory is wrong or the uv degrees of freedom are non trivial non local combinations of the ones appearing in the lagrangian .",
    "thus , a pragmatic answer to the question on the physical meaning of renormalizability at large * * n * * could be the following : a theory which is uv renormalizable at large",
    "* n * ( and is not uv renormalizable in the standard perturbative expansion such as the gross - neveu model in 3 dimensions or the @xmath6 model in 5 dimensions @xcite ) is a theory which is formulated in terms of fields not suitable to describe the uv phase .",
    "however , it is not wrong : the large * n * recipe tells how to sum class of diagrams of the standard expansion in order to obtain a meaningful expansion ( with a finite number of primitive superficially divergent diagrams ) . in the already mentioned examples , this has a very precise meaning : in the uv phase new degrees of freedom appear which are bound states of the original fields ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "this is exactly the picture which seems to emerge from the present scheme : scalar bound states which soften the uv behavior of amplitudes of particles carrying spin 2 or greater .",
    "however , as it will be discussed in a moment , in gravity there is the further complication of local symmetries : one should also prove that local symmetries are preserved by the large * n * resummations .",
    "it is worth to mention here an interesting relation ( which is worth to be further investigated ) with the so called _ klt _ relations @xcite .",
    "klt _ relations were first obtained in a string theoretical framework : they allow to express closed string amplitudes in terms open string amplitudes .",
    "schematically , the factorization of the vertex operators @xmath150(where the @xmath151s are vertex operators of the closed string , open string left modes and right modes ) is related to the results in @xcite stating that correlations of vertex operators factorize at the level of integrands ( that is , before the world sheet integrations are performed ) .",
    "kawai , lewellen and tye were able to proof a stronger result : the complete closed string amplitudes factorize into products of open string amplitudes even after the world sheet integrations .",
    "indeed , the _ klt _ relations go well beyond string theory itself : they imply , for instance , in the low energy limit highly non trivial relations among tree amplitudes of gravity in four dimensions which factorize ( in suitable non linear gauges ) into gauge theoretical tree amplitudes in four dimensions .",
    "these results have been generalized to include loops by using unitarity relations ( for a pedagogical review see @xcite ) , however it is not available yet a complete proof of these very useful factorizations results . usually , one deals with the klt relations in the standard metric formalism in which , having in mind small deviations from a flat metric @xmath152the basic variable is the metric fluctuation @xmath153 . in the standard metric formulation of gravity",
    "the structure of the many vertices present in the theory is very complicatet . to fully exploit the klt relations one needs to choose a gauge in which , roughly speaking",
    ", the right index and the left index of @xmath153 are never contracted with eachothers ( otherwise no `` left - right '' factorization @xmath154would be apparent have to be thought as the `` gluons '' of the gauge theory responsible of the factorization of the gravitational amplitudes ( the plus and minus signs refer to the elicities ) . ] ) .",
    "such ( non linear ) gauge choices are highly non trivial and the many vertices of the theory in the metric formalism sometimes obscure the physical origin behind the klt relations . in the present framework",
    "such features are rather manifest : in particular , the presence of a lagrange multiplier field @xmath136  which , in the double line notation , is represented by four internal lines leads directly to amplitudes fulfilling the generalized klt relations .",
    "the reason is that in the bf formulation of gravity the propagators and vertices can be chosen to be equal to the propagators and vertices appearing in the bf formulation of yang - mills theory : the only , crucial , difference is the higher spin lagrange multiplier field .",
    "such a field gives rise , quite generically , to gravitational amplitudes which manifestly are factorized into pieces in which only `` ym fields '' ( that is , fields which are also present in the bf yang - mills lagrangian ) appear ( see , for instance , fig.[9 ] ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath155  `` allows '' to attach amplitudes of the bf yang - mills theory to obtain amplitudes of the bf formulation of gravity : for this reason , the present scheme seems to be suitable to fully exploit and , hopefully , to establish in general the klt relations .",
    "vertex ( which is disconnected from the `` internal lines '' point of view ) in explaining such important relations between gravity and gauge theory ( which , in the bf formalism , are distinguished precisely by the above mentioned 4-uple @xmath42 vertex ) . ]",
    "in this paper an analysis of renormalizability of gravity at large * n * expansion for general relativity has been carried on .",
    "it is based on the bf formulation of general relativity in which the einstein - hilbert action is splitted into a topological term plus a constraint .",
    "it has been shown that the large * n * expansion dictates resummations of a suitable class of planar diagrams which lead to a great improvement of the uv behavior of gravity : only a finite number of superficially divergent diagrams are present at large * n*. this is an important step in proving renormalizability .",
    "the next steps are the analysis of the infinities and their fulfilment of the symmetry constraints such as the slavnov - taylor identities and the zinn - justin equation .",
