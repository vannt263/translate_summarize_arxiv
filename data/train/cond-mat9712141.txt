    "more recently , several detailed studies have been made of the ideal system of nonrelativistic charged bosons , both numerically @xcite , and from a theoretical point of view in both two @xcite , and three @xcite dimensions .",
    "also a detailed study of the boson gas in three dimensions with trapping harmonic potentials and the presence of a magnetic field has recently been made using the path  integral formalism @xcite .",
    "these authors find comparable behavior to that found using mellin transforms , and a comparison between the two methods is very instructive .",

    "the specific heat was calculated numerically as well as analytically , for small values of the magnetic field .",
    "we also performed calculations of the magnetization and showed how the effective action method could be used to account for the condensate when @xmath2 .",
    "one motivation for our study was to understand in more detail the behavior of the magnetized gas for @xmath4 .",
    "when a magnetic field is present , no matter how small , there is no phase transition ; however when there is no magnetic field the system does exhibit a phase transition with a non  zero condensate . on physical grounds",
    "we would expect that there should be some sense in which the system in a small magnetic field should behave in almost the same way as the free gas . by examining the specific heat it is possible to see that as the magnetic field is reduced , the curves start to resemble the specific heat for the free gas .",
    "so long as the magnetic field remains non  zero the specific heat is always smooth , with the specific heat maximum approaching the the free bose gas transition temperature as the magnetic field is reduced .",
    "the results of section [ sec : meb ] may be used to study this analytically . although we did not show it , it is straightforward to show that the derivative of the specific heat becomes discontinuous as @xmath5 , exactly as in the case for the free bose gas .",
    "similar remarks apply to gases in other dimensions .",
    "we also studied the behavior in large magnetic fields .",
    "here we found that the specific heat for a gas in @xmath0 spatial dimensions looked like the specific heat for the free gas in @xmath3 spatial dimensions over a range of temperatures .",
    "once the temperature gets too large this effective reduction in dimension disappears .    by using the mellin ",
    "barnes integral transform we were able to obtain a number of analytical approximations .",
    "although , for @xmath2 , it is not possible to solve for the critical temperature exactly , it is possible to obtain good estimates when the magnetic field is weak .",
    "these approximations can then be used to study the meissner ",
    "ochsenfeld effect .",
    "we were also able to obtain reliable approximations for the first time valid at the free gas condensation temperature .",
    "as a by  product our calculations showed exactly how the chemical potential vanishes as @xmath5 .",
    "the most obvious way that the calculations given in this paper should be extended is by the inclusion of coulomb interactions among the charged particles .",
    "clearly this is essential before it will be possible to study bose ",
    "einstein condensation of charged particles in a reliable way .",
    "given the recent experimental advances in the cooling and trapping of atomic gases , it may become increasingly important to study this problem for trapped ions .",
    "a less pressing extension of our work is to relativistic charged particles .",
