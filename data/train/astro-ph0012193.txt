    "one can easily show that the bulk of opacity , @xmath0 , must originate in clouds of low column density , @xmath9 @xcite ; in other words , the gunn - peterson effect probes the lowest density region of the universe , and most of its volume .",

    "they found that the high opacity regions require a diffuse gas component and a large value of @xmath17 . in turn , this result implied that the uv background has a soft spectrum , with a softness parameter , @xmath18 , where the @xmath19 are the uv background photoionization rates for and , respectively .",
    "they also tested different hypotheses to explain a prominent opacity gap at @xmath20 and argued that it most likely arises in a region where helium is doubly ionized by a discrete local source , quite possibly an agn .",

    "@xcite interpret theses observations as evidence that re - ionization of has not yet taken place , being _ delayed _ relative to re - ionization .",

    "in order to improve our understanding of the gunn - peterson effect shown in the _ hst _ stis spectra of , we also require good spectra covering the ly-@xmath1 forest . in this section",
    ", we describe the _ hst _ stis and keck  hires observations of this object .",
    "we obtained the stis observations of in november 1998 during the course of two `` visits '' , each five orbits long ( program 7575 ) .",
    "the observations used the g140 m grating which produced a spectrum covering the wavelength interval 11451200   .",
    "the combined 10 exposures led to a total exposure time of 29,000s .",
    "the spectra have a resolution of 0.16   fwhm , equivalent to 3 `` lo - res '' pixels @xcite .",
    "the corresponding resolving power is @xmath24 .",
    "the observations were reduced at the goddard space flight center with the stis investigation definition team ( idt ) version of calstis @xcite , which allowed us to make a customized treatment of the background . such flexibility is needed in order to ensure accurate fluxes and opacities in the gunn - peterson trough .",
    "the detector background in a stis g140 m observation is highly non - uniform , with a large `` hot - spot '' of dark counts which increases in amplitude with increasing detector temperature ( see e.g. fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the qso spectrum intersects this hot - spot roughly through the middle .",
    "because of the non - uniformity of the background and the variation of its level from exposure to exposure , we decided to reduce and combine the spectra following the optimal extraction algorithm detailed by @xcite .",
    "this method led to a significant improvement of the final s / n because it provides optimal weights to individual spectra , so that those extracted from high dark current exposures contribute proportionally less than those with low background .",
    "the only deviation from the @xcite algorithm involves the estimation of the background in each exposure , for which we used the following method .",
    "two 50pixel wide zones were defined above and below the qso spectrum , both offset by 11 pixels from it .",
    "the mean intensity of the 50 pixels of each column of each zone was calculated , after pixels whose intensities were significantly discordant were discarded .",
    "this operation produced two independent spectra representing noisy estimates of the sky plus dark background .",
    "much smoother versions of these backgrounds were then obtained by fitting them with a cubic spline function of 15 equally spaced nodes using a non - linear least squares method @xcite .",
    "the mean value of the fits to the two backgrounds provided us with the final estimate of the sum of the sky and dark backgrounds .    in  [ sec : results ] , we will present very low residual fluxes : averaged over typically 5  , they correspond to values of the order of @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "it is thus important to verify that we are indeed able to measure such low flux values . in particular",
    ", we must make sure that the determination of the background near the spectrum is not affected by systematic effects .",
    "therefore , we checked the above routines on dark exposures obtained over a period of 6 months centered on the date of the observations .",
    "the temperatures of the detector at the epochs these darks were obtained had a range similar to those of our observations of .",
    "we found that the routines described above consistently allowed us to determine zero residual fluxes within the estimated measurement errors .",
    "the other steps of the reduction process exactly follow the algorithms described in @xcite . the bottom panel of fig . [",
    "fig : comparison_stis_hires ] shows the final spectrum , normalized to the continuum flux of the qso , assumed to be a constant whose value is determined in  [ sec : continuum ] .",
    "the keck  hires spectrum was obtained in one keck i telescope run in 1997 , october 1 - 3 , and is the sum of 10 , 40-minute exposures , 5 in each of two echelle settings to give complete wavelength coverage , which leads to considerable overlap in the center of the echelle format .",
    "the @xmath27 slit was employed resulting in a resolving power @xmath28 .",
    "the metal - line systems in this spectrum were included in a recent analysis of high @xmath14 metal - line ratios in the ly-@xmath1 forest @xcite , which also contains a general description of the data taking and reduction procedures .",
    "the wavelengths in the final spectrum are vacuum heliocentric .",
    "the normalized spectrum is presented in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_stis_hires ] .    for each line @xmath29 in the hires spectrum",
    ", the column density @xmath30 and doppler parameter @xmath31 were evaluated using fitlyman @xcite .",

    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the stis spectrum of shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_stis_hires ] . for purposes of description",
    ", this spectrum can be divided into three regions : _ ( 1 ) _ the region redward of @xmath32 , which we use to determine the continuum flux of the qso ; _ ( 2 ) _ the region covered by a complex @xmath33 absorption system @xcite at the location where the spectrum should be affected by the ` proximity effect ' ; _ ( 3 ) _ the region affected by the gunn - peterson effect .",
    "we now examine the main characteristics of each of these regions .      for a given object , measuring the opacity in the gunn - peterson trough mainly depends on the throughput of the telescope and the absence of systematic effects at low fluxes , which we demonstrate in the previous section .",
    "it also requires a good estimate of the underlying continuum . in the absence of published data blueward of the stis spectrum , our only means to estimate",
    "the continuum level is to extrapolate the behavior of the spectral region redward of @xmath34 towards the blue .",
    "however , we must also make sure that a possible emission line does not lead to a local increase in the flux in that spectral range .",
    "@xcite measured the redshift of to be @xmath35 from the observed wavelength of the @xmath36 emission line . since the systemic velocity of the ly-@xmath1 emission line has never been measured to our knowledge , we can estimate the expected range of its observed wavelength from the systemic velocities of other emission lines in the keck  hires spectrum .",
    "we find that the velocities of the emission line peaks relative to their expected location for @xmath37 are bracketed by the emission line , which is blueshifted by @xmath38 , and the emission line , which is redshifted by @xmath39 ",
    "however , we note that the emission line may be affected by a broad absorption line , so that its peak may appear at a wavelength longer than its intrinsic location .",
    "the peak of the emission line is therefore expected to lie at @xmath40 , well within the spectral range covered by the @xmath41 absorption system .",
    "given this and the fact that the emission line is weak in the spectra of @xcite and @xcite , we are confident that the measurement of the continuum redwards of @xmath42 is little affected by the emission line .",
    "redward of 1187  , the spectrum presents a continuum spectrum interrupted most notably by a pair of galactic @xmath43 doublets ( at heliocentric velocities @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) , as well as some weak absorption lines , most probably ly-@xmath46 lines corresponding to low-@xmath14 ly-@xmath1 lines .",
    "away from these absorption lines , the spectrum appears very flat ( in @xmath47 ) , with a mean flux of @xmath48 , measured in the spectral regions defined by @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "comparison with the ghrs spectrum obtained by @xcite indicates that the quasar flux was @xmath51 25% lower during our observations than it was in june 1996 . for completeness",
    ", we note that the galactic reddening towards is very low , @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "( this value is less than half the one used by @xcite , i.e. @xmath53 , which was inferred from the column density measurement by @xcite . ) assuming @xmath54 and a mean milky way extinction law given by the analytical expression of @xcite , the mean flux corrected from galactic extinction in the wavelength range @xmath55   is therefore @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , the extinction varies only by @xmath57 over the whole range covered by the stis spectrum .",
    "examination of the fos and ghrs spectra presented by @xcite indicates that the gunn - peterson trough is just blueward of the recovery zone of the continuous absorption by 2 lyman limit systems at a mean redshift @xmath58 .",
    "more precisely , they measure the optical depth at the lyman limit to be @xmath59 , which implies that the continuum absorption changes by less than 1% in the wavelength range covered by our stis spectrum . unfortunately , despite this , existing data do not allow a reliable determination of the underlying , ` true ' , unabsorbed quasar continuum slope due to their relatively low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "therefore , we performed a linear fit to our stis data in the wavelength ranges @xmath60 and @xmath61 , apparently devoid of absorption lines .",
    "we find that a flat continuum ( in @xmath47 ) is compatible with our data . in the following",
    ", we have therefore assumed that the continuum is indeed flat .",
    "the corresponding normalized spectrum is presented in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_stis_hires ] .",
    "however , the error on the slope is such that extrapolating the result to 1145 at the bluest range of our spectrum indicates that it may underestimate the true value by at most 10% at that wavelength and proportionally smaller at longer wavelengths .",
    "we obtain a similar result using the lower signal - to - noise ghrs spectrum fitted over additional spectral ranges redwards of 1200   .",
    "consequently , the mean normalized flux measured below (  [ sec : high_opacity ] and table [ tab : opacity ] ) could be over - estimated by at most @xmath62% , so that the opacities in the large opacity regions , which we are mainly interested in , could be under - estimated by at most 0.1 .",
    "therefore , as stated earlier , our ability to measure high opacity depends mainly on the low systematic errors in the background level made possible by stis , whereas the continuum definition is less critical .",
    "observations of the ly-@xmath1 forest reveal that the number and column densities of lines decrease close to the redshift of the background quasar .",
    "this effect , known as the proximity effect , is most probably due to an increase in the ionizing radiation intensity close to the quasar ( cf . * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "a similar effect is expected in , which should be easily seen in the spectra of bright qsos . indeed , from eq . 4 in @xcite",
    ", we would expect that the proximity profile would extend over more than @xmath63  a large portion of the stis spectrum  since the luminosity of is @xmath64 at the lyman limit .",
    "however , @xcite found that the spectrum shows no evidence for a proximity effect . instead , the ghrs and the stis spectra reveal regions of high opacity near the redshift of the quasar . at the corresponding wavelengths in the keck spectrum ,",
    "a series of interesting , , and absorption lines can be seen .",
    "more surprisingly , the and especially lines present evidence of `` line  locking'' ( smette & songaila , in preparation ) , i.e. , the velocity separation between two different components of the complex appear equal to the velocity separation between the two components of the doublet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this effect results from radiation pressure and can only be produced by material located physically close to the region responsible for the qso continuum .",
    "the ghrs and the stis spectra therefore suggest that absorption from this @xmath65 system is also present in .",
    "@xcite suggested that the absence of the proximity effect in is actually due to the presence of this @xmath66 system .",
    "the large column density @xmath67 required to explain the observed opacity in the @xmath68 complex in the ghrs and stis spectra also implies a large continuum opacity .",
    "consequently , the number of ionizing photons effectively escaping from the background quasar is reduced by a large amount . a conservative way to estimate the continuum opacity",
    "can be made .",
    "first , we assume that the gas has a ` box - car ' velocity dispersion . in this case , a lower limit to the column density distribution can be obtained by measuring the effective opacity @xmath69 in a trough of the @xmath70 system . here , @xmath71 is the mean normalized flux in the spectral range of interest .",
    "we find that in the range @xmath72 , @xmath73",
    ". therefore , we can infer that @xmath74 . as a lower limit to the opacity at the lyman - limit",
    "is actually given by @xmath75 itself , the transmitted flux at the lyman - limit escaping from the clouds causing the @xmath66 system is certainly less than 2% of the continuum flux .",
    "this value is sufficient to reduce the size of the proximity profile to @xmath76 .",
    "since the @xmath77 system is better represented by a complex of lines , we can reasonably assume that the column density is larger than the value given above , reducing further the size of the proximity profile .",
    "therefore , we can confirm that the presence of @xmath78 complex in the spectrum of is likely to cause the absence of a proximity effect . in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we discuss the potential impact of such systems on the general uv background .",
    "the presence of the @xmath79 absorption systems makes it difficult to determine exactly the highest redshift for which the intergalactic background radiation is the only influence of the ionization fraction .",
    "the two lowest redshift doublets that appear to be mutually line - locked are at @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we thus suggest that the maximal redshift to be considered for the study of the gunn - peterson effect is @xmath82 ( corresponding to @xmath83 for ly-@xmath1 ) , slightly lower than the value @xmath84 chosen by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we measure the mean normalized flux @xmath71 and its standard deviation @xmath85 in different spectral ranges of the spectrum .",
    "table [ tab : opacity ] lists the wavelengths used to define these ranges as well as the corresponding values of @xmath71 and @xmath85 .",
    "these values are also graphically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : normalized_spectrum ] .",
    "table [ tab : opacity ] also lists the inferred gunn - peterson opacities @xmath86 , and their corresponding 1 sigma upper and lower limits . if @xmath71 is negative , the reported lower limit to @xmath0 is @xmath87 . as discovered by @xcite , the gunn - peterson spectrum has regions of high and low opacities .    at this stage , it is interesting to note that the region @xmath2 in the spectrum of @xcite covers the range @xmath88 , as the whole stis spectrum of .",
    "although the spectrum of is noisy in that region , it shows a relatively constant flux and no opacity gap .",
    "a value @xmath89 was inferred , which is much smaller than the opacity measured at higher redshift towards the same object and also the opacity measured in most regions ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) in the spectrum of .",
    "@xcite noted this apparent sharp decrease in gunn - peterson opacity below @xmath95 along the line of sight towards but suggested that , indeed , it may not be representative of other lines of sight . a possible cause for the low opacity of the region @xmath2 in the spectrum of in presented in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "spectral range @xmath91 in the spectrum of is of special interest because of its high opacity , @xmath96 , even though the region in the corresponding spectrum shows a large spectral range with no absorption lines .",
    "we will show in  [ sec : model ] that this spectral range is even more peculiar than the comparable dobrzycki - bechtold void seen in , for which a large opacity in is measured despite a dearth of large column density lines .",
    "the opacity gaps at @xmath97 and 2.866 ( called  voids  by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) extend over 13 and 7 comoving mpc and the minimal values of their opacity are 0.44 and 0.07 , respectively .",
    "the latter opacity gap seems associated with an absorption system at @xmath98 located at a velocity @xmath99 blueward of it .",
    "it shows at @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "it also shows with a  relatively large  total column density of @xmath104 and a narrow doppler @xmath105 parameter of 16   @xmath106 , so that the logarithm of the column density ratio @xmath107 indicates a large ionization parameter .",
    "the total @xmath108 .",
    "the suggestion by @xcite that systems are associated with opacity gaps is therefore strengthened . however , we note that no absorption system is present within @xmath109 of the opacity gap at the lower redshift @xmath110 .    in figure",

    "the two curves bracket the opacities of all the models calculated by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the measured opacities are much larger than predicted .",
    "as concluded also by @xcite , we will argue later that these simulations use a model of the uv background radiation that is much too hard .",
    "in this section , we present a method that aims at providing the value of the softness parameter @xmath2 of the ionizing radiation , defined as the ratio of the to photoionization rates , @xmath111 as a function of redshift .",
    "we prefer this definition to another one given by the ratios of the uv background intensities at the and lyman limits , @xmath112 , as eq .",
    "[ eq : softness_parameter ] accounts for the shape of the uv background spectrum .",
    "therefore , we can actually build a one - dimensional map of the fluctuations of the softness parameter as a function of redshift along the line of sight to the background quasar studied , in this case , . in practice",
    ", the resulting map provides the softness parameter for the different spectral ranges defined above (  [ sec : high_opacity ] ) , which correspond to a redshift interval comparable to the mean redshift separation between any two @xmath113 lyman forest lines .",
    "such a map can be compared with the values from other observations , as , for example , the to ratio ( cf . ",
    "[ sec : fluctuations_siiv_civ ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that such a map is very model - independent , in the sense that we make no hypothesis on the origin of the softness parameter at a given redshift .",
    "we leave such interpretation to  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the following method , as well as the models described later in  [ sec : model ] , assumes that clouds at @xmath8 are in photoionization equilibrium , with hydrogen mostly ionized and helium mostly doubly ionized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "as in @xcite , we use a ` combined ' line list , which is a merger of the observed line list ( cf . ",

    "note however that the derived values for the softness parameter are likely to be underestimated .",
    "indeed , even if only weak or no corresponding lines can be seen , a large opacity usually suggests that the gas density is not especially small compared to other regions .",
    "instead , it probably indicates that the photoionization rate is larger in that region .",
    "therefore , the neutral fraction in is probably smaller for the clouds observed in that region compared to the mean ly-@xmath1 forest at the same redshift . since our ` simulated ' line list is based on the mean characteristics of the ly-@xmath1 forest at the given redshift , they constitute a set of lines caused by clouds with a mean value of the neutral fraction . consequently this method is not self - consistent .",

    "the mean number density of lines at a given column density in the ` simulated ' line list is expected to be smaller in a region where the large photoionization rate is larger than in the mean ly-@xmath1 forest , as it is the case in the ` observed ' line list .",

    "over which the mean normalized flux @xmath134 , we used an upward arrow representing a 1 @xmath4 lower limit @xmath135 ; its bottom line represents the softness parameter corresponding to a mean normalized flux equal to @xmath136 .",
    "the only spectral ranges where a hard ionizing radiation is required , with @xmath2 lower than @xmath137 , are the two opacity gaps . otherwise , it is clearly apparent from fig . [",

    "the stellar contribution is fixed at 912  to have an emissivity twice that of the quasars and is considerably softer than the model of @xcite or other models without a significant stellar contribution .",
    "this model of fardal et al . has @xmath139 and was found to be consistent with the observed opacity on the line of sight towards @xcite , even in the dobrzycki - bechtold void region which presents a low number density of ly-@xmath1 lines .",

    "alternatively , the large softness parameters could be due to delayed re - ionization , as advocated by @xcite . in this case",
    ", the corresponding regions have yet to be suject to a large amount of ionizing photons , so that the photo - ionizing rate is small .",
    "we will further discuss these two models in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "in any case , we are led to the conclusion that the shape of the uv background spectrum at a given redshift can be quite different from the ` canonical ' uv background dominated by the quasar population .",

    "there is no occurrence of such a large spectral range with such low opacity in the spectrum of before @xmath260 .",
    "another way to express this observation is that there is no line with @xmath261 over this spectral range . from table 4 of @xcite ,",
    "the column density distribution at a mean redshift @xmath262 is @xmath263 .",
    "therefore , we expect to see @xmath264 lines with @xmath265 per unit redshift , or about 4 such lines over a spectral range of 6.5 at @xmath266 . for a poisson distribution ,",
    "the _ a posteriori _ probability that no such lines are seen is @xmath267 .",
    "an additional argument in favor of the soft sources model come from the recent study by @xcite : by comparing the / vs the / ratio over the range @xmath268 with cloudy models , they find that the data are best explained by a uv background dominated by qsos at low redshift but that a dominating stellar contribution is progressively required at higher redshift .    finally , we should note that in the absence of soft sources , within the delayed reionization model , the high opacity in regions @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 puts constraints either on the the lifetime or the luminosity of the agn causing the opacity gaps .",
    "indeed , let us suppose that the opacity gap at @xmath269 is indeed caused by an agn whose characteristics are close to the values given in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "therefore , the large opacity in regions @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 indicates at least one of the two following conclusions :    _ ( i ) _ let us assume that there are no high column density systems ( including systems intrinsic to the agn ) on the light path between the agn ( located off the line - of - sight ) and regions @xmath90 to @xmath92 and that the time that was required to photo - ionize the region @xmath270 , @xmath271 , is similar to the time required to photo - ionize the regions @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the difference between the lifetime of the agn , @xmath272 , and @xmath271 is larger than the time required for light to go from the agn to region @xmath270 but smaller than the time required to go from the agn to any of the regions @xmath90 , @xmath91 and , _ a fortiori _ , @xmath92 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath273 , compatible with currently admitted agn lifetime .    _",
    "( ii ) _ in unification scheme models , the agn continuum region may be surrounded by a molecular torus optically thick to both and ionizing photons . in this case , the model that we have developed would require to take into account more variables .",
    "indeed , the size and shape of the opacity gaps will not only be determined by the luminosities and impact parameters of the responsible agn but also by the orientation of the ionizing radiation cone relative to the line of sight towards .",
    "of course , the possible configurations are numerous .",
    "however , it is interesting to consider the possibility that the ionizing cones are oriented perpendicularly to the line of sight towards as this configuration allows to derive lower limits to the agn luminosities .",
    "in the case of the @xmath274 opacity gap , region @xmath270 alone would see the continuum region while the torus blocks ionizing photons to reach regions @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and therefore would explain their high opacity in the absence of other hard sources . since region @xmath270 extends over @xmath275 comoving mpc , and assuming a half - opening angle of @xmath276 deg @xcite , we derive an impact parameter of @xmath277 comoving mpc for the agn . since this value is only slightly larger ( 50% ) than the impact parameter we found above ( cf . table [ tab : parameters ] ) , the luminosity of the agn should be at least of the same order of magnitude as listed in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "we can do the same exercise for the @xmath278 opacity gap .",
    "the comoving distance between its extremities ( broadly taken to be from 1157.75 to 1162 , although residual signals are detected at the 3@xmath4 levels in regions @xmath238 and @xmath279 ) is @xmath280 comoving mpc .",
    "therefore , the impact parameter would be @xmath281 comoving mpc , also about 50% larger than the value listed in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "consequently , we find that for two models of agn ( with and without optically thick molecular torus ) , table [ tab : parameters ] lists at least lower limits to their luminosities .    in summary , there is no clear explanation for the high opacity seen in the spectrum of , especially in regions @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "tests based on the width of the lines are inconclusive mainly because of the small number of lines available . within the delayed reionization model",
    ", we can provide some constraints on the lifetime , compatible with currently admitted values , or lower limits to the luminosity of the agn causing the opacity gaps .",
    "however , the large region of low opacity is more easily explained in the soft sources model .",
    "consequently , a search for @xmath282 lyman break galaxies in this field would be interesting in order to test the soft sources model , while a search for agn with _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ could indicate the presence of a molecular torus .      in the previous sections , we only considered photoionization as the main process responsible for the different features seen in the spectra of . in @xcite , we also examined two alternative explanations to the opacity gaps , as arising in low - density regions or caused by shock - heated gas , and we will not consider them any further .",
    "we only note that the 5 lines that appear within the opacity gaps have a @xmath283 , which is consistent with the values derived in other parts of the spectrum ( cf . above ) . in other words ,",
    "the temperature within the opacity gaps does not seem to be significantly different from regions of high opacity .",
    "instead , we can wonder if photoionization is the only explanation for the high opacity seen in the spectral ranges @xmath91 and @xmath92 where few lines are seen .",
    "clearly , such regions are not affected by low gas density , since it would be difficult to explain the large opacity .",
    "can collisions ionize the without ionizing ?",
    "if this was the case , we would expect that the gas be warmer in regions where collisional ionization is the most important process .",
    "therefore , we would expect that the doppler @xmath105 parameter of the lines in these regions to be significantly larger than elsewhere . in the previous section",
    ", we already compared the @xmath105 parameter of the lines in regions @xmath91 and @xmath92 to the ones in other regions and found no significant difference in the median value of the two samples . within the limits of validity of this test ,",
    "mainly due to the small sample of lines , we conclude that there is no indication that collisional ionization is responsible for the small line number density in regions @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "finally , it could also be that part of the observed opacity in region @xmath91 and @xmath92 is actually due partially to metal absorption lines associated either with the milky way or with intervening systems .",
    "however , existing spectra at longer wavelengths do not reveal any strong systems at the appropriate redshifts .",
    "similarly , we do not expect any strong galactic lines at @xmath284 .",
    "in this paper , we have presented _ hst _ stis spectra of .",
    "the brightness of the quasar permits the use of the g140 m grating which provides a much improved resolution ( 0.16  ) compared to the data obtained by @xcite ( 0.7  ) with the ghrs .",
    "the 2 dimensional nature of the fuv mama detector allowed us to better quantify the background due to the sky and ( mainly ) the dark current .",
    "we confirm the findings by @xcite that the spectrum presents regions of high opacity , some of them devoid of corresponding lines , and regions of low opacities ( opacity gaps ) that match regions displaying a low number density of lines .",
    "we improve significantly the lower limits on the gunn - peterson opacity in the high opacity regions .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath285 in region @xmath91 .",
    "even at the lowest redshift recorded by the stis spectrum , the opacity is still @xmath286 .",
    "this value is significantly larger than the value of 1.9 measured by @xcite in the spectral range @xmath2 of the spectrum of with a redshift range comparable to the stis spectrum of .",
    "another interesting feature is the absence of the proximity effect already noticed by @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that the large column density required to account for the large opacity in the spectral region affected by the @xmath65 absorption also implies that the amount of ionizing photons escaping is reduced to a very small quantity .",
    "it is interesting to speculate on the effects of such systems on the uv background radiation . of the 4 objects for which the gunn - peterson absorption has been observed ,",
    "only two show the proximity effect ( and ) .",
    "the other two ( and ) also show strong @xmath78 systems , with evidence of line locking ( cf . * ? ? ? * for hs  1700 + 6416 and smette & songaila , in preparation , for he  2347 - 4342 ) , which indicates that the absorption takes place close to the quasar continuum emitting region .",
    "if these 4 quasars are representative of the quasar population as a whole  which is probably not the case , as @xcite and @xcite ) find a dependence of the number of @xmath68 systems in quasar samples either on their radio - loudness or both their radio - loudness and optical luminosity  then one can expect that only half of the ionizing photons escape from the known quasar population relative to the case where all quasars emit ionizing photons .",
    "consequently , we would expect that the photoionization rate be reduced by a significant factor in models where the uv background radiation is dominated by quasars , leading naturally to a softer uv background .",
    "another expected consequence of the fact that only a fraction of the qsos actually provide ionizing photons is that the uv background photoionization rate should show stronger fluctuations than predicted by current models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since even fewer quasars would contribute to the ionizing flux at a given point .",
    "comparison between the and the spectra allowed us to build a one - dimensional map of the softness of the uv background radiation . except in the opacity gaps ,",
    "the observed uv background is significantly softer than model predictions assuming a qso - dominated uv background ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in spectral ranges @xmath91 and @xmath92 , it is even larger than the one predicted for a uv background whose intensity at 1 rd has equal contributions from stars and agn ( cf .",
    "* for some examples ) .",
    "large values of the softness parameters are in agreement with the large observed to ratios seen in quasar absorption line systems .    we have presented a simple model to describe the opacity gaps caused by photoionization due to ` hard ' sources located close to the line of sight to the background quasar . away from individual absorption lines , it indicates that the extent of the gap is related to the source luminosity , while , for a given extent , the amount of transmitted flux at the center of the gap is directly related to the distance of the source to the line of sight .",
    "finally , we have expanded the model of the gunn - peterson trough presented in @xcite to account for multiple sources close to the line of sight .",
    "it allows us to make relatively precise predictions concerning the intrinsic luminosity of the sources causing the opacity gaps , which should be easily detectable with _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton_.",
    "we discussed the possible origin of the regions of high opacity but low opacity .",
    "we introduce a new model where they are caused by nearby soft sources",
    ". if only a small number of these sources are present close to the line of sight , they should be bright and easily observable .",
    "however , we have few constraints on their number so that they could be much fainter and more numerous , with a space density comparable with the lyman break galaxies .",
    "we compare this model with the delayed re - ioniation scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "there is no clear argument which leads us to favor of one or the other model to explain the high opacity in these regions . within the delayed re - ionization model ,",
    "if opacity gaps are indeed caused by agn , the presence of a high opacity region close to an opacity gap provide reasonable constraints on the lifetime or luminosities of the agn . on the other hand",
    ", soft sources would more easily explain the large region of low opacity seen at the same redshift as region @xmath91 .",
    "optical search for lyman break galaxies and x - ray observations can probably settle the issue .",
    "while this paper was being revised , @xcite presented _ fuse _ observations of the line of sight towards , covering a much longer redshift range ( @xmath287 ) and twice higher resolution ( @xmath288 ) than our _ hst _ stis observations .",
    "however , over the common wavelength range , our data show a larger signal - to - noise ratio and especially better controlled systematic errors ( mainly due to the better background determination made possible by the the stis fuv - mama detector compared to the _ fuse _ ones ) , that allow us to provide better contraints on the gunn - peterson optical depth .",
    "the behavior seen in the _ hst _ ghrs and stis observations , i.e. , alternance of regions of low and high opacity is confirmed and seen over the whole spectral range covered by the _ fuse _ observations . in the _ fuse _ spectrum , the optical depths measured over spectral ranges of @xmath289 appear to converge towards theoretically predicted values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath290 but are systematically larger than predictions in the redshift range common to both _ fuse _ and stis observations .",
    "comparison between the _ fuse _ observations and the corresponding keck  hires spectrum shows that @xmath291 varies between @xmath292 to at least several hundreds , as in the stis spectral range . in accord with the findings of this paper ,",
    "@xcite conclude that these regions of large @xmath114 ( or softness parameter @xmath293 ) are subject to a much softer background radiation either because of delayed re - ionization or due to the presence of ` soft ' sources close to the line - of - sight .",
    "although both explanations are equally possible over some spectral range , the fact that excursions of @xmath114 towards large values continue to @xmath294 probably favour the latter one .    we thank joop schaye , mark fardal and gerry kriss for discussions .",
