    "randomly branched polymers ( rbps ) are a classical topic in statistical physics .",
    "seminal advancements in the theoretical understanding of these polymers  @xcite have been made not long after the advent of renormalization group theory starting with the seminal work of lubensky and issacson ( li ) . with the surge of biophysics ,",
    "there recently has been renewed interest in rbps because rna in its molten phase belongs to the same universality class as swollen rbps  @xcite . however , the current understanding of rbps is still not quite satisfactory .",
    "for example , the topology of their phase diagram is not entirely clear . in particular the part of the phase diagram that contains",
    "the so - called @xmath1-transition gives reason for debate .",
    "the existing theories  @xcite for the collapse @xmath0-transition are not entirely correct .",
    "as far as we know , there exist no theories for the transport properties and the related fractal dimensions of rbps such as the dimensions of the backbone , the shortest path and so on .",
    "in this paper we are not interested in chemical or mechanical properties of randomly branched polymers .",
    "rather , we are interested in their structure . more precisely , we are interested in their universal structural properties in the limit where the number of constituent monomers is large . in this limit",
    ", an rbp can be regarded as a large cluster , and its structural properties are universal , i.e. , common to large rbps as a class irrespective of their physical or chemical details .",
    "phenomenologically , only their large size and their branching on all length scales are relevant . in the language of critical phenomena",
    " phenomena with large correlation lengths , here the diameters of clusters  all such systems of fractal clusters with different microscopic aspects but with these common relevant properties belong to one universality class , which we denote in the following with the _ pars pro toto _ randomly branched polymers . in computer simulations such clusters",
    "are usually constructed as so - called lattice animals , i.e. , clusters of connected sites ( monomers ) on a @xmath2-dimensional regular lattice .",
    "the recent publication of hsu and grassberger on the collapse transition of animals @xcite and the unresolved issues mentioned above have triggered us to reconsider this classical topic with field theoretic methods .    in the much - studied case of a single large linear polymer in a diluted solvent ,",
    "the phase diagram is one - dimensional .",
    "when the solvent quality is lowered ( typically by lowering its temperature ) below the so - called @xmath0-point , the polymer undergoes a collapse transition from a swollen coil - like conformation to a compact globule - like conformation . in simple lattice models , the monomer - solvent repulsion that drives the collapse transition",
    "is generically implemented via an effective attractive interaction between non - bonded monomers which is equivalent to the monomer - solvent repulsion at least as far as universal properties are concerned .",
    "thus , the fugacity for non - bonded monomer - monomer contacts , let s call it @xmath3 , can be chosen as the control variable spanning the phase diagram of a linear polymer in a solvent . evidently , @xmath3 is closely related to temperature .    in the case of a single large rbp in a diluted solvent ,",
    "the phase diagram is two - dimensional , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] .",
    "the basic reason for the additional dimension is that one has to deal with an additional fugacity stemming from the fact that the number of bonds @xmath4 of an rbp is not uniquely determined by its number of sites @xmath5 , @xmath6 , whereas it is uniquely determined for a linear polymer ( as well as for a tree - like branched polymer ) with @xmath7 .",
    "the additional fugacity , let s call it @xmath8 , regulates thencyclomatic index ( the number of cycles @xmath9 ) of the polymer in the grand partition sum .",
    "for @xmath10 , the rbp has no cycles and the minimal number of bonds , i.e. , it is tree - like . the phase diagram becomes one - dimensional ( it reduces to the vertical axis with @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] ) .",
    "physically , @xmath8 can be varied , e.g. , by adding polyfunctional chemical units to the solution whose insertion into rbp results in additional bond cycles .    over the last two decades or so",
    ", a number of numerical studies have been undertaken to map out this phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the picture that arises from these studies can be summarized as follows : there is a swollen phase where the polymer is in a tree - like or sponge - like conformation and a compact phase , where the polymer is in a coil - like or vesicle - like conformation .",
    "there is some debate , whether there exists a phase transition between the two compact conformations or not . between the swollen and the compact phases ,",
    "there is a line of collapse transitions .",
    "one part , called the @xmath0-line ( labelled collapse , blue ) , corresponds to continuous transitions with universal critical exponents from the tree - like conformation to the coil - like confirmation .",
    "the other part of the transition line , called the @xmath12-line ( red , in the dashed region ) , corresponds to the transition between the foam- or sponge - like conformation to the to vesicle - like conformation . between the @xmath0- and @xmath12-lines",
    "there is a tricritical point .",
    "there has been some controversy , if the @xmath12 transition is continuous or not . with",
    "the assumption of it being continuous , computer simulations in 2 dimensions yield nonuniversal critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "as we will explain in detail below , our rg study shows that the collapse transition to the right of the tricritical point is characterized by a runaway of the rg flow .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath1-transition is a fluctuation induced first order transition instead .",
    "it could also mean that two of the lines observed in numerical studies of the phase diagram , viz .",
    "the lines interpreted as the line of transitions between two compact phases and the @xmath1-line , respectively , are merely shadows of the spinodals of the discontinuous transition .",
    "is the fugacity for contacts between non - bonded monomers , and @xmath8 is the fugacity for closed monomer cycles on the polymer.,width=245 ]    the most fruitful theoretical approach to rbps is based on the asymmetric potts model @xcite although flory theory @xcite and real space renormalization @xcite have also been applied successfully . for the swollen phase",
    ", the field theoretic problem was settled by parisi and sourlas ( ps ) via mapping the relevant part of the asymmetric potts model to the yang - lee edge problem using dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "subsequently , this mapping has been applied to further problems such as the exact calculation of universal scaling functions characterizing the behavior in the physical dimension 3 @xcite .",
    "dimensional reduction was confirmed later with the discovery of an exact relationship between swollen rbp - models and repulsive gases at negative activity in two fewer dimensions by brydges and imbrie @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric potts model also provides a vantage point for studying the @xmath0-transition and is the basis of the seminal field theoretic work of li @xcite and harris and lubensky @xcite .",
    "their @xmath13-loop calculation for the @xmath0-transition , however , contains a systematic error in the rg procedure , and as a consequence their long - standing @xmath13-loop results for the collapse transition are strictly speaking not correct although the numerical deviation from the correct results is fortunately small .",
    "very recently , we developed a new dynamical field theory for rbps , see  @xcite for a brief account . in the present paper , we extend our work , and we present it in more detail to make it easier accessible for non - specialist readers .",
    "our theory is based on a stochastic epidemic process which models especially dynamical percolation with a tricritical instability @xcite . as we will discuss in detail below",
    ", we focus entirely on the the non - percolating phase of the process . there , the very large clusters that finally result have the same statistics as rbps @xcite .",
    "the tricritical instability of the process , in particular , gives us a handle on the statistics of collapsing rbps .",
    "we discuss the relation of our model to the asymmetric potts model and carefully analyze its symmetries . in the swollen phase",
    ", the model has a high super - symmetry including translation and rotation invariance in super - space and leads to the well known parisi",
    " sourlas dimensional reduction @xcite . at the collapse transition",
    ", super - rotation symmetry is lost , and only translation invariance in superspace , i.e. , becchi  rouet ",
    "stora ( brs ) symmetry  @xcite , is restituted at the fixed point of the renormalization group .",
    "the appearance of brs - symmetry shows that only tree - like rbps @xcite are relevant also at the collapse transition .",
    "we perform a 2-loop renormalization group ( rg ) calculation , that corrects and extends the long standing li results for the collapse transition .",
    "furthermore , we show that the @xmath1-transition is characterized by a runaway of the rg flow which suggests that this transition is a fluctuation induced first order transition contrary to what has been assumed in recent numerical studies @xcite .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelling ] , we derive our dynamical field theoretical model starting from the langevin equation for a generalization of the so - called general epidemic process ( gep ) .",
    "we discuss different limits of this model and recast it into different forms to reveal the symmetry contents and to establish the connections to previous work in particular that of li and ps . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rencoltran ] we present the core of our rg analysis with focus on the @xmath0-transition .",
    "we define our rg scheme and we set up rg equations .",
    "we analyze the rg flow and its fixed points , and we point out the implication of this flow for the @xmath14-transition . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rbpobservables ] , we extract from our rg results for various observables common in polymer physics . in particular ,",
    "we calculate scaling forms and critical exponents for the @xmath0-transition.we also present results for the fractal dimension of the minimal path on rbps at the collapse transition and in the swollen phase . at the collapse transition , in particular",
    ", this fractal dimension determines several other fractal properties since large rbps are effectively tree - like . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concludingremarks ] , we give a few concluding remarks .",
    "there are three appendixes that present some additional information and some of the more technical aspects of our study .",
    "in this section we develop our model for rbps based on the gep which is perhaps the most widely studied reaction diffusion process in the universality class of dynamical isotropic percolation . to be more specific",
    ", we use a generalization of this process that allows for a tricritical instability .",
    "we will start out with the langevin equation for this generalized gep which we will refine into a minimal model in the sense of renormalized field theory .",
    "for background on field theory methods in general , we refer to  @xcite . for background on dynamical field theory in the context of percolation problems ,",
    "we refer to  @xcite . for a related approach to the somewhat simpler problem of directed randomly branched polymers ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "usually , one models rbps by means of so - called lattice animals which are nothing but clusters of connected sites on a regular lattice .",
    "one considers as the primary quantity the number @xmath15 of all different configurations ( up to translations ) of a single cluster ( animal ) which is a collection of @xmath5 sites , connected by @xmath16 bonds , @xmath9 cycles of the bonds , and @xmath17 contacts ( nearest - neighbor pairs of non - bonded sites ) .",
    "the number of occupied bonds is then given by @xmath18 .",
    "there is no need for introducing a separate number @xmath19 of nearest - neighbor pairs of occupied and non - occupied sites .",
    "this number is given by the relation @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the lattice coordination number , which is equal to @xmath22 on a simple hypercubic lattice .",
    "the weighted animal number @xmath23 represents a general partition sum for the system .",
    "if one sets @xmath24 to zero , the sum only includes tree configurations .",
    "it is well known that this partition function , also known as the generating function of lattice animals , can be obtained from the asymmetric @xmath25-state potts model in the limit @xmath26 @xcite , and it is this connection , that stands behind the seminal earlier results on rbps , cf .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .    typically , one considers the partition sum for large animals : @xmath27 .",
    "the phase diagram in this limit in terms of the fugacities @xmath24 and @xmath28 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : phasedia ] .",
    "the special curve @xmath29 , parametrized by a bond - probability @xmath30 as @xmath31 , @xmath32 defines a bond - percolation model with the percolation probability @xmath33 depending on the specific type of the lattice . in general ,",
    "if @xmath27 , there is a swollen phase for small fugacities , and a compact phase separated by the collapse transition line @xmath34 which consists of two parts separated by the percolation point as a higher order critical point .",
    "whereas in the swollen phase @xmath35 with universal @xmath36 and non - universal @xmath37 , one finds at least for the left part of the transition line the scaling law @xmath38 with non - universal @xmath39 , and universal @xmath0 in general different from @xmath36 @xcite . the percolation point as a separating point on the transition line with higher order critical behavior has a @xmath40 which is in general different from @xmath0 and @xmath36 . only in mean - field theory ( landau approximation ) these exponents are equal : @xmath41 .",
    "other fundamental quantities are given by correlations of sites on the cluster .",
    "the correlation function may be defined by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total number of clusters with @xmath5 sites , @xmath9 loops , and @xmath17 contacts , containing the lattice sites @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "of course it is @xmath46 the radius of gyration @xmath47 is then defined by @xmath48 for @xmath27 , it shows also an universal scaling law @xmath49 the fractal dimension @xmath50 is different at the transition line from its value in the swollen phase and at the separating percolation point .",
    "however , in mean - field theory it has the uniform value @xmath51 .",
    "of course , in the compact phase , the fractal dimension is always equal to the lattice dimension @xmath2 .",
    "the model that we are about to develop is in the spirit of landau s ideas for modeling second - order phase transitions , i.e. , it is a mesoscopic model that focuses on general principles unifying processes belonging to the same universality class and is therefore necessarily phenomenological @xcite . to set the stage ,",
    "however , we find it worthwhile to discuss in some detail a specific model belonging to the rbp universality class , viz .  a generalization of the gep .",
    "the reaction - diffusion equations defining this process will nurture our intuition and will help us to establish our ideas .    the following generalization of the gep is a variant of a process that we have introduced for the description of tricritical isotropic percolation @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath52 an agent , i.e. , an infected individual , at site @xmath44 .",
    "an agent can infect a neighboring site @xmath53 via the percolation step @xmath54 this fundamental reaction gives rise to spreading and branching of the epidemic .",
    "the agents can spontaneously become immune ( or decay ) and produce spam as a marker of the agent through the reactions    @xmath55    where @xmath56 denotes an immune individual or spam at site @xmath44 . in the language of forest fires ,",
    "the @xmath56 are also referred to as debris .",
    "it is the debris left behind by the epidemic that forms the clusters which serve us as prototypes for rbps .",
    "their self - avoidance or excluded volume interaction is modelled with help of the reaction @xmath57 where @xmath58 , which dampens the epidemic .",
    "a mechanism for the rbps to compactify is introduced into the process through the reaction @xmath59 which simulates an effective attraction of the agents by the debris .",
    "having these reactions , one possible way to proceed would be to reformulate the corresponding master - equation in terms of bosonic creation and annihilation operators and then to produce a field theoretic action from these operators via coherent state path integrals @xcite .",
    "however , we prefer to extract directly the mesoscopic langevin equations that incorporate the universal features of the above reactions , namely the percolation of agents , their spontaneous decay , their suppression and possible effective attraction by the debris , and the possible existence of vacua without agents as absorbing states of the system .    the primary density - fields describing our generalized gep are the field of agents @xmath60 and the field of the inactive debris @xmath61 which ultimately forms the polymer cluster .",
