    "in the search for by direct detection in the laboratory , spectacular levels of background reduction have been achieved . in the `` commissioning run '' of the cresst ii , for example ,",
    "the rate of posssibly interesting events was reported as 0.063 per kg - day @xcite , based on three events . for the about 600 gm of sensitive material used in the analysis",
    ", this corresponds to less than one event per week .",
    "similarly , the cdms collaboration , after various cuts , had no events for 121 kg- days of germanium data @xcite .",
    "edelweiss discusses four events on the basis of 322 kg - days @xcite .",
    "and most recently xenon100 , with 48 kg for 100 days , reports only three events @xcite .    with such low event rates even rare sources of background must be considered .",
    "in particular the most worrisome background in underground experiments searching for through nuclear recoils are neutron - induced nuclear recoils .",
    "neutrons scatter off nuclei and the recoils could closely resemble the sought - for signal . furthermore as we shall explain below , fast neutrons , which are difficult to shield , will give elastic nuclear recoils with the same general as expected in the searches . although estimates of from standard sources such as incoming muons or radioactivity in the surrounding rock ( see the above references and for example @xcite ) give  fluxes which are quite small , the very good level of background suppression being reached implies that even very rare processes or perhaps unexpected contaminations must be considered .",
    "while there are elaborate monte - carlo program sets for carrying out standard background calculations , it must be said that they are not very transparent , and do not offer much insight into the nature of the effects under consideration .",
    "hence it may be useful to have a discussion based on a simple physical picture , even if this is only semi - quantitatively accurate .",
    "estimates generally lead to neutron sprectra dominated by low .",
    "such fluxes can be strongly reduced by shields .",
    "however such shields are typically hydrocarbon materials , which while very effective at low , become rapidly ineffective at higher .",
    "thus the pdg tables @xcite give the rather large value of 88 cm for the nuclear interaction length in polyethylene , and for example in a monte carlo study with a lead - hydrocarbon shield @xcite the authors remark that this `` provides effective shielding only for below 10 mev '' .",
    "thus there is a possibly significant question of `` fast '' or `` higher ''",
    ". it may therefore be useful if we present some simple remarks about the effects to be anticipated from them in s and perhaps other low background setups .",
    "we can do this in a simple and general way terms using the ` black disc ' model which , for fast , approximately applies for all nuclei . while this can only be regarded as a semi - quantative approximation , it offers a simple and general overwiew of the situation .",
    "unfortunately , even such an rough discussion is not possible for slow .    we should stress that we use the terms `` fast '' or `` high '' in the sense of physics , that is to mean s of a few mev and above , and of course not in the sense of high physics",
    "above a few mev -nucleus begins to resemble the  black disc \" limit . while at lower the behavior of the is dominated by resonances and shows a complicated structure which varies from nucleus to nucleus , at the higher a smooth behavior with respect to sets in , one which can approximately be described by the ",
    "black discmodel .",
    "this model in its simplest form only involves one parameter , namely r , the radius of the nucleus .",
    "this permits a simple description , applicable to all target nuclei , adequate for our purposes of semi - quantative background estimates .    in fig[o16tot ] ,",
    "fig[ca40tot ] , and fig[w184tot ] @xcite we show as examples the total experimental for the light , medium , and heavy weight nuclei oxygen , calcium , and tungsten .",
    "one notes that just above the resonance region the total becomes smooth and tends to be above the black disc value , ( indicated by the grey line using r as given by eq[rnuc ] ) and then slowly descend through it as the increases .    in the elastic",
    "there is a forward diffraction peak at low momentum transfer @xmath1 .",
    "this elastic is concentrated in a region characterized by r~1 , where r is the radius of the nucleus . at the same time",
    "there is an inelastic of about the same magnitude . in the perfect `` black disc ''",
    "limit the elastic and inelastic cross sections are equal and of magnitude @xmath2 .",
    "as we shall discuss below , this inelastic could in principle be used as a signal for the presence of the fast .",
    "the principle features of the simple ` black disc ' model result from the assumption that the nucleus is totally absorbing for up to impact parameter @xmath3 , beyond which there is no or absorbtion .",
    "this simple assumption has the following consequences : 1 ) the total is made up of equal elastic and inelastic parts , adding up to @xmath4 , 2 ) these features are independent 3 ) the form of the elastic versus angle or momentum transfer is given by a simple bessel function expression , ( see eq[rexp ] ) where in particular the form versus momentum transfer is independent of the .    as one sees in the examples of fig[o16tot ] , fig[ca40tot ] , and fig[w184tot ] the where the smooth ` optical model ' behavior sets in varies with the target nucleus . for oxygen",
    "the must be above about 10 mev , for calcium above 4 or 5 mev , while for tungsten 1 mev suffices .",
    "one also notes from the plots that with our value for r the total is somewhat underestimated , particularly at the lower .",
    "there is a large literature concerning more sophisticated treatments of the optical model @xcite .",
    "there the simple ` black ' assumption is replaced by a partial and dependent transparency , the ` hard edge ' is softened , modifying the simple radius assumption , and resonance effects and variation with nucleus may be included .",
    "while all these points are interesting and important they will not significantly alter our general conclusions , particularly our main point , as to be discussed in section [ recen ] that the recoil implied by the optical model and characterized by our parameter @xmath0 are in the region anticipated for searches .",
    "it is interesting that if we put eq[del ] in the formula for the recoil @xmath5",
    "e_r=~ , one gets recoils in the region of interest for many searches .",
    "@xmath6 is the mass of the nucleus , @xmath7 and for r we use r = a^1/31.4f .    calling this typical recoil",
    "@xmath8 one obtains ( @xmath9 units ) e_r^o= = mev .",
    "this is the typical characterizing the elastic of the `` high '' . in table 1",
    "we show the value of @xmath8 for some nuclei .",
    "the numbers run through the values often considered in searches .",
    "the differential is a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath10 , and with these definitions we can write ( r)^2= .",
    "the introduction of the dimensionless variable @xmath11 , where @xmath12 allows us to describe , within the limitations of the model , all nuclei in a universal way in terms of their @xmath13 .",
    "a second interesting point is that in the model this typical recoil for the `` high ''   depends on the nucleus _ but not _ on the of the .",
    "this implies that the whole of the `` high ''  spectrum contributes in approximately the same way to the recoils .",
    "this statement is only strictly true insofar as the black disc model is exactly valid , but it will be seen that the major features of the model hold approximately over a wide range of .",
    "[ tab ]    .the quantities @xmath3 , @xmath8 for various nuclei with mass number a. [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     eq[elba ] may be used to estimate the event rate in an acceptance window for a given setup and an assumed flux .",
    "bessel function relations can be used to estimate what fraction of the elastic @xmath2 is in a certain interval .",
    "thus , for example , assume a @xmath14 accepting events on the oxygen between 10kev and 40kev .",
    "from table 1 this correspopnds to @xmath15 between 0.11 and 0.42 . on the other hand",
    "the total elastic according to eq[elba ] is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "now there is the `` orthonormality relation '' @xcite @xmath17 , where we have normalized as in eq[lox ] . according to eq[lox ] one",
    "may take @xmath18 as approximately equal to one in this interval .",
    "thus we have a fraction of the elastic @xmath19 in the interval 10kev to 40kev .",
    "since @xmath20 , there is thus a of 0.030 b in the interval .    for a flux of say @xmath21 for the `` high '' , this leads to a rate of @xmath22/kgday for @xmath14 .",
    "some information on underground fluxes may be found in reference @xcite .",
    "naturally given the flux at a given location , the must be further be propagated through the shielding and materials of the setup in question , and there is the further question of originating in these materials .",
    "an important difference between and wimps is of course that are strongly interacting and wimps weakly interacting .",
    "this implies that , depending on the material and geometry of the , multiple may serve as a signal for s.    a further significant difference between the mev  we discuss here and the assumed galactic wimps is the low of the wimp .",
    "the wimp is expected to have a small velocity , typical of objects in the milky way , @xmath23 ( c=1 units ) .",
    "then even , say , a mass 50 gev wimp only has an @xmath24 , and a ` light wimp ' with m=10 gev only @xmath25 .",
    "such are generally not enough to induce significant inelastic processes on most nuclei .",
    "on the other hand , with mevs and above typically have many inelastic reations and the inelastic reactions are expected at close to the same rate as the elastic . in the ` black disc '",
    "limit one has @xmath26 .",
    "fig[o16el ] @xcite for the elastic on oxygen , when compared with fig[o16tot ] , shows this is approximately true .    in experiments with",
    "two - signal readout designed to distinguish electromagnetic backgrounds from nuclear events , such as cresst , edelweiss , cdms , xenon .. .",
    "these inelastic events will typically appear as a high signal in the nuclear event band .",
    "depending on the nuclei in question , the most common inelastic channels will be nuclear excitation , leading to a @xmath27 ray , or nuclear breakup . in breakup",
    "common nuclear fragments are further and @xmath28 , while for nuclear excitation followed by @xmath27 rays electromagnetic is present .",
    "therefore inelastic events will generally have a relatively high deposit , compared to the elastic recoils either from wimps or .",
    "depending on the nuclei present in the , these inelastic events could also appear on nuclei other than those exhibiting the small recoils .",
    "thus associated with a fast   flux there should be a characteristic set of events with quite different properties from the small elastic recoils .",
    "but these should be absent for wimps .",
    "we have pointed out that the difficult - to - shield fast s will give elastic nuclear recoils of the same type as sought for in searches .",
    "we explain , however , that it should be possible to use evidence internal to the in establishing the presence of a background and so not to be only dependent upon standard assumptions and monte carlo estimates .",
    "we have suggested some methods of doing this , including the pattern of recoil , the rates on different nuclei through the periodic table ( see section 4 ) and the presence of inelastic nuclear processes at about the same level as elastic nuclear recoils ( see section 5 ) . in this respect",
    "it is thus desirable to have systems able to distinguish more than one type of recoiling nucleus @xcite .",
    "for light to medium weight nuclei the induced events should show a rather flat spectrum with respect to recoil @xmath5 . at a fixed recoil ,",
    "the variation of the rate with respect to changing the nucleus is different for and wimps as explained in connection with table3 .",
    "neutrons can of course have multiple interactions , and fast as opposed to wimps can induce inelastic reactions , and at a relatively high rate .",
    "the great difficulty , as with all aspects of searches , is that at present only a handful of events is available and that a detailed investigation of these points requires extensive data , not easy to come by in very low rate experiments .",
    "i would like to thank f. proebst and j. schmaler for many discussions on this subject .",
