    "single - peakedness is one of the most important and commonly examined domain restrictions on preferences .",
    "the study of single - peaked preferences in computational social choice is often restricted to total orders , but in practical settings voters often have some degree of indifference in their preferences .",
    "this is readily seen in the widely available preference datasets in preflib , which contains several large datasets comprised of voters with partial preferences , many of which are weak orders  @xcite .",
    "some election systems are even explicitly defined for weak orders , e.g. , the kemeny rule  @xcite .",
    "single - peaked preferences model the preferences of a collection of voters with respect to a one - dimensional axis  @xcite .",
    "each voter in a single - peaked electorate has a single most preferred candidate ( their peak ) on the axis and candidates further to the left or right from their peak with respect to the axis are less preferred .",
    "this models an election with a single polarizing issue where candidates representing the two extremes would appear on the leftmost and rightmost locations on the axis .",
    "single - plateaued preferences model the preferences of a collection of voters in a similar way , but allow voters to have multiple most preferred candidates  @xcite .",
    "elections where the voters have single - peaked preferences over the candidates have many desirable properties .",
    "for example , when the voters in an election have single - peaked ( or even _ nearly _ single - peaked ) preferences the complexity of determining if a manipulative action exists often becomes easy  @xcite and determining the winner for dodgson and kemeny elections becomes easy  @xcite when it is @xmath1-complete in general  @xcite .    the first paper to computationally study the single - peaked consistency for partial preferences was lackner  , where a partial order is said to be single - peaked with respect to an axis @xmath2 if it can be extended to a total order that is single - peaked with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "for clarity we refer to this as existentially single - peaked , or , throughout this paper .",
    "lackner presents algorithms and complexity results for determining the single - peaked consistency for preference profiles of varying degrees of partial preference , including top orders , weak orders , local weak orders , and partial orders in his model  @xcite .",
    "lackner   shows that if a given preference profile contains an implicitly specified total order , which is not guaranteed to exist , then  consistency for weak orders and the general case of  consistency for top orders ( weak orders with all indifferent candidates ranked last ) are both in @xmath0 .",
    "the complexity of the general case of determining the  consistency for weak orders is explicitly left as the main open problem in lackner   and we show that it is in @xmath0 . we show that an algorithm to determine if a 0 - 1 matrix has the property of consecutive ones in rows , previously used to determine the single - peaked consistency for total orders by bartholdi and trick   and the single - crossing consistency for total orders by bredereck et al .   can be used to determine the single - peaked consistency , single - plateaued consistency , and  consistency for weak orders _ without _ an implicitly specified total order .",
    "so given a preference profile of weak orders not only can we determine if it is single - peaked , single - plateaued , or , we can find all consistent axes through the use of the pq - tree algorithm for the consecutive - ones matrix problem  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we define the types of partial preference studied , state definitions for the different variants of single - peakedness , and define the consecutive - ones matrix problem .",
    "our results are split into three different sections each one corresponding to a different variant of single - peakedness .",
    "specifically section  [ sec : extsp ] for  preferences , section  [ sec : splat ] for single - plateaued preferences , and section  [ sec : sp ] for single - peaked preferences . in each of these sections",
    "we redefine the variant of single - peakedness using forbidden substructures and describe the transformation from its consistency problem to the problem of determining if a 0 - 1 matrix has the property of consecutive ones in rows . in section  [ sec : related ] we discuss related work that considers single - peakedness and partial preferences .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] by summarizing our results and stating some possible directions for further study .",
