    "the field of neutrino physics is developing rapidly after atmospheric neutrino oscillations and solar neutrino oscillations have been established @xcite .",
    "recently , sk collaboration has found an evidence for the oscillatory signature in atmospheric neutrinos , improving the determination of @xmath5 @xcite , and k2k experiment has confirmed the neutrino oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos at the 99.99% cl @xcite .",
    "these neutrino experiments measure the energy and angle of muons produced in neutrino - nucleus interactions and obtain the incident neutrino energy that determines the neutrino oscillations .",
    "k2k takes data at @xmath6=0.53 gev region , and the recent l / e analysis of the sk atmospheric neutrinos is based on the dataset mainly from 0.5 to 25 gev .",
    "jparc and numi neutrino experiments @xcite propose to measure @xmath7 oscillations and to determine @xmath8 at @xmath9 level of the precision and @xmath10 above 0.006 , using a narrow - band neutrino beam at @xmath11 gev ( jparc ) and 2.0 gev ( numi , off - axis ) .",
    "it is thus vital that theoretical calculations of the cross sections and spectra could be carried out with a similar reliability . for this , both of neutrino - nucleus reactions and relevant nuclear structure have to be well under control . at @xmath6=3 gev or less , quasi - elastic scattering and quasi - free @xmath2 production dominates the neutrino - nucleus reactions .",
    "the reactions at this energy region are associated with a wide range of the momentum transfer and thus involve various aspects of nuclear structure . because the momentum transfer involved is large enough that nuclear correlations are important as the relevant nuclear structure beyond a mean - field description .",
    "furthermore , the neutrino - nucleus reactions do occur , in fact rather appreciably , with a small momentum transfer , and requires a careful treatment of nuclear properties and reactions , as observed in the deficit of events in the low @xmath12 region @xcite , compared to what is expected based on a fermi gas model .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the aspects of effects of nuclear correlations . using the same formalism , we study both of electron and neutrino quasi - elastic scattering in the energy range of 0.5 and 1.5 gev . for numerical calculations ,",
    "we mostly take @xmath0o as it is the main target nucleus in sk , k2k , and other experiments .",
    "we calculate the cross sections of electron-@xmath0o quasi - elastic scattering and quasi - free @xmath2 production , using a relativistic plane - wave - impulse approximation ( pwia ) formalism @xcite with a uniform fermi - gas model and a spectral function @xcite , and compare with @xmath3 data , so as to examine the validity of the calculation .",
    "the pwia neglects final - state interactions , but we will estimate their effects using simple formalisms . following the electron scattering",
    ", we examine neutrino-@xmath0o scattering to see how the effects observed in the electron scattering manifest in the neutrino scattering .",
    "electron - nucleus quasi - elastic cross section is expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the incident electron energy , @xmath15 the mass of the target nucleus , @xmath16 and @xmath17 the energy and momentum of the scattered electron , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the invariant amplitude of electron - nucleon elastic scattering .",
    "@xmath19 is the nuclear effect contribution expressed in terms of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; the initial nucleon momentum , the momentum transfer , and the energy transfer , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is proportional to the imaginary part of the @xmath23 green s function . for high - energy scattering ,",
    "we apply a factorization approximation , a convolution of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 green s functions : @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is proportional to the @xmath25 green s function , and is proportional to the nuclear spectral function .",
    "the spectral function describes the probability of removing a nucleon of the momentum @xmath20 with the removal energy @xmath22 from the nucleus , which is usually referred to as the ( nuclear ) spectral function .",
    "@xmath28 is proportional to the @xmath25 green s function .",
    "it describes the probability for adding a nucleon , thus describing the final - state interactions of the knocked - out nucleon as it goes out the residual target nucleus .    for the neutrino - nucleus quasi - elastic cross section , the invariant amplitude of electron - nucleon scattering",
    "is replaced by that of neutrino - nucleon scattering @xcite with the same @xmath19 . for the quasi - free @xmath2 production cross section ,",
    "different forms are used for both of the invariant amplitude and @xmath28 .",
    "the electron - nucleon scattering amplitudes used in this calculation are of the standard form , but we use the most up - to - date vector nucleon form factors @xcite and @xmath29 transition form factors @xcite . as to the invariant neutrino - nucleon amplitude , we use the standard dipole form factor with @xmath30 gev .     of @xmath0o @xcite .",
    "]    the models used in this paper are the relativistic , simple fermi - gas model ( fg ) and a realistic spectral function model ( sf ) .",
    "fg was used by e. moniz and his collaborators more than three decades ago @xcite .",
    "it is known to yield a good description of the total cross section , but to fail to provide a reliable detailed description such the transverse and longitudinal cross sections separately @xcite . in fg , @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "are given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the effective fermi - momentum parameter , @xmath33 with @xmath34 the effective nuclear binding - energy parameter and @xmath35 the nucleon mass , and @xmath36 . in our calculation , we take @xmath37 to be 225 mev and @xmath34 27 mev @xcite . note that eq .",

    "sf uses a more realistic description of the initial , ground - state nucleus .",

    "( [ sfpp ] ) for @xmath28 represents the pwia we use .",
    "we now compare our calculation with electron-@xmath0o scattering data at various incident energies . for a reference , we also include the results for electron-@xmath40c quasi - elastic scattering .",
    "the experimental data we compare to are @xmath0o@xmath41 at the scattering angle @xmath42 for the incident energy @xmath430.7 , 0.88 , 1.08 , and 1.2 gev @xcite , @xmath40c@xmath41 at @xmath44 for @xmath45 gev @xcite and at @xmath46 for @xmath47 gev @xcite .",
    "figure [ oxygen ] includes four figures of the @xmath0o cross sections at the four incident energies .",
    "the quasi - elastic scattering contribution appears as the most prominent peak on the left - handed side of each figure .",
    "we see that fg overestimates the quasi - elastic contribution at all energies , but sf agrees with the data better especially above 1 gev .",
    "the fg quasi - elastic contribution has a parabola shape , but the sf contribution has tails at both sides of the energy , especially prominent on the high energy side . in sf ,",
    "the strength at the peak is reduced , moving mostly to the high - energy tail region , as a consequence of the inclusion of high - momentum components due to nuclear correlations , in the spectral function in @xmath48 .",
    "fg and sf yield similar contributions to the quasi - free @xmath2 peak , in a good agreement with the data at all energies . in the `` dip '' region between the two peaks ,",
    "both of the fg and sf contributions are smaller than the data .",

    "we use @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 mb for this simple estimate .",
    "figure [ fsi ] shows that the final - state interactions move the strength in the quasi - elastic peak to the tail regions , and thus broaden the quasi - elastic peak .",
    "we see that the deficit in the strength between the two peaks of the quasi - elastic scattering and quasi - free @xmath2 production is somewhat reduced and the agreement with the data is improved somewhat .    in this work ,",
    "we have not considered other pion production process than the quasi - free @xmath2 production . for this , some phenomenological @xcite and theoretical work @xcite are available .",

    ", @xmath59 is small and the pauli blocking ( pb ) plays the major role even in this high - energy region .",
    "accordingly , in addition to the use of the same fg as before , we use two - types of sf ; without pb as previously shown in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , and with pb as @xmath61 in this way , we include in sf a part of final - state interaction effects , which is generated by pb .",
    "@xmath62 takes a more complicated form when the effects are included more realistically , and the calculation here is a simple estimate .    the @xmath4-@xmath0o quasi - elastic cross section thus calculated is shown in fig .",
    "[ q2 ] . by comparing the cross sections by the two types of sf",
    "cross sections , with and without pb , we see that the pauli blocking clearly plays a decisive role and that the cross sections calculated by sf with pb and by fg are quite close in the low @xmath59 region .",
    "this is reasonable since sf with pb and fg use the same @xmath62 by incorporating pb in the same way .",
    "note that the the small @xmath59 contribution is usually not considered in the case of electron scattering as the cross section diverges for @xmath63 and also the incident beam line experimentally prevents a measurement close to forward . in the case of the high - energy neutrino scattering ,",
    "the situation is quite different as we know : ample events appear near the forward , making it vital to understand the forward depression as shown in fig .",
    "we note that , though not shown here , the electron scattering cross sections given in figs .  2 - 3 are changed little by the inclusion of the pauli blocking effect ( 9 ) . the momentum transfer associated with the kinematics examined in these figures is large .",

    "figure [ del ] compares the cross sections calculated by the three different ways as before : fg and sf with and without pb .",
    "the difference between sp with and without pb observed in low @xmath59 region in fig.5 corresponds to that at the higher end of @xmath64 spectrum in this figure .",
    "fg yields a larger high - energy peak contribution .",
    "this difference is _ not _ due to the pauli blocking , but due to the nuclear correlation effects in the spectral function : the difference is after all associated with scattered muons at a high energy .",
    "this difference should show up in the forward angle cross section .",
    "we emphasize that _ this difference may have a direct effect on neutrino oscillation measurements_.",
    "we have carried out a relativistic calculation of the cross sections of electron-@xmath0o and -@xmath1c quasi - elastic scattering and quasi - free @xmath2 production and have compared with the data systematically in the wide energy range of 0.5  1.5 gev . using the same formalism ,",
    "we have then examined the @xmath4 quasi - elastic scattering from @xmath0o .",
    "we find that spectral function calculation agrees better with the experimental data @xmath65 than a uniform fermi - gas model .",
    "in particular , this is important to explain the `` dip region '' between the quasi - elastic interaction and the delta production kinematics .",
    "a uniform fermi - gas model can not fill the dip region .",
    "in addition , the total cross section does not change between the uniform fermi - gas model and the spectral function calculation within 10% , but the differential cross section as functions of the scattered muon energy changes as much as 2030% .",
    "we think that this is very important for the future neutrino experiments aiming at @xmath9 or better precision .",
