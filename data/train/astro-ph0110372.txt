    "here we are just outlining the major statistical results of the study .",
    "in 21 of the observed sources show bipolar structure , they are very massive and energetic and show higher collimation factors than previous studies .",
    "mean outflow parameters are :       fig .",
    "1 presents comparisons of different quantities within our sample to previous studies in the low- and high - mass regime .",
    "1(a ) shows that previously determined correlations in the low - mass regime between the mechanical force @xmath3 and the core mass @xmath4 seem to be valid for massive star formation regions as well .",
    "we consider this as support for similar physical processes driving outflows of all masses .",
    "it looks different in fig 1(b ) , where we plot the mass entrainment rate versus the luminosity .",
    "obviously , at the high - mass end those data are not correlated . while outflows in low - mass regions can be identified usually with one protostar , massive stars form in clusters , and the resolution is not sufficient to resolve the driving sources exactly .",
    "thus , possibly the flows are driven from one of the youngest sources whereas the main part of luminosity might stem from a more evolved source , which could already have reached the main sequence .",
    "but so far this is speculation and has to be investigated at higher resolution in detail .",
    "our data indicate high mean accretion rates @xmath5 for @xmath6 in a few cases larger than @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , we see a tight correlation between the mass of the molecular outflow and the core mass ( fig .",
    "the ratio of both quantities is rather constant with a mean of 0.04 .",
    "as outlined in beuther et al .",
