    "then the second term in  ( [ eq : qc ] ) is of order @xmath52 and can be neglected .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : qc ] ) says that the more chain entropy the polymer has ( the more flexible it is ) the _ sooner _ it collapses when folding at the transition temperature .",
    "calorimetric measurements of the conformational entropy change per residue in unfolding to the coil state for say barnase give @xmath53 per residue  @xcite .",
    "this entropy also counts side chain conformational entropy , which is estimated to be about @xmath54 per residue  @xcite , giving a net chain conformational entropy of about @xmath55 per residue in the coil state , and therefore @xmath56 .",
    "for typical off - lattice simulations  @xcite @xmath57 , therefore @xmath58 .",
    "so collapse typically occurs before the barrier is reached ( see fig .",

    "the values of non - native packing density obtained from simulations appear to be smaller than one , probably because of finite size and stiffness effects . applying bulk thermodynamics to the residual segments of non - native polymer may not be an accurate approximation in some cases .",
    "more complete treatments of the coupling of density with native similarity can be made within the energy landscape framework  @xcite .",
    "it is fairly straightforward to write an approximate free energy as a function of both @xmath63 and @xmath1 and then minimize with respect to @xmath63 to obtain the density as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we have taken the simplest approach here to illustrate the coupling of collapse with the thermodynamics .",
    "some cautionary notes are made in appendix a regarding a possible reversal of the trend on barrier height in small , stiff proteins , or proteins with a significant amount of generic self - attraction .",
    "what about the rate ? the question is now whether the increase in prefactor is larger than the decrease in barrier height , as we add non - native heterogeneity .",
    "since the ruggedness is weak , the kinetics are single exponential ( there is a single dominant folding barrier ) , and a kramers law holds for the rate : k ^-1(b ) ^-(b)/t , [ rate1 ] where the prefactor is proportional to the reciprocal of the reconfiguration time scale  @xcite .",
    "if we were to follow the argument for the dependency of the prefactor on ruggedness for an uncorrelated landscape  @xcite , or for a correlated landscape at low temperature with activated dynamics  @xcite , we would find that the ratio of rates .",

    "so by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : k1 ] ) , in this low temperature regime the rate may go up or may go down with non - native interaction strength .",

    "the existence of such a temperature scale can be seen from the following simple argument  @xcite .",
    "we can think of escape from a trap as a mini - unfolding event : escape is driven by entropy and is opposed by the putative trap s low energy , say @xmath68 . then , as in unfolding , the escape barrier arises from a mismatch between entropy gains and energy losses as the system reconfigures out of the trap , so we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq : f ] ) for the free energy relative to the state @xmath69 as f(q ) = q e_i - t s_c ( q ) - ( 1-q ) [ eq : trap ] where @xmath5 in  ( [ eq : f ] ) is replaced by @xmath68 , @xmath1 in  ( [ eq : f ] ) is replaced by @xmath70 , defined as the fraction of contacts shared with state @xmath69 , and density changes during untrapping are not particularly important since @xmath71 ( energetic trapping occurs only when the polymer is collapsed  @xcite ) .",
    "the transition to unactivated dynamics occurs when the states typically occupied at that temperature have zero escape barrier . setting @xmath68 in  ( [ eq : trap ] ) to the thermal energy of states at temperature @xmath72 ,  ) at @xmath24 . for strata of states with @xmath73",

    "there is a regime near the g hamiltonian where the rate is relatively robust to changes in non - native interaction strength .",
    "the density of non - native polymer must be greater at the barrier peak than in the unfolded state for rate enhancement to be observed .",
    "why does the rate initially increase ?",
    "the upshot is as follows .",
    "first , it follows from energy landscape theory that if there is no change in density upon folding , then changes in ruggedness do not affect the barrier height for a well - designed protein ( c.f .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) ) , that is , effects on the barrier must come from the coupling of non - native density to the degree of nativeness . moreover , the strength of the ruggedness per residue increases with non - native density since there are simply more interactions , and non - native density tends to increase with nativeness , at least for weak non - native interaction strength .",
    "then , since ruggedness lowers the free energy , the free energy at the barrier position is lowered more than the unfolded free energy .",
    "so as non - native interaction strength is increased from zero , the barrier lowers and the rate increases if the effect on the prefactor is weaker .",
    "but the prefactor is related to the reconfigurational diffusion time  @xcite , and since a dynamic glass transition is expected in such systems , there will be a window for weak ruggedness within which the diffusion time is relatively unaffected as ruggedness is increased .",

    "( [ eq : bar ] ) assumed mean - field theory could be applied , that the protein could could be treated as a bulk system , and that properties arising from chain connectivity would not alter the results arising from the energetics in the problem .",
    "in particular we have assumed that the polymer persistence length or kuhn length @xmath100 is much less than the length of a typical piece of disordered protein @xmath101 near the barrier peak , so that a dangling piece of disordered polymer may interact with itself .",
    "if the protein under study is particularly stiff and/or small , the return length of polymer fragments may be comparable to the length of the disordered pieces , reducing the number of non - native interactions near the barrier peak relative to the number in the unfolded state . then in eq .",
