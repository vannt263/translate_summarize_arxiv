    "in many quantum field models , non - perturbative results may be obtained from the @xmath12 expansion  @xcite , which at leading orders resums only a certain class of graphs of the original perturbation series in the coupling . in parallel , for a given perturbative series there are more direct efficient summation techniques , like the borel@xcite or pad@xcite methods , as well as generalizations combining the latter two@xcite .",
    "typically , the borel method is useful even for non borel - summable perturbative expansions , as for instance in qcd , since it gives interesting informations on the incompleteness of the pure perturbation theory , and the necessary additional non - perturbative ( power corrections ) contributions to a given physical quantity .",
    "also , a rather different modification of the usual perturbation theory , known as delta - expansion ( de ) or  variationally improved perturbation \" ( vip)@xcite , is based on a reorganization of the interaction lagrangian such that it depends on arbitrary adjustable parameters , to be fixed by some optimization prescription . in @xmath13 field theories ,",
    "the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator typically , de - vip is in fact equivalent@xcite to the  order - dependent mapping \" ( odm ) resummation method@xcite , and optimization is equivalent to a rescaling of the adjustable oscillator mass with perturbative order , which can essentially suppress the factorial large order behaviour of ordinary perturbative coefficients .",
    "this appropriate rescaling of a trial mass parameter was proven to give a rigorously convergent series@xcite e.g. for the oscillator energy levels@xcite and related quantities .",
    "in the present paper we reconsider yet another alternative expansion , proposed some time ago@xcite@xcite , which is close to ( and partly inspired by ) the de - vip idea , but particularly suited to apply generically to arbitrary higher dimensional ( renormalizable ) models . rather similarly with the @xmath12 expansion , it starts with a specific approximation but can include , at least in principle , the full information from the lagrangian in a systematical way .",
    "the basic construction exploits a physically motivated renormalization group ( rg )  self - consistent mass \" solution , which resums rg dependence to all orders ( at least in specific renormalization schemes ) .",
    "moreover it provides a non - perturbative information , encoded in the infrared properties of an implicit function @xmath14 , which may be viewed as a generalization of the logarithm , and occurring as the exact solution of the above mentioned rg equation with the self - consistent mass boundary condition . at first rg order",
    ", @xmath15 is essentially the lambert function@xcite , where @xmath16 depends in a simple way on the mass and coupling rg coefficients ( @xmath17 is the renormalization scale - invariant lagrangian mass and @xmath5 the basic rg scale ) . unlike the logarithm",

    "this transmutes the ordinary expansion ( in the coupling @xmath24 ) of physical ( on - shell ) green functions , depending explicitly on a single mass @xmath25 , into a @xmath0 expansion , or equivalently a ( mass ) power expansion in @xmath26 for sufficiently small @xmath17 .",
    "the main idea is to use those properties of @xmath7 , in asymptotically free theories ( aft ) , to infer a non trivial mass gap @xmath27@xcite in the deep infrared ( strongly coupled ) regime , equivalently here the massless limit @xmath28 .",
    "more generally other physical quantities can be derived similarly , for instance the quark condensate @xmath29 , one of the order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking ( sb ) in qcd@xcite ) , from their known perturbative expression for @xmath30 . at this stage , it is important to remark that our construction is not by itself a proof of dynamical ( chiral ) symmetry breaking , and applies indeed independently of whether chiral symmetry is ( dynamically ) broken or not : it introduces rather an explicit chiral symmetry breaking mass @xmath17 in the lagrangian , in such a way that the properties of @xmath14 encode a non trivial @xmath31 ratio , smoothly extrapolated from the massive case @xmath32 .",
    "this is to be simply viewed as a generalization , for @xmath33 , of dimensional transmutation@xcite .",
    "+ unfortunately , such an extrapolation to @xmath34 is well - defined as far as the pure rg dependence of the relevant physical quantities is concerned , while it turns out to be badly afflicted when considering for the latter their complete perturbative ( non - rg - dependent ) expansion coefficients with their expected behaviour at large orders . as is well - known , in most models the leading large order behaviour of purely perturbative coefficients exhibit same signs ( thus non borel summable ) factorial divergences ( the infrared renormalon singularities@xcite ) .",
    "the standard and seemingly unavoidable interpretation is that it implies large perturbative ambiguities , e.g. of @xmath35 for the ( pole ) mass gap , reflecting incompleteness of purely perturbative expansions and the necessity of adding non - perturbative power corrections .",
    "however , our alternative expansion can be smoothly extrapolated down to small , and even _ negative _ ( or more generally complex ) values of the expansion parameter @xmath0 , thanks again to the properties of @xmath7 , in such a way that the corresponding perturbative series can be borel summable@xcite .",
    "more precidely , in the simplest situation ( corresponding to the rg parameter particular value @xmath36 ) , there is one branch of @xmath7 such that @xmath37 , which simply produces the required sign - alternation in the perturbative coefficients @xmath38 . in this particularly simple case @xmath36 , the range where @xmath39 happens to correspond also to @xmath40",
    "this is not a problem in principle , since in relativistically invariant theories the absolute sign of the lagrangian mass term is irrelevant to physical quantities , moreover in our context the physically relevant results are in the massless ( chiral symmetric ) limit anyway . thus taking @xmath41<0",
    "$ ] ( @xmath42 { \\raisebox{-0.13cm}{~\\shortstack{$<$ \\\\[-0.07 cm ] $ \\sim$}}~}0 $ ] ) simply corresponds physically to reach a strongly coupled regime near the massless lagrangian limit , but without the usual ambiguities from renormalons .",
    "more generally , i.e. for an arbitrary aft in an arbitrary scheme , as we shall examine there exist ( complex ) branches of @xmath7 near the relevant massless limit , which is sufficient to ensure borel summability , the borel singularities being moved away from the real axis .",
    "those different branches of @xmath7 may correspond either to @xmath43 or to @xmath44 .",
    "we shall argue that the actual physical result is indeed independent of the branch on which the massless limit is reached , though the ( unphysical ) perturbative expansions have obviously different borel summation properties depending on the branch of @xmath7 considered .",
    "+ independently of these borel convergence properties of the @xmath0-series , we can also consider , in a second stage , an appropriate version of the ( order  dependently rescaled )  variationally improved \" perturbation ( de - vip ) , to be performed on the series in @xmath45 , essentially replacing the true physical mass by an arbitrary adjustable , trial mass parameter .",
    "this produces a renormalization scheme ( rs ) dependent factorial _ damping _ of the original perturbative coefficients at large orders , similarly to the oscillator case@xcite .",
    "now here , the damping appears insufficient to make the de - vip series readily convergent for arbitrary @xmath25 , but can further improve@xcite the borel convergence properties , which are also obtained typically for @xmath41 < 0 $ ] .",
    "+ the basics of our construction was defined before@xcite , and some of its phenomenological applications explored , to some extent , in qcd  @xcite .",
    "however , those previous numerical results were based on rather ad hoc approximations , either by constructing approximants only based on the lowest orders of the perturbative expansion , and by optimization with respect to the renormalization scale and/or scheme@xcite . in particular , it ignored completely the above mentioned ambiguities due to the large order , factorial behaviour of perturbative expansions .",
    "we are thus mainly concerned in the present paper to provide a more concrete illustration of the formal borel convergence results obtained in @xcite , by considering the mass gap of the @xmath10 gross - neveu ( gn ) model@xcite , known for arbitrary @xmath11 values from exact s matrix results@xcite and thermodynamic bethe ansatz@xcite similarly applicable@xcite in many other integrable 2-d models .",
    "those exact results serve as a test of our method , which is based in contrast only on the perturbative information , thus applying a priori to any other ( asymptotically free ) renormalizable models , e.g. in four dimensions , for which there are obviously no exact s - matrix results available .",
    "typical examples are 4-d gauged aft with @xmath46 massless fermions , like qcd , where the expected@xcite @xmath47 breaking is characterized via non - perturbative order parameters , generalizing the role of the mass gap in simpler models of dynamical symmetry breaking@xcite .",

    ", we reexamine the borel convergence properties@xcite obtained for @xmath39 in the simplest situation , providing also a more detailed analysis of some technical issues .",
    "section 5 and 6 analyse how the variationally improved perturbation ( de - vip ) can further improve these borel convergence properties , and in section 6 are also introduced other ( non - linear ) convenient generalizations of the simpler de - vip construction , which can lead to a directly convergent alternative series .",
