    "as discussed in mathur et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) and in @xcite , the only way to detect low - mass supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) may be by their accretion activity .",
    "we choose to use x - ray selection to identify candidate agns for the following reasons : first , x - ray emission is a hallmark of agns .",
    "second , x - rays can penetrate obscuring material which may be hiding the line emitting regions .",
    "third , there are fewer sources of x - rays in a galaxy than there are of optical and uv emission and so dilution of the agn signature by host galaxy light is less of a problem , even if the agn is moderately obscured .",
    "fourth , even if , as expected in some theories @xcite agns that have luminosities or accretion rates below a cut - off value do not have broad - line regions , they should still be detectable in x - rays .",
    "the disadvantage is that x - ray observations by themselves can not always distinguish between agns and other x - ray sources , such as x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "multi - wavelength data are needed to determine the type of source .",
    "as examples , we present here two late - type spiral galaxies , ngc 3184 and ngc 5457 ( m101 ) .",
    "their nuclear optical spectra show no signs of agns @xcite . but using archival _",
    "chandra _  data and multi - wavelength data from the literature ,",
    "we show that the sum total of evidence strongly suggests that the galaxies host agns .",
    "this galaxy is of type scd , classified as having an hii nucleus by @xcite , and is at a distance of 8.7 mpc @xcite .",
    "the argument for the presence of an agn is based on the following : ( a ) _ the nucleus is an x - ray source_. observations with _",
    "chandra _  totaling 60 ks detect a point - like source with 36 counts and a more extended component with 117 counts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n31n54 ] ) . assuming a power - law spectrum with slope @xmath0 and correcting for galactic absorption only , the point source has luminosity @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "luminosities in this range are typically associated with xrbs rather than agns , but does not rule out an agn , especially since intrinsic absorption is unknown .",
    "( b ) _ infrared line ratios are not that of an hii nucleus but instead suggest the presence of an agn component_. a stronger argument that the source is an agn derives from infrared data .",
    "this galaxy is part of the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite have used the equivalent width of the pah feature at @xmath3 m and the fluxes in a mix of high- and low - ionization ir lines of s , ne , and o to create diagnostic diagrams that distinguish between agn and star - forming galaxies .",
    "this nucleus falls into the `` transition '' region between agns and hii regions .",
    "this suggests that the emission has an agn component that was diluted because of the large aperture used ( @xmath4 ) to extract the fluxes .",
    "( c ) _ mid - infrared colors are redder than those of normal galaxies_. the observed irac colors , @xmath5-[4.5 ] = + 0.20 $ ] @xmath6 and @xmath7-[8.0 ] = + 1.24 $ ] @xmath6 ( magnitudes in vega system ) ( d.  a.  dale , priv .",
    "comm . ) , are redder than more than 80% of normal late - type galaxies ( fig .  [",
    "fig : n3184 ] ; also see @xcite ) .",
    "this is expected if there is an agn , as agn power - law emission falls off more slowly than galactic emission in the mir .",
    "thus , the ir line ratios and irac colors strongly argue that the source is an agn .     on a side and",

    "ngc 5457 is a galaxy of type scd at a distance of approximately 7 mpc @xcite .",
    "the nucleus was classified as hii by @xcite .",
    "ngc 5457 was observed multiple times by _ chandra _  for a total observing time of approximately 1 ms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n31n54 ] ) . for this galaxy",
    "the x - ray data by themselves provide evidence suggesting the presence of an agn .",
    "( a ) _ the nucleus is an x - ray source_. ( b ) even more importantly , _ the nuclear source is variable_. the nucleus varies by about a factor of 10 over nine months ( fig .  [ fig : n5457 ] ) , with luminosity ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the variability rules out multiple xrbs as the origin of the x - ray emission , as they would have to be varying in phase .",
    "it is possible for a single xrb to produce the observed x - ray emission , but xrbs with luminosities this high are uncommon .",
    "( c ) _ the x - ray spectrum _ shows an absorbed power - law with slope @xmath13 , similar to what is seen in agns .",
    "the best - fit intrinsic absorption is consistent with zero when the source is faint .",
    "( d ) _ the ratios of 0.32 kev , 25 kev , and 58 kev counts _ for this nucleus are similar to those seen in compton - thick agns @xcite .",
    "points ( c ) and ( d ) together suggest a highly obscured agn where , like in the seyfert galaxy ngc 1068 , the dominant observed emission is radiation that has been scattered into our line of sight . finally , ( e ) as can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : n5457 ] , _ the behavior of the nucleus is markedly different from that of a known star cluster _ of comparable x - ray luminosity which is @xmath14 pc away from the nucleus .",
    "this suggests the nuclear source is not simply another star cluster .",
    "there are compelling , though not conclusive , arguments that ngc 3184 and ngc 5457 actually host agns even though neither shows signs of agns in their optical spectra .",
    "these agns are excellent candidates for being low - mass smbhs , as they reside in low - mass bulges .",
    "a similar approach can be used to uncover more candidate low - mass smbhs .",
    "we are grateful to d.  a.  dale for kindly providing _ spitzer _",
    "fluxes for the nucleus of ngc 3184 prior to publication .",
    "support for this work was provided by the national aeronautics and space administration through chandra award number go7 - 8111x issued by the chandra x - ray observatory center , which is operated by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory for and on behalf of the national aeronautics space administration under contract nas8 - 03060 ."
