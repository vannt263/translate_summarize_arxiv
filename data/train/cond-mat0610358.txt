    "nano - electromechanical devices , i.e. , nanostructures in which electric transport through a device is influenced by its mechanical degrees of freedom and vice versa , have attracted a lot of interest recently.@xcite on the one hand , these devices are promising for applications like sensors or ultra - sensitive mass detectors . on the other hand",
    ", they have opened up new directions in fundamental research , with projects to cool nanomechanical systems to the quantum limit.@xcite    the nanomechanical properties of single - electron transistors ( sets ) are of particular interest in this context .",
    "the central island of a set may be allowed to mechanically move between the two leads , such that electrons can tunnel on the island if the island has approached one lead and leave it again once it has mechanically moved to the other lead .",
    "these `` shuttles '' have been investigated in great detail . @xcite",
    "another possibility to couple the electrical and mechanical properties of the device is to design the set such that its capacitive coupling to the gate depends on the displacement of a mechanical oscillator .",
    "thus , mechanical degrees of freedom of the system may strongly influence the current - voltage characteristics , current noise , and higher cumulants of the current.@xcite it has been shown that the coulomb blockade peaks are split for harmonic oscillations and are broadened by thermal oscillations .",
    "knowledge of the set transport properties therefore allows one to determine the characteristics of the oscillator , such as its amplitude and frequency . in such systems ,",
    "electron tunneling through the island also has an effect on the motion of the oscillator .",
    "this back - action leads to fluctuations in the oscillator position and to damping.@xcite    practical implementations of oscillator - coupled set transistors can be realized by combining nanostructured silicon resonators with metallic sets.@xcite another possibility is to build sets from suspended carbon nanotubes that act as quantum dots.@xcite quite recently , mechanical oscillations of the nanotube in such a device have been directly observed.@xcite    in the following , we will consider a set transistor coupled to a classical harmonic oscillator .",
    "this system has already been studied extensively.@xcite however , previous studies investigated the regime where the coupling between the oscillator and the set is weak and the question what happens when the coupling is increased is still of great theoretical interest,@xcite even if this regime is not readily accessible in the current generation of experiments . in this article",
    ", we will use a combination of a master - equation approach and a numerical monte carlo procedure to calculate the electrical current and its second and third cumulants and study how they are modified by coupling to the oscillator , in the regime where the coupling is strong .",
    "we will also study the frequency dependence of the transport noise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ set - oscillator ] , we discuss the system and the model whose strong - coupling limit will be studied in the subsequent sections .",

    "is modified dramatically in the strong - coupling regime . in section [ average_current ] , we calculate the average current through the device at the charge - degeneracy point of the set at which the current is maximal and discuss the deviations from the weak - coupling results .",
    "finally , in sections [ noise_higher_moments ] and [ frequency - dependent_noise ] we extend our studies to the current noise and the third cumulant of the current .",

    "[ probx - kappa ] , as @xmath0 is increased , the stationary position probability distribution evolves continuously from the weak - coupling gaussian form to a distribution showing two sharp peaks at @xmath30 and @xmath68 in the limit where @xmath87 .",

    "this should not only be seen as natural consequence of the fact that the typical distance @xmath32 scales like @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , the main cause of the appearance of the two sharp peaks is that small amplitude oscillations about each of the two equilibrium points become very stable when @xmath0 is increased .",

    "symmetry breaking arises since these regions are located only on one side of each equilibrium point .",

    ", the system can not be characterized by a steady - state probability distribution , and our model is not appropriate .",
    "therefore , we only studied the parameter range @xmath102 .",
    "a similar reasoning applies to coulomb - blockade region , where the damping of the oscillator s motion is severely suppressed .",
    "however , numerically finding a steady - state solution close to the degeneracy point is possible .",
    "the average current flowing through the set is closely tied to the oscillator s position distributions via the position - dependent tunneling rates .",
    "consequently , one expects that the deviations from the weak - coupling behavior observed in @xmath103 would affect the current characteristics when @xmath0 is increased .",
    "just like in the previous section , we focus on the degeneracy point where the average charge state of the island is @xmath104 . at this point , the weak - coupling theory predicts@xcite that the current decreases linearly with increasing @xmath0 : @xmath105 .",
    "this decrease in the current can be explained in a qualitative way by the reduction of the overlap of the distributions @xmath90 and @xmath81 as the coupling is increased , each distribution becoming more localized around its equilibrium point , see fig .",

    "( [ approximations ] ) . when either @xmath108 or @xmath109 is not negligible , these rates allow unphysical backward currents that are not present in the full master equation .",
    "for example , a point located at @xmath110 in the steady - state probability distribution @xmath111 would contribute negatively to the average current when using the rates calculated within the weak - coupling approximation while it would not contribute to the current when taking into account the full expression for the rates given in eq .",

    "first , we note that the actual value of the fano factor is increased dramatically for lower oscillator frequencies , as expected from the term @xmath191 that dominates in the low - frequency regime . in the weak - coupling region ( @xmath192 ) , the magnitude of the normalized third cumulant is also heavily affected by a change in frequency , in agreement with the weak - coupling leading order dependence @xmath177 . despite these major changes in magnitude of both the fano factor and the normalized third cumulant ,",

    "also , the normalized third cumulant always shows a change of sign , albeit at an @xmath86-dependent value of @xmath0 , and goes to a positive for @xmath193 .",
    "remarkably , the value of the normalized third cumulant is much less sensitive to @xmath86 in the strong - coupling regime .",

    ", we follow the approach developed by macdonald@xcite that was used recently to study the noise properties of mesoscopic systems , including coupled set - nanomechanical systems in the weak - coupling regime . in general , the current - noise power at junction @xmath202 is defined as the fourier transform of the current autocorrelation function @xmath203 at junction @xmath154 , @xmath204 where @xmath205 to proceed with the macdonald approach , @xmath206 , and therefore @xmath207 , must be assumed to be statistically fluctuating variables , such that the autocorrelation function @xmath203 is independent of @xmath56 . in this case , the macdonald formula relates the fluctuation @xmath208 about the average of the number of charges @xmath118 that went through a junction in time @xmath209 , @xmath210 to the current - noise power via @xmath211 where @xmath212 . since @xmath213 and @xmath214 are easily accessible through the monte carlo simulation , @xmath197 can be calculated by taking a numerical time - derivative of @xmath215 and then evaluating the fourier sine - transform .",

    "we have used a combination of a master - equation approach and a numerical monte carlo procedure to calculate the position distribution of the oscillator , the electrical current , and the zero - frequency noise in both the weak - coupling and strong - coupling regime . with increasing coupling , we found that the position distribution of the oscillator evolves from a broad gaussian to a a function sharply peaked around each of the charge - state dependent equilibrium positions of the oscillator .",
    "we found that the average current in the strong - coupling regime is higher than the value predicted by the weak- coupling theory and that the fano factor varies in a non - monotonous fashion when coupling is increased .",

    "we have also studied the frequency - dependent transport noise . even in the strong - coupling regime , there are no peaks for frequencies higher than @xmath216 , and the two peaks found in the weak - coupling limit merge on increasing the coupling strength . finally , we introduced a generalized expression connecting the damping rate in the strong - coupling regime with the other parameters of our model and used it to understand the evolution of the oscillator s damping - renormalized frequency as a function of coupling .",

    "monte carlo methods have been used for a long time to calculate numerically the transport properties of mesoscopic systems like sets.@xcite when dealing with a simple set system , the idea of the monte carlo approach is to solve the master equation for the charge states of the set by discretizing time into small intervals and allowing charge transfer to and from the dot with a probability that is proportional to the tunneling rates and the time interval between two attempts .    if the set is coupled to a harmonic oscillator , we can proceed in a similar way , by considering charge transfer attempts at a finite frequency @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is a dimensionless step size .",
