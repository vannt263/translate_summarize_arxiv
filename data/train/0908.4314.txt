    "the primary goal of string cosmology is to find a successful compactification that can produce inflation consistent with current observations .",
    "the physical quantities characterizing the shape or the size of extra dimensions are called moduli . in the point of four dimensional theory",
    ", the existence of moduli appears as scalar fields .",
    "they play important roles in supergravity models obtained as low energy limit of superstring theory .",
    "for example , since the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton determines the strength of the gravitational coupling , a rolling dilaton implies a changing gravitational constant . also the extra dimensions should be compact and small through the cosmological evolution of the early universe .",
    "thus the volume modulus of the extra dimensions ( radion ) should be stabilized in any cosmological models in order not to conflict with current observations .",
    "to stabilize the moduli fields in string theory , various models and mechanisms were introduced ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one way to achieve the moduli stabilization is adopting the framework of string / brane gas cosmology based on the mechanism of brandenberger and vafa @xcite . in the study of string",
    "cosmology it is found that a gas of extended objects ( strings and branes ) could affect the evolution of the universe in the presence of nontrivial topology .",
    "a gas of strings or branes can be coupled to a cosmological background in the same way as a gas of point particles is coupled to a background of standard einstein gravity .",
    "many of the works on string / brane gas cosmology were concentrated on the stabilization of the radion assuming that the dilaton can be stabilized by some other mechanism @xcite .",
    "some of the key factors that can specify the cosmological evolution in string cosmology are the spacetime dimensionality , the geometry and topology , the location of sources , orientifold planes , and fluxes . in the previous work @xcite ,",
    "we evaluated the effective potentials , induced by brane gas , bulk flux , and supergravity particles , that govern the sizes of the observed three and extra six dimensions .",
    "we found that the internal volume can oscillate between two turning points or sit at the minimum of the potential while the three - dimensional volume expands indefinitely .",
    "however , in string or brane cosmology , one has to study the dynamics involving both the radion and the dilaton @xcite since branes in general couple to both the dilaton and the radion .",
    "recently it has been studied that a nonperturbatively generated potential by gaugino condensation and a gas of strings can stabilize both the dilaton and the radial modulus in heterotic string theory @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to study how the running of the dilaton affects the behavior of the three - dimensional volume factor and the radion .",
    "it is already known that the bulk fluxes can generate potentials to stabilize the moduli in string theory @xcite and in randall - sundrum scenario @xcite .",
    "we will make use of a bulk ramond - ramond ( rr ) flux to stabilize simultaneously both the dilaton and the radion in brane gas formalism of type ii string theory .",
    "we will show that it is possible to stabilize both moduli dynamically by an attractor mechanism , while the three - dimensional volume can expand monotonically .",
    "the crucial point is that the coupling of dilaton to brane and rr gauge field induces confining potentials for stabilization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider a cosmological formalism based on the dilaton gravity with a four - form bulk rr flux and a six - dimensional brane gas . in sec .",
    "iii , we set up the equations of motion for the dilaton , the six - dimensional internal subspace , and the three - dimensional subspace .",
    "then we reduce them to motions of a particle under an effective potential .",
    "we will show that the radion and the dilaton can be stabilized separately if one of the two is fixed . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider the dynamical stabilization of the two fields . in sec .",
    "v , we conclude and discuss .",
    "in the point of string theory , the gravitational interaction is described by the coupled system of metric and dilaton .",
    "we consider the dilaton cosmology with a bulk rr flux and a brane gas . to be specific ,",
    "let us start from the following bulk effective action of type ii string theory @xcite s_b = d^d+1x , [ bulkea ] where @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the @xmath2-dimensional unification scale , @xmath3 is the dilaton field , @xmath4 is the four - form rr field strength , and @xmath5 is the dilaton potential . although we will consider the @xmath6 case , we will keep @xmath7 to see the dimensional dependence of our analysis .",
    "we suppose that the matter contribution of a single brane to the action is represented by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action of a @xmath8-brane s_p - brane = - t_p d^p+1 e^- , [ pbraneea ] where @xmath9 is the tension of the @xmath8-brane and @xmath10 is the induced metric to the brane _ = g_mn . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the indices of bulk spacetime and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are those of brane .",
    "@xmath15 is the induced antisymmetric tensor field and @xmath16 is the field strength tensor of gauge field @xmath17 living on the brane .",
    "the fluctuations of the fields within the brane are negligible when the temperature is low enough .",
    "thus we neglect @xmath15 and @xmath16 terms .",
    "since the dbi action couples to both the dilaton and the radion , the brane action not only acts as a source term for gravity but also provides potentials for dilaton and radion .",
    "we consider the case that the rr flux is laid on the three dimensions where windings of brane are removed completely , while the remaining six dimensions are wrapped with gases of branes whose dimensions are less than or equal to @xmath18 . in general , the action of these gases can be written as a sum over the contributions of the gas from each string or brane state",
    ". the individual contribution is obtained by its number density and energy in a hydrodynamical approximation .",
    "however , assuming that each type of brane gas makes a comparable contribution , we consider a gas of effective @xmath18-branes whose tension we denote by @xmath19 .",
    "in other words , we consider the effect of all lower - dimensional ( @xmath20 ) brane gas as a @xmath18-brane gas .",
    "the total action can be written as s_tot = s_b + s_(d-3)-brane .    since the presence of moduli dependence in the einstein term can cause an extra tadpole for moduli from the curvature ,",
    "it is convenient to rescale the metric so that the einstein term @xmath21 is completely decoupled from other moduli . to solve the field equations we work in the ten - dimensional einstein frame , defined by g_mn^s = e^ g_mn^e . in terms of the einstein metric",
    ", the action can be written as s_b^e = d^d+1x , [ bulkeaein ] s_(d-3)-brane^e = - t_d-3 d^d-2 e^ , [ pbraneeaein ] where @xmath22 .",
    "we drop the superscript @xmath23 from now on . if one solves the field equation for @xmath4 in the einstein frame , the @xmath24 term in eq .",
    "( [ bulkeaein ] ) can give potential terms for dilaton and radion .",
    "in the point of bulk theory , the energy momentum tensor of a single @xmath18-brane has a delta function singularity at the position of the brane along the transverse directions t_(d-3)-brane^mn = - t_d-3 d^d-2 e^ ^ _ x^m _ x^n ( x - x ( ) ) . for cosmological",
    "setting , it seems natural to take a gas of such branes in a continuum approximation and this smooths the singularity by integrating over the transverse dimensions . since the dilaton potential is not known in string theory , we consider the simple case where the dilaton potential in the einstein frame is a constant @xmath25 to incorporate the cosmological constant",
    ". we will not consider its origin in detail here . with the metric ansatz ds^2 = -n^2 dt^2 + _ k=1^d a^2_k(t ) ( dx^k)^2 , the induced metric on the brane is _",
