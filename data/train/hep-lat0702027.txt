    "<S> we investigate the construction of improved actions by the monte carlo renormalization group method in the context of @xmath0 gauge theory utilizing different decimation procedures and effective actions . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the basic self - consistency requirement for correct application of mcrg , i.e. that the decimated configurations are equilibrium configurations of the adopted form of the effective action , can only be achieved by careful fine - tuning of the choice of decimation prescription and/or action .    as it is well - known , the lattice formulation is the only known non - perturbative formulation of gauge theories that gives the path integral in closed form preserving gauge invariance and positivity of the transfer matrix ( unitarity ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , strictly speaking , the only known way of actually defining ` continuum ' gauge theory non - perturbatively is by placing the lattice theory on the critical surface of a fixed point of infinite correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , therefore , one would like to have the action along the wilsonian ` renormalized trajectory ' which emanates from the fixed point and proceeds off the critical surface in only the relevant directions . </S>",
    "<S> evolved under successive renormalization group ( rg ) transformations ( ` block - spinnings ' ) , this ` perfect action ' could therefore be used to compute directly at any scale ( coarser lattices ) without any contamination from irrelevant directions , and hence any regularization artifacts , and correspondingly greatly reduced computational effort . </S>",
    "<S> concrete practical implementation of this dream , however , turns out to be rather difficult @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a more modest approach is based on the fact that the rg trajectory starting at any suitable lattice action will evolve asymptotically to the renormalized trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> thus , after successive block spinnings one should in principle arrive at an ` improved action ' which allows computation on coarser lattices with suppressed discretization errors . a way to implement </S>",
    "<S> this is through the use of the monte carlo rg ( mcrg ) in which one performs block - spinning ( decimation ) transformations on gauge field configurations obtained by monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the basic postulate here is that the decimated configurations are distributed according to the boltzmann weight of an effective action that resulted from blocking to the coarser lattice . </S>",
    "<S> one , however , does not know a priori what this action is . given a particular block - spinning prescription , the general procedure that has been followed is to assume a form of the effective action restricted to some subspace of possible interactions @xcite , and then measure the couplings in this action on the decimated configurations by one of the known methods , the demon @xcite or the ` schwinger - dyson ' method @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to point out that , given a choice of decimation prescription and a choice of an effective action , straightforward measurement of couplings on the decimated configurations will , in general , lead to erroneous results . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the decimated configurations will not be equilibrium configurations of the effective action at these couplings . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , this basic requirement underlying mcrg appears not to have been enforced in its application to gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> careful fine - tuning of the decimation prescription and/or the effective action is required to satisfy this requirement , if it can be satisfied at all within the chosen class of decimation procedures and effective actions .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the presence of the problem and how it can be resolved in @xmath0 gauge theory by exploring two different decimation prescriptions : the swendsen ( s ) decimation @xcite , and the ` double smeared blocking ' ( dsb ) decimation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both prescriptions involve a free parameter , @xmath1 , which is the weight of staples relative to straight paths in the construction of the decimated lattice bond variable out of the undecimated lattice ones . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore two different effective action models that have been proposed in the literature : the multiple - representation single plaquette action @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xmath2 ,   \\label{eq : ef_act1}\\ ] ] and the action @xcite @xmath3 + \\sum_{rect}\\beta_{12}[1-\\frac12\\chi_{1/2}(u_{1\\times2 } ) ] , \\label{eq : ef_act2}\\ ] ] containing the single plaquette ( @xmath4 loop ) and the @xmath5 planar loop in the fundamental representation . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 denotes the character of the spin-@xmath7 representation . </S>",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to investigate this , and , more generally , the efficacy of ( [ eq : ef_act1 ] ) , ( [ eq : ef_act2 ] ) as medium to long range effective actions , we consider some observables . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , for each of the actions ( [ eq : ef_act1 ] ) , ( [ eq : ef_act2 ] ) , we compare @xmath8 loops measured in two ways : ( a ) on the decimated configurations right after the decimations , and denoted @xmath9 ; ( b ) on configurations generated with the effective action at couplings measured after decimation at the optimal @xmath1-value ( dsb for ( [ eq : ef_act1 ] ) , s for ( [ eq : ef_act2 ] ) ) , and denoted @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the difference @xmath11 are displayed in table [ tab : w_diff ] and plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : w_diff ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to action ( [ eq : ef_act1 ] ) , action ( [ eq : ef_act2 ] ) shows consistent growth of the difference @xmath12 with increasing @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> it is apparent from these results that action ( [ eq : ef_act2 ] ) is failing as an accurate intermediate to long scale effective action , and must presumably be augmented by additional terms .     </S>",

    "<S> tab : w_diff ] . ]    in conclusion , the basic self - consistency requirement for correct application of mcrg is that the decimated configurations are already equilibrium configurations of the adopted form of the effective action at the couplings obtained from the decimated configurations . </S>",
    "<S> careful fine - tuning of the decimation prescription and/or the effective action form is required in order to achieve this . </S>",
    "<S> more elaborate decimation prescriptions than the simple dsb and s may be defined , which involve more than one adjustable parameter , and provide more fine - tuning control . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , more involved actions , e.g. combination of ( [ eq : ef_act1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ef_act2 ] ) , may be considered . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this program is still to be carried out for the construction of a reliable truly improved @xmath14 effective action over a wide range regime . </S>"
