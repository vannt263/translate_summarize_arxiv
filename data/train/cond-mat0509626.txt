    "the entirely uncorrelated in time stochastic signals exhibit white noise  the power spectral density @xmath5 as a function of the frequency @xmath6 is constant , while the brownian motion of the signal intensity without correlations between increments results in @xmath7 and in the lorentzian power spectra . the widespread occurring signals and processes with @xmath0 spectrum ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) can not be understood and modeled in such a way .    ``",
    "@xmath0 noise '' is a type of stochastic processes which power spectral density at low frequencies behaves like @xmath8 , where the exponent @xmath3 is close to 1 .",
    "in contrast to the brownian motion and @xmath7 noise generated by the linear stochastic equation , simple systems of differential equations , even linear stochastic equations , generating signals with @xmath0 noise are not known .    recently , starting from the simple point process model of @xmath0 noise @xcite , we derived the nonlinear stochastic differential equation @xmath9 for the signal intensity @xmath10 generating processes with pure @xmath0 noise and the inverse cubic , @xmath11 , distribution of the signal intensity @xcite . here",
