    "a small number of close binary stars are thought to dominate the dynamic evolution of many globular star clusters ( hut et al .",
    "1992 , bailyn 1995 ) , yet classes of such objects which are relatively easily found in the field have proven frustratingly difficult to discover in clusters .",
    "a prime example is cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , which call attention to themselves via large amplitude light outbursts , and peculiar , ultraviolet - excess colors in quiescence . with quiescent absolute magnitudes @xmath2",
    ", modern ground - based photometric techniques should easily uncover such objects in clusters with typical distances of @xmath3 , even with modest telescopes , unless all such objects are lost to the crowded cores . yet",
    "prior to the launch of _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , we are aware of only two candidate identifications of cvs in globular clusters , m5  v101 ( margon et al . 1981 ) , whose classification and cluster membership seems secure ( naylor et al .",
    "1989 , shara et al .",
    "1990 ) , and m30  v4 ( margon & downes 1983 ) , whose membership is unclear ( shara et al . 1990 , machin et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "observations from _ hst _ have certainly improved the situation , although perhaps not as much as many would have expected .",
    "a few clusters are now known to have a handful of spectroscopically - confirmed cvs ; a recent review is given by grindlay ( 1999 ) . however despite intensive photometric and color - selected searches deep into the cores of a number of clusters , few outbursting objects are found , and most authors believe there is a serious discrepancy with theoretical predictions ( shara & drissen 1995 ; livio 1996 ; shara et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter s96 ) .",
    "whether the problem lies with formation / destruction rates , or some unique property of cluster cvs , remains to be clarified , and will surely require a larger sample of objects .",
    "here we discuss _ hst _ observations of the cluster ngc6624 using the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) .",
    "this cluster contains near its center a highly luminous bursting x - ray source with an 11-minute period , the shortest - known binary star ; the system is thought to be a double - degenerate ( stella et al .",
    "1987 , king et al .",
    "1993 , anderson et al .",
    "another object in the cluster has also been suggested by s96 as a candidate cv , although we discuss its nature further in  3 . as part of a program to study the central bright x - ray source",
    ", we obtained deep stis spectroscopic exposures of this object , and these results will be discussed elsewhere ( deutsch et al .",
    "2000 ) . here",
    "we report the completely serendipitous discovery of @xmath1 emission line object , which fell by good fortune in the stis slit , and has the properties of a classical cv .",
    "this object deepens the mystery of the cv content of clusters .",
    "s96 report a multi - epoch sensitive photometric search of the core of ngc6624 which identifies only one candidate cv , and suggest these objects are very rare , at least in this cluster .",
    "yet we have found another such an object completely by accident , in the first long - slit ultraviolet spectral exposure made of the cluster .",
    "on 1998 march 14 we obtained 12150 s of integration in the center of ngc6624 over 5 orbits with the _ hst _ stis fuv - mama , using a @xmath4 wide , @xmath5 long slit .",
    "the spectra are reprocessed and extracted using calstis 2.0 and the latest calibration files available as of 1999 april 20 , where nearly half of the calibration files are updated from the original pipeline processing .    in fig .",
    "1 we show a @xmath6 long region of the cluster spectrum , which has been background subtracted for display purposes . the primary target , the x - ray source hereafter denoted star k , is clearly visible at the top .",
    "two other objects , labeled stars 1 and 2 , are visible .",
    "no other objects are discernible in the entire long - slit spectrum , including the region not shown in fig",
    "the extracted spectrum of star 1 , binned @xmath7 to 1.17 per bin , is displayed in fig .",
    "strong , broad emission lines of n v @xmath81238,1242 , si iv @xmath81394,1403 and/or o iv ] @xmath91401 , c  iv  @xmath81548,1550 , and he ii @xmath91640 are clearly detected .",
    "the o i @xmath91304 feature is most likely imperfectly subtracted geocoronal emission .",
    "the location of a few other common emission lines which may contribute to this spectrum are also marked .",
    "the continuum is very weakly detected at @xmath10 erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 @xmath12 .",
    "this spectrum is that of a classical cataclysmic variable in a quiescent state ( e.g. , wu et al . 1992 ) .",
    "we show in  3 that both the optical and uv magnitudes of the object agree with those expected for a cv at the distance of the cluster , and the probability of a chance superposition of a non - member within @xmath13 of the cluster core is small .",
    "we conclude that we have serendipitously discovered a cv in the cluster .",
    "we have attempted to independently verify cluster membership via radial velocity measurements of the spectrum , but the results are inconclusive .",
    "we were forced to use an undesirably large slit width due to potential problems in target acquisition in this complex field , and the resulting configuration is poorly suited for absolute velocity determinations . if we accept the nominal calstis wavelength calibration , the inferred radial velocity , obtained from several strong emission lines , is @xmath14 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the uncertainty in this value is however dominated by the zero point error introduced by the unknown location of the object within the slit , which could be as large as @xmath15 km s@xmath12 , so the constraint is not meaningful .",
    "further , we expect the radial velocity of the star to vary , with unknown period and probably large amplitude , and so can not make a cogent estimate of the mean velocity after one observation . we have also searched for radial velocity variations from orbit to orbit , again with inconclusive results due to large uncertainties in the subsets of the data .",
    "the spectrum of star 2 is a flat continuum of @xmath16",
    "erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 @xmath12 , and featureless except for possible detections of the common interstellar absorption lines si  ii @xmath17 , c ii @xmath81334,1335 , and c iv @xmath81548,1551 .",
    "when dereddened , the spectrum and photometry are reasonably well described by a kurucz model ( kurucz 1992 ) of t@xmath18,000  k and @xmath19 .",
    "this is consistent with the properties of the non - flickering `` nf '' objects discussed by cool et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and edmonds et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "we attempt to determine the precise location of the objects seen in our spectroscopic observations by examining archival _",
    "we find f140w and f430w ( pre - costar ) foc images taken on 1992 august 13 which cover this field , as well as wfpc2 images taken on 1994 april 17 and 1994 october 15 , obtained with a variety of filters .",
    "there exist two additional epochs of wfpc2 data , but as this field falls on the lower resolution wide field camera ccds in those observations , they provide no additional useful information",
    ".    given the crowding in the cluster core , determination of which objects are responsible for the observed spectra is not trivial .",
    "based on information in the stis header , the distance of stars 1 and 2 from the bright star k is @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , at a position angle of @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "3 we show 5@xmath235@xmath24 regions of the various foc and wfpc2 images . overlaid are two arcs indicating the calculated radii of these objects from star k ( not present in this field ) .",
    "the nearly horizontal lines indicate the edges of a @xmath4 slit .",
    "therefore , we expect to find the objects responsible for the spectra near the intersections of the arcs and the slit .",
    "residual uncertainty in the slit angle is less than 1@xmath25 and thus not important at this scale .",
    "finally , the figure assumes that star k is centered on the slit .",
    "if star k is in fact shifted slightly in the slit , then the location of the slit we have drawn may be displaced up or down by up to @xmath26 ; the target acquisition scenario employed should place star k very near the center of the slit , however .    in the 1400   foc image , we find a faint object at the expected location of star 2 , and label it star b ( recognizing that the association is hardly guaranteed . ) we find no evidence for any detection at the expected location of star 1 in this f140w image .",
    "examining successively longer wavelength images , we find that star b exhibits uv - excess between the f336w and f439w images , but is hopelessly contaminated by light from neighboring stars at longer wavelengths . at the expected location of star 1 ,",
    "we find a faint star which we label a at f439w and longer wavelengths , although there is no evidence of it at f336w and f140w .",
    "star a is positively detected at multiple epochs as well as multiple wavelengths , although it falls just outside the foc f430w image .",
    "there is also another faint object @xmath27 nw of star a , which is also a plausible candidate .",
    "no small adjustments in slit angle or slit shift yield a better alignment . in the astrometric frame of _ hst",
    "_ image u2as0101 t , the coordinates for star a are @xmath28@xmath29 , @xmath30@xmath31 .",
    "although internally precise , this position has a probable uncertainty of @xmath32 with respect to external frames . based on our estimate of the cluster center in the same image , we find that star a is @xmath33 , or 1.8 core radii , from the center of ngc6624 ( assuming @xmath34 from harris 1996 ) . a detailed discussion of a precise measurement of the cluster center , not relevant to our analysis , is given by king et al .",
    "two radio pulsars are located within @xmath35 of star a ( biggs et al .",
    "1994 ) , but the positions are definitely disjoint , given the quoted uncertainties . in a cluster of @xmath34 , it is perhaps not surprising that multiple interesting but unrelated objects are in such proximity .    in table 1",
    "we present photometry for selected objects in the field .",
    "we use a combination of profile - fitting and aperture photometry to derive these magnitudes . for wfpc2 images , aperture corrections",
    "are taken from table 2(a ) in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995b ) .",
    "the photometric measurements have not been corrected for geometric distortions , nor is any correction for charge transfer efficiency losses ( holtzman et al .",
    "1995b ) applied ; for most of the images , these effects should contribute errors of only a few percent .",
    "we use the photometric zero points for the stmag system from table 9 ( @xmath36 ) in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "approximate @xmath37 measurement uncertainties are also provided in the table .",
    "systematic errors for all magnitudes due to uncertainties in detector performance and absolute calibration are @xmath385% .",
    "magnitude measurements presented here are denoted @xmath39 , where @xmath9 is the filter designation , approximately indicating the central wavelength of the filter in nanometers . in the stmag system ,",
    "zero points are set such that a flat spectrum ( @xmath40 ) source will have identical magnitudes at all wavelengths .    for the foc measurements , we use the calibration provided in the header of the images .",
    "a stsdas _ synphot _ calculation yields a calibration value which differs by @xmath41% .",
    "we use a tiny tim ( krist 1993 ) synthetic profile to determine an aperture correction .",
    "since the f140w images were obtained in an unusual mode and far uv calibration is often difficult in any case , we suspect that the absolute calibration may not be accurate to better than a factor of two .    in order to further check that the associations between stars 1 and a , and stars 2 and b , are plausible , we estimate @xmath42 for stars 1 and 2 at the time of the stis observations by convolving the spectra with the f140w bandpass and integrating the observed flux .",
    "we estimate @xmath43 for star 1 , and @xmath44 for star 2 , and estimate uncertainties of 0.2 mag principally because the spectra do not fully cover the f140w bandpass .",
    "given the various uncertainties in this estimate and foc calibration , the agreement between the stis and foc ( table  1 ) magnitude estimates is excellent . aside from the observed level of excitation in the spectrum ,",
    "the lack of any brighter and/or spatially extended image near the correct location for star 1 provides confirmation that the observed emission spectrum can not be due to a cluster planetary nebula or the background superposition of a low redshift agn .",
    "we conclude that star a is the likely source of the emission line spectrum .",
    "we point out in passing yet another unusual object in the same field .",
    "star c ( table  1 , fig .",
    "3 ) is extremely bright in these f140w images , but a rather faint object in longer wavelength passbands .",
    "when dereddened , the @xmath42 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 measurements are well fit by a kurucz model of t@xmath47,000  k. this temperature is most sensitive to the f140w measurement for which the calibration is poorest . if the foc calibration is adjusted by 0.4 mag such that the foc observed and stis convolved magnitudes are equal for star b , the implied temperature for star c is t@xmath48,000  k. this extraordinary uv excess is noteworthy but otherwise not relevant to the present discussion , except as further evidence of a multitude of exotic objects near the center of this cluster .",
    "our photometry in  2.2 together with the known distance and reddening of the cluster permit a comparison of the luminosity of this object with that of the far better - studied field cvs . adopting @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( harris 1996 )",
    ", our measured @xmath51 implies @xmath19 .",
    "there are now four trigonometric parallaxes for classical field cvs ( harrison et al .",
    "1999 , mcarthur et al .",
    "1999 ) , which collectively imply @xmath52 , similar to the @xmath53 often quoted from much larger samples ( warner 1995 ) . given the uncertainties in our photometry for this faint object in a very crowded field , and our single - epoch measurement of an undoubtedly variable star , the agreement of the inferred luminosity of the new ngc6624 cv with those in the field is gratifying . if the system is strongly magnetic , a possibility we consider below , our observed magnitude is perhaps somewhat brighter than expected from polars in the field , but , again given the uncertainties , not alarmingly so .",
    "we are aware of few if any ultraviolet spectra of globular cluster cvs .",
    "edmonds et al .",
    "( 1999 ) display a low signal - to - noise spectrum of an object in ngc  6397 , where heii @xmath91640 is termed  marginally detected \" in emission by those authors . through absolutely no credit to the current authors , our spectrum is far better exposed .",
    "the prominent heii @xmath91640 emission in our spectrum is deserving of comment .",
    "this line is normally not strong in classical cvs , but is seen in polars .",
    "our spectrum is indeed quite similar to that of am  her in this wavelength range ( greeley et al .",
    "unfortunately the simplest defining spectroscopic characteristic of am  her stars , very strong heii @xmath94686 emission , is not accessible to us .",
    "although little can be inferred from one object , we note that grindlay et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have suggested that magnetic white dwarfs are preferentially produced in globular clusters ( see also grindlay 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "these authors also discuss the issue of possible confusion of the spectra of cluster cvs with those of quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , and those considerations also apply here .",
    "our spectrum does not unambiguously distinguish between the two cases ; for example , the quiescent lmxb cen x-4 ( v822  cen ) shows quite weak heii @xmath94686 ( mcclintock & remillard 1980 ) and little or no @xmath91640 emission ( blair et al . 1984 ) , but aql x-1 ( v1333  aql ) displays strong heii  @xmath94686 in quiescence ( garcia et al .",
    "1999 ) . as more cvs than quiescent lmxbs",
    "are known in clusters , it seems most conservative , but still uncertain , to continue the discussion of cvs . as this object lies only a few arcsec from the brightest x - ray source in any globular cluster , its x - ray properties are as yet unknown , but may be accessible to observations from _",
    "chandra_.    although our detection of the ultraviolet continuum is weak , it is of interest to ask if the observed ultraviolet flux agrees with that expected from the field objects , as we have determined above is the case for the visible band .",
    "if we assume @xmath54 ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) , our observed @xmath55 erg  @xmath11  s@xmath12  @xmath12 corresponds to an extinction - corrected monochromatic luminosity of @xmath56 erg  s@xmath12  @xmath12 . for the quiescent u  gem , for example , @xmath57 erg  @xmath11  s@xmath12  @xmath12 ( wu et al .",
    "1992 , long et al . 1994 , long & gilliland 1999 ) ; this ratio of 30,000 in observed fluxes speaks well to advances in ultraviolet spectroscopic capabilities from the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( _ iue _ ) to the _ hst _ era . adopting @xmath58  pc ( harrison et al . 1999 ) and @xmath59 ( panek and holm 1984 , long & gilliland 1999 ) for u  gem , we infer @xmath60 erg  s@xmath12  @xmath12 for that object .",
    "while this excellent level of agreement is almost surely fortuitous , it reaffirms that the cv in ngc6624 , with the exception of its unusual environment , seems a totally normal cataclysmic .",
    "as various abnormal mass transfer scenarios have been at times invoked to explain the lack of cluster cv outbursts , this agreement is interesting .",
    "there is one previous candidate for a cv in ngc6624 , as discussed by s96 .",
    "the identification was based on the presence of the object on two consecutive _ hst _ images , but its absence in all other observations .",
    "we have recovered the candidate in the archival _ hst _ images , and derive its position as @xmath28@xmath61 , @xmath30@xmath62 using the astrometric header information in _ hst _ image u2kl0406 t .",
    "this position is @xmath63 from star a , and thus this object can not be responsible for our spectrum .",
    "moreover , upon close examination of these data , we find that the radial profile of this object is not compatible with a stellar one .",
    "we suggest it is an image artifact of uncertain origin . in fig .  4 , we show a surface plot of the pixels around this object and a nearby , typical star of similar total counts .",
    "the s96 object has a profile much too sharp as compared with this and other stars .",
    "it is indeed detected in two frames , and thus is not a charged particle hit , but rather probably a group of hot pixels or calibration file defect .",
    "we stress however that the removal of the s96 object from the list of cluster cvs merely _ strengthens _ the primary scientific conclusion of that paper , namely that erupting cvs are remarkably rare in clusters .",
    "we have serendipitously discovered a mass - transfer close binary , presumably with a degenerate companion , close to the core of ngc  6624 .",
    "it is likely that the system is a classical cataclysmic variable , although a quiescent lmxb can not be ruled out .",
    "the situation is a curious inversion of the normal problem in globular cluster observations , where one finds an interesting star but has difficulty obtaining the spectrum due to severe crowding .",
    "we have easily obtained the spectrum , but are uncertain of which object is responsible for the emission , although we advance as a reasonable candidate star  a. the uncertainty in the exact coordinates of the system does not however change the surprising result that an object supposedly so rare has been found accidentally .",
    "the object was found in a single stis long - slit exposure encompassing @xmath64  arcsec@xmath65 at an arbitrary position angle passing quite close to the cluster center .",
    "a hypothetical observing program that included all possible position angles with this slit , thus completely mapping the cluster center to @xmath66 , would cover @xmath67 more area .",
    "tempered by the usual uncertainties of _ a posteriori _ statistics , it seems quite likely that the center of ngc6624 contains several , and possibly many , more cvs of the type we have discovered here . if we now accept that these systems most certainly are present",
    " as has indeed been theoretically expected for some time  then one or more mechanisms which suppress the expected outbursts and/or odd colors , and thus hide globular cluster cvs , must certainly be operative ."
