    "wide importance is now attached to the study of higher dimensional spaces as the arena of physical phenomena . however , as we go beyond spacetime , the topological possibilities introduce a new dimension to the difficulty of attaching physical significance to various manifolds . even at five dimensions , asymptotically flat stationary vacuum",
    "black holes are not unique in the sense that horizons of topology @xmath0 @xcite in addition to @xmath1 @xcite are now known . however , in the simpler static case , it is known that asymptotically flat static vacuum black holes are unique @xcite and given by the tangherlini generalization of the schwarzschild vacuum @xcite .",
    "these uniqueness properties suggest that these solutions represent the natural generalization of the schwarzschild spacetime . however , these are not the only asymptotically flat quasi - static vacua which can be considered  spherically symmetric \" .    here",
    "we are concerned with 5-manifolds which admit only the 2- sphere ( unlike the tangherlini vacua which admit the 3-sphere ) and , in addition , two hypersurface orthogonal killing vectors at least one of which is assumed timelike .",
    "these spaces are widely studied in the literature from various physical approaches @xcite but the approach used here is purely geometrical and the results therefore applicable to any physical approach . the only assumption made , aside from the symmetries stated , is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the 5-dimensional ricci tensor .",
    "to set the notation let @xmath4 represent a killing vector field , @xmath5 and if , for the coordinate @xmath6 is adapted ( @xmath7 ) , represent the associated field by @xmath8 .",
    "if , in addition to ( [ killing ] ) , @xmath4 also satisfies the hypersurface orthogonality condition @xmath9}=0 , \\label{hyper}\\ ] ] write the field as @xmath10 .",
    "the traditional definition of a static region of spacetime is one which admits a timelike @xmath10 .",
    "this terminology is also used here and we distinguish the adapted coordinate @xmath11 via timelike @xmath12 .",
    "the spaces considered here admit an additional hypersurface orthogonal killing vector and we distinguish the adapted coordinate @xmath13 via @xmath14 .",
    "( any internal properties of @xmath13 are therefore of no concern . ) in addition to these symmetries we assume 2-dimensional spherical symmetry .",
    "that is , the spaces can be decomposed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 so that we also have the killing field @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are non - zero constants and the other components of this @xmath4 are zero .",
    "this @xmath4 of course includes @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is independent of @xmath23 and @xmath24 and if @xmath25 we refer to this circumstance as an  origin \" .",
    "with the foregoing symmetries it follows that ( [ ricci ] ) is satisfied by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are non - zero constants , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants ( not both zero ) , @xmath31 ( assumed monotone ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a non - zero constant , @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants restricted by the relation @xmath38 to view ( [ sform ] ) as static we take @xmath39 ( unless otherwise noted ) and to view ( [ sform ] ) as an augmentation of spacetime ( with signature + 2 ) we take @xmath40 . we retain both signs of @xmath27 and",
    "so allow the doubly static cases @xmath41 .",
    "note that the forms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 remain unchanged under the interchange @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the reason for this symmetry here is that the adapted coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath11 are ( prior to setting @xmath39 ) interchangeable .    since the magnitude of @xmath27 ( and of course @xmath28 )",
    "can be absorbed into the scale of @xmath13 ( and @xmath11 ) , the form ( [ sform ] ) would appear at first sight to admit three independently specified constants , in addition to @xmath33 , via ( [ consistency ] ) .",
    "this , however , is not the case as we can , without loss in generality , set @xmath45 thus simplifying ( [ s(b ) ] ) to the form @xmath46 this is shown in the appendix .",
    "there are then only two specifiable parameters ( @xmath33 and @xmath29 or @xmath30 subject to ( [ consistency ] ) with ( [ onehalf ] ) ) .",
    "clearly the form ( [ sform ] ) allows an infinite number of representations given a monotone function @xmath47 subject to the reality of the resultant metric coefficients .",
    "another approach is to assume a form for @xmath48 and solve the differential equation ( [ ss(b ) ] ) .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath49 we obtain the solution given by gross and perry @xcite and davidson and owen @xcite .",
    "similarly , setting @xmath50 we obtain the solution given recently by millward @xcite .",
    "these representations are discussed in a more direct way below .",
    "whereas ( [ ss(b ) ] ) can be solved exactly for a wide variety of choices for @xmath48 , we can of course use @xmath51 as a coordinate and view ( [ ss(b ) ] ) as the required coordinate transformation . with @xmath51 as a coordinate ( [ sform ] ) takes the simple form @xmath52 where now @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 the coefficient in ( [ f(h ) ] ) has been redefined for convenience .",
    "an important aspect of what follows is the distinction , on geometrical grounds , of various members of the solution locus ( [ condition ] ) .      whereas the from ( [ hform ] ) is convenient ( and as is shown below , complete in most cases ) , coordinate transformations bring the spaces into more familiar forms .",
    "for example , with the transformation @xmath56 we obtain the form given by kramer @xcite . similarly , with the transformation @xmath57 we obtain form given by given by gross and perry @xcite ( the notation ( here to there ) is related by @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ) and by davidson and owen @xcite ( the notation ( here to there ) is related by @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ) . the solution given recently by millward",
    "@xcite is a very special case .",
    "it is given by @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "in this section we study the geometric properties of the solutions ( [ hform ] ) .",
    "the various solutions are distinguished in figure [ locus ] via the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "first , however , we discuss the interchange symmetry associated with the solution locus ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "the solution locus ( [ condition ] ) is obviously invariant to the interchange @xmath65 @xcite . to see why , consider the coordinate transformation @xmath66 under the transformation ( [ inversion ] ) we obtain ( [ hform ] ) but with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , in terms of figure [ locus ] , we have the quadrant interchanges @xmath70 and @xmath71 along with the point interchanges @xmath72 and @xmath73 . as a result ,",
    "the form ( [ hform ] ) duplicates all distinct classes of solutions . as a matter of convenience",
    "we continue with this form here but with knowledge of this duplicity .",
    "before the properties of the solutions ( [ hform ] ) are discussed in terms of the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , it is useful to review the general nature of the constant @xmath33 as it is quite distinct from @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this is similar to ( the reciprocal of ) the  mass \" in the four - dimensional schwarzschild vacuum as one might well guess from the other representations discussed above and as we explain in detail below . to see this",
    "let @xmath74 represent the 4 dimensional schwarzschild vacuum ( of mass @xmath75 ) and subject this to a conformal transformation @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a constant .",
    "this , of course , preserves ricci flatness ( in any dimension ) .",
    "it is easy to show that under the transformation ( [ conformal ] ) @xmath78 it is clear from the form ( [ hform ] ) then that @xmath79 plays a role similar to @xmath75 ( using the freedom in the scale of @xmath13 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , however , distinguish the solutions ( [ hform ] ) in a rather different way as we now examine .",
    "as explained above , we refer to @xmath80 as an origin . from ( [ hform ] )",
    "we have @xmath81 so that in all cases @xmath82",
    ". moreover , @xmath83 has a minimum ( @xmath84 ) at @xmath85 which restricts the minima to quadrants @xmath86 and @xmath87 of figure [ locus ] . in quadrant",
    "@xmath86 the minima occur for @xmath88 and in quadrant @xmath87 they exist for @xmath89 . for the exceptional solutions @xmath90 and @xmath91 clearly @xmath92 and for the exceptional solutions @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "properties of @xmath96 are summarized in tables [ tab : regular ] and [ tab : exceptional ] .",
    ".[tab : regular]regular \" solutions [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      for the spaces ( [ hform ] ) there is only one independent invariant derivable from the riemann tensor without differentiation and this can be taken to be @xmath97@xmath98 where @xmath97 is the 5-dimensional weyl tensor .",
    "this is given by @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100    first note that for the exceptional cases @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xmath101 and for the exceptional cases @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath102 in all cases @xmath103 moreover , @xmath104 except for the exceptional cases @xmath90 and @xmath91 for which @xmath105 and @xmath106 except for the exceptional cases @xmath93 and @xmath94 for which @xmath107 .",

    "similarly , the limit ( [ weylsing ] ) shows that in all but the other two cases indicated , the solution ( [ hform ] ) is singular as @xmath109 .",
    "the properties discussed above are summarized in tables [ tab : regular ] and [ tab : exceptional ] .",
    "since , as shown above , @xmath110 and since @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the 5-dimensional riemann tensor , all solutions are ( locally ) asymptotically flat for @xmath113 .      in any subspace",
    "@xmath115 constant it follows from ( [ hform ] ) that @xmath116 only for @xmath117 , that is a subspace of the exceptional solutions @xmath91 and @xmath94 .",
    "these are  black string \" solutions @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath118 where @xmath75 is the usual schwarzschild mass ( as we discuss further below ) . with the aide of table [ tab :",
    "exceptional ] we see that for the solution @xmath91 , @xmath88 covers the static part of the spacetime with @xmath119 and all of the spacetime with @xmath120 for @xmath89 .",

    "( in an analogous way , we can consider any subspace @xmath121 constant with @xmath122 and interchange @xmath90 for @xmath91 , @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 in the foregoing .",
    "the exceptional cases @xmath90 and @xmath93 we call  soliton \" solutions @xcite . )      hypersurfaces of constant @xmath51 in subspaces of constant @xmath13 can be categorized by way of the trajectories they contain . here",
    "we distinguish the spacelike ( @xmath123 ) , timelike ( @xmath124 ) and null ( @xmath125 ) cases where @xmath126 and @xmath127 is tangent to a curve in the hypersurface ( @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is any parameter that distinguishes events along the curve ) . from ( [ hform ] )",
    "we find @xmath130 the nature of the singularities thus categorized are summarized in tables [ tab : regular ] and [ tab : exceptional ] where @xmath131 means @xmath132 if exactly radial ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "write the momenta conjugate to @xmath134 and @xmath21 as @xmath135 and @xmath136 and define the constants of motion @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the null geodesic equation now follows as @xmath139 where @xmath140 for a suitably scaled affine parameter @xmath129 and without loss in generality we have set @xmath141 . in general then the singularities discussed above are  directional \" in their visibility as there exist turning points in @xmath51 . in the ",
    "radial \" case @xmath142 we have @xmath143 whereas ( [ radialnull ] ) can be integrated in terms of special functions , this integration is not needed .",
    "we simply observe that there are no turning points on @xmath144 or on @xmath145 . as a result , only in the exceptional solutions @xmath90 and @xmath91 on @xmath144 and @xmath93 and @xmath94 on @xmath146 are the forms ( [ hform ] ) incomplete and also free of naked singularities in the ranges given @xcite .",
    "it is clear from table [ tab : exceptional ] that the exceptional solutions @xmath90 and @xmath91 are incomplete on @xmath144 and the exceptional solutions @xmath93 and @xmath94 are incomplete on @xmath145 . since there is no geometrical reason to terminate these cases , we consider here simple static extensions . in these cases",
    "( but clearly not in general ) we can consider @xmath147 .",
    "first note that the discussion on asymptotic flatness given above extends to @xmath148 in these cases .",
    "moreover , the results given in table [ tab : exceptional ] extend directly to @xmath147 .",
    "it follows then that the cases @xmath90 and @xmath91 on @xmath149 and @xmath93 and @xmath94 on @xmath150 are singular - free .",
    "however , as we know from the 4-dimensional case , these static extensions can be incomplete .      for the black string solutions @xmath91 and",
    "@xmath94 we can write @xmath151 where @xmath152 is any regular completion of the schwarzschild manifold so the space is no longer static via @xmath12 . if @xmath122 the space remains static via @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath122 for the soliton solutions @xmath90 and @xmath93 we can write @xmath153 where again @xmath152 is any regular completion of the schwarzschild manifold so the space is no longer static via @xmath14 but remains static via @xmath12 .",
    "of course , the past spacelike singularities in @xmath152 render these solutions also nakedly singular , but in a way quite unlike the foregoing .      not all singularities can be considered equally serious . here",
    "we define the geometrical mass associated with spherical symmetry in order to classify the singularities discussed above .",
    "define the quantity @xmath75 via the sectional curvature of the two - sphere @xcite , @xmath154 ( in 4 dimensions the well known effective gravitational mass of spherically symmetric spacetimes is given by ( [ mass ] ) with @xmath155 replaced by @xmath156 . )",
    "it follows from ( [ hform ] ) that @xcite @xmath157 so that in all cases @xmath158 however , only in the exceptional solutions is @xmath75 a constant and then , @xmath159 the properties of @xmath75 in the other solutions are summarized in table [ tab : regular ] . in what follows",
    "we classify the geometrical  strength \" of a singularity on the basis of @xmath75 .",
    "most of the foregoing generalizes in a straightforward way to higher dimensions . for example , at dimension 6 , introducing another hypersurface - orthogonal killing vector @xmath160 , it follows ( retaining the previous notation ) that @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath36 are constants , @xmath163 and ( [ s(h ) ] ) still holds , satisfies @xmath164 as long as the parameters remain on the ellipsoid @xmath165 of particular interest here is the fact that in any subspace @xmath166 constant it follows from ( [ hformsix ] ) that @xmath167 only for @xmath168 . these subspaces are precisely the spaces considered in this paper .",
    "as the foregoing discussion makes clear , solutions on the locus ( [ condition ] ) have quite distinct geometrical properties , and not all of these solutions can be considered equally valid in any physical approach .",
    "for example , solutions in the quadrants 3 and 4 have the strongest possible geometrical singularities at the origin ( @xmath75 diverges at @xmath25 ) , and these singularities are visible throughout the associated spaces for the entire range in @xmath51 . in quadrant 1 for @xmath144 and quadrant 2 for @xmath169 the solutions",
    "not only lack an origin , they have the strongest possible geometrical singularities . in contrast , quadrant 1 solutions with @xmath146 and quadrant 2 solutions with @xmath144 have visible but the weakest possible geometrical singularities at the origin ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "in contrast , the exceptional solutions have quite distinct properties .",
    "solutions @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath146 and solutions @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath144 have naked singularities at the origin but of intermediate strength ( @xmath75 remains finite @xcite ) . only for the solutions @xmath90 and @xmath91 with @xmath171 and the solutions @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath146 are the coordinates used in ( [ hform ] ) incomplete . in these cases",
    "singularities in the non - static extensions are obtained . because of the very distinct properties of the solutions as one covers the solution locus ( [ condition ] ) , the natural conclusion is that the solution ( [ hform ] ) is fundamentally unstable about these exceptional solutions .",
    "that is , the properties of the exceptional black string and soliton solutions are unstable to any metric perturbation . in general ,",
    "if one was to envisage a physical theory in which ( [ hform ] ) was the external geometry of an object collapsing to zero volume , quadrant 1 solutions with @xmath145 ( equivalently quadrant 2 solutions with @xmath144 ) would seem to be the natural choice since their properties are stable ( away from the exceptional solutions ) and have the weakest possible , albeit naked , geometrical singularities at the origin @xcite .",
    "finally , it was pointed out how the spaces considered here can be thought of as subspaces of a higher dimensional ricci - flat manifold of similar type .",
    "this work was supported by a grant from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and was made possible by use of _ grtensoriii _ @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we prove that we can , without loss in generality , set @xmath172 in ( [ sform ] ) thus simplifying ( [ s(b ) ] ) to the form ( [ ss(b ) ] ) .",
    "we include @xmath28 for completeness .",
    "define @xmath173 so that @xmath174 next , define @xmath175 by @xmath176 with these definitions ( [ sform ] ) transforms as follows : @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 where @xmath180 and finally @xmath181 thus , with the relabelling @xmath182 and the removal of the @xmath183 , we obtain a space equivalent to the form ( [ sform ] ) but with @xmath172 .
