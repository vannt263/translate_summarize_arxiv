    "anisotropic flow @xmath0 , in particular elliptic flow @xmath1 , is one of the most important observables of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to devise the best possible methods to analyze it .",
    "a good measurement should be reproducible ; in particular , it should be done in such a way that one can easily compare results from different experiments , using different detectors . for the sake of comparison with theory ,",
    "an ideal measurement is a well - defined quantity that corresponds to a generic property of the system , closely related to an interesting theoretical concept .",
    "any such measurement is superior to one that lacks these traits .    in this paper",
    ", we argue that the traditional event - plane method  @xcite , which is still used by most of the major experimental collaborations  @xcite does not satisfy any of the above requirements defining a good measurement .",
    "when the method was first developed , it was assumed that event - by - event fluctuations in @xmath0 were negligible .",
    "however , it is now known that @xmath0 fluctuates significantly within a class of events  @xcite . as a result",
    ", an event - plane measurement of @xmath0 yields an ambiguous measure lying somewhere between the event - averaged mean value @xmath2 and the root - mean - square value @xmath3  @xcite . where exactly depends on the `` resolution '' , which strongly depends on the experimental setup .",
    "this means that , e.g. , the same pb - pb collisions at the lhc yield a systematically different value of @xmath0 depending on whether they are analyzed by alice , cms or atlas , and that comparisons to earlier measurements from lower energy collisions at rhic are ambiguous .",
    "the difference is typically of a few percent for elliptic flow  @xcite , but is larger for higher harmonics like triangular flow @xmath4  @xcite , which is solely due to fluctuations .",
    "fortunately , there exist alternative analysis methods that do not suffer from this ambiguity , such as the two - particle cumulant method  @xcite or a slight variant of the traditional event - plane method called the scalar - product method introduced by the star collaboration  @xcite .",
    "these make for a superior measurement because they consistently yield the rms value of @xmath0 , while introducing no disadvantage compared to the traditional event - plane measurements . supplemented by higher order cumulant measurements ,",
    "these make traditional event - plane measurements completely redundant , as they contain no independent information about the underlying flow .",
    "traditional event - plane analysis methods have also been used to measure higher - order , mixed - harmonic correlations  @xcite .",
    "these measurements also suffer from similar biases as traditional event - plane @xmath0 measurements , but in this case they are much larger  @xcite , causing significant problems even for qualitative comparisons .",
    "fortunately , these problems can be repaired with a few simple changes .    in secs .",
    "[ s : flowvector ] and  [ s : subevents ] , we recall the principle of the traditional event - plane method and of its variant , the scalar - product method . in sec .  [ s : flowfluctuations ] , we show that the former yields an ambiguous measurement in the presence of flow fluctuations , while the latter yields an unambiguous result .",
    "these results are already known to experts  @xcite . for purposes of illustration",
    ", we make several simplifications compared to what is typically done in an experiment , and in sec .",
    "[ s : details ] discuss these complications and why they do not change the results .",
    "we also describe in sec .",
    "[ s : combining ] a new , systematic way of improving the accuracy of the scalar - product method by combining reference flows from `` subevents '' . in sec .",
    "[ s : correlations ] , the discussion is extended to the analysis of mixed correlations , where we show for the first time that the ambiguity resulting from flow fluctuations is much larger , and the proposed corrected procedure is therefore critical .",
    "the picture underlying anisotropic flow measurements is that , if the system exhibits strong collective behavior ( i.e. , `` flow '' ) , particles in each event are emitted independently according to an underlying one - particle probability distribution  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the azimuthal direction of an emitted particle , @xmath0 is the amplitude of anisotropic flow in the @xmath7th harmonic , and @xmath8 the corresponding reference angle .",
    "further assumptions underlying most analyses are that @xmath8 represents a global angle that depends little on pseudorapidity and transverse momentum , that event - by - event fluctuations of @xmath0 also depend little on pseudorapidity and transverse momentum , and that multiplicity fluctuations within a centrality bin are negligible",
    ".    experiments typically detect anywhere from a few hundred particles to at most a few thousand in a given collision event , while the anisotropy coefficients @xmath0 are typically a few percent or less .",
    "a precise reconstruction of the underlying probability distribution is therefore impossible in a single event .",
    "information about the underlying probability distribution can only be extracted from ( azimuthally symmetric ) correlations between outgoing particles , averaged over a large ensemble of events  @xcite .",
    "the various experimental estimates of @xmath0 have compact expressions in terms of the flow vector @xmath9 in harmonic @xmath7 . for a given set of @xmath10 particles belonging to the same event",
    ", one defines @xmath11 by  @xcite latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{defqvector }     where the sum runs through the set of @xmath10 particles with respective azimuthal angles @xmath13 .",
    "the flow vector can also be written in complex form @xmath14    the original idea behind the event - plane method is that the direction @xmath15 of the flow vector in a reference detector provides an estimate of the corresponding angle @xmath8 in the underlying probability distribution  @xcite . because a finite sample of particles is used , statistical fluctuations cause @xmath15 to differ from @xmath8 .",
    "this dispersion is characterized by the `` resolution '' , defined as : @xmath16 where angular brackets denote an average over events . note that this average is real by parity symmetry , except for irrelevant statistical fluctuations .",
    "when the method was developed , it was assumed that dynamical fluctuations of the underlying probability distribution are negligible , so that @xmath0 is the same for all events .",
    "we then rewrite eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) as @xmath17 where @xmath18 indicates an average over a large number of events with the same underlying @xmath0 , the dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath0 can be easily understood if one sees eq .",
    "( [ defqvector ] ) as a directed random walk : particles are emitted randomly , but the underlying probability distribution ( [ prob ] ) is anisotropic .",
    "the resolution @xmath19 thus depends on the relative magnitude of the anisotropy @xmath0 to the statistical dispersion @xmath20 . in the limit @xmath21 ( infinite number of particles )",

    "the value is somewhere in between these limits .",
    "analytic formulas can be obtained for @xmath28 under rather general assumptions ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 )  @xcite , but they are of little practical use except when combining subevents",
    ".    this nonlinear dependence of the resolution on the underlying flow is the origin of the difficulties of the event - plane method , which arise when flow fluctuations are considered .",
    "a simpler quantity is the projection of the flow vector onto the underlying direction @xmath8 , which directly gives the underlying flow : @xmath32 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) .",
    "historically , the most common way to access information about the coefficients @xmath0 has been so - called event - plane measurements . in these analyses , @xmath0 is extracted from correlations between particles of interest ( e.g. , identified particles in a narrow transverse momentum window ) and a different set of particles in a reference detector ( e.g. , unidentified particles in a large @xmath33 range ) , typically separated by a gap in pseudorapidity  @xcite .",
    "the event - plane method thus correlates the flow vector of particles of interest , denoted by @xmath34 , with the direction of the flow vector in a reference detector @xmath35 , denoted by @xmath36 . assuming that the only correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath36 is that resulting from their correlation with the direction of anisotropic flow @xmath8 , this correlation factorizes : @xmath37 where we have used eqs .   and , and @xmath38 denotes the value of @xmath0 in the reference detector @xmath35 .",
    "the resolution @xmath39 is estimated by correlating @xmath35 with additional separate reference detectors ; each reference detector is called a `` subevent '' . in the simplest case of two identical subevents ( @xmath35 , @xmath40 ) located symmetrically around midrapidity , making use of the factorization hypothesis : @xmath41 where we have again used eq .  .",
    "the event - plane measurement is thus defined as @xmath42 since it is impossible to select events according to the underlying probability distribution , the measurement is taken with averages over all events in a centrality class , denoted by unadorned angular brackets . in the absence of flow fluctuations ( i.e. , if the underlying @xmath0 is the same in every event ) , eqs .   and",
    "ensure that @xmath43 coincides with the underlying @xmath0 , up to experimental errors .    a slight variant of the event - plane method consists in removing the factors of @xmath44 before taking the average in the numerator and denominator of eq .  .",
    "@xmath45 the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ defvnsp ] ) involves a scalar product of two vectors @xmath46 , and so is referred to as the scalar - product method  @xcite . in the absence of flow fluctuations , factorization again applies : @xmath47 and similarly @xmath48 therefore @xmath49 also coincides with the underlying @xmath0 in the absence of flow fluctuations .      however , it is now known that @xmath0 fluctuates significantly from event to event  @xcite . to make it clear what is really measured in this case , we evaluate event averages in two steps , by first averaging over events with the same @xmath0 , then combining bins of @xmath0 .",

    "we model flow fluctuations by assuming @xmath58 in each event , where @xmath59 is the anisotropy of the initial distribution in the corresponding harmonic , defined as in ref .",
    "the value of @xmath59 in each event is obtained from the phobos monte carlo glauber model  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath4 , the ratio is close to @xmath60 , corresponding to gaussian fluctuations  @xcite . ]    in general , the event - plane method yields a result which may lie anywhere between the two limits and .",
    "the exact measured quantity depends the detector acceptance  even after the resolution correction is applied  so that the measurement is ambiguous .",
    "the difference between the two limits ranges from 6 to 13% , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] . as the field enters an era of precision physics , comparisons of different experimental analyses  @xcite and of theory to experiment  @xcite are significantly complicated by this dependence on analysis details .",
    "for example , the large detector acceptance and high multiplicities of recent measurements at the lhc allow for a larger resolution than was available at rhic .",
    "the natural choice ( and what has been done ) is to take advantage of this extra resolution to minimize the statistical uncertainty of the measurement .",
    "the penalty , however , is that comparisons to earlier measurements become ambiguous , and one has difficulty determining from these measurements how much the flow changes , e.g. , with collision energy .",
    "theoretical comparisons are hampered for the same reason .",
    "theorists have access to more information than experiments  their ` detectors ' have perfect efficiency and suffer no dead spots or holes in coverage ; i.e. , they can see all particles that are produced .",
    "however , if they succumb to the temptation to make use of this extra information to improve statistics ( or they simply lack detailed information about detector performance to appropriately degrade the data ) comparisons to measurements can become ambiguous and unreliable  even if they otherwise follow the exact same procedures as the experiment  @xcite .    fortunately , this ambiguity can be removed by using the scalar - product method .",
    "although it was originally introduced for unrelated reasons , it gives a well - defined measurement in the presence of flow fluctuations  @xcite , despite differing only trivially from the traditional analysis .",
    "when @xmath0 fluctuates , we again apply the decomposition to eq .   and evaluate the numerator and the denominator using eqs .   and :",
    "@xmath61 where we have again used the hypothesis that @xmath56 does not fluctuate significantly .",
    "therefore , the scalar - product method always yields the root - mean - square @xmath0 , regardless of the details of the analysis , and makes for a superior measurement .    one can also choose to measure a two - particle correlation  @xcite , which is essentially equivalent to a scalar - product analysis , and also always measures this same unambiguous root - mean - square value  @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that even when an event - plane - type analysis is preferred for practical reasons , only a trivial change to the standard analysis is required in order to obtain a well - defined observable .",
    "if the resolution is large enough , higher - order cumulants  @xcite can be analyzed .",
    "these then yield an unambiguous measurement of higher - order , even moments of the distribution of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "since a standard event - plane method measures a quantity that is different from any of these individual observables , one might naively think it useful to perform both analyses in order to obtain the maximum amount of independent information .",
    "however , it has been proven  @xcite that the event - plane method , in addition to being ambiguous , contains no independent information beyond that contained in the first two cumulants , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( regardless of whether nonflow correlations are present in the system ) .",
    "so there is no reason to use a standard event - plane method in any future analysis .",
    "actual measurements often differ slightly from the above idealized discussion .",
    "the flow vector   is typically defined  @xcite without the normalization factor @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the numerators in eqs .   and   are calculated as a sum over the particles of interest in all events , before normalizing by the total number of particles after the sum over events . thus , there are weighting factors of @xmath10 and @xmath65 , respectively , inside the event averages , which become important only if large enough centrality bins are used such that multiplicity and spectrum fluctuations are significant .",
    "second , the flow vector used to estimate the event plane is often calculated as a weighted average of particles .",
    "in particular , if it is measured using a calorimeter , the particles are weighted according to their energy , while a @xmath33-dependent weight is often used to increase the resolution or to remove non - flow correlations  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath38 above refers to a weighted average .",
    "third , in the case where identical subevents are not available , the analysis can be done with three arbitrary subevents @xmath35 , @xmath40 , and @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "one then does the following replacement @xmath67 in the denominator of eq .  , and a similar modification in the resolution correction of eq .  .",
    "fourth , we have used a complex notation throughout this section .",
    "however , all quantities are real after averaging over events , except for irrelevant experimental errors . therefore @xmath68 should be replaced by @xmath69 everywhere .    finally , if any of the flow vectors in the numerator of eqs .   and",
    "are calculated from the same or overlapping sets of particles , care must be made to remove self - correlations  @xcite .",
    "we end this section with a brief description of how the precision of the scalar - product method can be improved beyond previous implementations .",
    "since at least two reference detectors @xmath35 and @xmath40 are needed in order to carry out the flow analysis , it is tempting to combine the information from both detectors into a single measurement with reduced statistical uncertainty . in the standard event - plane method",
    ", this can be done for identical subevents at the expense of additional hypotheses and algebraic complications @xcite , but there is no known way of recombining non - identical subevents , as in the three - subevent method .    with the scalar - product method ,",
    "combining measurements from two reference detectors @xmath35 and @xmath40 is straightforward , even if they are not identical .",
    "one simply measures @xmath0 independently with respect to @xmath35 and to @xmath40 . by linearity of the scalar product , combining both measurements ( denoted by @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) amounts to taking a weighted average .",
    "we show in appendix [ s : appendix ] that the optimal weighting is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the dimensionless resolution parameter . for identical subevents ,",
    "@xmath0 is the mean of @xmath70 and @xmath71 by symmetry : @xmath74 for non - identical subevents , a third subevent @xmath66 is required in order to determine the resolution parameter : @xmath73 is given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 is given obtained through the substitution @xmath77 in eq .  .",

    "much additional information is contained in mixed correlations between different harmonics  @xcite , which give information about event plane angles @xmath8 and will likely play a large part in upcoming measurements . before rushing into analysis , it is important to define observables for good measurements , which will allow unambiguous comparison between different experiments , and with theory .",
    "the atlas collaboration has recently released preliminary measurements of an extensive set of correlations between event planes using traditional methods  @xcite . for illustration",
    ", we consider the first of these correlations .",
    "it is a correlation between the event planes @xmath82 and @xmath83 , namely , @xmath84 , which is then divided by a resolution factor in order to unravel the correlation between the underlying reference directions @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "they thus write : @xmath87 this equation is based on the same hypotheses as the event - plane method , which fail if @xmath1 and @xmath79 fluctuate .",
    "specifically , the numerator of the right - hand side does not factorize into @xmath88 , and the resolution corrections estimated using standard procedures do not actually correspond to @xmath89 and @xmath90 .    using the notations introduced in the previous section , and assuming symmetric subevents @xmath35 and @xmath40 for simplicity",

    "<S> we argue that the traditional event - plane method , which is still widely used to analyze anisotropic flow in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions , should be abandoned because flow fluctuations introduce an uncontrolled bias in the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> instead , one should use an alternative , such as the scalar - product method or cumulant method , which always measures an unambiguous property of the underlying anisotropic flow and therefore eliminates this bias , and does so without any disadvantages . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that this correction is important for precision comparisons of traditional @xmath0 measurements requiring better than a few percent accuracy . </S>",
