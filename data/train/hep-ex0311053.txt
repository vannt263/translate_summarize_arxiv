    "the branching fractions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 belong to a small set of measurable quantities that have a precise and unambiguous relation to the fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) . due to the large top mass , the decays @xmath2 are sensitive to the product @xmath3 of the ckm elements that quantify @xmath4 and @xmath5 transitions . in terms of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) that represents the ckm matrix in the complex plane ,",
    "the height is proportional to @xmath6 and the length of one side is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "the observation of these decays and their branching fractions is the goal of four experiments at hadronic machines : e787 , e949 , ckm ( @xmath0 ) and kopio ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "the probability that the two candidates are due to background is 0.02% .",
    "these observations imply @xmath9  @xcite which is statistically consistent with the sm prediction of @xmath10  @xcite albeit with a central value tantalizingly twice the expectation .",
    "a schematic of the e787 detector is shown in figure  [ fig : e787.det ] . a @xmath11 beam with @xmath12 passes through threshold cherenkov counters , wire chambers , a degrader and a plane of hodoscopes before stopping in a scintillating fiber target .",

    "pure csi detectors @xmath18 thick perform a similar function in the end caps .",
