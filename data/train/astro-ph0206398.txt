    "dense molecular matter is considered to play various roles in the vicinity of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the presence of dense and dusty interstellar matter ( ism ) , which obscures the broad line regions in agns , is inevitable at a few pc - a few 10 pc scale according to the unified model of seyfert galaxies .",
    "this circumnuclear dense ism could be a reservoir of fuel for nuclear activity , and also be a site of massive star formation . in order to investigate dense molecular matter in the centers of seyfert galaxies",
    ", we have conducted an imaging survey of co(1@xmath00 ) , hcn(1@xmath00 ) , and hco@xmath1(1@xmath00 ) lines in nearby seyfert galaxies using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) .",
    "high resolution hcn observations of seyfert galaxies are of interest because unusually strong hcn emission has been reported in the type-2 seyfert galaxies ngc 1068 ( jackson et al .",
    "1993 ; tacconi et al .",
    "1994 ; helfer & blitz 1995 ) and ngc 5194 ( kohno et al .",
    "the hcn / co integrated intensity ratios in brightness temperature scale , @xmath2 hereafter , within the central @xmath3 a few 10 pc region exceed 0.4 , which _ is never observed in non - seyfert galaxies _ including nuclear starburst galaxies ( @xmath4 ; see kohno et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "figure 1 shows a part of the co images of seyfert galaxies obtained with the nma so far .",
    "some seyfert galaxies have also been observed using the rainbow interferometer , which is a 7 elements combined array consisting of six 10 m dishes ( nma ) and nro 45 m telescope ; see sofue et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for ngc 3079 , and see okiura et al .",
    "( 2001 , this volume ) for ngc 7469 .",
    "these co images show a wide variety of gas morphologies in the central kpc regions of seyferts , just as in the case of _ normal _ spirals ( sakamoto et al .",
    "single dish co surveys aiming to determine the global amount of molecular gas in seyferts have revealed that there is no significant difference between the _ total _ amounts of molecular gas in seyfert and quiescent spirals ( e.g. , vila - vilar et al .",
    "our higher angular resolution co images may already suggest that the accumulation of molecular gas in the central kpc region is still insufficient for seyfert activity .",
    "figure 2 shows the hcn and hco@xmath1 images of seyfert galaxies . except for ngc 5194 and ngc 6951 , hcn and hco@xmath1 lines",
    "were observed simultaneously , thanks to the wide ( 1024 mhz ) band width of a new spectro - correlator ( uwbc ; okumura et al .",
    "this enables us to measure hcn / hco@xmath1 ratios ( @xmath5 ) accurately ( systematic error must be less than a few % ) .",
    "we find significant enhancement of hcn toward the nucleus of the type-1 seyfert galaxy , ngc 1097 ( storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "as demonstrated in figure 3 and 4 , the @xmath2 in the center of ngc 1097 is enhanced up to 0.34 .",
    "this is the 3rd detection of abnormally ( @xmath6 ) enhanced hcn after ngc 1068 and ngc 5194 .",
    "we have already mapped another 4 seyferts ( ngc 3079 , ngc 6764 , ngc 6951 , and ngc 7469 ) .",
    "we therefore find that 3 seyferts out of 7 show extreme enhancement of hcn based on our preliminary data .",
    "another intriguing point is the remarkable weakness of hco@xmath1 emission in ngc 1068 and ngc 1097 ; in figure 2 , we find that @xmath5 is 2.3 and 2.1 in ngc 1068 and ngc 1097 , respectively .",
    "the ratios decrease to about unity in the circumnuclear starburst region .",
    "preliminary results of hco@xmath1 in m51 also show very weak hco@xmath1 ( @xmath7 ; shibatsuka et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we have observed extremely strong hcn emission in 3 seyferts out of 7 . what is the nature of these `` hcn - enhanced seyferts '' ?",
    "here we compare the observed line ratios in seyferts with those in nuclear starburst galaxies , which were also measured with similar angular resolutions . in figure 5 , it is immediately evident that seyferts without abnormal hcn enhancements , i.e. ngc 3079 , ngc 6764 , and ngc 7469 , show @xmath2 and @xmath5 values just comparable to those in nuclear starbursts ; they have @xmath2 less than 0.3 , and @xmath5 ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 .",
    "on the other hand , hcn - enhanced seyferts , i.e. ngc 1068 and ngc 1097 , also have very high @xmath5 values ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "note that nguyen - q - rieu et al .",
    "( 1992 ) reported a very high @xmath5 in ngc 3079 and maffei 2 ( @xmath9 ) , yet our new simultaneous measurements gave moderate ( @xmath10 ) ratios .",
    "we propose that these two groups in our `` hcn diagram '' ( figure 5 ) can be understood in terms of `` agn - nuclear starburst connection '' ( note that this should not be confused with `` agn - starburst cohabitation '' , which often refers to the association of agn with star formation on galactic scales in agn hosts ) . in the seyferts with line ratios comparable to those in nuclear starburst galaxies",
    ", it seems likely that nuclear starburst ( presumably in the dense molecular torus ) is associated with the seyfert nucleus ( i.e. , `` composite '' ) . in the nuclear regions of composite seyferts , hco@xmath1 fractional abundance",
    "is expected to increase due to frequent supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "in fact , in evolved starbursts such as m82 , where large scale outflows have occurred due to numerous sn explosions , hco@xmath1 is often stronger than hcn ( e.g. nguyen - q - rieu et al .",
    "on the other hand , the hcn - enhanced seyferts , which shows @xmath6 and @xmath7 , would host `` pure '' agns , where there is no associated nuclear starburst activity .",
    "in such a condition , the hcn line can be very strong because it has been predicted that fractional abundance of hcn is enhanced by strong x - ray radiation from agn ( leep & dalgarno 1996 ) , resulting in abnormally high @xmath2 and @xmath5 values .",
    "our interpretation is supported by other wavelength data ; for instance , ngc 1068 has been claimed as a pure seyfert ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) , whereas ngc 6764 ( schinnerer et al .",
    "2000 ) and ngc 7469 ( genzel et al .",
    "1995 ) have a composite nature .",
    "we need further analysis to validate the proposed interpretation , but if it is the case , this will serve as a new way to investigate the nature of agns ; although this technique requires high angular resolution observations in order to avoid contaminations from extended circumnuclear star - forming regions , it has some advantages ( e.g. , not being affected by dust extinction ) ."
