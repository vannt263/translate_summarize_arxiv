    "the recently discovered giant stellar stream to the south of the andromeda spiral galaxy ( henceforth referred to as the ` giant southern stream ' in m31 ) is thought to be debris from the ( ongoing or past ) disruption of a satellite dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "this finding has sparked a series of followup observations @xcite , including those presented in the companion paper by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) , as well as speculations about possible associated objects @xcite .",
    "such extended debris is interesting because the dynamics are relatively simple to model @xcite : the stars in debris streams are dissipationless , so the essential ingredient of these models is simply phase - mixing along a single orbit . as a consequence ,",
    "streams offer a potential goldmine of information about their origins , with constraints on the orbit , mass , and time since disruption of the progenitor object buried in the morphology and kinematics of the debris ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a general discussion of interpreting streams around external galaxies ) .",
    "the best studied example of satellite disruption is the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( discovered by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a satellite of our own milky way galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of observational work ) .",
    "models for the sagittarius dwarf s debris have not only told us about its own history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also offered insights into the shape of the milky way s potential @xcite .",
    "information extracted from debris around other galaxies is in general much more limited because the data sets are usually restricted to surface photometry , with no practical way to measure distance or velocity variations .",
    "the m31 stream is the first example of debris around another galaxy that can be studied in more detail because it is close enough that",
    "the individual giant stars can be resolved , distances estimated from the tip of the red giant branch @xcite , and velocities obtained from spectra ( paper  i ; * ? ? ?",
    "such studies have already led to specific estimates of the orbit of the progenitor , and limits on m31 s mass @xcite .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the nature of the progenitor is now possible with recently acquired data on the width and the velocity dispersion of the stream .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the constraints on the orbit of the progenitor (  [ sec : orb ] ) , estimate what limits can be placed on its mass (  [ sec : width ] ) , and which m31 objects ( and other low - surface - brightness features ) could be plausibly associated with the stream , given these estimates (  [ sec : disc ] ) .",

    ", these data are used to set up the initial conditions and to serve as additional constraints for our orbit integration .",
    "our own observations ( paper  i ) provide two important constraints on the orbit of the giant southern stream :    * the mean radial velocity in the field  ` a3 ' is @xmath40  km  s@xmath41 relative to the sun which translates to @xmath42  km  s@xmath41 with respect to m31 .",
    "* the position - velocity data provide a measure of the velocity gradients both along the stream and perpendicular to it : @xmath43  km  s@xmath41  arcmin@xmath41 and @xmath44  km  s@xmath41  arcmin@xmath41 , respectively .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty , however , in the determination of these slopes due to possible confusion between stream stars and those in the smooth m31 halo as well as small number statistics .",
    "our data are complemented with information from a few other studies :    * @xcite have estimated line - of - sight distances as a function of sky position for several fields along the giant southern stream .",
    "these imply that the stream sweeps from over 100  kpc behind m31 at the point furthest from the disk in the south ( field 1 ) to 30  kpc in front of the disk in the north ( field  ` 13'see table [ tab : ic_data ] for a summary ) .",
    "* @xcite and @xcite find that the southernmost tip of the stream is nearly at rest with respect to m31 ( i.e. ,  moving at the systemic velocity of m31 ) , whereas the stream in the vicinity of the disk reaches a radial velocity of about @xmath28  km  s@xmath41 with respect to m31 .",
    "this difference of about 165  km  s@xmath41 in radial velocity between fields  ` 1 ' and ` 6 ' , subtending about @xmath45 across the southern part of the stream ( see fig",
    ".  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implies a velocity gradient of @xmath46  km  s@xmath41arcmin@xmath41 , in rough agreement with the observed value within our field  ` a3 ' ( see fig .",
    "8 of paper  i ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : obs_constr1 ] illustrates the positional data of the giant southern stream fields and of m31 s satellite galaxies .",
    "the spatial and velocity information together offer a general picture of the dynamics of the stream .",
    "the southern part of the stream is located behind the disk ( as seen from our location ) and is travelling generally towards m31 along almost a straight line path , with an inclination of about @xmath47 with respect to the line of sight @xcite  this implies that the orbital plane must be inclined by at least @xmath48 to the plane of the sky and can not be face on .",
    "indeed , the linearity of the stream in the sky and its proximity to the center of m31 in field  ` 8 ' suggests that the inclination is used to denote the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky .",
    "an inclination angle of @xmath49 corresponds to the case in which the normal vector @xmath50 to the orbit  defined by the direction of the total angular momentum of the orbit  is oriented towards the observer .",
    "] of the orbital plane is closer to @xmath51 ( i.e. ,  edge on ) since any curvature of the orbit would otherwise be apparent .",
    "in addition , the strong velocity and distance gradients along the stream and the large range in measured separations from m31 along the stream indicate that the orbit is eccentric .",
    "lastly , the linearity of the stream suggests that its orientation in space corresponds to the direction of motion , with negligible motion perpendicular to it .",
    "hence , the full space velocity relative to m31 can be estimated at each point along the observed stream to be of order @xmath52 . since the southernmost part of the stream has a radial velocity close to zero with respect to m31",
    ", this would imply that this location is near or even coincides with the apocenter of the orbit .",
    "in addition to the above data , there are two  other `` features '' that stand out in the star - count and metallicity maps :    * a high density stellar feature is observed near the northeastern end of the disk major axis @xcite , and is known as the `` northern spur '' .",
    "its metallicity is higher than that of the disk and the neighboring halo .",
    "the origin of this feature is still unknown .",
    "it has been hypothesized to be either part of the giant southern stream or an extension of the disk @xcite . in the latter case , this would imply a very significant warp of the disk .",
    "* the high metallicity feature noted by @xcite immediately to the south of the northeastern half of the disk . surprisingly , the metallicity of this feature is comparable to that of the giant southern stream .",
    "it also appears to be higher than the overall metallicity of the northern spur ( see fig .  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although we caution that it is possible that a similar high - metallicity component may be present in the northern spur but may be hard to disentangle from the large number of typical ( i.e. ,  lower metallicity ) halo stars in the region .",
    "since it lies more or less east of m31 s center , we refer to it as the `` eastern high - metallicity feature '' .",
    "the peculiarities of these two  features raise the question of whether they may be related to the orbit of the giant southern stream .",
    "unfortunately , no distance or velocity measurements are available yet for either of these features and they are therefore not included as constraints in the orbit integrations . however",
    ", their possible connection with the stream , as inferred from our orbit integrations , is discussed later in the paper (  [ sec : impl ] ) .",
    "we now integrate test particle orbits in a static m31 potential in order to find the general characteristics of those that could be consistent with the data summarized in table [ tab : ic_data ] .",
    "the form of the potential contains three components : a dark halo ,    @xmath53    a @xcite disk ,    @xmath54    and a @xcite bulge ,    @xmath55    for the parameters in relations ( [ eqn : pothalo])([eqn : potbulge ] ) , we adopt the same values that @xcite used to obtain a reasonable fit to the m31 data : @xmath56  kpc , @xmath57  km  s@xmath41 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 kpc , @xmath60 kpc , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 kpc . with these parameters the rotation speed reaches 260 km  s@xmath41 at a radial distance of 26 kpc , in good agreement with the observations of m31 ( e.g. ,",
    "* ) and with the recent global mass constraint derived by @xcite .",
    "note that relation ( [ eqn : pothalo ] ) assumes that there is no flattening of the halo potential .",
    "present observational data are insufficient to probe the extent to which the m31 halo may be flattened . however ,",
    "given that the stream data are confined to less than one orbital period , we expect the effects of weak or moderate flattening to be minimal ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    throughout the remainder of this paper ,",
    "we denote with @xmath63 the coordinates in the plane of the sky [ aligned with angular coordinates @xmath64 and @xmath65 along the line of sight .",
    "the orbit integrations are performed in a coordinate system having two axes aligned with m31 s disk ( denoted @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) and the third one , @xmath68 , perpendicular to the disk .",
    "we choose to start our orbit integrations from a location near the center of the giant southern stream , where both spatial and velocity data are available .",
    "thus , we choose field  ` 5 ' as starting point and assign to it the radial velocity found in the neighboring field  ` a3 ' , @xmath69  km  s@xmath41 ( this choice is reasonable due both to the proximity of these two fields , and because fig .",
    "8 of paper  i shows that a strong gradient in the direction perpendicular to the stream , @xmath70 , can be ruled out ) .",
    "starting from field ` 5 ' , we then integrate both backward and forward in time .",
    "given the lack of data for the other two components of the velocity , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we decided to construct a grid of orbits in order to constrain this parameter space .",
    "an initial inspection of the overall parameter space shows that orbits which are good fits to the data have initial conditions which cluster in the vicinity of the value @xmath73 km  s@xmath41 .",
    "our final grid consists of @xmath74 orbits , all having a fixed initial radial velocity , @xmath75 km  s@xmath41 and sampling the @xmath76 and @xmath77 plane in steps of 5 km  s@xmath41 around @xmath78 km  s@xmath41 .",
    "all grid orbits are shown in figure [ fig : grid ] with empty square symbols . among these orbits",
    "we need to select those that fit the stream data .",
    "given that stream data may not be an accurate representation for the progenitor data ( streams may deviate significantly from the progenitor s orbit ) , a `` best - fit '' method may not always be relevant .",
    "therefore , we choose to adopt a simple accept - or - reject method by which we consider as acceptable only those orbits that pass within a series of `` boxes '' centered on the stream data and extending in both spatial and velocity dimensions . a reasonable choice for the size of these boxes would be of the order of the measurement uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig : grid ] shows with small filled symbols the orbits accepted based on the criterion : @xmath79  kpc and @xmath80  km  s@xmath41 .",
    "note that we consider boxes only around fields  ` 1'`8 ' , since fields  ` 12'`13 ' are generally difficult to fit ( see a similar discussion by @xcite ) . from the set of acceptable orbits we choose three to illustrate their common characteristics .",
    "these are highlighted in figure  [ fig : grid ] with large symbols .",
    "the large squares represent the two  orbits with extreme inclinations out of the `` acceptable '' set ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) and are denoted from now on as orbits  ` a ' and ` c ' , respectively .",
    "the large hexagon represents an intermediate case ( edge - on to the plane of the sky  i.e . , @xmath83 ) , and is denoted as orbit  ` b ' .",
    "note that orbit  ` b ' satisfies the most stringent conditions : for example , by reducing the box sizes to @xmath84  km  s@xmath41 , the set of acceptable orbits consists of only a few centered around orbit  ` b ' . not surprisingly , the orbits found by us to be good fits to the stream data are similar to the orbits presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sim_orb1 ] shows orbits ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' in more detail : the top and middle panels show the @xmath63 and @xmath85 projections of the stream data and of the orbits ; the bottom panel shows the radial velocity @xmath86 along the orbits compared with the observed values in fields  ` 1 ' , ` 2 ' , ` a3 ' , ` 6 ' , and ` 8 ' , as well as the data on m31 satellite galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : sim_orb2 ] illustrates the three - dimensional positions of the stream fields and of orbit ` b ' in the @xmath87 system of coordinates .",
    "note , we give more weight in our fit to radial velocities than to line - of - sight distances because the latter are more susceptible to systematic errors  e.g . ,  contamination of the tip of the red giant branch region by intermediate - age asymptotic giant branch stars , metallicity effects , etc .. the uncertainty in _ relative _ distance between m31 and the stream fields may be larger than the 20  kpc distance error quoted by @xcite because of differences between the stellar populations of the stream and the central region of the galaxy .",
    "finally , field  ` 8 ' has the weakest contrast of the stream against the main body of m31 and this may be problematical for both distance and radial velocity measurements ( e.g. ,  see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "several orbits provide good fits to the data , a reflection of the limited nature of the observational constraints .",
    "however , we found orbits with a small range of inclinations to the plane of the sky ( @xmath81@xmath82 ) to fit the giant southern stream data well .",
    "all orbits that fit the data share the common characteristics of a fairly high eccentricity and approximately the same apocenter .",
    "these are a consequence of the imposed constraints on the orbit : the measurement of zero velocity ( relative to m31 ) at the southern end of the stream ( field  ` 1 ' ) , coupled with the large range in line - of - sight distances which tells us that the orbit is inclined to the line of sight , imply that field  ` 1 ' must be near apocenter .",
    "this working hypothesis is capable of being further verified or falsified by observations : if it holds true , then the stream , as seen in projection , should turn around on itself at or slightly beyond field  ` 1 ' .    given the spatial and velocity constraints imposed by the data",
    ", we also conclude from inspection of figure [ fig : sim_orb1 ] that :    * it is generally difficult to fit the northern part of the stream ( i.e. ,  fields  ` 12 ' and ` 13 ' ) . in order to fit these fields",
    "one needs a large initial velocity ; however , this would increase the eccentricity and apocenter radius of the orbit rendering it inconsistent with the zero line - of - sight velocity measured in field  ` 1 ' .",
    "* we obtain a sub - set of orbits that pass close to the northern spur feature ( eg . orbit  ` c ' ) .",
    "unfortunately , no velocity measurements are avalaible at the moment in the northern spur in order to confirm or rule out this association .",
    "( note that before full spatial data and any radial velocity were available , @xcite proposed an orbit that appears to match both the stream and the northern spur .",
    "this orbit can now be ruled out because it has a turning point around field  ` 6 ' in the stream , a location which is much closer to m31 than the current detections in field  ` 1 ' .",
    "also , a turning point in field  ` 6 ' implies a close to zero line - of - sight velocity relative to m31 at that location , which is inconsistent with the current velocity measurements in adjacent fields . )    among all orbits that fit the data , the orbit  ` a ' coincides , at least in projection , with the eastern high - metallicity feature .",
    "this feature , located at @xmath88 , @xmath89 in fig .  5 of @xcite , can be either roughly along the post - pericenter part of the orbit or just before the next pericenter of the orbit .",
    "the possible association with either of these two parts of the orbit can be probed only by future velocity measurements in this region .",
    "if the eastern high - metallicity feature and the giant southern stream are indeed associated , we can predict line - of - sight distances and radial velocities along this feature based on the orbit determined in  [ sec : part_orb ] . as can be inferred from figure  [ fig : sim_orb1 ]",
    ", this feature is expected to lie at a distance of @xmath90  kpc from m31 and in front of m31 as seen from our location .",
    "simple intuition tells us to expect debris from more massive satellites to produce wider debris streams that spread more rapidly along the orbit with time .",
    "@xcite present simple analytic scalings for the width and length of debris streams , assuming the progenitor is a hot stellar system . in this section",
    ", we use these ideas to discuss possible limits on the characteristics of the progenitor .    based on their star - count data , @xcite",
    "suggest that the giant southern stream is fanning out towards the southern part of the stream .",
    "numerical simulations show that the stream is indeed expected to fan out towards the apocenter of the orbit ( in this case , towards field  ` 1 ' ) . to test this expectation ,",
    "we have estimated the width of the stream by fitting gaussian functions at various points along the stream to the density count data of @xcite .",
    "these fits are presented in figure  [ fig : sim_gauss ] .",
    "our results do not show a significant outward increase in the standard deviation @xmath91 of the gaussians fitted to the stream , although the counts are so low in the outer fields that we feel this can not yet be ruled out .    given the uncertainties in the other fields",
    ", we estimate the width of the stream containing 80% of the luminosity ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the combined fields  ` 6'`7 ' to be @xmath92 , or , assuming an average distance @xmath93  kpc , @xmath94  kpc ; the combined average distance of these two  fields from the center of the galaxy is @xmath95  kpc .",
    "these parameters can be then used to put some limits on the mass of the progenitor satellite at the time of disruption ( see a similar analysis in * ? ? ?",
    "if the progenitor were a hot stellar system , the measured fraction , @xmath96 , is related to the mass @xmath97 of the satellite through the relation : @xmath98^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "given that @xmath99  km  s@xmath41 and @xmath100 is in the range 3@xmath101@xmath1014.5  kpc for our accepted orbits , one can estimate the mass of the satellite prior to the disruption from which the debris came : @xmath102@xmath103 . from the luminosity of the stream",
    "so far detected , @xmath104 @xcite , this gives mass - to - light ratios of  3.55.2 , which are marginally consistent with those inferred from observations of nearby _ dwarf elliptical _ galaxies .",
    "the low @xmath105 ratio may be indicative of the nature of the progenitor .",
    "however , we caution that this ratio is rather uncertain : the progenitor may not be completely disrupted or the observed luminosity may not be representative for the entire stream , as we have implicitly assumed . also , for a system of similar mass with some rotation , the associated streams would be thinner , in which case these are lower bounds on the mass and mass - to - light ratios of the progenitor .",
    "these derived constraints on the progenitor s properties are similar to those found by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the time @xmath106 taken for the observed debris to spread along the orbit can be estimated from its observed angular extent @xmath107 around the parent galaxy .",
    "@xcite write down an expression , most valid for mildly eccentric orbits , that uses @xmath108 directly as an estimate of the fraction of the orbit covered with debris . since our orbit is highly eccentric",
    "we adapt their equation  ( 5 ) , replacing @xmath108 with @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the time taken to travel @xmath107 along the orbit and @xmath111 is the azimuthal period : @xmath112 from our test particle orbits we find @xmath113  gyr , and hence the time since disruption for the giant southern stream is @xmath114  gyr . in conclusion",
    ", our results suggest that the giant southern stream in m31 is very young ( less than an orbit old ; for this orbit , the azimuthal periods for the accepted orbits are @xmath115  gyr and the radial orbital periods are @xmath116  gyr ) .",
    "this result is also supported by the visual appearance of the stream : the stream is young enough to be plainly visible as an overdensity in star counts @xcite .      in the companion paper ( paper  i ) , the intrinsic line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the giant southern stream in field  ` a3 ' was constrained to be @xmath117  km  s@xmath41 .",
    "what can be inferred from the coldness of the stellar stream ?",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the dispersion in debris should decrease over time .",
    "however , since the giant southern stream is very young , we do not expect dynamical cooling to be significant yet . also , neither has it had time yet to be significantly heated by tidal interactions with dark matter substructure in the halo @xcite .",
    "rather , the velocity dispersion is expected to vary most significantly in an oscillatory manner as a function of radial orbital phase ( a result also obtained by * ? ? ?",
    "based on the orbit determined in ",
    "[ sec : part_orb ] , we can make some general comments about the phase - space dependence of the giant southern stream .",
    "as discussed before , several arguments suggest that the orbit of the stream is highly eccentric .",
    "the orbits presented in figure  [ fig : sim_orb1 ] have apocenter / pericenter ratios ranging @xmath118@xmath10130 . in figure",
    "[ fig : sim_sigma ] we show the result of an @xmath119-body numerical simulation of a stellar stream moving in an orbit of high eccentricity ( @xmath120 ) , as an illustration for the trends expected to occur along eccentric orbits ; this is `` model  4 '' in the numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "the top two  panels of figure  [ fig : sim_sigma ] show the position in the orbital plane of the stellar debris in both the trailing ( left panel ) and leading ( right panel ) portions of the stream .",
    "the middle panels show the distance from the center of the parent galaxy versus azimuthal angle @xmath121 along the stream .",
    "the bottom panels show the radial velocity dispersion ( with respect to the parent galaxy ) in units of the central dispersion of satellite , @xmath122 , versus azimuthal angle @xmath121 along the stream .",
    "note , because the orbital plane of the stream is almost edge on to our line of sight we expect the observed radial velocity dispersion ( i.e. ,  along the line of sight ) for fields  ` 2'`8 ' in the giant southern stream to exhibit similar effects as the radial velocity dispersion with respect to parent galaxy in the simulations .",
    "the parameters are calculated as averages over all particles in uniform bins in @xmath121 .",
    "from figure  [ fig : sim_sigma ] one can infer some general trends about the phase - space evolution of the debris : spikes in @xmath123 , as large as a factor of  45 , occur at the turning points ( pericenter and apocenter ) , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "also , the stream can become very cold in between the turning points with the velocity dispersion of the stream reaching values well below the central dispersion of the satellite , as small as @xmath124 .",
    "these effects are most pronounced for and appear to be generic features of more eccentric orbits ( simulations with less eccentric orbits are not shown here ) .",
    "therefore these results could be even higher for the orbit of the progenitor , given that the orbits found in  [ sec : part_orb ] are even more eccentric than those of our numerical simulations .",
    "our field  ` a3 ' lies between apocenter and pericenter in orbital phase along our fitted orbits , and hence we expect the velocity dispersion of the progenitor to be at least as large as the intrinsic value estimated for the stream , and possibly much greater than this . adopting the nominal best - fit value of 15  km  s@xmath41 from the possible range of stream velocity dispersions ( 023  km  s@xmath41 ) , this implies that the progenitor satellite has a mass of @xmath125 .",
    "this lower bound , admittedly a rough one given the caveats discussed above , is consistent with that set by the width of the debris on the mass of the satellite ( see  [ sec : width ] ) .",
    "future velocity measurements can be used to confirm or rule out our prediction of significant variations of the line of sight velocity dispersion along the giant southern stream .",
    "@xcite do have some velocity measurements in these fields , but not in sufficient numbers to look for this effect ; combining data from fields  ` 1 ' , ` 2 ' , ` 6 ' , and ` 8 ' , they find a concentration of stars with a velocity dispersion of 11  km  s@xmath41 , but with a skewed tail of velocities relative to the center of the stream with a spread much greater than this ( possibly related to m31 s smooth halo population ; see paper  i ) .",
    "from the two  independent mass estimates described above (  [ sec : width_stream ] and  [ sec : cold ] ) we conclude that our progenitor satellite has a mass @xmath126 but this is only a rough lower bound .",
    "this result suggests that the progenitor is a massive dwarf galaxy . in particular",
    ", we note that although the observational data give an upper limit to the velocity dispersion of the stream , the theoretical models show that the stream s velocity dispersion provides only a lower limit to the velocity dispersion of the progenitor .",
    "therefore , the satellite can have a velocity dispersion much larger than 23  km  s@xmath41 .",
    "consistent with this result are the new measurements of the mean metallicity of red giant stars in field  ` a3 ' in the giant southern stream ( paper  i ) : @xmath127\\rangle=-0.5 $ ]  dex . assuming that this value is representative for the satellite as well , and using the empirical metallicity - luminosity relation obtained in the local group @xcite , this would imply an absolute magnitude @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) and mass @xmath130 for the progenitor satellite .",
    "while the metallicity - based estimates of the progenitor mass and luminosity are much greater than the lower bounds obtained from the stream width , luminosity , and velocity dispersion , it should be recognized that those lower bounds are very approximate for the reasons discussed above .",
    "the large discrepancy between the direct estimate of the stream s luminosity @xcite and the progenitor luminosity inferred from our metallicity measurement may have an important implication .",
    "the former estimate corresponds only to the detected part of the stream  the luminosity of the _ entire _ stream may be much higher .",
    "this would suggest that a large portion of the stream or even its progenitor are currently invisible ( or unidentified ) , either because a part of the stream has already faded into the background and/or the surviving portions of the satellite and stream are lost against the disk of m31 .",
    "the recent identification of a high - luminosity feature ( @xmath131 ) along the stream @xcite should caution us that other stream features may still remain undetected .",
    "several satellites that fit these mass and luminosity descriptions are aligned in projection along or in the close vicinity to the giant southern stream .",
    "the velocity information for the debris , which has become available only recently , is useful for ruling out some of these possible associations .    based on our orbit integrations",
    "we can conclude that m32 is unlikely to be associated with the stream .",
    "although m32 has a projected position almost coincident with the stream , its radial velocity has an opposite sign to those of the velocities of the fields in the giant southern stream .",
    "we can therefore exclude any possibility that the stream results from a _ current _ passage of m32 .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the radial velocity plot in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : sim_orb1 ] : the radial velocity starts from field ` a3 ' with a value of @xmath8  km  s@xmath41 and decreases during the first passage ; it becomes positive only in a subsequent passage .",
    "several authors mention the possibility that the observed stream could be a remnant from a previous passage of m32 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we believe that this is also inconsistent with the observations ",
    "if this scenario were true , a stream from the current passage should also be visible , and this is not supported by observations .",
    "ngc  205 is also an unlikely progenitor based on similar velocity arguments , as well as on the fact that its line - of - sight distance does not match our fitted orbits ( see also the result of * ? ? ?",
    "the satellite responsible for the stream should be currently located along the stream .",
    "the satellite can either be one of the surviving satellites around m31 or it could be totally destroyed .",
    "given the relatively young age of the stream , the latter case implies that the satellite in question was destroyed only a short time ago .",
    "the recently discovered and  viii @xcite is an attractive possibility as a progenitor : both its location and radial velocity ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 ; @xmath134  km  s@xmath41 with respect to m31 ) are consistent with those of the giant southern stream and of our determined orbit ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : sim_orb1 ] ) .",
    "future observations need to confirm if and  viii is a satellite galaxy or , as has been recently suggested @xcite , simply a part of the stellar stream .",
    "from a comparison of test particle orbits with observational data we conclude that the progenitor of the m31 giant southern stream was ( or is ) on a highly eccentric , close to edge - on ( to the plane of the sky ) orbit with apo- to peri - center ratio of order  2530 , and an apocenter at or only slightly beyond the edge of the current data . given these accepted orbits we estimate the mass of the progenitor to be @xmath135 from the width of the debris , and the time since disruption to be @xmath136  gyr ( less than one  orbit ) . moreover , @xmath119-body simulations suggest that our line - of - sight velocity dispersion limit of 23  km  s@xmath41 for the stream in field  ` a3 ' is only a lower bound on the dispersion of the progenitor . in conclusion , our analyses lead us to expect that :   ( i )  the stream should turn around slightly beyond the edge of field  ` 1 ' ;   ( ii )  the stream should widen around this turning point and the line -of - sight velocity dispersion should exhibit significant variations along the stream ;   ( iii )  there are possible associations between the post - pericenter part of the stream and the northern spur or the eastern high - metallicity feature . in the latter case ,",
    "this eash high metallicity feature should lie well in front of the disk ; and   ( iv )  the kinematic data on and  viii are consistent with this feature being associated with the orbit of the giant southern stream .    k.v.j .  and a.f.s contributions were supported through nasa grant nag5 - 9064 and nsf career award ast-0133617 .",
