    "simplified models of beams vibrations have interested researchers for decades .",
    "one of the main issues , both from a physical and mathematical point of view for such problems is the question of stabilization of the oscillations when time goes to infinity .",
    "there exist various models of transverse vibrations of beams . here , we focus on a euler - bernoulli ( eb ) like model , which is the most commonly used model because it is simple and provides reasonable engineering approximations .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "however , the standard homogeneous eb equation can be generalized in order to account for inhomogeneity of the material , heat conduction , and dampings ( either viscous , or frictional ) .",
    "let us also mention a model where both transverse and axial vibrations are investigated @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate a model of transverse vibrations , derived from the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be the length of a axially symmetric thin beam , along the axis @xmath3 .",
    "we also suppose that the microbeam is subjected to heat and to a non uniform frictional damping .",
    "then the transverse displacement @xmath4 and the temperature field @xmath5 satisfy the following set of equations ( without dimension ) , for all @xmath6 , for all @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a non negative function describing the non homogeneity of the beam , and @xmath10 , also non negative stands for the force of the frictional damping .",
    "the constants @xmath11 are assumed to be strictly positive .",
    "note that system - is a simplified version of the one investigated in @xcite .",
    "indeed , although we added inhomogeneity and damping , the authors in @xcite consider a more general law of heat conduction and assume the beam is moving along the @xmath3 axis at a constant velocity , and that the temperature is also damped .",
    "moreover the coupling constants are not the same in their case ( here we only have @xmath12 ) , so their problem is more difficult to tackle .",
    "system - is complemented by dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath13 that hold for all @xmath6 , describing a _ clamped _ beam at both ends . and finally we have initial conditions : @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    our purpose in this work is to provide well - posedness of system - under smoothness assumption on the inhomogeneity functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and to investigate the long time behavior of the energy , that is to say wether or not the energy decays exponentially . indeed , the study of the total energy functional @xmath15 , defined , in our case , for all @xmath16 , by @xmath17,\\ ] ] when @xmath18 , answers the question of the stabilization of the vibrations of the structure .",
    "rates of decay for the total energy have been established for various dissipative models , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "up to our knowledge , the exponential stability has not been investigated for our model , and provides a first answer to the stabilization of microbeams under study in @xcite , with of course only the fourier law of heat , and a non moving structure in the @xmath3 direction , for a start . moreover",
    ", our result extends the results of @xcite for inhomogeneous beams without heat , and the ones of @xcite for damped waves coupled with heat .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : semigroup ] we state the mathematical hypothesis and prove well - posedness of the initial boundary value problem - using a semigroup argument . in section [ sec : expo ]",
    "we prove the exponential decay of the energy which is the main result .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : numeric ] we illustrate numerically the exponential decay of the energy by considering a simple finite difference discretization , in the spirit of @xcite and initial conditions close to a physically relevant situation , inspired by @xcite .",
    "in this section , we prove existence and uniqueness of solution to - .",
    "let us start by introducing the main assumptions and notations .      throughout this paper",
    ", we always assume that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are positive definite functions , @xmath21 @xmath22 and that there exist constants @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 such that @xmath27 \\\\ 0<\\alpha_{3}\\leq q(x)\\leq \\alpha_{4},\\quad\\forall\\,x\\in[0,\\,l ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    throughout this paper @xmath28 is a generic constant , not necessarily the same at each occasion(it will change from line to line ) , which depends in an increasing way on the indicated quantities .",
    "we first establish an equality describing the dissipativity property of our system .",
    "[ lemma : energy - equal ] for every smooth enough solution of the system - the total energy @xmath15 , defined by satisfies @xmath29    we multiply , by @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . integrating in @xmath32,$ ] using the boundary condition , summing and taking the real part",
    ", the result follows straightforward .",
    "the equations - can be rewritten as @xmath33 and satisfies @xmath34    let us now introduce the phase space associated to our problem .",
    "we use the standard @xmath35 space , the scalar product and norm are denoted by @xmath36 hence , denote @xmath37 endowed with the inner product given by @xmath38 for @xmath39 @xmath40 and the norm @xmath41 we can easily show that the norm @xmath42 is equivalent to the usual norm in @xmath43 , so that the phase space @xmath43 is a hilbert space .    finally , we have the poincar inequality @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the poincar constant .",
    "+      in order to establish the well - posedness , we reformulate our problem as an abstract cauchy problem . taking @xmath46 the initial boundary value problem -",

    "it is easy to show that @xmath82 for a positive constant @xmath76 therefore we conclude that @xmath83 therefore @xmath59 is the generator of a @xmath84 semigroup of contractions and the proof of theorem [ teo1 ] is complete .",

    "we begin with preliminaries .",
    "we recall the energy equality from lemma [ lemma : energy - equal ] , @xmath90 let us now define an auxiliary function that will help building our lyapunov : @xmath91 we conclude this subsection by a lemma to control the time derivatives of the auxiliary function @xmath92 .",

    "we illustrate our result numerically , considering physically relevant initial conditions , and our result generalizes the results obtained for the wave equation and for eu models without heat .",
