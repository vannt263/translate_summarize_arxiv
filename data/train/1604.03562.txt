    "the hard x - ray imaging by the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) _ satellite @xcite has led to the discovery of a large number of new or previously poorly studied `` igr '' sources .",
    "the most recent published catalogs of 17100kev sources detected by _ integral _ include more than 900 sources for the whole sky @xcite and @xmath2400 sources within @xmath3 of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of the sources have been identified as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , but 23% of the 939 sources listed in @xcite are still unidentified , in part due to the difficulty in finding counterparts at other wavelengths with the @xmath21@xmath44@xmath4 _ integral _ position uncertainties . in an effort to characterize the populations of hard x - ray sources in the galaxy ,",
    "we have been performing follow - up observations of sources in the galactic plane to identify the natures of as many igr sources as possible .    during 20132015",
    ", we observed ten igr sources with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , and the results were reported in @xcite and @xcite . in some cases , the information from the _ chandra _ observation , including accurate source positions that provided optical or ir identifications , immediately led to a determination of the nature of the source .",
    "for example , igr  j04059 + 5416 and igr  j082974250 were identified as agn @xcite , and igr  j180882741 was identified as a cv @xcite .",
    "igr  j140916108 was one of the sources observed in this program , but the _ chandra _ observation did not allow us to definitively determine its nature , and we selected it for further study as described in this work .",
    "igr  j140916108 was discovered when it was detected in the _ integral _ 9-year galactic hard x - ray survey @xcite .",
    "x - ray counterpart was found by @xcite and then the source was observed with _",
    "chandra _ , leading to the detection of a strong iron k@xmath5 emission line in the x - ray spectrum and the identification of an optical / ir counterpart @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ showed that the source has a hard power - law continuum with a photon index of @xmath6 , suggesting an accreting compact object with a high magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "while we favored a magnetic cv , we did not rule out the possibility that the source is an hmxb . in this work ,",
    "we use new x - ray and optical observations to study igr  j140916108 in more detail .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] lists the observations that we used , including simultaneous x - ray observations with the _ x - ray multi - mirror mission ( xmm - newton ) _ and the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar ) _ as well as optical spectroscopy with the very large telescope ( vlt ) and with the southern astrophysical research telescope ( soar ) .",
    "the x - ray observations occurred on 2015 july 20 - 21 , and the observation identifiers ( obsids ) , exact start and stop times , and exposure times are provided in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the x - ray data provide a large improvement in the statistical quality over the previous _ chandra _ and _ integral _ observations to give better constraints on the spectrum and to allow for a sensitive search for periodic signals .",
    "the optical data provide a first look at the spectrum of the source . in the following ,",
    "we describe how the data from each facility were reduced .      for the epic / pn @xcite and epic / mos @xcite instruments",
    ", we reduced the data using the _ xmm _ science analysis software v14.0.0 to make images , light curves , and spectra .",
    "for pn , we made a full - field 1012kev light curve to look for times of high background , and filtered these times out for the final data products .",
    "we followed the same procedure for mos and obtained slightly more time on - source ( 28.9ks for mos compared to 24.7ks for pn ) .",
    "in addition to the time filtering , we used the standard event filtering described in procedures that are available on - line .",
    "we extracted source counts from a circular region with a radius of @xmath7 centered on igr  j14091 - 6108 and estimated the background using a rectangular region on parts of the detectors with no sources .",
    "after background subtraction , the 0.312kev count rates for pn , mos1 , and mos2 are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10c / s , respectively .",
    "we included 1% systematic errors on the pn and mos source spectra when fitting the energy spectra to account for calibration uncertainties .",
    "we examined the data from the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) , but the count rate for this instrument is too low to be useful .      for _ nustar _",
    "@xcite , we reduced the data using heasoft v6.17 , which includes nustardas v1.5.1 .",
    "the calibration files are from the 2015 march 16 version of the calibration database ( caldb ) .",
    "we ran nupipeline to produce event lists for the two _ nustar _ instruments : focal plane modules a and b ( fpma and fpmb ) .",
    "we examined the full band images , and extracted light curves and spectra with nuproducts using a circular source region with a radius of @xmath11 .",
    "although the _ nustar _ images do not show any significant stray light , spatial variations in the background are visible , which is expected .",
    "thus , we estimated the background using nuskybgd @xcite , which is a package of idl programs that sample the background over the field of view outside of the source region to model the spatial variations .",
    "we produced the model and then used it to estimate the background in the source region .",
    "we included 4% systematic errors on the background spectrum .",
    "after background subtraction , the 379kev source count rates are @xmath12 and @xmath13c / s for fpma and fpmb , respectively . finally , when producing the final spectra for fitting , we grouped the energy bins to give a significance of greater than 5-@xmath14 .",
    "we obtained low - resolution spectroscopy of the igr  j140916108 counterpart identified in @xcite , which is cxou  j140846.0610754 and vvv  j140845.99610754.1 .",
    "we used the fors2 instrument with the 300v and 300i grisms combined with the gc435 and og590 filters , respectively . in both cases , the slit - width was set to 1 , giving a @xmath15 average resolution .",
    "atmospheric conditions were medium - to - good , with a thin sky , seeing at 500  nm in the range 06 - 08 , and an airmass between 1.1 and 1.3 .",
    "the integration time of each individual frame was set to 600s and 500s for the 300v , and 300i grisms , respectively , and two exposures were taken in each grism . the a0v spectro - photometric standard star cd-32  9927 was observed in similar conditions for flux - calibration .",
    "we reduced the data using the dedicated pipeline ( v.  5.1.4 ) implemented in the eso data reduction environment reflex  v.  2.6 , following the standard steps for optical spectroscopy reduction to produce a cleaned , flatfielded , wavelength- and flux - calibrated 1d spectrum .",
    "we also obtained several optical spectra on ut 2015 january 15 using the goodman high - throughput spectrograph @xcite on the soar 4.1-m telescope .",
    "all data were taken with a @xmath16 slit .",
    "we obtained one 600 sec exposure using the 400 l mm@xmath17 grating ( wavelength coverage @xmath230007000  ; resolution 5.7  ) and two 600 sec exposures using the 1200 l mm@xmath17 grating ( wavelength coverage 54806740  ; resolution 1.7  ) .",
    "these data were wavelength calibrated with an fear arc lamp and were bias corrected using the overscan region .",
    "the spectra were optimally extracted using routines in iraf .",
    "we produced 0.312kev event lists for the three _ xmm _ instruments , including only the photons in a @xmath7 circular region centered on the position of igr  j140916108 .",
    "the times of the individual events were shifted to the solar system barycenter using the sas tool barycen .",
    "we used the @xmath18 ( rayleigh ) test @xcite to make periodograms from the event list .",
    "we searched for a periodic signal in the pn data by making a periodogram with 20000 time bins between 1 and 2000s .",
    "one significant peak is present with a peak value of @xmath19 ( see figure  [ fig : period]a ) .",
    "the false alarm probability ( fap ) is given by 0.5@xmath20 multiplied by the number of trials , corresponding to a fap of @xmath21 .",
    "the period is @xmath0s , where the 1-@xmath14 errors are given by the periods where the periodogram has fallen to @xmath221 .",
    "the mos1 and mos2 instruments showed significant peaks at @xmath23s and @xmath24s , respectively , which are both consistent with the period measured by pn ( figure  [ fig : period]a ) .",
    "we produced a folded light curve , which is shown in figure  [ fig : period]b .",
    "an epoch of zero phase ( minimum in the folded light curve ) is mjd tdb @xmath25 . to align the _",
    "xmm _ and _ nustar _ phases , we barycentered the _",
    "event lists and folded the _ nustar _",
    "photons on the _ xmm _ ephemeris .",
    "we calculated the pulsed fraction of the signal by defining maximum and minimum phase ranges using the 0.312kev folded light curve ( figure  [ fig : period]b ) . the pulsed fraction is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the maximum and minimum count rate divided by the sum of these quantities . in the 0.312kev range , it is @xmath1% .",
    "the folded light curves from 0.3 to 79kev are shown in figure  [ fig : folded_energy ] , and the values for the pulsed fraction are indicated on figure  [ fig : folded_energy ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : amp ] .",
    "the _ xmm _",
    "measurements show a strong decrease in the pulsed fraction with energy with the largest drop being at 7kev .",
    "the _ nustar _ measurements also show a drop with energy , with a pulsed fraction of @xmath26% in the 312kev band and @xmath27% ( no detection ) in the 1279kev band .",
    "a period of 576s is fairly typical for the spin period of a white dwarf in a cv of intermediate polar ( ip ) type . in the 2014 update of the @xcite cv catalog ,",
    "there are 78 ip - type cvs ( cv / ips ) with white dwarf spin periods between 128 and 12071s , and 20 systems have periods faster than 576s .",
    "the shortest cv / ip orbital period is 1552s , and the median orbital period is 4.1hr .",
    "thus , if igr  j140916108 is a cv / ip , the detected period is much more likely to be the white dwarf spin period , and the orbital period is probably between several and @xmath2100 times longer @xcite      figure  [ fig : optical1 ] displays the flux - calibrated soar / goodman ( magenta ) and vlt / fors2 ( blue ) spectra of igr  j14091@xmath286108 , on which all the detected spectroscopic features are marked .",
    "likewise , table  [ tab : speclines ] lists their main parameters , i.e. their central wavelengths ( @xmath29 ) , equivalent widths ( @xmath30 ) , full - widths at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , and intrinsic fluxes ( @xmath31 ) , obtained through single - gaussian fitting .",
    "the fwhms were quadratically corrected for the instrumental broadening and the underlying continua were locally assessed with a first - order polynomial . the continuum level being the primary source of inaccuracy , each measurement was repeated several times with different placements within the same wavelength range to obtain a set of values that eventually averaged out .",
    "the listed uncertainties are therefore the scatter to the mean rather than just statistical .",
    "the optical spectrum is very rich , with a wealth of spectral features that includes the balmer and paschen series as well as several signatures of and , all in emission . the bowen blend at 4640   , typical of irradiated accretion disks and/or companion stars in accreting systems ,",
    "is also clearly observed with fors2 and perhaps with goodman .",
    "the spectrum also appears to be strongly variable , the continuum and emission lines being roughly fives and three times brighter in the goodman spectrum , respectively .",
    "besides features intrinsic to igr  j14091@xmath286108 , we also report two diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) centered at 5780    and 6284   .",
    "dibs are strongly correlated to the ism extinction along the line - of - sight of the sources in which they are detected and we can assess the latter using the relationships between their equivalent widths and @xmath32 given in @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , dib6284 is likely contaminated with some atmospheric absorption troughs and we therefore rely on dib5780 only , for which @xcite obtain @xmath33 .",
    "we measure @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the goodman and fors2 spectra , respectively , which , once averaged out , leads to @xmath36 . using the relationship @xmath37 and an average total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath38",
    ", we thus derive @xmath39 , which is roughly consistent with a distance between 3 and 4 kpc based on the 3d galactic extinction map derived in @xcite for a line - of - sight 94 away from that of igr  j14091@xmath286108 .    with the knowledge of @xmath40 , it is now possible to correct igr  j14091@xmath286108 emission from the ism extinction and figure  [ fig : optical2 ] displays the extinction - corrected goodman and fors2 spectra expressed in hz vs mjy .",
    "the first result is that both continua are roughly best - fit with power laws with 2.29 and 2.09 spectral indices , respectively , typical of the raleigh - jeans tail of a black body emitter .",
    "we can also estimate the balmer decrements and we find h@xmath5/h@xmath41 = @xmath42 from the fors2 spectrum as well as h@xmath5/h@xmath41 = @xmath43 , h@xmath44/h@xmath41 = @xmath45 , h@xmath46/h@xmath41 = @xmath47 , h@xmath48/h@xmath41 = @xmath49 , and h@xmath50/h@xmath41 = @xmath51 from the goodman spectrum .",
    "it is clear that all the values are consistent with unity , which is typical of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and some microquasars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the wealth of emission lines , spectral variability , raleigh - jeans continuum , and flat balmer decrements around unity , it is thus very likely that the optical emission of igr  j14091@xmath286108 originates in an optically - thick irradiated accretion disk in a cv .      for spectral analysis",
    ", we jointly fitted the _",
    "( pn , mos1 , and mos2 ) and _ nustar _ ( fpma and fpmb ) data in the 0.379kev energy range .",
    "we used the xspec package @xcite and performed the fitting with @xmath52 minimization .",
    "we fitted with an absorbed power - law model , using @xcite abundances and @xcite cross sections for the absorption .",
    "we also allowed for normalization differences between instruments by introducing a multiplicative constant .",
    "thus , the overall model in xspec notation was constant*tbabs*pegpwrlw .",
    "this showed that the spectrum is hard with @xmath53 , but the fit was poor with @xmath54 for 346 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the largest residuals appear in the iron line region , indicating a strong emission line . adding a gaussian with @xmath55kev and @xmath56kev provides a large improvement in the fit ( to @xmath57 ) , but negative residuals in the high energy part of the spectrum indicate curvature in the spectrum and possibly a cutoff .",
    "we changed the continuum model from a power - law to a thermal bremsstrahlung component to allow for curvature in the model and also because this is the emission mechanism that is thought to operate in cv / ips . while the model constant*tbabs*(gaussian+bremss )",
    "does not provide a good fit to the data ( @xmath58 ) , partial covering absorption is typically used when fitting cv / ips @xcite , and , in our case , using pcfabs with @xmath59@xmath60 and a covering fraction of @xmath61 improves the fit greatly to @xmath62 . with this model",
    ", the bremsstrahlung temperature is very high , @xmath63kev ( 90% confidence limit ) , but there are still residuals at the high energy end that we suspect are related to the presence of a reflection component .",
    "reflection of the hard x - ray emission off the white dwarf surface is often included in models when fitting cv / ip spectra , and recent work with _",
    "xmm _ and _ nustar _ spectra show strong evidence for this component in three other cv / ips @xcite . for igr",
    "j140916108 , we added a reflection component using the reflect model in xspec .",
    "this model is based on @xcite , which is for reflection of direct emission from neutral material and includes the dependence on viewing angle . by convolving bremss with reflect ,",
    "the model includes both a direct and a reflected bremsstrahlung component where the strength of the reflected component depends on the amplitude parameter , @xmath64 . in our case , if the reflection amplitude is left as a free parameter , it will increase to values above 1.0 .",
    "however , assuming that we see 100% of the direct emission , values of @xmath64 above unity are not physically possible for reflection from the white dwarf surface .",
    "thus , we fix the reflection amplitude to 1.0 , resulting in a fit with @xmath65 .",
    "the spectrum fit with this model is shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum_counts ] , and the parameters are given in table  [ tab : spec1 ] .",
    "although the bremsstrahlung temperature drops when the reflection component is added , we still measure @xmath66kev , which , as we discuss in section 4 , is high for a cv / ip . for this fit ,",
    "the 0.379kev unabsorbed ( i.e. , with the interstellar but not the partial covering column density set to zero ) flux is @xmath67erg@xmath60s@xmath17 .",
    "while the actual reflection component has three main features : the compton hump above 10kev , the iron edge at 7.1kev ( for neutral iron ) , and an iron fluorescence line at 6.4kev ( also for neutral iron ) , the @xcite model only includes the first two features , which is one reason that we include the gaussian in the model above .",
    "if the emission line was due only to reflection from the white dwarf surface , we would expect a relatively narrow line centered at 6.4kev ; however , as shown in table  [ tab : spec1 ] , we measure a broad line with @xmath68kev at an energy above 6.4kev ( @xmath69kev ) .",
    "it is very likely that this is due to contributions from higher ionization states coming from the hot material in the accretion column , and this is common for cv / ips @xcite .",
    "we modified the model to include two lines with energies fixed to 6.4kev ( neutral iron ) and 6.7kev ( he - like iron ) .",
    "this more physical representation of the emission lines provides an equivalently good fit ( @xmath70 ) , but the lines are still relatively broad ( @xmath71kev ) . adding a third line at 6.97kev ( h - like iron ) improves the fit ( @xmath72 ) , and these lines are significantly narrower ( @xmath73kev ) , which is consistent with line widths measured for other cv / ips @xcite .",
    "the line normalizations in table  [ tab : spec1 ] include 90% confidence uncertainties , suggesting that all the lines are significantly detected .",
    "thus , the three - line model is very likely the correct interpretation based on the match between measured and expected line widths as well as on statistical grounds . in this model ,",
    "the equivalent widths of the three lines are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76ev for neutral , he - like , and h - like iron , respectively .",
    "to explore the possible physical cause of the high temperature derived from the fitting the continuum with a bremsstrahlung model , we replaced the bremsstrahlung component with the ip mass ( ipm ) model of @xcite .",
    "for the ipm model , the hardness and cutoff energy of the predicted spectrum are both set by the white dwarf mass , and the only two free parameters are @xmath77 and the normalization .",
    "physically , this connection between the @xmath77 and the spectrum is related to the maximum shock temperature in the accretion column ( suleimanov et al .",
    "2005 ; hailey et al . ,",
    "submitted to apj ) .",
    "the emission mechanism is still bremsstrahlung , but the model includes a range of temperatures .",
    "the results for a model including direct and reflected ipm components , partial covering , and three gaussians are reported in table  [ tab : spec2 ] .",
    "as before , we fix the reflection amplitude to 1.0 , and the other reflection parameters are consistent to the values found in the bremsstrahlung fits . also , there is little or no change in the continuum absorption and the emission line parameters .",
    "the ipm model parameters imply a high white dwarf mass , @xmath78 .",
    "the components of the spectrum are shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum_efe ] .",
    "we note that none of the models we have used provide formally acceptable fits , with the best one having a reduced-@xmath52 of 1.36 for 338 dof . @xcite",
    "obtained similar fit qualities for his _ xmm_+_nustar _",
    "spectra of cv / ips and suggested that it is related to calibration differences between instruments , and this is also a possibility in our case .",
    "however , we explored some possibilities for improving the fits .",
    "for example , the fit improves if we start with the model given in table  [ tab : spec2 ] and allow @xmath64 to increase above 1.0 .",
    "although likely unphysical , the fit improves from a reduced-@xmath52 of 1.42 ( for 338 dof ) to 1.33 ( for 337 dof ) at @xmath79 . also , allowing the reflection component to dominate at high energies causes the ipm component to soften , and , for the extreme assumption that @xmath79 , @xmath77 drops to 1.2 .",
    "the fit can also be improved by modifying the modeling of the absorption . in some cv / ips",
    ", there is evidence for complex absorption patterns , and other authors have modeled this with two partial coverers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "adding a second partial coverer to the 3 gaussian bremsstrahlung model in table  [ tab : spec1 ] improves the reduced-@xmath52 from 1.36 ( for 338 dof ) to 1.23 ( for 336 dof ) .",
    "although this is a significant improvement , this model leads to an interstellar column density of @xmath80@xmath60 , which is much lower than the value implied by our measured optical extinction . using the relation from @xcite , an @xmath40 of @xmath81 magnitudes corresponds to @xmath82@xmath60 .",
    "thus , while both high reflection amplitude and additional partial covering absorption lead to improved fits , the former is not consistent with the physical scenario and the latter leads to unrealistically low values for the interstellar column density .    to avoid the complexities of the low energy part of the spectrum",
    ", we also explored fitting just the _ nustar _ spectrum above 10kev .",
    "fitting with a bremsstrahlung model gives a reduced-@xmath52 of 1.62 for 37 dof , and the 90% confidence lower limit on the temperature is 112kev . adding a reflection component with @xmath83 , which makes the model constant*reflect*bremss , provides a good fit ( reduced-@xmath52 = 1.14 for 35 dof ) , and the bremsstrahlung temperature is @xmath84kev . with constant*reflect*ipm and @xmath83",
    ", we find @xmath85 , which is consistent with the high mass values we obtain when fitting the entire spectrum .",
    "the results indicate that we can identify igr  j140916108 as a cv / ip with a high degree of confidence .",
    "the @xmath0s periodicity shows that there is a magnetized compact object in the system , and the hardness of the x - ray spectrum is typical of only a cv / ip or an accreting pulsar in an hmxb .",
    "the optical spectrum is dominated by an optically - thick irradiated accretion disk , and no evidence for emission from the companion star is found , indicating that it must be a low - mass star and ruling out the hmxb possibility .",
    "there is also strong long - term optical variability in the continuum and emission lines , the origin of which is not clear .",
    "ips are known to be strongly variable in the optical regime and often show large spectroscopic modulations associated with the spin period of the white dwarf and/or the orbital period ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while this may be the case for igr  j14091@xmath286108 , especially for the spectral lines , we believe that the large brightness difference between the fors2 and goodman optical spectra is mainly due to different accretion rates within the accretion disk .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is also consistent with a cv / ip , and we confirm the presence of the strong iron line originally reported by @xcite using _ chandra _ measurements . with _ xmm _ , we find that the line emission is consistent with being a combination of lines from three ionization states with widths of @xmath86kev and equivalent widths in the 160320ev range .",
    "these values are typical of iron line complexes seen in cv / ips @xcite .",
    "also , combining the 0.379kev flux of @xmath67erg@xmath60s@xmath17 with our estimated distance of 34kpc from the optical extinction , we obtain an x - ray luminosity of @xmath87@xmath88ergs@xmath17 , which is consistent with expectations for cv / ips . in the @xcite catalog ,",

    ". however , we note that igr  j140916108 itself is not in the @xcite catalog , suggesting the possible presence of a much larger number of cv / ips close to the _ integral _ detection limit .",
    "the strong drop in the pulsed fraction with energy that we see for igr  j140916108 has been seen for other cv / ips .",
    "@xcite report this energy dependence for the cv / ips ao  psc and v1223  sgr . for v1223",
    "sgr , phase - resolved spectroscopy shows that the energy dependence is primarily related to changes in the column density of absorbing material local to the cv @xcite , and we suspect that this is also the case for igr  j140916108 .",
    "while igr  j140916108 is typical of cv / ips in many respects , it is a candidate system for having a higher than typical white dwarf mass . using the ip mass model that @xcite applied to 14 cv / ips",
    ", we obtain a mass in excess of 1.3  for igr  j140916108 , while @xcite find masses between @xmath89  ( for ex hya ) and @xmath90  ( for v1062 tau ) .",

    "<S> the optical spectra show strong emission lines with significant variability in the lines and continuum , indicating that they come from an irradiated accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> based on these measurements , we identify the source as a magnetic cataclysmic variable of intermediate polar ( ip ) type where the white dwarf spin period is 576.3s . the x - ray spectrum is consistent with the continuum emission mechanism being due to thermal bremsstrahlung , but partial covering absorption and reflection are also required . </S>",
