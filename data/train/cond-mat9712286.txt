    "most recent experiments @xcite on dilute , magnetically - trapped , alkali - atom bose gases have viewed phenomena which are well described by the zero  temperature ( @xmath3 ) mean  field theory of the bose ",
    "einstein condensate ( bec ) , in which virtually all the gas in the system resides in the condensed state .",
    "the technique of evaporative cooling @xcite , used in all such experiments , grows the bec by selective extraction of the non - condensed , `` thermal , '' component of the gas , which is located at the outer edges of the trap.@xcite the @xmath3 mean  field theory has been found to give a good account of many bec properties observed in these systems .",
    "@xcite new experiments  @xcite have started to probe becs at @xmath0 , and so the testing of alternative finite  temperature bec theories has begun .",
    "this paper draws attention to common features emerging from several independent finite - temperature theories , which suggest that a relatively simple picture , which we call the `` two - gas model , '' describes many of the properties of a dilute bose gas with repulsive atomic pair interactions ( scattering length @xmath4 ) .",
    "the two gases concerned are the condensate gas , the intrinsic properties of which are essentially _ independent _ of temperature ; and the thermal , non - condensed gas , which behaves much like an ideal bose gas at temperature @xmath5 in an effective potential created by the condensate .",
    "this model emerges naturally as a limiting case of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov - popov ( hfb - popov)@xcite and hartree - fock ( hf)@xcite approximations , but its features seem also to be manifest in recent quantum monte carlo @xcite and semiclassical @xcite calculations .",
    "the two  gas picture offers some straightforward implications for interpretation of experiments and for further development of first  principles theories .",
    "our evidence for the validity of this picture first emerged from large  scale numerical calculations , but its origin can be traced back qualitatively within the structure of finite  temperature field theory . in sec .",
    "2 , we show how such a theory can plausibly lead to a two  gas scenario .",
    "section 3 explores some of the implications of the model .",
    "the hfb - popov equations have been derived elsewhere@xcite and we merely state the basic equations here . in the heisenberg equation of motion , the bose field operator , @xmath6 is decomposed into a @xmath7-number wavefunction @xmath8 that describes a condensate of @xmath9 atoms , and an operator @xmath10 describing the non - condensate atoms : @xmath11 . in the hfb - popov approximation , the wave function for a condensate of trapped atoms satisfies a generalized gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation :    @xmath12 \\right\\ } \\psi_0({\\bf r } )   = \\mu \\psi_0({\\bf r } ) , \\label{gen_gp_eq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian for a single atom of mass @xmath14 and position coordinate @xmath15 ; the trapping potential ( for cylindrically symmetric systems of current interest ) is given by @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the radial and axial angular frequencies of the trap ; @xmath19 expresses the binary interaction between atoms ; the chemical potential @xmath20 , interpreted as the work required to add one more atom to the _ condensate _ , is treated as an eigenvalue ; and @xmath8 is normalized to unity .",
    "the function @xmath21 is the density of the non - condensed component of the gas , @xmath22n_{j } + \\left|v_{j}({\\bf r})\\right|^{2}\\right\\ } , \\label{nc_density}\\ ] ] where @xmath23^{-1 } \\label{befactor}\\ ] ] is the bose - einstein factor , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant . the quasi - particle excitation energies @xmath26 and amplitudes @xmath27",
    "are obtained by solution of the coupled hfb - popov equations : @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the total trapped - atom density .    in simple physical terms ,",
    "( [ gen_gp_eq]-[hfb_v ] ) describe a condensate subject to interaction with itself and a thermal cloud , with the cloud being generated by thermal excitations of condensate quasi ",
    "particles ( there is also a non - thermal contribution to this cloud , the so - called `` quantum depletion '' term represented by the rightmost term of eq . ( [ nc_density ] ) , but it is much smaller than the thermal component except near @xmath1 ) . to solve these equations for a given atomic species and trap configuration , we fix the values of @xmath5 and @xmath2 , and then determine all other quantities self  consistently , eventually obtaining the total number of trapped atoms , @xmath32 , via    @xmath33    by carrying out a sequence of such ( laborious ) calculations",
    ", we can map out the @xmath34 phase diagram of the interacting bose gas .",
    "we present elsewhere @xcite a detailed comparison of the results of this approach with experimental data for the @xmath35rb condensate at jila @xcite ; for the temperature  dependent quasiparticle excitation energies , hfb - popov agrees with experiment to within 5% for temperatures from zero up to 65% of the temperature @xmath36 of the phase transition for the corresponding ideal gas ( corresponding to thermal fractions from less than 1% to about 50% ) .",
    "although at present there are considerable discrepancies as @xmath37 , it seems that hfb - popov is a useful working theory over a significant temperature range .",
    "several calculations @xcite have shown that , for current experiments , the quantum depletion of a small condensate is negligible , _",
    "i.  e. _ , @xmath38 .",
    "this justifies use of the approximation @xmath39 which is equivalent to the hartree - fock approximation used by other authors  @xcite . if we apply this approximation to eq .",
    "( [ hfb_u ] ) ( and neglect the contribution of @xmath21 to @xmath40 ) , we obtain an ordinary schrdinger equation for @xmath41 , @xmath42 u_j({\\bf r } ) = e_j u_j({\\bf r } ) , \\label{ulse}\\ ] ] where the effective potential , given by @xmath43 is that of the trap modified by the repulsive pair interaction between the thermally  excited atoms and the condensate density .",
    "if we consider the case of a relatively small thermal fraction , then we expect to find the condensate localized near the center of the trap , so that eq .",
    "( [ cloudcond ] ) presents the thermal cloud with a trap and repulsive core .",
    "thus , at least the low  energy quasi ",
    "particle amplitudes @xmath44 will be expelled from the core , _",
    "i.  e. _ , they will have little overlap with the condensate wavefunction .",
    "this then gives consistency of eq .",
    "( [ hfb_v ] ) with our initial approximation , eq .",
    "( [ v_is_0 ] ) .",
    "it also justifies the approximation that completes our portrayal of a two  gas system : because of the expulsion of quasi ",
    "particle amplitudes from the condensate , we assume that @xmath21 can be neglected in eq.([gen_gp_eq ] ) , so that the condensate wavefunction is determined by solving @xmath45   \\psi_0({\\bf r } ) = \\mu \\psi_0({\\bf r } ) , \\label{gp}\\ ] ] which is just the usual gp equation for a condensate of @xmath2 atoms at @xmath1 .",
    "thus , these arguments have led us to a simple picture in which the finite  temperature bose system appears to be composed of two distinct gases .",
    "one of these gases , the bec , is always effectively at zero temperature , and is described by an equation which depends only on its own atomic population , @xmath2 , and the trap parameters .",
    "the other gas , the thermal cloud , behaves as a normal bose gas at finite temperature , sensing the presence of the condensate through an elastic interaction ; it does not undergo bose - einstein condensation itself , but serves as an atomic reservoir for the bec .",
    "this resembles the phenomenon of bec of an ideal gas in an external potential , except that we account for interactions in the identification of the ground state , and in the modification by the condensate of the external potential exposed to the thermal cloud .",
    "the two - gas model provides us with a straightforward way of computing the phase diagram of the dilute bose gas for @xmath46 .",
    "if there are @xmath2 atoms in the bec , we solve eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) to obtain what we will call an equivalent zero  temperature condensate ( ezc ) , _",
    "i.  e. _ the corresponding @xmath1 condensate that contains @xmath2 atoms .",
    "the ezc solution provides us an orbital @xmath47 and chemical potential @xmath48 ; with these in hand , we can construct @xmath49 and find the spectrum of eq.([ulse ] ) .",
    "this procedure , which is independent of @xmath5 , gives us the information we need to compute the equilibrium value of @xmath32 for given values of @xmath2 and @xmath5 : we evaluate eq .",
    "( [ sumoverstates ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ befactor ] ) .",
    "in short , the ezc provides a `` reference condensate '' which , for a given set of trap parameters , describes all systems with the _ same number of condensate atoms _ @xmath2 . as we have shown elsewhere ,  @xcite this model provides good agreement with the results of full hfb - popov calculations of condensate and thermal densities and the critical temperature @xmath36 ; the emergence of an ezc can also be seen in the analysis by krauth @xcite of the results of his quantum monte carlo calculations , and in the recent quasi  classical calculations of minguzzi _ et al .",
    "comparison of the ezc condensate densities with those of hfb - popov calculations is made in fig .",
    "( [ hfbezc ] ) ; this shows that even in cases where the condensate fraction @xmath50 is as small as 0.1 , the condensate is relatively unperturbed by the presence of the thermal cloud .",
    "another straightforward implication of the two  gas model concerns the density profile of the thermal cloud .",
    "if we entertain the simple hypothesis that the cloud would be described by classical statistical mechanics of an ideal gas , then its density @xmath21 would be proportional to @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath49 is repulsive at small @xmath52 and confining at large @xmath52 , @xmath21 will attain its maximum away from the center of the condensate .",
    "if we consider the thomas  fermi limit  @xcite appropriate to large condensates , then for the case of a spherical condensate [ @xmath53 we find that @xmath54 where the thomas  fermi radius , @xmath55^{1/5}$ ] , defines the sharp boundary of the condensate .",
    "thus in this limit , @xmath21 is largest at the surface of the condensate , and its distribution becomes more localized as @xmath2 increases , albeit slowly .",
    "the key qualitative aspects of this classical description are applicable to the quantum system , as shown in fig.([thermal ] ) : this displays results of a full quantum - mechanical finite - number description , without any of the semiclassical continuous spectrum approximations made by other authors @xcite .",
    "this figure clearly suggests that quantitative interpretations of experimental data on finite  temperature condensates , _",
    "e.g. _ determination of a condensate fraction from density measurements , will have to invoke some detailed model of the thermal distribution , since this distribution is neither monotonic nor close to the results obtained for a noninteracting gas . on the other hand",
    ", our current model suggests that the condensate and thermal densities are relatively distinctly segregated within the cloud , which may considerably simplify the qualitative understanding of some properties .",
    "since it originates in the distinction between interactions of condensate and non  condensate atoms , this spatial segregation of the two gases seems to be a fundamental aspect of the behavior of _ inhomogeneous _ bose gases , such as the trapped  atom systems of current interest .",
    "this may have interesting consequences for applications : for example , it may be possible to selectively extract condensate _ vs. _ thermal atoms from a trap by appropriate positioning of a probe , thus obtaining an outcoupled matter wave with higher coherence than would be otherwise expected .",
    "@xcite in homogeneous systems , on the other hand , condensate and non  condensate populations are intertwined ; this is one of the essential features of the two  fluid model of liquid helium.@xcite    taking this idea further , we suggest that any property of a finite  temperature bec should be compared in the first instance to that of the corresponding ezc . in the two  gas model , we expect most of the @xmath5-dependence of a given quantity to be reduced to @xmath2-dependence . for example , in fig .",
    "( [ frequencies ] ) we show the quasiparticle excitation frequencies for the jila top trap , over a range of temperatures relevant to recent experiments , as computed in the full hfb - popov approximation and in the two  gas model .",
    "it is seen that the two methods agree up to temperatures quite close to the phase transition , so the main effect of finite temperature is renormalization of the value of @xmath2 .",
    "an analogous result was seen in earlier calculations@xcite for the _ homogeneous _ bose  condensed gas of the temperature dependence of the speed of sound , which found it to be given by an equivalent @xmath1 expression adjusted for the temperature  dependence of the condensate density .",
    "we find that condensate and thermal populations of a partially bose  einstein  condensed trapped ",
    "atom system separate out to a considerable extent . treating the condensate as uncoupled from the thermal cloud , and the thermal cloud as interacting with a static condensate potential , yields results similar to those that come from involved self  consistent field calculations .",
    "these results motivate the identification of the equivalent zero  temperature condensate ( ezc ) as a consolidating feature of finite  temperature systems . in this model ,",
    "the main effect of finite temperature on the condensate is _ depletion _ of the condensate number .",
    "condensate properties that depend only weakly upon @xmath2 , such as the quasi  particle spectrum in the large@xmath2 limit ( corresponding to the excitation frequencies of large condensates )",
    ",  @xcite should exhibit only weak temperature dependence .",
