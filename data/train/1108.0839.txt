    "the recent experimental realization of artificial magnetic and electric fields acting on neutral atoms @xcite opened the way to simulate ultracold many  body systems in controllable ( static ) electro  magnetic fields @xcite : these synthetic fields can be implemented using spatially dependent optical couplings between internal states of the atoms .",

    "such a possibility , eventually together with the use of rotating traps @xcite and/or the application of more general multipod schemes @xcite , envisions the concrete opportunity of manipulating and studying interacting ultracold systems in a vast class of simulated magnetic and electric fields .    an important perspective motivated by the realization of synthetic magnetic fields is given by the simulation of quantum hall physics with ultracold atoms . as it is well known , the effect of a rotation on a neutral ultracold gas is equivalent to that of a magnetic field on a system of charged particles @xcite : since the first experiments with bose gases in rotating traps @xcite , this fact called for the possibility to realize laughlin states and other quantum hall states using two  dimensional strongly interacting ultracold gases in rapidly rotating traps ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "however the achievement of laughlin states and quantum hall regimes with rotating gases turned out to be in general not an easy task , since for typical experimental numbers the rotation frequency @xmath2 should be very close to the trap frequency @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "however , even if the landau level structure is not broken , in general the excitations of the system remain abelian @xcite . in @xcite , using exact diagonalization , the fractional quantum hall effect for two  dimensional interacting bosons in the presence of a non  abelian gauge field ( in addition to the usual abelian magnetic field ) was studied , obtaining that for small non  abelian fields one has a single internal state quantum hall system , whereas for stronger fields there is a two internal state behaviour ( or the complete absence of hall plateaus ) .    in @xcite",
    "the landau levels and the quantum hall states were studied for a two  component two  dimensional gas subjected to the non  abelian gauge potential @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( where the @xmath11 s are the pauli matrices ) .",
    "the reasons for choosing such potential were the following : _",

    "for both bosons ( in the presence of a strong intra  species interaction ) and fermions , explicit expressions for the ground  states were obtained , showing that deformed laughlin states - with abelian excitations - appear ; however , ground  states with non  abelian excitations emerge at the points ( e.g. , @xmath16 ) in which different landau levels have the same energy .    the goal of this paper is two  fold . from one side",
    "we investigate the effect of general homogeneous non  abelian terms added to the usual abelian magnetic field ( assumed equal for both the components , so that the landau levels are degenerate in the abelian limit ) , in order to discuss and classify under which conditions the structure of degenerate landau levels is preserved . from the the other side we present a detailed discussion of the corresponding many",
    "particle quantum hall states derived in @xcite , providing additional results and a discussion of the effect of an angular momentum term .",
    "we also consider @xmath1 non  abelian potentials giving rise to lines ( in place of points ) of degeneracy .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section [ intro ] we study the single  particle hamiltonian and the landau levels of a two  component two  dimensional bose gas in an artificial @xmath0 gauge potential , having doubly degenerate landau levels in the abelian limit and a non - abelian @xmath17 gauge potential independent on the position .",
    "we argue that there are only three classes of ( quadratic ) hamiltonians preserving the degeneracy of the landau levels and giving rise to an analytically defined landau level structure , where the eigenstates are expressed as a finite linear combination of the eigenstates of a particle in a magnetic field .",
    "the first class corresponds to an abelian @xmath18 gauge potential and it refers to uncoupled internal states , whereas the other two are characterized by a truly non ",
    "abelian @xmath0 gauge potential and correspond to different kinds of jaynes  cummings models",
    ". then we focus on one of these jaynes ",
    "cummings classes which is gauge equivalent both to a rashba and to a dresselhaus spin  orbit coupling : after discussing in section [ sectripod ] how this non  abelian gauge potential can be implemented in a rotating tripod scheme , we analyze the landau level spectrum in section [ oneparticle ] , where we also present results for @xmath1 gauge potentials acting on a three  component gas . in section [ twobody ]",
    "we write the deformed laughlin states in the presence of two  body interactions , while in section [ angular ] we discuss the effect of an angular momentum term .",
    "section [ degeneracy ] is devoted to the study of the ground  states and excitations at the degeneracy points , while our conclusions are in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we first introduce the single  particle hamiltonian of a single  component gas in a constant magnetic field in order to set the notation for the following results .",
    "we then consider a two  component gas characterized by two internal degrees of freedom : these two components provide a pseudospin degree of freedom ( hereafter denoted simply as spin ) .",
    "we analyze the general properties of its spectrum when a non - abelian @xmath17 gauge potential independent on the position , thus characterized by a constant wilson loop @xcite , is added to a constant magnetic field ( equal for both the spins ) .",
    "we show that there are only three classes of quadratic hamiltonians , describing a single particle in such effective @xmath0 gauge potential , giving rise to an analytically defined landau level structure ( with eigenstates expressed as a finite linear combination of the eigenstates of a particle in a magnetic field ) .",
    "the first class corresponds to an abelian @xmath19 gauge potential and it refers to uncoupled spin states , whereas the other two are characterized by a truly non - abelian @xmath0 gauge potential and correspond to different kinds of jaynes - cummings models .",
    "we first remind the standard case of a spinless atom moving on a plane and subjected to a ( fictitious ) constant magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this case corresponds to a @xmath20 gauge potential : the hamiltonian reads @xmath21 ( with units such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "the vector potential @xmath24 in the symmetric gauge is @xmath25 introducing the complex coordinate @xmath26 , we define the operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 these operators obey the commutation rules @xmath29=1\\,,\\qquad \\left[l^\\dag , l \\right]=1\\,,\\qquad   \\left [ l , d \\right]=\\left [ l , d^\\dag \\right]=0.\\ ] ] @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be considered as ladder operators and allow us to express the hamiltonian ( [ ham_single ] ) as @xmath32 .",
    "the operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 enter the definition of the angular momentum of the particle through the relation @xmath35 such that @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively decrease and increase @xmath36 .",
    "each energy eigenstate is degenerate with respect to the angular momentum , therefore it is possible to characterize the usual landau levels by the index @xmath37 .    in order to maintain the angular momentum degeneracy of the eigenstates , a generic hamiltonian @xmath38 for a spinless atom have to be independent of the operators",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "imposing this hamiltonian to be at most quadratic in the momentum we obtain that @xmath38 can be written as a function of the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an overall energy scale , @xmath41 is a real parameter , whereas @xmath42 and @xmath43 are complex coefficients .",
    "it is easy to show that the hamiltonian ( [ spinless ] ) can be recast in the following form @xmath44 where the operators @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 in order to satisfy the commutation relation @xmath47=1 $ ] , with the complex parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 related to the coefficients in ( [ spinless ] ) .",
    "the operators @xmath50 allow to express the hamiltonian in the simple quadratic form ( [ spinless2 ] ) , which makes evident the landau level structure of the single  particle problem .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the mapping from @xmath51 to @xmath50 corresponds to an affine transformation of the space coordinates of the kind : @xmath52      we consider now a system of ( non - interacting ) atoms characterized by a pseudospin degree of freedom that can assume the eigenstates @xmath53 and @xmath54 on the @xmath55 direction .",
    "therefore , in the above description of the single  particle system , it is necessary to introduce also the pauli matrices @xmath56 to complete the observable algebra generated by @xmath57 and @xmath34 .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 couple the two spin components , whereas @xmath60 and the @xmath8 identity matrix @xmath61 describe particles whose states @xmath53 and @xmath54 are decoupled . more generally , to describe a system characterized by a @xmath19 symmetry corresponding to two decoupled states in the same magnetic field b , the hamiltonian must be a function of the operators @xmath62 and a single linear combination of pauli matrices , @xmath63 , that we can relabel as @xmath60 without loss of generality .",
    "this generic problem is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath64 such hamiltonian describes a particle in the uniform magnetic field @xmath13 and it is the most general one which is quadratic in the momentum , fulfils the u(1)@xmath65u(1 ) gauge symmetry and is independent on the angular momentum .",
    "it constitutes a simple generalization of the hamiltonian ( [ spinless ] ) to two non  interacting spin components , thus it can be solved by implementing two different coordinate transformations of the kind ( [ affine ] ) for the two inner states . using the unitary transformation @xmath66 ,",
    "the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 become @xmath67 this unitary transformation , combined with the real space affine transformations ( [ affine ] ) , allows us to define the operator @xmath68 with the parameters chosen in order to satisfy the commutation relation @xmath69=1 $ ] .",
    "apart from constant terms , the hamiltonian ( [ u1xu1 g ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath70 with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 real parameters .",
    "both the spin @xmath60 and the angular momentum @xmath36 are proper quantum numbers and @xmath73 constitutes a zeeman term .",
    "thus , the spectrum of the hamiltonian is characterized by the presence of landau levels , degenerate with respect to @xmath36 and labelled by both @xmath60 and @xmath74 : if @xmath72 and @xmath73 go to zero , all the landau levels result degenerate also with respect to the spin .",
    "we conclude this section by observing that every single  particle hamiltonian of the kind ( [ u1xu1 g ] ) can be recast in the form ( [ u1xu1 ] ) with suitable transformations . equation ( [ u1xu1 ] ) makes evident the existence of a quantum number @xmath74 which defines the landau level structure .",
    "the main characteristic of the hamiltonian @xmath75 is the fact that it does not depend on @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and therefore it corresponds to a gauge symmetry @xmath19 : we will refer to this case as the _ abelian limit _ of the more general @xmath0 we are going to introduce in the following .",
    "in this section we consider particles subjected both to an artificial magnetic field and to a general artificial @xmath17 homogeneous non  abelian gauge potential ( simulating a general spin  orbit coupling ) .",
    "our goal is to characterize the conditions under which the non - abelian gauge potential preserves the landau levels .",
    "more precisely , we want to classify the single  particle hamiltonians with a general homogeneous non  abelian term added to a magnetic field ( equal for both spins ) such that the following properties are satisfied :    1 .",
    "their energy spectrum presents a landau level structure .",
    "[ cond1 ] 2",
    ".   every landau level is degenerate with respect to the angular momentum @xmath36 .",
    "[ cond2 ] 3 .   in the abelian limit ,",
    "the landau levels become degenerate with respect of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "[ cond3 ]    the condition [ cond1 ] about the existence of the landau levels is very general : it is indeed known that for a broad class of spin  orbit interactions the spectrum of the single  particle hamiltonian is composed by eigenstates expressed as infinite series @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "in the following , we restrict our attention to landau levels such that the corresponding wavefunctions can be expressed as a finite sum of terms .",
    "we observe that the condition [ cond3 ] is not strictly necessary to obtain a proper landau level structure , however it is necessary to implement the @xmath0 gauge symmetry which will characterize the hamiltonian we will investigate in the following . in general , terms as the ones in @xmath72 and @xmath73 in ( [ u1xu1 ] ) break this symmetry and do not satisfy the condition [ cond3 ]",
    ". nevertheless they do not spoil the main characteristics of the system we will study in section [ oneparticle ] and can be easily taken into account in the following analysis .    to obtain the most general hamiltonians satisfying the conditions [ cond1 ] - [ cond3 ]",
    ", we use the single  particle algebra defined in sections [ secu1 ] - [ secu1xu1 ] .",
    "condition [ cond2 ] implies that the spectrum of the hamiltonian must be degenerate with respect to the angular momentum @xmath36 .",
    "therefore one obtains @xmath76=\\left[h , l^\\dag\\right]=0 $ ] and the hamiltonian does not depend on @xmath33 and @xmath34 , but only on @xmath77 .",
    "as in the previous case ( [ u1xu1 g ] ) , spin  orbit couplings can give rise , in general , to terms in the hamiltonian that are not proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "therefore it is necessary to introduce a wider class of ladder operators @xmath45 and @xmath79 generalizing the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 previously introduced ( see @xcite for an accurate description based on the landau gauge ) .",
    "condition [ cond1 ] can be rephrased in terms of these generalized ladder operators imposing that there must exist an integral of motion @xmath80 characterized by @xmath81=0 \\ , ,   \\qquad \\left [ n,\\gamma^\\dag\\right]=\\gamma^\\dag \\ , , \\qquad \\left [ n,\\gamma\\right]=-\\gamma \\label{eqndd},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 obey the commutation relations @xmath82=1 $ ] and @xmath83=\\left[\\gamma , l^\\dag \\right]=0 $ ] , and there exists an eigenstate @xmath84 of @xmath45 with eigenvalue @xmath85 : @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath45 can be defined as a linear combination of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and , eventually , some constant terms .",
    "the role of the integral of motion @xmath80 is to label the generalized landau levels obtained from the couplings between the pseudospin states . to satisfy ( [ eqndd ] ) ,",
    "@xmath80 must be chosen in the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a real vector we want to determine .",
    "we define now the most general single  particle hamiltonian satisfying the previous conditions , with the constraint that it can be at most quadratic in the momentum @xmath89 ( and , therefore , in the operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "we can divide the hamiltonian into two terms : the first one , @xmath75 , corresponds to the abelian gauge symmetry @xmath19 and represents the case of uncoupled spin components : @xmath90 the second term , @xmath91 , is instead the non  abelian contribution @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a real vector , @xmath94 is a real vector with spatial part @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , @xmath97 are complex vectors with spatial parts @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the total hamiltonian ( apart from constant terms ) is given by @xmath100 .",
    "we observe that , if the following conditions are satisfied :    * @xmath101 , with @xmath102 a real vector and @xmath103 a real constant ; * @xmath104 , with @xmath105 a real vector and @xmath106 a real constant ; * all the vectors @xmath107 and @xmath102 are parallel to each other along the direction @xmath108 ;    then the hamiltonian can be reduced to the @xmath18 case ( [ u1xu1 g ] ) previously studied through proper transformations . in this case",
    "we have shown that there is a landau level operator @xmath74 commuting with the hamiltonian .",
    "the previous conditions imply that the system is not characterized by a proper @xmath0 gauge potential since only one effective component of the spin , @xmath63 , enters the hamiltonian .    in the generic @xmath0 case with arbitrary vectors",
    "@xmath109 , it is impossible to gauge away all the terms in @xmath110 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to search for an integral of motion @xmath80 defined in terms of the @xmath30 operators as @xmath111 ; in order to satisfy the relation @xmath112=0 $ ] , we obtain from the commutation rules the conditions @xmath113 equation ( [ eqzc ] ) requires the vectors @xmath114 and @xmath115 to be parallel ; without loss of generality , we can impose them to be in the @xmath55 direction with an appropriate spin rotation and @xmath115 assumes the form @xmath116 .",
    "the equations ( [ eqac ] ) and ( [ eqbc ] ) are not compatible in general , unless either @xmath117 or @xmath99 is zero .",
    "imposing in ( [ eqac ] ) @xmath118 and @xmath119 , by using the transformation ( [ aff1 ] ) , equation ( [ eqac ] ) can be recast in the form @xmath120 the previous equations state that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath117 have to be orthogonal to each other and orthogonal to @xmath88",
    ". therefore the condition ( [ eqndd ] ) implies , in the case @xmath121 , that @xmath117 must lie in the @xmath14 plane and , moreover , that @xmath122 in order to satisfy ( [ i m a ] ) and ( [ rea ] ) .",
    "therefore we can choose a proper spin basis in which @xmath123 similarly one can consider the case in which @xmath124 : to satisfy equation ( [ eqbc ] ) , @xmath125 must lie in the system plane and @xmath126 with @xmath127 ( which is incompatible with the previous case ) .",
    "so far we considered conditions [ cond1 ] and [ cond2 ] and we obtained , in the general @xmath0 case , that there are two possible hamiltonian classes defined by @xmath128 and @xmath124 . the transformation ( [ aff1 ] ) required to obtain @xmath118 and",
    "@xmath119 implies that the landau level operator @xmath80 has the general form ( [ eqn ] ) in terms of the operators @xmath45 and @xmath79 . for the sake of simplicity , hereafter we restrict ourself to the case @xmath129 and @xmath130 , since all the other cases can be studied using the coordinate transformation ( [ affine ] ) .",
    "therefore we will deal with generalized landau levels expressed as a finite sum of the eigenstates of @xmath78 . in this case",
    "we are reducing the previous hamiltonians to the following classes :    * the jaynes ",
    "cummings class , obtained by imposing @xmath131 , with hamiltonian @xmath132 where @xmath133 . in the limit @xmath134 this hamiltonian satisfies also the condition [ cond3 ] and it is characterized by a full @xmath0 gauge symmetry . moreover , it can be shown that the hamiltonian ( [ class1 ] ) is gauge equivalent to both a pure rashba spin  orbit coupling and a pure dresselhaus interaction .",
    "this case will be extensively discussed in the next sections where we will show that it can be described in terms of a minimal coupling with a non  abelian gauge potential . *",
    "the two  photon jaynes  cummings class , obtained by imposing @xmath135 , corresponding to @xmath136 this hamiltonian can not be described by a quadratic minimal coupling with a non  abelian gauge potential since it presents the product between quadratic terms in @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the @xmath11 matrices .",
    "however it can be exactly solved @xcite , showing a landau level structure .",
    "also in this case the condition [ cond3 ] is satisfied in the limit @xmath134 .    summarizing ,",
    "up to transformations of the spin basis , there are only three classes of hamiltonians , quadratic in the momentum , that satisfy the conditions [ cond1 ] and [ cond2 ] and can be described by generic ladder operators @xmath45 and @xmath79 .",
    "the first one is the abelian class with a @xmath18 gauge symmetry ( [ u1xu1 ] ) .",
    "the other two are characterized by a full @xmath0 gauge potential and correspond to different jaynes  cummings models .",
    "in particular we will restrict to the case in which @xmath45 and @xmath79 correspond to @xmath30 and @xmath31 and we will focus , in the following sections , on the class ( [ class1 ] ) in the limit of @xmath0 gauge symmetry , fulfilling also the condition [ cond3 ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the physical implementation in a rotating tripod system of the non - abelian gauge potential @xmath137 ( the identity matrix @xmath61 will be dropped in the following ) .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath138 as discussed in the previous section , the vector potential ( [ eq1 ] ) is representative of a much more general class of single  particle systems ( [ class1 ] ) characterized by the properties [ cond1 ] - [ cond3 ] .",
    "moreover the non  abelian term of ( [ eq1 ] ) mimics the effect of a spin  orbit coupling and it can be shown to be gauge equivalent both to the dresselhaus and to the rashba coupling .",
    "the vector potential ( [ eq1 ] ) is constituted by a @xmath17 term proportional to the parameter @xmath15 , quantifying the strength of the non  abelian term , and by the magnetic contribution : @xmath24 describes a proper @xmath0 potential whose total effective magnetic field is @xmath139 where @xmath140 is proportional to the commutator of the covariant derivatives .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath140 does not depend on the position so that the system is characterized by a translationally invariant wilson loop as in the cases analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the effect of a constant magnetic field can be reproduced in a rotating frame thanks to the coriolis force ( see , for example , @xcite ) ; at variance , the @xmath17 contribution can be obtained through proper optical couplings in a system of atoms showing quasi - degenerate ground  states as described in @xcite . therefore , to engineer the effective gauge potential @xmath141 ( [ eq1 ] ) , we will consider a rotating system of the so - called tripod atoms whose coupling is described in @xcite and depends on the rabi frequencies @xmath142 @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are functions of the position and of the parameter @xmath15 , while the angles @xmath146 and @xmath147 and @xmath148 are chosen constants .",
    "these frequencies describe the couplings of three quasi - degenerate ground  states , characterized by different hyperfine levels , with an excited state .",
    "this interaction give rise to two different dark states whose dynamics is described by the effective hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with vector potential given by ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "such dark states constitute the different pseudospin component @xmath149 , @xmath150 coupled by the non  abelian term in @xmath38 .    in the following",
    "we determine the dependence of the frequencies @xmath142 on @xmath15 to obtain , through a proper gauge transformation , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) for the atomic gas in a rotating frame .",
    "let us consider first a system of tripod atoms in an inertial frame of reference characterized by a non  abelian gauge potential @xmath151 , a scalar potential @xmath152 as the one described in @xcite and a harmonic confining potential @xmath153 where @xmath154 ( notice that we are working in units in which @xmath23 ) .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath155 once the whole system is put in rotation with angular velocity @xmath2 , the hamiltonian in the rotating frame of reference reads @xcite @xmath156 where we introduced the gauge invariant angular momentum @xmath157 and all the coordinates are now considered in the rotating frame .",
    "it is useful to rewrite @xmath158 introducing the gauge potential @xmath159 where we imposed @xmath160 .",
    "we obtain @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
    "our aim is to identify the correct family of rabi frequencies , @xmath163 and gauge transformations such that the hamiltonian @xmath158 can be cast in the form @xmath164 with @xmath6 given by ( [ eq1 ] ) and @xmath165 being the usual angular momentum in the rotating frame .",
    "as we will show in section [ angular ] , @xmath166 can be exactly solved and , in the limit @xmath167 , it becomes the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "in particular we need to have @xmath168 in order to obtain , in the rotating frame , the potential @xmath6 in ( [ eq1 ] ) starting from the potential @xmath169 @xmath170 given in @xcite , we need a suitable unitary gauge transformation @xmath171 @xcite .",

    "the deformed mr pfaffian state can be described by an effective @xmath471-wave pairing @xcite obtained by applying the operator @xmath472 which favours a symmetric state ( with respect to @xmath268 and @xmath469 ) for the pair @xmath463 when @xmath370 .",
    "the corresponding wavefunction is @xcite @xmath473 where @xmath474 is the pfaffian operator .",

    "equation ( [ eqmr2 ] ) guarantees that also the statistics of the excitations @xmath479 and @xmath480 of the kind @xmath481 can be described by ising anyons as in the case of the moore and read state , since the berry and monodromy phases acquired in the exchange of two excitations coincide .    the other paired ground ",
    "state at @xmath406 is a deformed haldane - rezayi state that can be obtained through the introduction of the antisymmetric operator @xmath482 : @xmath483 this state has a total angular momentum @xmath447 which is lower than the one of @xmath475 so that , in principle , it is energetically favoured if we consider the single - particle hamiltonian ( [ eqh ] ) .",
    "however the haldane - rezayi state represents the critical point between a weak and a strong coupling phase in a fermionic system with an effective @xmath297-wave pairing @xcite , therefore it is considered to be a gapless state whose excitations are described by a non  unitary conformal field theory @xcite which is unfit to define an incompressible state .",
    "moreover we expect that @xmath484 is more influenced by the presence of a weak inter ",
    "species interaction than @xmath475 .    to conclude the discussion about the ( free ) fermionic gases it is worth noticing that all the states presented can be retrieved also for the generic degeneracy point between states in @xmath427 and @xmath429 by substituting the operators @xmath277 and @xmath485 with @xmath383 and @xmath486 .",
    "this is true in the case of free fermions ( i.e. , with @xmath343 ) , whereas the introduction of strong interactions , such as an inter  species contact repulsion , brings to different scenarios presenting deformed halperin states , similar to the one we will present for the bosonic gases , whose exponents and filling factors depend also on the value of @xmath80 .",
    "the analysis of the degenerate points can be applied also to bosonic gases .",
    "as described in section [ gener ] , the state @xmath487 ( [ generlaughlin ] ) is a ground  state of both the intra  species and the inter ",

    "the exponents of the jastrow factors are defined considering that the lowest polynomial order term for an atom in @xmath449 is given by the first derivative included in @xmath277 , whereas in @xmath13 by the second derivative in @xmath485 .",
    "therefore @xmath491 vanishes at least as @xmath492 whenever @xmath370 for each pair of atoms , and the intra ",
    "species interaction energy is zero .",
    "@xmath491 is characterized by a filling factor @xmath493 and it is built by the symmetrization of the halperin state @xmath494 .",
    "the interaction term between atoms in different clusters is determined in order to satisfy the zero interaction energy constraint @xmath495 the @xmath491 filling factor , @xmath496 , is therefore the highest possible filling factor that guarantees a null interaction energy for bosons at the point @xmath16 .",
    "we conclude this section observing that considering different degeneracy points , @xmath497 , the ground states for intra  species repulsions are defined as deformed halperin states @xmath498 characterized by lower filling factors .",
    "so far we considered the non  abelian component of the potential at the exact value @xmath499 which is characterized by a perfect degeneracy of the deformed landau levels @xmath250 and @xmath264 .",
    "then the population of atoms must be equally distributed into these levels in order to minimize the total angular momentum of the system and thus its total energy . however , if the parameter @xmath426 is slightly detuned from these degeneracy points , the deformed landau level with a lower energy will present an increase in population balancing the small energy difference arising between the two state families .",
    "let us consider , in particular , a system showing a filling factor @xmath500 on the @xmath226 landau level , and let us suppose that @xmath426 is slightly higher than @xmath501 , so that @xmath502 . to fill the gap between @xmath250 and @xmath264",
    "there must be an imbalance @xmath503 between the population of atoms in @xmath264 and @xmath504 , such that @xmath505 considering the energy eigenvalues given by equation ( [ energyl ] ) , one obtains @xmath506 where @xmath507 is the displacement of @xmath426 from the degeneracy point : we assumed @xmath508 in the second approximation done in equation ( [ emme ] ) . in order to obtain a system described by the deformed hall states defined above for the degeneracy point at @xmath16",
    ", the imbalance @xmath509 must be negligible with respect to the total number of atoms @xmath325 and , in particular , one obtains the following degeneracy condition on the displacement @xmath507 around @xmath510 : @xmath511 where @xmath460 is the total filling factor of the system and the further constraint for @xmath512 is derived from the energy difference with the third landau level , @xmath513 , in such a way that all the atoms lie only in the two lower landau levels . if @xmath507 exceeds the limit ( [ crossover ] ) , the imbalance @xmath509 grows up until only the population in the lower landau level is left .",
    "therefore the displacement @xmath507 drives a crossover between different regimes characterized by wavefunctions in @xmath250 and @xmath264 such as the deformed laughlin states in ( [ generlaughlin ] ) and only in the regime defined by the condition ( [ crossover ] ) hall states presenting particles in both the deformed landau levels can be present .",
    "we studied two  component ultracold bosonic and fermionic atomic gases in @xmath0 non  abelian potentials .",
    "we focused our attention to gauge potentials having , in the abelian limit , doubly degenerate landau levels deriving from an abelian magnetic field equal for both the components .",
    "we investigated the effect of general homogeneous non  abelian terms , discussing the conditions under which the structure of degenerate landau levels is preserved ( even if the spin degeneracy is split by the coupling between the internal states realized by the non  abelian term ) .",
    "we argued that there are only three classes of ( quadratic ) hamiltonians preserving the degeneracy of the landau levels and giving rise to an analytically defined landau level structure , where the eigenstates are expressed as a finite linear combination of the eigenstates of a particle in a magnetic field .",
    "the first class corresponds to an abelian @xmath18 gauge potential and it refers to uncoupled internal states , whereas the other two are characterized by a truly non ",
    "abelian @xmath0 gauge potential and correspond to different kinds of jaynes  cummings models .    focusing on one of these jaynes  cummings classes which is gauge equivalent both to a rashba and to a dresselhaus spin  orbit coupling , we determined the single  particle energy spectrum and we discussed the parameters of the rabi pulses needed for the physical implementation of such gauge potentials .",
    "it is found that the single  particle energy levels assume the same values in a series of degeneracy points .",
    "the corresponding deformed quantum hall states for fermions and bosons ( in the presence of strong intra ",
    "species interaction ) have been determined through a mapping to the usual quantum hall laughlin states .",
    "such mapping preserves the berry phases characterizing the exchanges of quasi  holes and , therefore , the abelian excitation statistics .",
    "far from the degeneracy points , deformed laughlin states are found ; whereas , at the crossing points of the lowest landau levels , ground  states with non  abelian excitations emerge at different fillings . a detailed discussion of the properties of the resulting deformed moore ",
    "read states and of the state @xmath445 ( minimizing the total angular momentum ) was presented ; besides , the crossover arising at the degeneracy points was investigated , estimating the range of the hamiltonian parameters for the validity of these many  body ground states .",
    "the effect of an angular moment term on the stability of the landau level structure and of the deformed laughlin states was analyzed and we provided an estimate of the values of the angular momentum such that the landau level description of the multiparticle states remains accurate .",
    "we also gave results for @xmath1 gauge potentials acting on a three  component gas , pointing out that it is possible to have lines of degeneracy points of the landau levels and triple degeneracies in the spectrum .",
    "it would be interesting in the future to study the transport properties of the quantum hall states found for ultracold atoms in @xmath0 artificial gauge potentials preserving the landau levels , especially in view of the experimental study of the signatures of the different hall states .",
    "from this point of view , we mention that it could be useful to study setups in which the abelian terms are different for the two components .",
    "another related issue , important for the experimental detection of non  abelian states , would be also the investigation of the physical addressability of such states , e.g. how the filling of these states depends on the experimental parameters . equally important would be the estimation of haldane pseudopotentials relevant to address the effect of more general interacting terms like inter  species repulsions and dipolar long  range interactions .",
