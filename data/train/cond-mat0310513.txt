    "in many real - world networks which evolve in time , the number of links show a nonlinear growth in time @xcite .",
    "examples of such network are the internet @xcite , world wide web ( www ) @xcite , collaboration @xcite , word web @xcite , citation @xcite , metabolism @xcite , gene regulatory network @xcite etc .",
    "the number of links may increase in a two - fold way : new nodes may tend to get attached to more nodes as the size of the network increases , and secondly there may be additional links generated between the older nodes in a non - linear fashion as shown in fig .",
    "these two factors maybe present either singly or simultaneously resulting in the accelerated growth . in some networks like the citation and the gene regulatory network ,",
    "new links between older nodes are forbidden and therefore only the first scheme is valid , while in collaboration network or internet , the second factor is dominating .",
    "the case when the new node gets a fixed number of links but older nodes get new links in a non - linear fashion has been considered in both isotropic and directed models of growing networks @xcite , showing that it is distinct from networks with a linear growth rule . here , the number of links generated between the older nodes is considered to have a power law growth in time .",
    "this choice is made because the assumption that scale - free behaviour ( which is a desirable feature of networks ) is present in a network with accelerated growth has been argued to be consistent with a power - law growth of links @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the networks in these models of accelerated growth was made using a preferential attachment scheme as in the barabsi - albert network ( ba ) @xcite . in the directed network , this rule is modified by allowing an additional parameter , the initial attractiveness , in the attachment rule @xcite .",
    "there is also an alternative way of achieving a scale - free network proposed by huberman and adamic @xcite which has been used for modelling the internet network with accelerated growth@xcite .",
    "the preferential attachment scheme in the original ba network is the simple rule that the incoming nodes get attached to the @xmath14th node according to the probability @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the degree ( number of coonections ) of the @xmath14th node .",
    "this leads to the result that the number of links @xmath7 is distributed according to @xmath17 for large k. let the @xmath14th node be introduced at time @xmath5 .",
    "usually one node at a time is introduced such that @xmath18 .",
    "the degree of the @xmath14th node at a later time @xmath1 is then denoted by @xmath19 , which in the ba model can be estimated as @xmath20^{\\beta}.\\ ] ]    in general , the exponent @xmath21 describes the variation of @xmath22 with @xmath23 , however in the case of the ba model , the behaviour with @xmath1 is also given by the same exponent .",
    "the values of the exponents can be obtained in the ba model exactly : @xmath24 and @xmath25 , satisfying the relation @xmath26 .",
    "this relation holds good in a more generalised version of the ba model as well @xcite . in the ba network",
    ", the incoming node gets a fixed number of links @xmath27 and the characteristics of the network do not depend on the specific value of @xmath27 .",
    "no new link between older nodes is allowed .",
    "the models of accelerated growth considered so far assume that older nodes get new links ( scheme ( b ) in fig .",
    "1 ) , which is a sufficient departure from the original barabsi - albert model . we consider the simpler case where the number of outgoing links @xmath0 is no longer a constant but a function of time and no new link between older nodes is allowed ( scheme ( a ) of fig .",
    "this is also a realistic scheme as one can expect the number of attachments of a new node to increase when it is exposed to a larger environment .",
    "we have considered both deterministic and stochastic rules governing the form of @xmath0 .",
    "the focus of the present paper is on the behaviour of the various degree distributions in the networks with accelerated growth .",
    "a brief discussion of the clustering properties of the networks have also been made .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath28 measures the number of links between the neighbours of the @xmath14th node .",
    "here we have estimated the average clustering coefficient @xmath29 in a network evolved upto time @xmath1 ( equal to the number of nodes ) and also the the average clustering coefficient @xmath30 of nodes with degree @xmath7 .",
    "these quantities have been shown to have interesting properties in networks @xcite .    in section ii , the deterministic picture is discussed where the number of outgoing links increases in time in a deterministic manner and in section iii , stochastic models are considered in which the number of outgoing links is a random variable . in the last section ,",
    "the results are summarised and discussed .",
    "let the number of nodes in a growing network be @xmath3 at time @xmath1 . in the deterministic model ,",
    "we take the number of outgoing links available to an incoming node to be @xmath31 . in a network",
    "which is grown by introducing one node at a time , @xmath32 , and therefore @xmath33 , ensuring an accelerated growth in the number of links in the network .",
    "the links are made according to equation ( 1 ) as usual .",
    "one can obtain an expression for @xmath22 and @xmath11 using a continuum theory following @xcite . here",
    "the rate of change of @xmath22 is taken proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "going to the continuum limit the total number of links is @xmath35 at time @xmath1 , and the equation governing @xmath22 takes the form @xmath36 leading to @xmath37 ^{(1+\\theta)/2}.\\ ] ] in the last equation the boundary condition @xmath38 has been inserted . from the above equation , we find that @xmath39 . that @xmath22 is not a function of @xmath40 alone",
    "is a result significantly different from the ba network .",
    "the degree distribution at time @xmath1 shows the following behaviour : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the value of @xmath43 is therefore given by @xmath44    in this model , there are two known limits : @xmath45 corresponds to the ba model and @xmath46 corresponds to a fully connected network ( i.e. , an @xmath47-clique ) . for the ba model ,",
    "the degree distribution is a power - law distribution while for the fully connected network , @xmath11 is a delta function .",
    "this implies the possibility of the existence of a ` critical ' @xmath48 where a peak occurs in the degree distribution for the first time .",
    "we conduct numerical simulations to explore this possibility .    in the simulation , nodes are added one by one .",
    "a specific number of links are assigned to each incoming node ( @xmath33 : the nearest integer is chosen ) and links are made by the preferential attachment scheme . for larger values of @xmath8",
    "the network becomes highly connected and it takes a lot of time to generate it .",
    "hence we restrict to values of @xmath49 and to times @xmath50 ; the latter is also the size of the network .",
    "the results show complete agreement with the analytical results as far as the decay of the degree distribution for large @xmath7 is concerned ( fig .",
    "a growth of the distribution for small @xmath7 values is noted as well .",
    "this growth seems to be faster than exponential as @xmath8 is made larger .",
    "this fast growth suggests that the form of @xmath11 maybe assumed to be @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the value at which @xmath11 is maximum .",
    "the normalisation of @xmath11 can then be done by making @xmath53 . substituting @xmath11 from equation ( 6 ) and following the above normalisation procedure , we get an estimate of @xmath52 as a function of @xmath1 , which is precisely @xmath54 for large @xmath1",
    ". the numerical results for discrete systems also agree with the above scaling , the agreement becoming better for larger values of @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , we find that a peak is present in the degree distribution even for values of @xmath55 which indicates the existence of @xmath48 . analysing the numerical results for small values of @xmath8",
    ", we find that the peak in the distribution occurs as soon as @xmath8 is made non - zero .",
    "this is established by the fact that as the network size is made larger ( i.e. , the time to which the network is evolved is made larger ) the peak becomes sharper and @xmath11 decreases for small @xmath7 values .",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath56 .",
    "although in this network @xmath11 has been calculated from the total degree of the nodes , we notice an interesting behaviour of the distributions of the in - degree @xmath57 and out - degree @xmath58 taken separately .",
    "it maybe mentioned here that these distributions have also been obtained for real networks and in many of them it is seen that these are also scale - free with distinct exponents @xcite .",
    "the number of outgoing links in the present network is deterministic and has the following feature : the first @xmath59 nodes have out - degree 1 , the next @xmath60 have out - degree 2 and so on ( this is due to the discrete nature of the network ) . for @xmath61 ,",
    "all nodes have out - degree 1 and its distribution @xmath62 is a delta function ( @xmath59 equals the number of nodes in the system and all @xmath63 for @xmath64 ) . for @xmath65 , @xmath66 etc",
    ". , and the out - degree distribution is a flat one . for intermediate values of @xmath8 , the exact form of @xmath67 can be easily found out .",
    "let @xmath1 be the first time when the out - degree of the incoming node is @xmath58 and @xmath68 the time at which the out - degree increases to @xmath69 .",
    "clearly @xmath70 and since @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 .",
    "therefore @xmath73 hence we find that the out - degree distribution actually grows with the degree , a result which is also verified in the numerical simulations ( fig .",
    "3 ) . since for @xmath74",
    ", the out - degree never assumes a very large value in a network of finite size , we also note that for large @xmath7 , the contribution to @xmath11 is mainly from @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , we expect that @xmath75 will have a power - law tail with @xmath43 given by equation ( 7 ) .",
    "this is also confirmed numerically .",
    "the growing region of the total degree distribution for small @xmath7 is accounted for by the growing out - degree distribution as in this region both @xmath57 and @xmath58 contribute .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath22 is also in complete agreement with the theoretical results : plotting the scaled @xmath76 against @xmath5 for different values of @xmath1 , a data collapse is obtained .",
    "this is shown in fig . 4 for @xmath77 .",
    "the agreement with the continuum results becomes better as @xmath5 increases .",
    "all clustering coeffcients at @xmath78 are zero as no loops are allowed in this case .",
    "as @xmath8 is increased , @xmath29 ( with fixed @xmath1 ) shows an increase as expected .",
    "the increase is not very sharp at small values of @xmath8 , e.g. , for @xmath8 as high as 0.5 , @xmath79 for @xmath80 . since @xmath81 for @xmath82",
    ", it is expected that @xmath29 will show a sharper increase for larger values of @xmath8 ; it is however difficult to simulate networks in this range of values of @xmath8 to check this behaviour .",
    "@xmath29 as a function of @xmath1 shows a behaviour similar to the ba model ; it decreases with @xmath1 ( at least upto @xmath77 ; we have not studied this variation beyond this value ) .",
    "this decrease is also expected to have a dependence on @xmath8 ( in the limit @xmath82 , @xmath29 is independent of @xmath1 ) . we have not , however , attempted to study in detail the dependence of @xmath29 with @xmath1 as @xmath8 is varied .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath30 when @xmath1 is kept fixed which again shows a behaviour similar to the ba model for large values of @xmath7 , i.e. , for non - zero values of @xmath8 , @xmath30 becomes a constant .",
    "this constant is a function of @xmath8 and we find that @xmath83 for large @xmath7 gives a good fit to the data .",
    "the assumption that an incoming node gets attached to a fixed number of nodes at a given time in the deterministic model is somewhat artificial . in most social networks ,",
    "the outgoing links also have a distribution which usually shows a decay @xcite .",
    "hence one should consider randomness in the number of outgoing links in a realistic manner such that the number of outgoing links @xmath84 is not fixed at time @xmath1 but is a stochastic variable .",
    "in fact , @xmath84 can be a stochastic variable even in the conventional ba model by not putting any restriction on the number of outgoing links .",
    "this can be achieved by simply allowing each existing node the possibility to get attached to the incoming node according to the probability given in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "however , it is known that making @xmath84 random in this way does not change the ba universality class .",
    "this happens because even though @xmath84 is random , @xmath85 , the mean value is practically independent of time .",
    "thus it is possible to replace @xmath27 by @xmath85 in the rate equation for @xmath22 @xcite and get the same results as in the ba model .",
    "such a replacement is meaningful as long as the fluctuations are negligible which is true in the unrestricted ba case .",
    "this we have checked by numerical simulations also .    to get a stochastic model in which @xmath86 is a function of time , we let @xmath0 follow a distribution which depends on the number of nodes @xmath3 present at that time . the choice of the distribution can be done in many ways .",
    "however , we find that in many real networks , where the distribution of the out - degree has been done , the distribution shows either a power law ( e.g. the www or phone - call network ) or an exponential ( e.g. as in the citation network ) tail @xcite .",
    "this study has been done in networks evolved for a sufficient duration of time , here we assume that the same kind of distribution is valid for intermediate times .",
    "the dependence on the number of nodes present in the system at time @xmath1 occurs by putting the upper bound of @xmath0 equal to @xmath3 .",
    "taking an exponentially decaying distribution of @xmath0 , however , again gives nothing new .",
    "this is because the mean value @xmath87 becomes time independent ( within a short time ) and therefore we get the ba network again .",
    "thus we focus our attention on the model in which @xmath0 follows a power law distribution , i.e. , @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "again we take @xmath32 , i.e. , one node is being added at a time .    in this model",
    "@xmath90 will have the following behaviour :    @xmath91    assuming that @xmath84 can be replaced by its mean @xmath92 , the continuum theory discussed in the last section can be used for the stochastic model as well once we define an effective @xmath8 from the above equations .",
    "thus @xmath93 for @xmath94 , @xmath95 for @xmath96 , and for @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "we should not , however , expect this ` continuum mean field theory ' to be valid if the fluctuations are not negligible .",
    "an estimate of the fluctuation in @xmath84 can also be made which shows that it increases as @xmath99 decreases and can not be neglected for @xmath100 .",
    "we use numerical simulations to find out the validity of the ` continuum mean field theory ' in the stochastic models .",
    "plotting @xmath11 vs. @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "5 ) for several values of @xmath12 , we find that for large values of @xmath99 it is indeed ba - like . as @xmath12",
    "is decreased it deviates from the power law behaviour .",
    "it is difficult to locate the exact value of @xmath99 where the change in behaviour occurs , but clearly , the scale - free behaviour observed for @xmath13 is no longer valid for values of @xmath12 above 2 but less than 3 . for @xmath101 , the fluctuations ( @xmath102 ) scale like @xmath103 , which means that it becomes stronger for large @xmath3 and for @xmath12 closer to 2 . increasing @xmath3 to large values",
    "is difficult as it takes a long time to generate the network .",
    "so we analyse the behaviour of @xmath11 for @xmath12 close to 2 , e.g. at @xmath104 and @xmath105 , to check the role of fluctuations . for both these values",
    ", the behaviour of @xmath11 agrees better with a stretched exponential behaviour : @xmath106 albeit with very small values of @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) . for @xmath109 ,",
    "the deviation from power law is quite clear .",
    "as @xmath12 is made smaller than 2 , the behaviour of @xmath11 is no longer monotonic and for small values of @xmath7 it can be fitted to a stretched exponential function with @xmath107 depending on @xmath12 .",
    "the range of @xmath7 over which @xmath11 follows a stretched exponential behaviour shrinks beyond @xmath110 where it shows a sharp drop ( see for instance the curves for @xmath111 and @xmath112 in fig .",
    "6 ) .    for values of @xmath113 ,",
    "the fluctuations increase rapidly and the network takes very long time to be generated as it becomes more and more clustered .",
    "@xmath11 shows a slow decay for @xmath114 over a long range of @xmath7 and drops sharply as @xmath7 approaches the total number of nodes in the network .",
    "the distribution becomes flatter as @xmath99 is decreased .",
    "below @xmath115 , a weakly growing region emerges .",
    "in fact , a peak appears and becomes sharper as @xmath12 is made smaller .",
    "the position of the peak , as @xmath1 is made larger , also shifts towards larger @xmath7 , e.g. , for @xmath116 , the peak is at @xmath117 for @xmath118 and at @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "a systematic study demands a very large amount of computer time and we have not attempted it . nor",
    "do we try to fit the data to any familiar form because of the large amount of fluctuations .    as in case of the deterministic network , here too one can find out the individual distributions @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "as expected , @xmath121 shows a power law decay with exponent @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath123 almost coincides with the total degree distribution as the network becomes larger .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath22 has also been studied in this network .",
    "again we find a deviation from the power law behaviour as @xmath99 becomes less than 3 .",
    "as @xmath12 is made smaller , @xmath22 becomes flat as expected .",
    "the clustering coefficients have been estimated in this model as well .",
    "@xmath29 as a function of @xmath12 shows a increase as @xmath12 is decreased as expected ( e.g , for @xmath124 , @xmath125 and for @xmath126 , @xmath127 for @xmath128 ) . as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath29 shows a decrease with @xmath1 for @xmath129 .",
    "however , as @xmath12 is made smaller , for the values of @xmath130 at least , @xmath29 shows an increase with @xmath1 .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath29 becomes independent of @xmath1 for large @xmath1 values for @xmath131 . here",

    "both @xmath135 and @xmath107 approach zero for very large @xmath12 . as @xmath12 is decreased both @xmath135 and @xmath107 increase indicating a larger value of @xmath30 together with a sharper decay .",
    "we have considered both deterministic and stochastic models of growing networks with preferential attachment in which the number of outgoing links is a function of time . in both models we have followed simple rules of evolution with a single tunable parameter .",
    "the main results obtained in the deterministic model are : + 1 .",

    "+ 2 . a growing region in @xmath11 for small @xmath7",

    "they satisfy the relation @xmath26 as in a general ba model .",

    "it is not a function of @xmath40 as in the ba model .",

    "the mean field theory predicts a transition at @xmath138 above which it becomes ba - like .",
    "the numerical simulations show that for @xmath139 the degree distribution is scale - free with @xmath24 .",
    "the degree distribution loses its power law decay nature at values of @xmath140 and assumes a stretched exponential form : @xmath141 .",
    "however , the deviation from the scale - free behaviour is marginal , as indicated by the low value of @xmath107 in the region @xmath142 .",
    "hence this maybe a correction to the ba scaling and therefore it may not be correct to conclude that a phase transition has occurred at @xmath143 .",
    "clearcut inconsistency with the mean field theory is observed for smaller values of @xmath12 when the stretched exponential behaviour of @xmath11 becomes more pronounced .",
    "for very small values of @xmath12 , a weakly growing region in @xmath11 emerges .",
    "the data , with a lot of fluctuations , is difficult to handle in this region .",
    "however , this region is not of much interest to us as for real networks , such small @xmath12 values seem unrealistic .",

    "the degree distribution is stationary while for small @xmath12 ( presumably for @xmath144 ) it becomes dependent on the size of the network . +",
    "a straightforward comparison of the above two models shows that the stochastic model is closer to real world networks .",
    "this is concluded from comparison with real world data : the out - degree distributions in phone call , citation etc .",
    "networks show a decay , either power law or exponential , while in the deterministic model , we find a growing behaviour .",
    "even though we get a power law decay of @xmath11 in the deterministic model , the exponent @xmath43 is always @xmath145 while in most real networks , it is closer to 2 and can be even less than 2 .",
    "the stochastic model on the other hand has a out - degree distribution which shows a power law decay .",
    "it also shows that the scale - free behaviour can vanish even in a growing network with preferential attachment .",
    "in fact the stretched exponential behaviour of the degree distribution observed for small degrees is reminiscent of the behaviour of the degree distribution in citation network @xcite .",
    "the stochastic model is also of theoretical interest as it indicates the existence of transitions at finite values of @xmath12 .",
    "however , the deterministic model has its own merits : it is easy to construct and a number of results for it can be obtained analytically in the continuum limit .",
    "the peak obtained in the total degree distribution in this model may be compared to similar peaks obtained in some real world networks e.g. , the co - authorship network @xcite or the indian railways network @xcite .",
    "the citation network is perhaps the most appropriate network which the stochastic model emulates .",
    "however , the citation network is essentially a directed network .",
    "therefore we have also considered a specific directed model in the stochastic case , which follows the attachment rule as in @xcite and where @xmath146 has a peak and an exponential decay @xcite .",
    "the results show that it has a power law decay in the in - degree distribution with @xmath147 ( not much different from the case when there is no accelerated growth @xcite ) .",
    "there are some available data on citation network @xcite but the data and the analyses are not sufficiently general to compare with simulation data . in this context",
    "it may be mentioned that in a model to simulate the gene regulatory network , which is a directed network with accelerated growth , the outgoing links also show a power law with exponent close to 2 in good agreement with theory @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have tried to construct models of accelerated growth where the number of outgoing links increase with the network size following certain prescriptions .",
    "a continuum theory can be formulated for the deterministic case which can be applied in the stochastic case in the mean field limit . based on the different results obtained in the models we conclude that the stochastic model is closer to real - world networks .",

    "<S> in several real - world networks like the internet , www etc . , the number of links grow in time in a non - linear fashion . </S>",
    "<S> we consider growing networks in which the number of outgoing links is a non - linear function of time but new links between older nodes are forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> the attachments are made using a preferential attachment scheme . in the deterministic picture , the number of outgoing links @xmath0 at any time @xmath1 is taken as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of nodes present at that time . the continuum theory predicts a power law decay of the degree distribution : @xmath4 , while the degree of the node introduced at time @xmath5 is given by @xmath6^{\\frac { 1+\\theta}{2}}$ ] when the network is evolved till time @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show a growth in the degree distribution for small @xmath7 values at any non - zero @xmath8 . in the stochastic picture </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath0 is a random variable . </S>",
    "<S> as long as @xmath9 is independent of time , the network shows a behaviour similar to the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model . </S>",
    "<S> different results are obtained when @xmath9 is time - dependent , e.g. , when @xmath0 follows a distribution @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of @xmath11 changes significantly as @xmath12 is varied : for @xmath13 , the network has a scale - free distribution belonging to the ba class as predicted by the mean field theory , for smaller values of @xmath12 it shows different behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic features of the clustering coefficients in both models have also been discussed .    </S>",
