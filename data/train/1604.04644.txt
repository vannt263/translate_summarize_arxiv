    "quantum teleportation is a quantum communication task devised to transfer the quantum state of a physical system located at one place , say alice s , to a different quantum system located at bob s @xcite .",
    "two important aspects of the teleportation protocol are related to the fact that it works without the knowledge of the quantum state to be teleported and that the physical system originally described by this quantum state is not sent from alice to bob . for the perfect functioning of the teleportation protocol alice and bob",
    "need to share a maximally entangled state ( maximally entangled quantum channel ) . in this case",
    "the protocol works deterministically and with unity fidelity , i.e. , every run of the protocol ends up with bob s system being described exactly by the original state teleported by alice .",
    "the requirement of a maximally entangled quantum channel connecting alice and bob is very difficult to achieve or maintain in practice since the inevitable presence of noise reduces the entanglement of the quantum state shared between them . in practical implementations of the teleportation protocol one can either adopt entanglement distillation techniques @xcite or modify the original protocol in order to cope with the reduced level of entanglement @xcite . in the first case alice and bob need to share several copies of partially entangled states before implementing an entanglement distillation protocol , whereby they obtain a maximally entangled state at the expenses of many copies of partially entangled ones . with this maximally entangled state , alice and bob are able to execute with success the original teleportation protocol . in the second case",
    ", the partially entangled state is used as is and the protocol is modified in order to achieve the greatest fidelity possible . in this last case , we can divide all strategies in two groups . in the first group we have the deterministic protocols and in the second group the probabilistic ones .    the deterministic protocols",
    "@xcite do not postselect any measurement outcome at alice s and therefore are always `` successful '' in the sense that any run of the protocol yields an output state to bob , even if his state is not exactly described by the original ( input ) state with alice .",
    "the probabilistic protocols , on the other hand , are not always successful as defined above since only certain measurement outcomes obtained by alice are accepted . in the probabilistic protocols",
    "only those measurement outcomes leading to output states closest to the input are considered valid . in this way , by decreasing the success rate of the protocol one increases the fidelity of the state with bob ( output ) with respect to the input state @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the probabilistic protocols given in refs . @xcite",
    "assume the non - maximally entangled state shared between alice and bob to be pure .    in this article",
    "we want to extensively study probabilistic teleportation protocols where the quantum channel connecting alice and bob are given by partially entangled mixed states .",
    "our benchmarks are the optimal deterministic protocols given in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , we want to find situations in which the reduction of the success rate ( postselection ) of the protocols in ref .",
    "@xcite gives considerable improvements in the fidelity of the teleported state .",
    "being more specific , here we deal with several scenarios involving the four most common types of noise one faces when implementing a quantum communication protocol : the bit flip , the phase flip or phase damping , the depolarizing , and the amplitude damping noises .",
    "we also study situations in which the state to be teleported is also subjected to noise .",
    "we show that several of the interesting results obtained in @xcite for the deterministic protocols are also present in the probabilistic case .",
    "for example , we show scenarios where more noise increases the fidelity of the teleported state and where the entanglement of the quantum channel connecting alice and bob giving the greatest fidelity is not maximal .",
    "in addition to this , we show that there exist situations in which the probabilistic protocol outperforms the deterministic one in a very important aspect .",
    "indeed , we show that there are scenarios where the optimal fidelity for the probabilistic protocol is not only greater than the optimal one for the deterministic protocol , but the only one surpassing the maximal value achievable by using only classical resources .",
    "this fact is a clear indication that in some scenarios a truly quantum teleportation can only be obtained by using probabilistic protocols .",
    "the mathematical concept needed to deal with noise and mixed states is the density matrix and thus the first thing we need to do is to recast the original teleportation protocol using density matrices .",
    "this was done in full detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and here we only give the key results necessary for the development of the ideas and concepts related to the probabilistic teleportation protocol .",

    "the initially noiseless entangled state shared between alice and bob , @xmath6 , has the following density matrix in the base @xmath7 , @xmath8 here @xmath9 means `` channel '' and the first and second qubits are with alice and bob , respectively .",

    "[ fig4 ] we compare the optimal efficiency for a fixed type of noise acting on the input qubit among all possibilities of noise acting on the quantum channel .",
    "the greatest efficiency occurs when all qubits suffer the amplitude damping noise .",

    "( color online ) optimal efficiencies ( average fidelities ) as a function of @xmath110 for the deterministic protocol when only the quantum channel is subjected to the amplitude damping noise ( circle - black curves ) and for the deterministic ( square - red curves ) and probabilistic ( star - blue curves ) protocols when all three qubits are subjected to the amplitude damping noise .",
    "the dashed - black curves mark the classical limit @xmath0 for the fidelity .",
    "the optimal efficiencies for the probabilistic protocol are those obtained by postselecting @xmath19 .",
    "for the two panels above , the success rate @xmath144 is never lower than @xmath145 in the whole range of @xmath110.,width=321 ]    a very interesting noise arrangement is the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , in which all qubits are acted on by the amplitude damping noise ( we continue to assume @xmath124 ) .",
    "the first thing worth noticing is that we can always find a @xmath80 such that @xmath146 for any value of @xmath110 and @xmath128 , i.e , the probabilistic protocol always outperforms the deterministic protocol under the same noise arrangements .",
    "we have also noticed that the optimal @xmath147 is always greater than the optimal @xmath148 .",
    "another feature of this noise arrangement is related to the fact that @xmath149 for the whole range of @xmath110 whenever @xmath150 ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . for values of @xmath151",
    "we can also have the probabilistic protocol beating the deterministic protocol with no noise acting on the input qubit .",
    "this only happens , however , when @xmath110 is small ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "last , for certain values of @xmath128 and @xmath110 , the optimal parameters @xmath10 and @xmath20 for a given postselected measurement result also yield high average fidelities for other two possible measurement outcomes , high enough to beat the optimal one of the deterministic protocol .",
    "in such cases alice and bob can considerably increase the rate of success of the probabilistic protocol , and still outperform the efficiency of the deterministic protocol , by postselecting @xmath152 out of @xmath77 measurement results .      in this scenario the two qubits with alice",
    "are acted on by the same type of noise during the same amount of time ( @xmath103 ) and bob s qubit is subjected to the same or a different type of noise ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0]-c ) .",
    "again , we have @xmath106 possible noise arrangements with only @xmath153 out of these @xmath106 possibilities yielding probabilistic protocols with greater optimal efficiencies than the ones for the deterministic protocols .",
    "those @xmath153 cases contain the amplitude damping noise acting on bob s qubit or on alice s qubits .",
    "it is worth noticing that in this scenario there exists one case where the amplitude damping noise acts on bob s qubit without yielding a better performance for the probabilistic protocol . in this case ,",
    "where alice s qubits are acted on by the phase flip noise ( @xmath154 ) , both the probabilistic and deterministic optimal efficiencies coincide . for the other @xmath153 cases in which the amplitude damping noise is present",
    "the probabilistic protocol outperforms the deterministic one under the same noise conditions .",
    "the qualitative behavior of these @xmath153 cases as well as their most important features are similar to the ones already reported in scenario @xmath31 . in particular , the optimal initial entanglement of the quantum channel connecting alice and bob is not maximal .",
    "it is important to mention that for all scenarios shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] and studied here we obtain nontrivial probabilistic protocols , in the sense that they outperform the efficiency of the corresponding deterministic protocols , if the amplitude damping noise is present .",
    "whenever the amplitude damping noise is absent the efficiencies for the probabilistic and deterministic protocols coincide when optimizing the protocols as functions of @xmath10 and @xmath20 , i.e. , as functions of the initial entanglement of the quantum channel and of the type of projective measurement implemented by alice . in those cases where the coincidence occurs , the optimal @xmath10 is always the one leading to the greatest initial entanglement ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "however , if we work with a one parameter optimization problem ( @xmath20 ) and fix @xmath10 such that @xmath156 , we can obtain probabilistic protocols outperforming the deterministic ones for noise arrangements in which the amplitude damping noise is not present . in other words ,",
    "if we are constrained from the start to work with non - maximally entangled quantum channels connecting alice and bob , other noise arrangements that do not include the amplitude damping noise lead to nontrivial probabilistic protocols .",
    "we investigated the performance of the probabilistic ( conditional ) quantum teleportation protocol in the presence of noise .",
    "we have compared its optimal efficiency with the optimal one for the deterministic protocol under the same noise conditions .",
    "we analyzed several noise arrangements in which the qubits employed in the execution of the teleportation protocol are subjected to the most common types of noise encountered in the implementation of a quantum communication task , namely , the bit flip , the phase flip , the depolarizing , and the amplitude damping noise .    for all noise arrangements here investigated , a total of @xmath157 distinct cases , only @xmath158 cases have a probabilistic protocol with an optimal efficiency ( average fidelity ) greater than the optimal efficiency of the deterministic protocol .",
    "we observed that a necessary condition for this to happen is that at least one of the qubits employed in the teleportation protocol must be subjected to the amplitude damping noise .",
    "moreover , and similarly to the deterministic case , for those @xmath158 noise arrangements the initial entanglement ( prior to the action of noise ) of the quantum channel connecting alice and bob leading to the greatest efficiency is not maximal .",
    "this is an example where _ less _ entanglement means @xmath159 efficiency , a feature already seen for deterministic protocols @xcite .",
    "we also showed several noise arrangements where _ more _ noise means _",
    "more _ efficiency .",
    "this happens whenever the efficiency of the probabilistic protocol , in which a certain number of qubits are subjected to noise , is greater than the efficiency of the corresponding deterministic protocol with a noise arrangement where fewer qubits are acted on by noise .",
    "in addition to this we also found situations in which _ different _ noises mean _ more _ efficiency . indeed , under certain noise arrangements we showed that it is better to have the qubits subjected to different types of noise instead of the same noise in order to obtain the greatest efficiency .",
    "we observed another important feature when comparing the optimal average fidelities of the probabilistic and deterministic protocols under the same noise arrangement . in this scenario we found noise arrangements where only the probabilistic protocol surpasses the classical threshold of @xmath0 for the average fidelity .",
    "this threshold means that a teleportation protocol yielding fidelities lower than @xmath0 can be simulated using only local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "teleportation protocols with fidelities lying below this limit are not considered truly quantum @xcite .",
    "therefore , for some noise arrangements we must employ the probabilistic instead of the deterministic protocol in order to obtain a quantum teleportation that is genuinely quantum .",
    "finally , for all the protocols here investigated we noted a trade - off between the rate of success and the efficiency .",
    "indeed , the optimal protocols here reported were obtained maximizing the average fidelity without any constraint on the value of the probability of success .",
    "we can increase the rate of success , however , if we decrease the efficiency of the protocol .",
    "this is achieved by imposing a constraint on the lowest acceptable value for the probability of success .",
