    "infectious diseases are a major concern of public health because of the potentially high mortality and financial costs to health systems  @xcite . to avoid or reduce the impact of an epidemic outbreak , it is necessary to understand the mechanisms driving the spreading dynamics .",
    "the population dynamics of infectious diseases depends on the particular pathogen and on the transmission routes between individuals .",
    "airborne infections , including influenza and tuberculosis , may spread through close contacts between a host and a susceptible individual .",
    "sexual contacts on the other hand create the main route for the spread of infections such as hiv and chlamydia  @xcite .",
    "various forms of daily interactions among people thus form complex contact networks that define the potential infection routes  @xcite .",
    "these contact networks are characterised by different patterns of connectivity between the individuals and by the timings of the contact events  @xcite .",
    "previous research has provided substantial understanding of the importance of the structure of contacts ( e.g. , clustering , number of contacts  @xcite ) and of temporal correlations ( e.g. , contact times , concurrency  @xcite ) to regulate the spread of infectious diseases .",
    "however , how structural and temporal properties compete and synergistically change spreading dynamics remain not sufficiently understood  @xcite .    given the complexity and heterogeneity of contact networks in general , a dominant approach to study epidemics on dynamic networks is to numerically simulate a stochastic epidemic process .",
    "theoretical approaches however may be useful for further mechanistic understanding of epidemic dynamics and for developing efficient intervention protocols in principled ways .",
    "there are several lines of such theoretical approaches @xcite . among them",
    "is the individual - based approximation ( iba ) , also termed discrete - time markov chains , which is applicable to arbitrary contact networks .",
    "the key idea of the iba is tracking the dynamics of the probability that an individual is in a certain state ( e.g. , infected state ) .",
    "the iba has been applied on static networks to study susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis )  @xcite and susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir )  @xcite epidemic models .",
    "although the applicability of the iba is hampered by correlation between the states of different nodes , in particular between adjacent nodes @xcite , the same technique applied to dynamic contact networks may be rather accurate because the dynamics of contact networks may decorrelate the states of different nodes .",
    "individual - based methods have been applied for understanding the physics of the sis epidemics on dynamic networks , in combination with synthetic adaptive networks @xcite and network data extended with the temporal periodic boundary condition @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we develop the iba for the susceptible - infected - recovered model on dynamic contact networks as observed on real settings .",
    "our model describes a broad class of infectious diseases , such as measles , chickenpox , and ebola , where hosts develop immunity or die after a given infectious period  @xcite .",
    "we use our framework to estimate the dynamics of macroscopic epidemiological variables such as the time - dependent prevalence of infections , formulate the effective reproduction number ( i.e. , the number of secondary infections produced by a single infected individual in a finite population  @xcite ) , quantify super - spreaders  @xcite , and detect the source of infections if past contacts and the epidemiological state of the population are known at a given time  @xcite .",

    "each snapshot corresponds to time @xmath9 , representing the temporal resolution of observation of contact networks or the level of coarse graining of contact networks in terms of time .",
    "if the total observation time of a contact network is @xmath10 , the number of snapshots is equal to @xmath11 .",
    "the framework of dynamic networks is relevant if @xmath9 is smaller than or comparable with the time scale of the epidemics process . otherwise , the network changes more slowly than the epidemic states , and the static network approximation is sufficient . in the present paper ,",

    "for example , the true probability that two individuals @xmath18 and @xmath21 are simultaneously infected at time @xmath6 may be larger or smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the iba to the case of weighted networks .",
    "the iba is known for the continuous - time sir model on static networks @xcite .",
    "adapting it to the case of dynamic networks and discretising the time yield a set of equations similar to equations   ( see supplementary information ) .    to calculate the iba in each time step , we start by calculating @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , which requires @xmath36 time . then , we scan the list of contacts at time @xmath6 , by which we can calculate the most time - consuming part , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "this operation requires @xmath37 time , where @xmath38 is the mean number of contacts per individual in a snapshot .",
    "therefore , running the iba for the entire dynamic network data requires @xmath39 time . running a direct numerical simulation of the sir dynamics consumes @xmath36 time for possible recovery events and @xmath37 time for possible infection events for each time step .",
    "therefore , the total time for a single realisation is of the same order as that for the iba .",

    "the estimate by the iba is compared with other approaches available in the literature , i.e. , ( i ) direct numerical simulation on the dynamic network , abbreviated as s - dn , ( ii ) numerical simulation on the static version of the network , s - sn , and ( iii ) the standard well - mixed theory , wmt ( see materials and methods ) . in ( i ) and ( ii ) we take averages over 200 realisations of the simulation but exclude null outbreaks ( i.e. the index individual has infected no other individual in the entire observation interval ) to calculate @xmath50 .",
    "we exclude null outbreaks because approximations using probabilistic flows , including the iba , are generally accurate under the condition that minor outbreaks ( i.e. , realisations of the dynamics causing a small final outbreak size ) are eliminated  @xcite .",

    "the iba captures the effect of variations in the contact patterns within and between multiple days .",
    "for example , we observe a second wave of infections after the first wave has decayed to low levels .",
    "the fact that multiple waves and sudden changes in @xmath50 are observed for simulations averaged over 200 realisations indicates that they are phenomena shared by a majority of realisations yielding non - null outbreaks .",

    "this result is possibly because of generally faster spreading in heterogeneous networks due to well - connected individuals ( i.e. , hubs ) in the early stage of the epidemics  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that heterogeneous temporal information substantially affects the time course of epidemic spreading , which is captured by the iba for temporal networks , but not by methods that disregard temporal information about the contacts .    in a wide region of the @xmath13@xmath14 parameter space , the final outbreak size @xmath57 for the s - dn ( fig .",

    "more importantly , we showed that if longitudinal network data were available , the source of an epidemic could be efficiently detected , assuming a sir dynamics , even if only the current state of the epidemics was known .",
