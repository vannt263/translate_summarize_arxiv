    "the calculations show that while there is a rapid change of the electric condensate across the phase transition temperature , the magnetic condensate changes very little  @xcite , somehow reflecting a possible link to the observed sudden change in the space - time wilson loop and the persistent area - law behavior of the space - space wilson loop across the phase transition  @xcite .    using the temperature dependence of the dimension 4 condensates as the input in the qcd sum rule approach for the heavy quark system , @xmath1 and @xmath2",

    "whose renormalization has been worked out before  @xcite , the renormalization of the two dimension 6 gluon operators are now understood .",
    "unfortunately , a direct lattice calculation is presently not feasible to extract their temperature dependence since the higher dimensional operators will come with large uncertainties and the mixing with lower dimensional operators becomes problematic . at the same time , in the pure gauge theory , it is interesting to note that while the dimension 6 scalar operator is composed of a higher product of gluon field strength tensor , the spin-2 part is the second moment of the dimension 4 scalar gluon condensate , thus suggesting a strong correlation with the dimension 4 operator .",
    "the connections become more apparent when we express the dimension 6 operators in terms of color electric ( @xmath3 ) and magnetic ( @xmath4 ) fields .    in this paper , using these expressions and the temperature dependence of dimension 4 electric and magnetic condensates extracted from lattice gauge theory , we estimate the changes of the dimension 6 operators near the critical temperature @xmath0 .",
