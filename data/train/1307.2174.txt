    "the calculated dose profiles were compared with experimental data where available . in particular , the depth - dose profiles for @xmath6he nuclei in water were studied along with the distributions of positron - emitting nuclei produced by these projectiles  @xcite .    while the capabilities of the geant4 toolkit to model propagation of protons and carbon nuclei in tissue - like media were already demonstrated in several publications ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite , much less attention was paid to simulations with other projectiles , e.g. @xmath1he and @xmath2li .",
    "one may expect that due to a reduced total reaction cross section of these light projectiles , the importance of fragmentation reactions on the corresponding dose distribution will be reduced with respect to @xmath3c . on the other hand",
    "one can note , that while boron or beryllium nuclei are frequently produced by @xmath3c with their @xmath7 close to the projectile nucleus , @xmath1he usually fragments into a proton , a neutron and a deuteron resulting in a rapid drop of @xmath7 .",
    "this indicates that in addition to the known reduction of the total fragmentation cross section with the decrease of the projectile mass , the composition of secondary fragments has also to be taken into account . in turn",

    "the first fast stage of nucleus - nucleus collisions is described by two geant4 models , the light ion binary cascade model ( g4bic )  @xcite for proton , helium and lithium beams , and the quantum molecular dynamics model ( g4qmd )  @xcite for carbon beams . as a result of simulation of a nucleus - nucleus collision some excited nuclear fragments",
    "are produced in addition to free nucleons .",
    "therefore , the g4excitationhandler of geant4 is used to simulate subsequent decays of excited nuclear fragments by applying various de - excitation models depending on the mass and excitation energy of these fragments . the fermi break - up model ( g4fermibreakup )",

    "the rbe for a given kind of mammalian cells irradiated by ions can be estimated using the microdosimetric - kinetic ( mk ) model  @xcite .",
    "the mk model combines a microdosimetric description of energy deposition events in sub - nuclear domains of irradiated cells with a kinetic description of creation and repair of radiation - induced lesions . in this phenomenological model the linear - quadratic relation for the cell survival curve is derived for low - let radiation by assuming a poisson distribution of lethal lesions in the domain volume  @xcite . in the case of high - let particles",

    "equation  ( [ eq : alpha ] ) establishes a relation between @xmath17 and the @xmath40-parameter of the linear - quadratic model irrespective of the specific ion species .",
    "this relation reflects the fact that an excessive local energy deposition is inefficient to boost a given biological effect  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the rbe known as the saturation effect .",
    "according to the modified mk model the rbe for hsg cells can be estimated using the following relation  @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 = 5.0  gy is the 10% survival dose of the reference radiation ( 200  kvp x - rays ) for hsg cells  @xcite .    as shown in  @xcite ,",
    "the microdosimetric parameter @xmath17 is well suited to estimate the @xmath40-parameter for hsg and other cell lines for a large variety of projectiles including proton , helium and carbon nuclei .",

    "the role of nuclear reactions to attenuate the intensity of @xmath0h , @xmath1he , @xmath2li and @xmath3c beam particles while they propagate in water can be well understood from fig .",

    "nuclear reactions are less frequent for @xmath0h and @xmath1he beams , as only @xmath46% of protons and @xmath47% of alphas participate in nuclear reactions before they stop .    in the experiments of tsuda et al .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0h and @xmath1he projectiles entered the tepc after traversing 150170  mm of water when their energies were reduced to 1738 mev per nucleon . as seen from fig .",

    "the contributions of secondary fragments to microdosimetry spectra obtained with @xmath2li and @xmath3c  @xcite are expected to be much larger as compared with @xmath0h and @xmath1he beams . indeed , as can be estimated from fig .",

    "the lets of protons and ions vary significantly in the range of the kinetic energies used for radiation therapy .",
    "the lineal energy @xmath49 , which is measured by tepc , serves as an estimation of let and its frequency distribution includes contributions from various particles traversing the detector .",

    "once the validity of monte carlo modelling is confirmed by a good agreement of calculated and measured spectrum , the contributions from specific particles can be reliably identified .",
    "the study of microdosimetry spectra collected far from the beam helps to evaluate the accuracy of nuclear fragmentation models since such spectra are built entirely by secondary fragments .",
    "at the same time , the monte carlo modelling of microdosimetry spectra opens the possibility to understand the quality of radiation in mixed radiation fields .      the simulated microdosimetry spectrum for a proton beam traversing a @xmath50  mm range shifter made of water is shown in fig .",

    "one can clearly see that the model systematically underestimates events with very low lineal energy ( @xmath52  kev/@xmath20 m ) in all simulations with the wall - less tepc . in order to investigate whether this is related to the limitation for production of @xmath28-electrons with g4emstd and g4empen , we carried out a simulation with g4dna with results presented in fig .",

    "[ fig : spectra_h_20 ] , g4empen and g4dna provide statistically equivalent results even though the simulation with g4empen accounts for a detailed geometric description of the detector , while g4dna works only with an equivalent cylindrical water volume .",
    "since there are no low - energy limits for production of @xmath28-electrons in simulations with g4dna , one should conclude that the deficit of events with very low @xmath49 is not related to limitations of electron transport .    as seen from fig .",

    "there are no noticeable changes in the peak position of hydrogen fragments .",

    "also target fragments may eventually contribute with large @xmath49 events as can be seen at `` 10  cm , tail '' but one should keep in mind the poor statistic for such events for tepc positions at 10  cm away from beam axis .",
    "the general shapes of calculated microdosimetry spectra are found to be similar to the shapes of measured spectra .",
    "however , the spectra at the tail , 2 and 10  cm away from the beam axis are underestimated by mchit . since at all these positions ( excluding `` 2  cm , peak '' ) the spectra are mostly formed by hydrogen - like fragments , this indicates that the yields of proton , deuterons and tritons may be underestimated by the light ion binary cascade model used to simulate fragmentation of @xmath2li projectiles . for the tepc position `` 2  cm , peak '' this deficiency",
    "may also be connected to some underestimation of the yield of helium fragments , as the cascade model neglects the cluster structure of @xmath2li and treats all intra - nuclear nucleons as uncorrelated .",

    "a shoulder in the spectrum at low @xmath49 at `` 0  cm , plateau '' position is due to the contribution of several projectile fragments .",
    "similar to @xmath2li beam , the events with y@xmath66100  kev/@xmath20 m are due to protons and alphas emitted by target nuclei .",
    "since these target fragments are much slower than the projectile fragments , they provide higher @xmath49 values at this tepc position with respect to a sharp peak due to primary @xmath3c nuclei . apart from the underestimation of events with 40@xmath67100  kev/@xmath20 m , the spectrum measured at the entry to the water phantom on the beam axis is well reproduced by mchit .",
    "the peak of primary @xmath3c nuclei also dominates at the tepc position `` 0  cm ,  peak '' on the beam axis close to the bragg peak .",
    "there , the agreement with the measured spectrum is in general good with the exception of a slight underestimation of the contribution of projectile fragments seen at lower @xmath49 before the main peak .",

    "circles represent experimental data  @xcite . ]    the spectra at `` 0  cm ,  tail '' , `` 2  cm ,  peak '' and `` 2  cm ,  tail '' are built from overlapping contributions from various projectile fragments : h , he , li and be . among these three positions a noticeable contribution from boron nuclei is predicted only at `` 2  cm ,  peak '' . as follows from the calculations , the maxima of the contributions from h , he , li , be and b are ordered according to @xmath7 of the corresponding nuclei : more heavy fragments contribute with larger @xmath49 .",
    "the contributions from he nuclei are remarkable .",
    "the spectra at these three positions are also underestimated , as in the case of @xmath2li beam .",
    "the quantitative agreement between calculations and measurements for @xmath3c beam is much better compared to @xmath2li beam , but still the deviations of the calculated spectra from measured ones can be attributed to the underestimation of he fragments .",
    "the other four spectra , namely , at `` 2  cm ,  plateau '' , `` 10  cm ,  plateau '' , `` 10  cm ,  peak '' and `` 10  cm ,  tail '' are mostly composed from the contributions of hydrogen nuclei produced in fragmentation of @xmath3c .",
    "they are also slightly underestimated by mchit .",
    "some traces of the contributions from fragments of the target nuclei are also seen at these four positions far from the @xmath3c beam .",
    "such target fragments are scarcely produced in nuclear reactions induced by energetic secondary protons and neutrons .      using the calculated microdosimetry spectra we may now estimate the biological effectiveness of @xmath0h , @xmath1he , @xmath2li and @xmath3c nuclei . for the sake of comparison we have chosen their beam energies such that they lead to similar ranges in water .",

    "experimental rbe@xmath43 for carbon beam estimated from experimental data  @xcite are plotted in the same figure for comparison .",
    "the well - known increase of the rbe for carbon ions on their way from the plateau region to the bragg peak seen in the experimental data is well reproduced by mchit+mk model .",
    "helium and lithium ions also show favourable rbe profiles characterized by even lower values at the plateau region , with much steeper increase close to the bragg peak and lower rbe values in the tail .",
    "the maximum rbe@xmath43 values for helium , lithium and carbon ions found around the bragg peak are 2.2 , 2.5 and 2.9 , respectively . at the plateau region",
    "the values are 1.0 , 1.0 and 1.2 , respectively . for protons ,",
    "the model predicts the rbe@xmath43 value slightly below 1 at the entrance to the phantom and a smooth increase to 1.2 at the bragg peak . a further increase of rbe@xmath43 after the peak may be related to slow secondary neutrons produced in nuclear reactions .",
    "similar calculations were performed with the tepc placed 2 cm away from the beam axis at the depth of the bragg peak . at this point rbe@xmath43 of 1.1@xmath680.1",
    "was estimated from calculated microdosimetry spectra for all four ions .",

    "the biological dose values at the tail of the lithium and carbon beams are found to be very similar , while the helium beam delivers a smaller dose to the tail region due to a reduced fragmentation rate .",
    "these results show that helium and lithium beams are also promising options in addition to a well - established carbon - ion cancer therapy .     calculated correlation between rbe@xmath43 and @xmath12 for @xmath0h , @xmath1he , @xmath2li and @xmath3c beams in water .",

    "fig : rbe ] look similar in shape , the relation between @xmath12 representing let and rbe@xmath43 is not trivial .",
    "the correlated pairs of values @xmath12 and rbe@xmath43 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbe_yf ] for all four considered beams .",
    "the curves demonstrate a monotonic increase of rbe@xmath43 with the rise of @xmath12 before the bragg peak .",
    "the correlations for @xmath1he and @xmath2li are similar to each other , but they differ from the case of @xmath3c . in the case of the carbon beam ,",
    "the increase is more pronounced but rbe@xmath43 reaches a maximum at the bragg peak and then slightly drops for increasing @xmath12 values .",
    "this behaviour shows a kind of saturation effect .",
    "such effect is not observed for @xmath1he and @xmath2li .",
    "particularly , one can see that for these two ions rbe@xmath43 continues to rise even when @xmath12 values start decreasing in the tail region .",
    "another feature of the relation between @xmath12 and rbe@xmath43 is that for a given beam similar @xmath12 values correspond to quite different rbe@xmath43 at the plateau and tail of the depth - dose distribution .",
    "primary beam particles and secondary fragments which dominate , respectively , in these two regions provide rather similar @xmath12 , but their rbe@xmath43 differ significantly .",
    "these results confirm that @xmath12 ( let ) solely is not sufficient to characterize the biological effects of various beams .",
    "our analysis of the microdosimetry spectra for light nuclei lead us to the following conclusions :    * the microdosimetry spectra of protons calculated for the macroscopic - size tepc filled with dilute gas agree well with the microdosimetry spectra calculated for the equivalent microscopic volume of water with g4dna physics list . in this way",
    "the basic assumption of the microdosimetry technique is fully validated by monte carlo simulations with mchit .",
    "* contributions of primary beam nuclei and secondary fragments to the microdosimetry spectra can be realistically evaluated by monte carlo simulations with mchit . *",
    "a proper modelling of nuclear fragmentation reactions is crucial for describing microdosimetry spectra both on the beam axis and far from the beam .",
    "further improvements of nuclear fragmentation models , e.g. with respect to production of @xmath1he nuclei , could improve the description of the microdosimetry data and , therefore , provide a better understanding of the radiation effects from the considered therapeutic beams .",
    "* the mchit model is able to describe reasonably well the microdosimetry spectra for hydrogen and helium beams in water .",
    "microdosimetry spectra for lithium beams are well described on the beam axis from the entrance down to the bragg peak while the spectra are underestimated far from the primary beam .",
    "it was demonstrated that in the case of tepc directly irradiated by a @xmath2li beam , the agreement with the experimental data can be significantly improved by taking into account the pile - up effect .",
    "this is specific to the experimental data of  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that similar measurements , but with lower beam current , will be not distorted by overlapping events .",
    "the spectra for carbon beam are generally well described , despite of some underestimations at positions far from the beam axis and also in the tail region . *",
    "mchit coupled with the modified mk model allowed us to estimate the rbe for proton , helium , lithium and carbon ions at several positions in a water phantom .",
