    "<S> short - pulse effects are investigated for the nonlinear breit - wheeler process , i.e. the production of an electron - positron pair induced by a gamma photon inside an intense plane - wave laser pulse . to obtain the total pair - creation probability we verify ( to leading - order ) the cutting rule for the polarization operator in the realm of strong - field qed by an explicit calculation . using a double - integral representation for the leading - order contribution to the polarization operator , </S>",
    "<S> compact expressions for the total pair - creation probability inside an arbitrary plane - wave background field are derived . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the photon wave function including leading - order radiative corrections in the laser field is obtained via the schwinger - dyson equation in the quasistatic approximation . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) and of the laser pulse shape on the total pair - creation probability in a linearly polarized laser pulse is investigated , and the validity of the ( local ) constant - crossed field approximation analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that with presently available technology pair - creation probabilities of the order of ten percent could be reached for a single gamma photon . </S>"
