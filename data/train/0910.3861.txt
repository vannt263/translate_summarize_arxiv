    "in the following we use the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) form of bell inequality @xcite , which is the most suitable for an experimental test of nonlocality in bipartite quantum systems composed by spin-@xmath0 objects . let the operator @xmath7 be a spin observable with eigenvalues @xmath8 associated to the spin @xmath9 defined by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the unit vector indicating an arbitrary direction in the spin space and @xmath12 is the pauli matrices vector .",
    "the chsh - bell inequality associated to a two - spin-@xmath0 state @xmath13 is then @xmath14 @xcite , where @xmath15 is the bell function defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the correlation function of observables",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . if , given the state @xmath13 , it is possible to find a set of angles @xmath21 and @xmath22 such that the chsh - bell inequality is violated ( @xmath23 ) the correlations are nonlocal and can not be reproduced by any classical local model .    a necessary and sufficient condition for violating the chsh - bell inequality by an arbitrary two - spin-@xmath0 mixed state is known @xcite",
    ". once introduced the @xmath24 real matrix @xmath25 , defined by the matrix elements @xmath26 , where the @xmath27 s are the pauli matrices , one must build the matrix @xmath28 , a symmetric matrix which can be therefore diagonalized ( @xmath29 indicates the transposed matrix of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the maximum of the bell function @xmath15 results then to be given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 s are the three eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath33 . a procedure to obtain the angles giving the maximum value of the bell function",
    "is also provided @xcite .",
    "in this section we give the maximum value of the bell function for the class of states whose density matrix @xmath34 , in the standard computational basis @xmath35 , has a x structure of the kind @xmath36 this class of states is sufficiently general to include the two - qubit states most considered both theoretically and experimentally , like bell states ( pure two - qubit maximally entangled states ) and werner states ( mixture of bell states with white noise ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , a x structure density matrix arises in a wide variety of physical situations @xcite .",
    "a further remarkable aspect of the x states is that , under various kinds of dynamics , the initial x structure is maintained during the evolution @xcite .",
    "using the criterion previously described to obtain @xmath37 , the three eigenvalues @xmath38 s , in terms of the density matrix elements , are found to be @xmath39 as also already reported @xcite .",
    "being @xmath40 always larger than @xmath41 , the maximum of bell function for x states results to be @xmath42",
    "here we give the obps , that is the angles @xmath43 s and @xmath44 s maximizing the bell function @xmath15 of eq .",
    ", for the x states class of eq .  . following a known procedure @xcite we find the explicit obps , which result in two different sets of angles in correspondence of the two regions @xmath45 ( region 1 ) and @xmath46 ( region 2 )",
    "* set 1 : @xmath45 . * the obps in this case",
    "are given by @xmath47/2,\\quad\\phi'_1=0,\\nonumber\\\\ \\phi_2&=&\\phi'_2=\\left[\\arg(\\rho_{23})-\\arg(\\rho_{14})\\right]/2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the the function @xmath48 is @xmath49 if @xmath50 and @xmath51 if @xmath52 .",

    "this means that , when this condition is satisfied , two different obps and so experimental settings do give the same value of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , considering the obps as function of the quantum state , to a slight continuous change of the quantum state crossing the point @xmath54 , it corresponds an unexpected finite `` jump '' of the suitable experimental settings .",
    "it is worth to emphasize the importance to have an analytical result for the two - qubit configuration here considered .",
    "in fact , if an analytical criterion to find obps was absent , numerical procedures would be necessary .",
    "this is the case , for example , in systems of more than two qubits where mermin inequalities are considered to test nonlocality @xcite . on the basis on the two - qubit result , one may expect that a finite jump of the obps take place even for the multiqubit configuration . however , if this jump was present , starting from one of the obps sets , numerical procedures could give rise to serious problems in identifying the point of this possible obps jump because of the finite distance between the two sets of parameters .",
    "it is clear that the angles of eqs .   and , which determine",
    "the orientations of the measurement apparatus in real space giving @xmath3 for two spin-@xmath0 objects , do correspond to different experimental settings for a general two - qubit system . in cavity",
    "qed , for example , qubits are represented by either two - level rydberg atoms or cavities having one or zero photons ; ramsey zones followed by field ionization detectors are then the devices suitable for measuring the qubit along an arbitrary pseudospin direction , whose angles @xmath55 are controlled by the classical microwave field amplitude and the atom - field interaction time inside the ramsey zone @xcite . in the context of traveling polarized photons , where the chsh - bell inequality was originally applied @xcite ,",
    "the spin levels are usually coded in the horizontal ( @xmath56 ) and vertical ( @xmath57 ) polarizations of the photon , the angles @xmath44 s are usually set at zero and the angles @xmath43 s are related to the angles @xmath58 s of photon polarizers by @xmath59 @xcite ; the measurement is finally performed by photodetectors . in solid - state physics with josephson phase qubits , coded by the two first levels of a well potential ,",
    "pseudospin directions are selected by rotating the qubit states using microwave pulses before performing measurements by a pulse of current along the @xmath60 axis of the bloch sphere ( basis states of the qubit ) @xcite .",
    "so far we have found the optimized parameters ( obps ) that give the best condition for the bell test on a given two - qubit x state . from an experimental point of view ,",
    "one firstly needs to know the density matrix of the state on which to measure @xmath3 and confirm if there is a violation of the chsh - bell inequality .",
    "this can be done by quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "therefore , in presence of a time - evolving quantum state , one may establish the form of the state with its density matrix elements at the time of the measurement .",
    "the experimental settings of the devices for the bell test can be then appropriately adjusted according to our indications . in this section",
    "we give a dynamical example where the obps not only are crucial to reveal nonlocality , but they also present an unexpected behavior .    consider a system of two identical independent qubits , namely 1 and 2 , each embedded in a zero - temperature bosonic environment .",
    "each qubit has ground and excited states @xmath61 , @xmath62 separated by a transition frequency @xmath63 . for our study",
    "we need the two - qubit reduced density matrix at the time @xmath5 .",
    "this can be accomplished by exploiting a procedure based on the knowledge of the single - qubit dynamics @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the single part `` qubit - environment '' is described , in the case of bosonic reservoir under rotating wave and dipole approximations , by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath64,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the qubit raising and lowering operators , @xmath67 , @xmath68 are the photon creation and annihilation operators and @xmath69 is the coupling constant of the mode @xmath70 with frequency @xmath71 . it is found that , for a zero - temperature environment , the single - qubit evolution under the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be described in terms of a single function @xmath72 , whose square modulus @xmath73 can be linked to the single - qubit excited state population . in the basis @xmath74 , the single - qubit reduced density matrix @xmath75 can be then written as @xcite @xmath76 the fact that the density matrix @xmath75 can be expressed in terms of a single function @xmath72 is general , the information on the environment spectral density and coupling constants being contained in the explicit time dependence of the function @xmath72 itself .",
    "the two - qubit density matrix @xmath77 is then obtained @xcite , its elements depending only on their initial values and on the function @xmath72 , regardless of the environment structure .",
    "hereafter , for the sake of simplicity , we shall indicate @xmath78 .",
    "we choose as two - qubit initial state the extended werner - like state defined as @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the purity parameter , @xmath81 the @xmath82 identity matrix and @xmath83 is the one - excitation bell - like state with @xmath84 positive real and @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 reduces to a werner state for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , that is when its pure part becomes a bell state . for @xmath89",
    "the state above becomes a totally mixed state , while for @xmath90 it reduces to the bell - like ( pure ) state @xmath91 .",
    "this state has an x form which is maintained during the dynamics due to the spin - boson hamiltonian of eq .  .",
    "we can analyze the dependence of the dynamics of @xmath3 on the initial mixedness and degree of entanglement .",
    "starting from the two - qubit state defined above , the expressions of @xmath40 , @xmath92 and @xmath41 of eq .",

    "moreover , for values @xmath120 , using the parameters of set 1 ( giving the maximal violation when @xmath121 ) one finds no violation of bell inequality while using those of set 2 one finds a violation .",

    "we have found that this class of states can be divided in two parts each of them corresponding to a different set of obps .",
    "we have also found that even if the state of the system changes continuously , as when it evolves with time , a surprising abrupt jump of these obps may occur in proximity of some states . in particular , we have shown that these jumps of the experimental settings that maximize the bell function occur during the evolution of a paradigmatic two - qubit open system .",
