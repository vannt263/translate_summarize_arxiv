    "two of the main pillars of mathematical finance are modern portfolio theory ( mpt ) and the capital asset pricing model(capm ) .",
    "the seminal work on mpt is attributed to markowitz who presented his mean - variance approach to asset allocation in 1952@xcite .",
    "it was soon amplified by sharpe in 1964@xcite and by lintner in 1965@xcite with the introduction of the concept of the capital market line and subsequent development of the capm .",
    "mpt permeates the teaching and practice of classical financial theory .",
    "substantial portions of most textbooks on finance are devoted to it and its implications .",
    "its influence has been profound .",
    "the notion that portfolio volatility , the square root of the variance of the portfolio yield , is an adequate proxy for risk is fundamental to mpt .",
    "similarly , the notion that there exists at least one risk - free asset is fundamental to the construction of the capital market line and the formulation of the capm . in the present paper , we discuss issues surrounding both of these notions and , abandoning them , introduce a novel method of portfolio optimization .",
    "the notion that variance measures risk is now viewed as a weak compromise with economic reality .",
    "variance measures uncertainty , and there are circumstances of interest in which great uncertainty implies little risk .",
    "similarly , supposing that there are risk - free assets or , more precisely , assets with unvarying yield is a poor approximation , particularly for long - time horizons .",
    "there have been attempts to develop mpt with alternative definitions of risk , including a semi - variance , rms loss , average downside risk , value at risk ( var ) and others@xcite but to our knowledge , none is based on the classic notion that the probability of failure to meet a preset goal is the proper quantitative measure of risk or on the elimination of the notion of a risk - free asset .    in the following sections we give a brief introduction of mpt with critiques of each of the above two fundamental notions .",
    "we show that the probability of success can be interpreted as an expected utility that is deficient in some desirable features .",
    "we construct an additional utility with the desired properties and include it in the portfolio optimization .",
    "we discuss how to define a real portfolio optimization problem using historical data and report the result of our risk and utility evaluation using the daily closing prices for 13,000 stocks listed on the nyse and nasdaq during the period 1977 - 1996 .",
    "we conclude by presenting the results of our optimization for a portfolio drawn from a subset of low - risk , high utility stocks and discuss the implications of our main findings .",
    "the asset allocation problem is one of the fundamental concerns of financial theory . it can be phrased as a question : what is the optimal allocation of funds @xmath0 among a set of assets @xmath1 for a predetermined level of risk ? phrased in this way it leaves unspecified the meaning of optimality and of risk .",
    "modern portfolio theory offers a two step answer via a particular specification of optimality and risk .",
    "the first step was taken in 1952 with the introduction of the mean - variance approach of markowitz@xcite . by equating risk with variance",
    ", markowitz derived an efficient frontier of portfolios which maximize return for given risk and opened the door to further advances in this theoretical framework .",
    "the addition of a risk - free asset by sharpe@xcite and lintner@xcite in the mid 1960s led to the capital market line and the capm .",
    "they supposed that there exists a risk - free asset @xmath2 , whose yield , @xmath3 , did not fluctuate .",
    "the line drawn from @xmath3 tangent to the efficient frontier is then the locus of yields of all optimal portfolios which can be constructed by adding the risk - free asset to holdings drawn from the tangent set which via equilibrium arguments is indentified with the market portfolio . along that line ,",
    "termed the capital market line , return increases linearly with risk@xcite .",
    "the one - fund theorem follows , stating that any portfolio on the capital market line may be constructed from a combination of the risk - free asset and the market portfolio@xcite .",
    "we have two fundamental objections to mpt .",
    "first , volatility measures the uncertainty of yield .",
    "while it may be positively correlated with risk in some cases , it does not , in general , measure risk .",
    "suppose , for example , that the specific goal for the portfolio is that its mean yield @xmath4 must equal or exceed a minimum acceptable value @xmath5 .",
    "suppose also that the volatility of the portfolio is large , perhaps significantly larger than @xmath5 . nevertheless , if the mean yield is also large , enough so that @xmath6 significantly exceeds the volatility , @xmath7 , the probability that the goal is not met will be small .",
    "there can be large uncertainty with little risk .",
    "second , no asset is risk - free in the long term , and , depending on risk tolerance , perhaps not even in the short term .",
    "there are various risks associated with any supposedly risk - free asset , including e.g. , inflation risk , interest - rate risk , and exchange - rate risk .",
    "we conclude that @xmath2 , the candidate risk - free asset , should be added to the asset mix and optimized with the rest .",
    "the results of this addition are far reaching .",
    "the efficient frontier is modified , the capital market line disappears , and the one - fund theorem is in general not valid .",
    "the efficient market portfolio is no longer unique .",
    "for more than four centuries , the _ probability of failure has been taken as the quantitative measure of risk@xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 be the probability of success .",
    "then the risk is @xmath9 and the adverse odds @xmath10 .",
    "however , to define success there must be a goal .",
    "we take as the goal of asset allocation the one previously introduced , namely that the expected portfolio yield equal or exceed @xmath5 , a minimum acceptable yield .",
    "_    the average yields and volatilities of the individual assets depend on @xmath11 , the investment horizon ( holding period ) as of course does the entire probability distribution of @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of @xmath13 and the volatility , @xmath14 , on @xmath11 for 13,000 stocks using price - time data from 1977 - 1996 .",
    "we found a non - universal power law dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath11 , @xmath15 we conclude that specifying @xmath11 is an essential part of defining the goal .",
    "the minimum acceptable , yield @xmath5 , has two components , which must be specified independently , @xmath16 where , @xmath17 is the minimum acceptable real ( deflated ) after - tax yield .",
    "@xmath18 is an allowance for transaction costs , inflation , and tax costs .      in mpt",
    ", selecting a value for the volatility , @xmath7 , of the optimal portfolio establishes uncertainty tolerance .",
    "instead , we specify a minimum acceptable value of @xmath8 , @xmath19 . stating that @xmath8 must equal or exceed @xmath19 , establishes our risk tolerance . with @xmath1 , @xmath5 , and @xmath11 chosen and with knowledge of @xmath20 $ ] the joint probability distribution of the @xmath12 , @xmath8 can be evaluated for each allocation vector , @xmath21 , @xmath22.\\ ] ]",
    "optimization then consists of finding the supremum of @xmath4 for @xmath23 subject to @xmath24 .",
    "the definition of @xmath8 given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath25 that is as the expectation value of the heaviside unit function , @xmath26 in this form , it can be interpreted as an expected _ utility with @xmath27 the _ utility function .",
    "@xmath27 punishes all losses equally and thus lacks the ability to discriminate .",
    "thus @xmath8 has shortcomings when viewed as a utility . _",
    "_      the criterion @xmath23 should be kept as the specification of risk tolerance .",
    "to overcome the objections to @xmath8 as a utility , we add to our optimization constraints a supplementary utility tolerance which must be met as well .",
    "we define @xmath28 as the expectation of the following utility function , @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn6 ] ) , @xmath18 , introduced in section 4.1 , is a natural choice for _ utility sensitivity .",
    "in contrast to the heaviside function , this function , while not unique , has the required utility characteristics .",
    "it penalizes failure to meet the goal by going negative and rapidly increasing in magnitude with decreasing yield below @xmath5 .",
    "it has positive and diminishing marginal utility as well . _",
    "for short enough horizons , @xmath11 , the random yield , @xmath30 , of a portfolio specified by @xmath21 is still linearly related to @xmath31 , as in section 4.2 .",
    "suppose now , that the @xmath12 are correlated gaussian random variables .",
    "given its linearity in the @xmath12 , @xmath30 is then normally distributed with probability distribution @xmath32      the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) of @xmath8 now becomes @xmath33 introducing @xmath34 , a modified sharpe s ratio@xcite , @xmath35 allows us to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eqn9 ] ) as @xmath36 the minimum acceptable value @xmath19 of @xmath8 thus defines through eq .",
    "( [ eqn11 ] ) a minimum acceptable value of @xmath34 , @xmath37 .",
    "for example , if @xmath38 then @xmath39 .",
    "specifying that @xmath40 introduces a linear risk boundary @xmath41 in the @xmath42 plane , as shown in fig .",
    "portfolios having acceptable risk , @xmath23 , lie above the boundary .",
    "those with unacceptable risk , @xmath43 , lie below it .      from eq .",
    "( [ eqn6 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqn8 ] ) the expected utility , @xmath28 , is simply @xmath44 where the _ utility ratio @xmath45 is @xmath46 a minimum acceptable value @xmath47 of @xmath28 implies a minimum acceptable value @xmath48 of @xmath45 . for example , @xmath49 implies @xmath50 . specifying @xmath47 defines the utility boundary @xmath51 in the @xmath42 plane , also shown in fig .",
    "1 . above the boundary , portfolios have @xmath52 and are acceptable .",
    "below , they have @xmath53 and are unacceptable . _",
    "a portfolio is fully acceptable if it meets both the risk and utility criteria , that is if @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath48 for a given @xmath37 , the resulting acceptability boundary in the @xmath42 plane can coincide with the utility boundary or can have one risk boundary and one or two utility boundary segments as illustrated in fig .",
    "the aceptability boundary is always effectively convex .",
    "portfolio optimization can now proceed by finding @xmath56 the acceptability boundary is convex , and the efficient frontier is concave . consequently , there are zero , one , or two intersections as illustrated in fig .",
    "if there are no intersections because the acceptability boundary lies above the efficient frontier , no portfolio can be constructed which meets the investment criteria .",
    "if there are two intersections , the upper intersection specifies the optimal portfolio . because of the convex / concave characteristics of the boundaries and the monotonic upward shift of the acceptability boundary with increasing @xmath8 and @xmath28 , this optimal portfolio has maximum allowable risk and minimum allowable utility .",
    "one intersection is the marginal case .",
    "the optimal portfolio is indicated by a solid square at the intersection of the acceptability boundary and the efficient frontier.,title=\"fig:\",width=566 ] [ figure1 ]",
    "we choose @xmath17 to be 6% and @xmath18 to be 5% so that @xmath5 is 11% .",
    "we explore holding periods between 1 and 5 years and set a conservative value of @xmath19=0.9 and an aggressive value of @xmath47=0 .",
    "we do not allow short positions , @xmath58 .",
    "we select stocks as the candidate assets .",
    "our historical data source is the daily closing prices of 13,000 nyse and nsadaq stocks during the 20 year period 1977 - 1996 obtained from genesis financial services .",
    "the risk and utility criteria divide the @xmath57 plane into four sectors :    1 .",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath53-unacceptable @xmath8 and @xmath28 values .",
    "2 .   @xmath43 , @xmath52-unacceptable @xmath8 and acceptable @xmath28 values .",

    "typical scatter - plot results are shown in table i for @xmath38 and @xmath49 .",
    "the entries in each sector column give the number of stocks from among those in the entire universe of 13,000 .",
    "@xmath59 is the time span of the working data .",
    "the proportion of stocks which individually meet the @xmath19 and @xmath47 criteria is small . the total population of sectors b and d , where @xmath52 is substantially larger than that of sectors c and d where , @xmath23 , illustrating the more aggressive character of the utility criterion .",
    ".sector populations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "optimizing @xmath8 instead of @xmath4 as an alternative to section 6.4 , we now construct an illustrative example of portfolio optimization .",
    "the investment criteria we use are @xmath5=11% , @xmath60=5% , @xmath61 years , @xmath59=10 years , @xmath19=0.9 , @xmath49 , @xmath58 , and @xmath1 comprises a set of 20 stocks drawn from the 129 stocks in sector d , all of which have @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    ". only 6 of the 20 stocks have nonzero allocation ratios : @xmath73=0.35 , @xmath74=0.043 , @xmath75=0.043 , @xmath76=0.185 , @xmath77=0.336 , and @xmath78=0.043 .",
    "we started with a brief summary of mpt to introduce the concepts of the efficient frontier , the capital market line , and the market portfolio .",
    "we then argued that the concept of a risk - free return is invalid for longer holding periods . to replace the volatility , which measures uncertainty not risk , we introduced the probability of failure to meet a preset investment goal as a measure of risk .",
    "the corresponding probability of success , @xmath8 , is a utility which neither penalizes failure nor incorporates diminishing positive marginal utility .",
    "we supplement @xmath8 with an appropriately defined utility @xmath28 and impose minimum acceptable values of @xmath8 and @xmath28 for the portfolio . to explore the feasibility of implementing @xmath57 based portfolio optimization , we computed the @xmath79 and @xmath80 values for individual stocks over various holding periods using historical data drawn from a database of 13,000 stocks .",
    "composing the asset set of 20 stocks from the acceptable sector of the @xmath57 plane , we optimized the probability of success for a lower bound to the expected yield .",
    "the results imply the feasibility of constructing a convex @xmath81 efficient frontier in the @xmath81 plane . the optimal portfolio can be that which maximizes @xmath4 on the frontier subject to @xmath23 and @xmath52 or simply that which maximizes @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath80 , @xmath79 scatter plot is a powerful tool for candidate asset selection .",
    "all of this is an academic exercise unless it is accompanied by a measure of confidence that the use of historical data generates predictive power .",
