    "decoherence is a process of losing quantum superpositions due to entanglement between the system and its environment @xcite .",
    "studies of the decoherence are pivotal to understanding the emergence of the classical world from an underlying quantum substrate @xcite .",
    "this is because if decoherence did not suppress quantum superpositions in macroscopic systems , then one would end with situations such as the schrdinger s cat @xcite which are not observed in practice . by now",
    ", superpositions and decoherence of microscopic systems have been observed in several experiments such as cavity qed @xcite and trapped ions @xcite .",
    "however in view of the fundamental implications for the quantum to classical transition , it is necessary to gradually extend such experimentation to superpositions in macroscopic systems , perhaps tackling mesoscopic systems at first . in this context ,",
    "several years ago , leggett and co - workers proposed the possibility of observing superpositions of macroscopically distinct flux states in superconducting systems @xcite , an idea which has only recently been experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "another class of experiments , clearly probing quantum superpositions and their decoherence in the mesoscopic domain , is the diffraction of large molecules @xcite . in order to move to mesoscopic systems with slightly larger masses and investigating their decoherence ,",
    "there exist a number of proposals for using nano - scale movable mirrors coupled to quantized light in cavities @xcite , or coupled to a cooper pair box @xcite or to photons in an interferometer @xcite .",
    "the above three schemes @xcite rely on the common idea of coupling a microscopic ( coherent ) system to a mesoscopic or macroscopic ( decoherent ) system to probe the decoherence of the latter . in this paper",
    ", we formulate a scheme based on the same general principle for a completely different mesoscopic system , namely a bose - einstein condensate . while in the earlier work involving nano - scale mirrors",
    "it is a superposition of spatially separated coherent states whose decoherence is studied , in the current paper it is the decoherence of a superposition of coherent states with different phases ( or relative phases in the case of two mode condensates ) which will be studied .",
    "( color online ) a single two - level atom is coupled to a bose - einstein condensate via coherent collisions .",
    "the single atom is trapped in a state - dependent potential such that the upper state @xmath0 interacts with the trapped condensate merely .",
    ", height=151 ]    recently , a general scheme has been proposed @xcite to probe the decoherence of a mesoscopic harmonic oscillator with a qubit whose state couples to the position of the oscillator .",
    "it provides a simultaneous method to generate superpositions and probe the decoherence of a mesoscopic system .",
    "the basic assumption in this scheme is just to maintain the coherence of the qubit during the whole period of the experiment , while the oscillator is allowed to decohere ( it is this decoherence that the scheme aims to detect ) . when a qubit and the oscillator start in appropriate states , they become entangled and a superposition in their joint system is created .",
    "the special form of the coupling entails that after a certain period of time evolution the qubit naturally disentangles from the oscillator and the oscillator is brought back to its original state .",
    "the evidence of the decoherence of the oscillator is then imprinted on the partial coherence of the qubit .",
    "this enables us to determine the decoherence rate of the mesoscopic oscillator by measuring the qubit s state .",
    "perhaps the strongest positive feature of this type of scheme is the fact that the mesoscopic oscillator will not have to be cooled to a pure or nearly pure state in order for the scheme to be successful in probing its decoherence @xcite , in fact it can be in a thermal state at arbitrary temperature .",
    "this happens because of the special nature of the qubit - oscillator coupling and the fact that the mesoscopic system is never directly probed .",
    "naturally an important question is whether such a scheme can be formulated for other kinds of qubits ( the qubits used earlier have been photon number / path @xcite or superconducting @xcite ) such as atomic hyperfine levels which are more coherent , or oscillators which are more coherent than nano - scale mirrors but at the same time still mesoscopic is some sense",
    ". more fundamentally , would such a scheme work , particularly would it still be applicable to thermal states of the oscillator if the qubit was coupled to a different variable of the oscillator instead of its position ?",
    "the system studied in this paper shows that the answer to both the above questions is affirmative .",
    "atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec s ) are mesoscopic systems with a low dissipation rate .",
    "they are promising candidates for observing decoherence .",
    "in fact , experimental studies have rapidly developed since the bose - einstein condensation of atomic gases was observed in a magnetic trap in 1995 @xcite . for example , the quantum phase transition from a superfluid phase to a mott insulator phase has been observed using atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the trapping of multicomponent bec s of @xmath1rb @xcite have been realized .",
    "the control of scattering lengths using feshbach resonances have also been reported @xcite .",
    "these demonstrate the sophisticated techniques available to manipulate ultracold atoms precisely .",
    "notably , schemes for deterministic single atom preparation in the ground state in a trap potential have been proposed @xcite .",
    "a single - atom preparation and its detection is expected to be realized in the near future @xcite .",
    "this paves the way for studying the dynamics of a single atom coupled to a superfluid bec @xcite .",
    "in particular , schemes for cooling a single atom @xcite and probing the phase fluctuations of bec @xcite have been suggested with precisely such an atom - bec coupled system . in this paper , we will present a foundational application of such a system in probing the decoherence of a bec .",
    "naturally , because of the low dissipation rates of becs , there have been quite a few proposals for preparing them directly in non - classical states such as schrdinger cat states @xcite even without an additional system such as a single atom .",
    "if realized , these proposals will also enable one to detect the decoherence that such states of a bec experience .",
    "however , the non - classical states of these papers , being superpositions of states differing by large atom numbers in a given mode , are highly decoherent and their preparation is extremely hard ( may even require one to engineer the environment @xcite and may be destroyed even due to scattering a single photon @xcite ) .",
    "moreover to prepare such states one needs to have a bec in its ground state and thus whether the detection of decoherence will work for a thermal state is unclear .",
    "most importantly , it is a superposition involving the most  classical - like \" states of a harmonic oscillator , namely its coherent states , whose decoherence is the most relevant for studying the transition from the quantum world to the classical world ( as among all the available quantum states of a harmonic oscillator , the coherent states are the closest to classical states because they have equal and minimum uncertainty in all variables ) .",
    "the scheme of this paper is more ideally placed to detecting decoherence of superpositions involving distinct coherent states as opposed to the schrdinger cat states of mode occupation number @xcite .    in this paper , we study a two - level atom coupled to an atomic bec via coherent collisions .",
    "a trapped bec behaves like a harmonic oscillator @xcite such that we can attempt to formulate a scheme similar to refs.@xcite to probe the decoherence of a bec with a single atom . in this way",
    ", the aim is to test the decoherence of superpositions of a mesoscopic oscillator .",
    "the heuristic formula for the decoherce rate of a superposition of two coherent states is given by @xmath2 @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the characteristic damping constant , @xmath5 is the separation of two coherence states in phase space , @xmath6^{-1}$ ] , @xmath7 is the frequency of the oscillator , @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath9 is the temperature .",
    "we will show that our scheme can be applied to detect the decoherence rate of an initial coherent state and even a thermal mixed state .",
    "finite temperature effects on the decoherence of a bec can thus be studied .",
    "particle loss of the condensates gives rise to the decoherence @xcite .",
    "atom loss is caused by inelastic collisions between atoms , and it is the dominant source of decoherence in the bec s @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec ii , we introduce the coupled atom - bec system .",
    "the coupling of a single two - level atom to a single bec and a two - component bec are examined .",
    "both cases can be shown to map to a qubit - oscillator model . in sec iii",
    ", we describe our scheme to probe the decoherence of condensates when they are initially in coherent and thermal states . in sec iv",
    ", we discuss the main decoherence sources of the bec s and the limitations of tuning the scattering length with feshbach resonances in sec v.",
    "we consider a single atom with two hyperfine spin states trapped in the motional ground state of a potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of this two - level atom is written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy splitting , @xmath0 and @xmath12 are the upper and lower states respectively .",
    "this spin - half system can be expressed in terms of pauli operator : @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian can be cast in the form as @xmath16    we study a single atom coupling to a single bec and a two - component bec respectively .",
    "we discuss these two cases in the following two subsections .",
    "we first consider the single atom coupled to a condensate .",
    "the hamiltonian of a bec confined in a trapping potential is given by , @xmath17\\psi_1(r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the annihilator field operator at the position @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the external trapping potential , @xmath21 is the self - interaction strength and @xmath22 is the mass of an atom .",
    "the condensate is assumed to be trapped in a deep potential such that the bec can be well described within the single - mode approximation @xcite , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the annihilator operator and the mode function of the condensate respectively .",
    "then , the hamiltonian is written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the energy frequency and the self - interaction strength respectively .",
    "the single two - level atom interacts with the condensates via coherent collisions .",
    "the hamiltonian describes such coupling as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the wavefunction of the single atom and @xmath32 is the s - wave scattering length between the atom at the upper state @xmath0 and the condensate .",
    "we consider this single atom trapped in a state - dependent potential @xcite so that only the upper state @xmath0 interacts with the condensate @xcite . besides",
    ", we assume that coherent collisions between atom and the bec will not further excite the motional state of the single atom .",
    "otherwise , it will give rise to the additional noise and affect our detection scheme .",
    "the size of the ground state wavefunction of the atom and the bec are roughly equal to the trap size .",
    "we denote the `` volume '' of the trap as @xmath33 .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath34 can be found as @xmath35 . in general , this interaction strength is weak .",
    "nevertheless , the scattering length @xmath32 can be greatly increased by tuning an external magnetic field near a feshbach resonance so that the interaction strength is greatly enhanced @xcite .",
    "this is a very useful tool for controlling the atom - bec coupling .",
    "next , we consider the single atom to be coupled to a two - component bec .",
    "the hamiltonian of a two - component condensate is given by @xmath36\\psi_\\alpha(r),\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the annihilator field operator for the component @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the trapping potential , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the intra - component and inter - component interactions respectively , and @xmath42 .    as before ,",
    "we adopt the single - mode approximation on the two component condensates in which they are confined in a deep potential @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the annihilation operator and the mode function for the component @xmath38 respectively .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath46 where the energy frequency @xmath47 , the self - interaction strength @xmath48 and the inter - component interaction strength @xmath49 .",
    "it is convenient to express the hamiltonian in terms of the angular momentum operators as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "we consider the single atom coupled to the two - component bec via coherent collisions .",
    "the hamiltonian for such an atom - bec coupling has the form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the s - wave scattering length between the atom in state @xmath0 and the component @xmath38 .",
    "we can rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of the angular momentum operators as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the total number of atoms .",
    "the constant term will be omitted in the subsequent discussion . to strengthen the atom - bec coupling",
    ", we can increase the scattering length between the atom and one of the components by adjusting a magnetic field approaching a feshbach resonance .",
    "for example , we can modulate the magnetic field to increase the scattering length between the excited state @xmath0 and the component @xmath63 .",
    "in fact , the collective excitations of the two mode condensates behave like a harmonic oscillator .",
    "this can be shown by taking the leading approximation based on the holstein - primakoff transformation ( hpt ) @xcite to map the angular momentum operators into the harmonic oscillators : @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this approximation is valid as long as the excitations are very small @xcite , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the effective atom - bec hamiltonian can be readily obtained @xmath68 we assume the interaction strength @xmath69 and @xmath70 are unequal to each other , i.e. , @xmath71",
    ". the state of collective excitations of the bec can be approximated as a coherent state @xmath72 @xcite and @xmath73 is the mean excitations of the two - component condensate .",
    "the amount of mean excitations can be adjusted by using a two - photon rabi pulse @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , both the single and two - component bec s can be described as harmonic oscillators . in other words ,",
    "the single atom ( qubit ) is effectively coupled to a harmonic oscillator .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian in both cases are of the same form and can be written as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath7 are the annihilation operator and the frequency of the harmonic oscillator respectively , @xmath34 is the strength of the nonlinearities and @xmath76 is the qubit - oscillator coupling strength .",
    "we consider the interaction strength @xmath76 is much stronger than the strength @xmath34 so that the effect of nonlinearities arising from particle interactions can be ignored in the quantum dynamics . the strength @xmath34 is roughly equal to 100hz @xcite for the trap frequency around 1 khz .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath76 can be enhanced to several times @xmath34 by approaching the feshbach resonance with a magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the system is equivalent to a qubit - harmonic oscillator system without any non - linearity .",
    "we present a scheme to detect the decoherence of the bec .",
    "the dominant decoherence source of the bec s is the atom loss due to three - body inelastic collisions @xcite .",
    "the master equation for the condensate is given by @xcite @xmath77,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the three - body coefficient , @xmath75 and @xmath80 is the destruction operator and the mode function of the condensate mode respectively .",
    "remarkably , in the limit of large number of atoms , the master equation ( @xmath81 ) can be well approximate to the one - body master equation but with a new dissipation parameter @xmath4 @xcite : @xmath82,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 .",
    "for the case of two - component bec , we assume the atom loss mainly coming from one of the components , say @xmath63 .",
    "we note that losing one atom in the component @xmath63 results in one loss in the relative population @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the process of atom loss in the two - component bec can be described by the master equation ( @xmath85 ) in the large atom number limit .",
    "the master equation ( [ 1body ] ) can be solved exactly and its solution is best expressed in the coherent state basis . in our paper we will require the time evolution of density operator terms of the form @xmath86 , where @xmath72 and @xmath87 are two coherent states differing by a rotation in phase space , under the master equation ( [ 1body ] ) . up to a normalization constant , the time evolution of the above term is of the form @xcite , @xmath88 for the short times , i.e. , @xmath89 , one can approximate @xmath90 and @xmath91 as @xmath92 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "this is a good approximation for an underdamped oscillator if the dectection timescale @xmath93 is much shorter than the dissipation timescale @xmath94 .",
    "note that the decoherence time - scale @xmath95 can still be comparable to @xmath93 , so that the decoherence can be detected .",
    "in addition , we assume that the two - level atom has very long coherence times so that it can act as a faithful microscopic probe to detect the decoherence .",
    "in fact , the long coherence times of the atomic condensates with two hyperfine states have been measured using ramsey spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "our scheme is very simple in which involves a few procedures only .",
    "first , we perform a unitary transformation of the two - level atom to create an equal superposition of the states @xmath12 and @xmath0 whereas the bec is prepared as a coherent state .",
    "such the unitary transformation can be easily made by a rabi pulse @xcite .",
    "initially , a separable state of the two - level atom and the harmonic oscillator is considered as @xmath96 and @xmath72 is a coherent state . to manifest the evolution of the atom - bec system",
    ", we first consider the case without the decoherence setting in .",
    "the atom becomes entangled with the harmonic oscillator just after switching on the atom - bec interaction .",
    "the state can be written as @xmath97 where @xmath98 , for @xmath99 .",
    "the atom - bec interaction gives rise to a rotation of coherent state in phase space .",
    "thus , the phase shifts of the condensate are acquired according to the states @xmath12 and @xmath0 respectively . as a result ,",
    "a superposition of two coherent states are generated .",
    "the `` distance '' @xmath100 in phase space between the two states can be defined as @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath5 can indicate the `` distance '' of the superpositions . however , the atom completely disentangles with the bec at time @xmath102 and the state reads @xmath103 at time @xmath104 , the density matrix evolves as @xmath105,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "the decoherence factor @xmath112 appears in the terms @xmath113 and @xmath114 . at the end of detection times @xmath115",
    ", the density matrix reads @xmath116\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\otimes\\frac{1}{2}|\\alpha(t')\\rangle\\langle\\alpha(t')|.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the atom disentangles with the condensate and the condensate is brought back to its original state .",
    "the atom - bec coupling can be effectively switched off by tuning the external magnetic field and then we can slowly move out the atom from the bec . then",
    ", the state of atom is measured and the probability of single atom at the state @xmath117 can be found as @xmath118 if the initial state of the atom @xmath119 is considered , where @xmath120 is the phase shift between the states @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "the partial coherence factor @xmath121 appears in the probability of the state @xmath117 .",
    "the measurement of the visibility of the fringes as a function of @xmath120 leads us to determining the factor @xmath121 .",
    "since the instantaneous superposition of states decoheres as @xmath122 , therefore the average value of the decoherence rate @xmath123 can be evaluated as @xmath124 the average rate @xmath123 can be obtained as @xmath125 . therefore , the decoherence factor @xmath126 after the completion of the probing process is given by @xmath127 .",
    "we can probe the decoherence factor @xmath128 by measuring of the probability of the excited state of the single atom .",
    "hence , the damping rate @xmath4 of the bec can be determined .",
    "the temperature of the bec is nearly absolute zero , indeed its temperature ranges from 100 nk to 500 pk @xcite .",
    "the state of the bec can be well described as a thermal state if the finite temperature is taken account .",
    "our detection can be used for probing the decoherence with the initial thermal state .",
    "this enables us to study the decoherence due to the finite temperature effect .",
    "initially , the density matrix is of the form @xmath129 where @xmath130 are probabilities @xmath131 .",
    "the evolution of the density matrix at time @xmath104 is @xmath132,\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the decoherence factor at time @xmath134 for each @xmath38 .",
    "finally , the atom disentangles with the condensate and the density matrix is found to be @xmath135\\otimes{\\int}d^2{\\alpha}{p(\\alpha)}|\\alpha(t')\\rangle\\langle\\alpha(t')|\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{mixed}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the decohernce factor @xmath136 sums up all contributions from the decoherence of the different possible coherent states @xmath72 .",
    "similarly , the decoherence factor @xmath137 can be detected through the measurement of the visibility of the atom .",
    "we have shown that our scheme can be used to probe the decoherence of the condensates with the initial coherent and thermal states . in fact , as eq.([mixed ] ) is valid for any distribution @xmath130 , the scheme is valid for any mixture of coherent states being the initial state of the condensate .",
    "so for example , if the amplitude of the coherent state was known but its phase was completely unknown , our method of probing decoherence would still be applicable .",
    "the main decoherence sources of the bec are three - body inelastic collisions and collisions with the background gas @xcite .",
    "we sort out several noise sources of the bec s and discuss them as follows :      _ background gases and spontaneous light scattering : _ the background gases and spontaneous emission contribute the one - body loss and thus induce the decoherence of the bec s @xcite .",
    "the loss rate @xmath138 is of the form @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the one - body loss coefficient .",
    "however , such decoherence effect is weak in the current experiment circumstance @xcite .    _",
    "two - body and three - body inelastic collisions : _ the two - body inelastic collisions are very rare in the atomic condensates and its loss rate is @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the two - body coefficient and @xmath33 is the volume of the trapped bec . the inelastic collisions mainly occurs due to the three - body collisions @xcite . the rate of decoherence @xmath4 is @xmath143 , where @xmath79 is the three - body coefficient .",
    "the three - body coefficient @xmath79 is about @xmath144 @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "it is noted that inelastic collisions are greatly enhanced near feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "however , we assume this effect is minimal to our detection scheme if the probing times are very short .",
    "phase damping describes a process of the loss of the coherence without losing energy .",
    "elastic collisions between the bec and the surrounding gases can cause phase damping @xcite .",
    "the elastic scattering with vacuum noises can also contribute the dephasing .",
    "however , our scheme is not applicable in detecting the phase damping for the coherent states with the same magnitude @xmath73 but with the different phases .",
    "the decoherence factor can not be imprinted on the atom .",
    "in fact , the dephasing rate @xmath146 depends on the temperature of the gases and therefore its rate is very low in the current experiments of the bec @xcite .",
    "the decoherence timescale of the phase damping is much longer than that of the atom loss .",
    "thus , the dephasing effect is negligible compared to the atom loss .",
    "our scheme involves the active control of the scattering length using a magnetic field approaching feshbach resonances .",
    "we can greatly increase the scattering length @xmath24 with the feshbach resonance and therefore speed up the process of creating superpositions .",
    "the scattering length @xmath24 is varied as a function of external magnetic field b @xcite : @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the off - resonant scattering length , @xmath149 is the resonant magnetic field and @xmath150 is the width of the feshbach resonance .",
    "nevertheless , the change of scattering length @xmath24 will accompany with an increasing three - body inelastic collisions rate .",
    "the rate of three - body collisions loss increases to 20(60 ) times for the low magnetic field of sodium atoms @xcite .",
    "this limits the use of feshbach resonance to create a superposition state . in the worst case",
    ", the single atom may be lost due to the formation of molecules @xcite .",
    "then , our scheme is no longer applicable  of course , if we loose the atom from our trap , we no longer continue with that run of the experiment and simply restart the experiment with a fresh atomic qubit .",
    "it is quite possible , though , to maintain the coherence of the single atom and create superpositions with a fast ramp speed @xcite .",
    "thus , our scheme can be applied to the situation that the detection rate is much shorter than the decay rate .",
    "in summary , we have studied the coupling of a single atom to the single and two - component bec s respectively .",
    "we have presented a scheme to create mesoscopic superpositions involving distinct classical - like ( or coherent ) states of the bec and probe their decoherence .",
    "the probing of the decoherence is applicable to both initial coherent and thermal states of the bec .",
    "only the state of the atom state needs to be directly measured in this experiment to probe the decoherence of the bec .",
    "the various noise sources leading to the decoherence of the condensates are also discussed .",
