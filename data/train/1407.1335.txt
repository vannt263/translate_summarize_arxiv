    "atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite constitute a platform that is ideal for the study of numerous nonlinear - wave phenomena ( see , e.g. , reviews in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the particularly interesting directions in that regard is the study of multicomponent bec systems and solitary waves in them .",
    "this is a subject of broad interest , not only in the realm of atomic becs , but also in nonlinear optics  @xcite as well as in studies of integrable systems in mathematical physics  @xcite .",
    "arguably , one of the most intriguing coherent structures in the multicomponent settings in the presence of defocusing nonlinearities ( in terms of optical systems ) or repulsive interatomic interactions ( in becs ) are dark - bright ( db ) solitons .",
    "in particular , exact solutions for such states are available in the well - known integrable self - defocusing two - component manakov system  @xcite .",
    "generally , the db solitons are ubiquitous in two - component systems , i.e. , the nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlses ) or gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) , in which both the self - phase - modulation ( spm ) and cross - phase - modulation ( xpm ) terms are represented by cubic terms .    in the db structures",
    ", the customary dark soliton of the defocusing nlse induces an effective potential , via the xpm interaction , in the other component , which in turn gives rise to self - trapping of bright - soliton states in the latter component .",
    "this possibility has been studied extensively in atomic becs ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "buschanglin , ddb , kanna , rajendran , val , berloff , vb , alvarez , vaspra , vasnjp ) .",
    "such waveforms have been reported in experiments both in two - component bec mixtures , which make use of two different atomic states of @xmath0rb sengdb , peterprl , peter1,peter2,peterpra , peter3 , and in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "the bec experimental studies have examined the dynamics of a single db soliton in a trap  @xcite , the generation of multiple db solitons in a counterflow experiment  peterprl ( see also the theoretical work of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , db soliton interactions  @xcite , and the creation of su(2)-rotated db solitons , in the form of beating dark - dark solitons @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present work is to extend this fundamental structural idea for the existence of db solitary waves beyond the previously studied integrable or close - to - integrable limit of the manakov model .",
    "in fact , the nearly integrable setting has been especially useful and relevant to the experiment due to the fact that the ratios of interspecies and intraspecies interactions between different hyperfine atomic states of @xmath0rb in the bec mixtures ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as well as @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) are very close to unity @xcite .",
    "the dispersion coefficients in this setting are equal too , as they are determined by the same atomic weight .",
    "it is relevant to note in passing that , quite recently  @xcite , the studies of spin - orbit - coupled becs  @xcite have led to a set of coupled gpes ( via a multiple - scale reduction scheme ) , where the effective dispersion coefficients could differ substantially ( and controllably ) , as they depend on the curvature of the corresponding dispersion relation of the two - component branches .",
    "a similar situation is in principle possible for a binary condensate loaded into a periodic spin - dependent potential , in which case the effective mass may be altered differently by the potential for two atomic states with different spins .",
    "the possibility of having different dispersion prefactors ( which , of course , are also different in the system of coupled gpes corresponding to a heteronuclear binary bec ) in the model producing the db solitary waves is the main motivation for the analysis reported below . in particular , if we assume that the dark soliton in the one component induces an approximately frozen effective potential in the other one ( reserved for carrying a bright - soliton structure ) , then varying the dispersion coefficient allows us to modulate the depth and width of the effective potential . in so doing ,",
    "we can trap different bound modes , representing the ground state or excited ones , at the level of the linear approximation for the bright component .",
    "the analysis presented in sec .",
    "ii allows us then to infer the value of the dispersion coefficient along with the respective eigenvalue ( the chemical potential ) for which such multiple states are accessible .",
    "another intriguing case is the limit of vanishing dispersion of the second component .",
    "given the algebraic [ thomas - fermi ( tf ) ] nature of the second equation in that limit , we can treat that case analytically and then test the solutions numerically ( this is presented in sec .",
    "ii as well ) . based on these aspects of the analysis ( the linear and nonlinear tf limits )",
    ", we then numerically examine the emergence of nonlinear states from the predicted bifurcation points of the linear theory and their continuation ( when possible , all the way to the zero - dispersion limit ) . identifying these solutions",
    ", we also explore their stability against small perturbations , concluding , quite naturally , that higher excited states , i.e. , bright solitary waves with a larger number of nodes , are more prone to instability .",
    "for unstable states , we simulate the dynamical development of the instability , which often involves mobility of the coherent structure , and possibilities of destruction of higher excited states or their reshaping into lower ones .",
    "this computational analysis is performed in sec .",
    "iii . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we summarize our findings and present conclusions and highlight directions for future studies .",
    "the considerations reported in this paper provide us with a systematic means for unveiling a whole series of previously unexplored families of solutions in the two - component nlse - gpe system . actually , with the exception of the fundamental db soliton ( i.e. , the simplest among the considered states , with a nodeless bright component ) , understanding of the existence and especially stability of such states , as well as of their nonlinear dynamical behavior ,",
    "is presently very limited .",
    "it is therefore the purpose of this work to find out which of these states are stable and in what parameter regions . for unstable states ,",
    "our intention is to reveal mechanisms through which the instabilities manifest themselves , as well as eventual configurations into which the unstable states are driven .",
    "these issues turn out to be by no means trivial , involving both mobility and different scenarios of transformation into different types of robust configurations .    to conclude the introduction ,",
    "it is relevant to note that two - component nlses with unequal dispersion coefficients give rise to other families of unusual states , a known example being symbiotic bright solitary waves in heteronuclear binary becs @xcite .",
    "they are supported by the interplay of repulsive self - interactions and attractive cross interactions between the components , which is essentially different from the setting considered in the present work .",
    "given that the underlying model is relevant to both atomic becs and nonlinear optics , we present it in the general form of the coupled nls equations . to this end , we consider the coupled nls system written in the following dimensionless form :    @xmath5    [ start_manakov ]    with dispersion coefficients @xmath6 , nonlinearity strength @xmath7 , interaction coefficients @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ) , and an external harmonic potential @xmath11 , of the form @xmath12 , with normalized trap strength @xmath13 . in becs of different species ,",

    "[ fig4b ] ] . an additional feature that arises in the latter figures",
    "is well known in the context of discrete systems as a finite - size effect and was introduced in ref .",
    "this is related to the fact that the continuous spectrum of background ( phonon ) excitations is discretized on our spatial grid , hence complex eigenfrequencies may return to the real eigenfrequency axis temporarily before colliding with another pair to exit again as quartets .",

    "[ fig8d ] and [ fig8e ] , a rapid destruction of the @xmath39 state occurs again , this time directly transforming it into a fundamental traveling - wave structure . in figs .",
    "[ fig8j ] and [ fig8k ] , a more complex scenario arises , with the dark soliton splitting off into apparently gray ones , the fastest of which is not accompanied by a bright counterpart . as a result",
    ", the bright component disperses , maintaining , however , some of its nodal structure . finally , in figs .",
    "[ fig8 m ] and [ fig8n ] ( once again , for @xmath39 ) , the third excited state ( the second spatially odd one ) transforms itself into the corresponding first excited state maintaining , again , breathing oscillations .",
    "it is worth noting that , for the fundamental branch , there is at most a translational ( imaginary ) eigenfrequency responsible for the instability .",
    "it is thus rather natural that its manifestation in direct simulations involves mobility . however , as we progressively move to higher excited states , the number of potentially unstable modes increases , creating an oscillatory instability for @xmath34 , two instabilities for @xmath37 , and so on , in accord with figs",
    ".  [ fig6 ] ,  [ fig7 ] , etc .",
    "it is the intricate interplay of these distinct dynamical instabilities ( often with comparable growth rates ) that is responsible for the resulting complex dynamics .",
    "in the present work we have revisited the model based on two - component nonlinear schrdinger equations with defocusing nonlinearity , which plays a fundamental role in nonlinear optics , as well as in the description of repulsively interacting binary bec mixtures . we have examined the fundamental dynamical features of dark - bright solitons , namely , the formation of the effective potential well for the bright component induced by the dark one via the xpm interaction . using the dispersion coefficient of the bright component as a control parameter",
    ", we modified the depth of the effective potential well , enabling the formation of higher - order excited bound states in this well , including those with @xmath116 , and @xmath117 nodes .",
    "these may be considered as dark - in - bright solitary structures  @xcite or as excited states trapped in the potential well .",
    "we have shown that , while the ground single - peak state is generally very robust ( except for the case of large difference between the dispersion coefficients of the two components ) , this is not true for the excited states , which are subject to progressively wider intervals of both exponential and oscillatory instabilities .",
    "the instability of the ground state leads to motion of the db soliton , but does not destroy it . for the excited states with progressively increasing @xmath32 , the complexity of the evolution scenarios also increases , resulting from the interplay of the increasing number of instability modes .",
    "exotic scenarios involve the fusion of the dark - in - bright solitary waves , the explosion of the waveforms into multiple splinters , and relaxation , either abruptly or gradually , into less excited states , possibly accompanied by breathing .",
    "the present analysis suggests a number of paths for future studies .",
    "one possibility might be to expand on the exact solutions identified herein for @xmath48 beyond this special limit , using a perturbative expansion to explore both their existence and , potentially , also their stability in the limit of small @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , one can extend the present considerations to the quite important ( e.g. , in bec ) and widely studied class of spinor systems , involving more than two components  @xcite . following this possibility",
    ", one can envision , in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , one dark component creating a potential for the other two bright components , which could be found either in the same or , for suitable parametric regimes , possibly in different states of their respective potential wells .",
    "this would be a particularly intriguing setup to explore , as concerns its existence and stability properties .",
    "furthermore , we note that the possibility of one component forming a well for another one is independent of the spatial dimension .",
    "for instance , in two dimensions the notion of vortex - bright solitons  @xcite is a by - product of the same type of potential approach ( the topological charge of the vortices is not experienced by the bright component when the interaction is incoherent , i.e. , the potential well is solely determined by the density distribution in the vortex ) . here",
    "it would be interesting to explore what type of excited states could be created , such as a dark - in - bright ring and associated multi ring states , _ inter alia_.",
