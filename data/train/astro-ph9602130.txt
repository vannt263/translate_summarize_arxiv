    "what is the most stable form of baryonic matter at high density ?",
    "this question is of both observational and theoretical interests . with the discovery of pulsars and their identification with the neutron stars in the late 60s",
    ", many people thought that neutron star matter is the most stable form of cold condensed matter at high density .",
    "this believe was later challenged by witten .",
    "he proposed that at sufficiently high density , deconfinement of nucleons occurs .",
    "moreover , some of the d and u quarks on of the fermi surface is converted to strange quarks via weak interaction .",
    "thus , the most stable form of matter at ultra - high density is a degenerate mixture of u , d , and s quarks together with a small amount of electrons so as to maintain overall charge neutrality ( @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of material state is called strange matter .",
    "his idea was examined in detail later by farhi and jaffe ( 1984 ) .",
    "the possibility of self gravitating strange matter , namely , a strange star , has also been investigated .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) calculations of strange star suggests that they are indeed stable objects in certain parameter range ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "the mass and radius of a stable strange star are found to be similar to those of a neutron star .",
    "consequently , some authors suggested that pulsars are in fact strange stars ( see for example @xcite ) . in principle , the question of whether pulsars are neutron or strange stars can be answered by comparing the core density of a neutron star to the strange matter transition density .",
    "unfortunately , all the nuclear physics calculations to date do not yield a definitive answer .",
    "there are a number of difficulties in explaining some of the observational properties of pulsars using the strange star model .",
    "the first , and perhaps the most serious difficulty , is the possibility of a strange star glitch . early eos calculations suggested that strange stars have very thin nuclear matter crust .",
    "the ratio of inertial moment of the nuclear matter crust to that of the whole strange star is of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the density of the nuclear matter crust is not high enough for neutron drip ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , pulsar glitch observations tell us that the ratio of inertial moment of pinned neutron superfluid crust to that of the whole star is about @xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . nevertheless , by taking into account the existence of strange matter bound states , benvenuto et al .",
    "( 1991ab ) showed that strange star may support a `` strange matter crust '' thick enough to account for the observed pulsar glitches .",
    "besides , a more recent calculation suggested that a strange star may be able to retain a reasonable size of nuclear matter crust by accretion as well ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second difficulty is the possibility of type  i x - ray bursts on a strange star surface .",
    "it is commonly believed that type  i x - ray burst involves sudden thermo - nuclear runaway at the surface of an accreting neutron star ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the same bursting behavior can not occur on a bare strange star surface because nuclear fuel will dissociate into constituent quarks immediately ( @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of x - ray burst , therefore , requires the existence of a nuclear matter crust over a strange star .",
    "eos calculations showed that the nuclear matter crust is separated from the interior strange matter by a electrostatic gap of a few fermi thick , thereby preventing the nuclear matter from converting into strange matter ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a strange pulsar magnetosphere can also be formed , giving rise to the observed radio pulsation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the final difficulty is the magnetic field decay time . assuming a _ normal _ strange matter core",
    ", jones ( 1988 ) pointed that magnetic field inside a strange star will not decay in hubble s time .",
    "moreover , there is no obvious mechanism for the star to retain a small residual field after say @xmath3 years .",
    "therefore , it is inconsistent with both the pulsar magnetic field decay hypothesis , and the spun - up formation scenario of milli - second pulsars ( @xcite ) . nevertheless , the statistical evidence for pulsar magnetic field decay over a period of some @xmath3  yr is still inconclusive .",
    "also , milli - second pulsars may rather form by accretion induced collapse of white dwarfs ( see for example @xcite and @xcite for discussions on neutron star magnetic field decay ) . therefore ,",
    "the objection of jones may not be completely well founded .",
    "moreover , as i shall discuss in ",
    "[ s : sm ] , the core of a strange star is likely to be superconducting . in this case",
    ", the magnetic field decay time estimated by jones ( 1988 ) has to be modified .",
    "the question of magnetic field decay have been brought up in the review paper by bailin and love ( 1984 ) .",
    "they briefly mentioned that the low electron density in the strange stellar core may lead to rapid flux expulsion .",
    "however , they did not provide a detail calculation .",
    "a major objective of this paper , therefore , is to perform such a calculation , taking into account the coupling between magnetic evolution and rotational dynamics of the star in the presence of collective effects such as clumping of flux tubes .    at this moment , one has no doubt that the standard neutron star model for pulsars is well tested by numerous observational data .",
    "however , we still have to keep a close look at the alternative hypothesis , namely , the strange pulsar model ( @xcite ) . in particular , we like to explore various physical properties of a neutron star and a strange star , and to see if there are further ways to test if which of the two models is a better candidate in explaining pulsar observations .    as i shall discuss in ",
    "[ s : sm ] , the core of a strange star is likely to be superconducting ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , this cast a problem on the rotation of a strange star . in order to rotate an object with one superconducting species ,",
    "a uniform magnetic field @xmath4 called the london field , is set up in the object ( @xcite ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the effective mass and charge of the cooper pair , and @xmath7 is the rotational angular velocity of the object .",
    "but for a strange star , u , d , and s quarks are all superconducting .",
    "these superconducting species require different values of @xmath8 to set up a rotation .",
    "thus , we have a _ frustrated _ system .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that all three superconducting quark flavors interact strongly with each other . in  [ s : rotate ] , i tackle this rotation problem using ginzburg - landau formalism . instead of setting up a uniform london field , i find that vortices and localized magnetic fields are created when the superconducting quarks rotate together .",
    "then in  [ s : ap ] , i point out that the vortices will inter - pin with the magnetic flux tubes , which alter the magnetic field evolution and rotation of a strange star dramatically . in particular , it suggests that the ( superconducting ) strange pulsar hypothesis is inconsistent with the observed magnetic field decay time in pulsars .",
    "finally , a conclusion is drawn in  [ s : conclude ] .",
    "using a relativistic treatment of the bcs theory , bailin and love ( 1982 , 1984 ) suggested that strange matter turns superconducting at low temperatures . using perturbative qcd at the one gluon exchange level",
    ", they showed that the pairing of quarks is most likely to occur in both the ud - du and the ss channels .",
    "the ss pairing is expected to have a gap matrix transforming as a color @xmath9 and having @xmath10 ( and hence the pairing is in p - wave ) . on the other hand , pairing in the u - d system is expected to occur in the isoscalar channel , with a gap matrix transforming as a color @xmath11 and having @xmath12 ( and hence the pairing is in s - wave ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature is about @xmath13  kev .",
    "incidentally , the transition temperatures for neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in a neutron star core are of the same order of magnitude . thus",
    ", about 1000  yr after its supernova birth , the interior of a typical strange star is already cold enough for quark superconductivity ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , one should notice that the above estimation depends quite sensitively on the quark - gluon coupling , and may also change if one goes beyond the one gluon exchange calculations .",
    "thus , the existence of a superconducting core in a strange star is not completely conclusive even though it is very likely .",
    "nonetheless , i assume the existence of quark superconductivity in a strange star core in this paper .",
    "the quark superconductor is likely to be marginally type  i with a zero temperature critical field @xmath14 about @xmath15  g ( @xcite ) .",
    "incidentally , the lower critical field of proton superconductor at the core of a neutron star is also of this order .",
    "the typical magnetic field of a canonical pulsar is about @xmath16  g , so naively one would expect complete flux expulsion from the superconducting strange matter core",
    ". however , the huge electrical conductivity of the normal state opposes the motion of the flux , thereby , leading to a long flux expulsion time . in the case of a neutron star core ,",
    "the flux expulsion time is @xmath17  years ( @xcite ) . this time is shorter for strange stars because of their low electron density and strong quark - quark scattering amplitude .",
    "bailin and love ( 1982 ) predicted that it may be as little as @xmath18  yr .",
    "however , their estimate did not take into account the possibility of flux clumping , which may greatly increase the flux expulsion time .",
    "moreover , if the flux expulsion rate is so fast , then a meissner state is formed in an old pulsar . as we shall point out in ",
    "[ s : stru ] , the thin crustal nuclear matter is not strong enough to support the magnetic stress and tension of the expelled field .",
    "therefore , we believe that during the life of a canonical pulsar , a meta - stable state with magnetic field penetrating through the superconducting strange star core has to be formed",
    ". we shall return to this point later in ",
    "[ s : ap ] .",
    "since the quark superfluid also couples to the color vector gluons , color superconductivity may also be observed .",
    "because of color confinement outside the stellar core , we do not have the color analogue of the ambient @xmath16  g magnetic field ( @xcite ) . thus , the observational consequences of color superconductivity remains unclear .",
    "as i have discussed in  [ s : intro ] , london magnetic field is set up when a single species of superconducting sample is rotated ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the presence of london field has been observed in terrestrial superconductors ( @xcite ) . in  [ s : rotate_1 ] , we re - derive the expression in eq .",
    "( [ e : london ] ) using ginzburg - landau formalism as a warm up to the multi - superconducting - component situation like that in a strange star . in the derivation",
    ", i find that there is a critical angular velocity above which the uniform london field state is not the most energetically stable configuration .",
    "this critical angular velocity , as far as i know , has not been investigated in the literature .",
    "unfortunately , such a critical angular velocity is too high to be attained experimentally .",
    "we assume that the cooper pairs in the sample are in the s - state .",
    "thus , the order parameter for the only superconducting species @xmath19 is complex . in case",
    "the cooper pairs are in higher angular momentum state , the order parameter will be a complex matrix ( @xcite ) .",
    "we , however , shall only stick to the simple s - wave pairing derivation .",
    "similar results also apply to higher angular momentum pairing states although the derivation becomes rather complicated . for a sufficiently small angular velocity @xmath7 and sample size ,",
    "it is reasonable that the speed of the superfluid is not high at any point and hence a non - relativistic treatment will suffice . in the co - rotating frame ,",
    "the ginzburg - landau energy functional reads as @xmath20 where @xmath21 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the _ effective _ mass and charge of the cooper pairs .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 so that the superconducting state is prefered over the normal state . in general , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are temperature dependent . however , a few hundred years after its supernova birth the cooling timescale for a strange star is much longer than its spin - down timescale .",
    "thus , as far as rotational dynamics of the star is concerned , we may assume that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constants .",
    "we consider the case when there is no external magnetic field .",
    "the presence of an external magnetic field may simply create extra fluxoids in the sample , which is not very interesting .",
    "there are two ways to minimize the kinetic energy term in eq .",
    "( [ e : gl_1 ] ) .",
    "first , we can set up a magnetic field so that the @xmath25 contribution is cancelled by @xmath26 .",
    "alternatively , we can create normal cores ( i.e. line defects in the form of vortices similar to that of a rotating superfluid ) . however , there are prices to pay for both cases : setting up magnetic field requires magnetic energy ; setting up vortex needs both a kinetic energy near the vortex and a nucleation energy for creation of the vortex core .",
    "what really happens in the sample , in general , is that a uniform magnetic field together with an array of vortices will be formed when it is rotated .",
    "suppose a uniform magnetic field @xmath27 ( parallel to @xmath28 ) is set up in the star , then @xmath29 .",
    "then in order to minimize the kinetic energy term in eq .",
    "( [ e : gl_1 ] ) , vortices ( or anti - vortices ) have to be formed just like a rotating superfluid ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "unlike fluxoids , vortices carries circulation but not magnetic field .",
    "the number of vortex ( or anti - vortex ) per unit area required is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the circulation quantum .",
    "obviously , vortices forms an abrikosov lattice in the absence of spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "the ginzburg - landau free energy per unit volume of the system is , therefore , given by ( @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath32 + \\frac{1}{2 }   \\,\\pi \\xi^2 n(0 ) \\delta^2 \\right\\ } \\,n(b ) \\mbox{~ , } \\label{e : f_1}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the density of superconducting species , @xmath34 is the coherence length of the vortex , @xmath35 is the upper cutoff length which is of the order of the inter - vortex spacing , @xmath36 is the superconducting gap energy , and @xmath37 is the density of state for one spin projection on the fermi surface which is given by @xmath38_{k = k_f } \\approx \\frac{e_f^3}{2\\pi^2   \\hbar^3 c^3 } \\label{e : n0_def}\\ ] ] in the extreme relativistic limit .",
    "physically , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ e : f_1 ] ) is the magnetic energy , and the second term is the kinetic and nucleation energies of the vortices . by minimizing eq .",
    "( [ e : f_1 ] ) , we find that the magnetic field generated in the star is @xmath39 + 2\\pi^2 \\xi^2 n(0 ) \\delta^2",
    "\\right\\ } & \\hspace{0.25 in } \\mbox{otherwise } \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\mbox{~ , }   \\label{e : b_1}\\ ] ] where we have neglected the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath8 because it is rather weak .",
    "the critical angular velocity @xmath41 above which vortices begin to form and the translational symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken can be determined from eqs .",
    "( [ e : london ] ) and  ( [ e : b_1 ] ) . and",
    "it is given by @xmath42    since magnetic energy scales quadratically with magnetic field while the energy required to form an array of vortices scales linearly with it , formation of vortices is favored at high rotational rates .",
    "for a typical terrestrial superconductor ( high or low @xmath43 ) , the effective charge and mass of the cooper pairs are given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . by putting @xmath46  g@xmath47 , we obtain @xmath48  rads@xmath49 .",
    "similarly , for neutron star matter , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52  g@xmath47 , @xmath53  rads@xmath49 . @xmath41 for strange star matter is similar to that of a neutron star .",
    "these angular velocities , unfortunately , are so high that the sample or the star will break apart well before the formation of vortices . in other words , we can neglect the magnetic energy contribution in the ginzburg - landau free energy all the time .",
    "now we examine the case when there are more than one superconducting species .",
    "we consider the simple case when they are non - interacting .",
    "thus , the only coupling between them is that they response to the _ same _ vector potential @xmath26 .",
    "if we label each superconducting species by @xmath54 , the ginzburg - landau free energy density is @xmath55 once again , we expect each superconducting species to form vortices in addition to the generation of a common magnetic field .",
    "( compare with mendell and lindblom ( 1991 ) for a similar study using hydrodynamics . ) as we have shown in ",
    "[ s : rotate_1 ] , we can neglect the magnetic energy contribution . as a result , for a uniform magnetic field @xmath8",
    ", the ginzburg - landau free energy per unit volume becomes @xmath56 + \\frac{m_j^ *   \\xi_j^2}{2 \\hbar } n_j(0 ) \\delta_j^2 \\right\\ } \\,\\left| \\omega - \\frac{q_j^*}{2   m_j^ * c } b \\right| \\mbox{~. } \\label{e : f_m}\\ ] ] as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : f_v ] , for a fix @xmath7 , the free energy density contribution of each superconducting species assumes its minimum value when @xmath8 equals its london magnetic field . neglecting the weak dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath8",
    ", @xmath58 is a continuous and piecewise linear function of @xmath8 with `` vertices '' locate at the points where @xmath8 equals the london magnetic field of any one of its superconducting species .",
    "thus , the actual magnetic field @xmath8 set up in the sample always equals to a london magnetic field of a particular superconducting species . in other words",
    ", at least one superconducting species rotates _ without _ creating vortices . while other species with a different london field have to create vortices ( or anti - vortices ) in order to rotate with the same angular velocity .",
    "this finding is somewhat unexpected because one would naively think that the value of the magnetic field set up in the sample would be a compromise between different london fields and all superconducting species would form vortices .",
    "as the superconducting species do not interact , vortices from each species will form abrikosov lattices on their own ( in the absence of spatial inhomogeneity ) .",
    "what we can predict if the quarks in strange stars were non - interacting ?",
    "since the masses ( let it be bare or consitutent ) of d and u are about the same , which are both much less than that of s , eq .  ( [ e : london ] ) tells us that their corresponding london fields satisfy @xmath59 when @xmath60 .",
    "( an exactly reverse relationship is true when @xmath61 . ) since @xmath62 ( @xcite ) , eq .",
    "( [ e : gl_m ] ) tells us that @xmath63 where @xmath64 combining eqs .",
    "( [ e : f_m ] ) ,  ( [ e : order_m ] ) and  ( [ e : g_j ] ) , the slope @xmath65 of our piecewise linear free energy density curve @xmath58 is given by @xmath66 where we have neglected the small nucleation energy contribution in the above estimate .    consequently , @xmath58 finds its minimum when @xmath67 .",
    "( readers can verify that this conclusion is independent of the sign of @xmath7 . )",
    "so if different flavor quarks were non - interacting , only s quarks would form vortices upon rotation .",
    "finally , we consider the ( realistic ) case when the quarks are interacting .",
    "the form of the free energy density must be invariant under global phase changes in any of the order parameters .",
    "if we consider terms up to second order in gradients and quartic in order parameters , the most general form of @xmath68 is given by ( compare with alpar et al .",
    "1984b where they have omitted the quartic self - interaction terms ) @xmath69 where @xmath24 is a real symmetric matrix , @xmath70 is an hermitian matrix , and @xmath71 is the covariant momentum operator in the co - rotating frame for the @xmath54-th species . since the free energy has to be bounded from below , we further require all the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix @xmath24 to be positive .    to explicitly show the drag effect of one superconducting species on the other , we write the order parameters @xmath72 as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 are the phases of the order parameters",
    "then , the velocity of the superconducting species @xmath54 in the rotating frame is given by @xmath75 where we have neglected the spatial variation of @xmath76 . from eqs .",
    "( [ e : gl_mi ] ) and  ( [ e : def_v ] ) , we have @xmath77 \\mbox{~ , } \\label{e : f_drag}\\ ] ] where    @xmath78    and @xmath79    for @xmath80 .",
    "thus , once a superconducting species moves , eq .  ( [ e : f_drag ] ) tells us that in general it is energetically favorable for the other superconducting species to move along with it as well .",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached by using three - velocity hydrodynamics ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    at the strange matter density , which is about @xmath81  gm@xmath47 ,",
    "the `` fine structure constant '' for strong force @xmath82 is about 0.5  0.6 ( @xcite ) indicating that qcd is the dominant interaction between the quark cooper pairs .",
    "the values of the off - diagonal terms of the matrix @xmath83 , which measure the strength of the drag , can be calculated ( in principle ) from the qcd interaction hamiltonian . although the large value of @xmath82 prevents us from using perturbation theory , we believe that the effective coupling constants @xmath84 and @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ e : gl_mi ] ) are at least of order of @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the drag force between different quark flavors are so strong that up to first order approximation , all three quark flavors move at the same velocity except possibly near the superfluid cores .",
    "the co - moving approximation greatly simplifies our effort to find the minimum system configuration of a strange star .    in order",
    "to minimize the drag energy , all the superconducting species have to share common normal cores .",
    "we call such a configuration a _",

    "similar to the case of superfluid neutron vortices in a rotating neutron star ( @xcite ) , eq .",
    "( [ e : f_mi ] ) tells us that in the strongly interacting limit , the quark vortex bundle density is directly proportional to the angular speed @xmath116 of the rotating strange star . as a strange star spins down , its vortex bundles in the star core have to move radially outward from the rotational axis ( and eventually some of them will annihilate near the stellar surface ) .",
    "the pinning of quark vortex bundles and magnetic flux tubes implies that the rotational and magnetic evolution of a strange star are coupled .",

    "in fact , similar ideas have been applied to the proton fluxoids and magnetic vortices in neutron star cores ; and their possible observational consequences have been studied ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the combined forces acting on a magnetic flux tube due to vortex bundles , therefore , produce a total force together with a torque ( ruderman  1991abc ) .",

    "hence , the young s modulus of this lattice is about @xmath199  dyn@xmath200 .",
    "( the young s modulus of the nuclear lattice is much smaller if it is not prefect or if the density of the crust is lower than for the neutron drip . )",

    "after some computation , i find that the maximum field and flux the nuclear crust can sustain are @xmath203  g and @xmath204  g@xmath205 respectively .",
    "this is much smaller than the initial magnetic flux of a strange pulsar .",
    "so we have two possibilities : ( a ) there is an efficient field decay mechanism operating in the thin nuclear matter crust ; or ( 2 ) the crust breaks at some point when majority of the field in the core is expelled , eventually making the star a bare strange matter object . in either case , the contribution of the magnetic field in the crust does not play an important role in the magnetic evolution of the entire star .",

    "we write @xmath208 where @xmath209 is a time dependent quantity of order of unity in most parts of the star ( @xcite ) .    what happens if the magnetic flux lines form a clump ?",
    "provided that the size of such a clump is smaller than the electron mean free path , electrons may collectively scatter with a number of flux lines within a clump leading to a dramatic change in the drag force ( @xcite ) .",

    "we model the clumping effect by a renormalization scheme . by coarse graining to the level of a clump , the behavior of the flux tubes inside a clump is similar to that of a single magnetic flux tube carrying the same amount of flux as the clump provided that the size of the clump is much smaller than the electron mean free path . in addition , the magnetic field strength in this single magnetic flux tube equals to that in each of the individual flux tubes in the clump .",

    "this finding implies the existence of vortex bundles in the core of a rotating superconducting strange star . because it is energetically favorable for the vortex bundles to pin to magnetic flux tubes , the rotational dynamics and the magnetic field evolution of a strange star are coupled .    because the nuclear crust of a strange star can not sustain a strong magnetic stress , the magnetic field evolution of the star is dictated by dynamics of the flux tubes in the core .",
    "the core magnetic field evolution due to inter - pinning of magnetic flux tubes and vortex bundles , and clumping of flux tubes is computed numerically .",
    "i find that in all reasonable parameter range , the characteristic decay time of the magnetic field is @xmath274  myr .",
    "this finding does not agree with the hypothesis that pulsars are superconducting strange stars because current pulsar data strongly suggest that pulsar magnetic fields do not decay in 20  myr .",
    "a number of interesting questions remains .",
    "the phase diagram of interacting multiple component superconducting species in rotation remains unclear .",
    "it is also interesting to study the effects of alignment torque on magnetic and rotational history of a strange star , and the possible collapse of the nuclear matter crust due to magnetic stress .",
    "i plan to report them in my future works .",
    "i would like to thank mal ruderman for bringing up this problem to my attention and k. y. ding for providing us her field decay program for neutron stars for reference .",
    "i would also like to thank h .-",
    "lo , geoff ravenhall and frank wilczek for their useful discussions .",
    "the hospitality of aspen center for physics is acknowledged where the early part of this work was performed in the summer of 1995 .",
    "this work is supported by doe grant de - fg02 - 90er40542 .",
    "we prove the following claim by explicitly construct a solution to the problem . for simplicity , we shall drop all the star superscripts over the masses and charges .",
    "_ claim : _ suppose there is a finite number of superconducting species .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ e : strong_limit ] ) has a solution with @xmath98 ( and hence it has infinitely many solutions ) if and only if there exist two vectors @xmath275 and @xmath276 among the @xmath277 together with two rational numbers @xmath278 , @xmath279 such that @xmath280 , with @xmath281 being linear dependent over the set of all rational numbers @xmath282 for all @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , @xmath283 are rational numbers for all @xmath54 , and @xmath284 .    _",
    "proof : _ ( @xmath285 ) by replacing vectors @xmath286 by @xmath287 ( @xmath288 ) where @xmath289 is the least common multiple of the denominators of @xmath283 , then @xmath290 will be replaced by @xmath291 . in addition , we can replace @xmath292 by @xmath293 where @xmath112 is the least common multiple of the denominators of @xmath292 and @xmath283 .",
    "then it is easy to verify that @xmath293 and @xmath294 are all integers .",
    "thus , we can always assume that @xmath278 , @xmath279 and @xmath295 to be integers instead of rational numbers .",
    "suppose @xmath296 and @xmath297 are linear dependent on each other , then clearly the ratio of @xmath298 to @xmath299 are the same for all @xmath54 .",
    "so , by choosing @xmath300 for all @xmath54 , @xmath301 , and @xmath302 , eq .",
    "( [ e : strong_limit ] ) is satisfied .",
    "now , we consider the more interesting case when @xmath296 and @xmath297 are linear independent vectors .",
    "consider the equation @xmath303 the linear independence of @xmath296 and @xmath297 implies that @xmath304 , and the solution of the above equation is given by @xmath305 clearly , by choosing @xmath306 and @xmath307 , we can check that the @xmath99 given by eq .",
    "( [ e : a_2 ] ) is non - zero .    now for each @xmath54 , it is easy to check that by choosing @xmath308 ( which is an integer , and this is possible because @xmath309 is linear dependent over @xmath282 ) together with @xmath310 , @xmath90 given in eq .",
    "( [ e : a_2 ] ) , then eq .  ( [ e : strong_limit ] ) is satisfied .",
    "( clearly , if @xmath88 , @xmath99 , @xmath90 is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ e : strong_limit ] ) , then so is @xmath311 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 for any non - zero integer @xmath112 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ e : strong_limit ] ) has either no solution , or infinitely many solutions . )",
    "@xmath314    ( @xmath315 ) on the contrary , suppose that for any linear independent vectors @xmath296 and @xmath297 chosen among @xmath277 , and any rational numbers @xmath278 and @xmath279 , we can find an @xmath54 such that @xmath316 with either ( 1 ) @xmath317 being linear independent over @xmath282 ; or ( 2 ) @xmath283 is irrational ; or ( 3 ) @xmath318 .",
    "now we analyze these three cases one by one :    case  ( 1 ) : if @xmath309 is linear independent over @xmath282 , then from eq .",
    "( [ e : a_1 ] ) , we know that @xmath319 .",
    "in order that @xmath320 and @xmath88 are all integers , the only possibility is @xmath321 .",
    "however , from eq .",
    "( [ e : a_2 ] ) , this implies @xmath322 and hence eq .",
    "( [ e : strong_limit ] ) has no solution for @xmath323 .",
    "case  ( 2 ) : if @xmath283 is irrational , then similar to the argument in case  ( 1 ) , @xmath324 is not an integer .",
    "hence , this choice of @xmath278 and @xmath279 does not produce a solution for eq .",
    "( [ e : strong_limit ] ) .",
    "the above claim implies that there is , in general , no solution to the strongly interacting limit when the number of different species of superconducting cooper pairs is greater than or equal to three .",
    "on the other hand , solution of eq .",
    "( [ e : strong_limit ] ) always exists when there are only two species of cooper pairs , as in the case of strange matter .",
