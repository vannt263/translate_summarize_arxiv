    "singular surfaces , in the sense of @xcite , can be of two types : @xmath2 _ boundary surfaces _ or _ shock waves _ , which entail a discontinuity for the stress - energy tensor ; and @xmath3 _ surface layers _ or _ thin shells _ , which entail a distributional stress - energy tensor that represents a concentrated source for the field equations .",
    "they are useful to construct models for a number of concrete astrophysical and cosmological situations ( @xcite , @xcite ) where shock surfaces form , or where , as a valid simplifying assumption , some part of the system can be thought of as a surface layer .",
    "shocks , in particular , are frequently needed to represent interfaces between different matter models , or different _ phases _ of matter . on the other hand , thin shells proved to be a very useful tool for constructing toy - models to gain insight into general theoretical problems in general relativity , like the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is a relevant family of models in which a zero - thickness configuration is not necessarily a simplifying assumption , and may be interpreted as a fundamental hypothesis .",
    "inspired by string theory , certain cosmological models that consider the visible universe as a part of a singular 4-dimensional surface ( thin shell ) embedded in a higher - dimensional space - time appeared ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they are phenomenological models that can account for the `` invisibility '' of extra dimensions , and constitute a framework where the holographic principle can be naturally understood @xcite . besides being a theoretical possibility that is worth exploring ,",
    "brane - world models have been proven to have interesting properties , such a friedmann - like evolution equations that exhibit an inflationary stage .    in this way",
    ", we consider that an analysis of general properties of thin shell solutions is important and may have relevant astrophysical and cosmological implications .",
    "as mentioned , for most astrophysical applications , a thin shell constitutes an idealization of an ultimately thick configuration .",
    "therefore , it is relevant to ask whether there actually are _ smooth _ configurations whose evolution in spacetime is somehow `` close '' to a given thin shell solution , as it would be expected if thin shells were to be considered representative idealizations . related to this , the following question is also relevant : are thin shells solutions _ stable _ ?",
    "in other words : would an arbitrary configuration that is initially somehow `` close '' to a given thin shell solution , either smooth or non - smooth , remain `` close '' throughout its evolution ? in a previous work @xcite , it has been shown that , for certain families of thin shells made of collisionless particles , there are configurations that are identical to a given thin shell solution up to a point where they start evolving in totally different manner .",
    "the mechanism to construct these configurations is to infinitesimally separate non - interacting constituents of the `` original '' thin shell and then solve the evolution equations of the resulting spacetime .",
    "two kinds of `` fragmentations '' have been then considered : separation of the particle ensemble into two `` non - zero - measure '' groups and _ evaporation _ of individual particles .",
    "it was then said that these families of thin shells , while being well - defined solutions of einstein equations of weak regularity , result unstable against a possible infinitesimal separation of constituents . furthermore , these constructions illustrate the lack of uniqueness in the evolution of unstable ( in this sense ) thin shell solutions .",
    "because of the well - posedness of the einstein - vlasov system , the evolution of a smooth configuration initially close in some sense to a thin shell solution is unique and it should be well - defined at least in a neighborhood of an initial data cauchy surface . indeed , in spherical symmetry , as long as there is vacuum in a neighborhood of the ( regular ) symmetry center ( as would be the case for a smooth solution eventually close to any non - collapsing thin shell solutions ) , global existence can be asserted @xcite . in this way , this instability result suggest the absence of smooth solutions that remain close to these unstable families throughout the evolution .",
    "we may then regard them as _ artificial _ as they can not properly represent realistic non - zero - thickness configurations .",
    "on the other hand , in another work @xcite , and in the appendix of @xcite , it has been shown that there exist some well - defined thin - to - thick shell limits for certain configurations of collisionless particles .",
    "in all the cases considered ( with the shortcoming of being static solutions ) the limiting thin configurations turn out to be _ stable _ in the above sense .",
    "this results suggest that every _ representative _ thin shell solution ( a thin shell that is a limit of a family of thick configurations ) should be stable against separation of constituents .    in newtonian terms ,",
    "a dynamic thin shell made of collisionless particles is possible because they as a whole generate a potential well that prevents them to leave the surface , and makes them move `` together '' . instead of non - interacting but self - gravitating particles",
    ", we could have more general _ phases _ of matter that do not interact directly but through the spacetime curvature they generate , in such a way that they consequently move within a `` narrow '' region of spacetime . in particular , a brane - world can be understood as a construction of this kind , where the entire matter - energy content of the visible universe results _ gravitationally confined _ to a thin shell .",
    "this work is an extension of the ideas implemented in @xcite for collisionless matter in a spherically symmetric and @xmath4-dimensional spacetimes to other more general scenarios .",
    "we want to investigate whether thin shells made of a number of non - interacting constituents entail instability , and hence non - uniqueness in the evolution , by constructing well - defined spacetimes where a single thin shell splits into a number of sub - shells , each one made of one the original constituents , in a differentiable manner .",
    "this work first deals with spherical symmetry in @xmath0-dimensions in order to extend these constructions to the realm of higher - dimensional gravity .",
    "then we particularly focus on brane - cosmology scenarios , where this kind of splitting turns out to be possible ( if not necessary in some sense ) and could be associated with novel phenomenology .",
    "we begin with a description of a general shell in a spherically symmetric bulk spacetime of an arbitrary number of dimensions in section [ sphericalshells ] . in section [ sphericalmotion ]",
    "we analyze some aspects of the dynamics of these shells , provided their matter - energy content satisfy the dominant energy condition . in section [ 2splitting ]",
    "we develop the stability analysis against separation of non - interacting constituents and find a stability condition for general constituents , and then construct some examples of splitting solutions in section [ splittingshells ] . in section [ 3splitting ] , we analyze a splitting scenario that preserves @xmath5 symmetry in which a three component shell ( with two of its constituents being identical ) splits into three shells .",
    "then in section [ splittingbranes ] we extend both kind of instabilities to non-@xmath5-symmetric and @xmath5-symmetric brane - world models respectively .",
    "finally , in section [ final ] we comment on possible interpretations of these features in the context of the general initial value problem with concentrated sources .",
    "we formulate the following conjecture : _ unstable hypersurfaces are not thin - shell limits of thick configurations . _",
    "we begin with a description of a singular shell embedded in a spherically symmetric vacuum spacetime of an arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "the idea of spherical symmetry is originally defined for @xmath7-dimensional riemannian manifolds : there is a group of isometries isomorphic to the @xmath8 group . for lorentzian manifolds ,",
    "we say that there exists a spacelike foliation such that every riemannian slice is spherically symmetric and the lapse and shift are invariant against the action of the group . charting the space of group orbits with orthogonal coordinates @xmath9 , which is always possible , we may write    @xmath10    we have a singular timelike orientable hypersurface @xmath11 embedded in the bulk spacetime . because of the symmetry , the surface should be described by an equation @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , in gaussian coordinates , in a neighborhood of @xmath11 the metric reads , @xmath13 where @xmath14 characterizes the surface , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the shell proper time ) .",
    "einstein equations imply junction conditions on the surface @xcite that relate the jump of the surface extrinsic curvature with the effective mass - energy tensor on the shell .",
    "these are the so - called israel - darmois junction conditions .",
    "the extrinsic curvature in gaussian coordinates reads , @xmath17\\ ] ] where , and from now on , latin indexes represent coordinates @xmath18 on the shell . in these",
    "coordinates the intrinsic metric takes the form , @xmath19 where @xmath20 .    by virtue of birkhoff theorem , vacuum solutions of einstein equations",
    "can always be written in the form , @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a parameter equivalent to the misner - sharp mass inside the _ innermost _ group orbit . from now on , we assume @xmath24 , unless otherwise stated , since we are not interested in collapsing situations . with these expressions ,",
    "we can write the extrinsic curvature on a given _ side _ of the shell in terms of @xmath25 and the parameter @xmath23 that characterizes the bulk spacetime there @xmath26.\\ ] ] in this way , giving @xmath23 and specifying whether @xmath1 increases or decreases with @xmath27 , we get an expression for the extrinsic curvature in terms of the _ intrinsic _ function @xmath25 .    on the other hand , the matter content of the shell",
    "is typically described by a tensor @xmath28 defined on @xmath11 such that we can formally write the @xmath0-dimensional stress - energy tensor as , @xmath29 where the @xmath30 tensor in shell coordinates takes the form @xmath31.\\ ] ] so , as a result of the symmetry imposed , we can describe the matter content of the shell as if it were composed of an @xmath32-dimensional perfect fluid , whose flow lines follow the trajectories of the comoving observers .",
    "explicitly , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the intrinsic metric defined in ( [ intrinsic ] ) , and @xmath35 . if there is not hysteresis , we should be able to write @xmath36 and @xmath37 as functions of @xmath38 . in that case ,",
    "conservation of the source would read @xmath39 this equation together with an equation of state @xmath40 , provided it exists , determine @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "now we can see that israel - darmois junction conditions should relate @xmath25 , it first two derivatives , and the parameters @xmath23 with the matter functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "concentrated matter on the shell implies the _ discontinuity _ of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "looking at ( [ extrinsic2 ] ) , we realize that the jump should be ascribed to a difference between the mass parameters for the empty regions at both sides of the shell , which we call @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and , eventually , to different signs for @xmath45 at both sides . in this paper",
    "we consider situations where at least one of the two schwarzschild regions , say region @xmath46 , is _ interior _ , that is , it can be described by an inequality @xmath47 in terms of the standard coordinates for that region .",
    "the reason for this choice , which only precludes the case where both regions are _ exterior _ , will become clear when we analyze the junction conditions . from now on ,",
    "we choose the @xmath27 coordinate to decrease when going into region @xmath46 , which implies @xmath48 .",
    "the junction conditions then read ,    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the situation not considered by these expressions , the case where @xmath46 and @xmath52 are both _ exterior _ regions , is not generally regarded as _ physical _ because it would imply a _ negative energy density _ @xmath36 . in the context of brane cosmology , however , a _ brane tension _ is assumed , which implies an effective constant energy density on the shell that could in principle be negative , as it is a non - dynamical entity .",
    "but , if that were the case , we would not recover standard cosmology as a low energy ( at least since nucleosynthesis ) limit .",
    "so even in those speculative scenarios a negative energy density type of matter - energy is hard to justify phenomenologically .",
    "in this way , we will only consider matter that satisfies the dominant energy condition , which is a prescription that includes an eventual positive brane tension .",
    "in particular , in the case of a _ exterior _",
    "region @xmath52 , a positive effective energy density @xmath36 would imply @xmath53 . from ( [ israelndima ] )",
    "we can obtain an equation of motion that results independent of the sign @xmath54 and reads @xmath55 but , in obtainig this equation , we have squared some quantities , so it may contain spurious solutions , that is , there could be solutions of ( [ eqnmotion1 ] ) which are not solutions of ( [ israelndima ] ) with a definite sign for @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that every solution of ( [ eqnmotion1 ] ) is always a solution of one of the two versions of ( [ israelndima ] ) ( with a specific choice for @xmath54 ) .",
    "therefore , we can construct solutions of the junction conditions by solving ( [ eqnmotion1 ] ) and specifying _ a posteriori _",
    "@xmath56 accordingly . for a given solution of the equation of motion , @xmath25 ,",
    "the specification that we should made is the following @xmath57 it can be shown that this specification is consistent , because the roots of @xmath58 are always in _ forbidden regions _ ( @xmath59 ) or inside an event horizon @xmath60 . in this way , for a given initial configuration of the shell ( for an arbitrary choice of parameters @xmath61 ) , we can tell whether region @xmath52 should be _ interior _ , or _",
    "exterior _ , in order to satisfy the junction conditions , and that specification turns out to be consistent throughout the evolution .",
    "coordinate becomes timelike , spacetime is not static , and the signature of @xmath45 may change without contradiction with birkhoff s theorem . ]",
    "now it is clear that giving a function @xmath41 ( something that we can find for example imposing an equation of state ) and the parameters ( @xmath43,@xmath44 ) , we have a complete description of the possible motions of the shell by solving an equation of motion for a single particle moving in a given potential .    on the other hand , equation ( [ israelndimb ] )",
    "implies , @xmath62\\ ] ] where @xmath63 .",
    "this expression will be useful later on .",
    "in this section we analyze general properties of the dynamics of the shell geometry , provided the matter content satisfies an energy condition . in particular , we analyze the dynamics for some matter - energy models of interest : fluids with equation of state @xmath64 and vlasov matter .    looking at the effective potential ( [ eqnmotion1 ] ) , we see that the allowed regions for the function @xmath25 are those in which @xmath65 .",
    "the structure of these regions depends on the behavior of the function @xmath41 , so we have to specify the matter model and its parameters in order to describe possible motions",
    ". the condition @xmath65 can be explicitly written , @xmath66 where it is clear that for @xmath38 small enough , this inequality is always satisfied , so there are always `` collapsing '' solutions for the equation of motion ( [ eqnmotion1 ] ) provided @xmath67 is small enough . the asymptotic behavior of the potential when @xmath68 depends on the matter model as follows .",
    "if we suppose that matter satisfies _ the dominant energy condition _ , that is @xmath69 , then equation ( [ conservation ] ) implies    @xmath70    so , giving an initial value @xmath71 , we have for @xmath72 @xmath73    considering the function @xmath74 , the dominant energy condition then implies @xmath75 .",
    "we assume @xmath76 and that @xmath77 has a limit @xmath78 when @xmath38 goes to infinity , which implies that @xmath36 acquires the asymptotic form @xmath79 . according to ( [ espureo ] )",
    ", we can see that if @xmath80 , for @xmath38 large enough , region @xmath52 would be _ exterior _ , and if @xmath81 then it would be _ interior_. in the particular case @xmath82 , region @xmath52 character would be determined by the sign of @xmath83",
    ". the asymptotic behavior of @xmath84 in the limit @xmath68 can be classified as follows ( in all these cases @xmath85 stands for different constants that depend on the parameters ) .",
    "* @xmath86 + then @xmath87 . in this case",
    "@xmath25 is unbounded , provided @xmath67 is large enough . *",
    "@xmath88 + then @xmath89 . the condition for having an unbounded @xmath25 solution is an inequality involving the model parameters .",
    "* @xmath90 + then @xmath91 . there is always an upper bound for @xmath25 . * @xmath92 + then @xmath93 once again the condition for having an unbounded @xmath25 is an inequality involving the model parameters .",
    "* @xmath94 + then @xmath95 . there are always unbounded solutions .",
    "now it is clear that not for every matter model there exist unbounded solutions , so the limit @xmath96 not always makes sense .",
    "anyway , this limit , provided it exists , is important because of the fact that for large @xmath38 we may find newtonian or low - energy limits for the dynamics of the shell .",
    "for example in the context of brane - world cosmologies we hope to recover the standard friedmann equations for @xmath38 large in some sense . on the other hand",
    ", the existence of unbounded solutions will be useful to construct `` unstable - against - separation '' solutions , as we will see in the next sections .",
    "it will also be useful to stress the fact that if we have @xmath97 non - interacting matter fields ( so we can write @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) , each with its own conservation equation and its corresponding @xmath100 , then @xmath101 . in the next subsections",
    "we analyze some characteristics of @xmath84 for specific matter models .",
    "equation ( [ conservation ] ) implies for this family of matter models @xmath102 in this case @xmath84 can be written @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "the dominant energy condition then implies @xmath105 , and we have @xmath106 .",
    "the character of region @xmath52 should be determined by the sign of the expression @xmath107 we can see that this expression is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath38 for @xmath108 , a constant for @xmath109 , and a monotonically decreasing function for @xmath110 . in this way , for large @xmath38 ,",
    "in the first case region @xmath52 should be exterior , and interior in the latter case .",
    "we now comment on some specific and relevant cases .    * @xmath111 represents a `` cosmological constant fluid '' or brane tension .",
    "we have @xmath112 , and there are always unbounded @xmath25 solutions . for these unbounded solutions ,",
    "region @xmath52 must be an _ interior _ schwarzschild region . for certain parameters @xmath113",
    "there are no forbidden regions .",
    "* @xmath114 represents dust , may be the simplest matter model of all .",
    "we have @xmath115 , and the condition for having unbounded @xmath25 is now @xmath116 , otherwise we would have an upper bound .",
    "region @xmath52 must be an _ exterior _ schwarzschild region for the unbounded solutions .",
    "@xmath84 results a monotonically increasing function , so there could be at most one turning point , and if the parameters allow unbounded solutions , then there are no forbidden regions .",
    "* @xmath117 represents a radiation shell .",
    "we have @xmath118 , and there are always unbounded solutions . for these unbounded solutions ,",
    "region @xmath52 must be _",
    "exterior_. also in this case , for certain parameters there are no forbidden regions .",
    "another simple and relevant matter model used for many astrophysical situations is vlasov matter @xcite .",
    "it has the advantage that its range of applicability is phenomenologically clear : a gravitating system can be thought of as an einstein - vlasov system whenever it is composed of many constituents with low collision probability .",
    "it is defined as an ensemble of self - gravitating collisionless particles that interact with each other only by means of the curvature that they generate as a whole . in particular , the particles follow geodesic trajectories . in this context",
    ", we have to specify what do we mean by `` geodesic '' because of the discontinuity of the metric connection on the shell .",
    "furthermore , the curves contained within the shell can not be in general geodesics of neither connection ( see @xcite and @xcite for a discussion in the context of brane cosmology ) .",
    "the alternative we have is to impose that _ the particles follow geodesics of the induced metric _ , something that sounds reasonable , specially taking into account that in this symmetry such geodesics are simply the trajectories of conserved angular momentum within the shell .",
    "the system we are considering in this subsection is a @xmath0-dimensional generalization of the four - dimensional case analyzed in @xcite .",
    "if all particles are identical , the @xmath30 tensor and the particle density current can be written , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the distribution of the number of particles in the tangent bundle and @xmath121 is the particles proper mass . considering the symmetry and the conservation of the distribution of the number of particles with angular momentum modulus @xmath122 ( which we call @xmath123 ) , it can be shown that the independent components of the @xmath30 tensor take the form , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the area of a @xmath32-sphere of unit radius .",
    "now we define , @xmath126 so the equation of motion for this shell can be written , @xmath127 where @xmath128 .    supposing that the function @xmath123 has compact support , then we have @xmath92 , and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath84 would be @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the mean angular momentum modulus .",
    "we see that _ the shell can have unbounded motion if and only if @xmath131_. considering derivatives of ( [ eqnmotionv ] ) , it can be shown in particular that _ we can have oscillating or static solutions only if @xmath132 _ , which is the case analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it can also be shown that ( [ espureo ] ) implies that region @xmath52 must be an _ exterior _ schwarzschild region for both the unbounded and the oscillating solutions .",
    "we now consider a shell composed of two non - interacting matter fields .",
    "we impose that both matter fields are spherically symmetric , so their flow lines go with the comoving observers within the shell and they can be characterized as @xmath32-dimensional perfect fluids . the idea is to consider an infinitesimal separation of the components at a given proper time @xmath133 and calculate the relative acceleration of the separating shells .",
    "the resulting spacetime , once both components are infinitesimally separated , can be determined merely by imposing continuity of @xmath134 and its first derivative , which is equivalent to imposing smoothness ( each `` branch '' should be an embedded submanifold ) in the geometry of each `` splitting '' component , and also equivalent to imposing continuity of normal vectors at the separation point .",
    "the stress - energy tensor takes the form , @xmath135 conservation of the source holds separately for each component , @xmath136 so we have in principle functions @xmath137 and @xmath138 for each component which are characteristic of the matter models .",
    "we should solve the equation of motion for the composed stress - energy tensor ( [ twocomponent ] ) and then for each component separately , taking into account the geometry that the new configuration would have , as illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "_ if the resulting relative acceleration turns out to have the same sign as the relative displacement , then the shell is unstable , otherwise it should be considered as stable_.    in this section we prove that certain families of shells , that are solutions of einstein equations , are unstable against this kind of separation , while other families are stable .",
    "what will remain to be proven is whether there are solutions that are initially stable and evolve as a single shell up to a point where they _ become _ unstable and consequently could _ undergo _ splitting . in the next section",
    "we prove by giving examples that such situations are possible , and splitting shells that are formally solutions of einstein equations can be constructed .    the keys to analyze the relative acceleration of the resulting single - component shells are equation ( [ accel1 ] ) and birkhoff s theorem .",
    "the spacetime region that would appear between the splitting shells is characterized by a mass parameter @xmath139 .",
    "we label with the index 2 ( @xmath140,@xmath141 ) the splitting shell that moves _ into _ region @xmath52 .",
    "the equation of motion for the shell labeled with the index @xmath142 is obtained by replacing @xmath143 in ( [ eqnmotion1 ] ) with @xmath144 ; and for the shell labeled with the index @xmath145 by replacing those quantities with @xmath146 .",
    "continuity of @xmath147 determines @xmath139 as a function of @xmath148 and the matter model parameters .",
    "[ splitting2 ]     in each region .",
    "we distinguish the three possible sets of orientations ( which we call @xmath85 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) compatible with the positivity of @xmath151 and @xmath140.,height=302 ]    looking at ( [ israelndima ] ) , it can be seen that positivity of @xmath151 and @xmath140 implies that @xmath139 should be greater than at least one of the given mass parameters .",
    "in particular , it implies that if region @xmath52 is _ exterior _ , then @xmath152 , and @xmath153 in the intermediate region should point to region @xmath52 ( we label this possibility for the orientations with the @xmath85 letter ) . in the same way , if region @xmath52 is _ interior _ , then @xmath154 , and both orientations for @xmath153 in the intermediate region are possible ( we call @xmath149 the case where @xmath153 points to @xmath52 , and @xmath150 the case where it points to @xmath46 ) . in the latter case , in order to characterize the intermediate spacetime , we must resort to the consistency condition ( [ espureo ] ) applied to one of the resulting shells .",
    "it can be shown that in any case the consistency conditions ( [ espureo ] ) applied for each splitting shell are indeed consistent with each other ( in a given splitting scenario , @xmath139 and @xmath153 in the intermediate region are always well - defined ) .",

    ". a natural choice in a splitting scenario would be the standard time coordinate of the schwarzschild intermediate region @xmath160 . to compute those derivatives we consider the following .",
    "for a general schwarzschild spacetime that has a shell as a boundary , and whose related variables and coefficients we note by a tilde , we can write ,    @xmath161    where @xmath16 is the proper time coordinate of the boundary surface , @xmath38 its radius , and @xmath162 .",

    "that would mean that if the matter content of a shell satisfies the latter inequality and it makes sense to separate the stress - energy tensor into two non - interacting equal - alpha parts , then such a shell would always be unstable .",

    "we end this section with the remark that the critical point for any of the stability conditions ( [ 2braneins],[3braneins ] ) takes place at very early stages of the universe , long before nucleosynthesis . in this way",
    ", the brane results unstable during almost its entire evolution , and becomes increasingly unstable as time passes . a `` soft '' splitting , like those illustrated in section [ splittingshells ] , where @xmath197 is continuous , can only take place at the critical point of the stability condition , so it could only happen in the inflationary era ( taking into account experimental bounds on the brane tension based on deviations of newtonian gravitation at submillimeter scales @xcite ) , or even before .",
    "we may speculate in further investigations the phenomenological consequences of having this kind of splitting in the context of the very early universe .",
    "as far as we know , this particular kind of phenomena in the context of brane - world cosmologies was not specifically considered in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , more general scenarios have been studied in relation with brane - world collisions .",
    "langlois , maeda and wands considered in @xcite an arbitrary number of intersecting hypersurfaces where the common intersection is a codimension @xmath145 manifold , and obtained a _ conservation law _ that is merely a consistency requirement for the whole construction .",
    "moreover , gravanis and willison @xcite considered general networks of singular hypersurfaces in lovelock gravity , developed a formalism to define connections on this spacetime , and obtained selection rules for collisions provided the matter - energy satisfies an energy condition .",
    "our constructions can be thought of as some of the simplest cases among these networks of thin shells , with the further restriction of _ differentiability _ at the so - called _ collision event_. anyway , the physical motivation in this work is completely different ( or much more specific ) from the analysis of brane collisions , and it is precisely this motivation what requires the `` extra '' differentiability assumption : we interpret the `` collision event '' as a _ perturbation _",
    ", so it should be as innocuous as possible , and particularly can be merely thought of as a spontaneous infinitesimal separation of non - interacting constituents .",
    "on the other hand , if we understand splitting processes as matter - energy leaving a brane ( we could define _ the brane _ as the shell in which the brane tension lives ) , we should take into account that there might be reasons coming from string theory to _ a priori _ preclude any chance of having matter moving off into the bulk , as one may consider branes as fundamental objects by themselves , which appear in the definition of the action that describes the theory one is seeking to build .",
    "we may consider branes as objects _ a priori _ defined in some sense . indeed ,",
    "the networks of intersecting hypersurfaces in @xcite are interpreted in this sense , so there is no discussion regarding the _ evolution _ of the topology of the network : it is already _ given _ and the theory itself accommodates to it .",
    "we then basically affirm that the brane - world models considered in this work , in the framework of general relativity defined on the entire _ bulk _ spacetime without any _ a priori _ `` special '' object , are unstable , or at least they entail non - uniqueness in the evolution , and the existence of those features may be an argument against the plausibility of these systems , and of certain families of thin shell models in general .    in the particular case of vlasov matter , the stability against separation of components is probably related to the confinement of test particles in the thin shell , as it happens in the case of a 4-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime @xcite . in section 5 of that reference ,",
    "the stability against single particle evaporation was considered .",
    "it was then concluded that for two - component vlasov shells ( like the one described in the second example of section [ splittingshells ] ) _ the stability condition for separation of components is always stronger than the stability condition for single particle evaporation_. we may conjecture that for vlasov matter the confinement of particles is a necessary condition for stability against separation of components .",
    "furthermore , the particle evaporation analysis may be relevant on its own , as the concept of `` particle '' in the cosmological context may have more sense physically than the concept of `` non - interacting - component '' .",
    "particles in the universe , both if they are dark or baryonic matter , may follow geodesics to a good approximation ( as long as collisions can be neglected ) .",
    "but , as anderson and tavakol analyzed in @xcite and we pointed out in @xcite , _ geodesics of the induced metric do not generally coincide with geodesics of the bulk metric_. indeed , the geodesics of the bulk metric on the brane are not uniquely defined because of the discontinuity of the affine connection : for a given initial point on the singular surface and a given initial tangent velocity there might be two geodesics ( each one going into opposed bulk regions ) , a single geodesic , or no geodesic at all .",
    "we consider that , for a given initial data of the geodesic equation contained in the support of the particle distribution function , _ if there exist a bulk geodesic and there are no non - gravitational forces acting on the particle ensemble , then the particle flow should follow that geodesic_. if we had two different geodesics corresponding to the same initial data for the geodesic equation , we may also interpret this as an instability , as an _ infinitesimal displacement _ of the corresponding test particle into any of the two bulk regions would suffice to have it moving off the surface symmetric models by imposing an `` average '' of both connections ( extrinsic curvatures ) on the brane .",
    "we find it a rather _ ad hoc _ assumption because of the non - linearity of einstein equations . ] .",
    "gravitational confinement is then related to the non - existence of bulk geodesics for observers on the brane , as this non - existence would mean that according to the connection of region @xmath52 a freely falling observer should go into region @xmath46 and viceversa . as analyzed in @xcite , the confinement of freely - falling observers to domain walls in @xmath5-symmetric models can be accomplished if and only if the matter content of the shell satisfy a version of the strong energy condition , which is a condition that models with brane tension generally do not satisfy , so it is not surprising that the brane - world scenarios considered here turn out to be unstable against separation of components .    on the other hand",
    ", we could also interpret the instability results as evidence for the existence of some mechanism that would `` prevent '' the splitting , that is , some interaction between the constituents and a external field , or among the constituents themselves , that may compensate the instability .",
    "we may take into account for example a scalar field on the bulk , which is a widely considered scenario as it may naturally exhibit an inflationary stage and it is easily incorporated by string theoretical considerations .",
    "another possibility is to consider lovelock gravity for the bulk .",
    "these are possible future research directions , and it may happen that some brane - world scenarios turn out to be stable in this sense , in such a way that the stability against separation of constituents could work as an argument in favor of some of them . as a first step ,",
    "as we suggested , we may look into brane - world models that naturally incorporate particle confinement .",
    "another interesting issue related to the splitting solutions is the _ lack of uniqueness _ in the evolution of surface layers .",
    "we have seen different situations involving singular hypersurfaces where a splitting solution can be constructed .",
    "but the splitting process is something that we can not see by looking at initial data on cauchy surfaces that intersect the singular surface before the separation point . for every splitting solution that we constructed in this work",
    ", there is also a corresponding non - splitting solution where the shell moves according to an equation of motion , and it may collapse , oscillate or expand always without fragmentation .",
    "the corresponding initial data in one of these cauchy surfaces is exactly the same for the splitting solution as for the non - splitting solution , so the initial value problem for these objects is compromised .",
    "moreover , there are generally an infinite number of splitting solutions corresponding to a given ( non - splitting ) thin shell , as there is freedom in choosing the separation moment ( the time interval of instability ) and sometimes also in choosing the pair of separating non - interacting components .",
    "further , if we consider particle evaporation we could also build solutions where an _ atmosphere _ forms , creating even more possible evolutions .",
    "this may not be surprising taking into account that we are dealing with _ distributional _ initial data . in other contexts involving hyperbolic pde , like ideal fluids in minkowski spacetime , surfaces of discontinuity ( shock - waves ) may form and evolve , and their evolution according to the original pde system may not be unique @xcite .",
    "anyway , there is an external principle ( an entropy law ) that recovers uniqueness . in this context",
    "we may have an analogous situation : one may identify the `` physical '' evolution among the mathematical possibilities by means of some principle arising from the specific physics of the matter - energy content of the thin shell .",
    "after all , the information about the splitting may be exclusively contained in the degrees of freedom associated with the constituents of the singular surface .",
    "a specific treatment of these issues should be considered in a separate paper .    as a final comment ,",
    "looking at the results in @xcite where we showed that certain singular surfaces are indeed thin shell limits of thick configurations , and that all those singular surfaces are stable against separation of constituents , we make the following conjecture : _ unstable shells are not thin shell limits of thick configurations . _",
    "if we consider thin shells as idealizations of ultimately thick configurations , those unstable solutions could be interpreted as bad idealizations of thick configurations , and hence they can only be taken into account if we consider the system to be _ fundamentally thin _ ,",
    "that is , if there is some fundamental principle that simply precludes the possibility of having matter - energy moving off the surface .",
    "an unstable thin shell may be considered as a _ spurious solution _ arising from the loss of information associated with the fact that we neglected a spacial dimension .",
    "a general demonstration of this conjecture constitutes a possible future research direction , and it should be deeply related to the general initial value problem for concentrated sources . in any case , the stability - against - separation analysis that we exposed in this work can be regarded as a novel analysis to be taken into account in order to constrain the plausibility of models involving surface layers .",
    "this work was partly supported by conicet .",
    "i wish to thank reinaldo gleiser for inspiration , insightful ideas , and for reading the whole manuscript .",
    "i also thank robert geroch for illuminating discussions and advice , and oscar reula for useful discussions regarding the initial value problem for shock waves .",
