    "the blocking of emergent flux by the large amount of weak metal lines present in this spectral region ( line blocking ) and its effect over the ionization structure of the stellar atmosphere ( line blanketing ) 3 .   the presence of strong resonant lines ( either in absorption or emission ) 4 .",
    "the presence of a velocity field in the stellar atmosphere    all these effects must be taken into account when comparing the ionizing sed .",
    "depending of the spectral region , the importance of each one of them can be more or less important .",

    "therefore , we can use nebular line ratios involving lines from to successive ions of the same element ( i.e. giving the ionization degree of the nebula ) as constraints of the ionizing stellar seds at various wavelengths .",

    "the output from photoionization models using seds from the various stellar codes are very similar , except for the [ siii]/[sii ] line ratio ( as expected from the comparison of the quantity @xmath0(s@xmath13)/@xmath0(h@xmath3 ) in fig .",
    "4 ) . the observational constraints point towards predictions from the spherical models",
    "; unfortunately , the nebular spectrum of m43 is contaminated by an external nebular emission ( as can be noticed from the behavior of the [ oiii]/h@xmath14 , [ neiii]/h@xmath14 , and [ oiii]/[oii ] line ratios in the outer part of the nebula ) , not allowing to achieve a firm conclusion .",
    "the behavior of these line ratios may be explained by assuming that the nearby o7v star @xmath15oric ( the ionizing source of m42 ; see fig .",
    "1 ) is ionizing the nebular material in front of m43 .",
    "this contamination is clearly noticed when considering lines from o@xmath16 and ne@xmath16 , since these lines are expected to be emitted by m43 itself only in a small region close to the ionizing star ( due to the low temperature of hd37061 ) , but other lines may also be affected .",
    "+    * in this case , photoionization models show that nebular results are very different depending on the considered sed .",
    "it is interesting to see how results presented in fig .",
    "6 ( concerning the nebular ionization degree constraints ) and fig . 4 are related .",
    "note the importance of the ir line ratios in this case ( except for the optical [ oiii]/[oii ] line ratio , it is the only way to test the stellar seds for @xmath17@xmath18430 ) .",

    "we have presented here results using simple dust free constant density spherical models representing the nebular gas , but we are also exploring the effect of considering dust , more complicated nebular gas distributions , and the possible escape of ionizing photons in the models .",
    "it is important to test the effect of these ingredients before proposing conclusions about the ionizing sed predictions .",
