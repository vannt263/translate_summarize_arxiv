    "modeling the spreading of infectious diseases has a long history @xcite .",
    "mathematical models not only deepen the understanding of epidemic dynamics , but also shed light on the control of diseases . in recent years , much attention has been paid to the epidemic control via social relationship adjustment @xcite . as a pioneering work , gross _ et .",
    "_ first proposed a susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model on an adaptive network .",
    "therein the susceptibles break the link with the infected and rewire to another randomly selected susceptible individual @xcite .",
    "this rewiring rule brings in highly complex dynamics ( such as bistability and oscillation ) to the classical sis model .",
    "the rewiring dynamics then opens the avenue on how individualized partnership adjustment alters the epidemic dynamics . on the one hand , besides the sis model , typical epidemic models have almost been investigated including susceptible - infective - recovered - susceptible ( sirs ) model @xcite , susceptible - infective - recovered ( sir ) model @xcite and susceptible - infective - vaccinated ( siv ) model @xcite . on the other hand , more realistic and complex link rewiring rules are proposed . in particular , generalizations of gross _",
    "et al _ s rewiring rule are mainly in two folds : for one thing , after the disconnection of susceptible - infected ( si ) link , the susceptible is assumed to reconnect to a randomly selected member of the population no matter it is susceptible or not @xcite .",
    "for another , the infected is also allowed to switch its partnership from the susceptible to a new randomly selected contact @xcite .",
    "besides the rewiring rule which is dependent on the infection process , the rewiring rule that is independent of the infection process was also investigated @xcite . in spite of different model assumptions , all these models showed that , the infection propagation can be greatly influenced by the dynamical networks .",
    "in particular , the infection can be effectively suppressed by reducing the interaction opportunities between susceptible and infected individuals .    besides the above - mentioned link - rewiring models , another type of adaptive networks is the link - activation - deactivation model @xcite .",
    "it assumes that a link can either be broken or recreated on the basis of the infectious states of the two endpoints of the link . in this model ,",
    "only local information is required , which could be more realistic @xcite .",
    "in particular ,",
    "al . _ proposed an asis model , in which any si link can be broken ( deactivated ) .",
    "after the disconnection of an si link , the two disconnected nodes can be reconnected again once both of them become susceptible ( activated ) @xcite . despite of seemingly differences ,",
    "the link - activation - deactivation dynamics is similar to the rewiring dynamics : on the one hand , guo _ et al _ showed that the asis model ( initiated on complete graphs ) can approximate the link - rewiring model in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the quasi - stationary ( metastable ) fraction of infected individuals can be reduced by increasing the effective breaking rate ( proportional to the ratio of deactivating rate to activating rate ) .",
    "this echoes the results based on the link - rewiring models that the disease can be controlled by reducing the contacts between susceptible and infected individuals .",
    "therefore , both types of the linking dynamics in epidemic control can be seen as decreasing the interaction rate between susceptible and infected individuals ( called _ si control _ ) . furthermore , considering that the effective breaking rate in @xcite also depends on the activating rate between susceptibles , their work reminds us of the significance of ss links in epidemic control .",
    "intuitively , increasing the interaction time between susceptibles can also be a control strategy ( called _ ss control _ ) .",
    "yet it is seldom addressed , compared to the si control that has been intensively studied in previous literatures .",
    "it seems that these two control strategies are the two sides of the same coin .",
    "actually , this is true in gross s model @xcite , since based on their rewiring rule , the decrease of si links directly leads to the increase of ss links .",
    "however , this is no longer valid in risau - gusmn and zanette s model @xcite , since the disconnection of an si link does not necessarily result in the reconnection of an ss link . therefore the ss and si control strategies are not equivalent in general . in this work ,",
    "we provide a comparative study on the si control and the ss control by proposing a novel link - rewiring sis model .",
    "unlike the models only allowing the breaking of si links , we allow all the three types of links ( ss , si and ii ) to be broken , equipped with three independent parameters to characterize the breaking rates of ss , si and ii links .",
    "actually , this assumption mimics the intrinsic nature of human mobility @xcite , namely , people move or change their social relationships due to a variety of reasons , even without the consideration of avoiding infectious diseases . in this way",
    ", si links should not be the only type that is allowed to be broken , both ss and ii links can change .",
    "for example , in * aids * ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome ) not only the susceptibles are willing to avoid contacts from the infectives , but the susceptible - susceptible and infected - infected relationships may also be broken up due to unsatisfactory sexual experiences , _",
    "i.e. _ the rewiring processes can happen in ss and ii links . besides , we allow all the individuals to be capable of adjusting any of their partners .",
    "this mirrors the freedom of social life .",
    "it also excludes the central control of epidemics , for example , that via organizations . in this way",
    ", we could concentrate on how the social partnership adjustment strategies alone alter the fate of epidemics .",
    "we demonstrate analytically that our model captures the epidemic dynamics with non - uniform interaction rates under fast linking dynamics . it is shown that sometimes the ss control is more effective and robust than the si control .",
    "in particular , strengthening the closeness between susceptibles ( ss control ) effectively eradicates the disease no matter how infectious the disease is .",
    "however , the effectiveness of the si control sensitively depends on the infectious intensity and the intrinsic mobility rate of the population . in other words",
    ", there are cases such that the si control can not eliminate the disease so efficient as the ss control .",
    "simulation results are also shown for validating our theoretical predictions .",
    "our findings suggest that , besides the si control , it is still of concern that the ss control may serve as a better candidate for epidemic control .",
    "in this section , we propose the model of epidemic spreading coupled with a simple stochastic link - rewiring dynamics . then we theoretically analyze the epidemic model with non - uniform interaction rates based on the time scale separation .",
    "we consider a structured population of @xmath0 individuals .",
    "the population is located on a connected network .",
    "we assume that the average degree @xmath1 is much smaller than the population size @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath2 . here",
    "nodes refer to individuals and links represent social ties between individuals .",
    "we adopt a standard susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model to study the epidemic spreading .",
    "the sis model assumes that susceptible individuals get infected with a probability proportional to the number of their infected neighbors ; infected individuals recover and become susceptible with no immunity to the disease after a period of recovery time .",
    "the sis model has three features : _ i _ )",
    "the whole population size @xmath0 is constant over time ; _ ii _ ) the transmission of disease only happens via the si links ; _ iii _ ) the recovery of infected individuals is independent of the status of their neighbors .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number of infected individuals at time @xmath4 , therefore , the mean - field equation of the sis model on the structured population is given as follows @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the transmission rate and @xmath7 is the recovery rate . all through the paper",
    "we assume that @xmath8 without loss of generality , and @xmath9 is the number of the si links .",
    "the social relationships between individuals are not eternal , but are continuously co - evolving . as a typical example , susceptible individuals tend to avoid contacts with infected ones by adjusting their local connections .",
    "it has served as the most recognized prototype in the study of epidemic control on dynamical networks .",
    "however , individuals may receive miscellaneous information when making rewiring decisions , thus it is possible for all the individuals to adjust all of their current social relationships .",
    "such a rewiring process captures mobility - like human behavior .",
    "here we propose a simple link - rewiring dynamics by extending the dynamical nature from si links to all types of links in the network .",
    "each individual is either susceptible ( s ) or infected ( i ) .",
    "thus , there are three types of links : susceptible - susceptible ( ss ) , susceptible - infected ( si ) and infected - infected ( ii ) links .",
    "to characterize the fragilities of different types of links , we define @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) as the probability with which an @xmath12 link breaks off in the process of disconnection . in each rewiring step , a link @xmath12 is selected randomly from the network . with probability @xmath10 ,",
    "the link is broken , otherwise the link remains connected .",
    "if it is broken , @xmath13 or @xmath14 is picked as the active individual , who is entitled to reform a new link .",
    "its new neighbor is randomly selected from the individuals who are not in its current neighborhood .",
    "self - connections and double connections are thus not allowed here .    in this way",
    ", the link - rewiring dynamics can be modeled as a markov chain in the state space of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "considering the transition probabilities between states , let us take the transition from @xmath16 to @xmath17 as an example .",
    "this happens only when @xmath16 is broken off and @xmath18 is selected to reform a new link to another susceptible individual .",
    "note that the total population size @xmath0 is much larger than the average degree @xmath1 , the transition probability @xmath19 is approximately given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the density of susceptibles at the moment .",
    "similarly , we calculate all the other transition probabilities , yielding the transition probability matrix @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the density of infected individuals .",
    "according to the standard theory of markov chain @xcite , there exists a unique limiting distribution @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 provided @xmath26 is irreducible and aperiodic .",
    "namely , when @xmath27 , @xmath26 has a unique stationary distribution @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the normalization .      it is challenging to capture @xmath9 due to the complexity of real social networks @xcite",
    "this is already true in static networks , and it becomes even more difficult taking into account the dynamical nature of social networks @xcite .",
    "here we overcome this problem by assuming the adiabatic elimination of fast linking dynamics @xcite ( also called annealed adaptive dynamics @xcite ) , _ i.e. _ the adjustment of social ties is much more frequent than the update of infection states .",
    "this assumption implies _ time scale separation _ of the two coupled dynamics . in other words ,",
    "the disease is unlikely to spread until the social configuration tends to the stationary regime . in this way",
    ", @xmath9 is approximated as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total number of the links in the network and @xmath32 is the fraction of si links in the stationary regime .",
    "this approximation greatly reduces the complexity of the coupled dynamics . in light of this",
    ", the idea of time scale separation has frequently been used in analyzing complex dynamics on adaptive networks ( epidemics @xcite , evolutionary games @xcite ) .    by taking eq .",
    "( [ nsi ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ basicmodel ] ) we have @xmath33 note that @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , eq . can be transformed to @xmath37 in particular , when all the interaction rates are uniform and positive ( @xmath38 ) , eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) reduces to @xmath39 eq .",
    "( [ basicmodel2 ] ) is nothing but the classical sis model @xcite , provided that @xmath40 is redefined as the effective transmission rate .",
    "this implies that the population is as if a well - mixed population , if individuals break their partnerships with no social bias .",
    "it should be pointed out that , when @xmath41 , the transition probability matrix eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) violates the irreducible condition @xcite that our analysis replies on .",
    "in fact , this case resembles the static network , which has been excluded from our analysis .",
    "when the interactions are violated from above social unbias , on the one hand , it results in non - uniform interactions in the population @xcite .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ model ] ) extends the classical sis model from uniform interaction rates to non - uniform interaction rates .",
    "noteworthy , this non - uniform extension is an emergent property from microscopic stochastic linking dynamics , which is not assumed in prior . on the other hand , if we define @xmath42 , our model also extends the classical sis model from density independent transmission rate to density dependent transmission rate @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the dynamical nature of social networks essentially acts as a feedback mechanism on the sis model .",
    "the feedback mechanism , which is taken as the central idea of control , can significantly alter the epidemic dynamics .",
    "noteworthy , all the analysis above are based on the time scale separation .",
    "thus it suggests that the link - rewiring event should happen with a sufficiently large probability ( close to 1 ) in each update .",
    "furthermore , we give a more precise lower bound for this probability based on pair approximations : it is found that the time scale separation is at work provided the likelihood of the linking dynamics is greater than ( see appendix [ a ] ) @xmath43 for more general cases where the time scale separation is absent , higher order approximation method could be applied to provide theoretical insights @xcite ( see appendix [ a ] ) .",
    "our main concern in this comparative study is epidemic control via changing the interaction rates in different ways .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( [ basicmodel ] ) , it is @xmath9 that determines the spread of infection .",
    "the more the si links are , the more likely the spread of infection could be . generally , there are two ways to control @xmath9 . for one thing ,",
    "it is natural to increase @xmath44 for reducing the interaction rate ( @xmath45 ) between susceptible and infected individuals ( _ si control _ ) .",
    "for another thing , decreasing @xmath46 can also reduce the exposure of susceptibles to infection ( _ ss control _ ) .",
    "therefore , we will investigate the control of epidemics via these two strategies . more specifically , by taking the uniform interaction rates ( @xmath38 ) as the reference case , we would like to provide a comparative study on both the si control ( @xmath47 ) and the ss control ( @xmath48 ) . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the effective transmission rate is always larger than the recovery rate , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath49 , where the epidemic control is necessary .",
    "to decrease the interaction rate between susceptibles and infectives , it is equivalent to increase the breaking probability @xmath44 .",
    "based on the uniform interaction as the reference case , we are interested in how the epidemic dynamics is changed by increasing @xmath44 . here",
    "the uniform interaction can mimic the basic migration rate in the population . to illustrate our main results , we consider three typical cases with different initial values of the uniform interaction rates ( see appendix [ tech ] for technical details ) :    _ small initial case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wss = wii]a)_. in this case , we set initially the breaking probabilities for all types of links to be @xmath50",
    ". the disease can be controlled by increasing @xmath44 from 0.05 to 1 .",
    "in particular , for small infectious rate ( _ i.e. _ @xmath51 ) , there is a phase transition with the increase of @xmath44 .",
    "that is , the final state of epidemics turns from endemic to extinction . for large @xmath52 ( _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath53 ) , there is a small region of bistability where the disease persists or die out due to the initial infected fraction .",
    "compared to the single continuous phase transition in the conventional ( uniform ) sis model , the non - uniform sis model can give rise to multiple phase transitions . the emergent bistability in adaptive sis model",
    "has already been reported in previous studies @xcite , but it is quite difficult to approximate the conditions under which bistability is present . for our model , we explicitly provide those analytical conditions under which the bistability emerges based on eq . .",
    "in the case of si control ( @xmath47 ) , it arises if and only if @xmath54 ( see appendix [ tech ] ) where @xmath55 .",
    "_ intermediate initial case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wss = wii]b)_. in this case , increasing @xmath44 is not as effective as that in the above small initial case . for small @xmath52 ,",
    "even though there still exists a phase transition from endemic state to extinct state , the marginal value of @xmath44 that needs to cross the transition line is large .",
    "more importantly , when @xmath52 is large enough , increasing @xmath44 is unable to eradicate the disease any more .",
    "the disease will persist no matter how large the interaction rates between susceptibles and infectives are .",
    "moreover , it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] that , the endemic level is not sensitive to @xmath44 . in other words , by increasing @xmath44 , the final fraction of infectives declines very slowly .",
    "that is to say , the increase of @xmath44 can neither qualitatively change the final state of endemic , nor quantitatively inhibits the final fraction of infectives",
    ".    _ large initial case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wss = wii]c)_. in this case , the endemic state is always the global stable state provided @xmath49 .",
    "that is , the epidemics can not be eradicated by the si control .    to summarize , the control efficiency via reducing the interaction rate between susceptibles and infectives strongly depends on the reference breaking probabilities , _",
    "i.e. _ , the intrinsic population mobility",
    ". the more likely the population is mobile , the worse the si control performs .",
    "unlike the si control , increasing the interaction rate between susceptibles is shown as an effective and robust strategy for epidemic control .",
    "in fact , no matter what the intrinsic mobility rate of the population is , the ss control successfully eradicates the disease . to this end ,",
    "we study the three typical reference population mobility cases in the above subsection ( see appendix [ tech ] for technical details ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : wsi = wii ] shows that the phase diagrams for the three cases are quite similar to each other :    * for small @xmath52 ( @xmath56 ) , by decreasing @xmath46 , the final state of disease is directly transformed from endemic to extinction . * for large @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "the bistablilty arises in all the three cases .",
    "that is , no matter how large the initial uniform interaction rates are , with the decrease of @xmath46 , there is an intermediate region where the disease persists or dies out depending on the initial fraction of disease furthermore , we analytically obtain that the bistable region is given by @xmath57    by comparison , the ss control is more effective than the si control in two ways . on one hand ,",
    "the control of @xmath46 is independent of the intrinsic population mobility , _ i.e. _ , robust control . on the other hand , decreasing @xmath46 can always effectively eradicate the disease regardless of infectious intensity ( fig .",
    "4 illustrates the position of equilibria as a function of @xmath46 in the bistable case ) .",
    "in this section , we present agent - based simulations and further discuss the efficiency of the time scale separation method based on the comparison between the simulation results and theoretical predictions .      the _ contact process _",
    "@xcite is adopted to model the epidemic spreading on networks .",
    "let @xmath58 be the probability of epidemic spreading in each update .",
    "the simulation is performed as following :    1 .   initially , there are @xmath0 individuals located on a regular graph with degree @xmath1 , where each individual has exactly @xmath1 neighbors",
    ". then @xmath59 infectives and @xmath60 susceptibles are randomly distributed .",
    "2 .   generate a random number @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath62 , we perform the contact process . otherwise ( @xmath63 ) , we perform the linking dynamics . 3 .",
    "if the contact process occurs , an infected individual ( called bob ) is selected randomly . with probability @xmath64 bob",
    "becomes susceptible , where @xmath65 is the degree of bob .",
    "otherwise a neighbor of bob s is selected at random .",
    "this neighbor , namely jack , is infected with probability @xmath66 .",
    "noteworthy , jack becomes infected if its status is susceptible .",
    "however , this new infection event does not change the state of jack if jack has been infected already . then return to step 2 .",
    "if the linking dynamics occurs , a link is selected randomly .",
    "the type of this link is denoted as @xmath12 ( @xmath67 ) . with probability @xmath10 ,",
    "the link is broken , otherwise the link remains connected .",
    "if it is broken , @xmath13 or @xmath14 is picked as the active individual , who is entitled to reform a new link .",
    "the new neighbor is randomly selected from the individuals who are not in its current neighborhood . then return to step 2 .",
    "each data point is averaged over @xmath68 independent samples . in each sample , we run a transient time of @xmath69 generations , and we set the mean value over time window of last @xmath70 generations to be the final fraction of infectives .",
    "it should be pointed out that , the simulation results are robust for all initial connected graphs , provided the number of infectives @xmath59 , population size @xmath0 and the average degree @xmath1 are fixed .",
    "the regular graph here only serves as a prototype for simulations .",
    "in fact , our linking dynamics is a markov chain , which is irreducible and aperiodic .",
    "this yields that the limiting behavior is independent of the initial configuration of the network @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of time scale separation allows all the links to converge to the stationary distribution .",
    "therefore , all the links would converge to the stationary distribution no matter what type of graph it is initially .      with the coupled linking dynamics ,",
    "the final fate of the infection can be of three folds : die out no matter what the initial fraction of the infective is ( called _ extinction _ ) ; stabilize at a non - zero fraction of infectives no matter what the ( positive ) initial fraction of infectious individuals is ( called _ endemic _ ) ; stabilize at a non - zero fraction of infectives if the initial fraction of infectious individuals exceeds a critical value and die out otherwise ( called _ bistability _ ) .    for the extinction cases ,",
    "simulation results are found to be in good agreement with the analytical predictions .",
    "this is true for all the parameter regions predicting extinction for both si and ss controls ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : si:1 ] ) .",
    "for the endemic cases , fig .",
    "[ fig : si:3 ] shows that the population would end up with a constant fraction of infected individuals , provided there are infective individuals initially .",
    "this is exactly in line with the analytical predictions .",
    "furthermore , the inconsistency between the analytical and simulation results is less than @xmath71 , which is acceptable . considering this @xmath71 disagreement , the analytical predictions systematically over - estimate the simulation results .",
    "in fact , the agent - based contact process is a markov process with an absorbing state , where no infected individual is present . in other words",
    ", the disease would go extinct eventually if the system evolves sufficiently long .",
    "our analytical results , however , are in the quasi - stationary time scale @xcite .",
    "the inconsistency between the analytical and simulation results suggests that the running time @xmath69 is beyond the quasi - stationary time scale .",
    "thus the system may evolve to the absorbing state with non - negligible chances .",
    "for the bistability cases , the simulation results show qualitative agreement with the analytical predictions . in particular ,",
    "the critical initial fraction of infected individuals , ensuring a dramatic outbreak of epidemics , is consistent with the unstable fixed point predicted by the analytical result ( see the blue dash lines in fig . [",
    "fig : si:2 ] ) .",
    "disagreements , however , are also present . for example , the theoretical results tend to underestimate the final infection when the infection fraction is rare initially .",
    "in fact , this bistable case bears two internal equilibria lying at @xmath72 ( unstable ) and @xmath73 ( stable ) ( @xmath74 ) . for small initial fraction of infectives ,",
    "the deterministic part of the system drives the infection to extinction based on the analytical investigation . yet by its intrinsic stochastic nature of the epidemic spreading , the infection would increase in number and be possibly trapped around the stable equilibria from time to time . even though it is a type of _ rare event",
    "_ , it takes quite long to escape from this trap .",
    "thus on average it results in a relatively higher level of final fraction of infectives given the running time of simulations ( here @xmath69 generations ) .",
    "in other words , it is the interplay between the stochastic effect and stable equilibrium at zero that results in such inconsistency .",
    "noteworthy , despite of this quantitative inconsistency , the salient feature of the bistable dynamics is still captured by the analytical predictions .    in fig",
    "[ fig : si:4 ] , we investigate how the population size affects the accuracy of the analytical approximation .",
    "theoretically , large population size inhibits the stochasticity arising from the finite population effect , which is closer to the mean - field approximation .",
    "similar discussions can be found in @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : si:4 ] shows the case with @xmath75 still captures the bistable dynamics as the case with @xmath76 does .",
    "we have proposed a simple link - rewiring rule to model social partnership adjustment . therein all the links are about to break , capturing the mobility nature of the population .",
    "this simple model paves the way to compare different rewiring - based epidemic control strategies .    instead of focusing on the control strategy via breaking si links ( _ e.g. _ @xcite )",
    ", our model extends the rewiring rule from si links to all the three types ( si , ss and ii ) of links , which facilitates us to compare different rewiring control strategies . we find that , for mild infectious disease , both si and ss control strategies can eradicate the disease . for strong infectious disease , however , it is more efficient to adopt the ss control than the si control .",
    "this result is counterintuitive .",
    "intuitively , reducing the contacts between susceptible and infected individuals is believed to suppress the disease propagation .",
    "moreover , it seems that decreasing the interaction rate of si links could naturally result in the increase of ss links @xcite .",
    "how can these two strategies perform so differently ?",
    "one of the salient features of our model is the variability of ii links , which is seldom addressed previously .",
    "actually , increasing @xmath44 is equivalent to decreasing both @xmath46 and @xmath77 . in other words ,",
    "the si control is equivalent to simultaneously strengthening ss links and ii links .",
    "similarly , the ss control is equivalent to simultaneously reducing the closeness of si links and ii links .",
    "thus , the relation of the si and ss control strategies is not as straightforward as expected . to illustrate the impact of ii links on the epidemic dynamics , we consider two examples : ( 1 ) @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ; ( 2 ) @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath81 .",
    "the only difference between these two examples is the value of @xmath77 .",
    "it is easy to show that in example ( 1 ) disease becomes extinct , whereas bistability arises in example ( 2 ) ( based on eq . ) .",
    "another feature of our reconnection rule is _",
    "nonselective_. in other words , individuals are allowed to rewire to a randomly selected member no matter it is susceptible or not . compared to the _ selective _ rule in @xcite ( rewiring to a randomly selected susceptible ) ,",
    "individuals in our model are not necessary to know who gets infected currently , which is more realistic",
    ". actually , the nonselective rule increases the exposure of the susceptible to the infected .",
    "this is very likely in the beginning of epidemic season , where the information on infection status is unaccessible . in particular , even though the si control increases the breaking possibility of each si link , a new si link may be generated again due to the nonselective rule .",
    "by contrast , the ss control makes a straightforward intervention during the process of disconnection .",
    "that is , by strengthening the closeness between susceptibles , the ss strategy reduces the possibility of si connection effectively . in this way ,",
    "the nonselective rule has a relatively small impact on the ss control .",
    "therefore , in the framework of the nonselective rewiring rule , the ss strategy is more efficient than the si strategy .",
    "concentrating on the relation between the lifespan of each type of links and epidemic spreading , our model does not account for other features that are also considerable in capturing the epidemic dynamics of real world networks .",
    "for example , ( 1 ) our linking dynamics does not take into account the social interactions with memory , such as friendship and working partners , in which individuals preserve the contacts that they used to make @xcite ; ( 2 ) the link - rewiring process is a strong simplification of the real adaptive networked human behavior .",
    "it is not necessarily realistic for individuals who break up a relationship to have a new partner immediately .",
    "however , it probably mimics the dynamics of networks in * aids * to some extent : the susceptible individuals break up their ( mostly sexual ) relationships with their infected partners and switch to other perceived healthy individuals .",
    "moreover , the infected individuals may also rewire their links to other infectives .    to sum up",
    ", our result captures the causation between the link fragility and the disease control .",
    "furthermore , this model might serve as a starting point to compare different rewiring control strategies for more general models closer to reality .",
    "our model couples the linking dynamics and the epidemic dynamics .",
    "while the method in the main text is analytically insightful , it requires the time scales of the two dynamics to be separated . in other words",
    ", individuals should adjust their partners much faster than the spread of epidemics to make this method applicable .",
    "this is , however , not the case in general .",
    "we propose another analytical method to overcome this restriction .",
    "the method is based on pair approximation and rate equations @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on how the method helps us estimate the condition under which the time scale separation is valid .",
    "let @xmath82 and @xmath83 be the global frequencies of infected and susceptible individuals _",

    "the system thus is determined by three independent variables : @xmath82 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the crucial assumption for pair approximation is that higher - order of moments can be captured by moments of pairs . in the following",
