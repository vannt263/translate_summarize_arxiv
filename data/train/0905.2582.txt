    "first , the relative amplitude of the thermal and kinematic contributions depends on model parameters ; the ksz effect could be larger than the tsz effect since the average temperature of the igm is rather low .",
    "second , since the igm is not isothermal , the tsz contribution is dominated by the mildly overdense regions , which subtend smaller angles than the filaments themselves , so its power is shifted to higher @xmath52 . in figures  [ fig1]b ,",
    "c we show the contribution of different redshift intervals to the total power for each of the whim contributions . in both cases ,",
    "the main contribution comes from @xmath11 to @xmath68 .",

    "the expected tsz contribution at _ wmap _ scales is then negligible .",
    "for this reason , we shall consider only a ksz component .",
    "this restriction simplifies our study since the ksz power spectrum depends only on three parameters : @xmath59 , @xmath63 and @xmath45 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ksz_ps ] we plot ksz power spectra for different values of @xmath59 and @xmath63 with @xmath67 .",
    "a regression fit of the variation of the maximum amplitude of the ksz power spectrum with each of these three parameters permits us to write the following scaling relation : @xmath74    while the amplitude depends on the three parameters , the location of the maximum is only weakly dependent on @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath45 is a multiplicative factor that affects only the amplitude but not the shape or position of the maximum , variations on @xmath45 and @xmath59 can not be distinguished .",
    "the ksz effect is then effectively described by two parameters : one cosmological ( @xmath59 ) and one physical ( @xmath63 ) determining the jeans length .",
    "figure  [ fig1]c also shows that most of the contribution comes from very low redshifts .",

    "( [ eq : ampksz ] ) is limited by the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ksz ] ) ; if filaments overlap along the line of sight , it overpredicts the signal .",
    "since the ksz effect is just an integral along the line of sight of all electrons with a coherent peculiar motion , an order of magnitude estimate of the effect is @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the overdensity of a typical filament and @xmath77 is the coherence scale of a motion with amplitude @xmath78 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the distribution of the effect is rather skewed and 9% of all lines of sight will produce an effect 1.86 times larger than the estimate from eq .",

    "( 2008 , 2009 ) reported a bulk flow of amplitude 6001000  km / s on a scale of @xmath81  mpc / h that could give a much larger contribution .",
    "a significant fraction of the temperature decrement of @xmath82k detected in the intercluster medium of the corona borealis supercluster by @xcite could be due to thermal and kinematic sz contributions .",
    "however , that decrement is in a direction almost perpendicular to the bulk flow cited above and , because of its orientation with respect to the line of sight , this flow would not induce a significant ksz contribution in corona borealis .",
    "only a smaller ksz contribution could exist due to peculiar motions on the scale of the supercluster itself .",
    "to explore the parameter space of @xmath0cdm models with and without a ksz contribution , we used the april 2008 version of the cosmomc package @xcite . this software implements an mcmc method that performs parameter estimation using a bayesian approach . when the ksz contribution is included , precomputed @xmath51 are added at each step of the chain to the theoretical power spectrum , computed with camb @xcite for each set of @xmath0cdm cosmological parameters .",
    "the model is compared with the data using the likelihood code supplied by the _",

    "we considered the concordance @xmath0cdm model , defined by a spatially flat universe with cold dark matter ( cdm ) , baryons and a cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "the relative contributions of these components are given in units of the critical density : @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the total matter density .",
    "the specific parameters used in the analysis were the physical densities @xmath1 and @xmath87 where @xmath88  km  s@xmath89  mpc@xmath89 is the normalized hubble constant . in order to minimize degeneracies , instead of @xmath90 we used the angular size of the first acoustic peak @xmath91 , i.e. the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance to last scattering @xcite .",
    "we considered adiabatic initial conditions and assumed an instantaneous reionization parameterized by its optical depth to thomson scattering up to the moment of decoupling @xmath92 .",
    "the initial fluctuation spectrum was parameterized as a power law , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the amplitude at @xmath95  mpc@xmath89 and @xmath96 the spectral index .",
    "since the effect of @xmath45 on the ksz power spectrum is indistinguishable from that of @xmath59 we fix that parameter to a given value .",

    "after a first run , we resampled our grid around the best - fit model . in the intervals",

    "the differences between interpolated and exact power spectra were lower than @xmath109% in the same @xmath52 range .",
    "the ksz power spectrum is obtained at each step of the chain by logarithmic interpolation of the precomputed power spectra in the four closest nodes of this grid .",
    "initially , between two consecutive steps in the chain , we added to each parameter a random increment drawn from a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation equal to the value listed in table  [ tab : param_prior ] multiplied by 2.4 . since we found that @xmath63 was strongly correlated with @xmath1 and @xmath110 , we reran the chains using the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the parameters ( computed with the getdist facility which is part of the cosmomc package ) as distribution widths .",
    "we ran nine independent chains , with a total number of 150000 independent samples , when no ksz is included . with ksz we fixed the baryon fraction in whim at five different values @xmath1110.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 and 0.7 ( we also tried to constrain a model with @xmath45 as a free parameter , but the degeneracies did not allow us to obtain reliable results )",
    "in each case we ran eight independent chains of similar sizes with a total number of samples @xmath112  225000 .",
    "we used the @xmath113 statistic @xcite as a convergence criterion .",
    "all our parameters have @xmath113 well below 1.2 : @xmath114 for @xmath115 and @xmath1161.002 for the other parameters .",
    "in figures  [ fig:1dlikes]a , b , c we plot the mean 1d likelihoods for @xmath63 , @xmath59 and the more informative rms temperature fluctuation introduced by the ksz signal defined as : @xmath117^{1/2}~~. \\label{eq : rms_ksz}\\ ] ] the different lines correspond to different baryon fractions .",
    "since the ksz parameters affect the amplitude of the spectrum most significantly ( see figure  [ fig : ksz_ps ] ) then , for each @xmath45 the maximum 1d likelihood of @xmath63 shifts but the ksz signal remains roughly constant ( see figure  [ fig:1dlikes]c ) .",
    "this high degeneracy indicates that 5 year _ wmap _",

    "@xcite used the amr enzo code @xcite to simulate a ( 512 mpc / h)@xmath151 volume including unbound bas , and found that one - third of the sz flux in a 100 square - degree region comes from objects with masses below @xmath152  m@xmath153 and filamentary structures made up of whim gas , a conclusion similar to that reached by @xcite .",

    "the _ planck _ satellite , with its wider frequency coverage , lower noise and different scanning strategy , is well suited for detecting the igm / whim thermal and kinematic contributions with much higher statistical significance and to distinguishing this signal from other foreground contributions .",
