    "wire medium ( wm ) is an artificial medium formed by a lattice of ideally conducting thin wires .",
    "recently , we have observed a growing interest to such artificial media of possible new physical phenomena and potential applications .",
    "this medium at low frequencies is usually described as a uniaxial crystal , whose permittivity tensor components are expressed by the plasma model .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that if the wavevector in a wm has a nonzero component along the wires , the plasma model should be corrected introducing spatial dispersion ( sd ) . similarly , spatial dispersion is inherent to the double wm ( dwm ) formed by two mutually orthogonal lattices of thin ideally conducting straight wires , see fig .",
    "[ 2dwm ] .    for consideration of waves in double wire media",
    "let us take a case where the wires are perpendicular to each other in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions .",
    "the waves in unbounded space filled with a dwm medium were studied in @xcite numerically , in @xcite using a semi - analytical approximation of the local field , and in @xcite both numerically and using the effective medium ( em ) approach . in the last paper a very good agreement between the results given by the em and full - wave theories for all types of waves in dwm ( if the wires are thin ) has been demonstrated .    in this paper",
    "we consider the plane - wave reflection and refraction at an interface of dwm using the effective medium approach .",
    "we assume that the two orthogonal wire arrays are identical , the period of the lattice is equal to @xmath2 in the @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 directions , and the radius of the wires is equal to @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the wire lattice is square in the plane of the wires , i.e. , the @xmath5 plane .",
    "we assume also that the interface of dwm lies in the @xmath6 plane and the incident wave vector lies in the @xmath5 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ 2dw ] ) .    in the next sections we will give basic expressions , obtained in the framework of the em approach , and formulate the wave refraction problem , demonstrating necessity of additional boundary conditions ( abc s ) both for interface problems with single and double wire media .",
    "then we will discuss some approaches , applying in solid state physics in order to overcome the abc problem and look what may be useful for us in application to wm . using the abc - free approach we will find the reflection coefficient , amplitudes and poynting vectors for refracted waves .",
    "we will compare directions of the group velocity and the energy density flow found from the expression for the poynting vector containing additional terms inherent for media with spatial dispersion .",
    "conservation of the normal component of the power flow vector at passing through the interface is checked .",
    "assuming space - time dependence of fields as @xmath7 , there are non - zero wave vector components parallel to wires .",
    "anisotropy appears in this electromagnetic crystal with square lattice and dwm behaves as a biaxial crystal with the relative permittivity dyadic = = _ x#u_x#u_x+_y#u_y#u_y+ _ z#u_z#u_z , with a5 _ x=_h ,  _",
    "y=_h(1-k_p^2 ) ,  _ z=_h(1-k_p^2 ) ,",
    "where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the speed of light , and @xmath10 is the relative permittivity of the host medium .",
    "note , that model works both for real and imaginary @xmath11 ( for propagating and evanescent waves , respectively ) , see @xcite .    in the wire medium",
    "the maxwell equations # e =- j_o#h # h = j_o=#e split into two separate subsystems describing wave propagation of fields with te and tm polarizations : -j(k_y#u_y+k_z#u_z)(e_x#u_x+e_y#u_y+e_z#u_z)=-j_o ( h_x#u_x + h_y#u_y+h_z#u_z ) -j(k_y#u_y+k_z#u_z)(h_x#u_x+h_y#u_y+h_z#u_z)=j_o ( _ x e_x#u_x + _",
    "ye_y#u_y+_ze_z#u_z ) . for ordinary ( te ) waves",
    "this leads to the wave equation e_x=0 .",
    "the same equations hold for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "there are no effects due to wires , and ordinary waves propagate as in any isotropic dielectric medium .    whereas for extraordinary ( tm ) waves the wires affect the propagation , and we obtain the wave equation u1 [ k^2_y - k_z^2 -k_y^2_y ] h_x=0 .",
    "the same equation can be written for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    in order to solve the wave reflection problem we need to evaluate the eigenwaves which are outgoing from the interface of dwm .",
    "it means that we have to find @xmath16 under fixed @xmath17 and @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the incidence angle .",
    "it follows from that the dispersion equation has the form u2",
    "t(k_z,)=k_z^2- = 0 , and its solution is : u3 k_z^2 = .",
    "two waves propagating or attenuating in both directions follow from the effective medium theory .",
    "the conventional isotropic plasma model leads to only two waves for a certain direction , namely , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .    for the following consideration of the refraction problem we will need to know properties of waves propagating in the @xmath1 direction . here",
    "we briefly revise these properties ( see our previous paper @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath16 versus the normalized frequency @xmath23 are presented in fig .",
    "[ cw ] for @xmath24 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath25",
    ". in the simple case of the conventional model ( dotted curve ) @xmath16 is imaginary if @xmath26 , and it is real if @xmath27 .",
    "the solution of the conventional model is completely wrong between @xmath28 and @xmath29 because it gives an imaginary value of @xmath16 instead of a real one which is obtained from the correct model .",
    "the correct , more complicated solutions , follow from eq .  .",
    "analyzing eq .  , one can see that there exist three frequency regions , corresponding to different kinds of solution .",
    "the first one is the low frequency band @xmath30 , where [ c1 ] k_1=k_p is the stop band edge : beyond this wave number the waves are propagating .",
    "there the propagation constant @xmath16 is complex despite the fact that we have assumed the medium to be lossless ( see fig .  [ cw ] ) . actually , there are two complex conjugate solutions for each re@xmath31 .",
    "the second frequency area is @xmath32 . at",
    "point @xmath29 one of the solutions is zero and within the range @xmath32 we have a forward wave and a backward wave with respect to the interface .",
    "it means that one of the waves has a positive projection of the wave vector on the interface inner normal , while the other wave has a negative projection .",
    "finally , for @xmath27 both of the waves are propagating forward waves .",
    "electrodynamical calculations @xcite ( using the three dimensional green s function ) confirm the results of the effective medium theory with a high accuracy in a wide spectral range including the regions of evanescent and propagating waves ( see solid and dashed curves in fig .",
    "note that point @xmath29 corresponds to the edge of the passband in the framework of the old model .",
    "thus , the model taking into account spatial dispersion leads to a considerably more complicated structure of eigenwaves than the conventional model of an isotropic plasma , and it is in very good agreement with the results of the full - wave analysis .",
    "as it was shown above , there exist two extraordinary waves with the wave vector and the electric field in the @xmath5 plane . assuming the @xmath0-component of the electric field of the incident wave to be equal to unity , and applying the continuity conditions of the tangential field components results in the reflection problem formulated as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the unknown reflection coefficient for electric field , @xmath35 are the unknown amplitudes of refracted waves in the wire medium , @xmath36 is the wave impedance ( tm ) in free space and @xmath37 are the wave impedances of the refracted waves . thus the problem becomes similar to one appearing in crystallooptics , where excitons arise and spatial dispersion",
    "can not be neglected @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty here is the necessity to invoke additional boundary conditions ( abc ) in order to match solutions at the interface of media .",
    "it was pointed out first by s.  pekar @xcite ( 1956 ) , that the well - known maxwell s boundary conditions ( [ q1 ] ) are not sufficient to connect the amplitudes of the incident and transmitted waves in adjoining media , if more than one independent wave can propagate in any medium .    probably , the first abc were proposed by s.  pekar @xcite , and his abc stay among the more often used in the theory of media with sd .",
    "the simplest phenomenological pekar s abc are the following : @xmath38 at the boundary , where * p * is the polarization vector .",
    "let us consider if we can apply to the wm the first condition of ( [ q2 ] ) in the region of evanescent waves .",
    "for the @xmath0-component of the polarization vector one can write @xmath39 where the susceptibilities @xmath40 and @xmath41 relate to different waves , but @xmath42 .",
    "hence we come to @xmath43 , which means that the reflection coefficient for the electric field @xmath44 .",
    "in other words , a semi - infinite wm behaves as a perfect metal plane .",
    "however , we know that it is not so even if only evanescent waves are excited in the wm .",
    "the reflected wave changes its phase due to penetration into wm , and this phase is not equal to @xmath45 . the same result is obtained considering condition @xmath46 .",
    "the second pekar s condition ( [ q2 ] ) ( for derivatives ) leads to a similar result .",
    "thus , the conventional pekar s abc are useless for solving our problem .    after pioneering pekar s publication different abc",
    "were proposed for problems of crystallooptics , as well as semiconductor and plasma electrodynamics .",
    "all of these works relate to specific media and take into account the properties of a sub - surface layer at the media interface ( see @xcite and the bibliography presented there ) . besides",
    ", phenomenological assumptions and experimental data are used in these theories .",
    "since wm strongly differs from a solid - state crystal , only general approaches to abc which do not concerned with particular media , may be interesting for us .",
    "many authors ( see , for example , @xcite ) derived abc from a given model of medium with an explicit specification of its surface . after simplifications these models give nothing more than pekar s abc . among different theories of sd media",
    "so - called  abc - free `` theories attract our attention .",
    "one of the ways for abc derivation is a concept of ' ' exciton dead layer \" , proposed by hopfield and thomas . actually , there is a layer in which exciton wave function has evanescent form .",
    "kikuo cho @xcite has pointed out that there is a certain limit of transition layer thickness , below which the abc theory is unnecessary . however , cho theory is not yet free from some parameters determined by specific surfaces .",
    "b.  chen and d.f .",
    "nelson declare that their work @xcite solves the macroscopic abc problem completely . despite that the authors of @xcite used a complicated quantum mechanical model , their derivation found that the fully macroscopic solution is equivalent to the use of pekar s abc @xmath47 .",
    "thus , such an approach also is not suitable for us .",
    "a.  vinogradov and co - authors , considering in @xcite effects of sd in composite metamaterials , have obtained abcs using an assumption of existence of additional waves in free space which are the same as in the metamaterial but have evanescent nature .",
    "this assumption leads to additional equations at the interface .",
    "another way to solve the problem was proposed recently by k. henneberger @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption of an abrupt transition from medium to vacuum .",
    "it is assumed that the incident wave excites a source @xmath48 , located within a sub - surface layer @xmath49 , and its thickness is assumed to be negligible .",
    "this approach is appropriate for our problem of wire media interface .",
    "indeed , it is known for problems of diffraction by single semi - infinite wire grids that the induced currents deviate from the regular amplitudes far from the interface only in a very narrow region whose width is of the order of the grating period @xcite .",
    "this conclusion holds for grids of wires both parallel and perpendicular to the edge . for this reason we assume that for the wire medium interface the transition layer has the thickness of only a few periods of the lattice .",
    "this thickness is much smaller than the wavelength and negligible as compared with the length of the wires ( wires are infinite in our model ) .    applying this approach to our interface problem of free space and the wire medium , the wave equation for @xmath50 in unbounded medium ( eq .   written for @xmath50 ) should be replaced by an inhomogeneous equation u4",
    "^2 h_x+h_x = s(z , ) , where @xmath50 is the refracted field .",
    "it means that any propagating wave has to be created by a source .",
    "the proper source of the penetrating wave in the wire medium is the incident wave and the polarization induced by it in the medium .",
    "such an externally controlled source can be identified with some polarization additionally induced to the one already described by @xmath51 .",
    "therefore it is located only on the surface and in the transition region , where the induced polarization deviates from that in the bulk medium .",
    "after fourier transform of eq .",
    "one obtains [ a10 ] h_x(z , ) = _ -^ , where @xmath52 is the fourier transform of @xmath48 and @xmath53 is determined by eq .  .",
    "assuming an abrupt transition from the medium to vacuum , we can present the source as a delta function @xmath54 , then @xmath55 . if @xmath53 is an analytical function , the integration in eq .",
    "( [ a10 ] ) can be performed using the residue method .",
    "residues can be found by presenting @xmath56 in the form u5 1=1= _ + + _ - , where the coefficients are _",
    "+ = k^2-k_p^2-k_z+^2 _ -=-k^2-k_p^2-k_z-^2 .",
    "the residues ( the relative amplitudes of the transmitted field components ) read r_+=_+= k^2-k_p^2-k_z+^2 r_-=_- = -k^2-k_p^2-k_z-^2 .",
    "finally , the field component @xmath50 in the wire medium is h_x = s_o = s_o .",
    "the expression for @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be obtained from the maxwell equations as k_zh_x = -k_0_y e_y ,  -k_yh_x = -k_0_z e_z , which gives us the electric field components in the wire medium v1 e_y = -s_o v2 e_z= k_y s_o .",
    "now we have expressions for all field components induced in the wire medium for the tm polarization .    in free space there exist incident and reflected tm waves .",
    "magnetic field components are h_x^i = h_0e^-jk_yye^-j_0 z ,  h_x^r = h_re^-jk_yye^j_0 z = r_hh_0e^-jk_yye^j_0 z , where @xmath57 and the electric field components are e_y^i=-_0h_0e^-jk_yye^-j_0 z ,  e_y^r= r_h_0h_0e^-jk_yye^j_0 z e_z^i = k_yh_0e^-jk_yye^-j_0 z ,  e_z^r= r_hk_yh_0e^-jk_yye^j_0 z. at the interface @xmath58 the continuity of the tangential field components leads to relations h_0+r_hh_0=s_0-_0h_0+_0r_hh_0 = -s_0 , from which the reflection coefficient for magnetic field is obtained : r_h= ( _ + + _ - ) - 1(_+ + _ - ) .",
    "finally , the explicit expression for the coefficient @xmath59 ( the transmission source ) is obtained : s_0=1+r_h  h_0=4h_0 .",
    "in the region of complex waves @xmath60 we have to chose the branches of the square roots for @xmath61 having positive imaginary parts . in the region",
    "@xmath62 it is necessary to take for the backward wave ( @xmath63 wave ) the root branch with the opposite sign . in the above derivation we evaluated the reflection coefficient for the magnetic field .",
    "the reflection coefficient for the electric field is @xmath64 .",
    "the plane wave reflection coefficient from an interface of a single wire medium where wires are along the @xmath1 axis is easily obtained as a special case of the previously considered double wire medium reflection problem . in a single wire medium the permittivity components are @xmath65 and @xmath66 . evaluating the dispersion equation we have as solutions @xmath67 , which is the propagation factor for the tem mode and @xmath68 for the tm mode .",
    "thus , in the single wire medium the two extraordinary eigenwaves are tem and tm polarized .",
    "we can use exactly the same expressions for the reflection coefficient as in the case of the double wire medium simply substituting @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to expressions for the coefficients _",
    "+ = k_p^2 _ -=k_y^2 and residues r_+=k_p^2 r_-=k_y^2 .",
    "fig .  [ r5 ] shows the phase of the reflected wave @xmath69 versus the incidence angle @xmath19 , calculated for different @xmath23 , corresponding to the region of complex waves ( see fig .  [ cw ] ) . here",
    "re@xmath70 and im@xmath70 are the real and imaginary parts of the reflection coefficient @xmath71 .",
    "the calculations have been performed using the model , taking into account spatial dispersion , and the conventional one , [ aa5 ] _",
    "y=_z=_h(1- ) .",
    "as it is expected , both models give the modulus of the reflection coefficient equal to unity due to the absence of losses and propagating waves in wire medium .",
    "it is remarkable , that the spatial dispersion results in a weak dependence of the phase of the reflected wave on the incidence angle .",
    "the parameters of the wire medium are taken as above in the eigenvalues calculations .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the reflection coefficient in a wide spectral range cover areas with complex waves , fw and bw waves and fw waves only , are presented in fig .",
    "the incidence angle is taken to be @xmath72 .",
    "for understanding of these characteristics it is useful to compare them with the eigenvalue dispersion ( fig .",
    "distinctive points @xmath28 , where propagating waves appear in the framework of new model , and @xmath29 , where both of the waves become forward ones .",
    "results , given by the old model , are also shown here .",
    "the most important feature is that the area of propagating waves shifts by @xmath73 in comparison with that given by the old model .",
    "in this section we will discuss the group velocity and poynting vectors of waves excited in a double wire medium and check the power conservation at the interface .",
    "it is well known that the group velocity is defined as u7 v_gr = grad_*k*. the poynting vector that determines the energy density flow for media with spatial dispersion has the form @xcite : # s=1re\\{#e#h^*}-_ike^*_ie_k , where the permittivity dyadic components are expressed by formulae for dwm .",
    "their partial derivatives read = 0 ,  _",
    "y=-2k_p^2k_y ,  _ z=-2k_p^2k_z .",
    "let us derive expressions for the poynting vector in free space and in the wire medium .",
    "in free space the field expressions are # h_1=h_0[e^-j_0 z+r_h e^j_0 z]e^-jk_yy#u_x # e_1= _ 0h_0 [ -e^-j_0z+r_he^j_0 z]e^-jk_yy#u_y + k_yh_0 [ e^-j_0z+r_he^j_0 z]e^-jk_yy#u_z .",

    "as an example , we consider excitation of modes , located above the plasma frequency @xcite . for the taken parameters of dwm , the wire radius @xmath4=0.01  cm , and the period @xmath2=1  cm ,",
    "the plasma wavenumber is @xmath77  @xmath78 .",

    "the calculations were performed at @xmath79 .",
    "the value of the tangential component @xmath11 is determined by the incidence angle @xmath19 , namely , @xmath18 .",
    "the direction of the group velocity , found by numerical differentiation of the dispersion characteristics , exactly coincides with the direction of @xmath80 , calculated using formulae . disregarding the term that takes into account spatial dispersion leads to a strongly incorrect result , illustrated by dashed curves .",
    "next , let us consider the power conservation at the interface of free space and the wire medium .",
    "it is important to check this properly because in the wire medium region there exist two waves , and the wire medium is spatially dispersive . in the frequency range considered here the parameter values are assumed to be real .",

    "see @xcite and also replies @xcite , we suppose that application of this approach has allowed us to overcome the problem of additional waves appearing in media with spatial dispersion and to obtain reasonable results for reflection coefficient and for the power densities and group velocities of the refracted waves .",
