    "the 2d spectroscopy observations with ifp at the 6 m telescope using the cigale system were begun in early 80s by teams from marseille observatory ( france ) and from sao ( boulesteix et al . , 1982 ; amram et al . ,",
    "1992 ) . in 1997",
    "a ccd was attached on the old focal reducer instead of photon counter .",
    "a new multi - mode focal reducer scorpio ( spectral camera with optical reducer for photometrical and interferometrical observations ) was developed in the sao ras in 2000 ( afanasiev et al .",
    ", this proceeding ) .",
    "here we describe only fabry - perot mode of the scorpio . for more details",
    "see our www - site + ` http://www.sao.ru/~moisav/scorpio/scorpio.html ` .",
    "the optics of scorpio compensates the aberrations of the main telescope mirror and provide a total focal ration @xmath0 .",
    "the queensgate ifps et-50 installs into the 35 mm collimated beam .",
    "scorpio are under full remote control from a pc .",
    "a total dqe ( telescope@xmath1filter@xmath1ifp@xmath1ccd ) is about @xmath2 in the @xmath3 spectral region .",
    "scorpio equipped with narrow filters ( @xmath4 ) for ifp observations in the @xmath3 line for object s velocities @xmath5 .",
    "focal reducer mounted on the prime focus universal adapter which has two movable probes for offset guiding and continuum and spectral lamps for calibration . a he - ne - ar lamp and continuum spectrum lamp mounted in the integration sphere which produced a uniform lighting .",
    "the optics of calibration system forms the @xmath6 beam on the reducer entrance .",
    "there is no systematic shift in velocities because telecentrical beams used for wavelength calibration .",
    "a ccd has a large advantage in quantum effeciency in comparison with a photon counter .",
    "however a readout noise and a reading time do not allow to do very short exposures of the object channels .",
    "therefore exist a problem of the photometry correction of flux and seeing in the individual channels because only 1 - 2 scanning cycles per channel may be accepted on ccd observations , we should take in account a time dependence of a sky brightness and of an atmospheric extinction .",
    "therefore wavelength object cube contains a set of narrow rings ( fig .",
    "this pattern limits the velocities measurements for the low brightness objects .",
    "we suggest a method to resolve this problem .",
    "main idea is removing the sky counts _ before _ cube linerization .",
    "after standard ccd - reduction a mean radial profile of the sky lines is constructed by the azimuthal averaging of the interferometrical rings ( fig .",
    "the sky radial profile are subtracted from the object .",
    "1b shows example of the sky subtracted images .",
    "variations of an atmospheric extinction , seeing and channel offset shifts could be measured from the photometry of background stars and corrected in the cube .",
    "unfortunately our method requires that about half of field of view will be free from the object emission , but it allows to obtain a good results in the object cube ."
