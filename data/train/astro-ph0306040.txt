    "fifteen years prior to their discovery in 1979 , refsdal ( 1964 ) outlined how gravitationally lensed quasars might be used to determine the hubble constant .",
    "astronomers have spent the quarter century since their discovery working out the difficult details not considered in refsdal s seminal papers .",
    "the difficulties encountered fall into two broad categories  measurement and modeling .",
    "time delays can be hard to measure if the fluxes of the images do not vary , or if the images are faint , or if they lie very close to each other .",
    "modeling gravitational potentials with a small number of constraints is likewise difficult , either because the lens geometry is complex or because the data poorly constrain the most important aspects of the gravitational potential .",
    "we will argue that these difficulties are surmountable , both in principle and in practice , and that an effort considerably smaller than that of the _ hst _  hubble constant key project will yield a considerably smaller uncertainty in the hubble constant , @xmath0 .    while the number of systems with measured time delays is small , their interpretation implies a value for @xmath0 , which , given our current understanding of the dark matter distributions of galaxies , is formally inconsistent with that obtained using cepheids .",
    "the key project value of @xmath7  ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) is consistent with the lens data only if the lens galaxies have significantly less dark matter than is expected theoretically or has been measured for other early - type galaxies . while it is premature to argue for replacing the local estimates , we hope to persuade the astronomical community that the time delay result deserves both careful attention and further study .",
    "interpreting time delays requires a model for the gravitational potential of the lens , and in most cases the uncertainties in the model dominate the uncertainty in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the main focus of this review will be to explain the dependence of time delays on gravitational potentials .",
    "we start in  [ sec : basics ] by introducing the time delay method and illustrating the physics of time delays with a series of simple models . in  [",
    "sec : theory ] we review a general mathematical theory of time delays to show that , for most lenses , the only important parameter of the model is the mean surface density of the lens at the radius of the images . in  [ sec : clusters ] we discuss the effects of the environment of the lens on time delays .",
    "we review the data on the time delay lenses in  [ sec : data ] and their implications for the hubble constant and dark matter in early - type galaxies in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the present time delay lenses have a degeneracy between @xmath0 and the amount of dark matter , so in  [ sec : profile ] we outline several approaches that can eliminate the degeneracy . finally , in  [",
    "sec : future ] we discuss the future of time delays .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we assume a flat , @xmath8 , @xmath9 cosmological model .",
    "the observations of gravitationally lensed quasars are best understood in light of fermat s principle ( e.g. , blandford & narayan 1986 ) .",
    "intervening mass between a source and an observer introduces an effective index of refraction , thereby increasing the light - travel time . the competition between this shapiro delay from the gravitational field and",
    "the geometric delay due to bending the ray paths leads to the formation of multiple images at the stationary points ( minima , maxima , and saddle points ) of the travel time ( for more complete reviews , see narayan & bartelmann 1999 or schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ) .",
    "as with glass optics , there is a thin - lens approximation that applies when the optics are small compared to the distances to the source and the observer . in this approximation",
    ", we need only the effective potential , @xmath10 , found by integrating the 3d potential @xmath11 along the line of sight .",
    "the light - travel time is @xmath12    \\left[{d_{l } d_{s}\\over d_{ls } } \\right ]    \\left [ { 1\\over 2 } \\left(\\vx - \\vec{\\beta}\\right)^2 -    \\psi\\left(\\vx\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the angular positions of the image and the source , @xmath15 is the effective potential , @xmath16 is the geometric delay in the small - angle approximation , @xmath17 is the lens redshift , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are angular - diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "the only dimensioned quantity in the travel time is a factor of @xmath21  gyr arising from the @xmath22 scaling of the angular - diameter distances .",
    "we observe the images at the extrema of the time delay function , which we find by setting the gradients with respect to the image positions equal to zero , @xmath23 , and finding all the stationary points ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) associated with a given source position @xmath14 .",
    "the local magnification of an image is determined by the magnification tensor @xmath27 , whose inverse is determined by the second derivatives of the time delay function , @xmath28 where the convergence @xmath29 is the local surface density in units of the critical surface density @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 define the local shear field and its orientation .",
    "the determinant of the magnification tensor is the net magnification of the image , but it is a signed quantity depending on whether the image has positive ( maxima , minima ) or negative ( saddle points ) parity .",
    "a simple but surprisingly realistic starting point for modeling lens potentials is the singular isothermal sphere ( the sis model ) in which the lens potential is simply @xmath33 is a deflection scale determined by geometry and @xmath34 is the 1d velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the sis lens produces two colinear images at radii @xmath36 and @xmath37 on opposite sides of the lens galaxy ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] but with @xmath38 ) .",
    ", so the total image separation is always @xmath39 .",

    "the model parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , can be determined uniquely from the image positions . ]",
    "the a image is a minimum of the time delay and leads the saddle point , b , with a time delay difference of @xmath44 \\left[{d_{l } d_{s}\\over d_{ls } } \\right ]       ( r_a^2 - r_b^2 ) .",
    "\\label{eqn : sis}\\ ] ] typical time delay differences of months or years are the consequence of multiplying the @xmath45  gyr total propagation times by the square of a very small angle ( @xmath46 radians",
    "so , @xmath47 ) .",
    "the sis model suggests that lens time delay measurements reduce the determination of the hubble constant to a problem of differential astrometry .",
    "this is almost correct , but we have made two idealizations in using the sis model .",
    "the first idealization was to ignore deviations of the radial ( monopole ) density profile from that of an sis with density @xmath48 , surface density @xmath49 , and a flat rotation curve .",
    "the sis is a special case of a power - law monopole with lens potential @xmath50 corresponding to a ( 3d ) density distribution with density @xmath51 , surface density @xmath52 , and rotation curve @xmath53 .",
    "for @xmath54 we recover the sis model , and the normalization is chosen so that the scale @xmath55 is always the einstein ring radius .",
    "models with smaller ( larger ) @xmath56 have less ( more ) centrally concentrated mass distributions and have rising ( falling ) rotation curves .",
    "the limit @xmath57 approaches the potential of a point mass . by adjusting the scale @xmath55 and the source position @xmath58 , we can fit the observed positions of two images at radii @xmath59 and @xmath60 on opposite sides ( @xmath38 ) of the lens for any value of @xmath56 .",
    ", and the magnification ratio depends on @xmath56 .",
    "unfortunately , the systematic errors created by milli- and microlensing make it difficult to use flux ratios as model constraints ( see  ) . ]",
    "the expression for the time delay difference can be well approximated by ( witt , mao , & keeton 2000 ; kochanek  2002 ) @xmath61 ,      \\label{eqn : powerlaw}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( see fig .  [ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "while the expansion assumes @xmath64 ( or @xmath58 ) is small , we can usually ignore the higher - order terms .",
    "there are two important lessons from this model .",
    "1 .   image astrometry of simple two - image and four - image lenses generally can not constrain the radial mass distribution of the lens .",
    "more centrally concentrated mass distributions ( larger @xmath56 ) predict longer time delays , resulting in a larger hubble constant for a given time delay measurement .      the second idealization was to ignore deviations from circular symmetry due to either the ellipticity of the lens galaxy or the local tidal gravity field from nearby objects .",
    "a very nice analytic example of a lens with angular structure is a singular isothermal model with _",
    "arbitrary _ angular structure , where the effective potential is @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is an arbitrary function .",
    "the model family includes the most common lens model , the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) .",
    "the time delays for this model family are simply @xmath67 , _ independent of the angular structure of the lens _ ( witt et al .  2000 ) !",
    "this result , while attractive , does not hold in general , and we will require the results of  [ sec : theory ] to understand the effects of angular structure in the potential .",
    "the need to model the gravitational potential of the lens is the aspect of interpreting time delays that creates the greatest suspicion .",
    "the most extreme view is that it renders the project `` hopeless '' because we will never be able to guarantee that the models encompass the degrees of freedom needed to capture all the systematic uncertainties . in order to address these fears",
    "we must show that we understand the specific properties of the gravitational potential determining time delays and then ensure that our parameterized models include these degrees of freedom .",
    "the examples we considered in  [ sec : basics ] illustrate the basic physics of time delays , but an extensive catalog of ( non)parametric models demonstrating the same properties may not be convincing to the skeptic .",
    "we will instead show , using standard mathematical expansions of the potential , which properties of the lens galaxy are required to understand time delays with accuracies of a few percent .",
    "while we can understand the results of all models for the time delays of gravitational lenses based on this simple theory , full numerical models should probably be used for most detailed , quantitative analyses .",
    "fortunately , there are publically available programs for both the parametric and nonparametric approaches.castles ) packages include a very broad range of parametric models for the mass distributions of lenses , and the _ pixellens _ package ( williams & saha  2000 , ankh-morpork.maths.qmw.ac.uk/@xmath68saha/astron/lens/pix/ ) implements a nonparametric approach . ]",
    "our analysis uses the geometry of the schematic lens shown in figure  [ fig : geometry ] .",
    "the two images define an annulus bounded by their radii , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and with an interior region for @xmath69 and an exterior region for @xmath70 .",
    "the key to understanding time delays comes from gorenstein , falco , & shapiro ( 1988 ; see also saha  2000 ) , who showed that the time delay of a circular lens depends only on the image positions and the _ surface density @xmath71 in the annulus between the images_. the mass of the interior region is implicit in the image positions and accurately determined by the astrometry . from gauss law , we know that the radial distribution of the mass in the interior region and the amount or distribution of mass in the exterior region is irrelevant .",
    "a useful approximation is to assume that the surface density in the annulus can be _ locally _ approximated by a power law @xmath72 and that the mean surface density in the annulus is @xmath73 .",
    "the time delay between the images is ( kochanek  2002 ) @xmath74 .",
    "\\label{eqn : monopole}\\ ] ] thus , the time delay is largely determined by the average density @xmath1 , with only modest corrections from the local shape of the surface density distribution even when @xmath75 .",
    "for example , the second - order expansion is exact for an sis lens ( @xmath76 , @xmath54 ) and reproduces the time delay of a point mass lens ( @xmath77 ) to better than 1% even when @xmath78 .",
    "this local model also explains the time delay scalings of the global power - law models we discussed in  [ sec : basics ] . a @xmath51 global power law has surface density @xmath79 near the einstein ring , so the leading term of the time delay is @xmath80 , just as in equation  ( [ eqn : powerlaw ] ) .",
    "gorenstein et al .  (",
    "1988 ) considered only circular lenses , but a multipole expansion allows us to understand the role of angular structure ( kochanek  2002 ) .",
    "an estimate to the same order as in equation  ( [ eqn : monopole ] ) requires only the quadrupole moments of the regions interior and exterior to the annulus , provided the strengths of the higher - order multipoles of the potential have the same order of magnitude as for an ellipsoidal density distribution .",
    ", has dimensionless amplitude @xmath81 , then it produces ray deflections of order @xmath82 at the einstein ring of the lens . in a four - image lens",
    "the quadrupole deflections are comparable to the thickness of the annulus , so @xmath83 . in a two - image lens",
    "they are smaller than the thickness of the annulus , so @xmath84 . for an ellipsoidal density distribution ,",
    "the @xmath85 multipole amplitude scales as @xmath86 .",
    "this allows us to ignore the quadrupole density distribution in the annulus and all higher - order multipoles .",
    "it is important to remember that potentials are much rounder than surface densities [ with relative amplitudes for a @xmath87 multipole of roughly @xmath88:@xmath89:1 for potentials : deflections : densities ] , so the multipoles relevant to time delays converge rapidly even for very flat surface density distributions . ]",
    "this approximation can fail for the lenses in clusters ( see  [ sec : clusters ] ) .",
    "the complete expansion for @xmath90 when the two quadrupole moments have independent amplitudes and orientations is not very informative .",
    "however , the leading term of the expansion when the two quadrupole moments are aligned illustrates the role of angular structure . given an exterior quadrupole ( i.e. , an external shear ) of amplitude @xmath91 and an interior quadrupole of amplitude @xmath92 sharing a common axis @xmath32 , the quadrupole potential is @xmath93 if we define the amplitudes at radius @xmath94 . for images at positions @xmath95 and @xmath96 relative to the lens galaxy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) , the leading term of the time delay is 12_ab @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the fraction of the quadrupole due to the interior quadrupole moment @xmath92 . we need not worry about the possibility of a singular denominator  successful global models of the lens do not allow such configurations .",
    "a two - image lens has too few astrometric constraints to fully constrain a model with independent , misaligned internal and external quadrupoles .",
    "fortunately , when the lensed images lie on opposite sides of the lens galaxy ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) , the time delay becomes insensitive to the quadrupole structure . provided the angular deflections",
    "are smaller than the radial deflections ( @xmath102 ) , the leading term of the time delay reduces to the result for a circular lens , @xmath103 .",
    "there is , however , one limiting case to remember . if the images and the lens are colinear , as in a spherical lens , the component of the shear aligned with the separation vector acts like a contribution to the convergence . in most lenses",
    "this would be a modest additional uncertainty  in the typical lens these shears must be small , the sign of the effect should be nearly random , and it is only a true degeneracy in the limit that everything is colinear .",
    "a four - image lens has more astrometric constraints and can constrain a model with independent , misaligned internal and external quadrupoles .",
    "the quadrupole moments of the observed lenses are dominated by external shear , with @xmath104 unless there is more than one lens galaxy inside the einstein ring .",
    "the ability of the astrometry to constrain @xmath105 is important because the delays depend strongly on @xmath105 when the images do not lie on opposite sides of the galaxy . if external shears dominate , @xmath106 and the leading term of the delay becomes @xmath107 .",
    "if the model is isothermal , like the @xmath108 models we considered in  [ sec : basics ] , then @xmath109 and we again find that the delay is independent of the angle , with @xmath110 .",
    "the time delay ratios in a four - image lens are largely determined by the angular structure and provide a check of the potential model .    in summary ,",
    "if we want to understand time delays to an accuracy competitive with studies of the local distance scale ( 5%10% ) , the only important variable is the surface density @xmath1 of the lens in the annulus between the images .",
    "when models based on the same data for the time delay and the image positions predict different values for @xmath0 , the differences can always be understood as the consequence of different choices for @xmath1 . in parametric models @xmath1 is adjusted by changing the central concentration of the lens ( i.e. , like @xmath56 in the global power - law models ) , and in the nonparametric models of williams & saha  ( 2000 ) it is adjusted directly .",
    "the expansion models of zhao & qin ( 2003a , b ) mix aspects of both approaches .",
    "most galaxies are not isolated , and many early - type lens galaxies are members of groups or clusters , so we need to consider the effects of the local environment on the time delays .",
    "weak perturbations are easily understood since they will simply be additional contributions to the surface density ( @xmath1 ) and the external shear / quadrupole ( @xmath91 ) we discussed in  [ sec : theory ] . in this section",
    "we focus on the consequences of large perturbations .    as a first approximation",
    "we can assume that a nearby cluster ( or galaxy ) can be modeled by an sis potential , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the einstein radius of the cluster and @xmath113 is the position of the cluster relative to the primary lens .",
    "we can understand its effects by expanding the potential as a series in @xmath114 , dropping constant and linear terms that have no observable consequences , to find that @xmath115 the first term has the form @xmath116 , which is the potential of a uniform sheet whose surface density @xmath117 is that of the cluster at the lens center .",
    "the second term has the form @xmath118 , which is the ( external ) tidal shear @xmath119 that would be produced by putting all the cluster mass inside a ring of radius @xmath120 at the cluster center .",
    "all realistic lens models need to incorporate a tidal shear term due to objects near the lens or along the line of sight ( keeton , kochanek , & seljak 1997 ) , but as we discussed in  [ sec : theory ] the shear does not lead to significant ambiguities in the time delay estimates . usually the local shear can not be associated with a particular object unless it is quite strong ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "contributed by material along the line of sight ( barkana 1996 ) .",
    "this introduces small uncertainties in the @xmath0 estimates for individual lenses ( an rms convergence of @xmath122 , depending on the source redshift ) , but is an unimportant source of uncertainty in estimates from ensembles of lenses because it is a random variable that averages to zero . ]",
    "the problems with nearby objects arise when the convergence @xmath123 becomes large because of a global degeneracy known as the _ mass - sheet degeneracy _ ( falco , gorenstein , & shapiro 1985 ) .",
    "if we have a model predicting a time delay @xmath124 and then add a sheet of constant surface density @xmath123 , then the time delay is changed to @xmath125 without changing the image positions , flux ratios , or time delay ratios .",
    "its effects can be understood from  [",
    "sec : theory ] as a contribution to the annular surface density with @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the parameters of the lens , in particular the mass scale @xmath55 , are also rescaled by factors of @xmath128 , so the degeneracy can be broken if there is an independent mass estimate for either the cluster or the galaxy .",
    ", as most mass distributions are more centrally concentrated than isothermal .",
    "] when the convergence is due to an object like a cluster , there is a strong correlation between the convergence @xmath123 and the shear @xmath129 that is controlled by the density distribution of the cluster ( for our isothermal model @xmath130 ) . in most circumstances , neglecting the extra surface density coming from nearby objects ( galaxies , groups , clusters ) leads to an overestimate of the hubble constant because these objects all have @xmath131 .",
    "if the cluster is sufficiently close , then we can not ignore the higher - order perturbations in the expansion of equation  ( [ eqn : cluster ] ) .",
    "they are quantitatively important when they produce deflections at the einstein ring radius @xmath55 of the primary lens , @xmath132 , that are larger than the astrometric uncertainties . because these uncertainties are small",
    ", the higher - order terms quickly become important .",

    "2002b ; dalal & kochanek  2002 ; schechter et al .",
    "2003 or schechter & wambsganss  2002 ) .",
    "once the flux errors are enlarged to the 30% level of these systematic errors , they provide little leverage for discriminating between models .",
    "we can also divide the systems by the complexity of the required lens model .",
    "we define eight of the lenses as `` simple , '' in the sense that the available data suggests that a model consisting of a single primary lens in a perturbing shear ( tidal gravity ) field should be an adequate representation of the gravitational potential .",
    "in some of these cases , an external potential representing a nearby galaxy or parent group will improve the fits , but the differences between the tidal model and the more complicated perturbing potential are small ( see  [ sec : clusters ] ) .",
    "we include the quotation marks because the classification is based on an impression of the systems from the available data and models .",
    "while we can not guarantee that a system is simple , we can easily recognize two complications that will require more complex models .",
    "the first complication is that some primary lenses have less massive satellite galaxies inside or near their einstein rings .",
    "this includes two of the time delay lenses , rxj0911 + 0551 and b1608 + 656 .",
    "rxj0911 + 0551 could simply be a projection effect , since neither lens galaxy shows irregular isophotes . here",
    "the implication for models may simply be the need to include all the parameters ( mass , position , ellipticity @xmath26 ) required to describe the second lens galaxy , and with more parameters we would expect greater uncertainties in @xmath0 . in b1608 + 656 , however , the lens galaxies show the heavily disturbed isophotes typical of galaxies undergoing a disruptive interaction .",
    "how one should model such a system is unclear .",
    "if there was once dark matter associated with each of the galaxies , how is it distributed now ?",
    "is it still associated with the individual galaxies ?",
    "has it settled into an equilibrium configuration ?",
    "while b1608 + 656 can be well fit with standard lens models ( fassnacht et al .",
    "2002 ) , these complications have yet to be explored .",
    "the second complication occurs when the primary lens is a member of a more massive ( x - ray ) cluster , as in the time delay lenses rxj0911 + 0551 ( morgan et al .",
    "2001 ) and q0957 + 561 ( chartas et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the cluster model is critical to interpreting these systems ( see  [ sec : clusters ] ) .",
    "the cluster surface density at the position of the lens ( @xmath141 ) leads to large corrections to the time delay estimates and the higher - order perturbations are crucial to obtaining a good model .",
    "for example , models in which the q0957 + 561 cluster was treated simply as an external shear are grossly incorrect ( see the review of q0957 + 561 models in keeton et al .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties in the cluster model itself , we must also decide how to include and model the other cluster galaxies near the primary lens .",
    "thus , lenses in clusters have many reasonable degrees of freedom beyond those of the `` simple '' lenses .      with our understanding of the theory and observations of the lenses we will now explore their implications for @xmath0 .",
    "we focus on the `` simple '' lenses pg1115 + 080 , sbs1520 + 530 , b1600 + 434 , and he21492745 .",
    "we only comment on the interpretation of the he11041805 delay because the measurement is too recent to have been interpreted carefully .",
    "we will briefly discuss the more complicated systems rxj0911 + 0551 , q0957 + 561 , and b1608 + 656 , and we will not discuss the systems with problematic time delays or astrometry .",
    "the most common , simple , realistic model of a lens consists of a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) in an external ( tidal ) shear field ( keeton et al .",
    "the model has 7 parameters ( the lens position , mass , ellipticity , major axis orientation for the sie , and the shear amplitude and orientation ) .",
    "it has many degrees of freedom associated with the angular structure of the potential , but the radial structure is fixed with @xmath142 . for comparison , a two - image ( four - image ) lens supplies 5 ( 13 ) constraints on any model of the potential : 2 ( 6 ) from the relative positions of the images , 1 ( 3 ) from the flux ratios of the images , 0 ( 2 ) from the inter - image time delay ratios , and 2 from the lens position . with the addition of extra components ( satellites / clusters ) for the more complex lenses ,",
    "this basic model provides a good fit to all the time delay lenses except q0957 + 561 .",
    "although a naive counting of the degrees of freedom ( @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively ) suggests that estimates of @xmath0 would be underconstrained for two - image lenses and overconstrained for four - image lenses , the uncertainties are actually dominated by those of the time delay measurements and the astrometry in both cases .",
    "this is what we expect from  [ sec : theory ]  the model has no degrees of freedom that change @xmath1 or @xmath56 , so there will be little contribution to the uncertainties in @xmath0 from the model for the potential .",
    "if we use a model that includes parameters to control the radial density profile ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) , for example by adding a halo truncation radius @xmath145 to the sis profile [ the pseudo - jaffe model , @xmath146 ; e.g. , impey et al .  1998 ;",
    "burud et al .",
    "2002a ] , then we find the expected correlation between @xmath145 and @xmath0  as we make the halo more concentrated ( smaller @xmath145 ) , the estimate of @xmath0 rises from the value for the sis profile ( @xmath76 as @xmath147 ) to the value for a point mass ( @xmath77 as @xmath148 ) , with the fastest changes occurring when @xmath145 is similar to the einstein radius of the lens .",
    "we show an example of such a model for pg1115 + 080 in figure  [ fig : paul ] .",
    "this case is somewhat more complicated than a pure pseudo - jaffe model because there is an additional contribution to the surface density from the group to which the lens galaxy belongs .",
    "as long as the structure of the radial density profile is fixed ( constant @xmath145 ) , the uncertainties are again dominated by the uncertainties in the time delay .",
    "unfortunately , the goodness of fit , @xmath149 , shows too little dependence on @xmath145 to determine @xmath0 uniquely . in general , two - image lenses",
    "have too few constraints , and the extra constraints supplied by a four - image lens constrain the angular structure rather than the radial structure of the potential .",
    "this basic problem holds for all existing models of the current sample of time delay lenses .",
    "the inability of the present time delay lenses to directly constrain the radial density profile is the major problem for using them to determine @xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , it is a consequence of the available data on the current sample rather than a fundamental limitation , as we discuss in the next section (  [ sec : profile ] ) .",
    "it is , however , a simple trade - off  models with less dark matter ( lower @xmath1 , more centrally concentrated densities ) produce higher hubble constants than those with more dark matter .",
    "we do have some theoretical limits on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we can be confident that the surface density is bounded by two limiting models .",
    "the mass distribution should not be more compact than the luminosity distribution , so a constant mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath4 ) model should set a lower limit on @xmath150 , and an upper limit on estimates of @xmath0 .",
    "we are also confident that the typical lens should not have a rising rotation curve at 12 optical effective radii from the center of the lens galaxy .",
    "thus , the sis model is probably the least concentrated reasonable model , setting an upper bound on @xmath151 , and a lower limit on estimates of @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : problem ] shows joint estimates of @xmath0 from the four simple lenses for these two limiting mass distributions ( kochanek  2003b ) .",
    "the results for the individual lenses are mutually consistent and are unchanged by the new @xmath152  day delay for the a@xmath153-a@xmath154 images in pg1115 + 080 ( chartas 2003 ) . for galaxies with isothermal profiles",
    "we find @xmath155  , and for galaxies with constant @xmath4 we find @xmath156  . while our best prior estimate for the mass distribution is the isothermal profile ( see  [ sec : profile ] ) , the lens galaxies would have to have constant @xmath4 to match key project estimate of @xmath157   ( freedman et al .  2001 ) .",
    "the difference between these two limits is entirely explained by the differences in @xmath1 and @xmath56 between the sis and constant @xmath4 models .",
    "in fact , it is possible to reduce the @xmath0 estimates for each simple lens to an approximation formula , @xmath158 .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , are derived from the image positions using the simple theory from  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "these approximations reproduce numerical results using ellipsoidal lens models to accuracies of @xmath161   ( kochanek 2002 ) .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : paul ] we also show the estimate of @xmath0 computed based on the simple theory of  [ sec : theory ] and the annular surface density ( @xmath1 ) and slope ( @xmath56 ) of the numerical models .",
    "the agreement with the full numerical solutions is excellent , even though the numerical models include both the ellipsoidal lens galaxy and a group .",
    "no matter what the mass distribution is , the five lenses pg1115 + 080 , sbs1520 + 530 , b1600 + 434 , pks1830211 , and he21492745 have very similar dark matter halos . for a fixed slope @xmath56 , the five systems are consistent with a common value for the surface density of @xmath162 where @xmath163   and there is an upper limit of @xmath164 on the intrinsic scatter of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , time delay lenses provide a new window into the structure and homogeneity of dark matter halos , regardless of the actual value of @xmath0 .",
    "there is an enormous range of parametric models that can illustrate how the extent of the halo affects @xmath1 and hence @xmath0  the pseudo - jaffe model we used above is only one example .",
    "it is useful , however , to use a physically motivated model where the lens galaxy is embedded in a standard nfw ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 ) profile halo .",
    "the lens galaxy consists of the baryons that have cooled to form stars , so the mass of the visible galaxy can be parameterized using the cold baryon fraction @xmath165 of the halo , and for these cdm halo models the value of @xmath1 is controlled by the cold baryon fraction ( kochanek  2003a ) .",
    "a constant @xmath4 model is the limit @xmath166 ( with @xmath167 , @xmath168 ) . since the baryonic mass fraction of a cdm halo should not exceed the global fraction of @xmath169 ( e.g. , wang , tegmark , & zaldarriaga 2002 ) , we can not use constant @xmath4 models without also abandoning cdm .",
    "as we reduce @xmath165 , we are adding mass to an extended halo around the lens , leading to an increase in @xmath1 and a decrease in @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath170 the model closely resembles the sis model ( @xmath142 , @xmath171 ) .",
    "if we reduce @xmath165 further , the mass distribution begins to approach that of the nfw halo without any cold baryons .",
    "figure  [ fig : cdm ] shows how @xmath1 and @xmath0 depend on @xmath165 for pg1115 + 080 , sbs1520 + 530 , b1600 + 434 and he21492745 . when @xmath170 , the cdm models have parameters very similar to the sis model , and we obtain a very similar estimate of @xmath172   ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "if all baryons cool , and @xmath173 , then we obtain @xmath174   ( 95% confidence ) , which is still lower than the key project estimates .",
    "we excluded the lenses requiring significantly more complicated models with multiple lens galaxies or very strong perturbations from clusters .",
    "if we have yet to reach a consensus on the mass distribution of relatively isolated lenses , it seems premature to extend the discussion to still more complicated systems .",
    "we can , however , show that the clusters lenses require significant contributions to @xmath1 from the cluster in order to produce the same @xmath0 as the more isolated systems . as we discussed in ",
    "[ sec : data ] the three more complex systems are rxj0911 + 0551 , q0957 + 561 and b1608 + 656 .",
    "rxj0911 + 0551 is very strongly perturbed by the nearby x - ray cluster ( morgan et al .",
    "2001 ; hjorth et al .",
    "kochanek ( 2003b ) found @xmath175   if the primary lens and its satellite were isothermal and @xmath176   if they had constant mass - to - light ratios .",

    "the hjorth et al .  ( 2002 ) models also included many more cluster galaxies assuming fixed masses and halo sizes .",
    "q0957 + 561 is a special case because the primary lens galaxy is the brightest cluster galaxy and it lies nearly at the cluster center ( keeton et al .",
    "2000 ; chartas et al .",
    "2002 ) . as a result , the lens modeling problems are particularly severe , and keeton et al .",

    "a satisfactory treatment of this lens remains elusive .",
    "he11041805 had its delay measured ( ofek & maoz 2003 ) just as we completed this review . assuming the @xmath179  day delay is correct , a standard sie model of this system predicts a very high @xmath180  .",
    "the geometry of this system and the fact that the inner image is brighter than the outer image both suggest that he11041805 lies in an anomalously high tidal shear field , while the standard model includes a prior to keep the external shear small .",
    "a prior is needed because a two - image lens supplies too few constraints to determine both the ellipticity of the main lens and the external shear simultaneously .",
    "since the images and the lens in he11041805 are nearly colinear , the anomalous @xmath0 estimate for the standard model may be an example of the shear degeneracy we briefly mentioned in  [ sec : theory ] . at present",
    "the model surveys needed to understand the new delay have not been made .",
    "observations of the geometry of the host galaxy einstein ring will resolve any ambiguities due to the shear in the near future ( see  [ sec : profile ] ) .",
    "the lens b1608 + 656 consists of two interacting galaxies , and , as we discussed in  [ sec : data ] , this leads to a greatly increased parameter space .",
    "fassnacht et al .",

    "images ( the statistical errors are negligible ) .",
    "the position differences are probably created by extinction effects from the dust in the lens galaxies .",
    "like isothermal models of the `` simple '' lenses , the @xmath0 estimate is below local values , but the disagreement is smaller .",
    "these models correctly match the observed time delay ratios .",
    "we can take four approaches to solving the central concentration problem .",
    "first , the density profiles of galaxies are not a complete mystery , and we could apply the constraints derived from observations of other ( early - type ) galaxies to the time delay systems .",
    "second , we could make new observations of the existing time delay lenses in order to obtain additional data that would constrain the density profiles .",
    "third , we could measure the time delays in the systems where the lens galaxies already have well - constrained densities .",
    "fourth , we can use the statistical properties of time delay lenses to break the degeneracies seen in individual lenses .",
    "if we assume that the time delay lenses have the same density structure as other early - type galaxies , then models close to isothermal are favored . for lenses with extended or multi - component sources ,",
    "the lens models constrain the density distributions and the best fit models are usually very close to isothermal ( e.g. , cohn et al . 2001 ; winn , rusin , & kochanek 2003 ) .",
    "stellar dynamical observations of lenses also favor isothermal models ( e.g. , treu & koopmans  2002a ) .",
    "stellar dynamical ( e.g. , romanowsky & kochanek  1999 ; gerhard et al .",
    "2001 ) and x - ray ( e.g. , loewenstein & mushotzky  2003 ) observations of nearby early - type galaxies generally find flat rotation curves on the relevant scales . finally , weak lensing analyses require significant dark matter on large scales in early - type galaxies ( mckay et al .",
    "2002 ) . in general",
    ", the data on early - type galaxies seem to prefer isothermal models on the scales relevant to interpreting time delays , while constant @xmath4 models are firmly ruled out .",
    "if we must ultimately rely on the assumption that the density profiles of time delay lenses are similar to those of other early - type galaxies , the additional uncertainty added by this assumption will be small and calculable .",
    "moreover , the assumption is no different from the assumptions of homogeneity used in other studies of the distance scale .",
    "we can avoid any such assumptions by determining the density profiles of the time delay lenses directly .",
    "one approach is to measure the kinematic properties of the lens galaxy .",
    "since the mass inside the einstein ring is fixed by the image geometry , the velocity dispersion is controlled by the central concentration of the density .",
    "treu & koopmans ( 2002b ) apply this method to pg1115 + 080 and argue that the observed velocity dispersion requires a mass distribution between the isothermal and constant @xmath4 limits with @xmath184  .",
    "note , however , that with this velocity dispersion the lens galaxy does not lie on the fundamental plane , which is very peculiar .",
    "a second approach is to use deep infrared imaging to determine the structure of the lensed host galaxy of the quasar ( kochanek , keeton , & mcleod 2001 ) .",
    "the location and width of the einstein ring depends on both the radial and angular structure of the potential , although the sensitivity to the radial structure of the lens is weak when the annulus bracketing the lensed images is thin ( @xmath64 small ; saha & williams  2001 ) .",
    "this method will work best for asymmetric two - image lenses ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "the necessary data can be obtained with _ hst _  for most time delay lenses .",
    "we can also focus our monitoring campaigns on lenses already known to have well - constrained density profiles .",
    "for the reasons we have already discussed , systems with multi - component sources , well - studied images of the host galaxy or stellar dynamical measurements will have better constrained density profiles than those without any additional constraints .",
    "we can also avoid most of the uncertainties in the density profile by measuring the time delays of very low - redshift lenses .",
    "when the lens is very close to the observer , the images lie very close to the center of the lens where the stellar mass dominates .",
    "a constant @xmath4 model then becomes a very good approximation and we need worry little about the amount or the distribution of the dark matter .",
    "the one such candidate at present , q2237 + 0305 at @xmath186 , will have very short delays , but these could be measured by an x - ray monitoring program using the _ chandra _ observatory .",
    "finally , the statistical properties of larger samples of time delay lenses will also help to solve the problem .",
    "we already saw in  [ sec : results ] that the `` simple '' time delay lenses must have very similar densities , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this already means that the implications for @xmath0 no longer depend on individual lenses . in some ways",
    "the similarity of the densities is not an advantage  it is actually easier to determine @xmath0 if the density distributions are inhomogeneous ( kochanek  2003b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are well - defined approaches to using the statistical properties of lens models to estimate parameters that can not be determined from the models of the individual systems ( see kochanek  2001 ) .",
    "the statistics of the problematic flux ratios observed in the lenses ( see  [ sec : data ] ) may also provide a means of estimating @xmath1 .",
    "schechter & wambsganss  ( 2002 ) point out that in four - image quasar lenses there is a tendency for the brightest saddle point image to be demagnified compared to reasonable lens models .",
    "microlensing by the stars can naturally explain the observations if the surface density of stars is a small fraction of the total surface density near the images ( @xmath187 ) , which would rule out constant @xmath4 models where @xmath188 .",
    "the determination of @xmath0 using gravitational lens time delays has come of age .",
    "the last few years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of delay measurements , and there is no barrier other than sociology to rapidly increasing the sample .",
    "the interpretation of time delays requires a model for the gravitational potential of the lens .",
    "fortunately , the physics determining time delays is well understood , and the only important variable is the average surface density @xmath1 of the lens near the images for which the delay is measured .",
    "unfortunately , there is a tendency in the literature to conceal rather than to illuminate this understanding .",
    "provided a lens does not lie in a cluster where the cluster potential can not be described by a simple expansion , any lens model that includes the parameters needed to vary the average surface density of the lens near the images and to change the ratio between the quadrupole moment of the lens and the environment includes all the parameters needed to model time delays , to estimate the hubble constant , and to understand the systematic uncertainties in the results .",
    "_ all differences between estimates of the hubble constant for the simple time delay lenses can be understood on this basis .",
    "_    models for the four time delay lenses that can be modeled using a single lens galaxy predict that @xmath3   if the lens galaxies have isothermal density profiles with flat rotation curves , and @xmath189   if they have constant mass - to - light ratios .",
    "the key project estimate of @xmath7   agrees with the lensing results only if the lenses have little dark matter .",
    "we have strong theoretical prejudices and estimates from other observations of early - type galaxies that we should favor the isothermal models over the constant @xmath4 models .",
    "we feel that we have reached the point where the results from gravitational lens time delays deserve serious attention and that there is a reasonable likelihood that the local estimates of @xmath0 are too high .",
    "a modest investment of telescope time would allow the measurement of roughly 510 time delays per year , and these new delays would rapidly test the current results .",
    "other observations of time delay lenses to measure the velocity dispersions of the lens galaxies or to determine the geometry of the lensed images of the quasar host galaxy can be used to constrain the mass distributions directly .",
    "the systematic problems associated with the density profile are soluble not only in theory but also in practice , and the investment of the community s resources would be significantly less that than already invested in the distance scale .    the time delay measurements also provide a new probe of the density structure of galaxies at the boundary between the baryonic and dark matter dominated parts of galaxies ( projected distances of 12 effective radii ) .",
    "even if we ignore the actual value of @xmath0 , we can still study the differences in the surface densities .",
    "for example , we can show that the present sample of simple lenses must have very similar surface densities .",
    "this region is very difficult to study with other probes .",
    "finally , the time delay measurements can be used to determine cosmological parameters .",
    "time delays basically measure the distance to the lens galaxy , so we can make the same sorts of cosmological measurements as type ia supernovae .",
    "if the variations in @xmath1 between lens galaxies are small , as seem to be indicated by the present data , then the accuracy of the differential measurements will be very good .",
    "the present sample has little sensitivity to the cosmological model even with the mass distribution fixed because the time delay uncertainties are still too large and the redshift range is too restricted ( @xmath190 to @xmath191 ) .",
    "if we assume that other methods will determine the distance factors more accurately and rapidly , then we can use the time delays to study the evolution of galaxy mass distributions with redshift .",
