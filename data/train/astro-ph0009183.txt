    "circinus x1 ( cir x1 ) is one of the most enigmatic x  ray binary sources and shows a complex temporal and spectral behaviour . the earliest unambiguous x ",
    "ray detection was made by margon et _ al . _ ( 1971 ) .",
    "the position of the probable radio counterpart is located near the supernova remnant g321.90.3 ( clark , parkinson & caswell , 1975 ) , suggesting that cir x1 could be a runaway binary .",
    "the source displays a periodicity at radio ( whelan et _ al .",
    "_ , 1977 ) , ir ( glass , 1978 ) , optical ( moneti , 1992 ) and x  ray wavelengths ( kaluzienski et _ al .",
    "_ 1976 ) with a period of @xmath13 days .",
    "the high degree of stability of this period suggests that it is the orbital period .",
    "periodic radio flares near the zero phase ( for recent ephemeris see stewart et _ al . _ , 1991 ) of the orbital period are also accompanied by drastic changes in the x  ray light curve ( x  ray flares and dips ) .",
    "these variations can be explained in terms of a highly eccentric binary orbit , where the periastron , and consequently the increased mass transfer , occur near zero phase ( murdin et _ al .",
    "_ 1980 ) . shirey ( 1998 ) observed that the dipping activity of cir x1 occurs within 0.03 and 0.09 in the phase interval when the source enters its flaring state , after an increase of intensity in the x  ray light curve ( brandt et _ al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; shirey et _ al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "these dips might be explained by obscuration due to inhomogeneities in the mass transfer stream or intermittent bumps on the outer edge of the accretion disk ( shirey , 1998 ) .",
    "there is evidence of presence of radio jets from the source ( stewart et _ al .",
    "_ , 1993 ) .",
    "cir x1 shows a long - term variability in its luminosity .",
    "exosat observations show a gradual increase in the brightness of the source near zero phase from 1984 to 1986 , models involving the precession of the accretion disk , the thickening of the outer disk , or an apsidal motion have been proposed ( oosterbroek et _ al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) .",
    "the optical counterpart of cir x1 is a faint red star ( moneti , 1992 ) .",
    "the large ratio @xmath14 suggests that cir x1 is a low  mass x ",
    "ray binary ( lmxb ) . for a long time",
    "it was suspected that the compact object in cir x1 was a black hole , for the rapid variability similar to that of cyg x1 ( toor , 1977 ) .",
    "however the presence of a neutron star was demonstrated by the detection of type i x  ray burst ( tennant et _ al .",
    "_ , 1986 a , b ) .",
    "the spectral and fast timing properties of accreting low magnetic field neutron stars permit to distinguish them into two class , z and atoll sources , from the pattern each source describes in a x  ray color - color diagram ( hasinger & van der klis , 1989 ) .",
    "the z  sources are very bright and could have a moderate magnetic field , while the atoll  sources have a lower luminosity and probably a weaker magnetic field .",
    "it was not clear what kind of lmxb cir x1 is .",
    "oosterbroek et _ al . _",
    "( 1995 ) proposed that cir x1 may be an atoll  source with a magnetic field strength of less than @xmath15 gauss . using rxte data shirey ( 1998 ) identified much of the behaviour of cir x1 as that of a z  source : hardness - intensity diagrams showed that the track differs somewhat from the canonical z track , but the temporal behaviour of the source along the branches strongly suggests that cir x1 is a z  sources .",
    "the presence of horizontal ",
    "branch oscillations , in the range 120 hz , in the framework of the beat - frequency model ( alpar & shaman , 1985 ; lamb et _ al .",
    "_ , 1985 ) , could indicate a significant magnetic field .",
    "quasi periodic oscillations ( qpo ) at 100200 hz have been reported ( tennant , 1987 ; shirey et _ al . _ , 1996 ;",
    "shirey , 1998 ) , but no khz qpos were detected .",
    "the distance to cir x1 was estimated to be between 810 kpc ( goss & mebold , 1977 ) .",
    "recently , case & bhattacharya ( 1998 ) have revised the distance to the supernova remnant g321.9 - 0.3 , and hence to the associated cir x1 , to 5.5 kpc . in the following",
    "we adopt 5.5 kpc as the distance to the source , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the spectrum of cir x1 has been poorly understood up to now .",
    "asca data taken near the zero phase , at a low count rate , have been fitted with an absorbed two  blackbody model ( brandt et _ al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "an iron k edge at 7 kev was present , that corresponds to a large absorption column of @xmath9 @xmath10 and can be explained by a partial covering model .",
    "a weak emission line at 6.4 kev has also been detected .",
    "the edge and the gaussian emission line were no longer detected at higher count rate , above 300 c s@xmath2 ( brandt et _ al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "in a recent rxte observation ( shirey et _ al .",
    "_ , 1999a ) the spectrum of cir x1 was fitted using the eastern model ( mitsuda et _ al . _ , 1984 ) , i.e. a multicolor disk blackbody , with a temperature between 1.21.4 kev , and a blackbody with a temperature in the interval 1.92.4 kev .",
    "they found a peculiar feature , very prominent in the flaring branch , around 10 kev not easily understandable .",
    "this feature could be fitted with an absorption edge , but even a narrow line improved the fit .    here",
    "we report the results of a broad band ( 0.1100 kev ) spectral analysis performed on cir x1 data from the bepposax satellite .",
    "the broad energy coverage of bepposax narrow field instruments allows us to well constrain the spectrum of this source , and to detect the presence of a high energy component .",
    "the narrow field instruments ( nfi ) on board bepposax satellite ( boella et al .",
    "1997 ) observed cir x1 from 1998 august 1 15:59:54.5 ut , for a total time of 90 ks .",
    "the nfis are four co - aligned instruments which cover more than three decades of energy , from 0.1 kev up to 200 kev , with good spectral resolution in the whole range .",
    "lecs ( operating in the range 0.110 kev ) and mecs ( 111 kev ) have imaging capabilities with a field of view of @xmath16 and @xmath17 radius , respectively .",
    "we selected the data for scientific analysis in circular regions , centered on the source , of @xmath18 and @xmath19 radii for lecs and mecs respectively .",
    "the background subtraction was obtained using blank sky observations in which we extracted the background spectra in regions of the field of view similar to those used for the source .",
    "hpgspc ( 760 kev ) and pds ( 13200 kev ) have not imaging capabilities , because their field of views , of @xmath20 fwhm , are delimited by collimators .",
    "the background subtraction for these instruments is obtained using the off - source data accumulated during the rocking of the collimators .",
    "the energy ranges used in the spectral analysis are : 0.124 kev for lecs , 1.810.5 kev for mecs , 725 kev for hpgspc and 15100 kev for pds .",
    "lecs was only active in the time interval between @xmath21 s and @xmath22 s from the beginning of the observation .",
    "different normalizations of the nfis are considered by including in the model normalizing factors , fixed to 1 for mecs , and kept free for the other instruments .",
    "a systematic error of @xmath23 was added to the spectra . assuming the orbital ephemeris as reported by stewart et _ al . _",
    "( 1991 ) , we find that our observation covers the phase interval from 0.11 to 0.16 .    in figure 1",
    "we plotted the cir x1 light curve in the energy band 1.810 kev ( mecs data , upper panel ) , and the ratio of the count rate in the energy band 37 kev to that in the band 13 kev ( lower panel ) .",
    "no dips are present in the light curve .",
    "a flare that lasts @xmath0 s is present . the average count rate , out of the flare , is @xmath24 counts / s in the mecs , corresponding to an average hardness ratio of @xmath25 .",
    "the count rate increases during the flare , reaching @xmath26 counts / s at the peak , where the hardness ratio is @xmath27 .",
    "we also observe that the hardness ratio increases from the end of the flare to the end of the observation ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we plotted in figure 2 the color - color diagram ( hereafter ccd ) of the source using a bin time of 137 s. the variations are mainly due to the presence of the flare .",
    "the shape of this ccd is reminiscent of the flaring branch observed in the z  sources .",
    "we divided our observation in 8 intervals as reported in table 1 and in fig .",
    "the first five intervals are taken during the flare in order to study the rapid spectral variation .",
    "the last three intervals are taken out of the flare and correspond to different hard colors and positions in the ccd .    in table 1",
    "we show the flux of the source in the 2.525 kev energy range for all the intervals in order to compare these values with previous observations . in the same table",
    "we report the average observed flux of the source in the 0.1100 kev energy range , and the corresponding luminosity of the source .",
    "the lecs data are not always available ; in table 1 we report for which intervals lecs was active .",
    "as described above we extracted five spectra during the flare and three spectra during the persistent emission corresponding to different hard colors .",
    "the lecs was active only in two of the eight intervals ( see tab .",
    "1 ) . the average photoelectric absorption by cold matter , obtained fitting the spectra containing the low energy data , is @xmath28 @xmath10 .",
    "this parameter was fixed in the other intervals .",
    "a simple model , such as a blackbody or a disk multicolor blackbody , plus photoelectric absorption by cold matter , is not sufficient to fit the data .",
    "the spectra during the flare at higher count rate ( intervals from 2 to 4 ) and the soft part ( up to 10 kev ) of all the other spectra are well fitted by a comptonized model ( _ comptt _ , titarchuk 1994 ) , the comptonization of soft seed photons in a wien distribution by hot electrons .",
    "we obtained seed - photon and electronic temperatures of @xmath4 kev and @xmath27 kev , respectively , and both seem to increase during the flare ( see fig .",
    "the compton optical depth is around 17 for all the spectra .",
    "a blackbody plus a disk multicolor blackbody give equivalent fits .",
    "in this case we obtain a disk temperature of @xmath4 kev , similar to the seed photon temperature and a blackbody temperature of @xmath27 kev , corresponding to the electronic temperature of the comptonization model .",
    "the spectra at lower count rate ( intervals 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8) show a marked hard excess above 10 kev with respect to the previous models .",
    "the addition of a power law to the model improves the fit with very high statistical significance , although a thermal - bremsstrahlung component instead of the power law can not be excluded .",
    "the power - law component contributes to @xmath7 of the total luminosity and its photon index is between 3.17 and 3.37 .",
    "we also added the hard power - law component to the other spectra at high count rate ( intervals 2 , 3 , 4 ) , fixing the photon index to the average value 3.3 . in these cases ,",
    "the power - law component does not improve the fit , and we obtain an upper limit on the normalization . in table 2 and 3",
    "we report the result of the fits for all the intervals and the probability of chance improvement for the addition of a power law component .",
    "a feature between 8 and 10 kev is clearly visible in all the spectra and was also present in previous observations ( e.g. shirey et _ al .",
    "_ , 1999a ) .",
    "we add an edge at @xmath8 kev to fit this feature improving the fits with high statistical significance . in spectra 6 , 7 , 8",
    "the addition of an iron line improves furtherly the fit ( the addition is significant at a confidence level between 99.8% and 99.996% ) .",
    "the iron line energy is @xmath29 kev , with an upper limit for sigma of 0.24 and 0.47 kev ( spectra 6 and 7 respectively ) , and a sigma of 0.5 kev for spectrum 8 .",
    "we find that the equivalent widths are between 46 and 100 ev ( see table 3 ) . in figure 3",
    "we report the spectra and the residuals in units of @xmath30 with respect to the best fit model for intervals 4 ( at the peak of the flare ) and 6 ( out of the flare ) . in figure 4",
    "we report the unfolded spectrum for the same intervals shown in figure 3 .",
    "we analyzed data of cir x1 from a bepposax 90 ks observation in the energy range 0.1100 kev .",
    "the light curve shows a flare lasting @xmath31 s at the beginning of the observation and does not show dipping activity .",
    "the ccd of the source that we obtained is similar to the fb of a typical z  source , in line with rxte results ( shirey et _ al .",
    "_ , 1998 ; 1999a ) .",
    "the equivalent absorption column @xmath32 is @xmath33 @xmath10 , and is in agreement with previous observations ( brandt et _ al . _ , 1996 ) . for a distance to the source of 5.5 kpc ( case & bhattacharya , 1998 )",
    "the visual extinction in the direction of cir x1 is @xmath34 mag ( hakkila et al .",
    "1997 ) . using the observed correlation between visual extinction and absorption column ( predehl & schmitt 1995 )",
    "we find @xmath35 @xmath10 .",
    "it is slightly smaller than the value obtained from the fit , probably because of the presence of obscuring matter close to the x  ray source .",
    "a comptonized spectrum with an iron absorption edge are needed to fit the broad band energy spectra . for the spectra with lower count rate ( intervals 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8)",
    "the addition of an extra hard component is needed to fit the high energy range .",
    "the temperatures of the seed photons and the hot electrons of the comptonized component increase during the flare . in figure 5",
    "we plotted the two temperature versus the time ( centers of the corresponding temporal intervals ) .",
    "the optical depth of the comptonizing region is @xmath36 and does not seem to vary .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity of comptonized component is @xmath37 erg s@xmath2 during the persistent emission , and reaches @xmath38 erg s@xmath2 at the peak of the flare . in figure 6",
    "we report the electronic temperature versus the seed - photon temperature .",
    "a linear correlation between the two temperatures is evident , with a slope of @xmath39 .",
    "this correlation could indicate a sort of equilibrium between the two temperatures , because an increase of the seed - photon temperature corresponds to an increase of the electron temperature .",
    "the comptonizing region is probably located in the inner part of the system , covering part of the accretion disk , where the seed photons could originates .",
    "an eastern model ( blackbody plus multicolor disk blackbody ) instead of a comptonized model also fits well the data .",
    "the inner radius of the disk that we obtain in this case is @xmath40 km , assuming an inclination angle of @xmath41 , similar to the radius of the seed photons obtained from the previous model ( see below ) . on the other hand",
    "the radius of @xmath42 km obtained from the blackbody is quite large to be identified with the neutron star radius .",
    "it is possible that the blackbody mimics the wien law of the comptt model . because the comptt model seems more reasonable",
    "we adopt this interpretation .      for each interval we calculated the radius of the seed - photon wien spectrum , @xmath12 , using the parameters reported in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "following in t zand et _ al . _",
    "( 1999 ) this radius can be expressed as @xmath44 km , where @xmath45 is the distance to the source in kpc , @xmath46 is the unabsorbed flux of the comptt model in erg @xmath10 s@xmath2 , @xmath47 is the seed photon temperature in kev , and @xmath48 is the relative energy gain due to the comptonization .",
    "we obtain that the seed - photon radius is @xmath49 km .",
    "an hypothesis is that this is the inner radius of the accretion disk .",
    "it is quite large but we observe that a large inner disk radius is in agreement with the absence of khz qpos in the power spectrum density of cir x1 ( shirey et _ al . _ , 1996 ) .",
    "in fact khz qpos are usually explained as the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the disk , near the neutron star surface ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ; stella & vietri 1999 ; titarchuk , lapidus , & muslimov 1998 ) . the lack of khz frequencies in the power spectra of cir x1 could mean that the inner region of the disk is not present .",
    "a possible explanation of the large value of the inner radius is that the compact object presents a magnetic field sufficiently strong to obtain a magnetosphere around the neutron star , although in this case we need to suppose a particular geometrical configuration in order to avoid the unobserved coherent pulsations .",
    "the relation between the magnetospheric radius @xmath50 and the magnetic field strength is @xmath51 km ( see e.g. burderi et _ al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) , where @xmath52 is a correction factor for the alfven radius when an accretion disk is present ( ghosh & lamb , 1991 ) , @xmath53 is the magnetic moment in units of @xmath54 g @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the neutron star radius , @xmath57 , in units of @xmath58 cm , @xmath59 is the ratio between the observed luminosity and the total gravitational potential energy released per second by the accreting matter , @xmath60 is the neutron star mass in unit of solar mass . adopting @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( typical for a neutron star ) , @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the intrinsic luminosity of the comptonized component in units of @xmath65 erg s@xmath2 , and @xmath66 we can find a magnetic field strength for each interval",
    ". the obtained values are consistent with an average magnetic field of @xmath43 gauss .",
    "this value is slightly higher than the typical magnetic field strength inferred for the z  sources .",
    "another possibility to explain the large inner radius of the accretion disk is that the inner region of the disk is hidden for the presence of optically thick material ( e.g. the comptonized region with compton optical depth @xmath36 ) in the central part of the system .",
    "a hard component is required to fit the spectra at low luminosity ( 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8) . during the flare the hard component",
    "is not detected with statistical significance ( see tab .",
    "3 , where the upper limit for the normalization is reported ) .",
    "a similar hard component has also been observed in ginga data of gx 51 ( asai et _ al .",
    "_ , 1994 ) , in bepposax data of gx 17 + 2 ( di salvo et _ al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) and in bepposax data of gx 349 + 2 ( di salvo _ al .",
    "_ , 2000b ) .",
    "asai et _ al . _",
    "( 1994 ) observed gx 51 in the normal branch ( nb ) and in the flaring branch ( fb ) of the relative z - track ; the intensity of the power - law component decreases from the nb to the fb .",
    "di salvo et _ al . _ ( 2000 ) observed gx 17 + 2 in the horizontal branch ( hb ) and in the nb , and the intensity of the power - law component was found to decrease toward the nb / fb vertex .",
    "in cir x1 the intensity of the power - law component decreases from the nb / fb vertex toward the fb .",
    "the hard excess could have a non thermal origin , due to scattering of soft photons by electrons with a non thermal distribution of velocities .",
    "these electrons could be part of a jet .",
    "in fact stewart et _ al . _",
    "( 1993 ) detected the presence of a jet with a maximum at the phase 0.17 where the flux increased up to 12 mjy and an upper limit on the 12-h integrated flux density of @xmath67 mjy .",
    "the angle between the jet and the line of sight is @xmath68 ( stewart et _ al .",
    "_ , 1993 ; fender et _",
    "al . _ , 1998 ) .",
    "our observation is in the phase interval 0.110.16 , near the observed maximum of the radio flux .",
    "so , a jet could be the origin of the power law observed in cir x1 , and similarly in gx 51 and gx 17 + 2 .",
    "these sources , as well as all the z  sources , have been associated with variable radio sources ( fender & hendry 2000 , and reference therein ) .",
    "note that these hard component might be a general feature of the z - sources and this is another feature that cir x1 shares with the z  source family .",
    "an absorption edge at @xmath8 kev is present in all the spectra , and a gaussian emission line at @xmath29 kev is detected in the spectra 6 , 7 and 8 ( see tab . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the energy of the emission line is compatible with the iron ionization levels fe xxiii ",
    "xxv indicated by the absorption edge energy ( see turner et _ al . _ , 1992 for a correspondence between iron edge energy and ionization level ) .",
    "the best fit value for the optical depth @xmath69 , considering the photoionization cross section for the k  shell fe xxiii ( krolik & kallman , 1987 ) , corresponds to a hydrogen column density of @xmath70 @xmath10 , assuming a cosmic abundance of iron .",
    "this is much higher than the measured photoelectric absorption ( see tab . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this could imply the existence of a highly ionized region around the compact object , producing the absorption edge and not contributing to the photoelectric absorption .",
    "in asca observations brandt et _ al . _",
    "( 1996 ) observed an iron edge at @xmath71 kev . to explain the presence of this edge they discussed that a poorly ionized torus could be present around the neutron star , finding the relative covering fraction of @xmath72 when the absorbed flux was @xmath73 erg @xmath10 s@xmath2 ( low state ) .",
    "when the absorbed flux was @xmath74 erg @xmath10 s@xmath2 ( high state ) , the partial covering and the edge at 7 kev were no longer detected .",
    "their measures of the galactic n@xmath75 , @xmath76 @xmath10 , and the partial covering n@xmath75 , @xmath70 @xmath10 , are in agreement with our results .",

    "( 1999a ) .",
    "the torus of matter around cir x1 could be a deformation of the outer region of the accretion disk due to the tidal interaction between the two stars of the binary system and to the high mass transfer from the donor star .",
    "when cir x1 is in a low state the torus is poorly ionized , and it partially absorbs the spectrum , and an edge from neutral iron and a fluorescence line at 6.4 kev are present . when cir x1 is in a high state the torus could be photoionized , it is not necessary to use a partial covering to fit the data , an emission line at 6.7 kev is present and the absorption edge is shifted to higher energies .",
    "the angle between the jet and the line of sight is probably @xmath78 ( fender et _ al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "assuming that the direction of the jet is perpendicular to the plane of the disk then the angle between the plane of the disk and the line of sight is @xmath79 .",
    "this could support the hypothesis that the line of sight intercepts the torus .    in the hypothesis",
