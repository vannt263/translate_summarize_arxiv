[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath50 value is closer to the 2d xy than the 3d models although the ordering is suggested to be a 3d order from the powder neutron diffraction measurements.@xcite we suggest that our data are not sufficiently close to @xmath14 to reflect 3d critical behavior.@xcite it is to be noted that the longitudinal @xmath41sr relaxation rate above @xmath14 in pb@xmath2vo(po@xmath3)@xmath2 has been fitted well by this 2d xy model.@xcite a tiny in - plane anisotropy can dominate the fluctuations if the dominant af correlation length is large.@xcite in the present case , @xmath51 above @xmath14 is approximately isotropic , but it is possible that there might be a small anisotropy which is not visible in the experimental @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , strong in - plane correlation may also enhance 3d coupling along the @xmath15-direction.@xcite therefore to understand this issue , a precise estimation of in - plane spin anisotropy is required .",
    "it is useful to compare our data with data for other layered compounds .",
    "a similar reduced value of @xmath50 close to the @xmath50 for the 2d ising model has been observed before in several layered compounds , e.g. , k@xmath2nif@xmath3 , k@xmath2mnf@xmath3 , k@xmath2cof@xmath3 , rb@xmath2mnf@xmath3 , and rbcof@xmath3 ( ref .  ) . in these compounds",
    "the weak ising - type anisotropy is about two orders of magnitude larger than the interplanar coupling .",
    "therefore it is argued that the long - range ordering is primarily induced by the strong anisotropy crossover from 2d heisenberg to 2d ising behavior , which precedes the 2d ising to 3d ising crossover that should occur close to @xmath14 . since the onset of such 3d ordering is still governed by the 2d processes , the phase boundaries that are observed should reflect the underlying 2d character . whenever there is a 3d ordering , one must have 3d correlations sufficiently close to @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , in bani@xmath2(po@xmath3)@xmath2 , an exponent ( @xmath52 ) close to 3d model was found near @xmath14 and another exponent ( @xmath53 ) close to that of the 2d xy model was found a little bit away from @xmath14 ( see p.  281 of ref .  ) . however , in some cases this 3d critical region is over such a narrow temperature range that it is not accessible experimentally .",
    "such a scenario has been realized before in the frustrated antiferromagnetic square lattice compound li@xmath2vosio@xmath3 . in this compound ,",
    "neutron powder - diffraction experiments show that the ordering is 3d and the antiferromagnetic @xmath16-layers are coupled ferromagnetically along the @xmath15-axis.@xcite in contrast , a reduced value of @xmath50 close to the @xmath50 value of the 2d xy model has been reported from nmr measurements and the authors suggested that the transition to the columnar phase might be driven by the xy anisotropy.@xcite although our experimental observations below @xmath14 are similar to those reported for li@xmath2vosio@xmath3 , a proper explanation for this peculiar behavior is still lacking in all these vanadates .",
    "therefore further experiments on high quality single crystalline materials are essential to address this issue .",
    "we performed @xmath5p nmr measurements on pb@xmath2vo(po@xmath3)@xmath2 , which is a strongly frustrated 2d heisenberg square lattice compound .",
    "the exchange couplings were estimated reliably from @xmath54 analysis to be @xmath55  k and @xmath56  k. from the nmr spectral measurements , the ground state was detected to be columnar antiferromagnetic ( caf ) type and is consistent with that expected from the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ) for @xmath57 .",
    "the hyperfine coupling and @xmath7 above @xmath14 are consistent with the distortion of the v@xmath0 squares due to monoclinic crystal symmetry .",
    "we have measured the temperature dependence of the sublattice magnetization in the caf ordered state from the line splitting .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath50 estimated from the sublattice magnetization was close to the value predicted for a 2d xy model .",
    "we did not observe any signature of magnetic / structural disorder in contrast to the neutron scattering and @xmath41sr experiments on powder samples.@xcite to gain more insight , further complementary experiments on single crystals are required . due to the low energy scale of the exchange interactions ,",
    "this compound is also a potential candidate for high - field experiments , and for high - pressure experiments where one can tune the exchange couplings .",

    "<S> the nmr spectrum for the p1 site splits into two satellites and the spacing between them increases monotonically with decreasing @xmath10 which is a direct evidence of a columnar antiferromagnetic ordering with spins lying in the @xmath16-plane . </S>",
    "<S> this type of magnetic ordering is consistent with expectation from the @xmath17 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponent @xmath18 estimated from the temperature dependence of the sublattice magnetization as measured by @xmath5p nmr at 11.13  mhz is close to the value ( 0.231 ) predicted for the two - dimensional xy model . </S>"
