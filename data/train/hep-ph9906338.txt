    "in this talk , we will discuss high - order corrections to heavy quark production in qcd . to get a better confidence in our ability to predict cross sections for various heavy quark reactions , including open flavor and quarkonia production ,",
    "we need to gain control over a class of corrections associated with what is sometimes called partonic threshold . this talk will describe the nature of these corrections , and report on the progress of the past few years @xcite in their resummation to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "corrections due to resummation may turn out to be small , in which case our confidence in low - order perturbative cross sections should increase , or , they may turn out to be large , and may afford sensitivity to qcd dynamics in a regime where all orders of perturbation theory are relevant .",
    "it is possible that both scenarios apply in different cross sections , and/or in different kinematic ranges of the same cross section .",
    "inclusive heavy quark production is just one example of a qcd process at large momentum transfer",
    ". we may consider the class of cross sections in which we sum over all final states that include any heavy system @xmath2 , which can only be produced by a short - distance process in partonic scattering .",
    "suppose for simplicity that the total mass @xmath3 of the system @xmath4 is of order @xmath5 , the total ( hadronic ) center of mass energy , and that the rapidity @xmath6 of the produced system is not a large parameter .",
    "such a cross section can be expressed to leading power by the factorized expression & = & _ ab _",
    "q^2/s^1dz _ a / a(x_a,^2 ) _ b / b(x_b,^2 ) + &  & ( z - q^2 x_ax_bs ) _ abfx(z , e^-2yx_ax_b , q , q , _",

    "[ cutcross ] . the @xmath7 s",
    "are parton distributions ( in some factorization scheme , like dis or @xmath8 ) , while @xmath9 is a partonic hard - scattering function , which at lowest order is the born cross section for @xmath10 , = _",
    "born+_s^(1 ) +  . [ sigmaborn ] these relations",
    "may be written down for both unpolarized and polarized cross sections .",
    "corrections in either case are power - suppressed @xcite ; beginning at @xmath11 for unpolarized or longitudinally polarized cross sections , and at @xmath12 for transversely polarized cross sections .    in eq .",
    "( [ basicfact ] ) , the limit @xmath13 is associated with corrections that tend to enhance the cross section .",
    "these enhancements are the object of threshold resummation .",
    "we will discuss below the origin of this terminology , why such corrections can sometimes be large , and how they can be resummed to all orders .",
    "much of the following discussion follows ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the partonic process require that @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 in eq .  ( [ basicfact ] ) . at @xmath16 ,",
    "the partons have just enough energy to produce the observed final state , with no extra hadronic radiation .",
    "this is what we shall refer to as the elastic limit @xcite , or partonic threshold .",
    "it is important to distinguish partonic threshold from the usual concept of a threshold . in particular , in heavy quark production , we shall assume that the heavy quarks of mass @xmath17 are produced with nonzero velocity @xmath18 , and hence with a total invariant mass @xmath19 .",
    "thus , only for @xmath20 does partonic threshold coincide with true threshold . for the drell - yan production of highly relativistic lepton pairs with @xmath21 ,",
    "partonic threshold still refers to @xmath16 , and is a source of potentially large corrections .",
    "typical hard - scattering cross sections @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ basicfact ] ) are distributions in the variable @xmath23 rather than simply functions of @xmath23 , because they include contributions from virtual as well as real gluons .",
    "we are interested in a class of potentially large , positive corrections due to such distributions , which occur in all @xmath24 .",
    "we next explain in what sense they are ",
    "large \" , and why they are positive to all orders .    at order @xmath25 , the leading logarithmic distributions in eq.([basicfact ] ) are of the form ( suppressing color factors , which depend on parton type ) -_s^nn ! _ + , [ lln ] whose integral with a smooth function @xmath26 ( such as the convolution of parton distributions in eq .",

    "it is evident that such terms give , at least formally , contributions that grow even faster than @xmath27 at @xmath28th order .",
    "if they had alternating signs , these contributions might add up to a finite number somehow , but they are all of the same sign .    the signs in eq .",

    "this is the ratio of the moment of a physical cross section to a product of moments of parton distributions . because @xmath9 is , by construction , dependent only on short - distance behavior ,",
    "the ratio may be computed in perturbation theory , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ mtratio ] ( for the dis scheme ) .",
    "the numerator is a moment of the perturbative partonic drell - yan cross section , while the denominator is the product of moments of two perturbative parton distributions . for quark - antiquark processes ,",
    "the parton distributions are the same , so the denominator is the square of squared partonic amplitudes , summed over final states .    at each order , both the numerator and denominator in fig .",

    "after moments , both give double - logarithmic @xmath38 at @xmath28th order , with @xmath39 the moment variable .",
    "these leading logarithms are the finite remainders of corrections from @xmath28 pairs of real and virtual gluons that attach to the scattered quarks in dis and the annihilating pair in dy . in the denominator ,",
    "each dis parton distribution , which is itself of the form of a cross section , has both incoming _ and _ outgoing quarks , while in the numerator , dy involves incoming quarks only .    on physical grounds ,",
    "the numerator must vanish as @xmath40 and the denominator must vanish as @xmath41 .",
    "the reason for this may be seen by recalling the relations of @xmath23 and @xmath36 to the invariant mass @xmath42 of hadrons in the final state for the two cases : & : & w^2q^2(1-z)^2 , + dis & : & w^2~q^2(1-x)/x .",
    "[ wsquared ] the limits @xmath40 and @xmath41 thus both correspond to nearly elastic scattering @xcite : for drell - yan , the annihilation of a quark pair into an electroweak vector boson , for dis , the scattering of a quark into a nearly massless jet of particles .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that in these limits , the partonic cross section is suppressed @xcite . indeed , in these limits , we expect the coherent scattering of hadronic bound states , whose contributions are normally suppressed by a power of @xmath3 compared to incoherent partonic scattering , to dominate @xcite .",
    "the outgoing quarks give an extra suppression in dis when the hard - scattering function @xmath9 , fig .",
    "[ mtratio ] , is computed in perturbation theory .",
    "that is , the product of dis denominators is suppressed even more than the single dy numerator .",
    "then the ratio grows with moment @xmath39 , from the elastic limit in @xmath23 space .",
    "this is the source of the terms shown in eq .",
    "( [ lln ] ) in @xmath9 , and is the reason why they all have the same sign .",
    "the drell - yan cross section is the benchmark for the resummation of singular distributions .",

    "[ dyexponent ] the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are finite series in @xmath43 @xcite , given for @xmath8 by g_1(_s)= 2c_f ( _ s + 12k ( _ s)^2)+  , g_2(_s ) = o(_s^2 ) , [ g12def ] where @xcite k = c_a(6718-^26 ) -59n_f .",
    "( [ dyexp ] ) and ( [ dyexponent ] ) resum all logarithms of @xmath39 in the sense of an order - by - order expansion , by reexpanding the running couplings in terms of @xmath43 .",
    "the resummed integrals , however , are ill - defined for @xmath41 , no matter how large @xmath49 is , since the perturbative running coupling diverges at @xmath50 .",
    "such a divergence is sometimes called an infrared renormalon , and may give hints on the structure of power corrections to eq .",
    "( [ basicfact ] ) .",
    "most importantly , it is possible to regulate the singularity in the running coupling without affecting the leading power behavior of the resummed cross section @xcite .",
    "different approaches to this problem can give somewhat different predictions @xcite , but in any reasonable prescription the threshold corrections remain relatively modest , although nonnegligible in at least some physically relevant regions .    it has been noted in several phenomenological applications that threshold resummation , and even fixed - order expansions based upon it , significantly reduces sensitivity to the factorization scale @xcite .",
    "the reason for this reduction is easy to see in the dependence on the factorization scale , @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ dyexponent ] ) .",

    "is exactly the coefficient of @xmath53 in @xmath54 .",
    "because resummation matches phase space to all orders at partonic threshold @xcite , all associated factorization scale dependence is also matched . to be specific , we may write the moments of the drell - yan cross section in a form that resums the singular threshold distributions , ^dy_ab(n , q ) & = & _ q _ q / a(n , ) _ q|q^dy(n , q , ) _",

    "these factors compensate for the singular part of the evolution of the parton distributions , and the @xmath51-dependence of the resummed expression is suppressed by a power of the moment variable , = o(1/ n ) .",
    "of course , the importance of the remaining sensitivity to @xmath51 depends on the kinematics .",
    "beyond leading logarithms , there are important differences between the electro - weak - induced drell yan cross sections and the qcd - induced top or jet cross sections .",
    "these are due primarily to the presence of final - state radiation from scattered quarks in the latter case , which is absent in the former , and to the interplay of color exchange in the hard scattering with the soft radiation . as in the case of eq .",
    "( [ dyexp ] ) , resummation is based first of all on the factorization properties of the cross section in the neighborhood of the elastic limit @xcite .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hs ] . near the elastic limit ,",
    "all gluons emitted into the final state have energies limited by @xmath56 .",
    "correspondingly , gluons with energies of order @xmath3 can appear only in virtual diagrams .",
    "standard factorization methods may then be used to separate the relatively soft but still perturbative gluons from the underlying hard scattering .",
    "this may be done order - by - order in perturbation theory , keeping both the hard and soft factors of @xmath9 free of soft and collinear divergences .",
    "the process of factorization may be thought of as the construction of an effective field theory for soft gluons in the presence of the hard scattering @xcite .    in the relevant effective field theory , the incoming partons that annihilate into the heavy quarks and the outgoing heavy quarks themselves",
