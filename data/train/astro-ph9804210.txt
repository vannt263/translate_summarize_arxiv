    "one surprising discovery uncovered by the _",
    "observatory was that elliptical and s0 galaxies are relatively bright , extended x - ray sources ( e.g. , forman et al .  1979 ; forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ; trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ) .",
    "it soon was established that the source of these x - rays was thermal emission from hot ( @xmath31 kev ) , diffuse interstellar gas , at least for the brighter x - ray early - type galaxies .",
    "however , several unsolved problems still remain concerning the x - ray emission from elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "although there is a strong correlation between the x - ray and blue luminosities in these systems , the x - ray luminosity can vary by as much as a factor of @xmath4 among galaxies with the same blue luminosity ( canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1987 ; fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "ellipticals and s0s with a low x - ray  to  blue luminosity ratio ( @xmath1 ) also have different spectral characteristics than their x - ray bright ( high @xmath1 ) counterparts . from _ einstein _",
    "observations , kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri ( 1992 ) found that the galaxies with the lowest @xmath1 exhibited an excess of very soft x - ray emission .",
    "_ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) observations of several x - ray faint galaxies have confirmed that the x - ray emission in such galaxies is not characterized by emission from hot , metal - enriched gas with a temperature of @xmath31 kev ; a two component model , in which one component has a temperature around 0.2 kev and the other a temperature greater than a few kev provides a better fit ( fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1994 ; pellegrini 1994 ) .",
    "this result was confirmed by an _",
    "observation of ngc  4382 ( kim et al .",
    "the source of the soft @xmath30.2 kev emission has been postulated to be rs cvn binary systems , m star coronae , supersoft sources , or a low temperature interstellar medium ( ism ) , although none of these mechanisms seems to be entirely responsible for the soft x - ray emission ( pellegrini & fabbiano 1994 ) .",
    "the hard component is thought to be emission from accreting compact x - ray binaries ; this is the dominant x - ray component in most spiral galaxies ( trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ) .",
    "it is difficult to do detailed spectral modeling of these low @xmath1 systems because of their low x - ray count rates , even for the closest and brightest examples . instead ,",
    "in this paper we will analyze the broad band x - ray ",
    "colors \" of elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "these `` colors '' are the ratios of the counts in three x - ray bands . whereas conventional spectral fitting requires a minimum of about 1000 counts to constrain reasonably the parameters of the model , only about 100 counts are needed to determine the x - ray colors .",
    "this allows much fainter x - ray galaxies to be analyzed and compared to brighter galaxies , leading to a more comprehensive investigation into the x - ray properties of early - type galaxies .",
    "a similar technique of determining colors was used to study a large sample of x - ray galaxies with _ einstein _ data by kim et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . in this paper",
    ", we will determine the x - ray colors of early - type galaxies observed with the _ rosat _ pspc .",
    "the increased sensitivity of _ rosat _ over _ einstein _ allows a larger sample to be analyzed and the x - ray colors to be determined more accurately .",
    "in addition to integrated x - ray colors , we also derive the x - ray colors as a function of galactocentric radius to explore the variation of x - ray emission with position .",
    "if the emission mechanisms are different between x - ray faint and x - ray bright elliptical and s0 galaxies , the integrated colors and color profiles should shed some light on this difference .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : galsamp ] , we define our galaxy sample and give the relevant properties of the galaxies , and in   [ sec : datared ] , we discuss the data analysis .",

    "in order to create an unbiased galaxy sample , we screened all the galaxies in the _ third revised catalog of galaxies _ ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) according to de vaucouleurs t - type ( t @xmath5 ) and corrected blue apparent magnitude ( @xmath6 ) . using _",
    "heasarc browse _",
    ", we determined which galaxies were observed with the _ rosat _ pspc and available in the public archive . since both the sensitivity and resolution of the pspc decrease appreciably outside the rib support structure , we only include galaxies which are contained within the inner edge of the rib ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "furthermore , we excluded all galaxies with galactic column densities above @xmath8 @xmath9 , since soft x - rays are very heavily absorbed at high hydrogen column densities .",
    "we excluded galaxies that are at the center of rich clusters , since the x - ray emission from these galaxies is contaminated by emission from hot intracluster gas known to be present in such systems .",
    "finally , galaxies deeply buried    8.00truein    [ tab : galsamp ]    in the x - ray halo of another bright galaxy , or unresolved from another x - ray source , or whose x - ray emission was clearly point - like , or which contained an active galactic nucleus according to _ quasars and active galactic nuclei _ ( 7th edition ; veron - cetty & veron  1996 ) were excluded .",
    "these selection criteria yielded a total of 61 galaxies , whose properties are listed in table  [ tab : galsamp ] .",
    "the values for the blue total apparent magnitude @xmath10 were taken from de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the galactic hydrogen column density to each galaxy is from stark et al .",
    "the distances to the galaxies are also listed in table  [ tab : galsamp ] . for most of the galaxies",
    ", distances were taken from faber et al .",
    "( 1989 ) ; the remaining distances were taken from tully ( 1988 ) .",
    "the sole exception was eso185 - 54 , which did not appear in either of the above sources .",
    "its distance was taken from sadler , jenkins , & kotanyi ( 1989 ) .",
    "we have assumed a hubble constant of @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "all the data were initially processed using snowden s ( 1995 ) routines in order to correct for particle and scattered solar x - ray background , and for exposure and vignetting .",
    "periods of high background due to charged particles were removed by filtering the data such that all time intervals with a master veto rate above 170 counts s@xmath12 were excluded . for each data set ,",
    "three images were created by combining pairs of the seven energy band images produced by the snowden ( 1995 ) routines as follows : r1l + r2 ( approximately @xmath13 kev ) , r4 + r5 ( approximately @xmath14 kev ) , and r6 + r7 ( approximately @xmath15 kev ) .",
    "snowden s r3 band is located in the carbon absorption edge of the detector , is poorly calibrated , and contains little independent spectral information .",
    "nearly all the data were taken in the post - gain change mode ( 1991 october 11 ) . however , any data taken before the gain change were analyzed in the low gain bandpass ( r1l ) for consistency .    for each of the three energy bands , counts were extracted from concentric annular apertures @xmath16 in width centered on the peak of x - ray emission for each galaxy .",
    "unrelated x - ray sources within the field of view were identified by eye and removed from the data . in most cases ,",
    "background counts were obtained from an annular region @xmath17 in extent , and were normalized to and subtracted from each source . after subtracting background , the radial surface brightness profile of the galaxies at large radii fluctuated around zero .",
    "this provides evidence that the snowden ( 1995 ) routines do a good job of correcting for exposure , vignetting , and non - x - ray background . in cases where the galaxy of interest was on the outskirts of another galactic x - ray halo , a local background had to be carefully chosen .",
    "again , a surface brightness profile which fluctuated around zero at large distances from the source confirmed the suitability of our background region selection .",
    "next , we define our two x - ray colors as @xmath18 and @xmath19 although similar in spirit to the x - ray colors used by kim et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for _ einstein _ data , the colors in these two studies are not directly comparable , because of the different photon energy bandpasses and different responses of _ einstein _ and _",
    "rosat_.    for a given emission spectrum , the observed c21 ( and , to a lesser extent , c32 ) color depends significantly on the amount of absorption due to galactic hydrogen along the line of sight to the galaxy .",
    "we developed a technique to correct the colors for absorption , based on the detailed spectral response of the _ rosat _ pspc . to calibrate the absorption corrections , we first determined the emitted colors ( c21 and c32 ) and the observed colors ( c21@xmath20 and c32@xmath20 ) for an extensive grid of raymond - smith ( 1977 ) thermal models with varying abundances ( ranging from 20% to 100% of solar ) and temperatures ( ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 kev ) , and subject to different values for the amount of foreground absorption .",
    "the absorbing hydrogen columns considered ranged from @xmath21 to @xmath8 @xmath9 ; the upper limit corresponds to the upper limit allowed for inclusion in our sample (   [ sec : galsamp ] ) .",
    "the spectral models were folded through the spectral response of the pspc using the xspec program .",
    "we assumed that the unabsorbed colors ( c21 , c32 ) could be related to the absorbed colors ( c21@xmath20 , c32@xmath20 ) through relations of the form @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are functions of the galactic column density @xmath26 . in equations ( [ eq : c21cor ] ) and ( [ eq : c32cor ] ) , the terms with the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 would represent simple exponential absorption if the spectral bands used were infinitely narrow .",
    "the term with the coefficient @xmath29 includes the effect of the spectral distribution of photons within the bands ( as parameterized by the color ) on the effective optical depth .",
    "for the harder c32 color , this additional correction was unnecessary .",
    "the absorbed colors from our grid of spectral models and absorptions were compared to those expected from the correction equations ( [ eq : c21cor ] ) and ( [ eq : c32cor ] ) . a number of simple forms for the correction coefficient functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 were tried .",
    "empirically , the following functions were found to work well .",

    "the rms errors became substantially larger when models with hydrogen column densities greater than @xmath8 @xmath9 were included in the calculation of the correction coefficient functions .",
    "it is for this reason that we have excluded all galaxies with column densities above @xmath8 @xmath9 from our sample . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will refer to the absorption - corrected colors as c21 and c32 .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to study the differing x - ray emission mechanisms in galaxies with differing x - ray luminosities .",
    "x - ray luminosities from the _ einstein _ observatory are available for many of our galaxies . however , for consistency with the spectral properties derived from the _ rosat _ pspc data , we also derived x - ray luminosities from the same data .",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath33 of each galaxy was determined for band 1 ( @xmath13 kev ; the `` soft '' s band ) , and for bands 2 and 3 combined ( @xmath34 kev ; the `` hard '' h band ) . the count rates for these bands were converted to physical fluxes and luminosities assuming that the emission spectrum was a raymond - smith thermal model with a temperature of 0.8 kev and an abundance of 0.5 solar , using separate model normalizations for hard and soft bands .",
    "the fluxes are not strongly dependent on the emission spectrum assumed .",
    "the fluxes were corrected for intervening absorption , based on the galactic hydrogen column toward the galaxy ( table  [ tab : galsamp ] ) . for consistency ,",
    "the luminosities were all determined for a circular aperture whose radius was five optical effective radii . the effective radius of each galaxy @xmath35 , which contains one - half of the projected optical luminosity of the galaxy , was taken from de vaucouleurs et al .",

    "rather , we use this model to better compare to the results of previous spectral fits to early - type galaxies , which employ the raymond - smith model ( e.g. , fabbiano et al .  1994 ) .    we first attempted to fit the spectrum with a one component raymond - smith model with variable abundance and galactic absorption .",

    "1994 ; kim et al .  1996 ) . however , as was the case for the x - ray faint galaxies , this is not a plausible model for the integrated emission from lmxbs , because it lacks the very hard component seen in these objects individually and in the _ asca _ spectra of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the temperature derived for this model is significantly less than the value determined by _ einstein _ using a bremsstrahlung model , although an absorbing column density less than the galactic value was found to yield the best fit to the _ einstein _ data ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1987 ) , whereas we have fixed the column density at the galactic value .",
    "next , a two component raymond - smith model with abundances fixed at solar was used to fit the spectra .",
    "the fit was unacceptable , with @xmath49 for 99 degrees of freedom .",
    "the best - fit parameters were @xmath50 kev and @xmath51 kev .",
    "this is remarkably similar to the values obtained from the spectra of x - ray faint galaxies .",
    "however , unlike the x - ray faint galaxies , the observation of m31 contained enough counts to rule out this model .",
    "we find that a vast improvement is made in the fit if we allow the abundance of the soft component to vary .",
    "doing so reduces @xmath52 to 100.5 for 98 degrees of freedom .",
    "the soft component temperature was found to be @xmath53 kev ( @xmath54 kev ) with an abundance of @xmath55 of solar , and the hard component temperature was @xmath56 kev ( all errors are quoted at the 90% confidence level ) .    due to the very low abundance of the soft component , we hesitate to attach a physical significance to this two component model for the x - ray emission from lmxbs .",
    "nonetheless , the observations do show that a soft component should be expected from the integrated emission from lmxbs in an old stellar population .",
    "one does not need to invoke a separate class of x - ray  emitting objects to account for the soft x - ray emission in x - ray faint ellipticals , especially for the faintest of the group 1 galaxies whose x - ray colors and @xmath1 ratios are fully consistent with those of the bulge of m31 .",

    "we have also calculated the x - ray colors of the bulge of the bright sa galaxy ngc  1291 to verify the results found for m31 .",
    "we have assumed an integrated blue magnitude of 10.73 within an effective radius of @xmath57 ( 3.2 kpc at a distance of 13.8 mpc ; de vaucouleurs 1975 ) for this galaxy . after correcting for absorption ( @xmath58 @xmath9 ) ,",
    "we derive integrated colors of ( c21 , c32@xmath59 .",
    "these values are virtually identical to those obtained for m31 .",
    "we also found that @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the bulge of ngc  1291 .",
    "these values are somewhat higher than those which were found for m31 , but still within the range of observed values for x - ray faint galaxies . a spectral fit of the bulge of ngc  1291 was performed by bregman , hogg , & roberts ( 1995 ) .",
    "they found that a two component raymond - smith model with abundances fixed at solar provided a good fit to the data , and yielded temperature values of @xmath62 kev and @xmath63 kev .",
    "these values are consistent with the temperatures derived for the bulge of m31 using an identical spectral model ( see model 2 in table  [ tab : m31 ] ) .",
    "although this model did not provide an adequate fit to the spectra of m31 , the observation of ngc  1291 contained only one - third the number of counts of the m31 observation , so it is not surprising that solar abundances could not be be ruled out for the soft component of ngc  1291 .",
    "obviously , such a soft component in the x - ray emission from lmxbs should be readily observable in galactic lmxbs , if it were not for the fact that nearly all the lmxbs in our galaxy lie in directions of high hydrogen column densities , because they are concentrated to the central regions of the galactic bulge .",
    "such a soft component would be completely absorbed in these cases .",
    "however , the lmxb her x-1 is relatively nearby , and in a direction of low galactic column density ( @xmath64 @xmath9 ) .",
    "observations of her x-1 with _ rosat _ ( mavromatakis 1993 ) and _ asca _ ( vrtilek et al .  1994 ; choi et al .",
    "1996 ) find that a soft component described by a blackbody model with @xmath65 kev or a bremsstrahlung model with @xmath66 kev is needed in addition to a power law model ( for the harder x - ray emission ) in order to fit the spectrum .",
    "the x - ray colors derived from the archived _ rosat _ data were found to be ( c21 , c32@xmath67 for her x-1 .",
    "thus , the soft component seen in x - ray faint galaxies and the bulges of m31 and ngc  1291 also appears to be present in the spectrum of at least one lmxb in our galaxy , as indicated by its low c21 value .",
    "although the c32 value of her x-1 is somewhat higher than that of the group 1 galaxies or the bulge of m31 , it falls within the range of observed c32 values found for individual lmxbs in the bulge of m31 .    if ngc  5102 is excluded , the best - fit relation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 is nearly linear ( figure  [ fig : hard_soft ] ) . along with the fact that the x - ray colors of most of the group 1 galaxies are consistent with emission from stellar emission",
    "as shown above , this suggests that most group 1 galaxies share the same single x - ray emission mechanism , with some galaxies having more x - ray emission per unit blue luminosity than others . at first",
    "this may seem at odds with the results of matsumoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who analyzed _ asca _ spectra from a sample of elliptical and s0 galaxies , and found that all of their galaxies but one had a very hard x - ray spectral component .",
    "this hard component was consistent with a temperature of about 5 kev , and was attributed to the emission from lmxbs .",
    "the luminosity of this hard component scaled linearly with the blue luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "we took the ratio of the @xmath70 kev x - ray luminosity per unit optical luminosity from their paper , and converted the x - ray luminosity to our hard band ( @xmath34 kev ) , assuming model 3 of the fit for the bulge of m31 ( see table  [ tab : m31 ] ) .",
    "this model gave nearly the same conversion factor as a 5 kev thermal bremsstrahlung model , since the soft component of model 3 contributes very little emission in the @xmath71 kev range .",
    "if one excludes galaxies in their sample which may harbor active nuclei , this leads to a _ rosat _",
    "hard band x - ray  to  optical ratio of @xmath72 .",
    "this might be a slight underestimate because of the fact that some of the @xmath70 kev flux from the soft component of matsumoto et al.s ( 1997 ) spectral fits is also from lmxb emission and has not been included in the calculation .",
    "this value is consistent with the luminosity ratios for the more luminous of the group 1 galaxies and for the bulges of m31 and ngc  1291 .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : hard_soft ] shows that there are five galaxies which have upper limits on @xmath69 which are at least a factor of 3 less than the value derived from the matsumoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) correlation .",
    "for example , ngc  5102 has an order of magnitude less hard x - ray emission than expected for its blue luminosity , if the hard component scales linearly with optical luminosity .",
    "the same is true for the nearby dwarf elliptical ngc  205 , which was not included in our sample because it did not meet the requirements stated in ",
    "[ sec : galsamp ] , but nonetheless had an upper limit on log(@xmath69 ) of 28.27 , a factor of 10 less than expected .",
    "one possible explanation for the discrepancy may be that the galaxies in our sample with upper limits on the @xmath69 ratios significantly less than 29.4 have fewer lmxbs per unit blue luminosity than the rest of the galaxies in the sample .",
    "since lmxbs contain accreting neutron stars , the number of lmxbs in a given galaxy would decrease if fewer massive stars have been formed in the galaxy .",
    "this would imply that fainter elliptical galaxies had a steeper initial mass function .",
    "in fact , this theory has been proposed to explain the trend of increasing mg / fe ratios in elliptical galaxies as a function of increasing mass ( worthey , faber , & gonzalez 1992 ) .",
    "if mg is produced primarily by type ii supernovae and fe by type ia supernovae , higher mg / fe ratios for larger ellipticals could imply a higher rate of type ii supernovae and of neutron star production .",
    "models by matteucci ( 1994 ) show that flattening the initial mass function for more more massive galaxies also predicts the @xmath73 relation which is seen in ellipticals .",
    "the five galaxies in the sample ( plus ngc  205 ) with unusually low @xmath69 values all have optical luminosities below @xmath74 and are considerably fainter ( and presumably less massive ) than the rest of the galaxies in the sample ( see figure  [ fig : lxhlb ] ) . on the other hand , the matsumoto sample consisted mostly of luminous ellipticals . according to the above argument , these galaxies should have fewer high mass stars per unit blue luminosity available to make the neutron stars present in lmxbs . matteucci ( 1994 ) argued that the slope of the initial mass function flattened from @xmath75 ( the salpeter imf ) in fainter ellipticals to @xmath76 in brighter ellipticals .",
    "this change will produce about 2.5 times fewer stars in the mass range @xmath77 per optical luminosity in fainter ellipticals as compared to brighter ones .",
    "we assume that only stars which are initially more massive than @xmath78 evolve into neutron stars or black holes .",
    "this difference might be large enough to account for the lower proportion of lmxbs in most of the fainter group 1 galaxies , but not in ngc  5102 or ngc  205 .",
    "it should be noted , though , that the optical luminosity of the bulge of m31 is rather low ( @xmath3@xmath79 ) , yet it has only a slightly lower than expected log(@xmath69 ) value ( 29.21 ) .",
    "it is also possible that fluctuations in the small number of active lmxbs in faint early - type galaxies contribute to the variation in the x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratio .",
    "in particular , both ngc  5102 and ngc  205 have very low optical luminosities ( @xmath80 for ngc  5102 , and @xmath81 for ngc  205 ) . if the average x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratio of faint ellipticals is @xmath82 , then we would expect an x - ray luminosity of @xmath83 ergs s@xmath12 for ngc  5102 and @xmath84 ergs s@xmath12 for ngc  205 . particularly in the latter case",
    ", this would correspond to a small number of lmxbs .",
    "next we address the issue of why group 1 galaxies do not appear to have a significant interstellar medium component like their x - ray bright counterparts .",
    "detailed hydrodynamical simulations of the evolutionary behavior of the gas flow in elliptical galaxies by loewenstein & mathews ( 1987 ) show that bright , massive galaxies develop hot , gaseous halos after the type ii supernovae rate declines early in the galaxy s history .",
    "on the other hand , less massive galaxies are able to sustain a wind due to type ia supernovae .",
    "this wind drives the gas lost from stars out of the galaxy .",
    "the efficiency of wind mass loss depended on the assumed type ia supernovae rate and the presence and distribution of a dark matter halo .",
    "later work by david , forman , & jones ( 1991 ) extended the simulations to include galaxies with luminosities as low as @xmath85 , and found basically the same results .",
    "the hydrodynamical models of ciotti et al .",
    "( 1991 ) suggested that hot gas in elliptical galaxies undergo a three stage ( wind , outflow , inflow ) evolution .",
    "all three studies concluded that galaxies covering the range of observed @xmath1 values can be described in terms of differing hydrodynamical states of the gas ranging from supersonic winds to partial winds to cooling flows , depending on the galaxy s mass distribution and supernovae rate .",
    "since the group 1 galaxies have the lowest optical luminosities and velocity dispersions in the sample , they should have shallower potential wells and could still be in the wind stage of their evolution .",
    "if this argument is correct , then there should exist galaxies which have some , but not all of their ism removed .",
    "these galaxies would have comparable amounts of x - ray emission from the stellar and gaseous components .",
    "if so , these galaxies might have colors which differ somewhat from those of the purely stellar sources , such as the bulges of m31 and ngc  1291 . to search for this",
    "we have subdivided the 15 group 1 galaxies for which colors were determined into three groups based on @xmath69 . the x - ray colors of these galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig : group1 ] .",
    "6.30truein 0.3truein    the two lowest @xmath69 subgroups among group 1 galaxies ( filled triangles and filled squares ) have colors which scatter around those of the spiral bulges ( hexagons ) , at least within the errors .",
    "on the other hand , the highest @xmath69 subgroup ( open squares ) have colors which are distinctly different than those of the bulges .",
    "this could be explained by the presence of an additional soft component with c@xmath86 and c@xmath87 .",
    "this extra soft component would naturally explain why these galaxies have higher @xmath1 values than the x - ray faintest galaxies .",
    "below , we show that an ism provides the most reasonable explanation for the additional soft component .",
    "previous authors ( kim et al .  1992 ; pellegrini & fabbiano 1994 ) have suggested that the integrated emission from m star coronae , rs cvn binary stars , supersoft sources , or a warm ism is responsible for the soft component found in group 1 galaxies , since these sources have the soft x - ray properties needed to explain the soft emission .",
    "however , the general consensus was that none of these mechanisms is entirely responsible for the soft x - ray emission .",
    "earlier , we showed that lmxbs are probably responsible for the soft emission in the x - ray faintest galaxies and not the sources mentioned above . here , we present further arguments as to why these sources can not be substantial contributors to the x - ray emission in the x - ray faintest galaxies , although a warm ism may be present in the brighter group 1 galaxies .",
    "although intrinsically faint x - ray sources , m dwarf stars can be a source of substantial x - ray emission because of the sheer number of m stars relative to dwarf stars of earlier spectral types .",
    "m stars are also known to possess soft x - ray characteristics ( giampapa et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , it is unlikely that m dwarf stars are bright enough to produce the required x - ray luminosity . as pointed out by pellegrini & fabbiano ( 1994 ) ,",
    "if one assumes a salpeter initial mass function and an appropriate mass - to - light ratio for elliptical galaxies , the average x - ray luminosity per m star must be @xmath88 ergs s@xmath12 to account for the very soft x - ray emission in the x - ray faint galaxy ngc  4365 .",
    "schmitt , fleming , & giampapa ( 1995 ) show that the average x - ray luminosity of stars in the solar neighborhood is @xmath3@xmath89 ergs s@xmath12 .",
    "this is likely to be a significant overestimate of the average x - ray luminosity of m stars in old stellar systems , as the x - ray luminosity of stars is expected to decrease with age as the rotation of the star ( and hence magnetic activity which produces the x - ray emission ) decreases ( skumanich 1972 ) .",
    "another test of the average x - ray luminosity of older m dwarf stars is provided by globular clusters .",
    "given that globular clusters and elliptical galaxies possess similar stellar populations , x - ray emission from any stellar source should scale with optical luminosity between the two systems . to search for a diffuse x - ray component in globulars",
    ", we extracted the _ rosat _ pspc observation of ngc  6752 from the archive .",
    "we selected this globular cluster because of its low galactic column density ( @xmath90 @xmath9 ; stark et al .",
    "1992 ) , its proximity ( distance of 4.2 kpc ) , and its bright apparent blue magnitude , @xmath91 , which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath92 ( peterson 1993 ) . after cleaning ,",
    "the exposure was 4939 s. the x - ray luminosity in the soft band was determined within the half - light radius of @xmath93 ( trager , djorgovski , & king 1993 ) , using the same spectral model as was used for the galaxy sample .",
    "a @xmath36 upper limit of @xmath94 ergs s@xmath12 was obtained for the @xmath13 kev luminosity within the half - light radius , corresponding to an upper limit on @xmath68 of 27.23 .",
    "this is a factor of nearly 300 less than the @xmath68 value of the x - ray faint galaxies ngc  4365 and ngc  4382 .",
    "these limits on the diffuse x - ray emission from globular clusters also apply to any other stellar source for the soft x - ray emission in group 1 ellipticals .",
    "there are , however , at least two ways in which this limit might be circumvented . first , the central regions of elliptical galaxies have very high stellar metallicities , much higher than even the most metal rich globular clusters ( aaronson et al .  1978 ) .",
    "thus , if there were a stellar component whose x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratio increased extremely rapidly with the metallicity of the stars , then the globular cluster limits would not apply . since elliptical galaxies have metallicities which decrease with galactocentric radius ( schombert et al .",
    "1993 ) , this model would predict that the x - ray emission in the faintest elliptical galaxies is more centrally condensed than the optical emission . for the x - ray faint galaxy ngc  4382",
    ", the emission in both x - ray bands seems to be somewhat more extended than the optical light .",
    "this model would also require that the x - ray colors of group 1 galaxies become harder with increasing radius .",
    "for the few group 1 galaxies with enough counts to derive radial color profiles , this does not seem to be the case ( see   [ sec : radcolor ] ) .",
    "another possible exception to the limits from globular clusters is that they do not apply to any stellar component which is the result of rare but very luminous x - ray sources",
    ". such sources might be too uncommon to have been found in the globular clusters searched .",
    "given the typical blue optical luminosities of the group 1 galaxies of @xmath95 and the blue luminosities of the globular clusters of @xmath96 , such rare sources would have to be more luminous in x - rays than @xmath97 ergs s@xmath12 .",
    "if the x - ray luminosity were less , the number of such objects required in galaxies would imply that one such object would have been observed in most globular clusters observed to date .",
    "in fact , one possible candidate ( a supersoft source in m3 ) has been found among all of the globulars observed ( verbunt et al .",
    "[ sec : origin_group1_sss ] ) .",
    "rs cvn systems are composed of a g or k giant or subgiant and a late - type main sequence or subgiant companion .",
    "a similar type of binary system are by draconis stars , composed of two late - type main sequence stars . in principle , these systems have some advantages as x - ray sources in elliptical galaxies when compared to single stars .",
    "the rapid rotation brought on by the synchronization of the rotation period to the orbital period leads to substantially higher magnetic activity ( and hence x - ray emission ) in these systems than in single old main sequence stars .",
    "dempsey et al .",
    "( 1993 ) find that rs cvns have x - ray luminosities which range from @xmath98 ergs s@xmath12 and spectra which are described by a two - temperature raymond smith model : a low temperature ( 0.2 kev ) component and a high temperature ( 1.5 kev ) component , with the high temperature component having a volume emission measure about 2.5 times that of the low temperature component .",
    "although the presence of a @xmath30.2 kev component appears promising in explaining the soft component in ellipticals and s0s , the two temperature model predicts colors of ( 0.26 , 1.51 ) .",
    "the c32 color is significantly harder than that observed for group 1 galaxies . also , the c21 colors of rs cvns are also somewhat harder than those observed for the faintest group 1 galaxies , and the addition of a third component needed to lower the c32 value will raise c21 even more .",
    "thus , it appears unlikely that rs cvn systems can contribute appreciably to the x - ray emission of x - ray faint early - type galaxies . by draconis binary systems",
    "have nearly identical spectral properties to rs cvn stars ( dempsey et al .",
    "1997 ) , and are also unlikely candidates for the source of the soft x - ray emission in group 1 galaxies .      a relatively new class of x - ray emitting objects first observed with _ einstein _ and later confirmed with",
    "_ rosat _ are supersoft sources .",
    "supersoft sources have been detected in our galaxy ( gelman et al .",
    "1993 ) , m31 ( supper et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the magellanic clouds ( kahabka , pietsch , & hasinger 1994 ) .",
    "little is known about the distribution and relative number of these sources among hubble types , so it it possible that early - type galaxies can contain a significantly larger number of them than spiral galaxies .",
    "supersoft sources are characterized by a lack of emission above @xmath30.4 kev , and are believed to be the result of a white dwarf burning matter accreted from a companion star ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "supersoft source spectra can be fit by a blackbody model with a temperature of @xmath99 ev .",
    "they typically have luminosities in the _ rosat _ band of a few @xmath100 erg s@xmath12 ( kahabka et al .",
    "thus , @xmath3@xmath101 such sources would be necessary to account for the soft x - ray emission in the most x - ray luminous group 1 galaxies .",
    "these sources are bright enough and rare enough that we would not expect them to occur commonly in globular clusters ; thus , they would not be subject to the limits on the diffuse soft emission from globulars in   [ sec : origin_group1_mstar ] . for a typical globular cluster with an optical luminosity of @xmath102 ,",
    "an x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratio of @xmath103 implies an x - ray luminosity of @xmath104 ergs s@xmath12 , or 1/20 of an @xmath105 ergs s@xmath12 supersoft source .",
    "in fact , only one supersoft source has been observed within a globular cluster ; the globular cluster m3 was observed to harbor such a supersoft source ( verbunt et al .",
    "1994 ) , albeit a rather faint one ( @xmath106 ergs s@xmath12 ) .    however , the colors predicted by such a component are far too low to match the observed values . a blackbody model with a temperature of 50 ev yields ( c21 , c32@xmath107 .",
    "thus , the addition of supersoft sources will diminish the c21 value obtained for bulges , which is in the opposite sense of what is observed for the brighter group 1 galaxies .      as mentioned above ,",
    "if the x - ray faintest galaxies have lost their interstellar medium due to winds , there should exist some galaxies which have had some but not all of their ism removed .",
    "the five group 1 galaxies with the highest @xmath69 values may represent this class .",
    "perhaps a few of the faintest group 2 galaxies are members of this class also .",
    "the colors of the five group 1 galaxies suspected to have some ism are ( c21 , c32@xmath108 and the colors of the stellar component as derived from m31 are ( c21 , c32@xmath109 . depending on the relative contributions from the stellar and gaseous components , the colors of the gaseous component required to yield the observed colors would be in the range ( c21 , c32@xmath110 .",
    "judging from the color models of figure  [ fig : c21c32em ] , a thermal model with a temperature of @xmath111 kev and a metallicity of @xmath112 of solar would be capable of producing the required colors when combined with the emission from stellar sources .",
    "this is the range of temperatures of metallicities that would be expected from interstellar gas in low luminosity systems , if one extrapolates from the brighter galaxies .    among the three galaxies for which color profiles could be derived ,",
    "there is no consensus concerning the radial color trends .",
    "ngc  4382 shows a constant c21 and c32 profile .",
    "ngc  4697 shows a constant c21 profile and a decreasing c32 profile .",
    "ngc  4365 shows a decreasing c21 profile and a constant c32 profile .",
    "this lack of agreement could mean that the ism component is more extended than the stellar component in some galaxies and less extended in others .",
    "alternatively , gradients in the temperature and abundance of the ism component might also be responsible for the color gradients .",
    "we have analyzed a large elliptical and s0 galaxy sample observed with the _ rosat _ pspc .",
    "we derived x - ray luminosities and x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratios in soft and hard _ rosat _ bands .",
    "we defined two x - ray colors ; integrated values and radial profiles in these two colors were determined for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we find a very large range in values ( a factor of @xmath3500 ) for the x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratio for galaxies in our sample , as has generally been found in the past .",
    "the x - ray colors , the color profiles , and the ratio of hard to soft band luminosities all vary as a function of @xmath113 , which suggests that different emission processes are important in different galaxies .",
    "we divide the galaxies into four groups based on their x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratio : group 1 , @xmath43 ; group 2 , @xmath42 ; group 3 , @xmath41 ; group 4 , @xmath40 .",
    "the x - ray brightest galaxies ( group 4 ) have colors and luminosities which are consistent with thermal emission from hot gas at temperatures around 0.8 kev and abundances of approximately one - half solar .",
    "these galaxies have hard and soft band x - ray luminosities which increase in proportion to one another , and which increase rapidly with the optical luminosity .",
    "they often sit at the centers of groups , and there is evidence that this increases their x - ray luminosities .",
    "the galaxies in deeper potential wells may have higher x - ray luminosities per unit blue luminosity because they have lost less gas during their early evolution , or have accreted group gas .",
    "the intermediate x - ray luminosity galaxies ( groups 2 and 3 ) have colors which are generally consistent with thermal emission from lower temperature and abundance gas than the group 4 galaxies .",
    "for these galaxies , the soft band x - ray luminosity  to  optical luminosity ratios ( @xmath68 ) are nearly constant from galaxy to galaxy , while the hard band luminosity drops more rapidly than the optical luminosity .",
    "one explanation for this trend would be if the hard band luminosity were dominated by thermal emission by gas , and the soft band luminosity were dominated by stellar sources .",
    "this would require that the thermal x - ray luminosity decline rapidly with decreasing optical luminosity , as is seen for the brighter group 1 galaxies .",
    "however , this would not explain why the soft band x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratio @xmath68 continues to decrease for @xmath114 .",
    "also , the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ x - ray spectra of these galaxies suggest that the bulk of the emission is thermal emission from hot gas with subsolar abundances ( e.g. , davis & white 1996 ; matsumoto et al .  1997 ) .",
    "alternatively , the bulk of the x - ray luminosity might be thermal in origin , with @xmath69 decreasing as the gaseous iron abundance decreases .",
    "we show that lowering the iron abundance mainly reduces the _ rosat _ hard band emission , because this emission is dominated by the iron @xmath115-line complex at @xmath31 kev .",
    "the x - ray emission from most of the fainter group 1 galaxies can best be described as the integrated emission from low mass x - ray binaries as was seen to be the case for the bulge of m31 . in these galaxies ,",
    "the ism could have been removed by supernovae - driven winds .",
    "the x - ray colors and x - ray  to  optical luminosity ratios for all but a small subset of the group 1 galaxies were consistent with the colors of the bulges of m31 and ngc  1291 . the soft component previously seen in these galaxies was shown to be the result of the more complex spectrum of lmxbs ; they are not well - represented by a simple , single temperature 5 kev bremsstrahlung model , which had been previously assumed for lmxbs .",
    "the x - ray colors of the nearby lmxb her x-1 confirm the existence of a soft x - ray component in at least one galactic lmxb .",
    "individual lmxbs in the faintest galaxies should be resolvable with _ axaf _ for galaxies as far away as virgo .    as supporting evidence that the soft component is from lmxbs",
    ", we show that the three most likely alternative stellar sources of the soft emission are unlikely to be important contributors .",
    "we find that m stars can match the x - ray colors of group 1 ellipticals , but that they are probably too faint .",
    "we set a limit on the cumulative x - ray luminosity of old m stars from upper limits on the diffuse x - ray emission from globular clusters .",
    "this gives x - ray luminosities which are a factor of at least 300 lower than the soft band x - ray luminosities of group 1 ellipticals .",
    "( however , this limit might not apply if the x - ray emission from m stars increased strongly with metallicity . )",
    "rs cvn stars have c32 colors which are too hard to match the observed colors of ellipticals , and adding hard emission from lmxbs only increases the discrepancy .",
    "supersoft sources are too soft to explain the observed colors of ellipticals .",
    "the brightest of the group 1 galaxies might contain significant amounts of interstellar matter which has not been completely removed from the galaxy .",
    "these galaxies have higher c21 values and lower c32 values than the other group 1 galaxies",
    ". this would account for their higher @xmath1 values as compared to the faintest group 1 galaxies and the bulges .",
    "if the ism has a temperature of @xmath111 kev and low metallicities , its emission would produce the observed colors when mixed with the right proportion of stellar emission .",
    "finally , we find that the faintest x - ray galaxies have hard band _ rosat _ x - ray luminosities which are significantly less than expected from the integrated emission of lmxbs , as derived from brighter elliptical galaxies ( matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ) and spiral galaxy bulges .",
    "this suggests that the fractional population or luminosity of lmxbs may be lower in less luminous galaxies .",
    "one way to produce such a variation would be if the slope of the initial mass function in early - type galaxies became flatter as the optical luminosity increased .",
    "small number statistical variations in the number of lmxbs in these galaxies may also play a role .",
