    "experimental breakthrough in isolation of high - quality few - layer graphene by exfoliation and epitaxial growth has led to intense experimental and theoretical interest in graphene materials @xcite .",
    "recently , much interest has been focused on the ab - bernal stacked bilayer graphene ( blg ) for fundamental physics and application potential in nanotechnology @xcite . with its own special nature",
    ", blg inherits some characteristics of the monolayer graphene ( mlg ) carrying chiral dirac fermions .",
    "intrinsic blg is identified as a zero - gap semiconductor with quadratic band dispersion in low - energy regime instead of the linear band dispersion in mlg . in such a case ,",
    "the density of state ( dos ) in blg at the two nonequivalent dirac points , called the @xmath0 and @xmath1 points , is a constant , in contract to vanishing dos in mlg . hence , blg shares some similar features with two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "specifically , an energy gap between the conduction and valence bands can be easily opened and tuned by introducing an electrostatic potential bias between the two graphene layers @xcite .",
    "the bias modifies the parabolic band structure , and increases the dos at the top of the valance band and the bottom of conduction band .",
    "previous studies have clearly evidenced that coulomb interactions play a significant role in graphene @xcite .",
    "similarly , electron - electron interactions in blg can also lead to exotic phenomena .",
    "the many - body effects are crucial to understanding the transport and optical properties of the system .",
    "a particularly fruitful phenomenon is the dynamic screening .",
    "the frequency dependent screening determines the elementary quasiparticle spectra as well as the collective modes . at zero temperature ,",
    "the screening properties and the plasmon spectrum in blg have been studied analytically in the two- and four - band approximations @xcite . for systems at finite temperature and under electric bias ,",
    "numerical calculations have been employed to study the properties in the two - band approximation @xcite . because of the distinguished energy band dispersions and chiralities , coulomb screening properties and collective excitations in blg exhibit significantly different behavior from the mlg and conventional 2degs .",
    "experimentally the plasmon spectra and damping properties in graphene structures have been studied by methods such as electron - energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) @xcite .",
    "surface plasmon modes have been used for the rapidly developing terahertz ( thz ) technology @xcite and stimulated emission of plasmon in graphene has been proposed to be used as thz laser at room temperature @xcite .",
    "one efficient way to increase the net plasmon gain is to decrease the group velocity of plasmon in the system .",
    "the plasmon dispersion in blg is similar to that in mlg and might be easier to manipulate with the help of applied electric bias between the two layers . in this paper ,",
    "based on ref .",
    "[ ] , we numerically study the dynamic screening properties of the coulomb interaction in blg systems within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and consider a fair general situation in which both the temperature and the bias voltage are finite .",
    "we calculate the dielectric function of blg @xmath2 at arbitrary wavevectors @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the zeros of the real part @xmath5 give the dispersion of the plasmon modes ; the imaginary part @xmath6 indicates their damping properties to single particle excitations ; the imaginary part of @xmath7 is related to their optical spectral weight . beyond from ref .",
    "[ ] , here we have explored systematically and in a high accuracy the screening properties and the plasmon spectra in a wide parameter space , and in some parameter regimes have found two extra plasmon modes with almost zero group velocities .",
    "since there are four inequivalent carbon atoms , the blg system should be described by the four - band model which gives a hyperbolic dispersion @xcite . in the four - band model , a split - off band",
    "is located at @xmath8 ev above the lowest conduction band and a sombrero shape of band is formed at the bottom of the conduction band in the existence of electric bias . if the fermi energy ( @xmath9 mev under @xmath10 mev for @xmath11 @xmath12 ) plus the thermal energy ( @xmath13 mev at @xmath14 k ) is much lower than @xmath15 , the effect from the split - off band should be negligible . for a bias potential @xmath10 mev ,",
    "the height of the sombrero is @xmath16 mev @xcite . in systems with carrier density @xmath17 higher than the critical density @xmath18 ( @xmath19 @xmath12 for @xmath20 = 60 mev ) ,",
    "the fermi energy is above the sombrero and the topology of the fermi surface is not affected by the sombrero . in this case , the effect of the sombrero appears as a dos broadening ( with a width of the height of the sombrero ) at the bottom of the conduction band . since",
    "one part of the thermal effect is also similar to a dos broadening with a width of the thermal energy , the effect of the sombrero can also be neglected if the thermal energy is much higher than the sombrero height .",
    "therefore , the low - energy properties of the system can be qualitatively well characterized by the two - band parabolic approximation which is valid in the range of density @xmath17 ( 0.5 to 2 @xmath21 @xmath12 ) , temperature @xmath22 ( 4.2 to 300 k ) , and bias potential @xmath20 ( up to 60 mev ) most interested in this study .",
    "within such a picture , a pair of chiral parabolic electron and hole bands touch each other at the dirac ( or the charge neutrality ) point , and each band has a four - fold degeneracy arising from spin and valley degrees of freedom .",
    "note that the quadratic band dispersion in the two - band approximation deviates from the hyperbolic band dispersion predicted by the four - band model even in the intermediate energy regime .",
    "the corresponding results in some situations might differ quantitatively from those in real systems .",
    "for the sake of completeness , some zero - temperature results of systems with low carrier density , where the sombrero effect might not be negligible , are presented in the following .",
    "the low - energy effective hamiltonian describing electrons of moderate energies in the @xmath0 valley of biased blg reads as @xcite @xmath23 in the first term , the wavevector @xmath24 with @xmath25 is measured from the @xmath0 point ; the effective mass is @xmath26 with @xmath27 the interlayer tunneling amplitude inherent in the blg system , @xmath28 the graphene fermi velocity , and @xmath29 the free electron mass .",
    "the second term arises from the electrostatic potential bias @xmath20 between the two graphene layers separated by a distance @xmath30 .",
    "the eigenenergy and eigenwavefunction of the above hamiltonian read @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes respectively the conduction and the valence band . here",
    "@xmath33 is the azimuth of the vector @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 = @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 indicates the ratio of the kinetic energy to the potential bias with @xmath39 = @xmath40 .",
    "for such an energy dispersion the dos of the system is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant degeneracy factor . here",
    "@xmath43 comes from the degenerate two spins and two valleys at @xmath0 and @xmath1 . under finite bias @xmath20 ,",
    "the dos of the blg diverges on the edge of the energy gap @xmath44 .",
    "it has been shown that the static dielectric constant at @xmath45 in intrinsic blg is much larger than that in mlg due to the presence of a finite dos at the @xmath0 point @xcite .",
    "the bias might further modify the system s properties in a large range of variety .",
    "the wavevector and frequency - dependent dielectric function @xmath46 tells the response of the system to a weak external perturbation , and determines a variety of many - body related terms such as self - energy , carrier lifetime , and mobility , as well as characterization of other excitations . in the rpa , it is given as @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( with the background dielectric constant @xmath49 ) is the fourier transformation of the bare coulomb interaction and the electron - hole propagator is originated from the bare bubble diagram @xcite @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the fermi function and the vertex factor reads @xmath52.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath45 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 = @xmath55 .",

    "the interband one , which can be manipulated by the bias voltage , modifies qualitatively the screening properties of the system . since the approximate energy spectrum we use in this study is isotropic , the obtained properties are also isotropic and we use @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the following discussion .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : intra - u ] , we plot the negative intraband propagator in unit of @xmath71 ( the dos of intrinsic blg ) versus frequency @xmath4 for three typical wavevector @xmath72 values .",

    "the derivative of the imaginary part is not continuous at the continuum edges and for @xmath74 is also not continuous at @xmath79 besides @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "when the bias @xmath20 increases , the structures of the curves shift to lower energy because the energy band is narrowed and the group velocity of electrons at the bottom of the conduction band decreases . when the temperature increases , the sharp edges become smoother and the nonzero range gets wider as expected .    different from the 2deg result , as illustrated in fig.[fig : intra - u](c ) for @xmath82 at @xmath64 and @xmath66 , the imaginary part has a sharp dip with a derivative discontinuity at @xmath83 between the edges due to the chiral nature of the wave functions @xcite .",

    "the peak near @xmath94 may become very sharp for small @xmath72 in biased blg because the bottom ( top ) of the conduction ( valence ) band becomes flat and the dos diverges on the edge of energy gap . the overall contribution of interband excitation to the propagator increases with @xmath72 and in a way @xmath95 at small @xmath72 .",
