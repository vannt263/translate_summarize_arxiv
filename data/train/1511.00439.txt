    "the comprehensive analysis of various observational data ( cosmic microwave background , supernova type ia , large - scale structures , etc . ) supports a picture in which the universe is spatially flat with only about @xmath4 of its total energy in the form of dark or luminous forms of matter .",
    "the nature of the remaining @xmath5 , residing in some unknown form of enigmatic dark energy remains a mystery even though it can be accurately described by a particular type of anti - gravitating stress .",
    "discovering the physics of this dark energy , driving the recent accelerated expansion of the universe , is a key goal of theoretical physics and cosmology .",
    "the intense debate among the cosmologists and theoretical physics has opened up the possibility of various new cosmological scenarios which offer different sources for the observed acceleration and even a possibility to link it to the suspected era of inflationary acceleration in the very early universe .",
    "some of these scenarios are based on the existence of new fields in nature , while others modify the classical einstein - hilbert action for gravity @xcite .    in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw )",
    "cosmologies containing scalar fields , some analytical solutions without matter can be found in @xcite .",
    "if a matter component is included in the dynamics then new solutions were also found in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a new class of solutions has been found from the application of group invariants , namely lie / noether symmetries of the field equations @xcite .",
    "in fact the idea to use noether point symmetries in cosmology is not new and indeed there is a lot of work in the literature ( see @xcite ) . in some previous papers",
    "we have provided the lie / noether symmetries for various cosmological models , including scalar fields @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite and scalar tensor theories @xcite .",
    "recently , we have used this dynamical symmetry approach in order to provide solutions to the wdw equation @xcite .    in general for scalar - tensor theories , including the particular case of brans - dicke gravity @xcite , various analytical solutions are available in the literature @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "an exact solution describes a brans - dicke scalar field which interacts with a perfect fluid in the action integral .",
    "moreover , some closed - form solutions for plane symmetric spacetimes can be found in @xcite , and some black - hole solutions in brans - dicke gravity are given in @xcite . using the method of group invariants , some new exact solutions without matter source",

    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the method proposed in ref.@xcite to brans - dicke gravity when the perfect fluid does not interact with the brans - dicke field in the action integral .",
    "the proposed selection rule determines the potential that defines the brans - dicke field in order for the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation to be invariant under a group of point transformations . in @xcite that proposed method",
    "was applied in general relativistic cosmology for a homogeneous scalar field and a perfect fluid .",
    "it has been shown that when the wdw equation is invariant under one - parameter point transformation then , the wdw equation can be solved by separation of variables .",
    "the solution provides oscillatory terms in the wavefunction and , at the same time , the point transformations give noetherian conservation laws for the classical field equations .",
    "this latter property can be used to study the integrability of the field equations and extract closed - form solutions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ field ]",
    "we present the field equations in brans - dicke gravity . in section [ sym ]",
    "we apply lie point symmetries to the wdw equation and , in section [ solutions ] , we provide the invariant solution of the wdw equation .",
    "also , in the same section , we use the hamilton - jacobi theory to reduce the field equations to a pair of first - order differential equations and under specific conditions ( the noetherian conservation law vanishes ) we obtain a closed - form solution for the hubble parameter in brans - dicke gravity . then we check the performance of this special brans - dicke model against the latest observational data .",

    "furthermore , with the use of the hamilton - jacobi theory we reduced the hamiltonian system , which defines the classical field equations , to a system of two first - order differential equations .",
    "that is , the field equations for that form of the potential , @xmath90 , form a liouville integrable dynamical system .      as a special case for one of the integrable models",
    ", we found a closed - form solution for the hubble function from which we saw that the brans - dicke field follows power - law behaviour with respect to the metric scale factor , that is , @xmath282 . in this context , the hubble parameter is written as @xmath283 , where the parameters @xmath284 are given in terms of @xmath285 .",
    "obviously , one may recover a similar hubble parameter to this within the framework of general relativistic cosmology by using two different perfect fluids with constant equation of state parameters .",
    "this implies that the current brans - dicke gravity model is cosmologically equivalent to that of general relativity as far as the cosmic expansion is concerned .",
    "therefore , in order to distinguish brans - dicke gravity from gr we need to extend the analysis to the perturbation level .",
    "it is well known that modified gravity affects , via the effective gravitational constant the growth rate of linear matter perturbations . as an example , in the case of @xmath6 gravity models the quantity @xmath286 is given in terms of the scale factor and of the wave - number ( see @xcite,@xcite and references therein ) . in a forthcoming paper , we attempt to investigate the impact of the brans - dicke gravitational parameter @xmath287",
    "^{-1}$ ] on the matter perturbations .",
    "lastly , performing a joint statistical analysis involving the recent snia and bao data , we place constraints on the main cosmological parameters of the brans - dicke model .    it has also been shown that there exists a relation between the value of the conserved quantity ,  @xmath288 , for the classical field equations and the frequency ,  @xmath153 , in the wdw equation .",
    "hartle proposed that strong peaks in the wavefunction lead to a classical observable universe @xcite .",
    "since the wdw equation is a linear second - order pde , the general invariant solution is the sum on all possible values of @xmath153 .",
    "however , one may relate the frequency  of the strong peaks of the wavefunction to the value of the conserved quantity , @xmath288 , ( [ bd.38 ] ) .",
    "the latter is included in the solution of the field equations , i.e. @xmath289 , and consequently in the hubble function @xmath290 . in any case",
    ", the existence of the conservation law indicates a strong relation between the classical and the quantum solutions and information can be transferred from among the two systems . however , the physical observable quantities which correspond to the conservation laws of the field equations are still unknown .",
    "the brans - dicke action is defined in the jordan frame and is conformally equivalent to the minimally coupled scalar field in the einstein frame .",
    "the solutions which we have found describe a perfect fluid which is not interacting with the scalar field in the jordan frame .",
    "however , the solutions can be transformed into the einstein frame and will hold for a model in which there exists an interaction between the perfect fluid and the scalar field of a particular form . by definition ,",
    "the two models share the same solution of the wdw equation .",
