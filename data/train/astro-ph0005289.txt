    "gx  51 is the second brightest persistent galactic x - ray source .",
    "the source is well studied in x - rays ; it was classified as a z source on the basis of the pattern it traces in a colour - colour diagram and its timing properties ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations with frequencies of 1350 hz , 6 hz , and 200800 hz were detected in the x - ray lightcurves ( van der klis 1985a , b ; lewin et al .",
    "1992 ; wijnands et al .",
    "1999 , respectively ) .",
    "naylor , charles , & longmore ( 1991 ) identified several candidate infrared counterparts of gx  51 .",
    "since it is located near the galactic centre , source confusion and heavy optical obscuration hinder the classification .",
    "gx  51 is also a radio source ( braes , miley , & schoenmaker 1972 ; grindley & seaquist 1986 ; penninx et al .",
    "1988 ; berendsen et al .",
    "2000 ) , like all z sources ( hjellming & han 1995 ; fender & hendry 2000 ) .",
    "the radio emission is likely to arise in a compact jet from the system .",
    "the radio counterpart allows for extremely accurate position measurements .",
    "study of the z sources has been hampered in most cases by the lack of reliable optical and/or infrared counterparts .",
    "for example , deutsch et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the proposed infrared counterpart ( tarenghi & reina 1972 ) of another persistently x - ray bright z source , gx  17 + 2 was not consistent with the position of its radio counterpart .",
    "furthermore , they detected a faint star close to the proposed counterpart .",
    "callanan , fillipenko , & garcia ( 1999 ) reported variability of about 3.5 - 4 mag in the k band for the latter , providing additional evidence for its classification as the counterpart .    in this letter",
    ", we present united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) infrared ( ir ) observations of the x - ray source gx  51 .",
    "we resolve the previously reported counterparts , and show that the radio position is consistent with only one of them .",
    "we observed the field of gx  51 with ukirt .",
    "observations were taken in h , k , and in a narrow filter around the brackett gamma line ( br@xmath0 ) in 1999 may and october .",
    "a log of the observations can be found in table  [ log ] .",
    "the observations of 1999 , may 23 were obtained using the ircam3 camera ; the frames consist of 256 @xmath1 256 pixels with a pixel size of 0.286 arc seconds . the observations of 1999 ,",
    "october 8 and 13 were performed using the ufti camera ; the ufti frames consist of 1024 @xmath1 1024 pixels , with a pixel size of 0.0909 arc seconds .",
    "the br@xmath0 narrow filter is centred on the wavelength of the br@xmath0 line ( 2.166 micron ; 50% of the light was obtained in the wavelength range 2.1512.171 @xmath2 m in case of ircam3 observations , and in the range 2.1552.177 @xmath2 m in case of ufti observations ) .",
    "the night was photometric only during the 1999 , may 23 observations .",
    "the exposure time used in the br@xmath0 filter was 100 seconds , and in the h and k filter band a 10 second exposure was used . on 1999 , october 13 an observation time of 100 seconds was used in the k band .",

    "we have shown that star 513 of naylor et al .",
    "( 1991 ) is most likely the ir counterpart of the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) gx  51 , since its position coincides with the accurate position of the radio counterpart .",
    "furthermore , the br@xmath0k instrumental colour is smaller for star 513 , when compared to the reference stars in the field .",
    "this effect , although only marginally detected might be caused by the presence of a br@xmath0 emission line in the spectrum of star 513 .",
    "the presence of an absorption line could result in a higher br@xmath0k colour , which might explain the higher value obtained for star 507 .",
    "the h and k magnitudes we derived are significantly lower than the h and k magnitudes derived by naylor et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , but as they mention in their paper they estimate systematic errors to play a role ( although these errors were estimated to be smaller than the discrepancy with our results ) .",
    "bandyopadhyay et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained ir spectra of the stars 502 and 503 .",
    "since they did not find evidence for emission typical of an accretion disk in these two stars , they suggested that star 513 might be the counterpart of gx  51 .",
    "the counterpart ( star 513 ) did not vary significantly in any of the three filters ( h , k , and br@xmath0 ) we used .",
    "its reddening uncorrected h ",
    "k colour index is 0.4 . using the conversion of @xmath3 ( predehl & schmitt 1995 ) and the estimate of @xmath4 for gx  51 of @xmath5 ( christian & swank 1997 ; see table  [ zsources ] ) we obtain @xmath6 . using the relations found by rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) we obtained an intrinsic @xmath7 .",
    "this is bluer than stellar ( tokunaga 2000 ) , which may indicate an overestimate of the extinction . limiting the intrinsic emission in the near - infrared to be no steeper than the rayleigh - jeans tail of a black - body implies @xmath8 .    in table  [ zsources ] we compare the k - band absolute magnitudes of the six z sources plus the ` hybrid z / atoll ' source gx  13 + 1 , based on the estimated distance and @xmath9 to each source .",
    "there is a rather large range , from as bright as @xmath10 for gx  13 + 1 to possibly as faint as @xmath11 for gx  17 + 2 if the observed k magnitude in quiescence is as faint as @xmath12 ( callanan et al .",
    "uncertainties in distance estimates and reddening are likely to be significant at a level of about @xmath13 magnitude , and so can not account for the broad range .",
    "several different components may contribute significantly to the emission in the near  infrared ; as a guide to their significance ( see below ) we have also listed binary orbital periods and , where available , the spectral types of the mass donors in table  [ zsources ] .",
    "thermal emission will be produced both by the stellar companion and the accretion disc ( for a discussion of their relative contributions see also bandyopadhyay et al .",
    "1997 ; 1999 ) .",
    "we may expect the accretion - disc contribution to depend on the size of the disc ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) , which in turn should be a function of the orbital period of the system .",
    "we note that for the three systems with some attempt at spectral classification of the mass donor there is a good agreement between the absolute k band magnitudes derived and those expected for the companion spectral class .",
    "this implies that gx  51 should contain a relatively bright mass donor .",
    "luminosity class iii was found for the companion star in sco  x1 and cyg  x2 ( see table  [ zsources ] , and references therein ) . following the conjecture made by hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) that all z sources have evolved companions , we assume also luminosity class iii for gx  51 .",
    "the companion star in gx  51 is then most likely of spectral type k.    there may also be an additional contribution from infrared synchrotron emission , as found in the black hole system grs  1915 + 105 ( fender & pooley 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "if at all , this should only occur when the source is radio  bright .",
    "the z sources are brightest at radio wavelengths when they are observed on the horizontal branch ( hb ) in the x - ray colour - colour diagram ( penninx et al . 1988 ; hjellming & han 1995 ) .",
    "radio flaring in z sources typically has amplitudes of a few mjy ( hjellming & han 1995 and references therein ) ; if the synchrotron emission has a flat spectrum to the near - infrared we might observe a ( reddened ) contribution of @xmath14 mjy at times .",
    "for gx  51 this could cause up to 1 magnitude variability .",
    "if star 513 is not the counterpart of gx  51 , the counterpart must have been @xmath152.5 magnitudes fainter in the k band at the time of our observations .",
    "future spectroscopic observations and/or the detection of variability should confirm star 513 as the counterpart .    to conclude , we have most likely identified the ir counterpart of the bright z - type x - ray source gx  51 based upon positional coincidence with the radio counterpart , an identification which is supported by marginal evidence for excess br@xmath0 emission .",
    "we have discussed the possible origins of ir emission in this system and in the other z sources ( and gx  13 + 1 ) , and suggest that gx  51 may contain a kiii mass donor .",

    "particle physics and astronomy research council .",
    "the data reported here were obtained as part of the ukirt service programme .",
