    "the tevatron is doing very well and recently has reached the record peak luminosity of @xmath6 , which is a design goal of run ii .",

    "the results presented here are still at the engineering stage and much improved analyses with full datasets will emerge soon .",
    "the experimental signature considered is @xmath9 with @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , giving final states with one high-@xmath13 lepton , large missing transverse energy ( @xmath14 ) due to the undetected neutrino , and two @xmath8 jets .",
    "the ability to tag @xmath8 jets using a secondary vertex detection with high efficiency and a low mistag rate is vital for searching for the decay of @xmath12 . both cdf and d0 select the @xmath8-tagged @xmath15 2 jet events since it is expected to contain most of the signal , while @xmath8-tagged @xmath16 jet events are dominated by @xmath17 decays .",
    "cdf observed 62 events with at least one @xmath8-tagged jet , consistent with the background expectation of @xmath18 events , which are predominately from @xmath19 , @xmath20 , mistags , and @xmath17 decays .",

    "for anomalous production of @xmath19-like or top - like events .      for the higgs mass above 130 gev / c@xmath3 ,",
    "the predominant decay mode of higgs boson is to a pair of w bosons , which offers an additional promising signature to look for higgs by taking full advantage of large inclusive higgs production with the decay @xmath24 .",
    "we select the events with two opposite - sign high momentum lepton and large missing transverse energy . in order to reduce the significant @xmath25 background ,",
    "we exploit the spin correlations of @xmath26 , which tends to produce the leptons close together . no signal is found and both cdf and d0 set a limit of 5.6 pb for the higgs production cross section times branching ratio at 95% c.l . as a function of higgs mass , as shown in figure  [ fig : ww ] , along with predictions from the standard model and alternative models ( topcolor  @xcite and 4th generation  @xcite ) .     at 95% c.l . together with expectations from standard model higgs boson production and alternative models .",
    ", width=384 ]      in the context of the minimal super - symmetric standard model ( mssm ) the higgs sector has two doublets , one coupling to up - type quarks and the other to down - type quarks .",
    "there are five physical higgs boson states , denoted @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the masses and couplings of the higgses are determined by two parameters , usually taken to be @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( the ratio of the vacuum expectation value of the two higgs doublets ) , with corrections from the scalar top mixing parameters . in the case of large @xmath32",
    ", there is an enhancement of @xmath33 for the production of @xmath34 relative to the sm rate .",
    "this leads to distinct signature of four @xmath8 jets in the final states including two b s from higgs decay .",
    "d0 performed a search for neutral higgs using approximately 130 pb@xmath0 of multi - jet sample .",
    "after optimization , they select events containing 3 or 4 jets and required that at least three of jets be tagged",
    ". the invariant mass distribution of two leading @xmath8-tagged jets are consistent with the main backgrounds from qcd , fake tags , and @xmath17 .",
    "there is no evidence of signal found in the plot , which excludes the value of @xmath35 at 95% c.l . in the region of @xmath31 between 90 and 150",

    "the events are required to have one isolated lepton ( @xmath36 for electron and @xmath37 gev / c for muon ) and one identified hadronic tau candidate .",

    "cdf finds no evidence of signal in the reconstructed visible di - tau mass distribution and is able to set an upper limits at 95% c.l . on the product of higgs production cross - section and its branching fraction to taus as a function of higgs mass  @xcite .      in the standard model",
    "the higgs boson decays mostly to @xmath8-quark , w , or z boson pairs depending on the mass range , while the branching fraction for @xmath40 is too small to be useful for probing sm higgs at the tevatron .",
    "however many extensions of the sm allow enhanced decay of @xmath39 largely due to suppressed couplings of fermions , such as fermiophobic higgs  @xcite or topcolor higgs  @xcite scenarios .",
    "the data used for this analysis were collected with the d0 detector , which corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 191 pb@xmath0 .",
    "the events are selected with two reconstructed em objects with @xmath41 gev in the central calorimeter ( cc ) or end calorimeter ( ec ) in the detector @xmath42 range of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the @xmath13 of the diphoton system is required to be above 35 gev to reduce the di - jet background .",
    "the invariant mass of diphoton distribution for the data are consistent with the predicted backgrounds . in the absence of an evidence for a signal , d0 is able to set an upper 95% c.l .",
    "limit on the diphoton branching ratio ( @xmath45 ) as a function of higgs mass for fermiophobic and topcolor higgs models .",
    "in 2003 , the cdf and d0 collaborations were asked by doe to provide a new estimation of the higgs sensitivity based on current run ii detector performance  @xcite .",
    "the studies focus on a number of important improvements including the detectors , @xmath8-tagging , dijet mass resolution , and the advanced analysis techniques .",
    "the updated integrated luminosity required to discover or exclude the sm higgs , combining all search channels and combining the data from both experiments , is shown in figure  [ fig : lum ] .",
    "the finding is consistent with the susy - higgs workshop report , also shown in the plot  @xcite .",
    "we have not included the impact of systematic uncertainties in the curve yet . controlling the systematic errors ,",
    "especially dijet mass resolution will be important .",
    "the understanding of the higgs sensitivity will improve over time once we get more data , a better understood detector , and more clever ideas , but finding higgs at the tevatron will be challenging . with 5 fb@xmath0 data , the tevatron should be able to observe a 3 @xmath46 excess for higgs mass up to 120 gev / c@xmath3 or exclude the higgs mass up to about @xmath47 gev / c@xmath3 at 95% cl if it is not present . the prospects for an mssm higgs",
