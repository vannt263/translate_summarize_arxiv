    "the study of large scale structure ( lss ) has been of great importance for the advancement of our understanding of the universe , characterising the distribution of structures , such as galaxies and voids , at large scales .",
    "supported by the increasing amount of data from current and future large galaxy surveys , such as the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , wigglez @xcite , the dark energy survey ( des ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hobby - eberly telescope dark energy experiment ( hetdex ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the euclid mission @xcite , in combination with new and more precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the study of the lss has a promising future in terms of shedding light on the nature of the universe .",
    "one of the most important cosmological probes of lss is the signal of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) measured in two - point statistics , such as the correlation function or the power spectrum .",
    "these oscillations occur because small primordial perturbations induce sound waves in the relativistic plasma of the early universe @xcite , but later on at the recombination epoch ( @xmath9 ) , the sound speed suddenly decreases to the point that these waves stop propagating . since the universe has an appreciable fraction of baryons , cosmological theories predict that the bao signal will also be imprinted onto the two - point statistics of the non - relativistic matter as an excess of clustering in the correlation function , or an oscillation in power in the power spectrum , at a given ( fixed ) scale , making it an ideal standard ruler .    in 1999 ,",
    "motivated by the results obtained from cobe of the primary temperature anisotropy in the cmb @xcite , the bao signal was measured for the first time in the cmb , detecting small angle anisotropies in the cmb angular power spectrum , confirming the cosmological predictions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . later on in 2005 , the bao signal was measured in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by @xcite using the spatial correlation function of a spectroscopic subsample of luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) , finding the bao peak at @xmath10mpc ; and in the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by @xcite using the power spectrum .",
    "since bao measurements have proven to be a robust probe for extracting cosmological information , substantial work has been devoted to model and detect the bao signal in two - point statistics and use it for cosmological constraints ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , b ) .",
    "there are two important points related to the usual study of lss using 3d analysis that need to be considered .",
    "first , to work in configuration - space , it is necessary to assume a fiducial cosmological model in order to transform the measured angular positions on the sky and redshifts of galaxies into comoving coordinates or distances , a process which could bias the parameter constraints if not treated carefully ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , in order to obtain a precise measurement of either the correlation function or the power spectrum , usually the whole galaxy sample is used to obtain one measurement , typically averaging over a wide redshift range assuming that the measurement at the mean redshift is representative of the entire sample , washing out information on the redshift evolution of the structures .    even when these two issues are well understood and under control within certain conditions , a simple way to avoid them is by using two - point statistics based only on direct observables , i.e. only angular positions and/or redshifts , such as the angular correlation function @xmath0 or the angular power spectrum @xmath11 .",
    "this is done by dividing the sample into redshift bins , or shells , in order to recover information along the line of sight , which otherwise would be lost due to projection effects . in the last few years",
    "there have been several papers modelling and analysing large galaxy catalogues using angular two - point statistics .",
    "although most of these focus mainly on photometric - redshift galaxy surveys ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , this approach has also been applied to spectroscopic - redshift samples ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "here we focus on the cosmological implications of applying this tomographic approach to a boss - like spectroscopic - redshift galaxy survey , computing @xmath0 in redshift - shells and using this information to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "there are three main advantages of this tomographic approach : ( i ) compared to that of photometric redshifts ( photo - z ) , the higher accuracy of spectroscopic redshifts significantly reduces the overlap between redshift - shells , allowing us to assume that there is no correlation between them due to these uncertainties , and to use thinner shells .",
    "compared to the traditional 3d analysis , ( ii ) as we already mentioned , by using direct observables we do not need to assume a cosmological model in order to compute spatial separations between galaxies , their angular separations will remain unaffected independent of the cosmological model being tested ; ( iii ) by measuring the angular scale of the bao peak imprinted on @xmath0 at many different redshifts , we are basically measuring the angular diameter distance @xmath1 at several redshifts instead of just one more precise measurement of the average distance @xmath12 at the mean redshift of the sample , giving us more information about the rate at which @xmath13 evolves , putting stronger constraints on the expansion history of the universe .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : sample ] we describe the mock catalogues that we used , how we configured them in redshift - shells , and what information we expect to extract from the technique discussed in this paper . in section [ sec : mod ] we describe the model we use for the angular correlation function measured in redshift shells and its covariance matrix , and describe the test we perform to assess the ability of these models to extract unbiased cosmological constraints . in section [ sec :",
    "boss ] we describe a synthetic dataset constructed using these models , and present a forecast of the accuracy on cosmological constraints expected from applying this tomographic approach to the final boss galaxy catalogue in combination with planck cmb measurements , comparing this with the constraints that would result from the combination of the isotropic bao measurements post - reconstruction on the same catalogue and planck .",
    "we finish with our main conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in section [ sec : lasdamas ] we describe the set of mock catalogues we used for testing our model and the tomographic technique discussed in this paper , and how we configured the catalogues in redshift - shells . in section [ sec : shellsda ] we explain how to measure cosmological distances using @xmath0 in redshift - shells , and what information we expect to extract from these measurements .",

    "we divided each mock catalogue and the random field into redshift - shells to perform our analysis .",
    "thicker shells lower the signal of the bao peak , because it is projected over an increasingly wide range of angular scales given by the deeper sample .",
    "thinner shells increase the bao signal , but decrease the projected number density and therefore decrease the accuracy of the measurements , while increasing the correlation between shells due to rsd effects and the clustering itself . using a spectroscopic - redshift sample ,",
    "any overlap between redshift - shells due to redshift uncertainties can be safely neglected as long as their width is much larger than these uncertainties .",
    "we tested a number of configurations in order to estimate the optimal redshift bin size , considering the strength of the bao signal and the uncertainty in measuring @xmath0 .",
    "for simplicity we ignored any correlation between shells , but , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , cross - correlations should add extra information .",
    "the final configuration for lasdamas consists of @xmath42 shells : @xmath43 low redshift shells of @xmath44 covering the redshift range @xmath45 $ ] , and @xmath46 higher redshift shells of @xmath47 covering the redshift range @xmath48 $ ] .    using the estimator of @xcite",
    ", we computed the angular correlation function @xmath0 in every shell of each mock catalogue and used these measurements to compute the mean @xmath0 of each shell and to estimate its associated covariance matrix .",
    "these measurements only depend on direct observables ( angular positions and redshifts ) and do not require the assumption of a fiducial cosmological model to be computed and thus will remain invariant when considering the constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "[ fig : shells ] shows the mean @xmath0 measured from the 8 shells , amplified by @xmath49 in order to highlight the bao feature , and where the errorbars correspond to the error in the mean .",
    "the dashed lines show the best - fitting model ( described in sections [ sec : modw ] and [ sec : mod3d ] ) for the cosmology of lasdamas , which simultaneously reproduces @xmath0 for every shell .      if we look again carefully at fig .",
    "[ fig : shells ] , it can be seen that the bao peak in @xmath0 is located at different angular scales depending on the redshift shell , i.e. depending on the distance to that shell ; this is the key feature that we want to exploit .",
    "let us say that we are only measuring the angular position @xmath51 of the bao peak , then for a given redshift @xmath52 we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the sound horizon at the drag redshift , and @xmath13 is the angular diameter distance given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the comoving distance to redshift @xmath57 .",
    "using the fact that the sound horizon corresponds to a fixed scale , in linear theory we can relate its angular scale as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is defined as @xmath60 then , we can extend this relation to the angular correlation function of two different shells as @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dacorr ] we show the mean @xmath0 measured in three different redshift - shells of lasdamas , where two of them have been rescaled using as reference the third one following eq .",

    "the error bars have been omitted for clarity .",
    "it can be seen that they match remarkably well on applying the simple relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphawth ] ) , despite the fact that there are some small differences in their shape due to non - linear evolution of the density field and rsd , which are discussed in section [ sec : mod ] .",
    "the technique discussed in this paper is based on the following idea : if we have @xmath62 measurements of @xmath0 in different redshift shells , in practice we have @xmath63 measurements of @xmath64 for @xmath65 , constraining the rate at which the angular diameter distance can evolve over the redshift range being tested .",
    "here we describe our model of the two - point angular correlation function used to extract information from the full shape of @xmath0 without introducing systematic errors , starting in section [ sec : modw ] from the description of its analytical model in thin redshift shells and the distortion effects that have to be taken into account , then going on to describe in section [ sec : mod3d ] how to include such effects by modelling the anisotropic two - point spatial correlation function . in section [ sec : theocov ] we briefly describe the model for the covariance matrix of @xmath0 and compare it with the ones measured from the mock catalogues .",

    "that is , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the comoving pair separation , and @xmath77 is the angular separation on the sky .",

    "it can be seen that the rsd corrections have the strongest effects on the full shape of @xmath0 , but are not enough to describe the damping effects on the bao peak without including non - linear corrections , which also slightly move the centroid of the peak towards smaller scales . in order to fully describe the shape of @xmath0 including these effects",
    ", we replaced the spatial correlation function in equation ( [ eq : wxi1 ] ) by the anisotropic two - dimensional spatial correlation function described in section [ sec : mod3d ] . using this , the model for @xmath0",

    "measurements are not done over a single angle @xmath77 , but correspond to the average over a bin centred on @xmath77 with a bin - width @xmath82 . in order to avoid systematic effects such as a shift in the bao peak determination , we consider in our analysis the bin - averaged angular correlation function , evaluated at the bin @xmath83 , given by    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the solid angle given by @xmath86      here we describe our model for the anisotropic 3d clustering in redshift - space . in order to take into account the non - linear evolution of the density field ,",

    "unlike the traditional 3d analysis , where it is assumed that evolving quantities such as the galaxy bias @xmath88 are constant within the sample , in our analysis we need to allow for their evolution .",
    "nevertheless , since each shell is covering a small redshift range , we can neglect the evolution of the density field within a shell , allowing us to evaluate terms such as @xmath88 and the growth factor @xmath96 at the mean redshift of the shell @xmath97 .",
    "we emphasise that this does not mean that the evolution of the whole sample is negligible , it needs to be considered from shell to shell . with this in mind , starting from the galaxy bias @xmath88 in the mock catalogues , since theoretical models favour smooth variations in @xmath88 as a function of redshift for galaxy samples with a fixed selection ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we assume a linear redshift evolution in which the value of @xmath88 for a given shell is @xmath98 where now @xmath99 and @xmath100 are our free parameters for the galaxy bias , and @xmath101 is some reference redshift .",
