    "in the light of the randall - sundrum ( rs ) braneworld paradigm @xcite , the cosmological evolution of the universe would acquire important modifications at early times with respect to the standard lore provided by the friedmann equation of general relativity @xcite ( an exhaustive study of the phase space of the new cosmological models can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "the new friedmann - like equation has now contributions that are quadratic in the density , dark - radiation contributions and possibly even other types of dark contributions ( coming for example from a fundamental electromagnetic field in the bulk @xcite ) .",
    "this same paradigm , with the characteristic presence of extra dimensions , naturally suggests that we should look for further modifications to the generalized friedmann equation caused by the existence of a gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term in the field equations . in five dimensions , the most general geometric field equations of the form @xmath0 , with @xmath1 a symmetric and conserved tensor constructed by using the metric and its first and second derivatives only ,",
    "is a linear combination of the metric tensor itself , the einstein tensor and the lanczos tensor ( or gb term )  @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", the value of the three coefficients of this combination , basically , the cosmological constant , newton s constant and the @xmath2 constant ( to be defined later ) respectively , are parameters to be determined experimentally .",
    "the gb term has particular relevance when considering the string - inspired nature of the rs proposal . in string theory",
    ", the gb term appears as the first higher curvature correction to einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "possible consequences of the gb interactions on cosmological inflation have already been considered in  @xcite .",
    "other analysis concerning different aspects of gb corrections to braneworld physics can be found in @xcite@xcite ( this is not intended to be an exhaustive list ) .    in trying to generalize the thin - shell cosmological models to incorporate the effects of a gb term it has been some controversy .",
    "first , it was claimed that the gb equations were not well defined in the distributional sense required by the thin - shell formalism @xcite .",
    "it would be necessary to study the microphysics to solve the ambiguities that would arise .",
    "however , later , in references @xcite@xcite , it was assumed that the particular structure of the gb lagrangian ( linear in second order derivatives ) posed no problems in the distributional limit ( at least in models with @xmath3 symmetry ) . remarkably , the results obtained in those paper were not consistent with each other .",
    "the generalized friedmann equation found in papers @xcite@xcite ( quadratic on the brane density @xmath4 ) is different from that found in papers @xcite@xcite ( with a complicated dependence on @xmath4 coming from obtaining the real root of a cubic equation ) .",
    "more recently , there has been an argument @xcite based on the form of the surface term in gb ( see @xcite ) that strongly support this later complicated @xmath4 dependence ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the cosmological behaviour of shells ( or branes ) that are thin but still of a finite thickness @xmath5 . in this way",
    "we want to shed some light on how the zero thickness is attained in the presence of gb interactions .",
    "this limit has been studied for einstein gravity in @xcite .",
    "thick shells in the context of gb interactions have been already studied in @xcite and @xcite , but with a focus on different aspects than those in this paper .",
    "the conclusion of our analysis here is twofold . on the one side ,",
    "our results show that the generalized friedmann equation in  @xcite@xcite can be found by using a completely general procedure , in which the energy density of the brane in the thin - limit is related to the averaged density . instead",
    ", the equation in  @xcite@xcite can only be found for specific geometric configurations and with a procedure in which the energy density of the brane in the thin - limit comes from the value of the boundary density in the thick - brane model . on the other side",
    ", we argue that the information lost when treating a real thin shell as infinitely thin is in a sense larger in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity than in the analogous situation in standard general relativity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we build thick - shell models for static branes ( direct generalization of the rs model @xcite ) .",
    "this provides a simple situation in which the main ideas of the paper can already be seen . for clarity",
    ", we will separate the einstein and einstein - gauss - bonnet cases .",
    "section [ s : dynamic ] will deal with the dynamical cosmological case .",
    "finally , we will make a brief summary of the results found in section [ s : summary ] .",
    "general formulae for the construction of the field equations are given in the appendix .",
    "to fix ideas and notation let us first describe the simple case in which we have a static thick brane in an anti - de sitter ( ads ) bulk .",
    "we take an ansatz for the metric of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the four - dimensional minkowski metric . comparing with the formulas given in appendix  [ appa ] [ in particular equation  ( [ themetric ] ) ] this means taking @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 the 5-dimensional bulk metric . here",
    ", @xmath17 denotes the bulk gravitational coupling constant and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent respectively the energy density , the longitudinal pressure and the transverse pressure , and are taken to depend only on @xmath21 .",
    "the einstein equations @xmath22 with a negative cosmological constant , @xmath23 , result on the following independent equations for the metric function @xmath24 : @xmath25 for convenience , we will hide the @xmath26 dependence inside the matter magnitudes , @xmath27 , etc .",
    "we also consider a @xmath3-symmetric geometry around @xmath28 .",
    "the brane extend in thickness from @xmath29 to @xmath30 . outside this region @xmath31 , so we have a purely ads spacetime : @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an irrelevant constant . the junction conditions at @xmath37 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ cindm ] ) and ( [ cincm ] ) tell us that @xmath38 from here and using ( [ eins2 ] ) we deduce that the transversal pressure is zero at the brane boundaries @xmath39 . since we are imposing a @xmath3-symmetry with @xmath28 as _ fixed point _",
    ", hereafter we will only specify the value of the different functions in the interval @xmath40 .",
    "the function @xmath41 is odd and therefore interpolates from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "if in addition we ask for the null - energy condition @xmath44 to be satisfied everywhere inside the brane , then @xmath20 has to be a negative and monotonically decreasing function from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "this condition will turn to be fundamental in defining a thin - shell limit .    by isolating @xmath47 from equations ( [ eins1 ] ) and ( [ eins2 ] )",
    "we can relate the total bending of the geometry on passing through the brane with its total @xmath48 @xmath49 at this stage of generality , one can create different one - parameter families of thick - brane versions of the randall - sundrum thin brane geometry , by parameterizing each member of a given family by its thickness @xmath5 .",
    "the only requirement needed to do this is that the value of the previous integral must be kept fixed independently of the thickness of the particular thick - brane geometry .",
    "thus , each particular family can be seen as a regularization of dirac s delta distribution .",
    "we can realize that , provided the condition @xmath50 is satisfied , there exists a constant @xmath51 , independent of the thickness @xmath5 , such that @xmath52 , that is , the profile for @xmath20 is bounded and will not blow up in the thin - shell limit .",
    "therefore , in the limit in which the thickness of the branes goes to zero , @xmath53 , the integral of @xmath20 goes to zero with the thickness .",
    "( strictly speaking , the thin - shell limit is reached when @xmath54 but throughout this paper we are going to maintain @xmath55 constant . ) instead , the profile of @xmath18 has to develop arbitrarily large values in order to fulfil @xmath56    in the thin - shell limit , we can think of einstein s equations as providing a relation between the characteristics of the density profile and the shape of the internal geometry .",
    "a very complicated density profile will have associated a very complicated function @xmath24 .",
    "physically we can argue that when a shell becomes very thin one does not care about its internal structure and , therefore , one tries to describe it in the most simple terms .",
    "but what it is exactly the meaning of simple ? here",
    "we will adopt two different definitions of simple : the first one is to consider that the internal density is distributed homogeneously throughout the shell when the shell becomes very thin .",
    "the second case is to consider that the profile for @xmath41 is such that it interpolates from @xmath42 to @xmath43 through a straight line , or what is the same , that the internal profile of @xmath47 is constant .",
    "again , we require this for very thin shells .",
    "this geometric prescription is equivalent to asking for a constant internal scalar curvature , since @xmath57 and for every thin shell the term @xmath58 is negligible with respect to the constant @xmath47 term .",
    "hereafter , we will use indistinctly the names _ straight interpolation _ or _",
    "constant curvature _ for these models . in building arbitrarily thin braneworld models",
    ", one needs that the profiles for the internal density @xmath18 and the internal @xmath47 acquire arbitrarily high values ( they will become distributions in the limit of strictly zero thickness ) . in the first of the two simple models described",
    ", the simplicity applies to the blowing up parts of the matter content ; in the second , the simplicity applies to the blowing up parts of the geometry . from the physical point of view advocated in the introduction ,",
    "these simple profiles are those that do not involve losing information in the process of taking the limit of strictly zero thickness .",
    "let us analyze both cases independently .",
    "let us first define for convenience @xmath59 as a scale invariant coordinate inside the brane .",
    "then , mathematically , the idea that the density profile , which we will assume to be analytic inside the brane for simplicity , becomes constant in the thin - shell limit can be expressed as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 for these density profiles , the einstein equations in the thin - shell limit tell us that @xmath62 from here we get the profile for @xmath41 : @xmath63 notice that this expression only makes sense for @xmath64 , but this is just the regime we are interested in .",
    "we have to impose now the boundary condition @xmath65 to the previous expression ( [ apri ] ) @xmath66 in this manner , we have implicitly determined the form of the function @xmath67 . in the limit",
    "in which @xmath53 with @xmath68 , we find the following relation @xmath69 this condition is just what we expected from the average condition ( [ average ] ) .      in this case , the mathematical idea that in thin - shell limit the profile for @xmath41 corresponds to a straight interpolation , can be formulated as @xmath70 with @xmath71 for these geometries we find that the associated profiles for @xmath20 and @xmath18 in the thin - shell limit have the following form @xmath72 where here and along this paper @xmath73 will denote functions that vanish in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "now , from this density profile we can see that @xmath74 as we expected .",
    "moreover , we can see that the boundary value of the density satisfies @xmath75 in the thin shell limit , which is the same condition satisfied by the averaged density , @xmath76 .",
    "an additional interesting observation for what follows is the following : the sets of profiles that yield constant density in the thin - shell limit ( [ constant - density - est ] ) and straight interpolation for the geometric profile ( [ straight - interpolation ] ) coincide .",
    "therefore , in the thin - shell limit one can assume at the same time a constant internal structure for the density and a straight - interpolation for the geometry .",
    "let us move now to the analysis of the same ideas in the presence of the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "the einstein - gauss - bonnet lagrangian is @xmath77,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath78 now , the field equations deduced from this lagrangian are @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the lanczos tensor @xcite : @xmath81 for the ansatz ( [ brane ] ) we obtain [ compare with equations ( [ ttcom]-[yycom ] ) in appendix  [ appa ] ] @xmath82 the junction conditions for the geometry are the same as before ( [ e - junctions ] ) , implying again the vanishing of the transversal pressure at the boundaries , @xmath83 .    in the outside region the solution is a pure ads spacetime but with a modified length scale @xmath84 now , isolating @xmath47 from  ( [ egb - equations - rho ] ) and  ( [ egb - equations - pt ] ) we can relate the total bending of the geometry on passing through the brane with the integral of @xmath48 @xmath85 again , if the condition @xmath50 is fulfilled throughout the brane we will have that in the thin shell limit @xmath86 at this point we can pursue this analysis in the two simple cases of constant density profile and straight interpolation .",
    "following the same steps as before for a constant density profile ( [ constant - density - est])-([condi ] ) , the equation that one has to solve in the thin - shell limit is @xmath87 introducing the notation @xmath88 we reduce this equation to the following integral @xmath89 the result of performing the integration is @xmath90,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 are @xmath92\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , by imposing the boundary condition @xmath93,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find the appropriate form for @xmath67 . with a lengthy but straightforward calculation",
    "we can check that in the limit @xmath53 , @xmath94 , we have @xmath95 in agreement with condition ( [ gb - average - condition ] ) .",
    "using this same asymptotic expansion , we can see that , in the thin - shell limit , the profile for @xmath96 satisfies @xmath97 recursively , one can create a taylor expansion for @xmath96 .",
    "the first two terms are @xmath98 by differentiating this expression we find @xmath99 now , contrarily to what happens in einstein theory , this profile does not correspond to the set considered in the straight interpolation before ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . by looking at ( [ straight - interpolation ] ) we can identify @xmath100 then , we can see that @xmath101 the coefficients @xmath102 do not satisfy the conditions in ( [ straight - interpolation - cond ] ) .",
    "therefore , unlike the energy density , the scalar of curvature does not have a constant profile .",
    "as in the einstein case , the straight interpolation profile for @xmath47 corresponds to @xmath103 with @xmath104 from here we can deduce the associated profiles for @xmath20 and @xmath18 by substituting on ( [ egb - equations - rho ] ) and ( [ egb - equations - pt ] ) .    in the limit @xmath105 , the dominant part in the density profile is @xmath106 identifying @xmath107 we find that @xmath108 therefore , even in the thin shell limit a straight interpolation in the geometry does not correspond to a constant density profile ( see fig.2 ) . in the presence of a gauss - bonnet term",
    "it is not compatible to ascribe to have a simple description for the interior density profile and for the geometric warp factor at the same time . in the limit of strictly zero thickness ( distributional limit ) one",
    "will unavoidably lose some information on the combined matter - geometry system .    to finish this section",
    "let us make an additional observation . from expressions ( [ straight - interpolation2 ] ) and ( [ straight - interpolation2-cond ] )",
    ", we can see that @xmath109 using this property in  ( [ egb - equations - rho],[egb - equations - pt ] ) @xmath110 and evaluating at @xmath111 we find @xmath112 we can see that contrarily to what happens in the einstein case , this condition is different from the averaged condition ( [ gb - average - condition ] ) @xmath113 therefore , the averaged density and the boundary density are different , and this is independent of the brane thickness . for this simple model , in thin - shell limit one can define two different internal density parameters characterizing the thin brane .",
    "one represents the total averaged internal density and can be defined as @xmath114 the other represents an internal density parameter calculated by extrapolating to the interior the value of the density on the boundary .",
    "this density can be defined as @xmath115 the junction conditions for a thin shell given in @xcite , corresponds to the averaged condition ( [ gb - average - condition ] ) or ( [ average3 ] ) and therefore relate the total bending of the geometry in passing through the brane with its total averaged density .",
    "instead , the particular condition analyzed for the boundary value of @xmath116 ( [ boundary - value ] ) yields in the thin - shell limit the junction condition in @xcite .",
    "this condition is only considering information about the boundary value of the density and not about its average .    as a summary",
    ", what these analysis suggest is that in the presence of the gauss - bonnet term we can not forget the interior structure of the brane , by modelling it by a simple model , even in the thin - shell limit .",
    "we will see again this feature in the next section on the cosmological dynamics of thick shells .",
    "we are now going to study cosmological thick branes . to that end",
    "we will use the class of spacetime metrics given in ( [ themetric ] ) , which contain a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model in every hypersurface @xmath117 , with a matter content described by an energy - momentum tensor of the form ( [ tab ] ) .",
    "we consider the additional assumption of a _",
    "static _ fifth dimension : @xmath118 . we can rescale the coordinate @xmath21 in such a way that @xmath119 .",
    "then , the line element ( [ themetric ] ) becomes @xmath120 in appendix  [ appa ] we show that the @xmath121component of the einstein - gauss - bonnet field equations , for the case with a well - defined limit in einstein gravity , leads to the equation  ( [ keyrel ] ) . in our case",
    "it implies the following relation : @xmath122 in this situation the rest of field equations can be written in the form given in  ( [ ttcom],[ijcom],[yycom ] ) . in our case",
    "they become used here is one half the one used in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath123 ' = \\frac{1}{6}(a^4)'\\rho   \\ , , \\label{ttc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath124 ' - { \\left[a^4\\left(\\phi+2\\alpha\\phi^2+\\frac{1}{\\ell^2}\\right)\\right]^{\\cdot}\\ , } ' = 2\\dot{a}a'a^2p_l\\ , , \\label{ijc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath123^\\cdot = -\\frac{1}{6}(a^4)^\\cdot p_t \\ , , \\label{yyc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now @xmath125 is given by @xmath126 where we have identified the first term with the square of the hubble function associated with each @xmath127 slide , @xmath128 with the assumption @xmath129 , the field equation ( [ ijc ] ) leads to a conservation equation for matter of the same form as in the frw models [ see eq.([5ceq ] ) ] : @xmath130    in the same way we did in the static scenario , we consider here the situation in which there is a @xmath3 symmetry and a fixed proper thickness @xmath5 for the brane .",
    "then one has to solve separately the equations for the _ bulk _ ( @xmath131 ) and the equations for the thick _ brane _ ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the first step has already been done and the result is  @xcite : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a constant that can be identified with the mass of a black hole present in the bulk .",
    "once the solution inside the thick brane has been found one has to impose the junction conditions  ( [ cindm],[cincm ] ) at @xmath135 .",
    "the first thing we can deduce from the junction conditions is that the quantity @xmath125 is continuous across the two boundaries @xmath136 but in general , its transversal derivative , @xmath137 , will be discontinuous .",
    "then , using equation ( [ yyc ] ) it follows that the transversal pressure has to be zero on the boundary , @xmath138 . at the same time , from ( [ yyc ] ) we deduce that we must always have : @xmath139 on the other hand , using again the relation  ( [ keyrel ] ) we find that @xmath140 and then , expanding ( [ ttc ] ) , we get @xmath141    in the limit @xmath105 , the profiles for the density @xmath18 and for @xmath142 blow up , therefore , these dominant terms in expression  ( [ mult ] ) have to be equated .",
    "this results in the following equation @xmath143 in what follows we consider the analysis of the einstein and einstein - gauss - bonnet theories separately .      in einstein gravity",
    "it is not difficult to write down an equation describing the dynamics of every layer in the interior of a thick shell . to that end",
    "we will take @xmath144 in the equations above . by integrating ( [ ttc ] ) over the interval @xmath145 and using ( [ intm],[00-thin - limit ] ) we arrive at @xmath146 a particular layer of matter inside the shell , located at @xmath147 , can be seen as separating an internal spacetime from a piece of external spacetime . from the previous equation we can see that the cosmological evolution of each layer @xmath147 in the thick shell depends on the balance between the integrated density beyond the layer ( external spacetime ) and a weighted contribution of the integrated density in the internal spacetime .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of each shell layer will be influenced by the particular characteristics of the internal density profile inside the shell .",
    "however , by looking at this same equation we can see that the dynamics of the boundary layer @xmath148 is only influenced by the total integrated density throughout the shell : @xmath149 this is the modified friedmann equation for the cosmological evolution of the brane @xcite .    in the same manner as we proceeded with static shells ,",
    "let us analyze the case in which the density profile tends to a ( time - dependent ) constant in the thin - shell limit : @xmath150 when @xmath144 , equation  ( [ 00-thin - limit ] ) tells us that if the density profile depends only on @xmath151 in the thin - shell limit , then , in this same limit , the blowing up part of the geometry @xmath152 is also constant through the brane interior , describing what we called before a straight interpolation .",
    "a simple density profile amounts to a simple and equivalent geometric profile and vice - versa . in this same case but",
    "including the gauss - bonnet term , @xmath153 , the geometrical factor @xmath152 will exhibit a non trivial profile in @xmath21 , even in the thin - shell limit .",
    "we will see this fact in more detail in the next subsection .",
    "now , in the case in which @xmath18 depends only on time , equation  ( [ layer - einstein ] ) reads @xmath154 from equation  ( [ 00-thin - limit ] ) we deduce that @xmath155 and integrating we obtain @xmath156 ( remember that @xmath59 ) .",
    "therefore , in the lowest order in @xmath5 we have an equation for the internal geometry of the following form @xmath157 which is exactly the standard braneworld generalized friedmann equation  @xcite .",
    "in the general einstein - gauss - bonnet case , equation  ( [ 00-thin - limit ] ) can be written as @xmath158\\left({a ' \\over a}\\right ) ' -4\\alpha \\left({a ' \\over a}\\right)^2 \\left({a ' \\over a}\\right ) ' = -{1 \\over 3}\\rho .",

    "now , by squaring ( [ gb - blowup ] ) and substituting the previous root we arrive to a cubic equation for @xmath165 first found in  @xcite .",

    "a necessary condition to have a straight interpolation for the geometry is that @xmath180 . to check whether or not a simple density profile corresponds to a simple geometrical profile we can therefore try to solve the previous equation by separation of variables .",
    "it is not difficult to see that in order to find a solution with a well defined einstein limit we need that @xmath181 where @xmath182 is a constant that can be absorbed into the function @xmath183 , so we will take it to be @xmath184 . in this way we will recover the anti - de sitter and de sitter solutions for the brane ( depending on the sign of the effective four - dimensional cosmological constant ) . to find the specific @xmath21 profile we have to solve @xmath185}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "this equation can be integrated to get @xmath186 for our proposes the specific solution of this cubic equation is not important .",
    "what we want to point out is that the solution does not correspond to a straight interpolation as it happened in the einstein case .",
    "so , in general , simple solutions for the matter profile lead to non trivial profiles for the scalar curvature even in the thin - shell limit .",
    "let us see now what happens when we take a simple model for the geometry , the straight interpolation model : @xmath187 from equation  ( [ gb - expanded ] ) we can deduce the density profile in this situation @xmath188 \\left({b \\over a_0}\\right)-12\\alpha\\left({b \\over a_0}\\right)^3 z^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as in the static case , even for very small thickness the density profile has now a non - trivial structure",

    "\\label{cubic2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , following the same steps that we followed previously but using this condition instead of ( [ gb - blowup ] ) we arrive at a cosmological generalized friedmann equation @xcite different from that in  @xcite in its form and in the fact that it depends on the quantity associated with the boundary value of the energy density , @xmath190 , instead of the value associated with the average of the energy density , @xmath191 .",
    "remarkably , the cubic equation that results from combining the last equation  ( [ cubic2 ] ) with the boundary condition  ( [ bcegb ] ) becomes in this case linear .",
    "that is , the coefficients of the terms quadratic and cubic in @xmath165 vanish  @xcite .",
    "the modified friedmann equation found in this case is : @xmath192 in contrast with the modified friedmann equation  ( [ feqchar ] ) , which was obtained by using a completely general procedure , in order to obtain this equation we had to use a procedure which required to consider an extra assumption , namely equation  ( [ extraas ] ) , and hence , it will not work for profiles of the metric function @xmath193 that do not satisfy these requirements or equivalent ones . on the other hand , by looking at the developments here presented , we can conclude that the different results found in the literature for the dynamics of a distributional shell have their origin in the additional internal richness introduced in the brane by the presence of the gb term .",
    "we have analyzed and compared how the thin shell limit of static and cosmological braneworld models is attained in einstein and einstein - gauss - bonnet gravitational theories .",
    "we have seen that the generalized friedmann equation proposed in  @xcite is always valid and relates the dynamical behaviour of the shell s boundary with its total internal density ( obtained by integrating transversally the density profile ) .",
    "instead , the generalized friedmann equation proposed in  @xcite relates the dynamical behaviour of the shell s boundary with the boundary value of the density within the brane .",

    "einstein equations in these models transfer the blowing up contributions of the thin - shell internal density profile to the structure of the internal geometry in a faithful way .",
    "if we do nt know the internal structure of the shell we can always model it in simple terms by assuming an ( almost ) constant density profile and an ( almost ) constant internal curvature . however , the gb term makes incompatible to have both magnitudes ( almost ) constant .",
    "if the density is ( almost ) constant , then the curvature is not , and vice - versa .",
