    "dynamic holography relies on the ability of the refractive index of a nonlinear media to locally change under the action of light , i.e.  under the so - called photorefractive response .",
    "the most conventional scheme for dynamic holographic applications consists in the formation of a fringe interference pattern between the interacting waves ( the light grating ) , which creates the refractive index grating . during the wave interaction ,",
    "these are the same waves which create the grating pattern and diffract on this grating .",
    "there exist many applications based on dynamic holography with photorefractive crystals @xcite .    in the four - wave mixing model , the grating , i.e. the modulation of the refractive index induced by the light interference pattern ,",
    "is created by two pairs of co - propagating waves , 12 and 34 .",
    "let us denote @xmath3 the complex amplitudes of the four waves , @xmath4 the complex amplitude of the index grating , @xmath2 the characteristic time of the evolution , @xmath5 the total intensity of light ( a real positive constant ) , @xmath6 the photorefractive coupling ( a complex constant ) .",
    "the four - wave mixing model is the system of five complex partial differential equations obeyed by these five complex amplitudes  @xcite ( bar denotes complex conjugation ) @xmath7 the correspondence of notation with ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath8    at present time , no analytic solution is known to this system , except a stationary solution in which the grating amplitude has a pulse profile  @xcite , @xmath9 the purpose of this short article is to investigate the structure of the singularities of the time - dependent solutions ( @xmath10 ) in order to find , in a forthcoming paper , closed form analytic solutions by making suitable assumptions dictated by the singularity structure .    the first four equations ( [ eq4wm ] ) , which do not depend on @xmath11 , admit six quadratic first integrals",
    ". two of them , @xmath12 allow us to represent the four complex amplitudes @xmath13 with two real functions @xmath14 of @xmath15 and six real functions @xmath16 of @xmath17 , @xmath18 the four other quadratic first integrals are pairwise complex conjugate @xmath19 and constrained by one relation , @xmath20",
    "the dependent variables @xmath21 generically present movable singularities , i.e.  singularities whose location in the complex domain depends on the initial conditions .",
    "the study of the behaviour of @xmath21 near these movable singularities is a prerequisite to the possible obtention of closed form analytic solutions to the nonlinear system ( [ eq4wm ] ) , so let us first perform it .",
    "such a study is made by performing the successive steps of the so - called _ painlev test _",
    ", a procedure explained in detail in ref .  @xcite .    the movable singularities of a pde lay on a manifold represented by the equation @xcite @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is an arbitrary function of the independent variables , and @xmath24 an arbitrary movable constant . in order to express the behaviour of the ten dependent variables @xmath25 , it is convenient to introduce an expansion variable @xmath26 @xcite which vanishes as @xmath27 and which is defined by its gradient @xmath28 with the cross - derivative condition @xmath29    since they will be needed later , we give the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath23 , @xmath31^{-1},\\ \\varphi_z \\not=0 , \\label{eqchi } \\\\ & & s=\\lbrace \\varphi;z \\rbrace = \\frac{\\varphi_{zzz}}{\\varphi_z }   - \\frac{3}{2 } \\left(\\frac{\\varphi_{zz } } { \\varphi_z } \\right)^2,\\   c=- \\varphi_t / \\varphi_z .",
    "\\label{eqs } \\label{eqc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the first step is to determine all possible families of noncharacteristic ( i.e.  @xmath32 ) movable singularities , i.e.  all the leading behaviours @xmath33 in which the exponents @xmath34 are not all positive integers . if one assumes that the two terms @xmath35 and @xmath36 have the same singularity order , the ten exponents @xmath34 obey the twelve linear equations , @xmath37 and the ten coefficients @xmath38 obey the ten nonlinear equations @xmath39 therefore the five squared moduli @xmath40 behave like double poles , @xmath41 and the linear system ( [ eqleadingpowers ] ) is solved as @xmath42 in which @xmath43 are to be determined by the nonlinear system ( [ eqleadingcoeffs ] ) .",
    "the first set of relations @xmath44 imply @xmath45    the second set of relations @xmath46 is solved as @xmath47 in which @xmath48 are nonzero functions of @xmath17 to be determined .",
    "finally , the two remaining equations @xmath49 first define @xmath50 as a root of the second degree equation @xmath51 then put one constraint among @xmath52 .    the equation ( [ eqleadingdelta1 ] ) which defines @xmath50 only depends on the argument of @xmath6 , @xmath53 when the photorefractive coupling constant @xmath6 is purely imaginary , the exponent @xmath50 vanishes , otherwise it can take two purely imaginary values @xmath54    to conclude , there generically exist two families ( [ eqleadingbehaviour ] ) of movable singularities , defined by the equations ( [ eqleadingpowerssol ] ) , ( [ eqleadingsolpart1 ] ) , ( [ eqleadingcoeffssol1 ] ) , ( [ eqtworemaining ] ) , i.e. @xmath55 and they depend on four arbitrary complex functions @xmath56 of @xmath17 .",
    "the leading behaviour ( [ eqleadingbehaviour ] ) is the first term of a laurent series @xmath57 and the indices @xmath58 at which arbitrary coefficients enter this expansion are computed as follows .",
    "if one symbolically denotes @xmath59 the ten equations ( [ eq4wm ] ) , one builds the linearized system of ( [ eq4wm ] ) , @xmath60 i.e. @xmath61 at the point ( [ eqleadingbehaviour ] ) , this ten - dimensional linear system displays near @xmath62 a singularity which has the fuchsian type ( * ? ? ?",
    "15 ) , therefore it admits a solution @xmath63 the condition that this solution be nonidentically zero results in the vanishing of a tenth order determinant whose roots @xmath58 , called fuchs indices , take the ten values @xmath64 in the two - wave mixing case , the four roots @xmath65 are to be removed from this list . the necessary condition , required by the painlev test , that all indices be integer is violated when @xmath50 is nonzero , therefore the  model fails the test in this case .",
    "this failure is quite similar to what occurs in the complex cubic ginzburg - landau equation @xcite , and conclusions similar to those of ref .",
    "@xcite can probably be drawn .",
    "let us remark that the fuchs index @xmath66 has multiplicity four , in agreement with the number of arbitrary functions involved in the leading behaviour , see eq .",
    "( [ eqleadingcoeffsol ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath67 of the laurent series ( [ eqlaurent ] ) are computed for @xmath68 by solving a linear system . whenever @xmath58 reaches an integer fuchs index ,",
    "an obstruction may occur , resulting in the introduction of a movable logarithmic branching , and some necessary conditions need to be satisfied in order to avoid it . in the generic case @xmath69",
    ", these obstructions may only arise at @xmath70 , value of a triple fuchs index . in the nongeneric case @xmath71 , in addition to the quadruple index @xmath70",
    ", one must also check the simple index @xmath72 .",
    "the results are as follows .    at @xmath70 ,",
    "whatever be @xmath50 , a movable logarithm exists , unless the following necessary condition is satisfied , @xmath73 since @xmath74 is excluded , the second factor defines a precise dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath17 , hence a similar dependence for @xmath76 and ultimately for the five complex amplitudes _ via _ their laurent expansion ( [ eqlaurent ] ) .",
    "let us find this dependence explicitly .",
    "the general solution of ( [ eqq2cond ] ) is provided by the method of characteristics and is defined implicitly by the relation @xmath77 in which @xmath78 is an arbitrary function of one variable .",
    "the invariant @xmath79 is then defined by the first order linear pde ( [ eqcrossxt ] ) , which reads @xmath80 and admits the general solution @xmath81 in which @xmath82 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we have not been able to prove whether the function @xmath78 is a gauge which can be arbitrarily chosen ( e.g. @xmath83 ) or whether it is essential . if it is essential , there could exist much more intricate solutions than those which we now outline .",
    "when @xmath78 is arbitrary , we have not yet succeeded to integrate the system ( [ eqchixt ] ) for @xmath26 , hence to compute the induced dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath17 . however , if one restricts to a constant value for @xmath78 , which can then be chosen equal to zero , the equation ( [ eqq2c ] ) for @xmath23 integrates as @xmath84 in which @xmath85 is an arbitrary function , and it is straightforward to check that the laurent expansion ( [ eqlaurent ] ) defines the reduction @xmath86 .",
    "as opposed to the stationary reduction @xmath87 , this reduction is noncharacteristic ( i.e.  it does not lower the differential order ) it is defined with a reduced variable of the factorized type @xmath88 , @xmath89 and it depends on the additional real parameter @xmath90 .    to summarize the information obtained from the fuchs index @xmath91 , provided @xmath78 can be arbitrarily chosen , the four - wave mixing model ( [ eq4wm ] ) ( as well as the two - wave mixing model ) admits no single valued dynamical solution other than the possible solutions of the reduction @xmath86 .",
    "when @xmath92 , this ends the painlev test . when @xmath71 , the fuchs index @xmath93 is found to be free of movable logarithms .",
    "finally , the information provided by the painlev test is the following .    1 .   whatever be @xmath6 , and under the mild restriction that @xmath78 can be arbitrarily chosen , no single valued dynamical solution of ( [ eq4wm ] ) exists other than the possible solutions of the reduction @xmath94 .",
    "2 .   for this reduction , two cases must be distinguished .",
    "when @xmath95 , the ten - dimensional ode system ( [ eq4wrreducxi ] ) possesses at most an eight - parameter single valued solution .",
    "when @xmath96 , the system ( [ eq4wrreducxi ] ) passes the painlev test therefore it may admit a ten - parameter single valued solution , which then would be its general solution . finding a lax pair in this case",
    "would considerably help to perform the explicit integration .",
    "similar conclusions apply to the six - dimensional two - wave mixing : the only possibility for a single valued solution is the reduction ( [ eq4wrreducxi ] ) ( with @xmath97 ) , this solution depending on four movable constants for @xmath95 , and six movable constants for @xmath96 .",
    "the present study proves , like for the complex ginzburg - landau equation , that physically relevant analytic solutions quite certainly exist for the four - wave mixing model .",
    "the present counting of the possible arbitrary constants in the solutions displays , as expected , the crucial role of the photorefractive complex constant .",
    "explicit solutions based on the present study will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the results can be used for predicting new phenomena in optical self - diffraction of waves in photorefractive media which use the non - local response as well as for optimization of optical dynamic holographic settings . among these applications",
    "let us quote : ( i ) the formation of a localized grating to increase optical information density ; ( ii ) the methods of all - optical control of output wave characteristics versus input beam intensities and phases ; ( iii ) the optimization of the parameters of optical phase - conjugation ; ( iv ) the use of the new holographic topographic technique to material parameter characterization .",
    "just like similar processes of nonlinear self - action of waves arise in models of optical networks , optical information processing , quantum information processing , interacted neural chains , then various other problems of nonlinear wave interaction can become the subject of further independent research .",
