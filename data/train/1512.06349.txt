    "despite the glorious successes of the standard model of particle physics , the generations of fermion masses remain one of the most fundamental but unsolved problems therein .",
    "these masses are treated as free parameters in the standard model , which seem to be rather dispersed and unrelated and can only be determined experimentally . therefore , it is reasonable to firstly seek some phenomenological relations of these masses in order to reduce the number of free parameters , and this will significantly help us for the future model buildings in and beyond the standard model .    among the existing phenomenological mass relations , an empirical formula suggested by koide three decades ago",
    "@xcite , is one of the most accurate , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the pole masses of three charged leptons : electron , muon , and tauon , respectively . from the current experimental data [ best - fit ( @xmath12 ) ] @xcite : @xmath13 it is straightforward to see the amazing precision of this simple formula , @xmath14 .",
    "{ \\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] besides , it is very interesting to see that @xmath15 lies exactly in the middle of the two extremes of @xmath16 ( exact democracy in lepton mass spectrum ) and @xmath17 ( extreme hierarchy ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although the lepton masses are hierarchical , the exclusion of the smallest mass @xmath9 still makes @xmath15 notably deviate from @xmath6 .",
    "this remarkable precision has aroused in both theorists @xcite and phenomenologists @xcite a longtime interest in the koide formula , but unfortunately the underlying physics remains incomplete .",
    "the previous studies can be classified into three categories : ( 1 ) to explore the possible physical origin of the koide formula ( e.g. in a supersymmetric model @xcite or in an effective field theory @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) to generalize the koide formula from charged leptons to neutrinos and quarks ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite for example ) ; ( 3 ) to examine the energy scale dependence of the koide formula @xcite ( i.e. to check the stability of the koide formula against radiative corrections , with the pole masses replaced by the running masses of fermions ) . in the present paper , we focus on the latter two aspects for two extended koide formulae suggested by kartavtsev in ref .",
    "@xcite . before doing so",
    ", we briefly review the relevant works on the extensions of the koide formula from charged leptons to neutrinos and quarks .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the koide formula was extended to the sectors of neutrinos , up - type , and down - type quarks , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the masses of three neutrinos , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the masses of six quarks .",
    "it was found that these naive extensions of the koide formula failed to be valid , as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , rodejohann and zhang generalized the koide formula to the quark sector in another way , not according to their charges or isospins , but to their masses .",
    "for the light ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and heavy ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) quarks , they separately introduced @xmath34 and found a better accordance with the koide formula , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "recently , kartavtsev proposed a new extension @xcite , including the neutrino masses in the original koide formula , @xmath37 where the sum is democratically over all the six leptons .",
    "since the neutrino masses are tiny compared to those of charged leptons , it is quite possible that the exact ratio @xmath6 could be attained when they are taken into account .",
    "another motivation for this extension is from the quark sector , @xmath38 it will be shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : qua ] that @xmath4 is also very close to @xmath6 and is almost stable in a large range of energy scales , although the mass of each quark varies with the energy scale obviously .",
    "these preliminary successes enlighten us to investigate kartavtsev s extensions of the koide formula in detail , since the naive estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite were still very simple .",
    "we should firstly explore phenomenologically the validity of eqs .",
    "( [ l ] ) and ( [ kq ] ) for both leptons and quarks , and these explorations will be greatly helpful for the relevant model building for the theoretical explanation of the extended koide formulae .",
    "this is the purpose of our present paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sect . [ sec : lep ] , we show that the extended koide formula for leptons is invalid under the constraints from current experimental data .",
    "however , if the uncertainty of the most inaccurate tauon mass is relaxed to about @xmath3 confidence level , the extended koide formula could be satisfied , and the neutrino masses can thus be extracted .",
    "next , in sect .",
    "[ sec : qua ] , we first clarify some different definitions of quark masses and then examine the energy scale dependence of the extended koide formula for the running quark masses .",
    "we find that the extended koide formula holds fairly well in a large range of energy scales .",
    "some relevant conclusions and discussions are shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : dis ] .",
    "in this section , we examine the extended koide formula for leptons .",
    "however , this can only be performed with the masses of all the six leptons known .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of the absolute masses of neutrinos makes this examination impossible .",
    "but on the other hand , thanks to the more and more precise experiments of neutrino oscillations , we have already had two firm constraints of the mass - squared differences of the neutrino mass eigenstates . therefore , if we assume the validity of the extended koide formula for leptons ( i.e @xmath2 exactly ) and regard it as the third constraint , the three neutrino masses may thus be extracted .",
    "based on 3-flavor neutrino mixing , a global analysis @xcite of the current experimental data from the oscillations of the solar , atmospheric , reactor , and accelerator neutrinos indicates [ best - fit ( @xmath12 ) ] : @xmath39 by normal and inverted mass hierarchies , we mean that neutrinos have the mass spectra @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "suppose the extended koide formula is exact for leptons , @xmath42 solving eq .",
    "( [ kl ] ) with the two constraints of the mass - squared differences , we may first determine one of the three neutrino masses ( e.g. @xmath20 ) and then obtain the other two ( @xmath19 and @xmath21 ) . but the direct solving of eq .",
    "( [ kl ] ) is rather inconvenient , so we convert this problem to search the local minimum of @xmath43 , and this is a typical numerical nonlinear optimization problem . in the following ,",
    "we synthetically utilize the nelder ",
    "mead method ( with the shortest runtime ) and the random search method ( with the highest accuracy ) to obtain the neutrino masses with the smallest computational cost .",
    "we start from the normal mass hierarchy . in this circumstance ,",
    "what we face now is to search the minimum of @xmath43 as an objective function of six variables ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) under five constraints : @xmath44 for searching the minimum of @xmath43 , we set the precision of operation to @xmath45 significant figures .",
    "meanwhile , due to the limitations of the nelder  mead method , a computing result has a great possibility to oscillate in the vicinity of a convergence point , so we set the maximal number of iterations to @xmath46 for a single operation .",
    "if the iterations are not successful , the point will be discarded , and the results from this point will be excluded by the checking program . from the operating and checking for @xmath47 random initial points , we eventually obtain @xmath48 successful convergence points , and the first @xmath49 minima of @xmath43 and the corresponding neutrino masses are sorted in tab .",
    "[ leptons ] .",
    ".the first 10 minima of @xmath43 and the corresponding neutrino masses from the extended koide formula in the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "the values of @xmath43 are greatly larger than the precision of operation , meaning that the extended koide formula for leptons is unsuccessful under the constraints from current experimental data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we find from tab .",
    "[ quarks ] that in a sizable range of energy scales from gev to @xmath5 gev , @xmath50 is rather insensitive to the running effects of quark masses .",
    "this insensitivity should be substantially attributed to the large mass hierarchy in the quark sector .",
    "moreover , @xmath50 is always slightly larger than @xmath6 at all energy scales , indicating the impossibility to extend the koide formula to the running quark masses",
    ". but the discrepancies between @xmath50 and @xmath6 are only about @xmath7 , much smaller than the various attempts in eqs .",
    "( [ li ] ) or ( [ zhang ] ) . in this sense ,",
    "kartavtsev s extended koide formula for quarks is a rather good choice .",
    "in addition , the uncertainties of @xmath50 at different energy scales are almost the same , but this is not unexpected , as the uncertainty of @xmath50 is mainly from the uncertainty of the heaviest @xmath33 quark mass .",
    "besides , we do not find that @xmath50 crosses @xmath6 at some particular energy scale @xmath51 , as claimed by kartavtsev in ref .",
    "@xcite , since this cross was naively estimated from the data in eq .",
    "( [ qm ] ) .",
    "but as we have explained above , these values of quark masses in eq .",
    "( [ qm ] ) have different definitions and can not be consulted simultaneously .",
    "the stability of @xmath50 against the running effects is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ k ] .     in the extended koide formula as the function of energy scales .",
    "due to the huge differences between these energy scales , we arrange them equidistantly on the @xmath52-axis .",
    "@xmath50 is found to be almost stable in a huge range of energy scales from gev to @xmath5 gev . ]",
    "the standard model of particle physics has achieved triumphant successes in the last five decades . however , one of the most crucial shortcomings therein is a large number of free parameters , including twelve fermion masses .",
    "any reduction of this number will pave a way for our comprehension of the underlying flavor physics .",
    "the koide formula is one of the appealing attempts in this direction .",
    "unfortunately , this formula only associates the masses of three charged leptons , but not of all the twelve flavors of fermions .",
    "however , charged leptons should not be particular in fermions , so the idea to extend the original koide formula , including all leptons and quarks on an equal footing , is thus very natural and desirable .",
    "kartavtsev s extensions @xcite in eqs .",
    "( [ l ] ) and ( [ kq ] ) treated six leptons and quarks in a totally democratic manner , with a maximal @xmath53 permutation symmetry , and a preliminary estimate indicated a certain plausibility of these extensions .    in the present paper , we explore kartavtsev s extended koide formulae for both leptons and quarks at length .",
    "for the lepton sector , it proves that @xmath54 can not be equal to @xmath6 exactly with the current experimental data of the charged lepton masses and the mass - squared differences of neutrinos within @xmath55 confidence level .",
    "then , our strategy is to assume the rigorous validity of the extended koide formula for leptons and relax the uncertainty of the most inaccurate tauon mass @xmath11 . by this means , the neutrino masses can be extracted from the extended koide formula , if the uncertainty of @xmath11 is relaxed to about @xmath3 confidence level in both the normal and inverted mass hierarchies .",
    "the central values for three neutrino masses read : @xmath56 ev , @xmath57 ev , @xmath58 ev ( normal hierarchy ) , and @xmath59 ev , @xmath60 ev , @xmath61 ev ( inverted hierarchy ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the most stringent upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses from the measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature spectra from the wmap and planck satellite experiments : @xmath62 ev ( @xmath63 confidence level ) @xcite , and also from the data combined with the baryon acoustic oscillations : @xmath64 ev ( @xmath63 confidence level ) @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , even if the neutrino masses increase near this cosmological bound ( e.g. @xmath65 ev ) , with the constraints in eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) , the discrepancies between @xmath54 and @xmath6 almost remain unchanged : @xmath66 for the normal mass hierarchy and @xmath67 for the inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "this is understandable , as the uncertainty of @xmath54 mainly comes from the uncertainties of charged leptons .    for the quark sector",
    ", the various definitions of quark masses greatly complicate the situation .",
    "the pole masses in the koide formula become ill - defined for the light quarks , due to the non - perturbative effects in qcd at low energies .",
    "therefore , the exploration of the extended koide formula should only be implemented for the running quark masses .",
    "we find that the running parameter @xmath50 is almost stable in a very large range of energy scales from gev to @xmath5 gev , mainly as a result of the large mass hierarchy in the quark sector .",
    "however , @xmath50 is always slightly larger than @xmath6 , meaning the invalidity of the extended koide formula for the running quark masses , but this deviation is merely about @xmath7 .",
    "we omit the discussion of the running behavior of the extended koide formula in the lepton sector , as the running effects are negligibly tiny because the lepton mass ratios are rather insensitive to radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "below , we give some general discussions on the koide formula .",
    "the mystery of the koide formula is two - fold .",
    "the first is its surprising simplicity and accuracy , but only for charged leptons .",
    "the inclusion of neutrinos is a reasonable balance between the charged and uncharged leptons , but this inclusion is meaningful only if the generation mechanism of neutrino masses is the same as that of charged lepton masses ( i.e. neutrinos are of dirac type ) . on the contrary , if the tiny neutrino masses are generated from the seesaw mechanism @xcite , kartavtsev s extension of the koide formula will be pointless due to the majorana mass term .",
    "the second is that the koide formula consists of the pole masses of fermions , which are the low energy quantities and are defined at different energy scales .",
    "this is extremely counterintuitive , since we always expect simple formulae at high energy scales , where some symmetries are restored .",
    "hence , the renormalization effects will not allow the koide - like formulae for both the pole and running fermion masses simultaneously .",
    "finally , we should point out that kartavtsev s extension of the koide formula @xcite and our corresponding detailed explorations are still at the phenomenological level .",
    "a similar work ( the most general extension of the koide formula ) , taking all the twelve fermions into account , i.e. @xmath68 , is also not quite successful .",
    "therefore , a possible direction for further extensions of the koide - like formulae is to seek the theoretical basis of these empirical relations , as koide originally did in a composite model or an extended technicolor - like model @xcite .",
    "we should incorporate in the extended koide formulae the elements and the mixing and phase angles in the lepton and quark mixing matrices @xcite , and maybe also the fermion charges",
    ". this will be the topic for our future research .",
