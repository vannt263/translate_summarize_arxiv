    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a fundamentally important factor for galaxy formation and evolution , because it can control the number evolution of stars with different masses in galaxies and thus the long - term evolution of luminosities , chemical abundances , dynamical properties of galaxies ( e.g. , larson 1998 ) .",
    "physical interpretation of observational data and theoretical predictions of galactic properties therefore depend strongly on what imf is adopted .",
    "it is still controversial , however , whether the imf is universal or different in galaxies with different physical properties ( e.g. , bastian et al .",
    "2010 ; kroupa et al .",
    "it is also observationally unclear whether or how the imf depends on local physical properties of star - forming giant molecular clouds in galaxies with different properties ( e.g. , masses and luminosities ) , though previous theoretical studies of star formation investigated possible dependences of the imf slopes on cloud properties ( e.g. , elmegreen 2004 ; larson 2005 ) .",
    "a growing number of recent observational studies have found possible evidences for ( i ) a significant variation of the imf in galaxies with different physical properties and different redshifts and ( ii ) correlations between the imf slope and galactic properties ( e.g. , hoversten & glazebrook 2008 ; van dokkum 2008 ; meurer et al .",
    "2009 , m09 ; treu et al . 2010",
    "; gunawardhana et al .",
    "2011 , g11 ; cappellari et al . 2012 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012 ; ferreras et al .",
    "2012 ; van dokkum & conroy 2012 ; geha et al .",
    "these observational results have raised a number of questions on the imf such as ( i ) how the imf can be bottom - heavy in the formation of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , van dokkum & conroy 2012 ) , ( ii ) how the imf slope depends on star formation rates and densities in galaxies ( e.g. , m09 ; g11 ) , and ( iii ) whether or not galaxy formation models with a universal imf ( uimf ) can explain the observed faber - jackson and tully - fisher relation of galaxies ( e.g. , dutton et al .",
    "2011 ) .    a number of previous theoretical studies adopted a non - standard imf to explain some specific observational results on physical properties of galaxies ( e.g. , elmegreen 2009 for a recent review ) .",
    "their models with top - heavy imfs tried to explain the observed colors of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , pipino & matteuci 2004 ) , the chemical abundances ( e.g. , [ @xmath4/fe ] ) of giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , nagashima et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the number counts of distant submillimeter galaxies ( baugh et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these studies chose a fixed non - standard imf either for the entire galaxy formation or only for starburst phases in an arbitrary manner in order to explain some specific observational results .",
    "these studies are therefore unable to discuss how the imf _ should _ change in different galaxies and in different environments in order to explain different observational results _ in a self - consistent manner .",
    "_    so far , only a few theoretical studies have investigated the time evolution of the imf in galaxies with different physical properties based on hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution with a nuimf model ( e.g. , dav 2008 ; narayana & dav 2012 ; bekki & meurer 2013 , bm13 ) .",
    "these simulations , however , did not consider the possible physical effects of a nuimf on galaxies thus were unable to discuss whether and how a nuimf can influence the formation and evolution processes of galaxies in a self - consistent manner .",
    "although the number of sne , chemical yields , and dust yields are significantly different between different imfs , previous numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution with a nuimf model did not include the dependences of sn feedback effects , chemical evolution , and dust production processes on the imf . therefore , it is essential for theoretical studies to include self - consistently the imf - dependent physical processes in order to discuss how galaxy evolution is influenced by a nuimf .",
    "thus the two major purposes of this paper are as follows .",
    "one is to describe the details of our new chemodynamical simulations with a nuimf model .",
    "the other is to show the preliminary results of the simulations on the major influences of the adopted nuimf on sfrs , chemical and dynamical evolution , and dust and @xmath1 contents of disk galaxies .",
    "we implement the nuimf model recently proposed by marks et al .",
    "( 2012 , m12 ) in the present study .",
    "this is mainly because the nuimf model by m12 was derived from comparison between observational data sets and theoretical modeling .",
    "m12 showed that ( i ) the stellar present - day mass function ( pdmf ) in the galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) can be determined by residual - gas expulsion at the epoch of gc formation , ( ii ) the gas expulsion process depends on the high - mass imf ( @xmath5 ) of forming gcs , and ( iii ) the observed pdmf depending on gc properties ( half - mass radius , mass density , and metallicity ) can be reproduced by their nuimf model that depends on density and metallicity of forming gcs .",
    "although the adopted nuimf model has some physical basis ( as above ) , we briefly discuss advantages and disadvantages of the present chemodynamical simulations with the nuimf model by m12 later in this paper .        the influences of the adopted nuimf in chemical evolution of gas - rich galaxies derived in the gas - rich mw models ( m2 and m3 ) can be seen even in gas - poor ( @xmath6 ) galaxies , if they experience starbursts triggered by galaxy interaction .",
    "a1 shows that double peaks can be seen in the [ mg / fe ] distribution only for the model with the nuimf .",
    "the peak around [ mg / fe]@xmath7 in the model with the nuimf is due to the secondary starburst triggered by tidal interaction .",
    "the influences of the nuimf on the final [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] distributions derived in the mw models can be clearly seen in the low - mass disk models .",
    "a2 clearly shows that the mean [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] can be higher in the gas - rich lmc model ( m5 ) . these higher [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] for the nuimf can be seen in other low - mass disk models of the present study .",
    "it is confirmed that the influences of the nuimf of the final [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] distributions and age - metallicity relations does not depend on the baryonic mass fractions of galaxies .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "a3 for the mw model with a smaller baryonic fraction ( m10 ) shows that ( i ) the final [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] are higher for the nuimf and ( ii ) [ mg / fe ] for a given [ fe / h ] is higher for [ fe / h]@xmath8 . these results imply that the nuimf is important for the very early chemical evolution of galactic disks .      in fig .",
    "a4 , the evolution rate of a physical quantity @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) is defined as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are time at the initial and final time step used for the @xmath13 estimation of a simulation , respectively .",
    "the mean evolution rate for each physical quantity is estimated by making an average for 15 models and the value is listed both for the uimf and the nuimf in table a1 . this table clearly shows how the evolution of @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath14 can be different between the uimf and the nuimf .    for @xmath3 and @xmath14",
    ", the evolution rates do not depend so strongly on @xmath12 ( e.g. , whether it is 1 gyr or 2gyr ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 gyr and @xmath16 gyr are chosen for @xmath3 and @xmath14 . owing to more violent changes of @xmath2 in the early evolution phases of gas disks , @xmath17 gyr rather than @xmath15 gyr",
    "can better estimate the evolution rate for @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 gyr and @xmath16 gyr are chosen for @xmath2 in most models .",
    "for the dwarf model ( m6 ) with the uimf and the nuimf , @xmath17 gyr and @xmath18 gyr , because the evolution rate of @xmath2 can be better estimated for such @xmath11 and @xmath12 owing to an intriguing behavior ( more violent changes with time ) in the later evolution of @xmath2 .",
    "the joint evolution of @xmath3 , @xmath14 , and @xmath2 in dwarf galaxies need to be more extensively investigated in a separate paper ."
