    "since high - redshift ( @xmath3 ) powerful radio galaxies ( hzprgs ) provide us a unique opportunity to investigate the formation and evolution of both galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , follow - up investigations have been made intensively for these past two decades ( chambers , miley , & van breugel 1990 ; eales & rawlings 1993 , 1996 ; rttgering et al .",

    "one of important problems related to hzprgs is the so - called `` alignment effect \" ; there is the strong correlation between the position angles of the radio axis and the rest - frame optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) continua for prgs at redshifts above @xmath4 0.6 ( chambers , miley , & van breugel 1987 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "1987 ; see also djorgovski et al .",
    "the origin of this alignment effect has been in debate ( e.g. , mccarthy 1993 ) and there are two favorable ideas .",
    "one is the jet - induced star formation in which the uv continuum emission is considered to arise from massive stars formed in the shocked region ( e.g. , chambers et al .",
    "1987 ; mccarthy et al . 1987 ; rees 1989 ; begelman & cioffi 1989 ; daly 1990 ) .",
    "the kinematics and ionization state of hzprgs often suggest the importance of the shock heating ( e.g. , best et al .",
    "2000 ; de breuck et al .",
    "an alternative idea is the scattering of an anisotropic continuum radiation from a central engine of agn ( tadhunter , fosbury , & di serego alighieri 1988 ; fabian 1988 ; di serego alighieri et al .",
    "1989 ; scarrott , rolph , & tadhunter 1990 ; cimatti et al .",
    "the strong linear polarization in the rest - frame uv continua has been considered as strong evidence for this idea ( e.g. , cimatti et al . 1998 and references therein ) .    among the hzprgs with evidence for the alignment effect",
    ", mrc 0406@xmath0244 has been investigated in detail ( mccarthy et al .",
    "1992 ; eales & rawlings 1993 , 1996 ; rush et al .",
    "this radio galaxy was discovered in the mrc/1jy radio source survey and identified as a hzprg at @xmath3 = 2.429 ( mccarthy et al .",
    "1991 , 1996 ) .",
    "it shows core and double - lobe structures in radio , and the rest - frame uv line and continuum emission are spatially extended along the radio axis , forming an elongated ` s ' or ` 8'-shaped structure with some knots ( rush et al .",

    "they found that the scattering by dust in tidal features , which could be made by a putative merger between galaxies , is favored to explain the optical depth of each knot .",
    "however , mccarthy ( 1999 ) suggested that the morphological appearance of the extended nebula around mrc 0406@xmath0244 seen in redshifted h@xmath5 and [ o iii ] lines looks like a pair of superbubbles ( see also pentericci et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is the galactic - scale outflow driven by the collective effect of a large number of supernova explosions of massive stars formed in a starburst ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ; tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; see for a review heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ) . in order to examine the possibility that the uv morphology may alternatively be interpreted as a pair of superbubbles",

    "observations were made with the focas ( faint object camera and spectrograph : kashikawa et al .",

    "the seeing condition was 0.7 arcsec . in order to observe both line and continuum emission properties of mrc 0406@xmath0244",
    ", we set the 0.8 arcsec wide slit along the major axis of the radio structure ( pa = 128@xmath10 ; e.g. , rush et al .",
    "the 300b grating together with a y47 filter allows us to obtain an optical spectrum between 4700    and 9000    with a spectroscopic resolution of 11.3    ( the instrumental full width at half maximum ) .",

    "although this galaxy exhibits strong ly@xmath14 emission line ( mccarthy et al .",

    "all these lines are clearly extended over 2   both in nw and se directions .",
    "the continuum emission is found within the nuclear @xmath15   region , although rush et al .",
    "( 1997 ) detected the extended continuum emission over @xmath16   on their high - resolution hst images .",
    "a spectrum of the red galaxy at nw of mrc 0406@xmath0244 is also recorded .",
    "however , its redshift is unknown since it does not have any strong emission lines in the observed wavelength coverage . in the left hand panels , we present the spatial variations of emission - line velocities ( top panel ) , full width at half maxima ( fwhm ) of the emission lines corrected for the instrumental resolution ( middle panel ) , and the emission - line ratios of c iv / he",
    "ii , c iii]/he ii , and c iv / c iii ] ( bottom panel ) . in all the panels ,",
    "the continuum peak at @xmath121640    is set to be the origin .",
    "the kinematical structure of the emission - line nebula is complicated across the region .",
    "the velocity difference between the nw and the se sides amounts to @xmath4 1500 km s@xmath7 for the velocity curve probed by the c iv emission .",
    "all emission lines are blue - shifted at most of off - nuclear regions ( @xmath17 ) comparing to the velocity around the nucleus .",
    "it is noted that the velocity curves do not show a simple symmetric structure around the nucleus .",
    "mccarthy et al . ( 1996 ) and pentericci et al . ( 2001 ) found another emission - line component with @xmath4 1000 km s@xmath7 with respect to the systemic velocity by ly@xmath14 emission .",
    "our observations show that this component can not be probed by the three emission lines studied here .",
    "the c iv velocity field is more blue - shifted with respect to that of both c iii ] and he ii at off - nuclear regions .",
    "the line widths of both c iv and c iii ] emission are as wide as @xmath18 km s@xmath7 in fwhm at off - nuclear regions , which is too broad to be explained by the thermal motion of star - forming nebulae within the disk .",
    "the nuclear region shows a narrower line width ( @xmath19 km s@xmath7 ) in c iv . on the other hand ,",
    "the line width of he ii shows the different trend , i.e. , fwhm of he ii is wider around the nucleus ( @xmath20 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "all these properties can not be interpreted by a typical galactic rotation of the host galaxy .",
    "it is noted that the different behavior of the c iv line from those of the other emission lines may be attributed to the large optical depth effect because the c iv emission line is a resonance line .",
    "the three emission - line ratios ( c iv / he ii , c iii]/he ii , and c iv / c iii ] ) are very useful to examine excitation mechanisms of the ionized gas ( photoionization by massive stars or agn , or shock - heating ) in high-@xmath3 objects1640 values in the shock+precursor models of allen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are underestimated by a factor of 1 - 6 ; see p. 530 of de breuck et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . ]",
    "( e.g. , allen , dopita , & tsvetanov 1998 ; de breuck et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we find that the relative intensity of c iv increases with increasing radial distance ( see panel c of figure 1 ) .",
    "this stronger c iv emission at large radial distance can not be understood in terms of photoionization by massive stars since the ionization potential of the line ( 64.5 ev ) is too high to be ionized by the ionizing radiation from massive stars . in order to understand the excitation mechanism more clearly , we present uv emission - line diagnostics in figure 2 ; a ) c iii]/he ii vs. c iv / c iii ] , b ) c",
    "iv / he ii vs. c iv / c iii ] , and c ) c iv / he ii vs. c iii]/he ii .",
    "the observed data points are shown together with model results of both agn photoionization ( sutherland , bicknell , & dopita 1993 ) and shock heating ( dopita & sutherland 1996 ) ; see , for the parameters adopted in the models , the upper right panel of figure 2 .    in all diagrams",
    ", we find that both the nuclear region and the inner regions within @xmath21 arcsec ( i.e. , @xmath22 kpc ) can be understood in terms of the agn photoionization with the ionization parameter from log @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ionization parameter increases with increasing radial distance .",
    "since the ionizing photon density should decrease with the @xmath25 law , it is necessary to invoke that the nucleon density could decrease as @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "an alternative idea may be that the shock heating is more dominated in the outer regions .",
    "in particular , the large departure from the prediction of agn photoionization can be seen in the outermost part of the se nebula .",
    "there seem to be two possible explanations for this departure .",
    "one is the metallicity effect because the strengths of both c iv and c iii emission lines become to be larger with decreasing carbon abundance ( e.g. , vernet et al .",
    "2001 ) . in order to explain the observed sudden change , it is necessary to assume that the carbon abundance decreases suddenly by a factor of 2.5 in the outer regions .",
    "this value seems not surprising because some hzprgs show evidence for such metal - poor ionized gas ( villar - martn et al .",
    "1997 ; de breuck et al .",
    "2000 ; overzier et al .",
    "2001 ; vernet et al . 2001 ) .",
    "another idea may be the shock heating .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the se emission - line component tends to favor the shock model with the shock velocity of @xmath28 200 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this inferred shock velocity appears consistent with the observed fwhm of the se nebula ; see panel ( b ) in figure 1 .",
    "although it seems hard to judge which is the case for the outer part of the se nebula of mrc 0406@xmath0244 , the shock heating may contribute in part to the ionization .",
    "our new optical spectroscopy has shown that the spatially extended nebulae seen in both the nw and se directions are mainly ionized by agn photoionization although the se nebula shows possible evidence for the shock heating .",
    "if we interpret that the se nebula contains metal - poor ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) gas photoionized by the agn nonthermal continuum , it is necessary to assume that the metallicity of the ionized gas shows the sudden change at @xmath30 20 kpc .",
    "this sudden change may be interpreted by an idea that gas clouds swept up by the superwind activity could interact with the ambient halo gas at this radius .",
    "if we regard that the figure-8 shaped morphology of the se and nw nebulae is attributed to wound tidal features ( rush et al 1997 ) , it seems hard to explain the sudden change in metallicity .",
    "it is therefore considered that the figure-8 shaped morphology can be interpreted as the relic of a pair of superbubbles .",
    "the origin of uv continuum of the figure-8 shaped structure is not clear .",
    "since the majority of the ionization can be attributed to the agn photoionization , massive stars could not be the major uv continuum source .",
    "stars later than b - type stars could contribute to the uv continuum if they were made in the shock heated gas clouds . an alternative idea is the scattering of an anisotropic continuum radiation from a central engine of agn ( e.g. , cimatti et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "however , no spectropolarimetry has not yet been done for mrc 0406@xmath0244 and thus we can not conclude which is the case",
    ". it will be important to carry out optical spectropolarimetry to investigate this issue in future .",
    "here we consider a possible origin of the alignment effect of mrc 0406@xmath0244 .",
    "we attribute the figure-8 shaped morphology of this galaxy to a pair of superbubbles .",
    "since mrc 0406@xmath0244 is associated with a bright host galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) , the host galaxy may be a typical massive galaxy with a mass of @xmath33 .",
    "if this is the case , it takes @xmath34 yr to the onset of the superbubble from the host galaxy potential ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) .",
    "this age appears consistent with that estimated by eales & rawlings ( 1993 ; see also mccarthy et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the age of the radio jet ( @xmath35 ) in mrc 0406@xmath0244 is much shorter than the above timescale because the projected distances of the nw and se radio lobes , 54.5 kpc and 29.5 kpc , gives nominally @xmath36 yr and @xmath37 yr , respectively , given the jet velocity of @xmath38 ( e.g. , alexander & leahy 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to consider that the radio jet activity is an independent phenomenon from the starburst and the subsequent superwind activity .",
    "this seems to make sense because the onset of the radio - jet activity needs the presence of a supermassive black hole and the gas accretion onto it ( e.g. , rees 1984 ) , both of which are different things from the starburst activity .",
    "here a question arises as why the radio jet axis is aligned to the superwind direction since the radio - jet activity and the starburst / superwind activity are different physical processes and their timescales are also significantly different .",
    "the superwind could blow as a bipolar wind , which is often observed in many superwind galaxies in the local universe ( see heckman et al .",
    "1990 ) , since it is likely that the gas in the host galaxy is distributed with a disk - like configuration even for the young host galaxy of mrc 0406@xmath0244 . on the other hand ,",
    "the radio jet is expelled to the two directions perpendicular to the accretion plasma disk .",
    "therefore , we can explain the alignment effect if the accretion disk is nearly co - planer to the host disk .",
    "another example to which this scenario is applicable may be b3 0731 + 438 at @xmath3 = 2.43 studied by motohara et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which also shows the alignment effect with the biconical nebula .",
    "mrc 0406@xmath0244 tells us that the intense starburst and subsequent superwind activity may be important even in hzprgs . in particular",
    ", the formation of shell - like structures driven by the superwind activity gives rise to some important implication .",
    "for example , if low - mass stars are also formed in blobs , the blobs could evolve either to globular clusters ( taniguchi , trentham , & ikeuchi 1999 ) or to dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , mori , yoshii , & nomoto 1999 ) .",
    "another example of such superwind / superbubble - driven formation of shell - like structures may be lrg j0239 - 0134 at @xmath39 ( taniguchi & murayama 2001 ) . since high - redshift superwinds could contribute to the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1990 ; taniguchi , & shioya 2001 ) , it will be important to investigate hzprgs systematically",
    ".    we would like to the staff of the subaru telescope office .",
