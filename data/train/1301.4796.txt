    "a variety of quantum error - correcting codes ( qeccs ) have been widely investigated aiming at a robust computing system similar to the classical digital computer  @xcite .",
    "in particular , codes based on the stabilizer formalism constitute an important class of qeccs . this formalism has proven useful not only for the standard codes  @xcite , but also for the subsystem code  @xcite , topological  @xcite , and majorana codes  @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "knill _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated its usefulness in the nmr domain  @xcite .",
    "stabilizer - based qeccs in systems with always - on coupling have recently attracted a great deal of interest  @xcite .",
    "stabilizer operators @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are mutually commuting operators given by products of multiple pauli matrices @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "conventionally , logical qubit states are encoded through measurements into a joint , @xmath7-dimensional , eigenspace @xmath8 of these operators . for @xmath9 stabilizer operators and @xmath10 physical qubits ,",
    "a maximum number of @xmath11 logical qubits can be encoded into @xmath8 , while @xmath12 in case of subsystem encoding . since the ground states of the stabilizer hamiltonian @xmath13 are joint eigenstates of all stabilizer operators , its ground - state manifold can play the role of @xmath8 .",
    "it is important to note that stabilizer operators of many error - correction codes , e.g. , the surface code  @xcite or color code  @xcite , are given by products of more than two pauli matrices .",
    "therefore the corresponding stabilizer hamiltonians can not be directly implemented in natural solid - state qubit systems , where the interactions between qubits are of two - body type  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate how to prepare ground states of @xmath14 as encoded states and preserve them by inducing the effective dynamics of this hamiltonian using sequences of pulses in the form of single - qubit rotations . being based on single - qubit rotations only , our method works for an always - on physical ( qubit ) hamiltonian with two - qubit interactions , i.e. , it does not require switching on and off any of its parts ( single - qubit or interaction ) . that local manipulation schemes are in general sufficient to induce arbitrary hamiltonian dynamics was shown by bennet _ et al . _",
    "benjamin and bose  @xcite proposed a particular implementation based on single - qubit rotations to perform quantum computations on a one - dimensional system of bare qubits with always - on heisenberg interactions .",
    "the distinguishing feature of our method is that it allows the preparation of qecc encoded states without measurements , thus avoiding measurement - induced decoherence .",
    "the method can be used not only for standard codes ( i.e. , five - qubit and css codes ) but also for the extended class of codes with encoding schemes within the general operator quantum error correction framework  @xcite . even in the presence of inevitable pulse ( rotation angle ) errors",
    "the ground - state fidelity scales favorably with the system size .",
    "our scheme provides an essential ingredient for the implementation of stable solid - state quantum memories .",
    "this , in turn , facilitates the realization of quantum gates  @xcite within the limitations imposed by the size and coherence time of a system .",
    "in fact , our approach even allows us to directly realize arbitrary single- and multiqubit gates on error - correcting codewords using only single - qubit rotations .",
    "although the scheme requires a rather large number of pulses ( rotations ) , its feasibility can be anticipated based on the recent progress in qubit - manipulation techniques  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction of the scheme to induce the dynamics of a stabilizer operator starting from a simple initial hamiltonian in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyngen ] , we explain the extraction of suitable initial hamiltonians and two - qubit gates from typical solid - state qubit hamiltonians using only single - qubit rotations in sec .  [",
    "sec : extractfromh ] .",
    "the whole procedure is applied to the examples of the five - qubit , steane , and kitaev s surface code in sec .",
    "[ sec : stdcodes ] , illustrating the versatility and generality of our method .",
    "this is followed by an illustration of how to use pulses both to prepare codewords without measurements and apply gate operations on logical qubits in sec .",
    "[ sec : prepandgate ] .",
    "a discussion of the robustness of the scheme against pulse errors is provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : rubustness ] .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we present our conclusions .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table ii shows how to generate the steane code .",
    "the stabilizer operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are obtained by @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the minimal total time is @xmath19 ns , i.e. , again much shorter than the @xmath20 given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the realization of kitaev s surface code ,",
    "we need to generate four types of stabilizer operators .",
    "qubits are placed at the edges of the square lattice ; see fig .",
    "stabilizer operators @xmath21 are assigned to each vertex @xmath22 , and @xmath23 to each face @xmath24 . using the relations @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ", we can form products of nearest - neighbor operators such as @xmath27 @xmath28 . in generating adjacent stabilizer operators",
    ", care should be taken to avoid mixing them .",
    "this can be achieved by decompositions like @xmath29 [ see figs .  [ topo](a ) and [ topo](b ) ] and @xmath30 [ figs .",
    "[ topo](c ) and [ topo](d ) ] .",
    "the four elements can then be combined into the total surface - code hamiltonian .",
    "lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite starting from a single - qubit hamiltonian that includes @xmath31 operators .",
    "all operators in ( a ) and ( b ) are transformed to @xmath32 and those in ( c ) and ( d ) to @xmath33 .",
    "subsequently , the four types of stabilizer operators are combined into the topological hamiltonian in the manner discussed in the text.,width=302 ]",
    "our approach also allows us to prepare encoded states ( or codewords ) of general stabilizer - based codes without performing measurements on the system and to implement arbitrary single- and multiqubit gate operations .",
    "we show this in detail for the standard codes , which encode @xmath34 logical qubits into a subspace of dimension @xmath35 .",
    "however , this procedure also works for subsystem encoding provided suitable stabilizer operators are added . for any given code ,",
    "only those @xmath1 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 that contain @xmath32 or @xmath31 operators are needed for the preparation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and operators @xmath40 act in the logical state space @xmath41 , @xmath42 . here , @xmath43 denotes a modified stabilizer operator obtained from @xmath1 by replacing the @xmath32 operator acting on qubit @xmath44 by a @xmath31 operator , or vice versa .",
    "this is done in order to match the effect of an _ individual _ factor @xmath45 $ ] with the action of the projector @xmath46 when qubit @xmath44 is in state @xmath47 . to fulfill eq .   for all @xmath36 _ simultaneously _ , all the @xmath48 have to be different and the modified stabilizers have to be generated in an order such that prior to @xmath43 none of the @xmath49 with @xmath50 have acted on qubit @xmath48 with an @xmath32 or @xmath31 .    by implementing the second row of eq .",
    ", the quantum information is encoded into the logical qubit _",
    "after _ the basis state @xmath51 is generated by applying appropriate logical gate operations ( see below ) .",
    "it is also possible , however , to start from an arbitrary ( potentially unknown ) qubit state that is encoded into a @xmath35-dimensional subspace of physical qubits @xmath52 for all @xmath53 with @xmath54 . for @xmath55",
    "this subspace has to be a simultaneous eigenspace of the stabilizer operators @xmath56 , which contain only @xmath33 operators [ as the @xmath57 stabilizer operators that involve @xmath32 and @xmath31 are used for state preparation , in accordance with eq .  ] .",
    "this second approach is particularly useful for codes with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , like the five - qubit code . in that case , for any choice of qubits @xmath48 the generation of the @xmath43 alone directly encodes the state of the single physical qubit @xmath60 into the ground - state manifold of the stabilizer hamiltonian .",
    "we illustrate the encoding procedure on the example of a three - qubit code whose stabilizer operators are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this is realized in a three - qubit system with ising interactions .",
    "the stabilizer hamiltonian @xmath63 is obtained by removing the single - qubit part @xmath64 of the original hamiltonian using @xmath65 pulses .",
    "its ground states can be written as @xmath66 .",
    "thus , an arbitrary logical single qubit state @xmath67 can be obtained via @xmath68\\exp[i(\\pi/4)x_1y_2]|\\alpha 00 \\rangle$ ] .",
    "note that since the choice of modified stabilizers is not unique , we could just as well start from a state with the information initially encoded in qubit 2 or 3 .",
    "for the five - qubit code , we can choose @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where the multiplication in eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) is carried out in the following order : @xmath73 $ ] @xmath74 $ ] @xmath75 $ ] @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "this choice of modified stabilizers encodes the state of qubit 4 into the corresponding codeword state . in the case of the steane code , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "note that here only three out of six stabilizer operators are needed for the preparation of an encoded state .",
    "gate operations on logical states , like rotations , phase gates , etc .",
    ", can be realized by dynamically generating the generators of the gates for an appropriate time . for example , the pauli operator @xmath80 for the five - qubit code is given by @xmath81 .",
    "hence , by dynamically generating the average hamiltonian @xmath82 within a time @xmath83 , we can perform a rotation through angle @xmath84 about the @xmath85 axis on state @xmath86 . for two five - qubit codes implemented on physical qubits",
    "1 to 10 , the two - qubit controlled phase gate is applied by generating @xmath87 within a time @xmath88 .",
    "the generalization to arbitrary gate operations and codes is straightforward .",
    "since the codeword states are encoded in the twofold - degenerate ground - state manifold @xmath89 and @xmath90 of @xmath14 , the robustness of this method is limited by the rate of leakage out of this manifold . in principle , precise estimates of the leakage due to the thermal environment could be obtained by studying the stability of the ground state to various perturbations as in ref .",
    "however , energy nonconserving single - qubit errors  often a prevalent kind of error created by a thermal bath  are exponentially suppressed for temperatures that are small compared to the zeeman - splitting @xmath91 .",
    "hence , besides local imperfections and noise sources , unavoidable pulse errors are likely to be the predominant cause of leakage , at low temperatures .    to estimate this effect , we consider pulse errors that can be modeled by randomly distributed , unbiased , and uncorrelated deviations @xmath92 with @xmath93 from the ideal angle of @xmath94 .",
    "the leakage can then be estimated by looking at the average of the ground - state fidelity @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the time evolution operator with imperfect pulses .",
    "this average is approximately given by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the number of pulses in the sequence to generate @xmath14 , and @xmath99 is its duration .",
    "the number @xmath98 of pulses is given by the number of rotations needed to generate all stabilizers of a given code ( for the five - qubit and steane code , see tables  [ tab:5qb ] and [ tab : css ] , respectively ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated measurement - free preparation of encoded states in the stabilizer - based codes described by the operator quantum error correction paradigm .",
    "the scheme is based on pulse sequences applied to solid - state qubit hamiltonians with two - body interactions of @xmath0 or ising type .",
    "we have estimated the intrinsic robustness of our scheme against pulse imperfections .",
    "depending on the required operation time needed for scalable quantum computations using a particular ( solid - state ) qubit implementation , this allows us to determine an upper limit for the magnitude of pulse errors .",
    "in addition to being the first step of realizing a large class of stabilizer codes in solid - state systems at all , the dynamic generation of qecc hamiltonian dynamics also provides protection against certain classes of local errors such as impurities .",
    "further steps towards a stable quantum memory would require to protect the code against thermal fluctuations , which could be achieved , e.g. , by a coupling to appropriate , nonlocal external fields  @xcite .",
    "once implemented experimentally , our scheme will therefore pave the way for robust quantum information processing .",
