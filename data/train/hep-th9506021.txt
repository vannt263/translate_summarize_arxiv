    "there are many reasons for detailed studies of dynamics of vortices .",
    "let us mention here the cosmic string hypothesis @xcite , condensed matter physics @xcite , qcd flux  tube @xcite and a search for a physical model of a relativistic string @xcite .",
    "cumulative efforts by various groups of physicists have unravelled many aspects of fascinating dynamics of vortices .",
    "vortex is a quite complex object  due to its macroscopic thread - like extension it has nontrivial time - evolution with occasional self - interactions of various kinds like scattering @xcite or interconnection @xcite .",
    "moreover , because of its finite transverse size it can also act as effective potential well trapping various fields .",
    "the first example of this kind was the superconducting string @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this can happen also in the more restrictive framework of abelian higgs model @xcite . here",
    "the trapped fields are just some components of the vector field . because other components of the same vector field form the vortex itself , it is natural to regard this phenomenon as the excitation of the vortex .",
    "this aspect of dynamics of the vortex becomes important when the vortex is subjected to such violent transitions like the interconnection or hard scattering on an external potential .",
    "in fact , numerical investigations of the interconnection clearly show that after this process the involved parts of vortices are excited , @xcite .",
    "the vortex can also become excited by interaction with particles scattered on it .",
    "excitations of the vortex in the abelian higgs model were studied recently in the paper @xcite . in that paper an effective membrane description of the vortex was proposed .",
    "the membrane was identified with the surface on which the energy density is maximal - for a straight - linear , static vortex with winding number @xmath4 it is a cylinder of finite radius . in the membrane model there",
    "exists solution which describes a symmetric bulb travelling along the straight - linear cylinder .",
    "it corresponds to a local excitation of the vortex .",
    "the shortcoming of such effective model is that it does not yield information on detailed form of the excited vortex fields .",
    "comprehensive numerical study of various excitations of local and global vortices has been carried out by the authors of ref.@xcite .",
    "the excitation we consider in the present paper has not been investigated there .    in general ,",
    "excitations of the vortex can be divided into two classes , according to the involved components of fields . in the first class",
    "there are excitations which do not involve new components of the gauge or higgs fields  only modes of those components which form the vortex itself are excited . for the vortex",
    "these are the modulus of the higgs field and the @xmath5 component of the vector field ( @xmath6 denotes the azimuthal angle ) .",
    "the other class of excitations requires to extend the vortex ansatz by allowing for non - trivial values of additional components of the higgs or the vector fields , i.e. the phase of the higgs field or the @xmath7 component of the vector field ( the @xmath8 component is equivalent to the phase by a gauge transformation ) .",
    "these latter excitations should rather be regarded as bound states of the additional fields with the vortex .",
    "the excitations are usually investigated in a linear approximation ",
    "they are treated as small corrections to the basic vortex fields .",
    "the excitation we are interested in belongs to the second class  it involves the @xmath7 component .",
    "it can be regarded as a bound state of longitudinal component of the vector field with the vortex . in the paper",
    "@xcite the existence of the excitation has been proved , and it has been shown that it can be represented by a 2-dimensional proca field which can propagate along the vortex .",
    "these results have been obtained in a linear approximation with respect to deviations of the fields from the static vortex solution .",
    "merely a rough description of the excitation was given ",
    "the main obstacle was the lack of analytic expression for the vortex solution even in the bogomolnyi limit @xcite .",
    "many interesting questions were left without answer , e.g. , what are properties of the excitation beyond the linear approximation .",
    "the excitation seems to exist for all values of the parameters of the abelian higgs model compatible with the existence of the stable vortex of topological charge + 1 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the present paper we concentrate mainly on the case of very small @xmath9 where it is possible to give explicit and relatively simple analytic formulae . here",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the masses of the vector and higgs particles , respectively .",
    "we would like to present a detailed study of the excitation in the case @xmath13 .",
    "our considerations are based on approximate , analytic expression for the vortex functions obtained in ( appropriately adapted ) so called polynomial approximation , used till now for domain walls @xcite .",
    "next , we obtain formulae for the profile and energy of the excitation .",
    "this in turn makes it possible to calculate back - reaction of the excitation on the vortex .",
    "the back - reaction is calculated in the case of very small @xmath0 when certain simplifications occur .",
    "we find that in the presence of the excitation the vortex has oscillating radius , and we calculate the frequency and amplitude of these oscillations .",
    "we also notice that there seems to exist an upper bound on amplitude of the excitation .",
    "such a bound reflects the non  linear character of the vortex dynamics and it could not be found in the linear approximation .",
    "however , the most striking result is that the excited vortex field has a long range component which is interpreted as radiation of the vector field .",
    "also this phenomenon is absent in the linear approximation .",
    "the general conclusion of our paper is that the effects of the back - reaction are very important  they qualitatively change the picture of the excited vortex obtained in the linear approximation .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in the next section we present the polynomial approximation for the vortex . in section 3 the profile and energy of the excitation",
    "are calculated .",
    "in section 4 we investigate the back - reaction of the excitation on the vortex .",
    "in section 5 we have collected several remarks about the method used in our paper and about the obtained results .",
    "we consider euler  lagrange equations of the abelian higgs model : @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 the mass of the higgs particle is equal to @xmath17 while for the vector field @xmath18 where @xmath19 signature of the space - time metric is ( + 1,-1,-1,-1 ) .    the solution of eqs .",
    "( 1),(2 ) , representing an infinite , straight - linear , topological charge + 1 vortex lying along the @xmath20axis , is sought with the help of the axially symmetric ansatz @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the radius in the @xmath25 plane and @xmath26 is the azimuthal angle . the functions @xmath27 obey the following boundary conditions : @xmath28 @xmath29 from ( 1 - 5 ) we obtain equations for @xmath30 and for @xmath31 :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denotes @xmath35 boundary conditions for @xmath36 have the form @xmath37 the magnetic field of the vortex is @xmath38 where @xmath39    the main idea of the polynomial approximation is to approximate the fields inside the axially symmetric vortex by simple polynomials in @xmath40 and to match the polynomials smoothly with asymptotic form of the vortex fields found for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the matching point .",
    "we shall call @xmath42 the matching radius of the vortex .",
    "accuracy of such approximation in general increases with the order of the polynomials . in the present section",
    "we shall assume a third order polynomial for @xmath30 and a sixth order polynomial for @xmath43 inserting these polynomials in eqs .",
    "( 8),(9 ) we find that the polynomial for @xmath30 contains only odd powers of @xmath44 , and the polynomial for @xmath36 only even ones .",
    "thus , denoting these polynomials by underlined letters , we have @xmath45    the order of the polynomial @xmath46 is the maximal one compatible with the assumed third order for the polynomial @xmath47  in order to compute the term @xmath48 in @xmath46 we would have to know the function @xmath30 in eq . ( 9 ) up to @xmath49 equations ( 8) , ( 9 ) give the following recurrence relations for the coefficients of the polynomials @xmath50    the asymptotic values @xmath51 of the fields @xmath52 outside of the vortex , i.e. for @xmath53 , where @xmath42 will be determined later on , we find using eqs.(8),(9 ) and the boundary conditions ( 7),(10 ) . there is a complication due to the fact that the asymptotics of the higgs field depends on @xmath0 @xcite . for @xmath54",
    "it is governed by the @xmath55 term in eq.(8 ) , while for @xmath56 it is governed by the higgs field mass term . in the following",
    "we shall assume that @xmath13 .",
    "this is mainly to limit the body of our paper  our methods of calculations of the properties of the excitation can be applied for any @xmath0 .",
    "an additional reason is that for small @xmath57 certain simplifications are possible , e.g. , one can use a kind of adiabatic approximation .    if for the higgs field we take @xmath58 then in the asymptotic region eq.(9 ) is effectively simplified to @xmath59 and its vanishing for large @xmath44 solution is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the modified hankel function @xcite and @xmath62 is a constant ( to be determined later on ) . in the next step",
    ", one could insert the asymptotics ( 16 ) for @xmath36 into eq.(8 ) and to determine corrections to the leading asymptotics ( 15 ) .",
    "iterating these steps and taking higher order polynomials for @xmath47 and @xmath63 we can obtain a very accurate description of the vortex which will be presented in a separate paper @xcite . in the present paper , devoted to the excitation rather than to the vortex",
    ", we will be satisfied with rather crude description of the unexcited vortex .",
    "the last step in obtaining the static vortex solution is to match the asymptotics with the polynomials ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) .",
    "we know from @xcite that for the exact static vortex solution @xmath30 is real analytic in @xmath64 as for the magnetic field , it is also true at least in the bogomolnyi limit .",
    "for this reason , the number of the matching relations depends only on the number of arbitrary constants present in the asymptotic solutions and in the polynomials - we just require maximal possible smoothness of the fields within the adopted ansatz ( 12,13,15,16 ) . in the present paper we will approximate @xmath30 and @xmath36 by functions of @xmath44 of the @xmath65 class at @xmath66 , and real analytic for @xmath67 .",
    "more accurate and smoother approximations to the vortex fields will be presented in @xcite .",
    "thus , we choose the following matching conditions for @xmath30 and @xmath36 : @xmath68 @xmath69 here @xmath70 with @xmath71 the radius @xmath42 and the coefficients @xmath72 are to be determined from ( 17),(18 ) .",
    "conditions ( 17 ) with ( 15 ) taken into acount give @xmath73 i.e. @xmath74 next , we calculate @xmath75 and @xmath76 from formulae ( 14 )  in this way we find @xmath77    the final step is to obey the matching conditions ( 18 ) for @xmath43 taking @xmath78 we find that they are equivalent to the following two equations from which we can determine @xmath62 and @xmath42 @xmath79 equation ( 23 ) can be easily solved for @xmath42 by numerical methods for any given @xmath80 for very small @xmath0 one can also give analytic formula : @xmath81 ( we have used the formula @xmath82 for @xmath83 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath84 the higgs radius of the vortex reaches the fixed value @xmath85 .",
    "comparison with numerical solutions of eq.(23 ) shows that formula ( 24 ) gives slightly too big value of @xmath42 , and that the error is only 6% even for @xmath86 . for @xmath87",
    "the error is 1% and it decreases rapidly for smaller @xmath0 . in general , the radius decreases with increasing @xmath0 , see fig.1 .",
    "@xmath88     fig.1 .",
    "@xmath42 as a function of @xmath0 , determined from eq.(23 ) .",
    "0.5 cm    the constant @xmath62 is found from eq(22 ) . in particular , for @xmath89 @xmath90    the magnetic field is given on outside of the vortex by formula ( 11 ) with @xmath91 ( formula ( 16 ) .",
    "it has indefinitely increasing range in the limit @xmath92 . at the same time",
    "its magnitude decreases so that its integral gives the unit of the magnetic flux .",
    "let us remark that for @xmath54 a more accurate approximation for the asymptotic field @xmath30 is provided by the formula @xmath93 using this asymptotics instead of @xmath94 in the matching conditions ( 17),(18 ) and a fifth order polynomial for @xmath47 we find that for @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the improved asymptotics gives slightly smaller matching radius .",
    "such more accurate asymptotics @xmath97 and a fifth order polynomial @xmath47 are used in section 4 .",
    "yet more accurate asymptotics is given by the formula @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a constant .",
    "this asymptotics is considered in @xcite .",
    "the approximate , analytic form of the vortex functions @xmath100 we have obtained in this section for @xmath54 will be used to study the excitation in more detail than it was done in @xcite .",
    "the excitation is another vortex  like solution of eqs . (",
    "it belongs to the same topological class as the vortex itself .",
    "arguments for existence of such a solution , based on a linear approximation , are given in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this solution is time - dependent .",
    "the ansatz ( 3 - 5 ) is now extended by including @xmath101 , while @xmath102 again .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath36 functions are now time  dependent . in this case",
    "equations ( 1),(2 ) reduce to the following set of equations @xmath103 where @xmath104 and the dots denote @xmath105 notice that there is no direct coupling of the @xmath106 field to the @xmath36 field , and that @xmath106 influences @xmath30 only by the single term @xmath107 in eq.(26 ) .",
    "we shall seek for the solutions of this set of equations using an iterative procedure .",
    "first , in the present section we aproximately solve eq.(28 ) assuming that the fields @xmath30 and @xmath36 form a background not influenced by the @xmath106 field , i.e. that they are equal to the initial vortex fields discussed in the previous section . with the back - reaction of the @xmath106 field on the vortex switched off , equation ( 28 )",
    "becomes linear equation for @xmath106 with explicitely given function @xmath108  hence the name `` linear approximation '' .",
    "the back - reaction of the @xmath106 field on the @xmath30 and @xmath36 fields we shall calculate in the next section .",
    "we hope that if we continued the iterations we would obtain a sequence of approximations convergent towards the exact solution at least for sufficiently small @xmath109 ( which is a dimensionless quantity ) .",
    "thus , in the present section we will find the bound - state type solution of the equation @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the higgs field of the unexcited vortex , calculated in the previous section .",
    "we shall use the crude asymptotics ( 15 ) and the third order polynomial ( 12 ) for the higgs field ",
    "it is sufficient in order to find the excitation and its basic characteristics .",
    "more accurate form of the higgs field would require significantly longer calculations and we think that the improvement would yield merely more accurate numbers , with no change in the overall picture of the excited vortex . if @xmath112 , the functions @xmath52 and @xmath106 are again approximated by polynomials @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively",
    ". for @xmath47 and @xmath46 we have formulae ( 12,13 ) , and @xmath115 we have noted that the coefficients in @xmath116 can be time  dependent .",
    "inserting formula ( 30 ) in eq.(28 ) we obtain the following set of equations @xmath117    if @xmath118 , in eq.(29 ) we put @xmath119 .",
    "it follows that @xmath120 where @xmath121 here @xmath122 is a constant , @xmath123 is the modified hankel function and @xmath124    the frequency @xmath125 and the constant @xmath62 are determined from matching conditions at @xmath126 @xmath127 we assume that the coefficients @xmath128 have the same time  dependence as @xmath129 i.e. @xmath130 with constant @xmath131 .",

    "we can determine only the ratio @xmath140 so the amplitude @xmath141 remains arbitrary in accordance with linearity of eq.(29 ) with the fixed @xmath142    equation ( 41 ) gives @xmath125 as a function of @xmath80 in general , one has to use numerical methods to find this function .",

    "@xmath143    fig.2 .",
    "@xmath125 as the function of @xmath0 , determined from eqs.(41),(35 )    .",
    "if @xmath144 , one can use formula ( 24 ) and the following asymptotic formula for the modified hankel function @xcite for @xmath83 @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the euler constant .",
    "formula ( 35 ) implies that for @xmath147 and @xmath148 vanish . keeping only the leading terms on both sides of eq.(41 )",
    "we obtain the equation @xmath149 which gives @xmath150 it is easy to see that the value of the coefficient in front of this formula for @xmath148 depends on subleading terms in eq.(41 ) . taking these terms into account",
    "we find that for @xmath144 @xmath151 where @xmath42 is given by formula ( 24 ) .",
    "comparison with numerical solutions of eq.(41 ) shows that formula ( 42 ) gives slightly too big value of @xmath148 , with 13% accuracy even for @xmath152 . for @xmath153",
    "the error is 2% and it decreases rapidly for smaller @xmath0 .    from eq.(40 ) we find that for small @xmath0 @xmath154 it follows that when @xmath92 , the function @xmath155 for any finite fixed @xmath44 tends to a constant value equal to @xmath141 , hence @xmath156 .",
    "the existence of the excitation in the linear approximation can be seen by regarding the equation @xmath157 obtained from eq .",
    "( 29 ) by substituting @xmath158 as schrdinger equation for a particle in the 2dimensional potential well given by @xmath159 it is a",
    "well known fact @xcite that any potential well on a plane has at least one bound state , hence localized non  zero solution @xmath106 of eq.(29 ) . for small @xmath0",
    "the potential well has finite width @xmath160 and it is very shallow ( @xmath161 nevertheless , the bound state exists and the corresponding frequency @xmath162 is given by formula ( 42 ) .",
    "estimate made in @xcite shows that the potential well is too weak to support p - wave bound states .",
    "therefore , we do not consider more general , @xmath6-angle dependent @xmath106 field .",
    "mathematically , the presence of the excitation changes the vortex because of the @xmath163 term in eq.(26 ) . because @xmath164,$ ] the perturbation has two components : the static one and the one oscillating with the frequency @xmath165 in order to calculate their influence on the vortex we reanalyse eqs.(26),(27 ) assuming that @xmath106 is given by the approximate solution of eq.(28 ) found in the previous section .",
    "we shall consider the limiting case @xmath89 when we can do this analytically .    in the case of very small @xmath0",
    ", @xmath163 changes in time very slowly as the frequency @xmath166 is very small . because we expect that the induced by the presence of the excitation time dependence of @xmath30 is also characterized by the frequency @xmath167 the term @xmath168 on the r.h.s of eq.(26 ) is of the order @xmath169 and it can be neglected .",
    "therefore , equation ( 26 ) approximately reduces to the following equation @xmath170    now let us turn to the eq.(27 ) for the field @xmath36 .",
    "again , we expect that the induced time dependence of @xmath36 is characterized by the frequency @xmath171 , so that the term @xmath172 is of the order @xmath173 .",
    "however , if we neglect this term then we also have to neglect the term @xmath174 , and eq.(27 ) reduces to the following equation @xmath175 its general solution has the form @xmath176 where @xmath177 are arbitrary constants .",
    "it is easy to see that such @xmath36 can not obey the boundary conditions ( 10 ) .",
    "thus , neglecting the terms @xmath178 in eq.(27 ) altogether is an oversimplification if we consider the whole range of @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath179 . on the other hand , it is acceptable approximation if we consider @xmath36 in a finite interval of the @xmath44 variable , e.g. , in a vicinity of the matching point , now denoted by @xmath180 .",
    "it breaks down only if we try to apply it also for @xmath181 .",
    "this means that the limits @xmath182 and @xmath183 are not interchangeable , and the correct order of them is that first we should find @xmath36 for very large @xmath44 and only after that we can consider the limit @xmath182 .",
    "one could see this by analysing the vortex solution of section 2 , cf .",
    "formulae ( 16),(25 ) . later on in this section",
    "we shall find the asymptotics @xmath184 for the very large @xmath44 .",
    "for the current calculations it is sufficient to know that for @xmath185 @xmath36 is given by formula ( 46 ) .    from eq.(44 ) we obtain approximate form of the higgs field @xmath30 in the presence of the excitation . as always in the polynomial approximation",
    "we separately consider the regions of small and large @xmath44 .",
    "the matching takes place at @xmath186 . in the region",
    "@xmath187 we will approximate @xmath30 by a fifth order polynomial , @xmath188 the reason is that the more precise ( from that considered in section 2 ) form of the asymptotics of the higgs field which is given below requires at least the fifth order polynomial if the matching conditions ( 17 ) are to be satisfied .",
    "instead of the first of recurrence relations ( 14 ) we now have @xmath189 we also obtain the relation @xmath190 notice that passing to the fifth order polynomial does not increase the number of arbitrary constants in our ansatz , because the new constant @xmath191 is related to the other constants by formula ( 49 ) .    for @xmath36 inside the vortex",
    "we again use the polynomial ( 13 ) , and now the coefficients @xmath192 can in principle depend on time .",
    "however , the corresponding recurrence relations in the limit @xmath92 reduce to @xmath193 the matching conditions ( 18 ) applied to the polynomial @xmath63 and @xmath194 given by formula ( 46 ) imply that @xmath195    the asymptotics @xmath97 of the higgs field obeys the following equation @xmath196 where @xmath197 is given by formula ( 34 ) , and @xmath184 is found below .",
    "we use the observation following from formulae ( 34),(43 ) that for any @xmath198 in the limit @xmath92 @xmath199 hence , @xmath200 changes very slowly with @xmath44 for small @xmath0 . as we shall see below , the same is true for @xmath184 , essentially because the mass of this field is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "then , it is easy to check that the equation for @xmath97 has the following approximate solution @xmath201 adopting this solution is equivalent to neglecting the derivative terms ( @xmath202 ) in eq.(52 ) .    the next step is to obey the matching conditions ( 17 ) .",
    "because the matching takes place at finite @xmath186 we may use formula ( 46 ) .",
    "we also use formulae ( 50),(51 ) , and we notice that for finite @xmath44 and @xmath92 @xmath203 as follows from formulae ( 34),(42),(43 ) . the matching conditions ( 17 ) give the following relation @xmath204 where @xmath205 as well as the equation @xmath206 for @xmath207 equation ( 55 ) has the following solution @xmath208 where the constant @xmath209 can be easily determined by numerical methods , @xmath210 moreover , we shall show later on that @xmath211 .",
    "@xmath212    it is clear from this formula and from the formula @xmath213 that @xmath180 oscillates in the interval @xmath214.$ ] let us recall that 2.11 is the matching radius in the absence of the excitation , as mentioned at the end of section 2 .",
    "we see from formula ( 56 ) that as @xmath215 approaches @xmath216 the amplitude of oscillations of @xmath180 increases indefinitely , and for still higher amplitude of the excitation formula ( 56 ) gives unphysical @xmath180 .",
    "we interpret this result as a hint that there is an upper bound @xmath217 on the amplitude @xmath141 of the excitation .",
    "such a bound would reflect nonlinear character of the set ( 26 - 28 )  in the linear approximation no restriction on the amplitude appears .",
    "it would be desirable to check the existence of the bound by another method , e.g. , by direct numerical analysis of eqs.(26 - 28 ) .",
    "interesting question what happens to the vortex if the bound is exceeded we will leave for a separate investigation .    in order to find the @xmath184 field of the excited vortex for the very large @xmath44 we have to solve equation ( 27 ) with @xmath218 , where @xmath97 is given by formula ( 53 ) . as discussed earlier",
    ", now we should not neglect the terms proportional to @xmath173 . inserting formula ( 53 ) and neglecting the term @xmath219 ( because we expect that @xmath184 is small for @xmath220 in comparison with the other terms  subsequent computation confirms this expectation ) we obtain the following equation @xmath221 where we have introduced the notation @xmath222 next , we split @xmath184 into a static and time - dependent parts , @xmath223 where the static part by definition obeys the equation @xmath224 it follows from formula ( 59 ) and eqs.(57),(60 ) that @xmath225 obeys the equation @xmath226 thus , @xmath227 acts as a source for @xmath225 .    in the present paper",
    "we will discuss only a perturbative solution of eq.(61 ) , obtained by expanding @xmath225 in powers of the dimensionless amplitude @xmath228 of the excitation .",
    "this solution is expected to be a good approximation to the exact solution of eq.(61 ) if the dimensionless amplitude is small , so from now on we assume that this is the case .",
    "the perturbative solution is sufficient to show that the excited vortex radiates the @xmath36 field .",
    "we start from the observation that the r.h.s . of eq.(61 ) together with formula ( 43 ) suggest that @xmath225 is of the order @xmath229 .",
    "therefore , the last term on the l.h.s . of eq.(61 ) is of the order @xmath230 and can be neglected if the dimensionless amplitude of the excitation is small . for the same reason , @xmath231 in eq.(61 ) can be replaced by @xmath0 . solving obtained in this way the simplified version of eq.(61 )",
    "we find the lowest order contribution to the perturbative series for @xmath225 .",
    "let us introduce a new function @xmath232 @xmath233 the simplified form of eq.(61 ) is equivalent to the following equation for the function @xmath234 : @xmath235 where @xmath236 observe that for the very small @xmath0 the coefficient @xmath237 is positive because then @xmath169 , see formulae ( 35),(42 ) .",
    "the asymptotics @xmath184 is determined by @xmath227 and @xmath234 .",

    "general , vanishing at the infinity solution of eq.(63 ) is given by the formula @xmath240 where @xmath241 are constants to be determined later on ; @xmath242 are bessel and von neumann functions , respectively @xcite ; and @xmath243 ( with @xmath244 ) is a particular solution of the inhomogeneous bessel equation @xmath245 for small @xmath0 we can approximate @xmath246 equation ( 66 ) can be solved by a standard method @xcite , @xmath247 where @xmath248 and @xmath249    the constants @xmath250 can be fixed by matching the asymptotics @xmath184 with @xmath194 , given by formulae ( 46),(51 ) , at @xmath186 .",
    "this requirement gives the following equations @xmath251",
    "@xmath252    \\cos(2\\omega_0 t + 2 \\delta ) =   - h_2 r_e.\\ ] ] next , we notice that for small @xmath0 ( when @xmath253 ) @xmath254 @xmath255 then it is easy to see that conditions ( 70),(71 ) imply that @xmath256 the definition ( 69 ) gives for @xmath257 @xmath258    the constant @xmath259 is not fixed by the matching conditions .",
    "the corresponding term in @xmath184 has the following form @xmath260 this function , as well as its derivatives , is regular for all @xmath44 including @xmath261 , and it obeys the wave equation @xmath262 in the whole space .",
    "therefore , we shall regard @xmath263 merely as an artifact of the linearity of eq.(57 ) , and interpret @xmath263 as a free , standing electromagnetic wave which is not related to the excited vortex . because we are interested in the excited vortex alone , we put @xmath264    thus , we have finally obtained that @xmath265    the function @xmath243 vanishes exponentially for large @xmath266 , but von neumann function @xmath267 decreases rather slowly for large @xmath266 , @xmath268 thus , the @xmath184 field has the long range component equal to @xmath269 its natural interpretation is that it describes radiation of the vector field from the excited vortex .",
    "it is easy to check that the resulting total field configuration has infinite energy per unit length of the vortex .",
    "this is due to the fact that we have considered the excitation of the standing wave type for the straight - linear , infinite vortex in infinite space .",
    "the presence of the long range radiative component means that the excited vortex should not be regarded as a localised soliton , eventhough it has the topological charge + 1 .",
    "let us recapitulate results of our paper .",
    "first , on a methodological side , we have shown that with the help of the polynomial approximation one can obtain analytic description of the excited vortex , including the profile and frequency of the excitation as well as the back - reaction of the excitation on the vortex .",
    "thus , the polynomial approximation turns out to be a useful tool also for investigations of dynamics of vortices  earlier it has been applied to domain walls @xcite .",
    "second , on a physics side , we have shown that the excited vortex contains the radiative component . to find it",
    ", one has to calculate the back - reaction of the excitation on the vortex .",
    "the back - reaction is due to non - linearity of eqs.(26 - 28 ) . in the linear approximation considered in section 3 the effects which are due to the back - reaction",
    "are not taken into account .",
    "the radiative component we have found is formed of the vector field .",
    "we expect that after several iterations of our procedure , i.e. correcting the vortex fields , then calculating corrections to the excitation field @xmath106 , next again correcting the vortex fields , etc .",
    ", one would also obtain a radiative component in the higgs field .",
    "its amplitude will be proportional to a higher power of the square of the dimensionless amplitude @xmath229 of the excitation .",
    "taking the back - reaction into account has resulted in drastic alteration of physical characteristics of the excited vortex obtained in the linear approximation .    in the present paper",
    "we have considered for simplicity only the standing wave type , @xmath20-independent solutions in the infinite space , and we have found that in this case the excitation has infinite energy because of the radiative component .",
    "nevertheless , the obtained solution might be of physical interest .",
    "for example , in a real system like a superconductor of finite volume one could sustain the excitation by an external electromagnetic wave and the standing wave regime could be obtained in the whole volume of the superconductor .",
    "it is clear that obtaining the standing wave in the infinite volume would require infinite energy .    for description of the excitation created dynamically during , e.g. , vortex reconnections , the standing wave , @xmath20-independent solution has to be modified .",
    "in such an event the excitation is created almost suddenly at certain instant of time with a finite amount of energy and it occupies only a small part of the vortex .",
    "it turns out that it is not difficult to appropriately generalize our calculations , so that one can give approximate , analytic description of propagation of such a localised excitation along the vortex , as well as of propagation of radiation wave emitted from the travelling excitation @xcite .",
    "solutions of this type have finite energy .",
