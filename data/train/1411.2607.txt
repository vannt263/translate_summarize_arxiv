    "over the recent decades , matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite and related numerical techniques have become the standard framework for simulating low energy states of local hamiltonians in 1d .",
    "mps with finite bond dimension provide an exact representation of the ground state only for a certain well - designed class of so - called parent hamiltonians ( such as the celebrated aklt model @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , for generic local gapped hamiltonians , mps of finite bond dimension approximate local quantities in the ground state essentially to arbitrary precision @xcite .",
    "for the long - range behavior of the system , however , this is not necessarily the case as correlations of mps with finite bond dimension by construction must decay purely exponentially at sufficiently long distances @xcite .",
    "the question of how well mps are able to reproduce correlations at long distances becomes particularly interesting in view of recent observations linking the minima of dispersion relations of elementary excitations of local , translationally invariant hamiltonian with the rate of decay of momentum - filtered correlations in its ground state @xcite .",
    "moreover , a novel interpretation of the transfer matrix obtained in the mps algorithm was also proposed in ref .  .",
    "namely , that it reproduces the quantum transfer matrix in the euclidean path - integral representation of the quantum state through a renormalisation group procedure equivalent to the seminal wilson s numerical renormalisation group @xcite . in that picture the physical spin is interpreted as an impurity and the mps transfer matrix contains only the subset of degrees of freedom , out of exponentially many for the quantum transfer matrix , which are relevant for description of its correlations .",
    "this interpretation still requires corroboration by explicit calculations , which we partially address in this article  see also ref . in that context .",
    "a closely related topic is that of the finite entanglement scaling at the critical point @xcite  a numerically established fact that in an mps approximation of the ground state of a critical system , there emerges a long - distance correlation length as an artifact of the finite bond dimension of the mps .",
    "the state exhibits scaling behavior as a function of growing bond dimension , and it is even possible to extract the conformal information about the critical point by analyzing it @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it remains an interesting topic to get a better understanding of how finite entanglement scaling arises .",
    "in this article we study a particular example where such questions can be addressed analytically , albeit in the framework of mps . to that end , in sec .",
    "ii , we show how to construct an exact mps representation of the ground state of the xy model  a prototypical spin model in one dimension  with in principle exponentially diverging bond dimension . as a corollary",

    "while this remark is not so important for zz correlation here , other correlation functions might have other exponents of the algebraic part at the critical point and away from it @xcite .    to summarize , notice that on the one hand the gap of the transfer matrix sets the correlation length while on the other hand , the full ( low energy part of the ) continuous band contributes _ equally _ ( in the sense of form factors being proportional to @xmath135 ) to form the algebraic part as a consequence of the nonflat dispersion relation .",

    "this happens e.g. for the xx correlation function in the paramagnetic phase .",

    "while such a procedure would be optimal for truncation at a single bond , in the infinite system it is performed at all sites simultaneously @xcite .",

    "even more , the spectra obtained with idmrg and with finite @xmath41 coincide rather well ( i.e. corresponding values of @xmath155 in eq .   are matching ) .",

    "this provides a strong hint that so called finite entanglement scaling @xcite  scaling observed while simulating the ( conformally invariant ) critical theory using mps with finite @xmath142  can be interpreted in a geometric way .",
    "this can not be seen that easily when looking directly at idmrg and the ratios of the dominant eigenvalues of the transfer matrix ( cf .",

    "more precisely , the physical spin at @xmath229 in the virtual direction in fig .  [ fig : network ] plays a distinguished role in this tensor network as physical operators are applied there during the calculation of expectation values .",
    "it can then be interpreted as an impurity in the two - dimensional tensor network and the degrees of freedom relevant for the description of impurity  and at the same time the concise description of the state in the mps algorithm  emerge as a result of application of wilson s numerical renormalisation group ( nrg ) @xcite to the quantum transfer matrix along the virtual ( imaginary time ) direction .",
    "qualitatively , this procedure boils down to dividing the continuous momenta @xmath230 into windows which are logarithmically shrinking toward @xmath110 ( minimum of @xmath225 ) , and representing each window by a single effective mode , as pictorially presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . the mode corresponding to the largest momentum represents the action of a few sites localized close to the impurity in the virtual direction ( small @xmath231 in fig .",

    "depend both on the bond dimension @xmath157 and the correlation length in the system , i.e. @xmath233 in the gapped system and @xmath234 in the critical one .",
