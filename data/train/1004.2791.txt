    "the luminosity of a supernova ( sn ) results from energy input by a combination of radioactive decay and shock kinetic energy ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for a type ii sn , the shape of the light curve depends on quantities like the star s initial radius , ejecta mass , and explosion energy @xcite . for sne with small initial radii , like sne of types ia , ib , ic , and peculiar sne  ii like sn  1987a that result from blue supergiants ,",
    "most of the shock - deposited thermal energy imparted to the stellar envelope is converted back into kinetic energy through adiabatic expansion , so nearly all of the observed luminosity comes from the radioactive decay of @xmath3ni and @xmath3co . in `` normal '' sne",
    "ii - p that result from the explosions of red supergiants ( rsgs ) , however , the large initial radius allows some modest fraction ( typically 12% ) of the shock - deposited thermal energy to be radiated away , powering much of the plateau of the lightcurve , although the vast majority still goes into expansion energy . at late times , even sne  ii - p have their luminosity powered by radioactive decay ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    subsequently , however , as the fast sn ejecta expand , they can collide with dense circumstellar or interstellar material ( csm / ism ) that may surround the sn . as a result",
    ", additional kinetic energy may be transformed once again back into thermal energy through shock heating , which in turn may be lost by radiative cooling if a dense radiative shock forms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this can enhance the luminosity for long after the explosion : som sne remain radio luminous for decades @xcite , and this interaction may power a visible supernova remnant ( snr ) such as cas  a for hundreds of years @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the collision with dense csm happens immediately after the explosion , it may significantly alter the spectrum and light curve of the sn itself .",
    "this latter scenario is generally thought to be the case for the observed sub - class of type  iin supernovae @xcite , where the `` n '' corresponds to `` narrow '' or intermediate - width h lines from the shock - heated csm gas or decelerated sn ejecta ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in a normal sn ,",
    "the expected results of radiative cooling and reheating of the sn ejecta due to radioactive decay yield can be estimated from analytical models of stellar structure and explosion physics @xcite . in sne with strong csm interaction such as the observed class of type  iin sne , however , the effects of collisions between an expanding sn and its circumstellar gas are harder to predict with _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "they depend highly on the density and morphology of the csm , which in turn depend on the unknown mass - loss behavior of the star in the few years prior to core collapse  potentially different for each object .",
    "a wide variety of csm environments are possible , leading to a wide diversity of observed lightcurves and spectral properties .",
    "recent observations of luminous type  iin supernovae such as sn  2006gy @xcite and sn  2006tf @xcite have stretched the boundaries of our understanding of sne  iin .",
    "their extreme luminosities yield strong evidence that the progenitors of these sne were surrounded by massive shells , presumably ejected in precursor eruptions during the final years of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the physical properties ( mass , speed , h composition ) of these mass ejections were analogous to those observed for giant eruptions of luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , and especially reminiscent of the giant 1843 eruption of @xmath4 carinae @xcite .",
    "as the sn ejecta expand , they collide with the recently ejected csm shell and this collision significantly decelerates the sn expansion , transforming kinetic energy back into thermal energy at the collision front , producing a brilliant fireworks display .",
    "the remarkably high luminosity and long duration of the observed emission from sne  2006gy and 2006tf imply that the circumstellar shells were very massive  of order 1020 @xmath2  in order to sufficiently decelerate the sn blast wave and tap into its available reservoir of kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued based on a simplified analytical model , similar to that of @xcite , that the high luminosity and long duration of these sne can be explained by a sn colliding with a very massive and initially opaque csm shell .",
    "we explore this idea here in more detail with a variety of possible csm environments using numerical simulations .",
    "we suggest that the presence and shape of circumstellar shells can be a powerful tool to constrain the evolution of the progenitors of type  iin supernovae .",
    "we investigate how the mass , speed , and morphology of such shells can influence the evolution of a sn lightcurve .",
    "we undertake a parameter study of sne with different masses interacting with a selection of possible circumstellar shells , both spherical and bipolar . from these simulations",
    "we calculate thermal emission profiles and compare them in order to constrain how the physical properties of circumstellar nebulae can influence the sn lightcurve , and to constrain the efficiency of converting kinetic energy to light .",
    "our calculations are simplified in the way we treat the cooling of and radiation from the shocked gas , which we approximate as optically thin radiative cooling ; by necessity ; our application of these results is therefore limited in scope .",
    "an important point to note is that our approach is to simulate a variety of hypothetical sne to demonstrate",
    "_ trends _ in how the lightcurve responds to changes in sn and shell properties .",
    "we are not attempting a quantitative fit to the observed data for any individual sn .",
    "this has been pursued for a few relatively nearby and well - observed sne iin , such as sn  1988z @xcite , sn  1994w @xcite , and sn  1998s @xcite , where the csm properties were derived from fitting the observed light curves and spectra .",
    "those authors inferred massive precursor shell ejections in the few years before core collapse , although the energy demands and required shell masses for these were not as extreme as for sne  2006tf and 2006gy .",
    "our work here builds upon these earlier studies .",
    "we explain our adopted initial conditions and the numerical method in  2 and  3 , respectively , and in  4 we discuss some details of the shock interaction . in  5",
    "we discuss how the resulting light curves depend on various parameters and in  6 we discuss shell velocities , and how these may help to interpret observations .",
    "finally , in  7 we interpret our results in context with the most luminous sne iin , and in  8 we provide a summary .",

    "in our simulations , we begin with a core - collapse sn in free expansion as described by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which gives a density profile divided in two segments : the inner part has @xmath25 , the outer part @xmath26 , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 for a progenitor star that still has a large hydrogen envelope at the moment of core collapse .",

    "we start each simulation of the csm interaction at the moment were the supernova has expanded to 1  au .",
    "typical maximum velocity for the initial supernova is about 30000  km / s .",
    "however , at this velocity the density is very low and the maximum velocity is quickly reduced to about 10000  km / s by the collision with the surrounding medium , once the simulation begins .",
    "the distance it must travel to collide with the shell depends on the shell parameters ( see   [ sec - csmmodel ] ) .",
    "our simulations do not include the effect of photo - ionization , nor do we take into account the effect of energy injection from radioactive decay .",
    "our calculations simulate only the expected luminosity generated by the sn - csm interaction shock front ; our simulated light curves do not include emission from the expanding sn photosphere powered by diffusion of shock - deposited energy or from radioactive decay .",
    "these may affect the light curve at lower csm - interaction luminosities or very early times before the shock overtakes much of the csm shell .",
    "note also , that our supernova model is strictly spherical .",
    "non - spherical sn ejecta outflows would greatly increase the parameter space and require a more complex calculation .      for the circumstellar shells ,",
    "we take a variety of shell properties , but we focus on models reminiscent of the environment of @xmath4 carinae @xcite , as such csm properties have been proposed for some luminous sn  iin .",
    "namely , we adopt a stellar wind with high mass - loss rate ( 10@xmath34 to 10@xmath35 @xmath2 yr@xmath36 ) and moderate velocity ( few hundred km s@xmath36 ) for the steady wind phase before and after shell ejection , plus an expanding shell with extremely high density that was ejected in an intermittent outburst reminiscent of giant lbv eruptions , occuring a few years before the sn .",
    "the mass - loss rate and velocity of the wind before and after the shell ejection are assumed to be identical",
    ". the supernova will therefore first encounter a ( relatively ) low density wind , then a short stretch of high density material and then once again the low density wind after it escapes the shell .",
    "we explore a large parameter space , covering a wide range of possible shell masses , velocities , wind mass - loss rates and ages .",
    "we also investigate the effect of a bipolar shell , such as might be ejected by a rapidly rotating star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the bipolar shape follows the gravitational darkening model for the wind of a rotating star as described by @xcite :    @xmath37    @xmath38    with @xmath39 , @xmath40 the rotational angular velocity of the star and @xmath41 the kepplerian angluar velocity .",
    "observations have shown that the bipolar shell of @xmath4  carinae , for example , follows this shape @xcite .",
    "the latitudinal angle @xmath42 equals zero at the pole and @xmath43 at the equator .",
    "note that this set of equations only applies for radiatively driven winds .",
    "should the star approach critical rotation during an eruption , mass could be focussed to the equator , forming a flattened equatorial structure as well @xcite .",
    "this is not accounted for in these equations .",
    "the total range of parameters in our simulations is listed in table  [ tab : sim ] . in all cases",
    "we assume that the shell ejection lasted two years , though we explore the effect of different shell cross - sections by varying the velocity .",
    "wind velocity and shell velocity are assumed to be the same , allowing us to use an analytical description , rather than a numerical model , for the shell morphology .",
    "the second to last column in table  [ tab : sim ] gives the efficiency of converting shock kinetic energy into radiated luminosity as found in our simulations , based on the input kinetic energy and the integrated luminosity in the light curve .",
    "this is the maximum efficiency corresponding to the bolometric luminosity output . the efficiency in converting shock kinetic energy to _ visual",
    "_ light must be comparable to or less than this value .",
    "finally , table  [ tab : sim ] shows the the velocity of the sn remnant after it has collided with the shell .",
    "we measure this velocity at a fixed point in time , except where indicated otherwise ; these exceptions are necessary due to the nature of the circumstellar medium , which may require a longer time interval before the supernova has broken through the shell . also , we do nt list a final velocity for those sne that interact with bipolar shells , since for thise simulations the velocity is angle - dependent .",
    "we use the zeus  3d code @xcite for our simulations .",
    "the grid is spherical and two - dimensional , with 500 gridcells along the radial axis and 100 gridcells along the asimuthal axis , covering a 90 degree angle from pole to equator .",
    "we have seeded both the initial supernova and the circumstellar nebula with small scale density fluctuations ( 5@xmath44 for the supernova ejecta and @xmath45 for the circumstellar medium ) .",
    "this ensures that the supernova breaks up the circumstellar shell upon collision .      in order to achieve a high resolution at the collision between supernova and circumstellar medium ,",
    "the size of the radial gridcells decreases with the radius .",
    "this gives us the highest resolution at the outer boundary . since we need to maintain this high resolution at the collision front , we use the moving grid option that is part of the zeus 3d code ( see @xcite ) . at the start of the simulation",
    "the freely expanding supernova fills the entire grid , with the exception of the outer radial boundary , which is set to an inflow boundary condition with the parameters of the circumstellar medium that the supernova is running into . at the end of each timestep",
    "the code finds the highest radial velocity within 50 radial gridcells of the outer boundary . using the velocity in this cell as a basis",
    "all gridcells are moved outward as well , with velocities :    @xmath46~=~ 2 v[ic ] \\frac{r[i ] - r[0]}{r[ic]-r[0]},\\ ] ]    with @xmath47 $ ] the radius of the gridcell with index @xmath48 , which runs from 0 to 500 , @xmath49 the index of the gridcell in which the radial velocity is highest and @xmath50 $ ] the highest radial velocity within 50 gridcells of the outer boundary .",
    "the physical conditions at the outer boundary are updated each time the grid expands to conform to the values of the circumstellar medium at that particular radius . in this way the entire grid is stretched in the radial direction , ensuring that a ) the supernova remnant can never overrun the outer boundary ; b ) a high resolution is always maintained close to the outer boundary where the collision takes place and c ) the inner boundary is fixed and does not move .",
    "( n.b . this method works well as long as one has to deal with a strong shock .",
    "it is not recommended for subsonic expansion ) .",
    "a drawback of this method is that the circumstellar nebula is supposed to be static during the sn expansion , whereas speeds of the pre - shock csm for luminous sne  iin seen in narrow p cygni absorption features tend to be of order 100500 km s@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "( the csm speeds listed in table 1 essentially determine the radii of the shells and therefore their density for an assumed total mass . )",
    "however , the velocities of the sn ejecta expansion are much faster than those in the csm nebula , such that any evolution of the nebula during the sn expansion phase can be considered small",
    ". the inner radial boundary is fixed at @xmath51 and does not move when the grid expands . the inner radial boundary and both azimuthal boundaries",
    "are set to reflecting boundary conditions so no matter can escape from the system .      in order to obtain a lightcurve from our simulation we include the effect of optically thin radiative cooling , using the cooling curve from @xcite .",
    "we extend this cooling curve to temperatures above @xmath52  k by assuming that for these temperatures the cooling curve depends on the temperature as @xmath53 ( i.e. , brehmstrahlung ) .",
    "rather than use the cooling routine that comes as part of the zeus  3d code , we implement a new numerical method , described by @xcite .",
    "this method uses exact integration of the radiative cooling function rather than the traditional implicit or explicit schemes .",
    "it is faster , more accurate and avoids the potential instability of the old radiative cooling method used in the zeus  3d code , which uses a newton - raphson implicit calculation scheme .",
    "the assumption of _ optically thin _",
    "radiative cooling to generate our lightcurves has some drawbacks .",
    "the circumstellar shells used in our simulations have high densities and are therefore likely to be optically thick to thomson scattering if fully ionized . however , at such high densities",
    ", it is difficult for the material to remain fully ionized because of fast recombination rates , we believe that our assumption is acceptable for our limited pruposes , at least as far as radiation in the optical part of the spectrum is concerned .",
    "the high density of the circumstellar shells makes it unlikely that ultraviolet the light from the sn itself can fully ionize them .",
    "those areas of the shell that become photo - ionized will undergo recombination on a very short timescale .",
    "typical mass density in the shell is about @xmath54 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : a03_10 ] through [ fig : d02_150 ] ) .",
    "assuming pure ionized hydrogen for the sake of simplicity this gives us an electron density @xmath55 of @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite give of recombination rate of    @xmath57    with @xmath58 .",
    "for an electron temperature @xmath59 of 10000  k , this gives us a recombination rate of @xmath60 per second .",
    "so even if fully ionized initially , the shell will recombine very quickly compared to the expansion of theshell .",
    "it takes the sn at least several days to reach the inner edge of the shell , so the effects of the initial ionization will most likely have disappeared by then , leaving only the remaining radiation from the expanding shock to photoionize the shell .",
    "this greatly reduces the number of free electrons that are available for scattering .",
    "furthermore , although we use a shell with a smooth density structure ( apart from the small random variations mentioned above ) , in reality circumstellar shells show a far more complicated structure of high density filaments interspaced between low density areas . under these circumstances , the photons will tend to escape through the low density regions @xcite .",
    "finally , scattering by itself does not necessarily change the shape of the emerging lightcurve since a photon can escape with little modification even after multiple scatterings . therefore , even though the electron scattering optical depth of our denser shells ( under assmption of full ionization ) , can be as large as @xmath61 , the true optical depth will be much smaller due to efficient recombination .",
    "the shape of the lightcurve will change if the diffusion time for photons to escape from the circumstellar shell gets close to the actual expansion time of the sn @xcite .",
    "however , this is only likely to affect the light curves at early times ; the net effect would be a slower rise time to peak luminosity and possibly a smoother peak , while diffusion is unlikely to substantially affect the overall efficiency of converting kinetic energy into radiation .",
    "the typical diffusion timescale of a photon through the shell is @xmath62 , with @xmath63 the optical depth , @xmath64 the cross - section of the shell and @xmath65 the speed of light , whereas the expansion velocity is @xmath66 . with the expansion velocity @xmath67 typically below 2000  @xmath68",
    "( see the shell velocity plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_a03 ] and also typical final velocities in table  [ tab : sim ] ) and lower for the denser , more optically thick shells , the photons have time to escape from the shell ahead of the expanding supernova .",
    "although we have attempted to account for radiative cooling in a realistic way in our calculations , this is a difficult problem and our method is simplified and necessarily limited .",
    "therefore , when interpreting our results , we concentrate on relative changes from one model to the next as we vary input parameters like mass and speed , rather than the absolute values of the luminosity for any individual model . as noted earlier , it is not our goal here to fit the observed lightcurve and derive corresponding physical parameters for any individual sn , but rather , we aim to understand how the variety of possible observed properties arises from different input parameters .",
    "here we describe the general properties of our sn - csm interaction simulations . as a sn interacts with the csm , we observe three phases dictated by our assumed input geometry : ( 1 ) a fast interaction between the sn and the ( relatively ) low - density wind inside the shell , ( 2 ) a slower interaction as the sn shock pushes into the much denser medium of the massive shell , and ( 3 ) the final expansion phase as the sn has broken through the shell and continues to interact with the wind outside the dense shell .    to demonstrate the strong interaction between a core - collapse sn and a circumstellar shell , consider simulation a03 ( table  [ tab : sim ] ) , in which a 30@xmath31 explosion collides with a 10@xmath31 circumstellar shell moving at 200@xmath68 .",
    "figures  [ fig : a03_10 ] to [ fig : a03_150 ] show snapshots of the temperature and density of the expanding sn as it interacts with the csm ( movies of our simulations are provided in the electronic edition ) . the high post - shock density encountered because of",
    "the very massive csm shells we use causes the radiative cooling to be extremely efficient in these simulations , sometimes reducing the internal energy of even the shocked gas to the point where the temperature reaches a minimum value of 1,000  k. ( this lower limit is a matter of numerical convenience that we impose upon the calculation . ) since the temperature difference before and after cooling can be quite large , we show the temperature of the gas before the radiative cooling has been taken into account , which is more representative for the wavelength of the emitted radiation .",
    "this is the same temperature that we use to obtain the lightcurves in ",
    "[ sec - lcurve ] , adjusted for adiabatic expansion .    at first , the sn ejecta expand quickly as the forward shock encounters the stellar wind , creating a layer of hot ( several times @xmath69 ) , shocked gas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a03_10 ] ) . at the inner boundary of this high temperature zone ( the reverse shock ) ,",
    "sn material piles up and creates a shell .",
    "the interaction is ( nearly ) energy conserving at this point .",
    "when gas crosses the reverse shock , the kinetic energy of the sn is converted to internal energy and heats the shocked gas , pushing the forward shock into the csm .",
    "the shell , which is very thin due to radiative cooling , is subject to thin - shell instabilities .",
    "however , these take time to form and the shell is expanding rapidly , which limits their opportunity to grow . as a result , the shell retains its basically spherical shape .",
    "because only a small fraction of the sn material has a high velocity ( see   [ sec - snmodel ] ) , the blast wave slows down quickly when it sweeps up the wind .",
    "this effect is greatly increased in the next phase when the sn ejecta collide with the dense circumstellar shell .",
    "initially , the collision between sn ejecta and a massive circumstellar shell causes a rapid decrease of the forward shock velocity .",
    "this deceleration drains energy from the forward shock , _ and powers the main peak of the light curve_. the density at the forward shock increases sharply as the shock overtakes more of the massive circumstellar shell .",
    "the layer of hot , shocked gas is compressed as the reverse shock starts to overtake the forward shock , which leads to an increase in local temperature ( @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig : a03_20 ] ) .",
    "the high temperature , combined with the high density of the gas makes the radiative cooling efficient .",
    "therefore the thermal pressure of the shocked gas does not increase further .",
    "this , combined with the compression between the two shocks causes the hot gas layer to become quite thin and marks the transition from an energy conserving shock to a momentum conserving one .",
    "as the forward motion slows , the shock temperature decreases .",
    "the cooling remains efficient , so the high temperature region , which is now at about @xmath71 , remains thin ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : a03_75 ] ) .",
    "the thin shocked gas layer is subject to radiative cooling instability ( the higher density regions cool more efficiently , leading to a loss of thermal pressure , which in turn leads them to be compressed to even higher density ) .",
    "this can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : a03_75 ] as variations in the local temperature in the shocked gas .",
    "however , like in the initial phase , the expansion of the sn occurs at higher velocity than the formation of the instabilities . also , the shocked gas layer is compressed between two areas with very high density ( the shell on the outside and the rest of the supernova on the inside ) , which inhibits expansion apart from the bulk motion of the shock .",
    "therefore , there is no significant departure from spherical symmetry .",
    "once the sn breaks through the shell , the forward shock may accelerate again due to the transition to much lower densities in the wind , though it will never reach the original high velocity because a large amount of energy has been lost to radiation during the shell collision phase .",
    "also , the velocity of the unshocked sn ejecta piling up at the reverse shock decreases over time , limiting the shell s ability to accelerate in this later phase . as a result ,",
    "the temperature of the hottest shocked gas is now limited to a few times @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a03_150 ] ) .",
    "the lower density at the interaction front makes the radiative cooling less efficient , which allows the hot gas layer to build up , though it never reaches its original size .",
    "the collision between a sn and a bipolar nebula shows the same general pattern as described above , but is somewhat more complicated and modified by the shell geometry .",
    "figures  [ fig : d02_10 ] through [ fig : d02_150 ] show the same time frames for simulation d02 , which models a collision between the same sn as in simulation a03 with a 10@xmath31 shell , but here the shell is bipolar .",
    "initially ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d02_10 ] ) the simulations look the same as before , but they diverge once the sn hits the circumstellar shell .",
    "this occurs first at the pinched equatorial waist of the nebula , where the shell radius is smallest ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d02_20 ] ) .",
    "the collision squeezes the region of shocked gas into a very thin layer . in polar directions",
    ", the sn still expands into a lower - density wind and the hot gas layer remains wide . at a later stage ,",
    "the interaction with the shell has slowed the expansion at the equator , leading to a lower shock temperature ( @xmath7310@xmath74 k in fig .",
    "[ fig : d02_75 ] ) , whereas the shock temperature at the pole is still high because the shock has only just reached the circumstellar shell and has not swept - up enough mass to decelerate yet .",
    "eventually , the sn will start to break out of the shell at the equator first , while it is still inside the shell at the pole ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : d02_150 ] ) . when this happens , the shock at the equator will reheat to about @xmath75  k , while the temperature at the pole remains low .",
    "since the circumstellar shell has most of its mass concentrated at the pole ( where it also has the largest solid angle ) , it takes much longer for the sn to break out in that direction . as a result , the shock in the polar direction will always be less energetic afterwards than at the equator .",
    "because of the different times when the shock hits the equatorial and polar regions of the shell , different shock temperatures can be seen simultaneously .",
    "we therefore suggest that simultaneous observations of multiwavelength ( i.e. x - ray and visual ) light curves may provide a way to distinguish bipolar from spherical shells , as we describe in more detail later .",
    "the assumption of optically thin cooling , though a reasonable approximation in optical wavelengths , breaks down for high frequencies .",
    "most likely , for massive shell collisions , the early - time x - rays and uv would be completely self - absorbed and reprocessed into visual - wavelength luminosity .",
    "therefore , rather than attempt to plot the emission as a function of the gas temperature , we concentrate on the bolometric luminosity light curves as a likely proxy for the visual lightcurves in later sections ; this assumption may break down at late times when the shock becomes optically thin and x - rays can escape ( see below ) .",
    "in addition , it is important to note that our light curves correspond only to radiative energy losses from the post - shock gas .",
    "we do not include the photospheric emission from the underlying sn itself , which could , in principle , be any type of sn .",
    "( it is the shell collision that leads to a type iin spectrum and the enhanced luminosity , rather than any intrinsic property of the sn . )",
    "as is shown below , the overall shape of the lightcurve for any sn - csm collision model has the same general properties .",
    "initially , the sn expands into the ( relatively ) low - density wind , starting at high luminosity due to its high velocity .",
    "as the expanding shock sweeps up more wind material , the expansion speed is reduced and the lightcurve shows a corresponding decrease in luminosity .",
    "note that the behavior in this early phase  while the shock propagates through the wind on its way to reach the inner radius of the dense shell  depends strongly on our assumed value for the inner radius of the shell and on the assumed time before the sn when the shell ejection finished ( @xmath76 in table 1 ) .",
    "if the sn had occurred immediately after the shell ejection stopped or while it was still in progress , then this early phase would not exist .",
    "this may be an important consideration in determining the early light curve shape : some luminous sne like sn  2006gy and sn  2005gj show a long and slow rise to peak luminosity @xcite , while others are discovered at peak and decline immediately , as in the cases of sne  1998s , 1997cy , and 2006tf @xcite , suggesting a very rapid initial rise time .",
    "when the supernova reaches the circumstellar shell , which takes on the order of 10 - 25 days in most of our simulations , the expansion decelerates abruptly .",
    "this shows up as a rapid increase of the emission , because the fraction of kinetic energy converted into thermal energy is now high also , the very high density of the shocked gas causes it to radiate very efficiently .",
    "as the sn plows through the shell , the emission decreases again due to the general decrease in shock velocity , but remains high compared to the emission from the initial phase .",
    "once the sn has overtaken the massive shell and begins to expand into the outer low - density wind ( at @xmath77140 days ) , the total emission decreases because the density of the gas that the sn collides with has decreased . unlike the previous phases while the blast wave was expanding inside and through the massive shell , the densities are relatively low , and so optical depth effects are less likely to cause complete self - absorption of high energy photons .",
    "thus , once the blast wave has broken through the outer boundary of a hypothetical massive shell , we would predict that soft x - ray emission could in fact be observed .",
    "mass - loss rates derived from observations of this x - ray emission would trace the normal wind mass - loss rate of the progenitor star in the years _ before _ it ejected the massive dense shell that led to the enhanced optical luminosity ; meanwhile , the optical luminosity is still being emitted by teh dense shell .",
    "therefore , one would not necessarily expect agreement in mass - loss rates derived from observed optical and x - ray luminosities ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . as the sn blast wave continues to expand into the wind",
    ", it gradually decelerates because the amount of swept - up gas increases over time .",
    "this leads to a steady and slow reduction in total emission in the years after the initial collision .",
    "since both the circumstellar shell and the sn are spherically symmetric , the collision happens at the same moment everywhere .",
    "similarly , the sn will break through the shell at the same time all around its circumference . as a result , both sides of the main peak in the lightcurve have very steep slopes , and the change in x - ray emission would most likely be quite sudden .",
    "this is partly a result of our prescribed geometry of the shell , with a clean inner and outer boundary .",
    "real circumstellar shells can show a wide variety of different geometries , including multiple shells and high degrees of clumping , which can vastly change the appearance of the lightcurves .",
    "as one example , we explore the influence that a bipolar shape has on the emergent light curve .",
    "our point here is not to provide an exhaustive grid of simulations of possible light curves , but to simply illustrate the behavior as we vary the parameters of the collision in order to guide the interpretation of lightcurves of luminous sne .",
    "the responses of the light curves to various parameters of the wind and shell are described in the following sections .",
    "the most important consequence of the sn - shell collision is that sn kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy and then lost to radiation .",
    "the efficiency of this conversion is a key parameter for interpreting the energy budgets of sne iin . for each simulation discussed below",
    ", we list the total efficiency in converting kinetic energy into radiated energy over the course of the simulation , @xmath78 , in the second to final column of table 1 .",
    "we find a large range in the conversion efficiency , depending on the mass of the shell as well as the mass of the sn .",
    "for a circumstellar shell mass of 10  @xmath2 , the efficiency is typically 1530% .",
    "efficiency increases with increasing density of the circumstellar shell ( higher shell mass , slower velocity , or both ) .",
    "the efficiency also increases for lighter sne ( higher ratios of @xmath79 ) , because of momentum conservation and the greater deceleration of the fast sn ejecta .",

    "both the luminosity and post - shock shell velocity start high , but decline quickly as the sn sweeps into the dense wind .    however , an important point to take away from simulation o01 is that the peak luminosity at early times is less than 10@xmath82 ergs s@xmath36 , and is therefore likely to be dwarfed by much stronger emission from an underlying sn photosphere ( not shown in fig .",

    "the higher energy sn has higher speeds at later phases during the collision . ]",
    "an important observational parameter for sne  iin , in addition to their radiative luminosity and total radiated energy measured from light curves , is the expansion speeds measured from line widths in spectra . in most sne ,",
    "the ejecta expansion speeds are inferred from p cygni absorption features in the photospheric spectra , and this can be done in sne iin if the underlying photosphere can be seen @xcite .",
    "often , however , the underlying sn photosphere is masked by the bright and possibly opaque emission from the dense shell of post - shock gas that powers the excess luminosity in sne  iin ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , the dense shell of shocked gas that piles up at the contact discontinuity in the sn - csm collision can be seen in the intermediate - width wings of the narrow h@xmath101 emission lines , for example , and typically has a speed of a few 10@xmath105  @xmath68 @xcite .    in order to estimate how the presence of a circumstellar shell influences the velocity of the post - shock gas seen in h@xmath101 emission , we plot the velocity of shocked gas as a function of time : specifically , we plot the mass - averaged radial velocity of the gas between the forward shock ( @xmath106 ) and the reverse shock ( @xmath107 ) @xmath108 we choose this method to quantify the shocked gas velocity because it gives a good result both in the adiabatic and radiative shock regime .",
    "mass averaging rather than volume averaging is more realistic since the luminosity is highly density dependent , so high density areas would dominate the emission .",
    "the behavior of the shocked gas velocity during the sn - shell collision generally proceeds as follows : initially , the velocity drops exponentially , because the blast wave declerates while sweeping up the surrounding wind .",
    "when the forward shock hits the circumstellar shell it practically halts and the reverse shock velocity drops abruptly as the gas between the two shocks is compressed .",
    "after the initial collision the shocked gas velocity increases again as the forward shock recovers .",
    "however , the velocity is now much lower since the interaction has become radiative , so much of the available energy has already been lost .",
    "also , the forward shock is now moving through a much denser medium .",
    "although the forward shock accelerates again as it breaks out of the shell and runs down a steep density gradient , it never recovers its original velocity , as is true for the reverse shock .",
    "the forward shock interaction does become nearly adiabatic again ( see   [ sec - sn - csm ] ) , so the velocity remains higher than during the collision with the shell . by this time",
    "the shell has gained substantial mass through sweeping up the surrounding medium .",
    "therefore its forward momentum is high , and the velocity remains nearly constant for a long period of time because the outer wind has insufficient mass to decelerate it .",
    "the abrupt loss of forward velocity in the reverse shock shell is , in principle , a robust characteristic of sn - shell interaction . whether or not it is actually observable",
    ", however , is unclear .",
    "if the density of the pre - shock csm is high , as it needs to be in the case of the more luminous sne iin , then one might expect the pre - shock gas to be very optically thick @xcite and the emitting surface may be well outside the shock . in that case , the observed h@xmath101 line profile would be dominated by the narrow component from photoionized pre - shock gas ( typically a few 10@xmath109  @xmath68 ) and broad electron scattering wings ( e.g. , @xcite ) out to a few 10@xmath105  @xmath68 .",
    "this is indeed thought to be the case for sn  2006gy , as discussed in detail by @xcite .    the _ final _ shocked gas velocity , on the other hand , should be easily observable in all cases because of lower optical depths at larger radii and at late times , and may therefore provide an unambiguous constraint on the csm mass and sn energy . in figure",
    "[ fig : v_mshell ] , which shows the velocity for the same simulations as fig  [ fig : l_mshell ] , we can see that the final velocity does in fact depend strongly on the mass of the circumstellar shell .",
    "if the shell mass is relatively high , the velocity decreases by a larger amount as momentum is conserved .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_v_mdot ] , we show the shocked gas velocity for the same simulations as figure  [ fig : l_v_mdot ] .",
    "this demonstrates the effect of the wind velocity and mass - loss rate on the shocked gas velocity . as all sne",
    "have the same total energy in these simulations , the higher mass sne start out with lower velocity .",
    "as can be seen , the mass - loss rate only matters in the initial stage , before the collision between the sn and the circumstellar shell .",
    "the wind velocity does make a significant difference as it determines the location of the shell relative to the star and therefore the timetable of the interactions , but it does not strongly influence the final speed of the shocked shell .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_v_msn ] , which shows the reverse shock velocity for the same simulations as figure  [ fig : l_v_msn ] , we demonstrate the effect of the mass of the sn ejecta on the reverse shock velocity .",
    "as all sne have the same total energy in these simulations , the higher mass sne start out with lower velocity .",
    "as the ejecta collide with the 10@xmath31 shell , the lower mass sne slow down more , since they have less momentum .",
    "still , after the collision , the lowest mass sn is still moving with the highest velocity and is the first to break out of the circumstellar shell .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : v_esn ] shows the reverse shock velocities for sne with the same mass , but different total energy .",
    "the high energy sne start out with higher velocities , but also lose more energy in the collision . since the collision takes place at an earlier stage ,",
    "they slow down more , so the final difference in velocities is much less than initially .",
    "however , the total sn kinetic energy is perhaps the most influential factor in determining the final shell speed .    because of the specific nature of the collision , their are several different features that can determine the observed shock velocity of the sn .",
    "to illustrate this effect , we show three alternative velocity curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_a03 ] , all based on simulation a03 .",
    "a ) the velocity of the reverse shock , b ) the velocity of the gas that has passed through the reverse shock , and c ) the velocity of the shocked gas that has the highest density .",
    "initially , all three curves move together .",
    "the gas flow of shocked gas is slightly faster than the reverse shock itself , since this gas is actually moving through the shock . before the collision with the circumstellar shell",
    "the highest density of shocked gas is at the reverse shock , since this is where the sn ejecta piles up .",
    "this changes once the supernova collides with the shell .",
    "the reverse shock recoils from the collision , stopping completely or even reversing , depending on the density of the shell .",
    "the gas velocity inside the shock decreases as well , but not as much , since this is governed by the shock conditions .",
    "the shock changes from adiabatic to isothermal , restricting the velocity jump over the shock . as the sn then ploughs through the shell , the location of the highest density feature changes .",
    "it is no longer at the reverse shock , but rather at the forward shock , where gas from the shell is being swept up .",
    "therefore , the flow speed of the high density feature actually becomes lower than the velocity of the reverse shock , since we are now sampling gas that is still in the process of being accelerated .",
    "once the blast wave breaks out of the shell , the original situation is recreated , as once more the highest density occurs at the reverse shock and the shock conditions change back from isothermal to adiabatic .    examining figures  [ fig : v_mshell ] through [ fig : v_a03 ] , one can see that velocities measured in spectra obtained at early times can be powerful diagnostics of the rapid changes occurring during the initial shell collision , while later spectra that provide estimates of the final coasting velocity of the cds _ are key diagnostics of the energy and momentum budget of the explosion_. a potential complication for the early - time velocities , especially with more luminous sne  iin , may arise of the inner csm is very optically thick .",
    "if the csm outside the shock is highly opaque , then a radiative precursor may cause the photosphere to reside outside the shock @xcite , in which case the observed velocities are not indicative of the true expansion speed . in any case ,",
    "combinations of photometry and spectra at early times while the sn is still on the rise to peak are quite valuable in breaking the degeneracy of various models .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown how circumstellar shells can influence the evolution of both the observed sn lightcurve and the observed velocity .",
    "the presence of a substantially dense circumstellar shell always causes an increase in the radiative luminosity , lasting until the blast wave breaks through the shell .",
    "the height of this luminosity peak depends primarily on the density of the shell ( and so , also on its total mass and speed ) , in the sense that denser shells invariably lead to higher luminosities for the same underlying sne .",
    "the duration of the luminosity peak is a direct consequence of the time it takes the blast wave to propagate though the shell , so it depends on the total mass of the shell , its expansion speed , and its inner and outer radii ( i.e. the _ duration _ of the pre - sn ejection episode ) .",
    "a relatively more massive shell produces a slower blast wave , increasing the duration of the light curve peak and causing a higher luminosity . a faster expansion speed for the shell will also stretch the duration of the light curve peak by increasing its outer radius , but will make it less luminous for the same mass",
    ".    in our simulations , typical luminosity peaks for spherical shells tend to have a flat plateau , which is either horizontal , or angled downward as the shock velocity decreases over time .",
    "the beginning and end of the light curve peaks are clearly defined with sharp edges , but this is just a result of our simplifying assumption that the shell has sharp inner and outer boundaries ; real shells may have more complicated density profiles .",
    "these characteristics tend to disappear if the nebula is bipolar in shape , because different latitudes in the bipolar shell are hit by the blast wave at different times , and so the light curve shape is smoother .    whereas the total luminosity and the visual luminosity peak when the blast wave collides with the circumstellar shell , the temperature of the emitting gas decreases as the shock slows .",
    "a gradual decline in the characteristic temperature inferred from the continuum slope in visual - wavelength spectra or multi - band photometry has been seen in several well - studied examples of very luminous sne  iin , such as sn  2005gj , sn  2006gy , and sn  2006tf @xcite .",
    "the x - ray drop may not be observed if initial phases are optically thick and x - rays are fully absorbed and reprocessed .",
    "trapping at high optical depths is an effect that we have not included directly in our simulations ; we consider it likely , therefore , that the visual radiation will trace the bolometric luminosity at early times , as we discussed earlier .",
    "this is why we have shown the bolometric luminosity light curve in our plots .",
    "luminosity at high energies increases again once the sn breaks out of the shell and interacts with the ( relatively ) low - density wind outside the shell .",
    "this change in shock temperature is less clearly defined if the shell is bipolar , because both high - velocity and low - velocity interactions can occur simultaneously in different parts of the shell .",
    "a clumpy csm may produce a similar effect .",
    "the observed velocity evolution of the dense post - shock h shell depends strongly on the csm density and sn energy in our simulations .",
    "this velocity decreases steeply in the earliest phase of the expansion when the blast wave sweeps through the wind inside the dense csm shell , and then it takes another drop when the shock hits the circumstellar shell",
    ". however , these velocities in the earliest phases may be difficult to observe because of high optical depth effects that are not taken into account in our simulations , as noted above for the early light curve shape .",
    "the characteristic velocity observed _ after _ the sn / shell collision ends depends on the shell mass , sn mass , and the total explosion energy , and is typically 13 @xmath33 10@xmath110 @xmath68 in our simulations .",
    "this is comparable to the observed linewidths in luminous sne  iin like sn  2006tf @xcite or sn  2005gj @xcite .",
    "the faster speeds of @xmath734,000 km s@xmath36 in sn  2006gy @xcite imply a higher energy explosion and a relatively high - mass sn .",
    "indeed , @xcite estimated an explosion energy of at least 5@xmath3310@xmath32 ergs for sn  2006gy .",
    "the mass and initial speed of sn ejecta ( and hence , the total explosion energy ) also influence the evolution of the velocity .",
    "sne with higher ejecta mass have higher inertia and are decelerated less , but they also have slower initial expansion speeds for explosions assumed to have the same total kinetic energy , and so they can end up with slower final expansion speeds .",
    "a more energetic and relatively more massive sn explosion will emerge from the shell collision episode with a faster final shock speed . since there is some degeneracy in any one type of observed property , spectral observations of the pre - shock csm speed , the post - shock shell , and the sn ejecta speeds ( if they can be seen ) are valuable to combine with estimates of the luminosity from photometry to derive the physical properties of the csm interaction .",
    "erg running into 200 km / s shells of various masses ( `` a '' models , plus b02 and b04 ) .",
    "the unfilled triangles and squares are similar but for csm speeds of 50 and 500 @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "the filled circles are models f01 , a03 , and f02 , showing the effect of different explosion energy for the same shell paramters .",
    "the x s show models g01 , h01 , and c01 ( all with @xmath111 = 200 km s@xmath36 ) , special cases that have extended csm mass or lower - mass sn ejecta . ]      since some very luminous sne  iin have measured values for their total radiated energy approaching or even exceeding the canonical sn explosion kinetic energy of 10@xmath32 erg , the efficiency at which they convert some fraction of their initial kinetic energy into post - shock thermal energy and then radiation is key . in the shell - shocked model @xcite , high efficienies are allowable because of the large radius at which shock energy is thermalized , allowing the sn to radiate before it expands and loses that thermal energy adiabatically . the second to last column of table 1 lists the efficiency of this conversion as the ratio of the total energy lost via radiation in each simulation to the initial explosion kinetic energy of the sn , or @xmath112 . in figure",
    "[ fig : efficiency ] we plot this efficiency as a function of another ratio , which is the csm shell mass compared to the total mass in both the sn ejecta and csm .",
    "we show the results for several simulations to demontrate various trends .",
    "the basic result is that efficient conversion of sn kinetic energy into radiation via csm interaction requires a csm mass that is comparable to or larger than the mass of the sn ejecta .",
    "the primary criterion for luminous sne  iin that result from core - collapse sne is therefore the presence of several @xmath31 of circumstellar gas which must have been ejected very shortly before the sn .",
    "explosions of very massive stars can have csm interaction that is not very luminous if the csm mass is small compared to the sn ejecta mass ( as long as the sn ejecta are slow and heavy for a standard energy ) .",
    "a very effective way to convert a larger fraction of the total initial energy ( more than half ) into radiation is to have a more extended csm shell at the same density , as in simulation b04 , tracing mass loss for a longer time prior to the sn explosion",
    ". of course , the longer a simulation runs into csm material , the more kinetic energy can be converted into light  if one waits for @xmath73100 yr or more , an extended sn remnant can tap a significant fraction of the total energy .",
    "our aim here , however , is to study objects that do this very quickly in @xmath731 yr and thereby produce high luminosities during the initial light curve peak .",
    "the pre - shock csm speed also has some minor effect on the efficiency , in the sense that slower csm speeds lead to denser environments that trap more of the available kinetic energy because of their denser post - shock gas , and consequently , more efficient cooling .",
    "also mildly influential is the speed of the sn ejecta , or equivalently , the sn explosion kinetic energy .",
    "more energetic explosions are more efficient in converting their available energy reservoir to radiation due to the higher velocity drop at the reverse shock .",
    "thus , mild increases in explosion energy offer an alternative to exceedingly massive csm shells in order to produce very luminous sne  iin .",
    "again , however , the csm must be extended and massive in order to maintain that high luminosity for an extended time .     sn and 20 @xmath2 shell ; dotted grey ) , b02 ( 10 @xmath2 sn and 10 @xmath2 shell ; solid grey ) , and b04 ( 10 @xmath2 sn and 25 @xmath2 shell ; dark grey ) .",
    "model b04 is the same as b02 except that the shell has a larger outer radius ( it is thicker at the same density ) and therefore has a larger total mass .",
    "while these models may account for the peak luminosities of sn  2006tf , they fall short of the peak luminosity for sn  2006gy and they fade too quickly for both .",
    "it is likely that simulations with more extended and more massive csm shells or more energetic sne need to be explored in these two particuar cases .",
    "the very late time data at around 400 d for sn  2006gy may have some contribution from a light echo ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the late - time luminosity after 1 yr for sn  2006tf is dominated by strong ongoing csm interaction because strong h@xmath101 emission is seen in the late - time spectrum @xcite . for a typical type iip lightcurve ,",
    "see figs .",
    "[ fig : l_o0123 ] and [ fig : l_mshell ] . ]",
    "the central motivation for this study was to explore shock interaction with dense pre - sn csm shells as a possible engine for the visual light from the emerging class of extremely luminous sne , and to ask whether observed light curves can be compared to expectations of hydrodynamic simulations in order to constrain the physical properties of those shells and the underlying sne .",
    "below we briefly mention two recent well - observed examples that have been our primary objects for comparison : ( 1 ) sn  2006gy @xcite was the first of these super - luminous sne that raised many questions about our understanding of the power sources for these objects and about massive star evolution , and ( 2 ) sn  2006tf @xcite which was nearly as luminous . both have optical spectra of type  iin suggesting the presence of dense csm , although sn  2006tf appears to fit the canonical picture of csm interaction as the power source with fewer complications @xcite . both appear to have high optical depths at early phases .",
    "the energy sources for these two sne are of particular interest because , unlike more common sne iin at lower luminosity , their total radiated energy severely taxes the total sn energy budget : the energy radiated in visual light was 0.7@xmath3310@xmath32 ergs for sn  2006tf @xcite and 1.6@xmath3310@xmath32 ergs for sn  2006gy @xcite . making a bolometric correction based on the observed temperature yields @xmath113 erg for sn  2006gy , and including the kinetic energy remaining in the shell pushes the total initial explosion energy to at least 5@xmath3310@xmath32 erg @xcite . for sn  2006gy , a pair instability sn or diffusion from an opaque shocked shell",
    "have also been suggested as possibilities for powering the observed luminosity @xcite , although detailed analysis of its spectral evolution favors the opaque shocked shell model @xcite .",
    "two other sne , sn 2005ap @xcite and sn 2008es @xcite , have also been discovered recently to be among the most luminous sne known .",
    "in fact , their peak luminosities are somewhat higher than sn  2006gy , although they faded more quickly .",
    "we do not consider these for direct comparison with the same type of model discussed here because their spectra are not of type  iin , but rather , they had normal broad - lines in their spectra indicating a photosphere receding through fast ejecta .",
    "the lack of narrow emission lines makes it likely that their radiation is produced primrily by diffusion from an opaque shocked envelope , as in the model of @xcite , but with a smaller envelope mass than for sn  2006gy .",
    "the parameters in some of our simulations with slower ( and therefore more dense ) csm and higher conversion efficiencies , such as b01 , might be appropriate for these objects if diffusion were properly accounted for .",
    "alternatively , it has recently been suggested that these sne may powered by the birth of magnetars @xcite , energizing the opaque sn ejecta from within .",
    "we did not tune models specifically to fit the observed light curves of sne  2006gy and 2006tf , but we did explore a range of parameters for combinations of sne and csm shells comparable to relevant parameters estimated from observations @xcite . among our models , some of the highest peak luminosities were attained with relatively low mass ( and therefore fast ) sne running into slower csm shells , such as b01 and b02 ( 10 @xmath2 sne ) , or a07 , a09 , and a11 ( slower 50 km s@xmath36shells ) . although these models achieved very high peak luminosities comparable to those of the most luminous observed sne  iin , they faded too quickly , and so they fall far short of achieving the duration and total radiated light output of events like sne  2006gy and 2006tf .",
    "lower mass - sne run out of momentum too quickly , or over - run the compact csm shells too quickly .",
    "these low- and moderate - mass models may be applicable to sne  2005ap and 2008es , which attained high peak luminosities and faded quickly as mentioned above .",
    "again , an important consideration is that our models do not include the possible delayed effects of diffusion when high optical depths are important , as one might expect for massive and slow ( and therefore dense ) csm shells @xcite .",
    "including this may produce a smoother light curve @xcite , especially in the sense that it would dmpen and round - out the sharp initial peak in many of our simulations .",
    "thus , it is possible that models such as b01 could be dominated by diffusion and may not appear as sne of type iin , but confirming this conjecture requires additional work beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "diffusion through an opaque shell , however , would not alter the later phases of our light curves after maximum light .",
    "there were some models that came close to matching the lightcurve behavior of sne  2006gy and 2006tf with both high luminosity and relatively long durations .",
    "these were models with sne that had very massive and extended shells of 1025 @xmath2 , although even these seemed somewhat insufficient .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare ] compares the observed light curves of these two sne ( data from @xcite ) to models a04 , b02 , and b04 .",
    "all of these have shell expansion speeds of 200 km s@xmath36 , close to the observed values of pre - shock material for sne  2006tf and 2006gy @xcite .",
    "the light curve of sn  2006tf shows a slow and steady decline from peak luminosity , the approximate rate of which is reproduced in all three models shown . in our simulations",
    ", this decline rate is mainly due to the deceleration of the post - shock gas as the sn ejecta sacrifice energy to radiation .",
    "an interesting result is that this decline rate during the main light curve peak for model b04 roughly matches the radioactive decay rate of @xmath3co , even though there is no luminosity from radioactivity included in these simulations  in other words , luminosity from shock - csm interaction alone can in some cases mimic the radioactive decay rate .",
    "( one might also expect a similar decline from a steeper density gradient in the csm shell , or a different velocity / density law in the sn ejecta . in sn  2006gy ,",
    "for example , recent evidence points to a hubble - like expansion law in the csm @xcite .",
    "however , none of the models sustain the high luminosity for a long - enough time .",
    "sn  2006tf shows relatively high luminosity above 10@xmath80 ergs s@xmath36 even at very late times _ more than 1 yr after peak _ , consistent with a continuation of the same decay rate , but all three models in figure  [ fig : compare ] drop long before that time . in our simulations , this drop occurs when the forward shock exits the outer boundary of the dense shell and continues into the lower - density exterior wind shed by the star before it ejected the csm shell . a similar drop in luminosity",
    "was observed in the light curve of sn  1994w , and was also attributed to the shock overruning the outer boundary of a csm shell @xcite .",
    "this sharp drop is not usually seen in the light curves of sne  iin , however , suggesting that most sne  iin have more extended csm shells .",
    "we explored the effect that changing the outer shell boundary has on the light curves .",
    "models b02 and b04 , both shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] , are identical up to the point when the radius of the outer shell boundary is reached in model b02 . at this time , occurring around day 100 , the luminosity in model b02 plummets as the shock runs out of dense csm to interact with . in model b04",
    ", however , we simply continued the same shell properties to a larger radius by having the shell ejection occur with the same mass - loss rate over a longer time interval ( @xmath103=5 yr instead of 2 yr , both ending 2 yr before core collapse ) .",
    "thus , the slow decline from peak luminosity continued at roughly the same rate until day @xmath73260 , when its forward shock reached the outer shell boundary and the luminosity finally plummeted . this larger outer radius required a much larger shell mass , increased from 10  @xmath2 in model b02 to 25  @xmath2 in model b04 .",
    "the general shape and luminosity of model b04 is similar to the 25  @xmath2 shell model that woosley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested for sn  2006gy , although @xcite noted that it also fit the early light curve of sn  2006tf well .",
    "a shell mass of 25  @xmath2 is near the limit of what one might believe from a non - terminal stellar outburst if giant eruptions of lbvs like @xmath4  carinae are representative @xcite .",
    "shell masses beyond 25  @xmath2 also begin to press the most basic limitations of even a very massive star s mass budget at the end of its life ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "however , even the extremely massive shell of 25  @xmath2 in model b04 can not sustain a high luminosity long enough to account for the + 1 yr observations of sn  2006tf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ) because it drops too soon .",
    "instead , the late - time luminosity of sn  2006tf seems to continue the same slow decline rate .",
    "the corresponding csm shell mass that this would imply ( roughly 50  @xmath2 ) is staggering if the continued high luminosity were the result of simply extending the same shell to larger radii .",
    "one way to avoid such implausibly high shell mass would be to lower the density of the envelope but increase the total sn explosion energy above 10@xmath32 ergs .",
    "higher explosion energy leads to faster sn ejecta speed , so consequently , higher instantaneous luminosity can be achieved with lower shell densities .",
    "a larger explosion energy also relieves some of the strain on the efficiency of converting kinetic energy into light , since the total radiated energy of sn  2006tf is almost 10@xmath32 ergs .",
    "this sn presents additional challenges , since the total radiated energy actually exceeded 10@xmath32 ergs @xcite , requiring a more energetic sn explosion no matter what the csm properties are .",
    "none of our models were able to achieve the combination of the high peak luminosity and long duration of sn  2006gy , although our most energetic sn explosion was only 2@xmath3310@xmath32 ergs .",
    "following the arguments above for sn  2006tf , then , one might expect that models with a more energetic explosion could match the light curve of sn  2006gy without having implausibly high csm mass @xcite .",
    "for example , the smooth light curve shape and slow rise to maximum are traits that were seen in our simulations with bipolar csm shells , so one can imagine that a set of parameters similar to model d02 but with higher explosion energy may account for the light curve of sn  2006gy .",
    "this will be explored in a future paper .",
    "diffusion from opaque shocked shell may also lead to a smooth light curve appropriate for sn  2006gy @xcite , and we have not included these high optical depth effects in our simulations .",
    "in this paper we describe the influence of massive circumstellar shells on core - collapse sn lightcurves , with the primary motivation of trying to understand the power source of extremely luminous type  iin events and their relation to the diverse population of sne  iin .",
    "we show how these circumstellar shells can indeed create extreme peaks in the luminosity such as have been observed in type  iin supernovae like sn2006gy and sn2006tf .",
    "the luminosity of these sne would require extreme amounts of @xmath3ni if they are powered by radioactive decay , but if interactions in the csm provide the power instead , then the shell masses and speeds that are required have reasonable precedent from observed properties of spatially resolved shells around nearby massive stars ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our investigation is by no means exhaustive .",
    "pre - sn circumstellar shells may have a wide range of masses , expansion speeds , and radii , whereas we have adopted simplified shell geometries for illustrative examples .",
    "additionally , the underlying sne ejecta may have wide diversity in explosion energy , mass , and ejecta speed . in this preliminary investigation ,",
    "our approach has been to vary each of these parameters individually to illustrate their influence on the light curve rather than attempting to accurately model any individual sn .",
    "we have attempted to find general ways to distinguish between different kinds of shells , using trends in the observed shapes of the lightcurves , their characteristic emission temperature , and observed shock speeds .",
    "we find that observations of the evolution of the shock speed is necessary to help break the degeneracy in the other free parameters , while observations of the speed of the pre - shock csm help considerably as well ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this can be used to analyze the mass - loss history of massive stars in the last years prior to the explosion , which can be a powerful tool for studying the final stages of stellar evolution .",
    "ultimately , we wish to know the physical origin of these sn - precursor events .",
    "the key result is that we confirm the large masses of circumstellar shells hypothesized to account for some recent luminous sne  iin @xcite , as well as the high mass and explosion energy of the underlying sne .",
    "one can also produce a very high peak luminosity with lower mass if the shell is slow and the sn ejecta are fast , but a lower mass shell can not yield both a high peak luminosity and a long duration of @xmath114100 days seen in some luminous sne  iin .",
    "in fact , we suspect that even larger shell masses or larger explosion energies are needed to account for the observed light curves of the most luminous sne  iin .",
    "thus , more detailed attempts to model individual objects will be the focus of a second paper in this series .",
    "further research is required for quantitative analyses of observed sn  iin lightcurves and to extract reliable absolute values of shell masses and sn explosion energies .",
    "this must include adding the luminosity contribution from the underlying sn photosphere ( powered by diffusion or radioactive decay ) in cases where the csm interaction luminosity is not extremely high compared to the ejecta photosphere , as well as using an improved treatment of post - shock cooling and radiative transfer at high optical depths in order to more accurately model the emergent radiation from the post - shock shells in these simulations . as noted by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "it is likely that the csm will be highly opaque , especially at the earliest phases , so the effects of radiative diffusion should be taken into account to properly model the emergent luminosity .",
    "finally , all our simulations have adopted a type ii - p core - collapse sn density profile , but other types of sne with different density profiles need to be investigated in a similar manner , since any type of sn can , in principle , be a type  iin event if it runs into a dense h - rich environment .",

    "<S> recent observations of luminous type iin supernovae ( sne ) provide compelling evidence that massive circumstellar shells surround their progenitors . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how the properties of such shells influence the sn lightcurve by conducting numerical simulations of the interaction between an expanding sn and a circumstellar shell ejected a few years prior to core collapse . </S>",
    "<S> our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a range of circumstellar shell masses , velocities , geometries , and wind mass - loss rates , as well as variations in the sn mass and energy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the shell mass is the most important parameter , in the sense that higher shell masses ( or higher ratios of m@xmath0/m@xmath1 ) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher efficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light . </S>",
    "<S> lower mass shells can also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the sn ejecta are very fast , but only for a short time . sustaining a high luminosity for durations of more than 100 d </S>",
    "<S> requires massive circumstellar shells of order 10  @xmath2 or more . </S>",
    "<S> this reaffirms previous comparisons between pre - sn shells and shells produced by giant eruptions of luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , although the physical mechanism responsible for these outbursts remains uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> the lightcurve shape and observed shell velocity can help diagnose the approximate size and density of the circumstellar shell , and it may be possible to distinguish between spherical and bipolar shells with multiwavelength lightcurves . </S>",
    "<S> these models are merely illustrative . </S>",
    "<S> one can , of course , achieve even higher luminosities and longer duration light curves from interaction by increasing the explosion energy and shell mass beyond values adopted here .    </S>",
