    "reconnection is often associated with flaring events , for example in solar flares and in transients of grbs ( flaring / sub - bursts ) .    streaming instabilities , including the filamentation instability ( fi ) ,",

    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) models are naturally suited for this task , since radiation spectra may be synthesized directly from such simulations by simply integrating the expression for the radiated power , derived from the linard - wiechert potentials for a large number of representative particles in the pic representation of the plasma  @xcite .",
    "shock plasma conditions develop through several stages , from two - stream non - thermal to almost isotropically thermal .",
    "all radiative stages of the relevant instabilities should be probed when modeling optically thin emission spectra from highly transient phenomena . here",
    "we exemplify one such transition , passing through several radiative stages of the fi , with a pic simulations of a spatially periodic and initially unmagnetized two - stream system .",
    "we emphasize the exploratory nature of this setup , which provides a well defined and reproducible model setup where such a transition occurs selfconsistently .",
    "we make no claim that there is a one - to - one mapping of spatial features and time scales to real phenomena .",
    "section 2 outlines our synthesis method and pic simulations while section 3 is dedicated to results .",
    "discussions and conclusions are found in section 4 .",
    "the relativistic filamentation instability is set up by preparing two equal density neutral plasma beams ( fig .  [",
    "fig : figure1final ] ) , under fully periodic boundary conditions .",
    "beams were chosen with bulk flows of @xmath0 $ ] ( @xmath1 $ ] ) for 3 ( 2 ) spatial components and 3 ( 2 ) velocity components , or 3d3v ( 2d2v ) runs .",
    "simulation volumes were @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , respectively .",
    "plasma densities were adjusted such that all simulations contained an equal number of relativistic electron skindepths , @xmath4 , independent of @xmath5 , with @xmath6^{1/2}$ ] the relativistic plasma frequency .",
    "we simulated both baryonic ( @xmath7 ) and pair ( @xmath8 ) plasmas .",
    "a reduced mass ratio was used for the baryonic case ; @xmath9 suffices in separating ion and electron dynamic time scales .",
    "in addition , a subset of the radiation spectra were collected in static ( frozen ) em fields , starting from a well developed time in the simulation , rather than in _ in situ _ full electromagnetic dynamics .",
    "these frozen test runs are analyzed and discussed by  @xcite . in summary",
    "they conclude that , unlike realistic synthetic spectra collected _ in situ _ , spectra obtained in static ( yet self - consistent ) fields are well ( but erroneously ) interpreted by a synchrotron template .",
    "this , along with the obvious advantage of computational speed and ease was a main motivation for employing a completely self - consistent _ in situ _ synthesis approach .",
    "we chose the often employed pic scaling of natural constants , setting @xmath10 . varying @xmath11 ( number or charge density ) ensured an equal number of skindepths for all @xmath12 for reasons of comparison .",
    "time is henceforth normalized to @xmath13 .",
    "all results were obtained using a 6@xmath14 order field solver for maxwell s equations .",
    "the field spectra were only affected qualitatively at high wavenumber ( i.e. in the extreme dissipative range ) .",
    "spectral synthesis was verified to exhibit negligible dependence of field solver order .",
    "we used cubic ( quadratic ) spline interpolation between particles and the field grid in 3d ( 2d ) .",
    "we incorporate into the photonplasma pic code , developed in copenhagen  @xcite , a discretized version of the standard expression for radiated power from accelerated charges @xmath15 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . using the aforementioned pic scaling , synthetic radiation frequencies are normalized to @xmath16 .",
    "spectra are collected at runtime , and for simulations using @xmath17 particles , we collect spectra from @xmath18 particles without noticeable slow - down in simulation speed .",
    "we retain all phase and temporal information of the ensemble signal by integrating the signal as : @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "spectra are recorded every small multiple of a simulation timestep .",
    "thus , we may extract instantaneous spectral states as @xmath21 .",
    "we can specify multiple ( far - field ) observers at arbitrary orientation , and we can choose multiple regions for spectral collection in the simulation volume .",
    "in practice , we have a choice of selecting phase coherent or phase incoherent spectral synthesis .",
    "binning over frequency spectral range was chosen to be logarithmic in @xmath22 , but can in general be either logarithmic or linear in @xmath22 ; linear frequency binning is used primarily for test purposes .",

    "temporal evolution of @xmath40 is modest  see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1final ] ( right panel ) .",
    "particle pdfs are well represented by two shifted gaussians in the streaming direction and a single gaussian perpendicular to the streaming direction , @xmath41 .",
    "the average lorentz factor of the streaming particles decrease in the simulation ( lab ) frame during the fi .",
    "temperatures increase with @xmath42 for early times and @xmath43 in the late phase .",
    "once the fi has burned all its momentum anisotropy , the total electron ensemble has @xmath44 ( no bulk flow ) .",
    "non - isotropic momentum distributions naturally result from non - isotropic particle acceleration ; we expect this to be the case based on our devised toy model of `` non - fermi '' acceleration ,  @xcite .",
    "we therefore proceeded to compare subsets of the total particle ensemble , in momentum space , specified by the criteria : @xmath45 effectively selecting particles with momenta confined inside a narrow pitch cone of opening angle @xmath46 , at varying inclination , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , w.r.t . the streaming direction .",
    "thus , electrons are selected which are significantly beaming their radiative contribution in the direction of the cone ; they radiate efficiently for certain observer orientations , @xmath49 .",
    "figure [ fig : anisotrop_accel ] ( insets 1 & 2 ) show how , early during the fi , electrons experience a _ non - isotropic acceleration _ , with directional preference towards forward beaming of @xmath50 .",
    "this beamed acceleration continues to drive a small part of the total particle ensemble to high gamma factors ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "later , as @xmath5 decreases ( bi - directionally ) , this anisotropy spreads to include also higher inclination angles ( inset 3 )",
    ". this could be either due to early preference - accelerated electrons diffusing out of their streaming directed pitch cone ( inset 1@xmath52inset 4 ) , or due to current filaments going unstable and acquiring a cross - stream component ( i.e. they start bending ) , or both .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d6gfig3_ions_int2 ] reveals consistently higher peak frequencies , @xmath53 , for increasing observer angles _ up to a maximum angle _ @xmath54 . for higher angles",
    "@xmath53 stays approximately constant up to @xmath55 . even at late times ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3d6gfig3_ions_int2 ] , lower panel ) peak frequencies @xmath53 are observer dependent , and apparently _ increase _ with streaming axis inclination angle . still , even though @xmath56 increases relative to the head - on ( @xmath57 ) observer at a given time , it never exceeds the initial head - on maximum peak frequency , @xmath58 , in 3d .    in the 2d case viewed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d6gfig3_ions_early_alt1_noisecorr ] the peak frequency increases for all observers during the fi , and @xmath59 for all cases ( open circles of both fig .  [ fig:3d6gfig3_ions_int2 ] and fig .  [ fig:2d6gfig3_ions_early_alt1_noisecorr ] ) .",
    "this effect is an artifact of the lower - dimensional 2d model ; particles experience more frequent interactions with the ion filaments , since the `` filament hit probability '' is considerably smaller in 3d due to the reduction in filament filling factor ( filaments are actually sheets in 2d , whereas they are true line - like filaments in 3d ) .",
    "radiation spectra are therefore formed more rapidly by the plasma field structures and with better statistics in 2d  albeit artifactually so .",
    "fitting the semi - analytical result for jitter radiation @xcite to 3d spectra ( figure [ fig:3d6gfig1 ] , upper panel ) shows markedly better fits than a synchrotron spectrum for the same parameters , during early stage fi , both for baryonic plasmas and pair plasmas . at later stages , also",
    "models of synchrotron fit the spectra well , but we emphasize previous findings , that the underlying plasma dynamics is not synchrotron in origin  @xcite . for a spectrum ( and evolution ) which has been isotropically averaged over all observer directions  figure [ fig:3d6gfig1 ] , lower panel  making the same qualitative scaled fits of the semi - analytic model produces better agreement if a jitter radiation environment is assumed . such an averaged spectrum can be seen as the immediate spectral state in the bulk of the plasma two - stream ( or locally in a shock ) , when the simulation frame coincides with the co - moving frame of the plasma , as is the case in the fi setup presented here .",
    "our result further agrees quite precisely with the scaling relation of peak frequencies for a semi - analytical jitter radiation model , reported in  @xcite . at early times , we have measured @xmath60 , while at late times @xmath61 joint by a smooth transition .",
    "a by - eye re - alignment fit ( thick grey line , fig .",
    "[ fig:2d6gfig3_ions_early_alt1_noisecorr ] ) of the same semi - analytic result to the 2d baryonic case shows an under - estimate of high frequency radiated power .",
    "this undershoot artifact is not seen in 3d ( upper green , solid , curve , fig .",
    "[ fig:3d6gfig1 ] ) .",
    "it , too , is probably a consequence of the reduced dimensionality , again by the above argument concerning 2d result artifacts .",
    "moreover , in 2d , the maximum value corresponding to the abscissae of fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotrop_accel ] , @xmath62 , is @xmath63 which is higher by a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "this further influences late time spectra ( lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:3d6gfig3_ions_int2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3d6gfig1 ] ) .",
    "the 2d and 3d cases exhibit gross discrepancy in peak frequencies ; they differ by an order of magnitude ( @xmath65 ) , due to a general upward drift of @xmath53 in 2d . again",
    ", 2d spectra are pushed to higher frequencies , likely due to an enhanced filament hit probability. the 2d results for @xmath66-plasmas exhibit analogous features .",
    "the context of the current investigation is to compare the jitter and synchrotron radiation approaches to radiation spectra modeling in a simple but well defined and reproducible setup .",
    "the more general problem of synthesizing the radiation field from fully developed collisionless shocks , with a firm tuning of parameters , is the subject of future studies .",
    "here we have produced synthesized radiation spectra for multiple observer orientations from 2d and 3d particle - in - cell simulations of the relativistic filamentation instability in a periodic box , relevant to relativistic collisionless shocks such as believed at work in for example gamma - ray bursts , and in transient shocks at reconnection sites .",
    "we investigated radiation spectral evolution for both pair plasmas ( @xmath67 ) and baryon loaded ( @xmath27 ) plasmas , for a broad range of bulk flow speeds .",
    "* at early times , @xmath60 , which fits a semi - analytical jitter radiation model  @xcite .",
    "later @xmath61 , with a smooth transition between the two regimes .",
    "we emphasize that this scaling is not synchrotron in origin .",
    "+ it may be difficult to extract such scaling - laws directly from existing observations .",
    "however , the result is still quite relevant : through a shock interface , the bulk lorentz factor and spectral parameters vary drastically . in employing semi - analytical models based on synchrotron modeling , inference of a most likely physical scenario",
    "might fall short , yielding incorrect scalings of frequencies and flux .",
    "* non - isotropic acceleration occurs during both linear and early non - linear fi , and is present in both baryonic and pair plasmas . for pairs",
    "the process progresses much faster , and non - isotropic acceleration is negligible .",
    "the findings are commensurate with previous findings on direct non - fermi particle acceleration  @xcite in non - linearly developed @xmath27 ( i.e. inert ) filaments  @xcite .",
    "* synthetic spectra generated from 2d pic simulations exhibit an upward drift of @xmath68 which is not seen in 3d  cf .",

    "* further , generally , 2d spectra differ qualitatively and quantitatively from 3d spectra in both @xmath53 , @xmath69 and in spectral slopes , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) at low ( high ) frequency  see fig .",
    "[ fig:3d6gfig3_ions_int2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3d6gfig1 ] .",
    "we find that lower - dimensional models ( such as for example 2d2v or 2d3v ) provide distorted measurements of parameters central to radiation modeling .",
    "peak frequencies are generally too high , and low- ( high- ) frequency spectral slopes , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , are too steep ( flat ) compared with spectra obtained from 3d modeling .",
    "we expect that 2d3v ( 2d spatial dimensions , 3d particle velocity components ) simulations will display properties intermediate of 2d2v and 3d3v .",
    "while obtaining synthetic spectra from both pair plasmas ( @xmath66 ) and baryonic plasmas ( @xmath27 ) , we establish that spectra are qualitatively dependent on the plasma constituent species .",
    "this difference must be addressed when interpreting astrophysical observed spectra .",
    "we interpret the radiation spectra differences between baryon and pair plasma cases as a direct signature of screened current channel formation in the non - linear stage of the fi .",
    "the presence of non - isotropically distributed electrons , accelerated preferentially in the streaming direction , could lead to spectra that peak at higher frequency than would be estimated from the _ isotropic _ ( thermal + powerlaw ) particle ensemble . since they are powerlaw distributed ( left panel , fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotrop_accel ] ) their contribution should also be powerlaw by origin . although non - isotropic acceleration is also present in @xmath72-plasmas it is negligible on long timescales , due to the lack of an inert plasma species .",
    "we conjecture that baryonic plasmas could therefore yield radiation signatures with harder powerlaw behavior at high - frequency ( @xmath73 ) , but softer spectral slope at low frequency ( @xmath74 ) . the electrostatic field ,",
    "although screened , also plays a significant role for spectrum of emitted radiation . in the up - stream region ahead of the shock , where streaming instabilities are of early stage type , screened electrostatic effects are likely to produce heavily observer dependent effects . for global shock simulations with non - periodic boundary conditions such a non - isotropic acceleration mechanism will be sustained .",
    "our results establish tractability of an alternative approach to radiation modeling  the jitter radiation approach .",
    "it contrasts the standard synchrotron approach ; assuming a pure synchrotron mechanism in observed relativistic streaming phenomena , we would infer  incorrectly  that large scale homogenous magnetic fields were present , when rather it might be small scale fields , in ( a priori ) non - magnetized relativistic shocked outflows .    a tight correspondence exists between on one hand the spectral evolution of radiation emitted from electrons in optically thin collisionless plasmas and , on the other , the field spectral evolution in the plasma due to the instabilities that create and mediate such radiation .",
    "care should be exhibited with reduced dimensionality modeling ; as 3d models become increasingly affordable they are to be preferred over 2d models , as spectral diagnostics can be distorted as a consequence of reduced dimensionality  filament entanglement is for example only possible in 3d .",
    "attention should also be given to choices of plasma constituents ( electrons , protons , ions , etc . ) .",
    "to conclude , the radiation spectral modeling results presented here reveal limitations that need to be considered while reverse engineering spectra observed from , for example , relativistic astrophysical outflows , grbs , relativistic reconnection sites , and from laser - plasma interaction in laboratory astrophysics , when examining likely physical scenarios for their match to observed spectra .",
