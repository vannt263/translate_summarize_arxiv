    "very recently , belle collaboration observed two narrow structures @xmath0 and @xmath3 in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mass spectra that are produced in association with a single charged pion in @xmath6 decays @xcite .",
    "the measured masses of the two structures are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "experimental analysis favors quantum numbers of @xmath9 for both states . as @xmath0 and @xmath3",
    "are charged , they can not be simple @xmath10 combinations .",
    "the measured masses of these two new states exceed by only a few @xmath11 the thresholds for the open beauty channels @xmath1 and @xmath12 . they could be interpreted as molecular states and determined by the strong interaction dynamics of @xmath1 and @xmath12 meson pairs @xcite .",
    "the concepts of molecular states were put forward long ago in @xcite . some of the exotic x , y , and z resonances have been described as possible charmonium - like molecular candidates in the literatures since their masses are very close to the meson - meson thresholds .",
    "explicitly , it is interpreted @xmath13 as a @xmath14 molecular state @xcite , @xmath15 as a @xmath16 molecular state @xcite , @xmath17 as a @xmath18 molecular state @xcite , @xmath19 as a @xmath20 @xcite or an @xmath21 molecular state @xcite , @xmath22 as a @xmath23 molecular state @xcite , @xmath24 as a @xmath25 molecular state @xcite etc .. if molecular states can be confirmed , qcd will be further testified and then one will understand qcd low - energy behaviors more deeply .    the newly observed @xmath26 resonances may open a new window to study molecular states in the bottomonium - like family .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate whether they could be bottomonium - like molecular candidates .",
    "the quantitative description of their properties like masses are helpful for understanding their structures .",
    "unfortunately , quarks are confined inside hadrons in the real world , and the strong interaction dynamics of these states are governed by nonperturbative qcd effect completely . in this work , by assuming @xmath0 as a @xmath1 molecular state , we calculate the mass of this resonance in the framework of qcd sum rule ( qcdsr ) method @xcite , which is a nonperturbative formulation firmly rooted in qcd basic theory and has been used to study some charmonium - like molecular states @xcite .",
    "it is not so straightforward from the meson - meson configuration of fields to construct a @xmath12 current with a quantum number of @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath3 will not be discussed here .",
    "our final numerical result @xmath2 for @xmath1 agrees well with the experimental data of @xmath0 , while the masses of the @xmath27 @xmath28 tetraquark states were found to be around @xmath29 in qcdsr @xcite , which are lower than the measured values of @xmath26 states .",
    "the present work thus favors that the @xmath0 resonance could be a @xmath1 molecular state rather than a @xmath28 tetraquark state .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as three parts .",
    "we discuss qcd sum rules for the molecular state in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , where the phenomenological representation and the operator product expansion ( ope ) contribution up to dimension six operators for the two - point correlator are derived .",
    "the numerical analysis is made in sec .",
    "the mass of the @xmath1 molecular state is extracted out and found to coincide with the experimental value of @xmath0 resonance . the sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] is a short summary and outlook .",
    "the starting point of the qcd sum rule method is to construct the interpolating current properly and then write down the correlator ( for reviews see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the molecular state currents are built up with the color - singlet currents for their composed hadrons .",
    "as for @xmath1 , the current is constructed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 indicates the light quark and the subscript @xmath32 and @xmath33 are color indices .",
    "note that the current is local and the four field operators act at the same space - time point .",
    "it is a limitation inherent in the qcdsr disposal of the hadrons since the bound states are not point particles in a rigorous manner .",
    "the current is different from that of tetraquark state which is diquark - antidiquark configuration of fields .",
    "these two types of currents can be related to each other by fiertz rearrangement and differ by color and dirac factors @xcite .",
    "it will have a maximum overlap for the molecular state with the meson - meson type current .",
    "the masses of the @xmath28 tetraquark states were calculated in qcdsr and found to be around @xmath29 in @xcite , and @xmath34 in @xcite .",
    "both of the predicted values for tetraquark states are lower than the @xmath35 mass .",
    "therefore , it s hard to accommodate @xmath26 as tetraquark states .",

    "in this section , the eq.([sum rule 2 ] ) will be numerically analyzed .",
    "the @xmath67 quark mass is taken as @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "the condensates are @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 @xcite . in the qcdsr approach",
    ", there is approximation in the ope of the correlation function , and there is a very complicated and largely unknown structure of the hadronic dispersion integral in the phenomenological side .",
    "therefore , the match of the two sides is not independent of @xmath74 .",
    "one expects that there exists a range of @xmath74 , in which the two sides have a good overlap and the sum rule can work well . in practice ,",
    "one can analyse the convergence in the ope side and the pole contribution dominance in the phenomenological side to determine the allowed borel window : on one hand , the lower constraint for @xmath74 is obtained by the consideration that the perturbative contributions should be larger than the condensate contributions , so that the convergence of the ope is under control and the higher dimension terms can be safely ignored ; on the other hand , the upper limit for @xmath74 is obtained by the restriction that the pole contributions should be larger than the continuum state contributions , so as to guarantee that the contributions from high resonance states and continuum states remains a small part in the phenomenological side . meanwhile , the threshold parameter @xmath75 is not completely arbitrary but characterizes the beginning of the continuum states .",
    "the energy gap between the groundstate and the first excitation is around @xmath76 in many cases of nucleons or charmonium - like states . whereas , this may not be always straightforwardly generalized to the bottomonium - like states since their absolute masses are much larger than masses of nucleons or charmonium - like states .",
    "one should consider whether there is a proper region of borel parameter @xmath74 for a fixing @xmath75 , or whether one could find a working window for the sum rule . on all accounts",
    ", it is expected that the two sides have a good overlap in the determined work window and information on the resonance can be safely extracted .",
    "firstly , we take the factorization hypothesis of the four - quark condensate @xmath77 with @xmath78 . the comparison between pole and continuum contributions of sum rule ( [ sr2 ] ) as a function of the borel parameter @xmath48 for the threshold value @xmath79 is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "its ope convergence by comparing the perturbative , quark condensate , four - quark condensate , mixed condensate , two - gluon condensate , and three - gluon condensate contributions as a function of @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "the ratio of perturbative contributions to the total ope contributions at @xmath80 is nearly @xmath81 and it increases with @xmath74 .",
    "thus the perturbative contributions will dominate in the total ope contributions when @xmath82 .",
    "on the other hand , the relative pole contribution is approximate to @xmath83 at @xmath84 and it decreases with @xmath74 . in order to guarantee that the pole contribution can dominate in the total contributions , we have the value @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the range of @xmath74 for @xmath1 is taken as @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "similarly , the proper range of @xmath74 is @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "we see that the corresponding borel parameter range is @xmath92 for @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for @xmath95 , which are very narrow as working windows .",
    "therefore , the threshold parameter @xmath75 is taken as @xmath96 .",
    "the mass of @xmath1 is numerically calculated to be @xmath97 and shown in fig .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath43 between current and the particle is calculated from eq.([sr2 ] ) in the same working windows .",
    "we arrive at @xmath98 .",
    "the equivalent quantity of the tetraquark current is @xmath99 in @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath43 is roughly three times as large as the one of the tetraquark current and the meson - meson molecular current has a larger overlap with the @xmath26 state in comparison to the diquark - antidiquark tetraquark current .    to investigate the effect of the factorization breaking , we assume that @xmath77 with @xmath100 . from the similar analysis process",
    ", the corresponding working windows are taken as : @xmath101 for @xmath89 , @xmath102 for @xmath87 , and @xmath103 for @xmath91 .",
    "we extract the mass value @xmath104 . finally , we average two results for @xmath105 and arrive at the mass value @xmath2 for @xmath1 , which agrees with the experimental value @xmath7 for @xmath0 .",

    "by assuming @xmath0 as a @xmath1 molecular state , the qcd sum rule method has been applied to calculate the mass of the resonance .",
    "our numerical result is @xmath2 for @xmath1 .",
    "it is compatible with the newly measured experimental data of @xmath0 by belle collaboration , which supports the statement that @xmath0 resonance could be a @xmath1 molecular state .",
