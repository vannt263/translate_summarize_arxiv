    "a sizable value of the residual electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath8 , amounting to @xmath15 near optimum doping , growing to @xmath16 with doping , shows that a considerable part of the fermi surface is ungapped or presents broad deep minima .",
    "the remaining superconducting specific heat is fitted to a two - band @xmath2-model , which is found to represent the experimental data well .",

    "this term is due to the presence of non - superconducting quasiparticles .",
    "since the crystals are nicely shaped with freshly cleaved surfaces , macroscopic secondary phases are unlikely to be the cause of this high @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we believe that the residual term is due to a part of the fermi surface being ungapped or presenting deep broad minima in the order parameter suppressed by weak disorder . values of @xmath39 in the range of @xmath40 have been reported for co - doped samples close to optimal doping @xcite ( @xmath41 at optimal doping ) , much higher than for k - doped samples , where @xmath39 accounts to only a few percent @xcite .",

    "the exponent is in the range of @xmath109 to @xmath110 for all three samples .",
    "previous measurements at optimal doping @xcite show as well a very similar field dependence for fields up to 4 t , while a crossover to a linear behavior is found at higher fields .",
    "this behavior is interpreted in terms of a double gap system , in which the volovik - like trend at low fields is due to a strongly anisotropic gap , while the linear component at high fields is due to a second isotropic gap . even if we see no sign of a second gap from the temperature dependence of the specific heat of the @xmath23 sample as shown in fig .",
    "[ figalphamodel](a ) , such a gap should be expected in order to explain the field dependence of @xmath111 .",
    "its weight is however at most about 5% , given by the uncertainty of the fitting parameters .",
    "the exponent @xmath10 displays no clear trend with doping .",
    "this shows that , despite different weights of the gaps along the doping range , the total degree of anisotropy , as measured by the field dependence of @xmath111 , stays constant .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the theory of bang @xcite , which shows that for a two - band @xmath112 state in the presence of impurity scattering the field dependence of @xmath111 mainly depends on the ratio between the two gap amplitudes @xmath113 and not on their weights .",
    "in conclusion , from high - resolution specific heat measurements on overdoped @xmath18 single - crystals we observe : ( i ) a sizable residual term @xmath8 at all dopings , sign of a considerable part of the fermi surface presenting no superconducting gap or very deep minima .",

    "<S> we report on specific heat measurements on clean overdoped @xmath0 single crystals performed with a high resolution membrane - based nanocalorimeter . </S>",
    "<S> a nonzero residual electronic specific heat coefficient at zero temperature @xmath1 is seen for all doping compositions , indicating a considerable fraction of the fermi surface ungapped or having very deep minima . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining superconducting electronic specific heat is analyzed through a two - band s - wave @xmath2 model in order to investigate the gap structure . </S>",
    "<S> close to optimal doping we detect a single zero - temperature gap of @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath4 . increasing the phosphorus concentration @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , the main gap reduces till a value of @xmath6 for @xmath7 and a second weaker gap becomes evident . from the magnetic field effect on @xmath8 , all samples however show similar behavior [ @xmath9 , with @xmath10 between 0.6 and 0.7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that , despite a considerable redistribution of the gap weights , the total degree of gap anisotropy does not change drastically with doping . </S>"
