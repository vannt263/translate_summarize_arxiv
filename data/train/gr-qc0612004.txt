    "in the present work we return to the study of an old subject@xcite , namely properties of asymptotically flat einstein space - times , both vacuum and with a maxwell field . more specifically we explore some previously overlooked properties of such space - times .",
    "the point of view is however rather new .",
    "the basic idea is that for each asymptotically flat vacuum solution there is a certain ` structure ' , a unique function on null infinity , @xmath1 that has been known in various contexts , but whose several unusual properties have largely been overlooked .",
    "this function , which we shall refer to as the universal cut function ( ucf ) , carries virtually all the asymptotic information , as well as much of the physical content of its associated solution .",
    "in addition , it unifies several apparently disparate ideas . in the case of the einstein - maxwell fields ,",
    "in general there are two such functions , one for gr and one for the maxwell field - however we will consider only the degenerate case where the two function are the same .",
    "we begin with the conventional view of @xmath2 it is a three - dimensional manifold , @xmath3x@xmath4 coordinatized by the standard bondi coordinates @xmath5,@xmath6 ) , with complex stereographic coordinates ( @xmath6 ) on the @xmath3 and @xmath7 on the @xmath8 part .",
    "( the subscript ` @xmath9 ' denotes the retarded time . ) we part from the conventional point of view by allowing the complexification of @xmath10 i.e. , we consider @xmath11 with @xmath7 now allowed to take complex values close to the real and ( @xmath6 ) going to ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 close to @xmath14 it should be emphasized that this complexification of @xmath15 is a formal device that has many interesting consequences .",
    "nevertheless we are dealing with real space - times and real solutions to the einstein equations .",
    "a significant notational problem should be addressed now .",
    "the time variable @xmath16 used above is , in flat space the _ retarded _ time @xmath17 many years ago@xcite , in order to keep the symmetry of many of the equations in the spin - coefficient formalism this @xmath7 was replaced by @xmath18 via @xmath19 later to see the physical consequences of our results we restore the retarded time @xmath7 and , in addition , explicitly display the velocity of light , @xmath20    in sec .",
    "ii we review some background material .",
    "much of it , though in the literature , is still quite unfamiliar to most readers . to help overcome this unfamiliarity",
    ", we present in sec .",
    "iii a detailed discussion , in the simplified case of flat space - times@xmath21 of the ideas to be used later in the asymptotically flat cases .",
    "iv is devoted to a discussion of these ideas for general asymptotically flat space - times while sec .",
    "v is used to specialize the discussion to the algebraically special type ii einstein - maxwell metrics . in sec .",
    "v and the remaining sections , we first see how the new ideas interact with the classical bondi energy - momentum four - vector , giving it new properties and even fresh predictions .",
    "then we see how it interacts with the bondi energy - momentum loss equation , giving it surprising new interpretations that include equations of motion for the center of mass motion , even containing radiation reaction forces .",
    "it even strongly suggests a general relativistic definition of spin - angular momentum . finally in sec .",
    "viii , the conclusion , we discuss how in principle one could try to observe the predictions described earlier .",
    "the ucf , which had been introduced earlier in different contexts@xcite , is described as follows : it is to be a one - complex parameter family of ` cuts ' - complex 2-surfaces - of @xmath11 written as @xmath22 with ( in general ) a complex @xmath23 parametrizing the family .",
    "[ in important special cases , we could have a _",
    "real _ one parameter family of real cuts of @xmath1 so that @xmath24 was a real function of a real @xmath25 in fact , in this case , eq.([x ] ) could be treated as a coordinate transformation from @xmath26 to @xmath25 the real coordinates ( @xmath27 have been referred to nu coordinates .",
    "] we also assume that eq.([x ] ) can be inverted , i.e. , solved for @xmath28 for real @xmath26 and @xmath29 this obviously defines a complex @xmath23 such that the @xmath26 in eq.([x ] ) is real .",
    "\\{aside : later we will see that @xmath30 for real @xmath26 and @xmath31 is a cr function for a cr structure obtained from @xmath32 }    from @xmath33 we define two functions , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( that have been extensively used in gr in different contexts , with different coordinate systems@xcite , by @xmath36 with @xmath37 meaning the edth operator with @xmath23 held constant . here",
    ", these functions have a common origin in the ucf .",
    "an important point is that , in both @xmath34 and @xmath38 the @xmath23 could be eliminated via eq.([t ] ) and they could be treated as functions on the real @xmath39 both have simple geometric meanings : @xmath40 is the ` @xmath26 ' separation between neighboring constant @xmath23 cuts while @xmath41 is a stereographic ` angle ' field on real @xmath42 on the sphere of past null directions , that determines the directions of an asymptotically shear - free null geodesic congruence going into the interior .    in the case of algebraically special type ii space - times , @xmath43 is the basic variable in the robinson - trautman metrics@xcite with real @xmath44 while @xmath45 is the basic variable for the twisting type ii metrics .",
    "* note that we use @xmath46 and @xmath47    of primary importance to us is the fact that @xmath48 and hence @xmath49 and @xmath34 are uniquely determined ( up to gauge transformations - bms transformations ) in any given ( non - flat ) asymptotically flat space - time .",
    "they are determined by the appropriate choice of a _ shear - free _ ( for flat or algebraically special space - times ) or an _ asymptotically shear - free _ ( for asymptotically flat space - time ) _ null geodesic congruence .",

    "an alternate and easier method to find @xmath48 and @xmath49 , is to immediately use the variables ( @xmath58 and solve the equation @xmath59 for @xmath60 and then find @xmath61 by @xmath62 noticing that @xmath63    these results follow by implicit differentiation of eq.([x ] ) using eq.([ethl ] ) . in the flat space case",
    "there is considerable freedom in the choice of solution for @xmath48 and @xmath49 that is considerably narrowed by the requirement of regularity of the function @xmath49 on @xmath64 the geometric meaning of ` regularity ' is that all the null geodesics are transverse to @xmath42 i.e. none of the geodesics lie on @xmath39 the final freedom , which follows from eq.([eth^2x ] ) , is that of a free complex analytic word - line in complex minkowski space .",

    "we have :    _ every transverse ( regular ) shear free or asymptotically shear - free null geodesic congruence in an asymptotically flat space - time is generated by a complex world - line in h - space .",
    "_    finally an algebraic condition on the weyl tensor components determines@xcite a _ unique _ complex world - line and thus yields the ucf .",
    "one knows from electrodynamics that many properties of the sources ( charge and current distributions ) of an asymptotically vanishing electromagnetic radiation field can be determined or at least studied from the asymptotic field itself , e.g. the total charge and both the electric and magnetic multipole moments . in gr one tries to do a similar thing .",
    "for example we have the bondi energy - momentum defined from certain asymptotic weyl tensor components and many attempts to define multipole moments and angular momentum from other weyl tensor components and the asymptotic shear .",
    "our contention is that , aside from the energy - momentum four - vector , many or most of the asymptotically obtained physical quantities are hidden in the ucf . and even the properties and description of the energy - momentum four - vector is greatly clarified by the ucf . in order to extract this information from the ucf , using its assumed regularity ,",
    "we expand it in spherical harmonics , writing it as @xmath79 or , using the spherical tensor harmonics@xcite as , @xmath80 where the components @xmath81 or the ( @xmath82 ) are , in general , complex functions of a complex time @xmath44 and are to be given physical meaning .",

    "the four components of ( @xmath84)@xmath85(@xmath86 are to be identified with a complex position vector , the real part with the center of mass , and the imaginary part with spin - angular momentum / unit mass . the complex @xmath87 are associated with mass and spin - quadrupole moments while the higher harmonic terms are related to the higher moments , the real parts to the mass moments and the imaginary parts to the spin - moments .",
    "in addition to its role as describing physical quantities , the ucf has a pretty geometric / group theoretical meaning .",
    "one knows from bondi s and penrose s early work concerning the asymptotic symmetries@xcite that the freedom in the choice of the bondi coordinate system is what is known as the bms group .",
    "in addition to the rotation subgroup it contains the supertranslation subgroup acting on @xmath88 and given by @xmath89 which can be extended into the complex by @xmath90 the function @xmath91 which can be expanded in spherical harmonics , contains the ( complex ) poincar translation subgroup defined by the expansion in only the @xmath92 and @xmath93 harmonics , @xmath94 if we choose the starting value @xmath95 and consider a one parameter family of supertranslations , @xmath96 we can consider the ucf as a one complex parameter family of supertranslations and the @xmath92 and @xmath93 part as a one - parameter family of complex poincar transformations .    in other words ,",
    "the complex four - vector world - line @xmath97 can be interpreted as a world - line in the ( complex ) poincar translation subgroup .",
    "we can chose @xmath23 so that the velocity vector of the world - line has a lorentzian norm of one .",
    "\\{an alternative interpretation is to take the world - line in h - space and use the h - space norm . }",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "iii , the application of the ucf to minkowski space is described and the two different flat space forms of the metric , those associated with @xmath98 and with @xmath99 are worked out . in sec .",
    "iv we give a brief outline how the ucf is used in general asymptotically flat space - times while in secs .",
    "vii we apply these idea to the algebraically special type ii metrics .",
    "viii is devoted to a discussion .",
    "since many of the ideas developed here are unfamiliar to large portions of the relativity community we believed it would be of value to first describe them in the simpler context of flat space - time where the functions @xmath49 and @xmath100 have made frequent earlier appearances@xcite and have relatively simple meaning .",
    "the basic idea here is to first describe arbitrary shear - free null geodesic congruences in flat space and then to specialize them to the case of regular congruences , i.e. , congruences that are completely transverse to @xmath101 in general these congruences have twist and the basic variable of choice is the @xmath49 .",
    "twist - free congruences are more easily treated with the variable @xmath34 .",
    "the main distinction between the flat space and the asymptotically flat space properties of @xmath49 and @xmath34 is that in the spherical harmonic expansions only the lowest harmonics , i.e. , @xmath92 and @xmath102 appear in the flat space while all harmonics can appear for the curved space .",
    "we begin by giving an analytic description of any arbitrary null geodesic congruence , ( with @xmath103 as tangent vector ) , in minkowski space@xcite . using @xmath104 as standard minkowski - space coordinates ,",
    "@xmath105 an arbitrary complex function of the parameters ( @xmath106 ) which label individual members of the null geodesic congruence and @xmath9 as the affine parameter along each null geodesic , we find that @xmath107 with the null tetrad @xmath108    for the simplification of the complex divergence of the congruence the function @xmath109 is most often chosen as @xmath110    our main interest lies in the class of regular null geodesic congruences with a vanishing shear .",
    "this condition is achieved by first imposing the shear - free condition on @xmath38 i.e. , the differential condition@xcite",
    "@xmath111    and then requiring solutions to be regular functions ( expandable in spherical harmonics ) on the ( @xmath6 ) sphere . to solve this equation",
    "we introduce the ( complex ) auxiliary function , \\{a cr function } @xmath112 by    @xmath113    by using the inverse function to @xmath114 i.e. , the ucf    @xmath115    and implicit differentiation , @xmath49 can be written as @xmath116 and eq.([shearfree ] ) becomes    @xmath117    the general regular solution , @xmath118 to eq.([shearfree ] ) is then given in the parametric form @xmath119 where @xmath120 are four arbitrary _ complex _ functions of @xmath121 since eq.([t ] ) is invariant under @xmath122 we can take @xmath83 so that @xmath123 is a unit@xmath124lorentzian four - vector , @xmath125 . using the spin - s tensor notation@xcite    @xmath126    eqs.([l * * ] ) and ( [ x * * ] ) become @xmath127    we comment again that @xmath49 is a complex function that describes a stereographic ` angle ' field on real @xmath1 i.e. , a direction field that determines a null geodesic congruence .",
    "it is generated by the ucf that is determined by an arbitrary complex world - line in complex minkowski space @xmath128 when @xmath49 from eqs.([l * * * ] ) and ( [ x * * * ] ) is used in eq.([ngc  ] ) , we obtain the explicit form for any regular shear - free null geodesic congruence .    later , in more general situations , we will use this form , eqs.([l * * * ] ) and ( [ x * * * ] ) , for the first two harmonics .",
    "curvatures come from the higher harmonics .",
    "an alternative meaning of eq.([ngc  ] ) is that it defines a coordinate transformation from the natural coordinates of the congruence ( @xmath129 ) to the minkowski coordinates , @xmath104 .",
    "one can in a straightforward way find the flat metric in these coordinates .    from eq.([ngc  ] ) , calculating the differentials we find @xmath130d\\overline{\\zeta }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + p^{-1}[(r - r_{0}-\\text{\\dh } \\overline{l})m^{a}-\\text{\\dh } l\\overline{m } ^{a}-ln^{a}+(l-\\text{\\dh } r_{0})l^{a}]d\\zeta .",

    "@xmath138    this form of the metric is very close to that the type ii twisting metrics@xcite .",
    "if the world - line @xmath120 was described by a _ real function of a real _ @xmath44 though eqs.([tetrad * ] ) and ( [ metric * ] ) could still be used \\{with now @xmath139 } , there however is a simpler set of coordinates , namely ( @xmath140 ) , associated with the non - twisting congruence , that can be used@xcite .",
    "they are given by @xmath141 where @xmath142 by a computation similar to that with the complex curve we obtain the flat metric in @xmath143 coordinates , @xmath144 which is very similar in form to the type ii ( non - twisting ) robinson - trautman metrics@xcite ..    as we pointed out , in flat space the ucf is _ not unique_. it is determined , in general , by an arbitrary complex world - line in complex minkowski space .",
    "however in the presence of an asymptotically vanishing maxwell field ( with non - vanishing total charge ) one can construct , from the maxwell field itself , a unique complex world - line ( the complex center of charge)@xcite and from it a unique ucf can be found .",
    "for example , the lienard - wiechert charged world - line defines@xcite the real @xmath145 .    in the case of asymptotically flat vacuum space - times ,",
    "properties of the weyl tensor are used to define the world - line@xcite and the unique ucf . in the case of asymptotically flat einstein - maxwell space - times",
    "there are in general two different complex world - lines , determined respectively by the properties of the weyl tensor and the maxwell field . as we said earlier ,",
    "we here consider only the case where the two lines coincide .",
    "in this section we outline - leaving out many of the details - how the ucf is determined in asymptotically flat space - times .    for asymptotically flat space - times , the basic radiation data is the bondi asymptotic shear , @xmath146 , a complex function given on @xmath0 which , as we mentioned earlier , we assume can be analytically extended a short way into @xmath11 , and hence written as @xmath147    the @xmath147 describes the shear of the null geodesic congruence that are the null generators of the bondi null surfaces given by @xmath148 in the neighborhood of @xmath0 . any new _ asymptotic _",
    "null geodesic congruence can be obtained by a lorentz transformation ( specifically a null rotation around the null generators of @xmath149 at @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath103 are the tangent vectors to the bondi congruence the new tangent vectors , @xmath150 in the neighborhood of @xmath151are given by@xcite @xmath152 with @xmath45 , at this point , an arbitrary complex function on @xmath39 the asymptotic shear of the new congruence is given by@xcite @xmath153 by requiring that the new congruence have vanishing asymptotically shear , we see that @xmath45 must satisfy the differential equation , eq.([ethl * ] ) ,    @xmath154    where now we are considering the extension into the complex .",
    "the technique for studying properties of solutions of eq.([ethl * * ] ) is quite similar to what was done in the minkowski space case , eq.([shearfree ] ) .",
    "again we introduce the new complex auxiliary function @xmath155 by @xmath156 and its inverse @xmath157 which eventually leads to the ucf . \\{note that we have the useful gauge freedom @xmath158 in the determination of @xmath159 by implicit differentiation of eq.([ucf ] ) ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath160 we find the implicit form of @xmath52@xmath161 continuing with the change of variable , eq.([ethl * * ] ) becomes @xmath162 a well studied equation , frequently referred to as the ` good - cut ' equation@xcite .",
    "its solution , which depend on four complex parameters , @xmath163 ( defining h - space ) is written as @xmath164 now by taking an arbitrary world - line in the parameter space , @xmath165 we have the parametric form of the solution to eq.([ethl * * ] ) , @xmath166 it is important to notice \\{see eq.([x * * * ] ) } that in the harmonic expansion of @xmath33 we can take the first four harmonic coefficients , @xmath167 , as the @xmath168 i.e. , write @xmath169 and that @xmath170    we see that in both the flat - space case and for asymptotically flat space - times the freedom in choosing a regular shear - free or asymptotically shear- free null geodesic congruence lies in the arbitrary choice of a complex world - line in the parameter space , i.e. , complex minkowski space or h - space - or via the alternative interpretation , the space of complex poincar translations .    the issue is : _ can one uniquely determine this world - line _ ?",
    "_ in minkowski space the answer is no , except when there is an asymptotically vanishing charged maxwell field_. using the null rotation , eq.([nullrot ] ) , and requiring the vanishing of the coefficient of the @xmath171 harmonic of the maxwell tetrad field , @xmath172 ( the complex dipole term ) , one determines a unique world - line , the ` complex center of charge'@xcite .    _ for asymptotically flat spaces _ , with a similar null rotation , and then requiring the vanishing of the @xmath93 harmonic of the weyl tensor component , @xmath173 i.e. , the complex mass dipole terms , _ the world - line _ @xmath174 _ _ is again determined__@xcite.as the details for the determination of the unique complex curve have been described earlier@xcite and a further discussion would take us far afield , we will not pursue this issue here .",
    "we note that the information in the bondi shear begins with the @xmath175 , i.e. , quadrupole , harmonic while the ucf , in addition to its higher harmonics , @xmath176 2 , also contains the information in the @xmath177 harmonics obtained from the unique world - line . in other words while the ucf uniquely determines the bondi shear , eq.([goodcut ] ) , the bondi shear only determines the higher harmonics of the ucf .",

    "we note that in the very special case , when the unique asymptotically shear free congruence is also twist - free , the ucf , @xmath178 will be a real function of a real @xmath25 it could then be interpreted as simply the coordinate transformation between bondi time and nu time .    to end this section",
    ", we describe the natural relationship our ucf has with the elegant mathematical idea of a cr structure@xcite .",
    "the ucf defines or induces a cr structure on the real @xmath0 in the following fashion : from the ucf we obtain @xmath179 as above , but now restrict @xmath180 to the real @xmath39 then define the cr structure by ( the equivalence class of ) the three one - forms , one real and the complex conjugate pair : @xmath181    writing @xmath182 the functions @xmath183 and @xmath184 are the cr functions defining the embedding of @xmath0 into * * c**@xmath185 both satisfying the cr equation , i.e. , @xmath186 etc . , which was originally our defining equation for @xmath187 it is natural since the complex conjugate pair ( @xmath188 ) are the dual covectors to the @xmath148 surfaces of @xmath0 and @xmath189 is the real one - form determining the null direction of the new asymptotically shear - free null geodesic congruence .",

    "though our issue here is the analysis of the type ii twisting metrics - with and without a maxwell field - we nevertheless want to begin with a brief discussion of the non - twisting case , i.e. , the robinson - trautman metrics .    since robinson - trautman ( rt )",
    "metrics have been extensively studied and written about@xcite , we will confine ourselves to the discussion of their relationship with the ucf .    rather than beginning with the differential equations for the determination of the robinson - trautman ( rt ) metrics , we reverse the proceedings",

    "though later in this section we will speculate on some of the physical significance of our observations , we first summarize our general construction .    in an arbitrary asymptotically flat space - times , we started with families of _ regular _ asymptotic shear - free null geodesic congruences , described by its ( stereographic ) angle - field @xmath45 at @xmath348 that are generated by arbitrary complex curves in h - space .",
    "this function , @xmath38 and the associated curve are then completely determined by the requirement that the @xmath93 harmonic of the asymptotic weyl tensor component , @xmath349 should vanish .",
    "this leads to a unique complex world - line and ucf , @xmath350 which then is expanded in spherical harmonics .",
    "this general procedure was then applied to the analysis of the type ii metrics - using severe approximations . when the harmonic coefficients of @xmath351 were used in the bondi mass aspect ( in particular , the bondi energy - momentum four - vector ) and the bondi evolution equation",
    ", we were able to assigned to them ` natural appearing ' physical meaning .",
    "* first , by separating the real and imaginary parts , we could identify the @xmath352 harmonics and their derivatives , as the center of mass position and velocity vectors for the real parts and the specific spin - angular momentum for the imaginary part .",
    "then , from the mass aspect , we saw how the bondi energy and momentum took on a kinematic meaning in terms of these kinematic variables . * from the kerr metric and the charged kerr metric , we identified @xmath344 with the spin vector . from the mass loss equation ,",
    "we associate @xmath353 with the electric and magnetic dipole moments .",
    "this leads immediately to the dirac value of the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath346 .",
    "other multiple moments extracted from @xmath354 were identified via the energy loss theorem . * finally , using the kinematic expression for the momentum , in the bondi momentum loss equation we obtained equations of motion for the ` center of mass ' , determining the motion of what could be identified as a gravitational / electromagnetic rocket .    without any attempt at model building we automatically had the well - known radiation reaction force - which classically leads to the unpleasant run - away behavior",
    "but now it contains damping forces . though it is not at all clear if the damping terms are sufficient to stop the run - away behavior , nevertheless _ if _ there was an existence proof for the exact type ii solutions to asymptotically approach the kerr - newman metric that would be a strong indication for the suppression of the run - away affects@xcite .",
    "several questions concerning these results immediately come to mind .    * in what space is this motion taking place ? * in what sense could it be said that this motion is observable ? * are there any possible consequences that can be derived from these results ?    there are tentative answers to each .",
    "as we pointed out earlier , the motion can be thought of as taking place in either the space of the complex poincar translation group or in h - space with the velocity norm coming from either the minkowski or h - space metric .",
    "though neither of these spaces are observable directly , in principle - but almost certainly not in practice - the motion could be deduced by observing the special unique class of asymptotically shear - free null rays , and then studying the @xmath177 coefficients of the harmonic decomposition of their angular distribution .",
    "in other words the complex curve is there ( if these shear - free rays could be found ) but in a strange form .",
    "the real physical meaning of these results certainly is not at all clear .",
    "they do contain basic well - known classical equations : newton s 2nd law , rest and kinetic energy , the usual expression for momentum , the electromagnetic dipole radiation formula , the dirac value of the gyromagnetic ratio , the classical radiation reaction force , the gravitational quadrupole formula .",
    "in other words there is a strong suggestion that they do have meaning .",
    "if that were the case then they should be taken seriously and one should look for new physical results and predictions . for example , in eq.([m * * * * ] )",
    "we can see other contributions to the mass / energy ( in addition to rest energy and kinetic energy ) coming from the spin and from the electric charge .",
    "though very small they are being predicted .",
    "another interesting possibility arises from the radiation reaction force .",
    "this term in the equations of motion has been a source of considerable difficulty for classical electromagnetic theory@xcite .",
    "almost all attempts to study the classical motion of charged particles interacting with their own field has led to the unphysical run - away behavior .",
    "the usual answer to this problem has been to invoke quantum or quantum field theory@xcite .",
    "our suggestion or conjecture is that when our procedure is applied to any asymptotically flat einstein - maxwell space - time ( with the two world - lines coinciding ) , assuming that the space - time is well behaved and approaches reissner - nordstrom or charged kerr , _ then there will be a radiation reaction term in the center of mass equations of motion whose influence _ * will be suppressed * _ by gravitational affects_. there already are tentative results in this direction .",
    "this calculation is being planned for the near future . to do the calculation _ without _ the assumption of the coincidence of the two world - lines , though planned for the future , will be quite difficult .    as a final comment we mention that though there has been much mathematical work done on cr structures and gr ( see sec .",
    "iv , remark 3 ) , it appears to us that this is the first time that a cr structure has made relevant contact with physical issues .",
