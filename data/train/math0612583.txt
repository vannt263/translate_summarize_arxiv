    "we consider a random spatial service system governed by an aloha - type algorithm .",
    "more precisely , time is slotted , during a time slot @xmath0 a random number @xmath1 of users arrive in the system , and at each slot every user in the system requires service ( transmission ) with a certain ( transmission ) probability independently of all other users .",
    "the sequence @xmath2 is assumed to be i.i.d .",
    "the aloha multi - access algorithm was first proposed by abramson @xcite .",
    "the slotted scheme was introduced by roberts @xcite .",
    "we consider the latter setting . in the conventional centralised slotted aloha model",
    ", there is a single server . at the beginning of a time slot @xmath3",
    ", the total number @xmath4 of users in the system is known , and each of them asks for service ( transmission ) with probability @xmath5 independently of all others .",
    "if two or more users attempt transmissions simultaneously , then transmissions collide , the users remain in the system and try to transmit later .",
    "all service times are equal to @xmath6 , and the server is free at the beginning of any time slot .",
    "it is easy to show that for this system the maximum throughput is equal to @xmath7 .",
    "further , the markov chain @xmath8 is positive recurrent if @xmath9 and transient if @xmath10 .    when the information on the numbers @xmath4 of users is unavailable , various decentralised adaptive algorithms have been introduced and studied .",
    "algorithms of this type use the information on what has occurred in the previous time slot : either a conflict or a successful transmission or no attempted transmissions .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath11 be the number of users trying to transmit during a time slot @xmath3 .",
    "in a decentralised algorithm , only the values of @xmath12 are available at time @xmath13 . assuming that at any time slot @xmath3 the transmission probability is the same for all users , hajek @xcite proved that if @xmath14 are i.i.d . with a finite exponential moment , then @xmath15 is still necessary and sufficient for the existence of a stable algorithm .",
    "mikhailov @xcite generalised this result by weakening the exponential moment assumption to the requirement for only the second moment to exist , while foss @xcite generalised it further by dropping this as well as the independence assumption .",
    "we also refer to ephremides and hajek @xcite for a survey which includes , in particular , results in this direction .",
    "the model described above ignores the network s spatial diversity . in this paper",
    "we present a new model which allows the possibility for interaction between users to occur only when the distance between these users is small .",
    "a limited spatial interaction is a common feature of wireless networks and is thus very important for practical consideration .    in this paper",
    "we consider only spatial centralised schemes ( protocols ) where the total number of users in a neighbourhood is known .",
    "the study of decentralised protocols is a subject of our future research .",
    "our main result establishes the stability of the model under consideration . for that",
    ", we use the fluid approximation approach .",
    "we show that the state is repelled by the boundary , and in the interior , the euclidean norm turns out to be a lyapunov function for the fluid model .",
    "other results of the paper include convergence rates to stationarity and local ( in)stability .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the rest of this introduction is devoted to the description of the model and the statement of our main stability result . in section [ sec : fluid ] we prove that fluid limits of the workload in the system satisfy a certain differential equation . section [ sec : boundary ] is devoted to the analysis of the behaviour of fluid limits on the boundary of the positive orthant . in section [ sec_proof ]",
    "we present a proof of our main stability result and formulate one of its possible generalisations .",
    "section [ sec : rates ] deals with rates of convergence towards the steady state .",
    "sections [ sec : local ] and [ behaviour ] contain some interesting results on the behaviour of solutions to the differential equation .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : extensions ] we conclude with some extensions of our model , which are in a certain sense more applicable to real systems .",
    "in particular , these extensions include systems where various changes in environment conditions may result in changes in the radius and/or direction of interference between the message transmissions ) .",
    "let @xmath16 be an undirected graph with a finite set of vertices , say @xmath17 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath18 is connected . for the graph @xmath18",
    "we use the standard notion of the graph distance . for @xmath19 , let @xmath20 be the neighbourhood of a vertex @xmath21 , i.e. the set of vertices at a maximum distance of @xmath6 from @xmath21 in the graph . in the particular case where all vertices have the same number of neighbours , we denote by @xmath22 the cardinality of @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "we introduce now a service system with spatial ( neighbourhood ) interactions associated with the graph @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that time is slotted , i.e. , arrivals and services may occur only at times @xmath25 .",
    "suppose that there is a service station at each vertex of @xmath18 .",
    "the arrival process is denoted by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the number of users arriving at time @xmath3 at a vertex @xmath21 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "denote by @xmath30 the vector representing the number of users arriving between time instances @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath33 is an i.i.d .",
    "sequence ( while the coordinates of the vectors may be dependent ) .",
    "we also suppose that @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "if values of @xmath36 do not depend on @xmath21 , then we write @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number of users at vertex @xmath21 at time @xmath3 .",
    "at time @xmath3 , a user at vertex @xmath21 attempts transmission independently of the others with probability @xmath41 .",
    "this user receives service if he is the only user attempting transmission in @xmath23 at time @xmath3 .",
    "we suppose that all service times are equal to @xmath6 and that any user leaves the system immediately upon service completion .",
    "let @xmath42 be the number of users attempting transmission at time @xmath3 at vertex @xmath21 .",
    "then @xmath43 is a binomial random variable with parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are independent variables conditioned on @xmath46 .",
    "the sequence @xmath47 forms a time - homogeneous irreducible markov chain , which satisfies the recursion    @xmath48    to explicitly show the dependence of @xmath46 on the initial condition @xmath49 , we may sometimes write @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath51 , then the @xmath21-th component of the drift vector is given by the expression    @xmath52 = \\lambda_i - \\frac { x_i}{\\sum_{k \\in v_i } x_k } \\left(1-\\frac { 1}{\\sum_{k \\in v_i } x_k}\\right ) ^ { x_i -1 } \\prod_{j \\in v_i \\backslash \\{i\\ } } \\left(1-\\frac { 1}{\\sum_{k \\in v_j } x_k}\\right ) ^ { x_j},\\ ] ]    and if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 = \\lambda_i$ ] .",

    "let @xmath63 .",
    "note that @xmath64 is bounded from above by @xmath6 and if @xmath65 then @xmath66 in particular , @xmath67 is a homogeneous function of order @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 for any @xmath70 .",
    "we now comment on the model . in this paper",
    ", we mostly consider the _ symmetric _ case , where @xmath71 for all @xmath72 and the graph @xmath73 is @xmath74-regular : the cardinality of @xmath23 is equal to @xmath22 for all @xmath21 .",
    "notice that , even in this case , the graph @xmath73 is not necessarily completely symmetric .    note also that the system is not monotone .",
    "indeed , @xmath75 ( component - wise ) does not imply that @xmath76 stochastically dominates @xmath77 .",
    "neither is the system monotone with respect to the graph structure : if @xmath78 is embedded into @xmath79 , this does not imply that the workload process built on graph @xmath78 is stochastically dominated by the workload built on graph @xmath79 .",
    "we also present a number of generalisations to a non - symmetric case .",
    "in particular , using methods suggested recently in @xcite , we formulate in remark [ rem : stolyar ] sufficient conditions for the stability of the system with space - inhomogeneous input .",
    "some other generalisations of the model are proposed in section [ sec : extensions ] .",
    "we first explain the intuition hidden behind the result .",
    "consider the symmetric case , @xmath37 , @xmath24 , @xmath80 .",
    "the access protocol favours an equilibrium of the workload in the network : assume that the workload at node @xmath21 is much larger than the workload in its neighbouring nodes , @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 is close to @xmath6 , whereas @xmath83 is close to @xmath68 for all the other nodes @xmath84 in @xmath23 .",
    "thus the workload at node @xmath84 in @xmath23 will tend to get closer to the workload at node @xmath21 . from this balance mechanism",
    "one can guess that the diagonal @xmath85 is an attractive set .    if the workload vector belongs to the diagonal : @xmath86 where @xmath87 , then we obtain : @xmath88 hence , as @xmath89 tends to infinity , the drift vector converges to @xmath90 .",
    "so finally , we end up with the conjecture that if @xmath91 , then the markov chain @xmath92 is ergodic .",
    "this conjecture is clearly true for the fully isolated graph and for the complete graph .",
    "the reasons that led to this conjecture appear to be _ wrong _ ( this will follow from the results of sections [ sec : local ] and [ behaviour ] , which show that in general the main diagonal is not attractive ) . however , the conjecture itself is true and we can formulate our main stability result that will be proved in section [ sec_proof ] .",

    "we will show that all fluid limits satisfy a certain differential equation and then proceed with the analysis of that equation .",
    "the proof of ( ii ) is standard : the state @xmath95 is achievable from any other state and from itself .",
    "so , the state @xmath96 is positive recurrent ( due to ( i ) ) and the markov chain @xmath92 is aperiodic .",
