    "it has long been realized that the outer reaches of accretion disks around active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and young stellar objects ( yso ) may be gravitationally unstable ( for a review see , for agn : @xcite ; ysos : @xcite ) . instability in a keplerian disk sets in where the sound speed @xmath6 , the rotation frequency @xmath7 , and the surface density @xmath8 satisfy @xmath9 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath10 for a `` razor - thin '' ( two dimensional ) fluid disk , and @xmath11 for a finite thickness isothermal disk @xcite . the instability condition ( [ qdef ] ) can be rewritten , for a disk with scale height @xmath12 , around a central object of mass @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 .    in a steady - state disk",
    "whose heating is dominated by interior turbulent dissipation and whose evolution is controlled by internal transport of angular momentum , the accretion rate @xmath16 , where i have used the @xmath17 formalism of @xcite . then @xmath18 implies gravitational instability ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this does not apply to disks dominated by external torques ( e.g. , a magnetohydrodynamic [ mhd ] wind ) or disks heated mainly by external illumination .    for a young , solar mass star accreting from a disk with @xmath19 at @xmath20 equation ( [ instcrit ] ) implies that instability occurs where the temperature drops below @xmath21 .",
    "disks may not be this cold if the star is located in a warm molecular cloud where the ambient temperature is greater than @xmath21 , or if the disk is bathed in scattered infrared light from the central star ( although there is some evidence for such low temperatures in the solar nebula , e.g. @xcite ) . if the effective value of @xmath17 is small and heating is confined to surface layers , however , as in the layered accretion model of @xcite , then instability can occur at much higher temperatures .",
    "agn disk heating is typically dominated by illumination from a central source .",
    "the temperature then depends on the shape of the disk .",
    "if the disk is flat or shadowed , however , and transport is dominated by internal torques , one can apply equation ( [ instcrit ] ) .",
    "for example , in the nucleus of ngc 4258 @xcite the accretion rate may be as large as @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ instcrit ] ) then implies that instability sets in where @xmath23 .",
    "if the disk is illumination - dominated , however , then @xmath24 fluctuates with the luminosity of the central source .",
    "the fate of a gravitationally unstable yso or agn disk depends on how it arrived in an unstable state . to understand why ,",
    "consider an analogy with convective instability in stellar structure theory .",
    "the evolution of stellar models with highly unstable radial entropy profiles are of little interest , because convection prevents such models from being realized in an astrophysically plausible setting .",
    "similarly , highly unstable disks may be irrelevant because the action of the instability would prevent one from ever arriving in such a state .",
    "gravitational instability must be `` turned on '' in a natural way .",
    "an initially stable keplerian disk can be driven unstable by an increase in surface density ( e.g. @xcite ) or by cooling . in an @xmath17 disk model ,",
    "the surface density changes on the accretion timescale @xmath25 ( more rapid variation of surface density could be obtained by dumping material onto the disk or by application of a direct magnetic torque ) .",
    "the temperature , by contrast , changes on the cooling time , @xmath26 .",
    "this suggests that in cool disks ( @xmath27 ) , cooling is the dominant driver of gravitational instability .    once gravitational instability sets in , the disk can attempt to regain stability by rearranging its mass to reduce @xmath8 , or by heating itself through dissipation of turbulence .",
    "dissipation can occur directly through shocks or indirectly via a turbulent cascade to the viscous scale .",
    "if one can model the effects of `` gravito - turbulence '' on a cool disk as an @xmath17 viscosity , then mass shifting can be accomplished only on the accretion timescale @xmath28 .",
    "heating occurs on the thermal timescale @xmath29 .",
    "this suggests that cool disks will attempt to reestablish stability through dissipation of turbulence .",
    "let us assume that cooling drives the disk toward instability , and that the disk tries to recover through turbulent dissipation .",
    "there is now the possibility of a feedback loop .",
    "if @xmath24 is too large then heating by gravito - turbulence is weak and the disk cools toward instability . if @xmath24 is too small , heating by gravito - turbulence is strong and the disk is pushed back toward marginal stability .",
    "the feedback loop acts as a thermostat to maintain @xmath3 , just as convection in stars drives the entropy profile toward marginal stability .",
    "the effectiveness of the feedback loop in maintaining @xmath3 is controversial . @xcite",
    "have considered disk models with @xmath30 .",
    "indeed it is not clear that the feedback is strong enough to preserve @xmath3 .",
    "cooling might be so rapid that the disk fragments before it can heat @xcite , leading to formation of gas giant planets or stars .",
    "the feedback loop is an old idea in the theory of galactic disks ( @xcite ; there heating due to star formation balances cooling ) and in accretion disk theory @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments on cooled collisionless disk models @xcite do yield disks with @xmath3 , and clumping with sufficiently strong cooling .",
    "observations of star forming regions of galactic disks also show @xmath31 in the gas @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments with fluid disks often assume a fixed temperature profile or a fixed entropy profile @xcite .",
    "a fixed temperature profile is relevant to an illumination - dominated disk .",
    "other work considers the adiabatic evolution of an initially unstable state @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite is most comparable to that presented here .",
    "it examines the evolution of cooling , global models of the disks , but with a more complicated treatment of the cooling function .    in this paper",
    "i consider the nonlinear evolution of cooling , self - gravitating fluid disks via numerical experiment .",
    "the disk model is razor - thin ( two dimensional ) and local . in  2",
    "i describe the model , then show that its angular momentum flux density can be calculated analytically (  3 ) , provided that the disk does not fragment .",
    "the results of numerical experiments are described in  4 .",
    "conclusions are given in  5 .",
    "the direct , numerical evolution of a global self - gravitating disk model over many dynamical times is prohibitively expensive . to develop a converged , calculable , numerical model , and to reduce the number of free parameters associated with a global disk model , i make two simplifying assumptions : that the disk is cool ( i.e. thin , so @xmath32 ) and that it razor - thin .",
    "a cool disk can be modeled using a rigorous expansion of the equations of motion through lowest order in @xmath33 .",
    "this model is called the `` local model '' or `` shearing sheet . ''",
    "the expansion proceeds as follows .",
    "choose a fiducial point @xmath34 that corotates with the disk .",
    "define a set of local cartesian coordinates @xmath35 , and expand the equations of motion to first order in @xmath36 . to do this",
    ", one needs to assume that the departures from circular orbits in the disk @xmath37 , and similarly that the perturbed potential @xmath38 . with this assumption , the local model describes the evolution of the disk near the fiducial point .",
    "the self - consistency of these orderings can be tested in the nonlinear evolution .",
    "i will also use a `` razor - thin '' disk approximation that treats the disk as two dimensional .",
    "there is good agreement between razor - thin models and full three dimensional evolution in the linear theory of polytropic slender tori ( goldreich et al .",
    "1986 ) , in nonlinear simulations of polytropic tori ( hawley 1990 ) , and in nonlinear simulations of gas flow in spiral arms with an isothermal equation of state ( tubbs 1980 ) .",
    "in general there can be no rigorous mapping between razor - thin disks and full three - dimensional systems because the vertical structure contains degrees of freedom that are absent in the razor - thin model .",
    "the equations of motion in the local model read , where @xmath39 is the velocity , @xmath40 is the ( two - dimensional ) pressure , and @xmath41 is the gravitational potential with the time - steady axisymmetric component removed : @xmath42 for constant pressure and surface density , @xmath43 is an equilibrium solution to the equations of motion .",
    "this linear shear flow is the manifestation of differential rotation in the local model .",
    "the equation of state is @xmath44 where @xmath40 is the two - dimensional pressure and @xmath45 the two - dimensional internal energy .",
    "i will adopt @xmath46 throughout .",
    "the two dimensional ( 2d ) adiabatic index @xmath47 can be mapped to a 3d adiabatic index @xmath48 in the low - frequency ( static ) limit . for a nonself - gravitating disk @xmath49 ( e.g. goldreich et al .",
    "1986 , ostriker et al .",
    "1992 ) . for a strongly self - gravitating disk",
    ", one can show that @xmath50 .    if the evolution is strictly adiabatic and the initial conditions are isentropic , then @xmath51 with @xmath52 it follows that the `` potential vorticity '' @xmath53 obeys @xmath54 .",
    "there is a close connection between the conservation of potential vorticity and the stabilizing effects of rotation @xcite .",
    "processes that cause the potential vorticity to evolve can compromise rotational support of the disk at long wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the internal energy equation is @xmath55 the final term is the cooling function , and @xmath0 is the cooling time .",
    "in general @xmath56 .",
    "i will make the simplifying assumption that @xmath57 notice that there is no heating term ; heating is due solely to shocks .",
    "numerically , the fluid is heated by artificial viscosity in shocks",
    ".    the gravitational potential is determined by the razor - thin disk poisson equation : @xmath58 for a single fourier component of the surface density @xmath59 this has the solution @xmath60 a finite thickness disk has weaker self - gravity , but this does not qualitatively change the dynamics of the disk in linear theory @xcite .",
    "i use the `` shearing box '' boundary conditions , described in detail by @xcite .",
    "they apply to a rectangular domain of size @xmath61 by @xmath62 , although i will assume , unless stated otherwise , that @xmath63 .",
    "the boundary conditions may be written , for dependent variable @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xmath66 these boundary conditions have been used to study accretion disks @xcite , galactic disks @xcite , and planetary rings @xcite .",
    "i integrate the governing equations using a self - gravitating hydrodynamics code based on zeus ( stone & norman 1992 ) .",
    "zeus is a time - explicit , operator - split , finite - difference method on a staggered mesh .",
    "it uses an artificial viscosity to capture shocks .",
    "my implementation has been tested on standard linear and nonlinear problems , such as sound waves and shock tubes , with acceptable results .",
    "the transport scheme differs significantly from the basic zeus algorithm .",
    "i divide the transport step into two pieces : one due to the mean velocity @xmath67 and the other due to the remaining , perturbed velocity .",
    "the mean velocity transport is done by linear interpolation , while the perturbed velocity transport is done as in zeus .",
    "the `` ghost zones '' outside the boundaries are likewise set using linear interpolation .",
    "this algorithm has the advantage that the timestep is limited not by the large shear velocity at the radial edges of the grid , @xmath68 , but by the perturbed velocities only .",
    "longer timesteps can therefore be used , and numerical diffusion is reduced and more nearly uniform across the grid .",
    "i solve the poisson equation using the fourier transform method , modified for the shearing box boundary conditions .",
    "the density is periodic in shearing coordinates @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "thus when @xmath72 , which happens at intervals @xmath73 , the model is periodic in @xmath74 .",
    "i linear interpolate @xmath8 onto a grid in @xmath69 , solve for the potential via fourier transform , linear interpolate the potential back onto a grid in @xmath74 , and then difference to obtain the acceleration .",
    "there is one subtlety involved in the solution of the poisson equation . in the fourier domain",
    ", the grid of available wavenumbers forms a parallelogram in the @xmath75 plane whose shape changes with time .",
    "i use only those wavenumbers with @xmath76 in the solution , where @xmath77 is the numerical resolution of the model .",
    "this restricts the gravitational kernel to the largest circular region in fourier space that is always available .",
    "this restriction ensures that the gravitational force is approximately isotropic on small scales .",
    "i have tested my algorithm on three problems .",
    "first , i tested the transport piece of the code .",
    "i evolved , for one rotation period , initial conditions in which @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and a square of enhanced density was placed in the middle of the grid .",
    "the square sheared out , crossed a radial boundary , and returned to its initial position .",
    "the density enhancement diffused somewhat , but no features were introduced at the boundary crossing .",
    "second , i tested the code s ability to conserve potential vorticity .",
    "i evolved initial conditions containing a sinusoidal velocity perturbation for several shear times .",
    "only modest diffusion of potential vorticity was observed .",
    "finally , i checked the evolution of a sinusoidal density perturbation against linear theory .",
    "a comparison of code output with linear theory is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the test model has @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and no cooling .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . linear theory ( see @xcite , and references therein ) gives the evolution of the amplitude @xmath87 of a shearing wave @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the heavy solid line in the figure shows the linear theory result .",
    "the other lines show the evolution of the test models , which start at @xmath91 ( poorest agreement with linear theory ) and run by factors of @xmath92 up to @xmath93 .",
    "since the radial wavenumber of the disturbance increases with time , the wave eventually becomes wrapped up and unresolved . at the end of the run ( @xmath94 ) the radial wavelength is @xmath95 , or @xmath96 zones .",
    "evidently the numerical integration converges on the linear theory result .",
    "consider the following jacobi - like `` integral '' for the shearing box : @xmath97    here @xmath98 is the tidal expansion of the effective potential about the fiducial point , and @xmath41 is the potential of surface density fluctuations .",
    "the integral is taken over the entire simulation area and from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "now evaluate @xmath101 using the energy equation , the equations of motion , the poisson equation , and the boundary conditions : @xmath102 where the surface integral is taken over one of the radial boundaries ( the azimuthal boundaries do not contribute because they are periodic ) . to obtain this result",
    ", one must realize that terms proportional to @xmath103 vanish when integrated over the boundaries , while terms proportional to @xmath104 do not .",
    "now average equation ( [ dgamma ] ) over @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , replacing @xmath108 by @xmath109 .",
    "if the disk can settle into a steady state then @xmath110 and @xmath111 the left hand side is the shear stress , which is proportional to the angular momentum flux density .",
    "the shear stress can be divided into a hydrodynamic piece and a gravitational piece .",
    "the hydrodynamic shear stress is obtained via the usual reynolds decomposition : the fluid velocity is is reduced to the sum of a mean steady part @xmath67 and a fluctuating part @xmath112 .",
    "then the associated `` reynolds stress '' is @xmath113 notice that the mean radial velocity is of order @xmath114 , so in the local model , accurate to first order in @xmath115 , the mean radial velocity is zero .",
    "thus the local model can be used to calculate a shear stress , but a global model is needed to relate the shear stress to an accretion rate .    the gravitational piece of the shear stress is @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "the vertical integral arises because the gravitational field outside the disk contributes to the shear stress .",
    "the vertical integral can be done analytically in the fourier domain , giving the space - averaged gravitational shear stress : @xmath117 the sum is over all fourier components .",
    "it is convenient to express the shear stress in terms of an effective @xmath17 : @xmath118 using equation ( [ avgsol ] ) , and @xmath119 , i find @xmath120 for @xmath46 , @xmath121 it is remarkable that it is possible to calculate @xmath17 analytically for this simple model . equation ( [ analpha ] ) does not close the system of equations for disk evolution , however , because in general @xmath122 is a function of the disk temperature .",
    "it is the local analog of the result that the surface brightness of the disk is independent of the details of the angular momentum transport mechanism .",
    "fixing @xmath24 would close the system of equations , but @xmath24 is not known _",
    "a priori_. this result , however , can serve as a check on numerical work .",
    "it also explains the empirical relation between cooling rate and angular momentum flux reported by @xcite .",
    "consider the evolution of a single `` standard '' run , with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the initial velocities are @xmath125 , @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is a white noise random velocity field of subsonic amplitude ( the outcome is nearly independent of the details of these perturbations ) .",
    "the initial internal energy is such that @xmath81 , and the cooling time is @xmath128 .",
    "the evolution of the kinetic , gravitational , and thermal energy per unit area , normalized to @xmath129 , are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the evolution of the gravitational and hydrodynamic components of @xmath17 are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the @xmath17 s have been smoothed to make the plot readable .",
    "a snapshot of the surface density at @xmath130 is shown as a color plot in figure 4 ; red is high density and blue is low density .",
    "as the model evolves the small initial velocity fluctuations grow exponentially and develop into nonlinear surface density , velocity , and potential fluctuations .",
    "shocks of a predominantly trailing orientation develop and heat the gas , while cooling works to reduce the gas entropy .",
    "density structures develop which are sheared out by differential rotation and are also predominantly trailing .",
    "the tendency of velocity and density structures to take on a trailing figure gives rise to a finite @xmath17 .",
    "eventually the thermal energy of the disk settles down to a steady state in which the disk is near the point of marginal stability , as hypothesized by @xcite .",
    "the mean stability parameter @xmath131 fluctuates slightly , but averages @xmath132 over the last @xmath133 of the run .",
    "this is larger than the neutrally stable value ( @xmath81 ) , but small enough that the disk remains sensitive to nonaxisymmetric disturbances .",
    "this confirms the hypothesis that the disk maintains @xmath3 .",
    "the analytic theory of the last section predicts that @xmath134 .",
    "averaging over the final @xmath133 of the run , i find @xmath135 .",
    "the difference is due to energy nonconservation .",
    "grid scale velocity differences are damped by numerical averaging .",
    "that fraction of the energy extracted from the shear that does not go into shocks and shock heating winds up in a turbulent cascade and is lost at the grid scale ( one could close the energy equation by introducing a viscosity , but this introduces a new set of dynamical complications that will be treated in a separate publication ) . the sense of the difference can be understood by noting that @xmath17 measures the rate of energy extraction from the shear flow .",
    "the extracted energy flows by shock heating into thermal energy of the disk , and from there to cooling . in a steady state , all must balance . if some of the energy is lost before heating the disk , the loss must be compensated for by an increase in the rate of energy extraction .",
    "the fates of gravitationally unstable disks can be divided into two classes , depending on the cooling time .",
    "i find that for short cooling times , @xmath136 , the model disk fragments .",
    "this is easy to understand : for very short cooling times pieces of the disk cool and collapse before they have an opportunity to collide with one another and reheat the disk @xcite .",
    "fragmentation is illustrated in figure 5 , which shows a snapshot from a run with @xmath137 . in this run",
    "the disk initially fragments into 6 bound objects , which then undergo collisional agglomeration .",
    "ultimately a single bound object forms which is itself a self - gravitating accretion disk .",
    "this disk has a rotation frequency @xmath138 , and so it is able to sustain accretion due to repeated gravitational instability because @xmath139 .    when @xmath2 , the outcome is similar to that of the standard run : repeated local cycles of cooling , instability , and shock heating .",
    "according to the analytic theory of  [ analyt ] , @xmath140 in this regime .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath17 vs. @xmath0 for @xmath141 .",
    "the points are measurements from numerical experiments ; the solid line is the analytic result .",
    "the numerical experiments give slightly high values , for reasons discussed in  [ stdrun ] .",
    "the preceding discussion is predicated on the idea that gravitational instability can be studied in a local model .",
    "it has been argued by @xcite ( hereafter bp ) that the long - range nature of the gravitational force precludes such a study . here",
    "i argue in return that , if certain conditions are fulfilled , it is self - consistent to study transport of angular momentum by gravitational instability in the local model .",
    "the local model is an asymptotic expansion of the governing equations for a thin accretion disk to lowest order in @xmath142 in the neighborhood of a `` fiducial point '' .",
    "it assumes that one is studying structures on lengthscales @xmath143 , that perturbed velocities @xmath144 , and that the perturbed potential @xmath145 .",
    "the poisson equation is solved self - consistently in a wkb expansion ( see @xcite for higher order corrections ) . even if @xmath146 there are several astrophysically plausible ways the local expansion might fail .",
    "first , structure could exist in the potential on scales large compared to @xmath147 .",
    "for example , a bar might drive a large - scale disturbance in the neighborhood of the fiducial point .",
    "bars can not be generated self - consistently near the fiducial point because , as i will show below , gravitational instability only generates structure on scales comparable to @xmath147 .",
    "the bar must be generated elsewhere in the disk , where @xmath148 .",
    "it is therefore a condition for validity of the local model that such large - scale external forcing be absent .",
    "second , subtler structures may exist in the velocity field , surface density , or pressure on scales larger than @xmath147 .",
    "for example , bp have argued that gravitational instability can extract energy from differential rotation , then transform it into waves that propagate over distances large compared to @xmath147 before dissipating .",
    "such long - range coupling would invalidate a local treatment . while this is a live and interesting possibility for all types of disk turbulence , bp use linear theory to argue that self - gravitating disks are qualitatively different .",
    "global numerical experiments that contain large scale gradients in disk properties could falsify or confirm bp s hypothesis regarding wave transport in self - gravitating disks , but they are beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "i will briefly revisit linear theory to show that self - gravitating disks are not qualitatively different from nonself - gravitating disks .",
    "i will then use the outcome of the numerical experiments to show that long - range correlations in surface density , which might be expected to develop in the presence of substantial wave transport , are not present .    consider a density wave in a razor - thin keplerian disk .",
    "the disk structure varies only on a scale @xmath149 , and @xmath150 . the wave @xmath151 , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the wkb dispersion relation is @xmath154 .",
    "the doppler - shifted frequency @xmath155 has a minimum at @xmath156 .",
    "then the radial energy flux density , referred to an inertial frame , is @xmath157 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the full wave energy flux .",
    "bp s `` anomalous flux '' , by comparison , is the gravitational component of the energy flux measured in a corotating frame . shutting off self - gravity is equivalent to taking @xmath158 in eq.([lineflux ] ) . evidently the wave energy flux does not change qualitatively in this limit",
    "wave energy fluxes may nonetheless be present . if they are to change disk structure significantly , however , they must be of the same order as the turbulent energy flux @xmath159 .",
    "if i assume that @xmath160 , @xmath3 , and @xmath161 , and drop factors of order unity , i find that @xmath162 ( for acoustic waves in a nonself - gravitating disk , @xmath163 is replaced by @xmath164 ) .",
    "thus for @xmath165 the wave energy flux is as important as the turbulent energy flux .    to proceed",
    "further one can only consider the plausibility of a large amplitude , high-@xmath166 wave propagating over significant distances in the disk . here",
    "are two arguments against this .",
    "first , a density wave can only propagate a distance @xmath167 before it turns into an acoustic wave ( @xmath168 ) . in a finite thickness disk",
    "this corresponds to a wavelength smaller than a scale height .",
    "if the disk is stratified three - dimensional effects will modify the wave ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the wave is likely to steepen , shock , and dissipate .",
    "second , the gravito - turbulent state contains fluctuations that emit , scatter , and absorb waves .",
    "if scattering and absorption are strong , as they are here , coherent signals are destroyed . under these circumstances",
    "it seems unlikely that energy will be transmitted over large scales by waves .",
    "what can the numerical models tell us about the locality of angular momentum transport in self - gravitating disks ?",
    "i have used two methods to assess the locality of structure in the nonlinear outcome of my models .",
    "in the first analysis , i calculate the dimensionless autocorrelation function of the surface density , @xmath169 @xmath170 coherent wave trains would appear as large - scale correlations in the surface density .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show the autocorrelation function averaged from a series of 5 snapshots at @xmath171 .",
    "figure 7 shows the spatial structure of the correlation function from a run with @xmath172 and @xmath124 .",
    "evidently density correlations are concentrated in a region that is much smaller than the size of the model .",
    "figure 8 shows cuts through the correlation function ( along the rays marked `` short axis '' and `` long axis '' in figure 7 ) that confirm this quantitatively .    also shown in figure 8 is the autocorrelation function for a run with @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( the same spatial resolution as the larger model ) .",
    "differences between the smaller and larger model result are small and attributable to sampling noise .",
    "the correlation function thus appears to depend only weakly on @xmath175 , at least for @xmath176 and @xmath128 .",
    "this argues that surface density structure is locally determined .    in a second analysis ,",
    "i have calculated which fourier components of the surface density dominate the gravitational shear stress .",
    "figure 9 shows the quantity @xmath177 here @xmath41 is an angular coordinate in fourier space .",
    "this is the contribution to the gravitational shear stress from fourier components of the surface density in the annulus between @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the result is calculated from a model with @xmath172 and @xmath180 .",
    "fully @xmath181 of the angular momentum transport comes from wavenumbers with @xmath182 .",
    "thus wavelengths significantly smaller than the model size dominate the shear stress .",
    "figure 9 can be used to estimate how cool a disk must be for the local model to be applicable .",
    "if the wavenumber @xmath183 of the maximum in @xmath184 is to satisfy @xmath185 , then one needs @xmath186 where i have used @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "yso disks have @xmath189 and so are at best marginally described by a local approximation .",
    "some agn disk models are much thinner and thus may be accurately described with a local model . in disks that violate condition ( [ loccond ] ) , such as those studied by @xcite",
    ", global effects can be important .",
    "most experiments described in this paper have been run at multiple resolution to determine convergence .",
    "the resolution at which convergence is achieved depends on what is being measured .",
    "consider the convergence of @xmath17 , as measured numerically .",
    "figure 10 shows @xmath17 , averaged over the final @xmath133 of the run , in a model with @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "evidently @xmath17 has converged .",
    "investigation of models of different physical size shows that convergence requires resolution of a fixed physical scale which is @xmath192 .",
    "the autocorrelation analysis of  [ locality ] shows that large - scale structures are not established on a dynamical timescale .",
    "suppose , however , that gravito - turbulence acts as a viscosity on long - wavelength modes .",
    "then there is the possibility of a secular instability analogous to that of viscous , self - gravitating disks discussed by @xcite , and also @xcite .",
    "these instabilities grow on the viscous timescale , @xmath193 .    as a preliminary test for secular instability ,",
    "i have integrated two large ( @xmath194 ) , high - resolution ( @xmath174 ) models for @xmath195 .",
    "one model had @xmath196 , the other @xmath128 .",
    "the energy evolution of the latter is shown in figure 11 .",
    "there is no clear trend in any of the energy components over the course of the simulation .",
    "the @xmath196 run is similar .",
    "if secular instability is present , it grows only on longer timescales .",
    "returning to the analogy with secular instability of viscous , self - gravitating disks , an integrations over a time @xmath197 can be regarded as a test for secular instability over wavelengths @xmath198 .",
    "for the integrations described here @xmath199 .",
    "thus longer integrations , although expensive , hold the possibility of interesting results .",
    "what are the implications for the structure of disks around ysos ?",
    "although our results are not rigorously applicable , since @xmath115 is typically of order @xmath200@xmath201 in the outer parts of yso disks , they may provide a guide to the relevant physics .    in models of unilluminated yso disks @xcite @xmath24 approaches unity at a radius @xmath202 , where the temperature is @xmath203 .",
    "illumination can change @xmath204 dramatically ( @xcite ; for more recent models see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for sufficiently strong illumination , or sufficiently low mass disk ,",
    "the entire disk is gravitationally stable .",
    "as the illumination is reduced some radii become gravitationally unstable .    at gravitationally unstable radii",
    "there are two possible outcomes .",
    "if the cooling time of the disk is sufficiently long ( @xmath205 ) , then gravitationally driven turbulence will simply enhance the shear stress above that available from other sources , such as mhd turbulence .",
    "this shear stress is generated in a region of order @xmath206 across and all the numerical evidence is consistent with its being locally determined and treatable as an @xmath17 viscosity ( but only if @xmath207 ) .",
    "recurrent instability and shock heating maintain @xmath208 , somewhat larger than the value required for axisymmetric stability .    if , on the other hand , the cooling time in the disk is short ( @xmath209 ) , the outcome is dramatically different",
    ". such short cooling times might be found in a disk heated mainly by external illumination that is suddenly switched off ( for example , in yso disks , as an fu orionis outburst turns off ) . in this case the model disk fragments , as suggested by @xcite in the context of agn disks .",
    "the long - term evolution of these systems is uncertain because it is intrinsically global ; the fragments undergo collisional agglomeration within bands in radius .",
    "clearly one possible outcome is the formation of gas giant planets ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , but the final mass of the object depends on the global evolution .",
    "global models including more realistic cooling functions ( such as those developed by @xcite ) , and external illumination , are clearly desirable .",
    "agn disk models also generally become gravitationally unstable at large radius @xcite .",
    "they typically have @xmath207 and so the local approximation is more applicable than in yso disks .",
    "typically at large radius their cooling time is short ( equivalently : the @xmath17 required to prevent instability becomes large ) .",
    "the numerical models presented here suggest that fragmentation , and perhaps star formation , is likely under these circumstances .",
    "i am grateful to jeremy goodman , steve balbus , ramesh narayan , and john papaloizou for their comments .",
