    "spin glasses are well understood at the mean field level . after more then twenty years from the physical clarification of the nature of the spin glass phase of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite , recent progress in mathematical physics @xcite is rapidly leading to a complete mathematical confirmation of the physical implications of replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) .",
    "unfortunately , as soon as one goes beyond mean field , our ability to make predictions becomes more limited .",
    "large theoretical efforts devoted to extend the replica symmetry breaking theory to finite dimensional systems @xcite , have not led to an unanimous consensus on the nature of the spin glass phase in finite dimension .",
    "approximate renormalization schemes @xcite and phenomenological theories commonly known as droplet models @xcite , suggest that glassiness in finite dimension could be very different from the mean field , and indeed much simpler .",
    "rigorous attempts to describe low temperature spin glasses are fully compatible both with the replica symmetry breaking scenario and with droplet like spin glass phases @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite while giving strong indications that replica symmetry braking might extend down to dimension three , do not solve the controversy , since it is always possible to argue that the systems are not large enough , the samples are not equilibrated etc .",
    "it has been recently suggested that the nature of the low temperature finite d spin glasses can be studied in an asymptotic expansion around mean field using models with long but finite interactions of the kac kind @xcite .",
    "some progress has been achieved , proving that for large enough interaction ranges , the free - energy is close to the mean field . moreover , if one admits a mild hypothesis of stochastic stability of the gibbs metastate w.r.t .",
    "some random perturbations , mean - field spin glass order holds at least on a local level : the distribution of overlaps on scales of the order of the interaction range is close to its mean field limit .",
    "the problem about the nature of the spin glass phase in finite dimension can be rephrased as the question if the mean - field order can become long - range above a finite lower critical dimension .",
    "it is clear that in low enough dimension ( @xmath0 ) long range order is not possible and local mean field order should cross over to paramagnetic behavior on large scales . even if one feels that this case is much simpler that the high dimensional one , a theoretical approach to this cross - over is at present still to be developed . in this letter",
    "we initiate the study the crossover from spin glass to paramagnetic behavior in a 1d spin glass model with variable interactions via monte carlo numerical simulations .",
    "we first verify in explicit simulations the expected property of genericity of the unperturbed model , and show that local overlaps approach mean field behavior . then we investigate the growth of the correlation length for spin - glass order with the interaction range , and we find that , analogously to non - disordered models , the correlation length grows more rapidly than the interaction range .",
    "the model we consider consists in a chain of spins @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) with periodic boundary conditions , interacting through the hamiltonian @xmath3=-\\sum_{\\mu=1}^m j^\\mu \\sigma_{i^\\mu } \\sigma_{j^\\mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 , the indexes @xmath5 are chosen independently from term to term with uniform probability among the couples such that @xmath6 for some @xmath7 while the @xmath8 are i.i.d.r.v .",
    "equal to @xmath9 with equal probability @xcite .",
    "if @xmath10 the model reduces to the viana - bray diluted spin glass , that for @xmath11 admits a low temperature mean field spin glass phase @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the model is very simple : for finite @xmath7 , the model is paramagnetic at any positive temperature . on the other hand",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in the kac limit , @xmath12 after the thermodynamic limit @xmath13 , one recovers the mean - field phase diagram , with a second order phase transition at a temperature @xmath14 , below which the system is in a spin glass phase with full rsb @xcite .",
    "in order to characterize the behavior of the system we study the local overlap between configurations on a scale @xmath7 .",
    "we partition the line @xmath15 into disjoint , contiguous boxes @xmath16 , ( @xmath17 ) of size @xmath7 and consider the local overlap between spin configurations @xmath1 , and @xmath18 as : @xmath19",
    ". a simple generalization of the proof given in @xcite shows that if one couples the original hamiltonian with suitable finite range random perturbations , one generically has that the probability distribution of the local overlap , induced by the boltzmann distribution on spin configurations @xmath20 and @xmath21 and and the quenched random couplings , is close to the overlap distribution function ( odf ) of the infinite range viana - bray model for the same temperature and value of @xmath22 .",
    "this has the characteristic shape of mean - field spin glasses with full rsb , with two delta peaks at the extremal values @xmath23 and a smooth part in between @xcite .",
    "`` generically '' refers here to the fact that the property is proven almost everywhere in an interval of values of the couplings with the perturbations .",
    "the stochastic stability property amounts to say that the case of zero couplings is not a singular exception . in order to check that indeed this is the case , we simulated the model in 1d for a value of @xmath24 , where the mean field critical temperature is @xmath25 . in order to equilibrate the system for large samples we used parallel tempering @xcite . in this way",
    "we could reach interaction ranges @xmath26 for system sizes of @xmath27 without appreciable finite @xmath28 effects .",
    "all quantities we study are averaged over 100 different samples , and we have checked the stability of the average , comparing with the average over 50 samples .    in figure",
    "[ pr ] we show the behavior of the function of @xmath29 for @xmath30 and various values of @xmath7 .",
    "it is apparent that in both cases , increasing the interaction range , the function @xmath29 approaches the characteristic mean field shape .",
    "this contrast with the behavior of the pdf of the global overlap , which for a paramagnet in the thermodynamic limit has a single delta peak in zero .",
    "we then study the crossover to paramagnetic behavior of the overlap on increasing the scale of observation . to this scope",
    ", we define overlaps as before , but on boxes of size @xmath31 and study the distribution as a function of @xmath32 . in figure [ p16 ] this is done for @xmath33 and @xmath30 , where we see a clear passage from spin - glass behavior at short lengths to paramagnetic behavior at large scale .    in order to study more quantitatively this crossover , we considered the overlap - overlap correlation function @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes average over the boltzmann and quenched coupling distribution .",
    "paramagnetic behavior means that this function should tend to zero at large distance , and in one dimension one can expect the behavior : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the local average of the overlap square , and @xmath38 is the correlation length of the system , which is expected to diverge in the low temperature region @xmath39 for @xmath12 .    in this letter",
    "we concentrate on the critical region where @xmath40 is small . in that case",
    "one should cross - over to paramagnetic behavior for finite @xmath7 to mean field critical behavior for @xmath12 , in which case @xmath41 and , for positive @xmath21 , @xmath42 .",
    "analogously to the well studied case of non - disordered systems @xcite , the crossover will be described by scaling functions : @xmath43 where the properties of the functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 for large and small argument @xmath46 should be compatible with the expected behavior : namely @xmath45 should go to positive constants for large negative values of @xmath47 while it should behave as @xmath48 for small argument to cut - off the mean - field singularity .",
    "analogously , @xmath44 should go to a positive constants for large positive values of @xmath47 , to zero for large negative values and behave as @xmath49 for small @xmath47 .",
    "the value of exponent @xmath50 can be guessed through the observation that rsb effects should not affect the critical properties of the system for @xmath51 . in that case",
    ", one can argue that the fluctuations of the order parameter are captured by a cubic field theory @xcite which in the case of the 1d kac model reads : @xmath52=r \\int dz \\ ; \\left ( \\left(\\nabla q(z ) \\right)^2 -\\tau q(z)^2 + \\lambda    q(z)^3\\right ) \\label{cubic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a positive constant .",
    "simple scaling analysis predicts then the value @xmath54 .",
    "this field theory should also in principle suggest the behaviour of the function @xmath55 for large negative arguments , but we did not attempt to follow this route .    in order to confirm our predictions about the critical exponents and determine the scaling functions we simulated the model for @xmath24 and various values of @xmath7 and temperatures .",
    "we first investigated the behavior of the overlap correlation function at the critical temperature @xmath56 , in figure [ critico ] we plot the behavior of @xmath57 as a function of @xmath7 showing that the expected behavior @xmath58 is very well respected : we find small corrections to scaling that only affect the data points for @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the inset , we plot the scaled function @xmath61 , showing that the expected scaling holds for the whole probability distribution .",
    "we next investigated the behavior of the correlation function . in figure [ collapse ]",
    "we show the collapse of @xmath62 when plotted as a function of @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "again , we verify our scaling form , assuming small deviations from scaling .",
    "notice that the assumed exponential form for the correlations is very well verified for all @xmath65 .",
    "the same holds at all the temperatures we looked at .",
    "we then pass to the task of evaluating the scaling functions . in figure",
    "[ scaling - c0 ] we plot , for various temperatures , @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 which gives the function @xmath68 .",
    "as expected , @xmath69 behaves quadratically for large positive values of @xmath47 .",
    "the behavior at large negative values can also be understood , since this is the regime where the effective coupling constant in the cubic theory should tend to zero and @xmath70 , leading to @xmath71 .",
    "analogously we can understand the behavior of the scaling function @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ scaling - xi ] ) : for small @xmath47 , @xmath55 has the expected square root singularity with a different prefactor above and below the critical temperature , as it is usual , while it goes to a constant for large negative values .",
    "the behavior of the function @xmath45 for large positive values should describe the cross - over from critical to low temperature behavior , in particular , it should determine the behavior of the correlation length in the low temperature phase .",
    "unfortunately , the data we have , though indicate that a power law behavior @xmath72 may persist at low temperature with an exponent @xmath73 larger then @xmath74 , do not allow a precise determination of the exponent @xmath73 which would require larger interactions ranges @xmath7 .",
    "summarizing we have studied the crossover from paramagnetic to mean field behavior in a 1d kac spin - glass model .",
    "our work has a qualitative aspect , from which we get evidence that stochastic stability holds at low temperature , and a quantitative aspect where we study the crossover from paramagnetic to mean - field behavior close to @xmath56 .",
    "we characterize this crossover through scaling functions describing the behavior of the local edwards - anderson parameter @xmath57 and the correlation length @xmath38 .",
    "we find that while in the high temperature phase the correlation length is , in units of the interaction range @xmath7 , independent of @xmath7 , in the low temperature phase a dependence on @xmath7 sets in .",
    "the correlation length grows as @xmath75 in units of @xmath7 at the critical point , while it grows faster at lower temperatures .",
    "this means that in units of lattice constant the correlation length grows as @xmath76 or faster .",
    "this result shows that the rigorous analysis of @xcite just provides a lower bound to the size of the regions where local mean - field order holds .",
    "further studies will be necessary to make a quantitative analysis deep in the low temperature region and to go to higher dimension ."
