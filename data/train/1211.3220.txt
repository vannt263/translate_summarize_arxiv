    "<S> we performed an angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of si - doped @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we observed very small photoemission intensity near the fermi level corresponding to non - dispersive states assigned to si impurities . </S>",
    "<S> we show evidence for a quantization of these states that is accompanied by a confinement in the momentum space consistent with a real - space finite confinement observed in a previous scanning tunneling microscopy study . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that this semi - localization in the conjugate spaces plays a crucial role in the electronic conduction of this material .    </S>",
    "<S> its transparency and relatively high conductivity compared to other semiconductors , even at low temperature ( @xmath3 ) , promote the wide gap semiconductor @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 as an attractive candidate for optoelectronic applications @xcite . despite general enthusiasm for this material , </S>",
    "<S> there is no commonly accepted picture to explain its conductivity , which calls for a complete characterization of the electronic states near the fermi level ( @xmath4 ) of this material . a recent scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) investigation of si - doped @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 evidenced the presence of si impurity donor states very near @xmath4 @xcite . from their spatial extension @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> the authors conjectured that conductivity likely occurs from hopping between nearby impurities . </S>",
    "<S> however , stm is a real ( @xmath6 ) space measurement that can not image directly how electrons propagate in materials . as a natural complement , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) </S>",
    "<S> is a powerful tool to access directly the electronic band structure of materials in the momentum ( @xmath7 ) space that can be used to address this problem . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , previous arpes studies of @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 did not report any state near @xmath4 @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we report an arpes characterization of the electronic states at low - energy ( @xmath8 ) in the @xmath7 space of si - doped @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe very weak intensity signal at the brillouin zone ( bz ) center associated to non - dispersive states likely related to si impurities . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these states are quantized and that their corresponding momentum distribution curve ( mdc ) profiles remain restricted in @xmath7 space over a wide @xmath8 range .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 were grown using an edge - defined film - fed growth method and electron - doped to a concentration of @xmath9 @xmath10 with si atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> arpes measurements were performed with photon energy ( h@xmath11 ) in the 20 - 200 ev range at the u1-nim and apple - pgm beamlines of the synchrotron radiation center ( stoughton , wi ) using a vg - scienta r4000 and a vg - scienta ses 2002 multichannel analyzers , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> additional measurements were performed in tohoku university using a vg - scienta ses 2002 multichannel analyzer and the he - i@xmath12 line of a he - discharging lamp ( h@xmath13 ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were cleaved _ in situ _ along the ( 100 ) plane and maintained in a vacuum better than @xmath14 torr . </S>",
    "<S> a previous stm study on samples from the same batch indicates that the cleaved samples have atomically flat surfaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically checked that the samples were not charged by varying the intensity of the incident light beam .    </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig01_corelevels](a ) a typical core level spectrum of @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 recorded with h@xmath15 ev . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to excitations at -146.5 ev and -143 ev attributed to auger transitions from their h@xmath11 dependence ( kinetic energies @xmath16 of 44.0 and 47.5 ev , respectively ) , most of peaks can be simply assigned to ga and o core levels . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is dominated by the weakly dispersive ga 3@xmath17 states at a binding energy ( @xmath18 ) of 21.66 ev . in comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the valence band originating from o 2@xmath19 states is one order of magnitude weaker . </S>",
    "<S> it locates between 4.6 to 13 ev ( tail to tail ) below @xmath4 . as expected from the 4.5 - 4.9 ev semiconducting gap reported for this material @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the spectral intensity is almost 0 up to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the near-@xmath4 zoom displayed in inset indicates a finite density of states , with a spectral intensity 10@xmath20 times smaller than that of the valence band at this particular h@xmath11 value .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a ) photoemission spectra of @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 recorded with h@xmath15 ev . </S>",
    "<S> inset : 10@xmath21 zoom near @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) fs intensity map . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) edcs recorded around @xmath22 with h@xmath23 ev.,width=321 ]    this small density of states at @xmath4 was not detected in previous arpes studies focusing on the valence band and the semiconducting gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to characterize it further , we performed careful arpes measurements near @xmath4 . band structure calculations @xcite predict a minimum at the bz center ( @xmath22 ) for the conduction band of @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the fs displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig01_corelevels](b ) shows only a very small spot of intensity at @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the energy distribution curves ( edcs ) corresponding to an arpes cut crossing the @xmath22 point given in fig . [ fig01_corelevels](c ) do not show evidence for dispersion within our experimental accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum recorded exactly at @xmath22 shows a 2-peak feature that will be described below . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral intensity fades rapidly away from @xmath22 and is already virtually zero at @xmath24 @xmath25 , where no fermi edge is detected .    </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between @xmath26 and the h@xmath11 allows us to estimate the electronic dispersion along this direction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such procedure has been performed previously for the valence band of @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite . to investigate the @xmath26 variations of the near-@xmath4 states </S>",
    "<S> , we performed h@xmath11 dependent measurements over a wide @xmath8 range . </S>",
    "<S> we show in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02_hv](a)-(i ) arpes intensity cuts recorded with h@xmath11 between 20 ev and 28 ev . with h@xmath11 increasing from 20 ev , the spectral intensity increases and reaches a maximum at 26 ev , before it starts to decrease . </S>",
    "<S> although the intensity of the arpes spectra depends on h@xmath11 , the spectral shape seems not to vary significantly . in particular , the 2-peak structure is well observed at each h@xmath11 value . </S>",
    "<S> this assertion is confirmed by the edcs at the @xmath22 point , which are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02_hv](j ) . </S>",
    "<S> despite strong intensity variation , the lineshape of the edcs and the position of the two peaks are quite constant . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the states do not disperse along @xmath26 , in contrast to band structure calculations suggesting that the bottom of the conduction band at @xmath22 is highly dispersive along @xmath26 @xcite . as we show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig02_hv](k ) , we find a resonance at 26 ev that we can assigned univocally to neither ga nor si electronic states .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a)-(i ) h@xmath11 dependence of an arpes cut crossing the @xmath22 point . </S>",
    "<S> ( j ) h@xmath11 dependence of the edc at the @xmath22 point recorded at the u1-nim beamline of the synchrotron radiation center . </S>",

    "<S> ( k ) h@xmath11 dependence of the spectral weight @xmath27 integrated between -0.6 to 0.1 ev and normalized at h@xmath28 ev . the color code for the data recorded at the u1-nim beamline ( full symbols ) is the same as in panel ( j).,width=321 ]    additional information on the near-@xmath4 states can be obtained by varying the polarization of the incident photons . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03_pol ] , we compare spectra at the @xmath22 point obtained with @xmath29 and @xmath30 polarized photons . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the @xmath29 polarization , the @xmath30 polarization is not pure in our experiment and the corresponding vector potential has a finite component perpendicular to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this component is mainly responsible for the differences in the edcs displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03_pol](a ) since they are recorded at normal emission and thus they should be identical for pure @xmath29 and @xmath30 configurations . as confirmed with the arpes intensity plots shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03_pol](b ) and [ fig03_pol](c ) , polarization strongly modulates the spectral intensity . </S>",
    "<S> this is also true for the near-@xmath4 states , as indicated by the near-@xmath4 arpes intensity plots given in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03_pol](d ) and [ fig03_pol](e ) for @xmath30 and @xmath29 polarizations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the strong lost of spectral intensity in the @xmath29 configuration as compared to the @xmath30 configuration , even for the normal emission edcs shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03_pol](a ) , strongly suggests that the states near-@xmath4 are associated with @xmath31-oriented orbitals . due to the absence of @xmath7 dispersion , the states observed </S>",
    "<S> are most likely related with the 3@xmath32 orbitals of the si donors . </S>",
    "<S> however , our experiments do not allow us to completely rule out alternative scenarios such as a surface state related to the conduction band . in this latter case </S>",
    "<S> though , one would expect clear in - plane dispersion , which differs from our observation .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a ) comparison of edcs at the @xmath22 point recorded using h@xmath33 ev with @xmath29 and @xmath30 polarizations . an al filter was used to suppress the strong second order light background . </S>",
    "<S> inset : near-@xmath4 zoom . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) arpes intensity plot near @xmath22 recorded with 62 ev @xmath30-polarized photons . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) same as ( b ) but using @xmath29-polarized photons . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) near-@xmath4 zoom of the arpes intensity plot in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) near-@xmath4 zoom of the arpes intensity plot in ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset : mdcs corresponding to data in ( d ) and ( e ) , integrated from @xmath34 mev up to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the mdc recorded with @xmath30-polarized light is perfectly fit with a gaussian distribution.,width=321 ]    our previous assignment is somewhat unconventional since an object localized in the @xmath6 space , such as a si dopant atom , should lead to electronic states completely delocalized in @xmath7 space , which contrasts with our observation of arpes intensity uniquely in the vicinity of the bz center . </S>",
    "<S> to solve this apparent dilemma , we proceed in two steps . </S>",
    "<S> we first turn our attention to the lineshape associated with the near-@xmath4 states . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we performed measurements at lower @xmath3 ( 10 k ) and took advantage of the higher @xmath8 resolution provided by a he - discharge lamp . the resulting arpes intensity plot is displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig04_mode](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two peaks observed in the synchrotron data are still observed at @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev below @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the corresponding curvature intensity plot @xcite shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig04_mode](b ) reveals a third feature at @xmath37 mev that is confirmed by a broad shoulder in the integrated edc displayed in the inset of the same panel . </S>",
    "<S> although it can not be resolved within the current experiment , the tail of the edc extends to relatively high @xmath18 , suggesting the possible presence of additional peaks . </S>",
    "<S> as far as our measurements allow us to resolve them , the three peaks observed are evenly spaced by @xmath38 mev . </S>",
    "<S> noteworthy , we found experimentally that @xmath39 varies up to 10% from one sample to another , suggesting a possible relationship with si doping or with the precise distribution of the si impurities .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a ) arpes intensity plot recorded at 10 k with the he i@xmath12 line . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) corresponding curvature intensity plot @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inset : edc integrated between the vertical white dotted lines in ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> blue arrows indicate the position of the electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) hwhm of the mdcs as a function of @xmath18 for different h@xmath11 values . </S>",
    "<S> the results are from the same measurement , except for data obtained with the he discharged lamp ( 21.218 ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the synchrotron data have been obtained at 50 k while the he lamp data were recorded at 10 k and 175 k.,width=321 ]    what can cause such a quantization of the electronic states ? </S>",
    "<S> one may naively propose that a bosonic mode of energy @xmath39 interacts with the electronic structure . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> raman studies of @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 report several phonon modes for energies slightly smaller than 100 mev @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , such interaction usually leads to an anomaly or  kink \" in the electronic band dispersion observed by arpes due to the opening of an energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> for example , this situation is often found in the superconducting state of copper - based @xcite and iron - based @xcite high - temperature superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> a more likely scenario is the presence of a quantum well ( qw ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> actually , a qw has already been proposed to explain the optical absorption spectra of minority acceptor states in the vicinity of the valence band @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important corollary to the presence of a qw associated with the electronic states of the si impurities is that these electronic states are confined only within a typical distance @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the heisenberg uncertainty principle thus implies that the same states are confined in @xmath7 space as well within a momentum @xmath40 of the order of @xmath41 .    to investigate this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the mdc profile of the near-@xmath4 states . in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03_pol](c ) , we compare the mdcs at @xmath4 recorded on the same sample using @xmath30 and @xmath29 polarizations . except for an intensity difference , </S>",
    "<S> both profiles are similar and can be fit perfectly with a gaussian function . </S>",
    "<S> noteworthy , such behavior is similar to first principle calculations on oxygen - vacancy - disordered zno predicting @xmath7 space semi - localization for the o vacancy impurity sates @xcite , characterized by a loss of spectral coherence away from the zone center . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , gaussian functions can be used in @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 to fit the mdcs down to at least 500 mev below @xmath4 , which is way below the 3 impurity levels identified by arpes but still inside the tail of the near-@xmath4 feature . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig04_mode](c ) , we show the @xmath8 dependence of the half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) corresponding to the fits obtained for various h@xmath11 values . except for the low @xmath8 part where </S>",
    "<S> small anomalies are observed , the hwhm increases linearly with @xmath18 but remains finite , and no obvious influence from the probing h@xmath11 is noticed . near @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the hwhm is about @xmath42 @xmath25 for the synchrotron data presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig03_pol](c ) . as with the qw spacing , </S>",
    "<S> the hwhm varies slightly from sample to sample . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the high-@xmath8 resolution data shown in fig . [ fig03_pol](a ) are associated with a low-@xmath3 hwhm of @xmath43 @xmath25 , value that is quite robust against @xmath3 .    by rounding up the hwhm to 0.05 @xmath25 and associating this value to @xmath40 , we find that the corresponding spatial extension of the impurity wave function is about 20  . </S>",
    "<S> this value is quite consistent with a previous stm study on samples from the same batch @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the  size \" of the impurities can be characterized by a decay length in the spectral intensity at a bias voltage corresponding to the donor states . </S>",
    "<S> values ranging from 6 to 24 were found for si impurities in different locations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our arpes results confirm that these states carry some @xmath7 information , more precisely on the @xmath7 distribution of the spectral coherence . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> they can promote electrical conduction for si concentration sufficiently high to allow the wave functions from different impurities to percolate .    </S>",
    "<S> we caution that our interpretation of the multiple @xmath8 levels in terms of a qw is not unique . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the conduction band is expected to locate in the same @xmath8 range and could potentially explain some of the spectral intensity . yet </S>",
    "<S> , the absence of obvious @xmath7 dispersion remains puzzling and further theoretical and experimental studies are necessary to solve this issue . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our observation of a characteristic length for the @xmath7-space confinement of the spectral intensity is well supported and is a step towards a better understanding of the electronic properties of @xmath0-ga@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>"
