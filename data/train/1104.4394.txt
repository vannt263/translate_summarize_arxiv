    "( 160mm,60mm)figure11.eps    we conclude that the mid - infrared emission from irc2 , especially the warmer component in the sed , is scattered light that originally arises from source i , because ( 1 ) no dominant color temperature peak is seen at irc2 , ( 2 ) the near - infrared emission from irc2 is most likely to be scattered radiation because of large polarization , and also a good correlation is seen in the appearance of irc2 between the mid - infrared warmer component and the near - infrared emission , ( 3 ) a good correlation between the distribution of optical depth and the appearance of the warmer component is seen at irc2 , and ( 4 ) the warmer component can be reproduced by reddening process in scattering of emission from source i. therefore , irc2 itself , is not a dominant luminosity source , and also not a dominant energy source of kl , though some faint self - luminous objects may be embedded .",
    "recent millimeter observations revealed the existence of a `` hot core , '' with an estimated temperature of 350 k @xcite , southeast from source i. however , no mid - infrared counterpart to the hot core has been detected , probably due to high extinction .",
    "in contrast to the hot core , the submillimeter continuum peak sma1 is detected as a color temperature peak in figures [ color_temp ] and [ color_cont ] , though we can not identify any counterpart to sma1 at each wavelength image .",
    "sma1 is a protostellar object concealed by dense dust , just like source i.    @xcite and @xcite proposed that source i has an edge - on disk whose rotation axis is oriented along northeast - southwest ( ne - sw ) .",
    "the newly proposed ne - sw axis is different from the northwest - southeast ( nw - se ) axis previously proposed in 1980 s @xcite . as @xcite pointed out ,",
    "the ne - sw axis disk model is hard to reconcile with the observed nw - se direction of the large - scale outflow cavity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , under the hypothesis that the disk is responsible for the bipolar outflow that blows in the direction of the axis of the disk .",
    "our model , that irc2 represents the scattering of radiation from source i , also seems to be inconsistent with the new ne - sw axis disk model , because irc2 is approximately located northwest of source i. however , the inconsistency is canceled when the dominant illuminator of irc2 is the rotating disk around source i rather than the photosphere of its central star , while the surrounding near - infrared nebulosity is due to reflection of the light from the photosphere @xcite .",
    "as noted in subsection [ sec : astrometry ] , the proper motions of bn , source i , and source n were reported by many authors and the dynamical history of the orion bn / kl region was also discussed .",
    "there are claims that the large - scale high - velocity outflow is not the typical one powered by a disk accretion .",
    "@xcite proposed that a dynamical decay of a protostellar cluster resulted in the formation of a tight binary ( source i ) and the high - velocity ejection of bn and source n. then , @xcite proposed that the gravitational potential energy released by the formation of the source i binary resulted in the stellar ejection , and also powered large - scale outflow .",
    "@xcite presented another scenario that source i originally existed as a softer binary and that the gravitational energy was released in the process of hardening of the softer binary , after a dynamical interaction between source i and bn . the proper motion study of irc2 , e.g. , relative to source i , will be helpful information for discussing the evolutional history of source i and the origin of the high - velocity outflow .",
    "in this paper we present mid - infrared imaging and spectroscopic data of the orion bn / kl region .",
    "the distributions of silicate absorption strength and color temperature were calculated around irc2 with our -resolution data .",
    "the detailed structure of the color temperature distribution around irc2 , including source i and sma1 , has been revealed in the mid - infrared region for the first time . in the vicinity of irc2",
    ", the peak color temperature occurs at source i , and an increasing temperature gradient is seen from irc2 toward source i. the warmer component of the mid - infrared emission from irc2 can be reproduced by the scattering of radiation from source i. irc2 , itself , is not a self - luminous object , but illuminated and heated by an external source , an embedded young stellar object located at source i.    we would like to thank all the staff members of the subaru telescope and the staff of the smoka science archive system .",
    "we are also very grateful to an anonymous referee for detailed comments that improved the quality of our original manuscript .",
    "data analysis were in part carried out on the computer system at the astronomy data center , national astronomical observatory of japan .",
