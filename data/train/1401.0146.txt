    "in the last years there has been great interest in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics . in particular , systems with strong coupling between single quantum dots ( qds ) and high quality microcavities",
    "have been studied for different reasons , such us to gain insight into different quantum optics effects @xcite , like quantum decoherence , entanglement and possible applications in quantum information processing @xcite . for example , some of these systems were proposed as a single - photon source @xcite for realization of all optical quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the sc regime takes place when the coupling between a single quantum emitter and cavity mode is stronger compared to their decay rates . in this case , the emitter and cavity coherently exchange energy back and forth leading to rabi oscillations . the sc between single ( in ,",
    "ga)as qd and micropillar cavity modes @xcite , has become apparent in photoluminiscence data which displayed anti - crossings between the qd exciton and cavity - mode dispersion relations rei , yos , reit . while usually temperature was used to tune the energy of the excitonic transition to that of the cavity mode , it was shown recently that the magnetic field can also be used as a tuning parameter@xcite .",
    "some of the experimental works @xcite analyze their data in terms of a 2x2 matrix that mixes the exciton and the cavity mode . to introduce life time effects ,",
    "complex energies are used to represent the energies of the uncoupled system and therefore , the matrix is non hermitian .",
    "similar expressions for the rabi splitting were obtained using a master equation within a phenomenological framework @xcite , but to our knowledge , a microscopic description of the system which includes finite life times of the exciton and the cavity mode is still lacking ,    in this paper , we extend the hamiltonian which describe the coupling of the exciton and cavity modes @xcite to include the broadening of both excitations , due to a mixture with a continuum of bosonic excitations . the problem can be solved rigorously for weak excitation .",
    "we compare our results for the intensity of photoluminiscence with recent experimentsrei , reit .",
    "@xmath0[model ] the core of the model contains the cavity photon mode , the excitonic degrees of freedom represented by a spin @xmath1 , and the coupling between them andre .",
    "we include the coupling of the cavity mode with a continuum of radiative modes which gives rise to the broadening of the cavity mode ( the most important one ) @xcite .",
    "we also couple the excitonic mode with a continuum of bosonic excitations , leading to a broadening of the excitonic energy .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath2where @xmath3 is the creation operator of the cavity mode , @xmath4 are spin operators for the two level system of the qd with ground @xmath5 and excited @xmath6 state which represent zero and one exciton respectively , @xmath7 creates the radiative mode @xmath8 which couples to the cavity mode and similarly @xmath9 creates a bosonic excitation @xmath10 coupled to the exciton . for simplicity , the subscripts indicating the polarization of the modes are dropped .",
    "the first three terms of the hamiltonian describe the strong coupling between the cavity mode and the exciton @xcite .",
    "the fourth and fifth terms describe a continuum of radiative modes and its coupling to the cavity mode .",
    "the following two terms have a similar effect for the exciton mode .",
    "the model is similar to the one previously used by us to describe raman experiments in microcavities with quantum wells inside them leon1,leon2,bruc .",
    "the main difference is that in the previous case , the problem has a two dimensional translational symmetry leading to delocalized excitons , and for each wave vector the probability of occupation of the excitonic state is very small .",
    "this allows to treat the excitons as bosonic excitations with a high degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "this is not possible in the present case and the model becomes highly non trivial . in spite of this , some exact results can be derived , using the fact that the total number of excitations    @xmath11    is conserved .",
    "for example , clearly the ground state is the only state with @xmath12 .    in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the states of the system with @xmath14 cavity photons , exciton state @xmath15 and no bosons described by @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "if one of the latter is occupied , we denote the corresponding state by @xmath18 or @xmath19 . the hilbert subspace with @xmath20 can be treated analytically .",
    "this subspace consist of a state formed by zero cavity photon and one exciton , @xmath21 , and two continua of bosonic excitations @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the problem in this subspace takes a form similar to that of an impurity interacting with a continuum or the resonant level model .",
    "the photoluminscence measurements in micropillar cavities @xcite suggest that the only subspace relevant for the experiments is that with @xmath24 . to see this ,",
    "let us neglect for the moment the modes @xmath8 and @xmath10 responsible for the broadening of the cavity mode and the exciton . the resulting model which contains the three first terms of eq .",
    "( [ mod ] ) can be solved exactly @xcite . for each subspace of definite @xmath25 ,",
    "the model consists of two branches which have an anticrossing as a function of the detuning @xmath26 .",
    "the value of the rabi splitting is @xmath27 .",
    "experimentally only one anticrossing is reported .",
    "this indicates that the probability of exciting two modes is low and that the theoretical results for @xmath20 are enough to describe the experiments .",
    "motivated from the above discussion , we assume that the observed photoluminiscence is proportional to the density of cavity photons in the subspace with @xmath20 . in other words ,",
    "the observed intensity is proportional to the density    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a many - body green s function obtained from the diagonal matrix element of the state @xmath30 ( for brevity we denote @xmath31 ) of the operator given by the inverse of the hamiltonian in the subspace @xmath32    @xmath33    the matrix elements of the operator @xmath34 can be evaluated from the equation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the identity matrix .",
    "taking the element @xmath37 of this equation one obtains @xmath38proceeding in a similar way for matrix elements @xmath39 , and the indices of the new green 's functions that appear , the system of equations for @xmath40 can be closed . in particular the relations @xmath41replaced in eq .",

    "then , except for some real shifts that can be incorporated in @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite , the above sums reduce to imaginary constants that we take as parameters @xmath49    note that interchanging the subscripts @xmath50 and @xmath51 , eqs .",
