    "weyl semimetals ( wsm ) are three dimensional topological electronic systems whose low energy band structure is described by pairs of weyl fermions separated in momentum space .",
    "they were first proposed to occur in a class of iridate materials@xcite , but it was only recently that they were experimentally realized@xcite .",
    "the topological properties of wsms are encoded in a chern - simons ( cs ) term that stems from the axial anomaly .",
    "the anomaly is responsible of a plethora of phenomena like the axial magnetic effect@xcite , chiral separation effect@xcite , chiral magnetic waves@xcite and , more recently , a new mechanism for the phonon hall viscosity@xcite .    the experimental evidence of the wsm phase is based on arpes and transport experiments@xcite , and on optical conductivity experiments@xcite (",
    "optical measurements have been done in dirac semimetals as well@xcite ) .",
    "the cs term induces birefringence@xcite , and circular dichroism@xcite .",
    "it has been also proposed that chiral electromagnetic waves exist and propagate along domain walls in magnetic wsms@xcite .",
    "the interaction of light with magnons in wsms has been addressed in@xcite , while plasmons in weyl metals have also been studied@xcite .",
    "more recently , a new type of helicon mode under applied magnetic fields has been proposed@xcite at finite doping .",
    "here we address the problem of light propagation in a wsm at the neutrality point ( i.e. , the fermi level lies at the weyl nodes ) by computing the poles of the full photon propagator .",
    "a similar approach was done for quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) under an external magnetic field@xcite . for the case of the solid state - realized wsm",
    "there are two key aspects that are central : 1 ) nontrivial topology is present even in the absence of an external magnetic field and 2 ) contrary to qed there are two velocity scales in wsms : the fermi velocity of the electrons and the velocity of light in the material .",
    "we will see how these two features combine so that novel collective excitation behavior is realized .",
    "we will resort ourselves on a rpa treatment of the problem .",
    "this implies that we will effectively consider a non - self interacting weyl fermions interacting with an external electromagnetic field .",
    "the validity of a rpa treatment has been extensively studied in the literature for two dimensional dirac materials@xcite and more recently in the general case of interacting three dimensional dirac systems@xcite . following these references ,",
    "some of the results presented here might be extended to the self - interacting case under particular conditions ( @xmath0 expansions and so ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the model for wsm that we use and set notations . in section iii , we give the neccessary details for the computation of the polarization function and explain it . in section iv , we compute the spectrum of the electromagnetic collective modes through the spectral function , and describe the most salient features observed . in section v , we discuss the results and mention some future lines to follow from this work .",
    "our starting point is the low energy action of a wsm coupled to an electromagnetic field : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fermi velocity and @xmath3 is the speed of light in the corresponding material .",
    "this action describes two weyl fermions separated in momentum space by a vector @xmath4 so that time reversal symmetry is broken . without loss of generality will fix @xmath5 .",
    "quantum corrections to ( [ clasaction ] ) are well known to generate a nonzero odd part of the polarization function of the photon in the form of a cs term @xcite .",
    "the coefficient accompanying the cs term is ill defined , as it depends on the routing of internal momenta in the loop integrals as well as on the regularization method . in a solid state realization of a wsm",
    "this coefficient can be fixed by means of the bulk - boundary correspondence relating the theory in the bulk with the fermi arcs at the edges@xcite .",
    "another way is by considering the 3d band structure of a wsm as a set of independent 2d band structures , each of them with a well defined chern number@xcite .",
    "in addition to the action for the fermionic sector ( [ clasaction ] ) , the action for the electromagnetic field is : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the material respectively .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are related to the gauge field @xmath9 as : @xmath10",
    "in what follows we will obtain the 1-loop order polarization function in terms of @xmath9 .",
    "the computation has been performed and deeply examined by several authors , both the parity - even@xcite and parity - odd@xcite parts of the polarization function .",
    "we can write it as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the contribution at zero order in @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the first order correction .",
    "in@xcite it was shown that the polarization function is analytic in @xmath13 , and the correction to the even part is second order in @xmath13 , breaks gauge invariance and gives a mass to the photon . imposing gauge invariance by using a regularization which preserves it , as dimensional or pauli - villars regularizations ,",
    "one obtains a zero correction@xcite . regarding the odd part ,",
    "it is known to be linear in @xmath13@xcite and no corrections appear beyond the first order .",
    "( [ polarization ] ) is exact , i.e. there are not higher order corrections in @xmath13 .",
    "the computation of @xmath12 is standard . using dimensional regularization and in the minimal subtraction renormalization scheme : @xmath15 @xmath16 where the four momentum is @xmath17 , and where the space components of @xmath12 have a relative weight @xmath18 with respect to the time components , as can be read from eq .",
    "( [ clasaction ] ) . from now on we will redefine @xmath19 as @xmath20 so that @xmath21 . the parameter @xmath22 is an energy scale that appears in the process of dimensional regularization ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the appearance of this parameter reflects the formal absence of any characteristic scale in the linear electronic spectrum .",
    "it could be fixed by either the experiment or by invoking a standard renormalization program ( here we are dealing with a modification of standard quantum electrodynamics , that is well known to be renormalizable ) or related to the lattice cutoff of the underlying bandstructure by considering a full lattice model of the weyl semimetal , keeping in mind that there are several materials with very different lattice structures proposed to be weyl semimetals . for typical values of lattice spacings of the order of ngstrms , @xmath23 can be estimated to be @xmath24 ev , however , the reader should keep in mind that the low energy / long wavelength aspects of the results presented here do not depend on the particular value of @xmath22 as long as all the frequencies and momenta involved in the problem are presented in a _ dimensionless _ fashion ( that is , divided by @xmath23 ) no matter which regularization scheme is used .",
    "note that the function @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ polfunczeroorder2 ] ) has a constant imaginary part for @xmath26 which defines the electron - hole continuum threshold .",
    "a normal procedure would be to take the local limit @xmath27 in @xmath12 .",
    "as we know for graphene , at the neutrality point and zero temperature no well defined plasmon mode exists within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "however , it was shown that a plasmon pole appears beyond rpa when the momentum dependence in the polarization tensor is maintained@xcite , which highlights the importance of not considering the local limit in some circumstances . here",
    "we will limit ourselves to the rpa approximation but we will keep the momentum dependence , and we will see that staying away from the local limit is crucial for capturing the physics near the electron - hole continuum threshold .",
    "@xmath14 is precisely the cs term .",
    "we invoke the boundary - bulk correspondence to fix its value@xcite . on the @xmath28 gauge @xmath14",
    "has only one independent component : @xmath29 the presence of this non - diagonal term in the polarization tensor induces gyrotropy in the wsm , so that left- and right - handed polarized light propagate at different speeds@xcite .",
    "since we are working under the free electron approximation , eq.([oddpol ] ) is exact . in an interacting theory",
    ", @xmath30 acquires dynamically generated corrections ( see @xcite for an explicit discussion when interactions at constant external magnetic field and finite densities are considered , or @xcite for corrections in the strong coupling regime ) .",
    "the inverse full photon propagator can be written as : @xmath31 where the inverse free propagator can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ actionphoton],[actionphoton2 ] ) . to obtain the collective excitations we look for the poles of the full propagator .",
    "the equation @xmath32=0 $ ] on the @xmath28 gauge reads :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 represents the momentum in the plane perpendicular to @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the fine structure constant , @xmath37 gives the squared ratio between the speed of light and the fermi velocity , and : @xmath38 @xmath39 we will take the fermi velocity of the wsm similar to that of graphene ( @xmath40 ) and assume a coupling constant @xmath41 , which is reached with a relative permittivity of the material of @xmath42 .",
    "the speed of light of the wsm is given by @xmath43 ( assuming a relative permeability @xmath44 ) and the value of the squared ratio between the speed of light and the fermi velocity is @xmath45 .",
    "since we are not taking into account interactions between weyl electrons , a value of the effective coupling @xmath41 is not problematic , and this precise value has been chosen for convenience . in realistic solid - state wsm , however , it is not expected to have these values for @xmath46 and/or larger values of @xmath47 , resulting effectively in an smaller value of @xmath48 .",
    "there is a zero mode @xmath49 corresponding to the unphysical longitudinal gauge field , arising from the residual gauge freedom , as @xmath28 does not completely fix the gauge . for the remaining part , there are two physical transverse gauge fields .",
    "the dispersion relation of the unscreened field can be obtained from : @xmath50 instead of directly solving the equation , we will define a spectral function for this field : @xmath51.\\ ] ] the spectral function is plotted in fig . [ fig 1](a ) .",
    "we see that there is a peak with finite width , which corresponds to a damped mode , so that the delta function corresponding to a free photon is replaced in a wsm by an attenuated excitation .",
    "hence our first finding is that light is attenuated when propagating through a wsm .",
    "this behavior is rooted to the existence of two different velocity scales : the value of the fermi velocity is much smaller than the speed of light .",
    "this mismatch is encoded in the function @xmath52 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq unscreened mode ] ) , which fulfills @xmath53 .",
    "this means that in the limit where the value of the fermi velocity matches the value of the speed of light in the material , we have a non attenuated free photon traveling at the speed of light with dispersion relation @xmath54 . although the gapless nature of wsms means that there is no gap to overcome for electron - hole pair creation , we just showed that this is not enough for light attenuation , and that damping is generated for a system of gapless electrons only when there exist two non - equal competing velocity scales .",
    "this happens also in dirac semimetals since this property is not related to the cs term .    *",
    "( a ) *        * ( b ) *        the nontrivial topology of the wsm phase shows up inducing a screening in the other transverse gauge field",
    ". the dispersion relation can be obtained from the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq det ] ) . instead of solving the equation",
    ", we will again introduce a spectral function for this field : @xmath55.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the analysis following we will consider two separate cases : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "\\i ) @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "[ fig 1](b ) the spectral function is plotted as a function of @xmath58 and the momentum @xmath59 in the direction of @xmath35 .",
    "two branches of attenuated collective excitations coexist , one of them clearly gaped .",
    "the gaped nature of the screened field is expected in wsms , as the cs term acts as a topological mass for the photon@xcite .",
    "however we see that the second branch corresponds to a new excitation which seems to be gapless and considerably less attenuated than its gaped companion .",
    "in fact , at a certain large momentum @xmath60 there is a crossover where the gaped excitation enters into an overdamped regime , as can be seen from the absence of a well defined peak in fig . [ fig 1](b ) . to highlight the behavior of the novel gapless excitation at low frequencies near the electron - hole continuum threshold @xmath54 , we plot in fig . [ fig 2](a ) the spectral function as a function of the frequency in a logarithmic scale , for different values of @xmath60 .",
    "we see that there is a low energy crossover also for the novel excitation from an underdamped to an overdamped regime as the wavelength increases .",
    "overdamping appears for frequencies near the electron - hole continuum threshold .",
    "this suggests a gapless nature of this new excitation with dispersion relation @xmath61 at low energies .",
    "we see also that increasing the momentum @xmath60 , the gapless branch deviates from the linear dispersion behavior and approaches the gaped one . from fig .",
    "[ fig 1](b ) it is clear that the gapless branch starts to behave as a massive excitation for large enough momentum @xmath60 .",
    "\\ii ) @xmath57 .",
    "[ fig 1](c , d ) show the spectral function as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath62 for the values @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "it can be seen that increasing the perpendicular momentum produces a merging of the two branches into a single peak .",
    "this is a result of a second , high energy crossover for the gapless excitation which again becomes overdamped , but now at big enough @xmath65 . for energies near the electron - hole continuum threshold",
    ", we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig 2](b ) that small fluctuations in @xmath65 drive the gapless excitation across the low energy crossover from the overdamped to the underdamped regime , so in a realistic situation when the propagation is not perfectly aligned with the @xmath35 direction the gapless branch behaves as a well defined attenuated excitation at low energies .",
    "it is important to note that the behavior near the electron - hole continuum would have never been captured in the local limit @xmath66 of the polarization function .",
    "in particular the low energy crossover into the overdamped regime of the massless branch would have never been captured without considering the full momentum dependence .",
    "we have studied light propagation in a neutral wsm where the fermi level lies at the weyl nodes . in this situation",
    "there are two degrees of freedom corresponding to two transverse gauge fields , while the plasmon longitudinal mode that appears at finite chemical potential is absent . besides the generation of a plasmon mode ,",
    "the presence of a plasma frequency would also induce a gap to both transverse gauge fields , however at the neutrality point there is only one gaped mode , whose mass is a consequence of the nontrivial topology .",
    "our first finding is that light is attenuated when propagating through both weyl and dirac semimetals . in the case of wsms ,",
    "nontrivial topology shows up as a screening effect in one of the two transverse gauge fields , for which we find two branches of attenuated collective excitations .",
    "in addition to the known topologically gaped photon mode , a novel massless attenuated excitation appears , which is our second and most important finding .",
    "this splitting of a transverse field into two branches was obtained before for qed in the presence of an external magnetic filed@xcite , where the ciclotron frequency defines the mass threshold for the electron - hole continuum . in the case of a wsm",
    "there is no mass threshold as nontrivial topology is present in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore for the case of the solid state - realized wsm the fermi velocity of the electrons is much smaller than the speed of light , which translates into a completely novel collective behavior of the two branches .",
    "in particular we find that in a realistic situation of light collimated along the direction of @xmath35 but with small deviations in the perpendicular direction , the massless branch shows up as a well defined and damped peak in the spectral function . at low energies",
    "its dispersion relation is given by @xmath67 , which defines an excitation traveling coherently with the electrons at the fermi velocity .",
    "at the other limit of the spectrum ( @xmath68 ) the gapless branch behaves as a massive damped photon with velocity close to the speed of light .",
    "in the situation where light propagation is not aligned with @xmath35 and the momentum in the transverse direction is large enough , a crossover exists and the massless branch enters into an overdamped regime , corresponding to a peak with divergent width in the spectral function",
    ".    the novel optical excitation could provide a new and clean signature for wsms .",
    "it could be detected in experiments as an additional resonance on the transmission coefficient of light .",
    "there are also indirect proofs , like electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) or subluminal cherenkov radiation spectroscopy@xcite stemming from the small phase velocity of the novel excitation .",
    "in addition , due to the matching of the propagation velocity of the novel mode with the fermi velocity of the electrons , a counter intuitive enhancement of the effective dressed electron - photon interaction is expected .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the effect of the coulomb interaction enhancement due to the renormalization of the fermi velocity that appears , for instance , in graphene@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , although their effect is negligible on the bulk propagation of light , the 1d fermi arc chiral states at the edges of a wsm would give additional resonances as surface electromagnetic modes .",
    "however , the polarization tensor of 1d chiral electrons has already been computed in the literature@xcite and therefore the fermi arc contribution can be distinguished from bulk propagation .",
