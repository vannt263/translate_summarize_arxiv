    "the engineering of effective hamiltonians has played an important role in quantum information theory , where the design of interactions suited to implementing quantum logical processes is a key ingredient @xcite .",
    "engineered interactions are also required for quantum simulation , where controllable laboratory systems are assumed to simulate quantum phenomena that share the same mathematical structure but are difficult to handle in the laboratory @xcite . moreover ,",
    "engineered interactions are a precondition for the reservoir engineering technique , @xcite where a target state is protected .",
    "the strategy of switching off the reservoir and thus protecting any quantum state , based on the engineering of a nonstationary quantum system where a time - dependent hamiltonian must be appropriately prepared has also been advanced @xcite .",
    "more recently , two schemes were presented to produce steady nonclassical states within cavity qed @xcite and trapped ions @xcite , both relying on suitably designed interactions . in the former case , selected jaynes - cummings interactions are required where the two - level atom interacts with only two neighboring fock states of the cavity mode .",
    "these effective interactions are further used for atomic reservoir engineering and steady fock states of the radiation field are produced . in the latter case , upper- , lower - bounded and sliced jaynes - cummings ( jc ) and anti - jaynes - cummings ( ajc ) hamiltonians are required .",
    "the upper - bounded ( lower - bounded ) interaction acts upon fock subspaces ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 to@xmath7 ) and the sliced one is confined to a fock subspace ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath6 , for any @xmath8 . whereas the upper - bounded ( @xmath9 ) jc or ajc interactions",
    "are shown to drive any initial state to a quasi - steady fock state @xmath6 , the sliced one is shown to produce steady superpositions of fock states confined to the sliced subspace @xmath10 .    in this contribution , we present a strategy to engineer @xmath9 and sliced jc and ajc hamiltonians in cavity qed which , as already shown in the context of trapped ions @xcite , can be used , among other purposes , to produce steady fock states and to implement a quantum - scissors device for optical state truncation .",
    "we stress that the technique used to engineer @xmath9 and sliced interactions in cavity qed is completely different from that used with trapped ions , where a suitable adjustment of the lamb - dicke parameter is sufficient to bring about the desired interactions . in the other hand , as should be clear below , in cavity qed the required interactions results from appropriate adjustments in a sequence of raman - type transitions .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our protocol can also be used in other platforms such as circuit qed with fluxonium transitions @xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the engineering of @xmath9 hamiltonians acting upon fock subspaces ranging from @xmath4 up to @xmath11 . from these hamiltonians",
    "we show how to derive master equations with @xmath9 liouvillians via the atomic reservoir engineering scheme , which are then employed to produce the steady fock states @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "sliced hamiltonians confined to fock subspaces ranging from @xmath5 up to@xmath15 are also derived and used to generate sliced liouvillians which produce steady superpositions of fock states confined to the associated sliced subspaces .",
    "moreover , we present a strategy to generate @xmath9 and sliced master equations without needing first to engineer @xmath9 and sliced hamiltonians , which can also be used to produce steady fock states .",
    "we advance that the present scheme can be applied to a network of dissipative oscillators to produce steady entanglements in the network corresponding to a steady fock state in a given normal mode @xcite .",
    "finally , we stress that the scheme used in the present manuscript , as well as that in ref .",

    "other schemes to engineer selective transtions or quantum - scissors have also been reported @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting at this point to recall an early theoretical proposal to generate highly excited fock states from an initial coherent state prepared in the vibrational degrees of freedom of a trapped ion @xcite .",
    "in that scheme , the authors took only the relaxation mechanism of the electronic states into account .",
    "differently , in our proposal , we also consider the decay of the cavity mode in which the steady fock state is prepared ; in fact , we take advantage of this inevitable decay to produce our steady states , which are achieved irrespectively of the initial state of the cavity mode .",
    "we also note that various schemes have been presented to produce steady states in cavity qed and trapped ion , other than those mentioned above @xcite .",
    "these protocols rely on reservoir engineering schemes @xcite , feedback loops @xcite , and quasi - local control @xcite .",

    "we have also indicated how to generate , through a six - level atomic configuration , interactions confined to the fock subspaces ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath13 and @xmath5 to @xmath3 .",
    "next , turning to the applications of the derived @xmath9 hamiltonians confined to a subspace of states ranging from @xmath4 up to @xmath6 , we presented a method , relying on atomic reservoir engineering @xcite , for the protection of the higher energy state @xmath6 .",
    "focusing on the @xmath9 hamiltonian confined to the fock subspaces @xmath151 , we presented the evolution of the fidelity @xmath194 @xmath195 and mandel s @xmath191 factor , showing that the field reaches the steady state that indeed approaches the fock state @xmath13 .",
    "we then present a strategy following the reasoning in ref .",
    "@xcite , where engineered atomic reservoirs @xcite are also assumed to generate @xmath9 liouvillians , which does not rely on the engineering of a specific @xmath9 hamiltonian .",
    "the engineered liouvillian is then used to generate and protect states that approach closely the fock states @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the two schemes outlined above for the production of steady fock states have approximately the same effectiveness and difficulty of practical implementation .",
    "the engineering of @xmath9 hamiltonians and liouvillians becomes increasingly difficult as we increase the size of the @xmath9 subspace . while the engineering of @xmath9 interactions requires an increasing number of specific atomic levels and laser beams , the engineering of @xmath9 liouvillians demands the random selection of an increasing number of the subspaces @xmath235 .",
    "we finally observe that a number of distinct applications of the @xmath9 and sliced interactions we have engineered above can be implemented , such as the engineering of non - classical states , quantum logical gates , teleportation of superpositions of @xmath271 , etc .",
    "basically , what we have done in this contribution can be taken forward in the context of what have been called quantum - scissors for optical state truncation @xcite .",
    "as already stressed above , the technique here presented can be directly applicable , among others platforms , to circuit qed @xcite .",
