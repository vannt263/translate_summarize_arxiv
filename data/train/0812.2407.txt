    "there are three main reasons for revisiting soft @xmath4 high energy interactions at this time .",
    "* a. *  this paper is concerned with the description of the high energy behaviour of `` soft '' observables such as @xmath5 particle multiplicities etc . in terms of basic physics . this physics predated qcd and is sometimes regarded as the dark age of strong interactions . however , it is unfair to call this the dark age .",
    "we had a successful description of these processes in terms of the exchange of regge trajectories linked to particle states in the crossed channels @xcite .",
    "the dominant exchange at high energy is the pomeron , and we have gribov s reggeon calculus @xcite to account for the multi - pomeron contributions",
    ". however the available data did not reach high enough energy to distinguish between the different scenarios @xcite for the high - energy behaviour of the interaction amplitude @xcite .    in the `",
    "weak coupling ' scenario the total cross section @xmath6 , and in order not to violate unitarity , and to satisfy the inequality @xmath7 the triple - pomeron vertex must vanish when @xmath8 , that is the triple - pomeron coupling @xmath9 . in this case , the large logarithm coming from the integration over the mass of the system produced in diffractive dissociation ( @xmath10 ) is compensated by the small value of the mean momentum transferred through the pomeron , @xmath11 .    on the other hand , in the ` strong coupling ' scenario , where @xmath12 with @xmath13 , the inequality ( [ eq:1 ] ) is provided by a small value of the rapidity gap survival factor @xmath14 which decreases with energy .",
    "the present diffractive data are better described within the ` strong coupling ' approach @xcite , and in this paper we shall give predictions for the lhc for this scenario .",
    "however , the possibility of the ` weak coupling ' scenario is not completely excluded yet .",
    "therefore , it is quite important to study the different channels of diffractive dissociation at the lhc in order to reach a final conclusion and to fix the parameters of the model for high - energy soft interactions .",
    "so the first motivation is the intrinsic interest in obtaining a reliable , self - consistent model for soft interactions , which may be illuminated by data from the lhc @xcite .    *",
    "b. *   in turn , obtaining a reliable model will be of great value for predictions of the gross features of soft interactions . in particular , it is essential for understanding the structure of the underlying events at the lhc .    *",
    "c. *   the third reason for studying soft interactions arises because it may not be an easy task to identify the production of a new object at the lhc when it is accompanied by hundreds of other particles emitted in the same event . for the detailed study of the new object , @xmath15 , it may be better to select the few , very clean , events with the large rapidity gaps ( lrg ) on either side of the new object , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "that is to observe the exclusive process @xmath16 .",
    "in such a central exclusive process ( cep ) the mass of @xmath15 can be measured with very good accuracy ( @xmath17 gev ) by the missing - mass method by detecting the outgoing very forward protons . moreover",
    ", a specific @xmath18 selection rule @xcite reduces the background and also greatly simplifies the spin - parity analysis of @xmath15 .",
    "however , the cep cross section is strongly suppressed by the small survival factor , @xmath19 , of the rapidity gaps .",
    "thus we need a reliable model of soft interactions to evaluate the corresponding value of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is important to have a model which contains @xmath20-channel components of different size in order to evaluate the possible effects of the ` soft - hard factorisation ' breaking .",
    "this is the subject of the following paper @xcite .",
    "first , we briefly recall the relevant features of the single - channel eikonal model .",
    "that is , we focus on elastic unitarity . at high energy the position of the fast particle in the impact parameter , @xmath21 , plane is to a good approximation frozen during the interaction , since the value of @xmath21 is fixed by the orbital angular momentum @xmath22 of the incoming hadron .",
    "there is no mixture between the partial wave amplitudes with different @xmath23 .",
    "the well known solution of the elastic unitarity equation , 2 imt_el(s , b ) = |t_el(s , b)|^2 + g_inel(s , b ) , [ eq : a1 ] may be written in terms of the phase shift @xmath24 as @xmath25 the presence of inelastic channels , given by @xmath26 in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) , leads to the phase @xmath24 having an imaginary part .",
    "that is , @xmath24 becomes a complex number .",
    "moreover , at high energies we know that re@xmath27im@xmath28 is small .",
    "now , in the framework of the eikonal model , the elastic amplitude , t_el  =  i(1-e^-/2 ) is obtained by the sum of regge - exchange diagrams , which is equivalent to the iteration of the elastic unitarity equation , ( [ eq : a1 ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aa ] . in other words , @xmath29-channel elastic unitarity gives        t_el(s , b ) & = & 1-e^-/2 [ eq : elastamp ] + _ el(s , b ) & = & ( 1-e^-/2)^2 , [ eq : el ] + _ inel(s , b ) & = & 1- e^- , [ eq : inel ] where @xmath30 is called the opacity ( optical density ) or eikonal is called the eikonal . ] ; @xmath31 plays the role of @xmath32 .",
    "it is the fourier transform of the two - particle ( @xmath29-channel ) _ irreducible _ amplitude , @xmath33 .",
    "that is and @xmath34 to denote vectors in the transverse plane . ]",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 , and where the amplitude is normalized by the relation @xmath37 . from ( [ eq : inel ] ) , we see that @xmath38 is the probability that no inelastic scattering occurs at impact parameter @xmath21 .    after summing over @xmath21 ( that is , all partial waves )",
    "we obtain the total , elastic and inelastic cross sections _ tot & = & 2d^2b imt_el(s , b )  =  2d^2b  ( 1-e^-/2 ) [ eq : ot ] + _ el & = & d^2b|t_el(s , b)|^2  =  d^2b  ( 1-e^-/2)^2 + _ inel & = & d^2b  =  d^2b  ( 1-e^- ) .    below we neglect the imaginary part of @xmath39 , apart from the contribution of secondary reggeons to high - mass diffractive dissociation . at high energies , the ratio re@xmath40 is small , and can be evaluated via a dispersion relation .",
    "so much for elastic diffraction .",
    "now we turn to inelastic diffraction , which is a consequence of the _ internal structure _ of hadrons . besides the pure elastic two - particle intermediate states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aa ] , there is the possibility of proton excitation , @xmath41 . as a rule such excitations",
    "are not included in the opacity @xmath39 , but are treated separately .",
    "this is simplest to describe at high energies , where the lifetime of the fluctuations of the fast proton is large , @xmath42 , and during these time intervals the corresponding fock states can be considered as ` frozen ' .",
    "each constituent of the proton can undergo scattering and thus destroy the coherence of the fluctuations . as a consequence",
    ", the outgoing superposition of states will be different from the incident particle , and will most likely contain multiparticle states , so we will have _ inelastic _ , as well as elastic , diffraction .    to discuss inelastic diffraction , it is convenient to follow good and walker  @xcite , and to introduce states @xmath43 which diagonalize the @xmath44 matrix .",
    "such eigenstates only undergo elastic scattering . since there are no off - diagonal transitions , _",
    "j|t|_k= 0  jk , a state @xmath45 can not diffractively dissociate into a state @xmath46 .",
    "we have noted that this is not , in general , true for hadronic states , which are not eigenstates of the @xmath47-matrix , that is of @xmath44 . to account for the internal structure of the hadronic states , we have to enlarge the set of intermediate states , from just the single elastic channel , and to introduce a multichannel eikonal .",
    "we will consider such an example below , but first let us express the cross section in terms of the probability amplitudes @xmath48 of the hadronic process proceeding via the various diffractive eigenstates describes the probability that the diffractive eigenstate @xmath43 is not absorbed in the interaction .",
    "later we will see that the rapidity gap survival factors , @xmath14 , can be described in terms of such eikonal exponents . ]",
    "@xmath43 .",
    "let us denote the orthogonal matrix which diagonalizes @xmath49 by @xmath50 , so that [ eq : b3 ] imt = at^da^t _ j |t^d| _ k = t^d_k _ jk . [ eq : diag ] now consider the diffractive dissociation of an arbitrary incoming state [ eq : b4 ] | j = _",
    "k a_jk | _ k .",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude for this state satisfies [ eq : b5 ] j",
    "|im  t| j = _ k    @xmath51 and where the brackets of @xmath52 mean that we take the average of @xmath53 over the initial probability distribution of diffractive eigenstates . after the diffractive scattering described by @xmath54 , the final state @xmath55",
    "will , in general , be a different superposition of eigenstates from that of @xmath56 , which was shown in  ( [ eq : b4 ] ) . at high energies we may neglect the real parts of the diffractive amplitudes .",
    "then , for cross sections at a given impact parameter @xmath21 , we have [ eq : b6 ] & = & 2 j |t| j = 2 _ k |a_jk|^2 t^d_k = 2 t^d + & & + & = & | j |t| j |^2 = ( _ k |a_jk|^2 t^d_k ) ^2 = t^d ^2 + & & + & = & _ k | _ k |t| j",
    "|^2 = _ k |a_jk|^2 ( t^d_k)^2 = ( t^d)^2 .",
    "it follows that the cross section for the single diffractive dissociation of a proton , [ eq : b7 ] = ( t^d)^2 - t^d ^2 , is given by the statistical dispersion in the absorption probabilities of the diffractive eigenstates . here",
    "the average is taken over the components @xmath45 of the incoming proton which dissociates .",
    "if the averages are taken over the components of both of the incoming particles , then in ( [ eq : b7 ] ) we must introduce a second index on @xmath53 , that is @xmath57 , and sum over @xmath45 and @xmath58 . in this case",
    "the sum is the cross section for single and double dissociation .    at first sight , enlarging the number of eigenstates @xmath59 we may include even high - mass proton dissociation .",
    "however here we face the problem of double counting when the partons originating from dissociation of the beam and ` target ' initial protons overlap in rapidities .",
    "for this reason high - mass dissociation is usually described by `` enhanced '' multi - pomeron diagrams .",
    "the first and simplest is the triple - pomeron graph , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2lad ] below .",
    "the total and elastic proton - proton cross sections are usually described in terms of an eikonal model , which automatically satisfies @xmath29-channel elastic unitarity . to account for the possibility of excitation of the initial proton , that is for two - particle intermediate states with the proton replaced by @xmath60",
    ", we use the good - walker formalism @xcite . already at tevatron energies the absorptive correction to the elastic amplitude , due to elastic eikonal rescattering , is not negligible ; it is about @xmath61% in comparison with the simple one pomeron exchange .",
    "after accounting for low - mass proton excitations ( that is @xmath60 s in the intermediate states ) the correction becomes twice larger ( that is , about @xmath62% ) .",
    "indeed , the possibility of proton excitation means that we have to include additional inelastic channels which were not accounted for in the irredicible amplitude @xmath15 of ( [ eq : append9 ] ) .",
    "this enlarges the probability of absorption for the elastic channel , that is the effective opacity @xmath39 . in terms of the good - walker formalism",
    ", the stronger absorption follows from the inequality with @xmath63 .",
    "it follows that @xmath64 which , since the second term is negative , is less than @xmath65 . ]    _",
    "ke^-_k  <  _ ke^-_k , where we average over the diffractive ( good - walker ) eigenstates .",
    "next , in order to describe high - mass diffractive dissociation , @xmath66 , we have to include an extra factor of 2 from the agk cutting rules @xcite .",
    "thus , the absorptive effects in the triple - regge domain are expected to be quite large .",
    "the previous triple - regge analyses ( see , for example , @xcite ) did not allow for absorptive corrections and the resulting triple - regge couplings must be regarded , not as bare vertices , but as effective couplings embodying the absorptive effects @xcite . since the inelastic cross section ( and , therefore , the absorptive corrections ) expected at the lhc are more than twice as large as that observed at fixed - target and cern - isr energies , the old triple - regge vertices can not be used to predict the diffractive cross sections at the lhc .",
    "thus , it is necessary to perform a new triple - regge analysis that includes the absorptive effects explicitly .",
    "such an analysis has recently been performed @xcite using the fixed - target fnal , cern - isr and tevatron data that are available in the triple - regge region .",
    "the ` @xmath67 ' , ` @xmath68 ' , ` @xmath69 ' , ` @xmath70 ' and @xmath71 contributions , were included assuming either the ` strong ' or ` weak ' coupling scenarios for the behaviour of the triple - pomeron vertex . to account for the absorptive corrections a two - channel ( good - walker )",
    "eikonal model was used , which describes well the total , @xmath72 , and elastic , @xmath73 , @xmath4 and @xmath74 cross sections .    in the ` strong ' coupling case , a good @xmath75dof=167/(210 - 8)=0.83",
    "was obtained . in comparison with the old triple - regge analysis @xcite ,",
    "a twice larger relative contribution of the ` @xmath68 ' term was found .",
    "this is mainly due to the inclusion of the higher - energy tevatron data in the analysis .",
    "since the absorptive effects are included explicitly , the extracted values of the triple - reggeon vertices are now much closer to the _ bare _ triple - regge couplings .",
    "in particular , the value @xmath76 is consistent with a reasonable extrapolation of the perturbative bfkl pomeron vertex to the low scale region @xcite ; here @xmath77 is the pomeron - proton coupling .",
    "note also that these values of the ` @xmath67 ' and ` @xmath68 ' vertices allow a good description of the hera data @xcite on inelastic @xmath78 photoproduction , @xmath79 , where the screening corrections are rather small .",
    "the ` weak ' coupling scenario leads to a larger @xmath75dof=1.4 and to a worse description of the @xmath80 process at the lowest values of @xmath20 . at the lhc energy",
    "the ` weak ' coupling fit predicts about 3 times smaller inclusive cross section @xmath81 at @xmath82 and low @xmath20 in comparison with that predicted in the ` strong ' coupling case .",
    "note that the effects due to the triple - pomeron vertex ( [ eq:2 ] ) are rather large .",
    "indeed , the contribution caused by such vertices is enhanced by the logarithmically large phase space available in rapidity .",
    "in particular , the total cross section of high - mass dissociation is roughly with @xmath83 .",
    "] of the form _ sd  =  ~  s  _ el , where @xmath84 reflects the suppression of high - mass dissociation in comparison with elastic scattering and the ln@xmath29 factor comes from the integration @xmath85 .",
    "thus actually we deal with the parameter @xmath86 at collider energies . for each fixed rapidity interval",
    "the probability of high - mass dissociation ( or , in other words , the contribution due to the triple - pomeron vertex ) is relatively small .",
    "however the cumulative effect in the complete interaction amplitude is enhanced by the large phase space available in rapidity .    as a consequence ,",
    "the contribution of the corresponding , so - called ` enhanced ' , diagrams , with a few vertices , is not negligible .",
    "moreover , we can not expect that more complicated multi - pomeron interactions , driven by the @xmath87 vertices , which describe the transition of @xmath88 to @xmath89 pomerons of fig .",
    "[ fig : gnm ] , will not affect the final result .",
    "it looks more reasonable to assume that @xmath90 than to assume that @xmath91 for any @xmath92 .",
    "thus we need a model which accounts for the possibility of multi - pomeron interactions ( with arbitrary @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) .",
    "in this paper we extend and develop the _ partonic _ approach of ref .  @xcite . while the eikonal formalism describes the rescattering of the incoming fast particles , the enhanced multi - pomeron diagrams represent the rescattering of the intermediate partons in the ladder ( feynman diagram ) which describes the pomeron - exchange amplitude .",
    ".,height=113 ]    indeed , we start with the generation of ladder - type structure of ` elastic ' bare pomeron exchange amplitude",
    ". it may be generated by the evolution equation @xcite ( in rapidity , @xmath93 , space ) @xmath94 where @xmath21 is the two - dimensional vector in impact parameter space .",
    "@xmath95 is the probability to emit new intermediate partons ( denoted @xmath96 ) within unit rapidity interval ; it is analogous to the splitting function of dglap evolution .",
    "the impact parameter of parton @xmath96 is not frozen in the evolution . at each step",
    "@xmath21 can be changed by a constant amount @xmath97 in any direction , leading to the diffusion represented by the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq:3 ] ) where @xmath98 plays the role of the diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "the evolution is shown symbolically in fig .",
    "[ fig : dt ] .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq:3 ] ) is ( y , b)=_0(y - b^2/4 y)/4 y. [ eq : yb ] it represents the opacity ( at point @xmath99 ) , corresponding to the incoming particle placed at @xmath100 and @xmath101 .    it may be helpful to explain why ( [ eq:3 ] ) was written in terms of the opacity @xmath39 .",
    "first we note that the discontinuity of the amplitude generated by ( [ eq:3 ] ) does not contain a two - particle @xmath29-channel intermediate state ; it corresponds to a pure inelastic high multiplicity process , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mult ] . due to elastic unitarity , ( [ eq : a1 ] )",
    "this inelastic interaction leads to elastic @xmath4 scattering .",
    "thus we have to put the solution of ( [ eq:3 ] ) into the eikonal formulae of ( [ eq : elastamp])-([eq : inel ] ) , as it does not contain two - particle @xmath29-channel states .        in momentum space",
    "the solution ( [ eq : yb ] ) corresponds to the amplitude a(s , t )  =  a_0  s^1++ t. that is to the bare pomeron exchange amplitude , where the pomeron trajectory has intercept @xmath102 and slope @xmath98 .",
    "a multi - pomeron enhanced contribution arises from the absorption of intermediate @xmath29-channel partons @xmath96 during the evolution of @xmath39 in @xmath93 .",
    "the simplest example is the triple - pomeron diagram in which parton @xmath96 undergoes an extra rescattering with the target parton @xmath45 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2lad ] .        allowing for many rescatterings",
    ", we have to sum over different numbers of ladders between partons @xmath96 and @xmath45 .",
    "assuming an eikonal form for the multi - pomeron - proton vertex , it is natural to replace ( [ eq:3 ] ) by  =  e^-_k/2(+)_k(y , b ) [ eq : teik ] where the ` opacity ' @xmath103 describes the transparency of the target @xmath45 .",
    "as we are dealing with the elastic _ amplitude _ we use @xmath104 and not @xmath105 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath84 arises since parton @xmath96 will have a different absorption cross section from that of eigenstate @xmath58 .",

    "[ fig : gnm ] . even though @xmath108 , the role of the factor @xmath104 is not negligible , since the suppression effect is accumulated throughout the evolution .",
    "for instance , if @xmath109 the full absorptive correction is given by the product @xmath110 , where the small value of @xmath84 is compensated by the large rapidity interval @xmath111 .    in terms of regge diagrams , ( [ eq : teik ] )",
    "sums up the system of fan diagrams in which any number @xmath89 of `` lower '' pomerons couples to a fan vertex @xmath112 .",
    "such multi - pomeron diagrams are called `` enhanced '' , since their contribution is enhanced , in comparison with the eikonal diagrams , by the large available rapidity interval @xmath111 . in order to include",
    "the rescattering with the beam @xmath58 we replace ( [ eq : teik ] ) by @xmath113 the final term in the exponent is the opacity of the beam @xmath58 , which depends on the rapidity interval @xmath114 , with @xmath115 .",
    "the equation for the opacity @xmath116 has an analogous form @xmath117 in which we now evolve in the opposite direction starting from the boundary condition @xmath118 at @xmath119 .",
    "recall that the fit to the data in the triple - reggeon domain indicated a very small ( consistent with zero ) @xmath20-slope of all the triple - reggeon vertices @xcite .",
    "thus , as the size of the multi - reggeon vertices are negligible in comparison with the size of the incoming hadron , we may write the absorptive corrections ( that is , the exponential factors on the right - hand - side of ( [ eq:4],[eq:5 ] ) ) such that the opacities @xmath120 are taken at the same point in the impact parameter plane @xmath21 .",
    "since the intermediate parton may be absorbed by the interaction with the particles ( partons ) from the wave function of both the beam or target hadron , we now need to solve the two equations , ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "this is done iteratively .",
    "moreover , note that the opacities @xmath39 now depend on two vectors in impact parameter space - the separation @xmath121 between the position of the intermediate parton @xmath96 and the beam hadron , and the separation @xmath122 between @xmath96 and the target hadron .",
    "the argument @xmath21 in ( [ eq:4],[eq:5 ] ) now symbolically denotes both @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "a more detailed description of the amplitude , and the cross sections of the different diffractive processes can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , as in @xcite , we use three diffractive components in the @xmath29-channel . in other words ,",
    "we use a 3-channel eikonal for the rescattering of fast particles .",
    "the transverse size squared of each eigenstate is proportional to the corresponding absorptive cross section ; @xmath124 .",

    "the shape of the pomeron - nucleon vertex is parametrised by the form factor @xmath125 , whose fourier transform , @xmath126 , plays the role of the initial conditions for @xmath127 .",
    "however , now , we allow for a non - zero slope ( @xmath128 ) of the ( bare ) pomeron trajectory .    a major development , of the model of @xcite ,",
    "is that we use four different @xmath20-channel states , which we label @xmath50 : one for the secondary reggeon ( @xmath129 ) trajectory and three pomeron states ( @xmath130 ) to mimic the bfkl diffusion in the logarithm of parton transverse momentum , @xmath0 @xcite . to be precise ,",
