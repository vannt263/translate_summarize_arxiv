    "the question of how accretion onto a black hole occurs has been of great and ongoing interest .",
    "observations of accreting sources provide a test of astrophysics in the strong gravity regime and will potentially yield a signature of the presence of an event horizon around black holes .",
    "recent advances in x - ray technology have revealed that accretion can occur at extremely low rates across the range of black hole masses from stellar remnants to supermassive black holes at the centre of our own and other galaxies .",
    "however , the nature of that low - level accretion remains unclear ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accretion flows at low luminosities do appear to be radiatively inefficient , but we have yet to determine to what extent that arises from advection of hot gas through the event horizon , and what role jets may play in carrying away energy @xcite .",
    "these low - level accreting black holes emit across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to x - rays , so multiwavelength studies can be used to disentangle different sources from different regions of the inflow , outflow , or jet , and to establish causal connections between behavior in these regions .    among the stellar mass black hole population ,",
    "the best studied quiescent system for this purpose has been v404  cyg , which contains a compact object with a mass function of @xmath2m@xmath3 @xcite  one of the most secure stellar mass black hole mass determinations we have .",
    "v404  cyg  has the longest orbital period of the black hole x - ray transients ( bhxrts ) , at 6.5days , with a k0iv companion star @xcite .",
    "it is also the most luminous stellar mass black hole in quiescence with @xmath4ergs@xmath5 , @xmath6 brighter than the prototypical bhxrt , a062000 @xcite .",
    "these extremes are unlikely to be coincidental and the high @xmath7 may be a consequence of the long orbital period , the evolved donor star , and/or the high mass of the black hole .    attempts to relate observations of quiescent black hole binaries to theoretical models of accretion flows have focused upon fitting the broad - band spectral energy distribution , ideally with coverage from radio to x - ray energies .",
    "v404  cyg  has been a prime target due to its x - ray brightness @xcite .",
    "these studies mainly focused on pure accretion models and only considered the optical to x - ray regime , as radio data were limited or non - existent .",
    "attempts to apply advective models to the more luminous hard state ( e.g.  @xcite ) brought home the fact that these models could not explain the ubiquitous radio emission in this state , that was sometimes seen to extend as far as the near - ir band . a more complete description of the low - state sed appears to require a coupled accretion plus outflow model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more recent studies have revealed significant radio emission in quiescence too , from v404  cyg  @xcite , and from a062000 @xcite providing support to the idea that an outflow also plays a significant role in quiescence .    to facilitate comparison between developing models and data we present here the most complete sed available for v404  cyg .",

    "we performed photometry using the idl / astrolib aperture photometry routine aper .",
    "as v404  cyg is faint we used a relatively small aperture to perform photometry , of radius 0.125 , with background defined by a 2.5  annulus .",
    "no stars in the field were bright enough to determine per - field aperture corrections , so we use the tabulated values from @xcite .",
    "this aperture collects about 75%  of the total light , and almost all of the sharp core of the point spread function .",
    "we measured the position of the target in the f330w bandpass and then fixed it for f250w , after verifying that it was consistently placed in the two .",
    "we note in passing that we do detect both v404  cyg  and the nearby contaminating star .",
    "we find an offset of the contaminating star relative to v404  cyg  of @xmath8sec ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 , an improvement on the relative astrometry of the stars compared to that reported by @xcite .",
    "a significant source of systematic uncertainty in acs photometry is charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) due to radiation damage to the ccds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , although fortunately the observations were performed early enough in the lifetime of acs that cti is unlikely to be a severe problem .",
    "the effect is worst at low light levels , so maximised for faint uv sources .",
    "cti is also least well calibrated for these cases , and the correction prescriptions provided by @xcite formally diverge for negligible sky background or source counts .",
    "we face both problems with these data .",
    "sky backgrounds in the near - uv are extremely low , dominated by zodiacal light and earthshine in the f330w bandpass , and geo - coronal emission at shorter wavelengths .",
    "both were essentially unmeasurable in our images , and the background is expected to be dominated by ccd dark current , producing 0.52.0e@xmath11/pixel for our exposures .",
    "we attempted to estimate the cti losses in two ways .",
    "firstly , we followed the prescription in @xcite , except that we used the estimated background ( including the dominant dark current term ) from the acs exposure time calculator .",
    "this prescription predicted losses of @xmath12% .",
    "based on the actual data shown by @xcite however , this prescription appears to overestimate the cti losses for the faintest sources . for the low background case ( 0.51.5e@xmath11/pixel ) at source brightnesses up to a few hundred electrons",
    ", @xcite found losses of around 0.035mag at maximum distance from the readout amplifier .",
    "if we rescale this to the times of our observations and positions of the source we expect losses of about 2.5% .",
    "we use these latter estimates to correct our measured source brightnesses and assign an additional error estimate of 2.5%  to account for the uncertainty in applying cti corrections .",
    "the uncertainties in the cti corrections are much smaller than the statistical uncertainties in the measured fluxes , so this is not the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "we tabulate our photometric results in table  [ hstphottable ] .",
    "since we are measuring counts across a broad bandpass rather than monochromatic fluxes , we tabulate the data in two ways ; the corrected number of electrons per second , and the average flux per unit wavelength using photometric zero - points estimated by the acs pipeline .",

    "seeing conditions were not good enough to cleanly separate the contribution of the target and its nearby ( 1.4 ) line - of - sight star @xcite so we applied straightforward aperture photometry using a large aperture of 3.5which adds the flux from both stars as described by @xcite .",
    "we determine an average magnitude @xmath19 in acceptably close agreement with @xcite , indicating little difference in the optical brightness of the system compared to earlier data .      to reconstruct the optical sed of the source we use the wht data from the program .",

    "we found an offset between the two , most likely due to systematic errors in the wht calibration . since the iac80 photometry agrees well with earlier measures we assume that this calibration is correct and rescaled the wht data up by a factor of 1.3 to agree with the iac80 @xmath18 band data .",
    "we used additional optical spectroscopy obtained with the r831 grating and standard eev ccds of the gmos spectrograph on gemini - n to extend our continuum lightcurve .",

    "these points do raise some concern that they were taken soon after the outburst and may not be fully quiescent .",
    "there is also a large gap , 13 years , relative to the recent data .",
    "nonetheless , we find excellent agreement in @xmath18 between our simultaneous iac80 photometry and the earlier data .",

    "we note that in both cases this contamination is effectively negligible in comparison to other uncertainties .",
    "we expect the optical emission in quiescent bhxrts to be a combination of light from the disc and light from the companion star . in the case of v404  cyg ,",
    "this is overwhelmingly dominated by the companion .",

    "@xcite investigated several methods of fitting the veiling at different wavelengths within the optical spectrum . despite large uncertainties in their results ,",

    "we can not make a reliable determination of the disc fraction from our low resolution spectroscopy , but can instead use a different method to place a lower limit on the disc fraction .",
    "the optical continuum is significantly variable , and the variability presumably must be attributed to the disc .",
    "if we assume that the optical continuum lightcurve consists of three components : companion star , slowly varying disc light , and flickering disc light , then the fraction of light due to the flickering component provides a robust lower limit on the disc fraction .",
    "we show iac80 photometry together with wht and gemini continuum lightcurves in fig .",
    "[ optvarfig ] .",
    "our observations were centred around photometric phase 0.65 using the ephemeris of @xcite implying that the ellipsoidal modulation should be rising from the deeper minimum at phase 0.5 to the maximum at phase 0.75 .",
    "this rising trend and the approximate amplitude of ellipsoidal modulations expected are consistent with the general upward trend we observe . for a long period system such as v404  cyg , we can approximate the ellipsoidal modulation within a night by a linear trend so we remove the slowly varying light by subtracting a linear fit to the lower envelope of the continuum lightcurve .",
    "we find that the remaining flickering component is about 4percent of the total light in both the wht and gemini segments of the lightcurve and correlates very well with the x - ray variations ( as also found for the h@xmath29 emission by @xcite ) .",
    "this 4%  flickering light is actually not far off of spectroscopic estimates based on veiling near h@xmath29 as discussed above .",
    "this makes it plausible that flickering light source does contribute most of the disc light in the optical .",
    "we do not have sufficient information to independently constrain the stellar contribution to the sed at each wavelength , so opt to instead model the stellar spectrum based on estimates of the system parameters .",

    "we tested this by fitting the model k0iii spectrum described above to the full set of bvrjhk magnitudes ( folding the model spectrum with bandpasses to generate synthetic photometry ) constraining the fit to preferably lie within ranges implied by the disc contamination constraints of @xcite and @xcite and shown in fig .",

    "[ optfitfig ] .",
    "the residuals scatter both above and below the line indicating that intrinsic variability and/or calibration uncertainties are playing a role , so we do not attempt to estimate an error on the extinction but we do show companion spectra reddened by @xmath47 and @xmath43 to indicate the sensitivity to extinction .",
    "extinctions much outside of this range would require attributing a larger fraction of the light to the disc than has previously been estimated .    the alternate g8 and k2 possibilities are almost indistinguishable from k0 , so we do not show them .",

    "such a disc would remain a possibility in the light of our uv observations as it would not contribute to the uv flux .    the difficulty in fitting the 24@xmath28 m point supports a more controversial interpretation as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the flux in this band is rather close to an extrapolation of the flat radio spectrum raising the possibility that the ir excess could be due to synchrotron jet emission .",
    "the major difficulty in quantifying this is that the radio is known to be strongly variable ( section  [ radiosection ] ) and was not observed simultaneously with the 24@xmath28 m point .",
    "we will return to this topic in section  [ jetsection ] .",
    "our data also provide tenuous evidence for a uv excess .",

    "the estimates for red - leaks from @xcite are of no use as they only consider unreddened stars , so we perform our own calculations .",
    "in addition to red - leaks , because the spectrum is so steep in the uv it is hard to gauge the expected flux in a broad - band without performing synthetic photometry .    to better assess the significance of any uv excess",
    ", we therefore use synphot @xcite to estimate count - rates in each bandpass for our model reddened k0iii spectrum .",
    "we consider two spectra , one with the full spectral coverage , and the other truncated above 4200  to disentangle in - band stellar flux from the red - leak .",
    "we find that the red - leak is negligible in the f330w bandpass , as expected , and that the in - band stellar flux can account for approximately half of the count - rate seen in this band ; this is a little more than a 3@xmath51 excess .",
    "the f250w band appears to have a large contribution from red - leak , about half of the flux in the band .",
    "after subtraction of the companion star , both in - band and red - leak , the residual excess is @xmath52s@xmath5 , so is not a significant detection of disc light in this band .",
    "we therefore appear to have a significant detection of a uv excess in the f330w band only , but even this is at the mercy of uncertainties in the companion spectral classification ( which do become a concern in the uv ) and reddening .",

    "we separated the data into two bandpasses of approximately equal count rates , which were 0.31.75kev ( soft ) and 1.757.0kev ( hard ) for each set . to account for the reduction in sensitivity between the two epochs",
    ", we used an assumed fixed model of a photo - absorbed power - law to calculate the ratio of expected count rates in these bandpasses between the two observations and hence rescale the 2000 observations to match those from 2003 . the resulting hardness ",
    "intensity diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ colorintensityfig ] .",
    "we see no variation in hardness either within or between the two observations , the first of which had a substantially higher count rate .",
    "this indicates no detectable spectral change over a factor of ten in source luminosity .",
    "to constrain the radio spectral shape we first examine each dataset individually .",
    "we obtain @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 ) from the vla data and @xmath72 from the wsrt .",
    "the difference between them is not statistically significant so we also perform a joint power - law fit to both datasets , allowing the relative normalisation of the two to vary as they sample different portions of the lightcurve .",
    "primarily this is constrained by the vla data as the uncertainties in the wsrt fluxes are larger .",
    "we find a spectral index of @xmath73 .",
    "all the fits are consistent with the canonical flat spectrum as commonly seen in hard state black hole binaries .",
    "the vla data exhibit substantial variability .",
    "we show the higher quality 8.5ghz lightcurve together with that from _ chandra _ in fig .",
    "[ optvarfig ] .",
    "the radio is clearly strongly variable and shows both large flares and dips not dissimilar to those seen by _ chandra_. the most dramatic feature rises from almost zero flux to the highest peak in about 30min , as was also the case in the dataset presented by @xcite .",
    "no clear correlation between radio and x - ray is apparent to the eye , however .",
    "to further test this , we calculate the cross - correlation function between the x - ray and radio data and show this in fig .",
    "[ ccffig ] . no compelling correlation ( or anti - correlation ) is present although an unremarkable peak is present at zero lag .     and @xmath74 expectations for uncorrelated variations .",
    "]    since wsrt is a linear array , it covers a full synthesis in 12 hours and hence is not capable of the high time - resolution achieved by the vla .",
    "nevertheless the source does show significant variability over this period , even if a possible correlation with x - ray / optical is difficult to infer .",
    "when the observation is split in 2 sub - intervals , 18:4024:00 and 00:0005:13 , the resulting flux densities are : @xmath75mjy and @xmath76mjy respectively . the second interval , covering d2f2 , overlaps with the first part of the vla observation , which shows a significant increase at 8.5ghz beginning at 03:00 ut ( with a peak flux density of 0.6mjy ) .",
    "however , the vla flare only lasts for @xmath77 hour , of which only about one - half was covered by wsrt .",
    "finer sub - intervals proved impractical as there was insufficient coverage of the uv plane to isolate flux from v404  cyg .",
    "previous sections of this paper have focused primarily on one or two bands ; we will broaden our scope here to questions best addressed with the whole sed .",
    "we show the complete radio  x - ray sed in fig .",
    "[ sedfig ] .",
    "we have also compiled all the data points , as plotted , in table  [ datatable ] to allow easier comparison with future models .",
    "we include a point representing just the flickering component in the optical to represent a lower limit on the accretion light .",
    "we adopt the extinction curve of @xcite in the optical and uv , @xcite for the _ spitzer_/irac data and assume @xmath78 following @xcite .",
    "our dataset should supersede that used by @xcite for future modelling of v404  cyg .",
    "compared to earlier work we now have simultaneous x - ray and optical data , shorter wavelength coverage extending into the near - uv , and simultaneous radio observations .    in fig .",
    "[ adaffig ] we illustrate the additional constraints now possible , showing model 1 of @xcite overlaid on our sed after scaling downwards to fit our x - ray spectrum .",
    "this is of course not intended to be a detailed model fit .",
    "not only should a new model be computed to fit a lower x - ray luminosity , but there have been refinements in modelling of advective accretion flows in the last decade as well .",
    "our main point is to stress the strong constraint provided by the low near - uv flux .",
    "model 1 was an acceptable fit to the sed data available to @xcite but clearly over - predicts the near - uv substantially compared to our new data .",
    "alternative models with winds presented by @xcite , on the other hand , would be consistent with the uv data .",
    "this constraint on the uv to x - ray flux ratio can be used to constrain current and future models .",
    "the flux of the optical flickering component falls at an intriguing location in the sed ( fig .",
    "[ sedfig ] ) .",
    "it is a little above a straight extrapolation of either the x - ray or radio power - laws .",
    "an extrapolation of the radio is plausible , as a flat - spectrum is expected to continue until a break to optically thin synchrotron at higher frequencies .",
    "we would not expect a straight extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum at all , and all models for the broad - band sed ( e.g.  @xcite ) involve curvature between x - ray and optical bands . ) here correlations are more telling evidence than fluxes .",
    "we find an excellent correlation between x - ray and optical continuum ( fig .",
    "[ optvarfig ] ) , but no clear correlation between x - ray and radio ( and by extension optical ) .",
    "this suggests that the optical variability and the x - ray emission are closely connected , either by direct emission from the same region , as expected from early advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models , or indirectly through x - ray irradiation of the disc , as inferred for h@xmath29 emission by @xcite . the x - ray and radio emission , on the other hand , do not obviously appear correlated on the timescales observed ( although a correlation on longer timescales is certainly possible ) suggesting that the mechanisms for variability in the two are not connected .",
    "there is clearly a mid - ir excess prominent in the 24@xmath28 m band . while it is possible to partially explain this with emission from a cool disc , synchrotron emission from the radio jet provides a better description of the excess @xcite .",
    "an extrapolation of the flat spectrum beyond the ir region is problematic for several reasons .",
    "we have argued above that the optical variability appears directly or indirectly associated with the x - ray emitting component rather than with the radio .",
    "in addition , the low uv flux observed is inconsistent with a straight extrapolation of the flat spectrum all the way to the uv , and problematic even if the spectrum is assumed to break in the optical .",
    "this argues that a break in the jet spectrum at longer wavelengths is needed so that the non - stellar optical / uv emission originates from the disc rather than the jet .",
    "the most likely interpretation is then that the break from flat spectrum to optically thin synchrotron occurs in the mid to far - ir , although given the large amplitude of radio variability only simultaneous radio and mid - ir observations could address this question conclusively .",
    "we have compiled the comprehensive dataset describing the spectral energy distribution of the black hole x - ray binary v404  cyg  in quiescence .",
    "this includes new and simultaneous radio , optical , uv , and x - ray data , supplemented with additional non - simultaneous data in the optical through infrared .",
    "our specific findings are :    1 .",
    "there is no need for a model to include a substantial contribution from accretion light over the near - uv to optical spectral range .",
    "the sed over this range ( including the vacuum uv ) is well described by a k0iv star reddened by @xmath79 .",
    "the very low uv flux detected only marginally supports an accretion component , and rather tightly constrains some spectral models of quiescent accretion flows .",
    "2 .   as suggested by @xcite no plausible companion spectrum and interstellar extinction can fully explain the mid - ir ; an ir excess from a cool disc or possibly a jet @xcite appears to be required .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is consistent with a @xmath0 power - law as found by all other studies to date .",
    "there is no evidence for any spectral variation over the range of a factor of 10 in luminosity that has been observed over two epochs by chandra .",
    "the radio shows a flat spectrum in @xmath1 as is commonly seen in hard state x - ray binaries and associated with a compact jet .",
    "the break frequency between a flat and optically thin spectrum most likely occurs in the sub - mm to far - ir regime , but is not conclusively constrained by existing data .",
    "the radio is substantially variable but puzzlingly there is no clear correlation with x - ray variability .",
    "if the radio variability reflects changes in the jet power , this suggests that the x - ray variations occur independently of changes in the jet , or with a very large lag ( many hours ) between the two .",
    "overall , the likely interpretation of the sed is as follows :    1 .",
    "the k0iii companion star dominates the light from near - ir to near - uv wavelengths . 2 .",
    "the cool outer regions of the accretion disc may produce a modest mid - ir excess seen by _ spitzer _",
    "3 .   the inner accretion flow produces highly variable x - ray emission but apparently only weak uv emission .",
    "this irradiates the accretion disc and is responsible for emission line variability @xcite .",
    "the optical continuum variability may also arise from reprocessing but direct emission from the inner accretion flow remains a possibility .",
    "a compact jet is driven from the inner accretion disc producing variable flat - spectrum radio emission likely extending to the far and possibly mid - ir .",
    "the size of the jet is smaller than 4.5au ( about @xmath80 the binary separation ) for a distance of 3.5kpc @xcite .",
