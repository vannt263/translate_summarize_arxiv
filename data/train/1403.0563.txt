    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum hall effect @xcite is among the early examples of topological states of matter whose magnetic band structure is characterized by the first chern number @xcite . later on , quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) insulators were proposed with bloch band structures @xcite .",
    "insulators with nontrivial band topology were also generalized into time - reversal ( tr ) invariant systems , termed topological insulators ( tis ) in both 2d and 3d , which have become a major research focus in contemporary condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the topological index of tr invariant tis is no longer just integer valued , but @xmath12 valued , in both 2d and 3d @xcite . in 4d , it is the integer - valued second chern number @xcite .",
    "various 2d and 3d ti materials were predicted theoretically and observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "they exhibit gapless helical 1d edge modes and 2d surface modes through transport and spectroscopic measurements .",
    "solid state materials with the honeycomb lattice structure ( e.g. , graphene ) are another important topic of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "there are several proposals of qah model in the honeycomb lattice@xcite . as a tr invariant doublet of haldane s qah model @xcite ,",
    "the celebrated 2d kane - mele model was originally proposed in the context of graphene - like systems with the @xmath13 band .",
    "however , the atomic level spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in graphene does not directly contribute to opening the topological band gap @xcite .",
    "because of the single band structure and the lattice symmetry , the band structure so coupling is at the level of a high - order perturbation theory and thus is tiny .",
    "recently , the @xmath0- and @xmath1-orbital physics in the honeycomb lattice has been systematically investigated in the context of ultracold - atom optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the optical potential around each lattice potential minimum is locally harmonic .",
    "the @xmath6- and @xmath7-orbital bands are separated by a large band gap , and thus the hybridization between them is very small .",
    "the @xmath13-orbital band can also be tuned to high energy by imposing strong laser beams along the @xmath14 direction .",
    "consequently , we can have an ideal @xmath0- and @xmath1-orbital system in the artificial honeycomb optical lattice .",
    "such an orbitally active system provides a great opportunity to investigate the interplay between nontrivial band topology and strong correlations , which is fundamentally different from graphene @xcite .",
    "its band structure includes not only dirac cones but also two additional narrow bands which are exactly flat in the limit of vanishing @xmath15 bonding . inside the flat bands , due to the vanishing kinetic energy scale , nonperturbative strong correlation effects appear , such as the wigner crystallization of spinless fermions @xcite and ferromagnetism @xcite of spinful fermions as _ exact _ solutions .",
    "very recently , the honeycomb lattice for polaritons has been fabricated @xcite .",
    "both the dirac cone and the flat dispersion for the @xmath16 orbital bands have been experimentally observed .",
    "the band structure can be further rendered topologically nontrivial by utilizing the existing experimental technique of the on - site rotation around each trap center @xcite .",
    "this provides a natural way to realize the qah effect ( qahe ) as proposed in refs . and , and the topological gaps are just the rotation angular velocity @xcite . in the mott - insulating states ,",
    "the frustrated orbital exchange can be described by a novel quantum 120@xmath17 model @xcite , whose classic ground states map to all the possible loop configurations in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the @xmath0- and @xmath1-orbital structure also enables unconventional @xmath18-wave cooper pairing even with conventional interactions exhibiting flat bands of zero energy majorana edge modes along boundaries parallel to gap nodal directions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0- and @xmath1-orbital structures have also been studied very recently in several classes of solid state semiconducting materials including fluoridated tin film @xcite , functionalized germanene systems @xcite , bi@xmath19/sb@xmath19 ( @xmath19=h , f , cl , br ) systems @xcite , and in organic materials @xcite .",
    "all these materials share the common feature of the active @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals in the honeycomb lattice , enabling a variety of rich structures of topological band physics .",
    "the most striking property is the prediction of the large topological band gap which can even exceed room temperature .    in the literature ,",
    "a common mechanism giving rise to topological band gaps is the band inversion , which typically applies for two bands with different orbital characters , say , the @xmath6-@xmath7 bands .",
    "however , although band inversion typically occurs in systems with strong so coupling , the so coupling does not directly contribute to the value of the gap .",
    "the band inversion would lead to gap closing at finite momenta in the absence of the @xmath6-@xmath7 hybridization , and the @xmath6-@xmath7 hybridization reopens the gap whose nature becomes topological .",
    "the strength of the hybridization around the @xmath4 point linearly depends on the magnitude of the momenta , in the spirit of the @xmath20 perturbation theory , which is typically small .",
    "this is why in usual topological insulators based on band inversion , in spite of considerable so coupling strengths , the topological gap values are typically small . on the other hand , as for the single band systems in the honeycomb lattice such as graphene , the effect from the atomic level so coupling to the band structure",
    "is also tiny , as a result of the high - order perturbation theory .    in the model presented in this paper , here are only @xmath7 orbitals . the two - sublattice structure and the @xmath16-orbital configuration together",
    "greatly enhance the effect of so coupling , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] .",
    "the atomic - scale so coupling directly contributes to the opening of the topological gap at the @xmath21 point between bands 2 and 3 , and that at the @xmath4 point between bands 1 and 2 . since the atomic so",
    "coupling can be very large , the topological band gap can even reach the level of @xmath22 according to the estimation in ref ..    in this article , we construct a minimal four - band model to analyze the topological properties based on the @xmath0- and @xmath1-orbital structure in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the eigen energy spectra and wave functions can be analytically solved with the help of clifford @xmath4 matrices .",
    "the atomic so coupling lifts the degeneracy between two on - site kramers pairs with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . as explained in the preceding paragraph",
    ", the topological gap in this class of systems is extraordinary large . in the weak and intermediate regime of spin - orbit coupling strength ,",
    "the topological gaps are the global gap .",
    "the lattice asymmetry and the so coupling provide two different gap opening mechanisms , and their competition leads to a variety of topological band structures . with the introduction of both the sublattice anisotropy and the nel exchange field ,",
    "the system can become a large gap qah insulator .",
