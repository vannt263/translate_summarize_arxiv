    "in the last years , there has been a lot of interest in the description of electron - nucleus collisions at high energies .",
    "the results of current analysis show that future electron - nucleus colliders at hera and rhic , probably could determine whether parton distributions saturate and constraint the behavior of the nuclear gluon distribution in the full kinematical range @xcite .",

    "the photonuclear cross sections are given by the convolution between the photon flux from one of the nuclei and the cross section for the scattering photon - nuclei .",
    "the expression for the production of a given final state @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions is then given by , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the c.m.s energy of the nucleus - nucleus system and @xmath8 is the lorentz boost of a single beam .",

    "what follows , we perform phenomenology on heavy quarks and vector mesons production using the available high energy approaches .",
    "for our further analysis on photonuclear production of heavy quarks we will consider distinct high energy approaches , which are contrasted against the collinear approach @xcite : ( i ) semihard formalism , ( ii ) saturation model ( within the color dipole formalism ) and ( iii ) color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach .",
