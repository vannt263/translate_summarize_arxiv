    "since the launch of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton x - ray telescopes , the on - board high resolution x - ay spectrometers open a new window of studying the interstellar medium ( ism ) in our galaxy .",
    "numerous absorption features , produced by metal species with ionization stages ranging form neutral to hydrogen - like , were detected in the x - ray spectra of bright background sources such as the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and galactic x - ray binaries ( xrb ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . due to the distance constraint , most xrbs can only probe the ism within the galactic disk , while agns can help study the ism that may distribute beyond the disk and extend into the galactic halo .",
    "agn study of the milky way ism , however , is constrained by the brightness of background sources .",
    "the most prominent absorption line produced by highly ionized metals at @xmath0 is the k@xmath4 transition at 21.6  .  so far ,",
    "only a handful of targets are bright enough to detect other absorption line features , especially the crucial k@xmath5 transition at 18.63  ,  and enable the diagnose of the x - ray absorbing gas using high resolution x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "mkn  421 , pks  2155 and 3c  273 are the three brightest extragalactic x - ray sources that have been repeatedly observed with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton . despite sampling very different directions of mkn  421 and pks  2155 - 304",
    ", the two sightlines display a very similar distribution of hot gas ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray observation of the 3c  273 sightline , on the other hand , showed a quite different picture .",
    "previous studies indicated that the detected k@xmath4 line ew along the 3c  273 sightlinee is about twice higher ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . by comparing with the mkn  421 sightline , @xcite concluded that the x - ray emission / absorption along the 3c  273 sightline line is enhanced by a galactic central soft x - ray enhancement ( gcsxe ) component .",
    "-2 cm    0.4 cm [ f1 ]    the sightline toward 3c  273 passes through part of the sky that is enriched with supernova ( sn ) activities ( see the next section for details ) .",
    "furthermore , since the early work of @xcite , two giant gamma - ray bubbles (  fermi bubbles \" , see @xcite ) were discovered in the galactic center , and the 3c  273 sightline passes through the edge of the northern bubble .",
    "also , new data from both x - ray emission and absorption observations along this sightline were collected .",
    "our goal of this paper is therefore to investigate the role of the galactic structures along the 3c  273 sightline by making use of the latest data .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  2 we give a detailed description of the galactic structures along the 3c  273 sightline .",
    "we perform the _ chandra _ data reduction and analysis in section  3 . in section",
    " 4 we discuss the implication of our results by combining the results from the x - ray absorption observations with those from uv and x - ray emission observations .",
    "last section is summary and discussion .",
    "the 3c  273 sightline passes through several complicated galactic structures ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most prominent structures in the radio continuum sky is the giant radio loops that covers a significant fraction of the sky .",
    "these radio loops are believed to be the superbubble structures created by a series of sn explosion .",
    "the 3c  273 sightline passes through the edges of two known radio loops , the loop i and iv ( see figure  [ f1 ] for details ) .",
    "loop i and iv are the result of a series of such explosions in the sco - cen ob association ( @xcite ) , and are about @xmath6 and 210 pc away , respectively . in figure  [ f1 ]",
    "we plot the _ rosat _ @xmath7 kev all - sky survey map in the galactic coordinate @xcite . the origin and location of the prominent x - ray feature , the north polar spur ( nps ) , are still unclear .",
    "it has been suggested that the nps could be the result of the loop i superbubble colliding with the local hot bubble ( lhb ) surrounding the sun ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , or a more distant phenomenon near the galactic central region ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , two large gamma - ray bubbles (  _ fermi _ bubbles \" ) , along with several large scale structures , were discovered in the _ fermi_-lat data ( @xcite , see our figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the giant northern bubble extends to @xmath8 ( @xmath9 10 kpc ) above the galactic plane , with a width of @xmath10 along the longitude direction .",
    "next to the bubble is the northern arc ( the two cyan dotted lines ) that extends from @xmath11 to nearly 60@xmath12 and coincides with the prominent nps feature in x - ray .",
    "_ fermi _ data also revealed a giant , loop - shape structure that aligns with the radio loop i and iv .",
    "recent studies indicated that the nps may be related to the _ fermi _ bubbles , in particular , the northern arc ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the 3c  273 sightline passes right through the outer loop - shape structure as well as part of the region that may associate with the northern arc and nps .",
    "this sightline also passes through a region that is fairly close to the edge of the _ fermi _ bubbles .",

    "xmm_-newton for a combination of high spectral resolution and reasonable sensitivities . in particularly , for _ chandra _ we analyzed the data obtained with the medium energy gratings ( meg ) and low energy gratings ( leg ) , with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) as the focal plane detector ; for _ xmm_-newton we focused on the reflecting grating spectrometer unit 1 ( rgs1 ) ; the other rgs unit , rgs2 , has a failed ccd in the crucial line region , so we did not use the data taken by rgs2 .    between 2000 and 2012",

    ", we also combined the 12 hetg observations and the 6 letg observations to construct one meg and one leg spectrum .    for _ xmm_-newton between the same period , 20 observations of 3c  273 were performed with a total exposure of 769 @xmath29 .",
    "standard data reduction process was applied using the _ xmm_-newton data analysis software sas , version 12.0.1 .",
    "we filtered periods that were impacted by high background events . due to the large variation of the rgs1 response matrix between different observations",
    ", we can not co - add all the data sets in a way that we adopted for the _ chandra _ data sets .",

    "we clearly detected highly ionized and k - series ( k@xmath4 , k@xmath5 ) , and k@xmath4 transitions .",
    "for k@xmath4 and k@xmath5 transitions , we simultaneously fitted the leg , meg and rgs1 data with a voigt profile - based line model . due to a failed ccd in rgs1 around the line region and bad pixels presented in the rgs1",
    "spectra around the k@xmath4 region , for these two ion species we used the _ chandra _ data only .",
    "the free parameters for this model are the line column density ( @xmath33 ) , the doppler-@xmath34 parameter , and the redshift of the line center wavelength ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .",
    "we also tied all these parameters together for the same ion but different transitions . in table  1",

    "the line @xmath35 of an absorption line depends jointly on the ion column density and the doppler-@xmath34 parameter . in figure  [ f2 ]",
    "we show the column density vs doppler-@xmath34 contour plot of the k@xmath4 line of 3c  273 , as well as the comparison with other work .",
    "@xcite studied a subset of the _ chandra _ data that we analyzed in this paper . while our results are largely consistent with theirs , compared with a total of @xmath37 exposure in their work , better photon statistics has significantly improved the constraints on the key physical parameters .",
    "the measured 1@xmath38 range of the doppler-@xmath34 parameter is @xmath39 for mkn  421 @xcite and @xmath40 for pks  2155 - 304 @xcite .",
    "the column density in @xcite is somewhat lower than that of @xcite , and we refer readers to @xcite for a detailed discussion of the likely causes . we find that while for these three sight - lines the column densities are similar on the order of @xmath41 , the doppler-@xmath34 parameter of 3c  273 , @xmath42 , is significantly higher than those of pks  2155 - 304 and mkn  421 , leading to a much higher line @xmath35 .",
    "we now investigate the physical conditions of the x - ray absorber .",
    "a pure photoionization model is unlikely : past modeling suggests that the observed column densities would require a typical intergalactic environment in which the path length of the absorber would be at @xmath9 mpc level ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we also consider the cases of collisional ionization .",
    "we adopted the ionization fractions calculated by @xcite , and that temperature of the x - ray absorber can be nicely constrained at a narrow range between @xmath43 k @xmath44 k , regardless the metal abundance and whether or not the gas is in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that assuming purely thermal broadening , this temperature would indicate a line width of @xmath45 , or @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the atomic weight .",
    "this line width is fully consistent with the measurements of the mkn  421 and pks  2155 - 304 absorbers , implying the x - ray absorbers along these two sightlines are most likely thermally broadened ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for 3c  273",
    ", the large doppler-@xmath34 parameter suggests that non - thermal broadening plays a significant role .",
    "since @xmath48 , we derived a non - thermal velocity of @xmath49 .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed over thousands of _",
    "xmm_-newton observations and measured the and emission line intensities along these sightlines . in their sample , we select two pointings that are spatially close to the 3c  273 sightline , and use jointly the x - ray emission and absorption data to derive the physical properties of the x - ray absorber .",
    "the two pointings are located at @xmath50 ( _ xmm _ obs i d : 0110990201 ) , and @xmath51 ( _ xmm _ obs i d : 0203170301 ) , about 1@xmath12 and 3@xmath12 away from the 3c  273 sightline , respectively .",

    "@xmath57 is the electron density , and @xmath59 is the size of the absorber .",
    "we also assume a solar abundance .",
    "@xcite measured the emission line strength for these two pointings to be @xmath61 and @xmath62 l.u .",
    ", respectively .",
    "adopting the above estimated values , we find the predicted emission line intensity is @xmath63 l.u . ,",
    "consistent with results from @xcite .",
    "we also estimate an column density of @xmath64 .",
    "this is slightly larger than what we observed , but not by much .",

    "note that they adopted 90% error range .",
    "we also plot the contour for mkn  421 ( light grey square ; @xcite ) and pks  2155 - 304 ( dark - grey ellipse ; @xcite ) for comparison.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]        @xcite noticed that while the absorption line systems are remarkably similar between mkn  421 and pks  2155 - 304 sightlines , their x - ray ems are different by a factor of @xmath9 1.5 ( @xmath66 for mkn  421 and @xmath67 for pks 2155 - 304 ) .",
    "they attributed this to the anisotropy of the circum - galactic medium ( cgm ) , for which the mkn  421 absorber has a much larger path length .",
    "our estimated em is much larger than both sightlines .",
    "using their model the 3c  273 absorber would have a path length longer than the size of the local group .",
    "so it appears more likely the 3c  273 absorber is local around the galactic disk , with a high density and a strong non - thermal motion .",
    "_ fuse _  observed 3c  273 for 43.3 @xmath29 on april 23 , 2000 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the strong , @xmath68 1031.93   transition was clearly detected with three distinguish components , with velocities at -160  100 , 105  160 , as well as a broad wing at 160  260 @xmath69 .",
    "we analyzed the three components and found for the broad - wing component , the same collisional ionization can explain the column density ratio between and very well ( the blue lines in figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "this component has an column density of @xmath70 .",
    "the derived size of the x - ray absorber along 3c  273 sightline , @xmath9 5  15 kpc , firmly puts the hot gas at the distant galactic disk and possibly beyond , toward the direction of the galactic central region .",
    "the x - ray absorber is unlikely to be associated with either radio loop i or iv , since both structures are within a few hundred pc ; it is also unlikely to be linked to the giant loop - shape structure seen in the _",
    "fermi_-lat data ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) . also , the em along this sightline is nearly an order - of - magnitude higher than those measured along the mkn  421 and pks  2155 - 304 sightline .",
    "while @xcite suggested the hot gas along these two sightlines is located at the distant galactic halo with a path length of more than 100 kpc , it is unlikely the case for the 3c  273 sightline .",
    "this sightline passes through part of the region that is associated with the nps and the northern arc discovered in the _ fermi_-lat data .",
    "considering the proximity to the northern _ fermi _ bubble , it is interesting to discuss the impact of the _ fermi _ bubbles on the x - ray absorber along the 3c  273 sightline",
    ". it is unlikely the x - ay absorption / emission is produced by the same material located within the _ fermi _ bubbles : the temperature inside the bubble is hotter than @xmath71 k @xcite , and all the ion species we detected in the x - ray would be completely ionized at this temperature .",
    "however , such x - ray absorber can be located in the region that is shock - impacted by the expansion of the _ fermi _ northern bubble .",
    "x - ray observations of the edge of _ fermi _ bubble suggested a possible link with the nps in x - ray @xcite . assuming an adiabatic gas of @xmath72 , we estimated a shock mach number of @xmath73 and a shock expansion velocity of @xmath74 , following @xcite .",
    "such velocity would imply a bubble formation time of @xmath75 yr , assuming a bubble size of @xmath9 10 kpc .",
    "the shock temperature for an adiabatic expansion shock can be estimated as @xmath76 k @xcite for @xmath77 , close to the temperature predicted by the uv and x - ray ion ratios in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton grating observations of 3c  273 , one of the brightest extragalactic x - ray sources , with a focus on the x - ray absorption lines produced by highly ionized metal species at @xmath0 .",
    "we summarize our finding below .    using high resolution x - ray spectroscopy we measured the physical properties of the x - ray absorber along the 3c  273 sightline .",
    "our measured line properties are largely consistent with previous work of @xcite based on a subset of the data used in this paper , while better photon statistics allows us to put much tighter constraints .",
    "the column density ratios between , , and suggested a temperature of @xmath78 k of the x - ray absorbing gas .",
    "this gas is either in collisional ionization equilibrium , or cooling at constant density or constant pressure .",
    "a joint analysis with the x - ray emission data suggests that the x - ray absorber likely has a density of @xmath79 , with a linear size of @xmath9 5 to 15 kpc .",
    "we compare the 3c 273 sightline with the sightlines of mkn  421 and pks  2155 - 304 , which have similar or even better quality x - ray spectra .",
    "we find the line @xmath35s of the 3c  273 are significantly higher than the other two sightlines .",
    "in particular , we find the large @xmath35s are the result of higher doppler-@xmath34 parameter , rather than large column density .",
    "while the doppler-@xmath34 parameters of the x - ray absorbers detected in the mkn  421 and pks  2155 - 304 sightlines can be naturally explained by thermal broadening , a significant non - thermal component of @xmath49 is presented in the 3c  273 x - ray absorber .",
    "such non - thermal velocity has been suggested before as an evidence of an outflow , possibly produced by stellar wind and supernova activities in the galactic center and the bulge region @xcite .",
    "large scale , bi - polar outflow was also proposed based on _ rosat _ and other observations ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest here an alternative that the non - thermal velocity we detected in the 3c  273 sightline can be naturally explained as the expansion of the newly discovered  fermi bubble \" , with a shock velocity of @xmath80 .",
