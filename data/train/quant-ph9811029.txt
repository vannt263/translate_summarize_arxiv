    "namely , the boson state undergoes a nonequilibrium time evolution when its number fluctuation is initially suppressed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the time evolution of the interacting bosons in such a case , and to discuss how an order parameter is developed .",
    "we first review and discuss the case where the box is closed and the boson number @xmath2 is exactly fixed ( section [ sec_pre ] ) .",
    "the ground - state wavefunction of such a case may be obtained by the superposition of bogoliubov s solution @xmath20 over various values of the phase of @xmath27 [ eq .  ( [ inverse_tr_cl ] ) ] .",

    "we obtain @xmath7 in a general form in which all the details of the box - environment interaction @xmath42 have been absorbed in the magnitude of the leakage flux @xmath8 .",
    "we show that the time evolution can be described very simply in terms of @xmath5 , as the evolution from a single nsib at @xmath10 , into a classical mixture , with a time dependent distribution , of nsibs of various values of @xmath2 at @xmath11 [ eq .",

    "we then discuss the phase @xmath43 as a variable approximately conjugate to the number @xmath2 ( section [ sec_number vs phase ] ) . to treat the quantum phase properly ,",
    "we consider the sine and cosine operators , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "it is generally very difficult to define such operators for interacting many - particle systems .",
    "fortunately , however , in terms of the natural coordinate @xmath6 we successfully define @xmath44 and @xmath45 for interacting bosons , using which we can analyze the phase property in a fully quantum - mechanical manner .",

    "we also discuss the action of the measurements ( or , their equivalents ) of @xmath2 and of @xmath43 ( section [ sec_action of meas . ] ) .",
    "the forms of @xmath14 after such measurements are discussed . as an example of the phase measurement",
    ", we discuss an interference experiment of two condensates which are prepared independently in two boxes .",
    "it was already established for _ non - interacting _ bosons that the interference pattern is developed for _ each _ experimental run ( although the interference disappears in the _ average _ over many runs ) @xcite . using our formula for interacting bosons ,",
    "we show that the same conclusion is drawn very clearly and naturally for _ interacting _ bosons .",
    "we finally consider the order parameter according to a few typical definitions , as well as their time evolution ( section [ sec_op ] ) .",
    "we show that the off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) does not distinguish nsib , npib and csib .",
    "hence , the order parameter @xmath16 defined from odlro [ eq .  ( [ xi ] ) ] ,",
    "does not distinguish them either .",
    "on the other hand , the other order parameter @xmath17 , defined as the expectation value of the boson operator @xmath18 , has different values among these states . in particular , for each element of the prm of npibs , we show that @xmath17 evolves from zero to a finite value very quickly : after the leakage of only two or three bosons , each element acquires a full , stable and definite ( non - fluctuating ) value of @xmath17 .",
    "we consider the phase transition of interacting bosons confined in a large , but _",
    "finite _ box of volume @xmath19 .",
    "phase transitions are usually discussed in systems with an _ infinite _ volume ( or , the @xmath34 limit is taken at the end of the calculation ) , because infinite degrees of freedom are necessary in the relevant energy scale for _ strict _ transitions @xcite .",
    "in such a case , we must select a single physical hilbert space among many possibilities , which selection corresponds to a strict phase transition . however , phase transitions do occur even in systems of finite @xmath19 in the sense that a single phase lasts longer than the time of observation if its linear dimension exceeds the correlation length at the temperature of interest @xcite .",
    "hence , it is physically interesting and important to explore phase transitions in finite systems . because of the finiteness of @xmath19 ( and",
    "the fact that the interaction potential @xmath46 is well - behaved ) , the von neumann s uniqueness theorem can be applied .",
    "this allows us to develop a theory in a unique hilbert space .",

    "we start from the standard hamiltonian for interacting bosons confined in a large , but finite box of volume @xmath19 : @xmath47 here , we neglect a confining potential of the box because in the present work we are not interested in its effects such as the spatial inhomogeneity of the boson states in the box , and also because we expect that main physics of the nonequilibrium evolution of our interest would not be affected by such effects .",
