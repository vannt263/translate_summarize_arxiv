    "this paper examines the connection between convex analysis and optimal stopping of one - dimensional diffusions .",
    "the connection between convex analysis and optimal stopping dates back to dynkin @xcite where the solution to an optimal stopping problem of the type @xmath0\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a markov process was first characterised the smallest superharmonic majorant of the gains function @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath1 is a one - dimensional diffusion , the corresponding superharmonic functions can been characterised in terms of a generalised type of concavity ( see @xcite pp .",
    "this so called ` superharmonic characterisation ' of the value function is discussed in further detail in @xcite chapter iv section 9 , to illustrate the properties of the solution to certain free - boundary problems associated with optimal stopping problems .",
    "more recently , the change of time and scale technique underpinning the superharmonic characterisation was ` re - introduced ' in @xcite .    the minimax version of this problem is referred to as an optimal stopping ( or dynkin ) game .",
    "the sup - player selects a stopping time @xmath3 with the aim of maximising the functional @xmath4}+h\\left ( x_{\\sigma } \\right ) \\mathbb{i}_{\\left [ \\tau > \\sigma \\right ] } \\right]$ ] while the inf - player selects a stopping time @xmath5 with the aim of minimising the same functional , optimal stopping games are explained in more detail in section [ subsection diffusions ] below .",
    "a variant of this optimal stopping game was first studied by dynkin @xcite using martingale based methods .",
    "these problems have also been approached via variational inequalities in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the superharmonic characterisation of the solution to optimal stopping problems has been extended to optimal stopping games where it is shown that the value function is a ` semiharmonic ' function .",
    "the value function is shown to be the smallest function which is superharmonic and dominates @xmath2 on the set @xmath6 as well as the largest function which is subharmonic and minorises @xmath7 on the set @xmath8 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that a single function with both these properties exists if and only if the optimal stopping game exhibits a saddle point .",
    "when the underlying markov process is a one - dimensional diffusion , these dual problems have been formulated in terms of a generalisation of the legendre transform in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to establish the ` semi - harmonic characterisation ' of the value function of optimal stopping games driven by one dimensional diffusions using purely analytical techniques .",
