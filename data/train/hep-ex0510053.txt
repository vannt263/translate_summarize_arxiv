    "weak semileptonic decays of charm mesons continue to attract interest due to the relative simplicity of their theoretical description : the matrix element of these decays can be factorized as the product of the leptonic and hadronic currents .",
    "this makes the @xmath0 decay a natural place to study the @xmath11 system in the absence of interactions with other hadrons .",
    "it is known that the @xmath11 final state of @xmath0 decay is strongly dominated by the @xmath4 vector resonance @xcite .",
    "the large and clean sample of @xmath12 events collected by the fermilab focus experiment provides an excellent opportunity to measure the @xmath4 mass and width , as well as the effective blatt - weisskopf damping factor parameter discussed in ref .",

    "in addition we also search for structures other than the @xmath4 resonance in the mass range of 0.65 gev/@xmath1 @xmath13 1.5 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the available phase space allows us to investigate the low mass scalar sector whose spectroscopy has been increasingly studied since the indication of the existence of the broad scalar resonance @xmath14 in @xmath15 decays from a dalitz plot analysis performed by e791  @xcite .",
    "recently e791 has also pursued an independent approach for the scalar component extracting directly the scalar phase shift from their data  @xcite .",
    "these two results , obtained using @xmath15 hadronic decay is substantially different from the one obtained in a partial wave analysis performed by the lass scattering experiment  @xcite .",
    "lass observed that the s - wave amplitude in the @xmath16 elastic region can be represented as the sum of a @xmath17 resonance and a smooth shape , consistent with the non - resonant hypothesis .",

    "scattering phase shift measured by lass and the one measured by the e791 experiment ( solid circles ) in @xmath15 charm hadronic decay ( figure provided by b. meadows ) .",
    "[ lass_kpipi],width=340,height=226 ]    due to watson s theorem  @xcite the observed @xmath11 phase shifts in @xmath0 decays should be the same as those measured in @xmath11 elastic scattering .",
    "this establishes a connection between the production and the scattering mechanisms , adding crucial information about @xmath11 hadronic interaction and the role of the bachelor @xmath18 final state interaction in hadronic decays .",
    "the data were collected in the wideband photoproduction experiment focus during the fermilab 19961997 fixed - target run . in focus , a forward multi - particle spectrometer is used to measure the interactions of high energy photons on a segmented beo target .",

    "we estimate the charm and non - charm background contributions to be , respectively , 17.8% and 3.2% of the total number of events over our signal region .",
    "four - body decays of spinless particles are described by five kinematic variables .",
    "the variables chosen in this analysis are the @xmath16 invariant mass ( @xmath19 ) , the square of the @xmath20 mass ( @xmath21 ) , and three decay angles : the angle between the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 direction in the @xmath16 rest frame ( @xmath24 ) , which defines one decay plane , the angle between the @xmath25 and the @xmath23 direction in the @xmath20 rest frame ( @xmath26 ) , which defines the second decay plane , and the acoplanarity angle ( @xmath27 ) between these two decay planes .",
    "the differential decay rate can be represented by a coherent sum of resonant and non - resonant contributions to the angular momentum eigenstates of the @xmath16 system , @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the weak matrix element for a transition with angular momentum @xmath31 , @xmath32 represents the form of the hadronic final state amplitude contribution of resonance @xmath33 ( or non - resonant ) with strength @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the phase space density .",

    "the non - resonant contribution is assumed to be scalar .",
    "the parametrization of resonant states with angular momentum @xmath31 is given by the product of a breit - wigner and the normalized @xmath38 coupling , @xmath39    @xmath40    where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the magnitude of the kaon momentum in the resonance rest frame , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",

    "the @xmath11 spectrum described by this equation includes the dominant contribution from the @xmath4 resonance , possible high mass contributions from the @xmath17 and @xmath36 resonances , and low mass scalar components comprised of a non - resonant and a possible @xmath14 contributions , both populating the region where significant discrepancies were found between the data and the predicted @xmath52 angular decay distributions .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that a nearly constant amplitude and phase contribution to the helicity zero amplitude of the virtual @xmath53 was required to adequately fit the observed decay angular distributions .",

    "figure  [ fig_asymmetry ] compares the distribution obtained in the data with the predictions from the non - resonant and @xmath14 models in the absence of additional phase shifts as required by watson s theorem . since a simulation using the lass parametrization of the non - resonant contribution is sufficient to reproduce the data , we exclude a possible @xmath14 contribution from further consideration .     weighted by @xmath54 .",
