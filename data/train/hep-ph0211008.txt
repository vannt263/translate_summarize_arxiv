    "in the framework of the qcd - improved parton model , the inclusive production of single hadrons is described by means of fragmentation functions ( ffs ) @xmath8 .",
    "the value of @xmath8 corresponds to the probability for the parton @xmath9 produced at short distance @xmath10 to form a jet that includes the hadron @xmath11 carrying the fraction @xmath2 of the longitudinal momentum of @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not yet possible to calculate the ffs from first principles , in particular for hadrons with masses smaller than or comparable to the asymptotic scale parameter @xmath12 .",
    "however , given their @xmath2 dependence at some energy scale @xmath13 , the evolution with @xmath13 may be computed perturbatively in qcd using the timelike altarelli - parisi ( ap ) equations @xcite .",
    "this allows us to test qcd quantitatively within one experiment observing single hadrons at different values of centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath14 ( in the case of @xmath3 annihilation ) or transverse momentum @xmath7 ( in the case of scattering ) .",
    "moreover , the factorization theorem guarantees that the @xmath8 functions are independent of the process in which they have been determined and represent a universal property of @xmath11 .",
    "this enables us to make quantitative predictions for other types of experiments as well .    during the last seven years",
    ", the experiments at cern lep1 and slac slc have provided us with a wealth of high - precision information on how partons fragment into low - mass charged hadrons ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the data partly comes as light- , @xmath16- , and @xmath6-quark - enriched samples without @xcite or with identified final - state hadrons ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) @xcite or as gluon - tagged three - jet samples without hadron identification @xcite .",
    "motivated by this new situation , the author , together with kramer and ptter , recently updated , refined , and extended a previous analysis @xcite by generating new leading - order ( lo ) and next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) sets of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ffs @xcite . by also including in our fits @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 data ( without flavour separation ) from pep",
    "@xcite , with cm energy @xmath20  gev , we obtained a handle on the scaling violations in the ffs , which enabled us to determine the strong - coupling constant @xmath21 .",
    "the formation of @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons from @xmath16 and @xmath6 quarks , respectively , is a genuinely nonperturbative process , so that it is indispensable to employ nonperturbative ffs .",
    "furthermore , if the characteristic energy scale @xmath13 is large against the heavy - quark mass @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , then the qcd - improved parton model with @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) active quark flavours is the appropriate theoretical framework , which allows for coherent analyses of data from @xmath3 , lepton - hadron , and hadron - hadron collisions @xcite .",
    "this contribution is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : two ] , we present some details of our global fits @xcite and assess the quality of the resulting ffs .",
    "we also discuss the determination of @xmath21 from the scaling violations in the ffs @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sec : three ] , we present comparisons of our nlo predictions for inclusive charged - hadron production @xcite with @xmath0 data from s@xmath0s @xcite and the tevatron @xcite and with @xmath1 data from hera @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sec : four ] , we demonstrate that the @xmath7 distribution of inclusive @xmath23-meson hadroproduction measured by cdf @xcite is well described at nlo in the qcd parton model with @xmath27 endowed with nonperturbative ffs , once the latter are fitted to lep1 data @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec : five ] .",
    "the nlo formalism for extracting ffs from measurements of the cross section @xmath28 of @xmath29 is comprehensively described in @xcite .",
    "we work in the modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath30 ) renormalization and factorization scheme and choose the renormalization and factorization scales to be @xmath31 , except for gluon - tagged three - jet events , where we put @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being the gluon - jet energy in the cm frame . here , the dimensionless parameter @xmath34 is introduced to determine the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath21 from scale variations . as usual",
    ", we allow for variations of @xmath34 between @xmath35 and 2 about the default value 1 .    our strategy was to only include in our fits lep1 and slc data with both flavour separation and hadron identification @xcite , gluon - tagged three - jet samples with a fixed gluon - jet energy @xcite , and the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 data sets from the pre - lep1/slc era with the highest statistics and the finest binning in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 value per fitted data point turned out to be @xmath37 ( 0.98 ) at lo ( nlo ) .",
    "the goodness of our fit may also be judged from figs .",
    "[ fig : fit](a ) and ( b ) , where our lo and nlo fit results are compared with the aleph , delphi , opal , and sld data @xcite .",
    "other data served us for cross checks @xcite .",
    "in particular , we probed the scaling violations in the ffs through comparisons with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 data from desy doris and petra , with cm energies between 5.4 and 34  gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we tested the gluon ff , which enters the unpolarized cross section only at nlo , by comparing our predictions for the longitudinal cross section , where it already enters at lo , with available data @xcite . finally , we directly compared our gluon ff with the one recently measured by delphi in three - jet production with gluon identification as a function of @xmath2 at various energy scales @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "all these comparisons led to rather encouraging results .",
    "we also verified that our ffs satisfy reasonably well the momentum sum rules , which we did not impose as constraints on our fits .    [ cols= \"",
    "< , < \" , ]     the idea @xcite of performing a coherent analysis of lep1 and tevatron data of inclusive @xmath23-meson production was recently revived using an unconventional scheme named fonll , in which the traditional result in the massive scheme @xcite and a suitably subtracted result in a massless scheme with pffs are linearly combined @xcite .",
    "the degree of arbitrariness in this procedure may be assessed by noticing that the massless - scheme term is weighted with an ad - hoc coefficient function of the form @xmath38 so as to effectuate its suppression in the low-@xmath7 range and that this term is evaluated at @xmath39 while the massive - scheme term is evaluated at @xmath7 . since the fonll scheme interpolates between the massive scheme and the massless scheme with pffs",
    ", it inherits the weaknesses of both schemes detailed above .",
    "in particular , the negativity of the nlo cross section of @xmath40 in the upper @xmath2 range forces one to exclude the data points located there from the fit . in @xcite , this is achieved by resorting to what is called there the moments method , i.e. , the large-@xmath2 region is manually faded out by selecting one particular low moment of the @xmath41 ff , namely the one corresponding to the average @xmath2 value , thereby leaving the residual information encoded in the data unused .",
    "we reviewed recent lo and nlo analyses of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ffs @xcite , which also yielded new values for @xmath21 @xcite . although these ffs are genuinely nonperturbative objects , they possess two important properties that follow from perturbative considerations within the qcd - improved parton model and are amenable to experimental tests , namely scaling violations and universality .",
    "the scaling violations were tested @xcite by making comparisons with data of @xmath3 annihilation at cm energies below @xcite and above @xcite those pertaining to the data that entered the fits .",
    "the universality property was checked @xcite by performing a global study of high - energy data on hadroproduction in @xmath0 collisions @xcite and on photoproduction in @xmath42 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite collisions .",
    "our nlo ffs @xcite agree with other up - to - date sets @xcite within the present experimental errors @xcite .",
    "high - energy data on hadroproduction particularly probes the ffs in the large-@xmath2 region , is especially sensitive to the gluon ffs , and , therefore , carries valuable information complementary to that provided by @xmath3 data .",
    "this information , apart from being interesting in its own right , is indispensible in order to reliably predict the @xmath4 background for the @xmath5 signal of the intermediate - mass higgs boson at the tevatron and the lhc",
    ". it would thus be highly desirable if the experiments at the tevatron made an effort to update their analyses , which date back to 1988 @xcite .    adopting a similar theoretical framework for @xmath23-meson production",
    ", we demonstrated @xcite that the notorious excess of the tevatron data @xcite over existing theoretical calculations can be ascribed , at sufficiently large values of @xmath7 , to nonperturbative fragmentation effects inappropriately taken into account previously . in combination with the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic qcd @xcite , this framework also leads to a successful description @xcite of inclusive @xmath43 and @xmath44 production from @xmath23-meson decay @xcite .",
    "a rigorous procedure to implement the finite-@xmath25 terms in an nlo framework where terms of the form @xmath45 are resummed by ap evolution and the universality of the ffs is guaranteed by the factorization theorem @xcite is to directly subtract the would - be collinear singularities of the form @xmath46 in the massive - scheme result in a way that conforms with the massless scheme @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
