    "recent progress in understanding renormalization in compactified anti - desitter space ( ads ) has led to the intriguing possibility of constructing models which preserve grand unification at an exponentially large scale , and at the same time realize the physics of extra dimensions at the tev scale .",
    "these models are variations of the randall sundrum ( rs ) scenario  @xcite in which two branes act as boundaries to a bulk region of 5d ads space . in conformal coordinates the spacetime geometry takes the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 parametrizes location in the bulk spacetime , bounded by a uv ( planck ) brane at @xmath8 and an ir ( tev ) brane at @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 labels 4d poincare coordinates parallel to the branes .",
    "the curvature scale @xmath4 is taken to be slightly below the fundamental scale @xmath11 .",
    "despite the fact that the proper distance between the two branes is order @xmath12 , the masses of the low - lying kaluza - klein ( kk ) states scale with @xmath13 , which to address the hierarchy problem is taken to be of order the tev scale ( a simple mechanism for the generation of this exponentially low energy scale can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "given that the structure of kk states propagating in this background is similar to the 4d spectrum of a bulk field propagating in 5d flat space compactified on an interval of radius @xmath14 , one would imagine that a low energy observable such as the weak mixing angle receives large quantum corrections , of order @xmath15 , from gut scale physics . in this case",
    ", the standard tools of perturbative field theory can be effectively applied only for relative low values of @xmath16 ( a loop factor above @xmath13 , say ) .",
    "even then , the linear dependence of loop corrections on the values of heavy particle masses introduces a loss of predictive power .",
    "however , loop corrections to low energy observables in compactified ads actually scale as a log of @xmath17 , with @xmath18 a low energy scale typically of order the weak scale .",
    "this possibility was first raised in  @xcite for the case of abelian gauge fields coupled to scalar matter fields .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward way to obtain this result is to calculate the low energy vacuum polarization graphs , summing over the tower of kk modes in the loops . while technically correct , the calculation is cumbersome and not terribly illuminating , as it gives no clue as to how this miracle occurs .",
    "instead , in  @xcite we showed how the one - loop logarithms in the low energy coupling predictions emerge naturally from the study of correlators which are restricted to the planck brane and have external momenta greater than @xmath13 . due to the relation between energy scale @xmath19 and bulk position @xmath7 in background ads geometries , @xmath20 such correlators",
    "are guaranteed to remain perturbative up to energies much higher than the kk mass scale . yet at low energies they must match directly onto the measured zero mode observables .",
    "thus by following their flow across a wide range of energies , one can use these planck correlators to correctly account for the dependence of low energy quantities on uv scales .",
    "the remarkable fact that such flows turn out to be logarithmic , as in a purely 4d theory , is perhaps not surprising given that the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , as it applies to rs scenarios  @xcite , implies that there is a well defined prescription for relating planck correlators in the ads background to quantities in a 4d conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "the non - decoupling approach to computing logarithmic corrections can be found in  @xcite . for other approaches to understanding the logarithms that arise in the low energy predictions , see  @xcite .",
    "not only is the momentum dependence of the planck correlators logarithmic , but the precise value of the numerical coefficient of the non - universal one - loop logarithms can be unambiguously calculated  . in  @xcite , we used ads / cft arguments to show that the coefficient of the one - loop logarithm induced by a bulk charged scalar field coupled to a @xmath21 gauge field is identical to what one finds in a 4d theory .",
    "there we also gave a simple argument for understanding this logarithmic flow purely in ads language , in terms of the structure of the kk wavefunctions of bulk fields .",
    "we elaborated on this line of reasoning in  @xcite .",
    "essentially , all kk modes of a scalar field with masses below @xmath4 are localized toward @xmath9 ( that is , their wavefunction is exponentially smaller at @xmath8 ) except for a single zero mode whose overlap with the planck brane is of order unity .",
    "it follows that the effect of a bulk scalar field on the planck brane vacuum polarization is summarized simply by the loop contribution of this zero mode , i.e. , the computation reduces to a purely 4d one - loop integral .",
    "these arguments naively break down when bulk gauge bosons or fermions appear in the loops . in such situations ,",
    "it is no longer always true that the kk resonances have exponentially small amplitudes on the planck brane relative to the zero mode .",
    "we will show that despite the fact that a large number of modes contributes to the two - point function , the relative running of couplings in non - abelian bulk gauge theories , as measured by planck observers , is identical to what one obtains by solving renormalization group ( rg ) equations in ordinary 4d gauge theories to leading log accuracy .",
    "the relevant analysis can be found in section  [ sec : gauge ] . to make the discussion self contained , we first review in section  [ sec : scalar ] the analysis of scalar loop contributions to the running of the gauge couplings .",
    "bulk fermions possess zero modes for any value of the bulk mass , but can lead to incalculable corrections if the mass is larger than the curvature scale @xmath4 .",
    "these issues as well as other subtleties related to bulk fermions are discussed in section  [ sec : fermions ] .",
    "we conclude the paper with a section which is meant as a tool kit for model building .",
    "those who are not interested in the technical issues will find in the final section a summary of the relevant aspects of our analysis .",
    "we take the point of view that any large logarithm that appears in a low energy quantity must arise from the rg flow of an observable that is well defined in the uv . because of the correlation between bulk position and energy scales implied by the ads metric , the only observables that are truly accessible to effective field theory methods up to energies near the planck scale are bulk field green s functions whose external points are localized near the region @xmath8 of the compactified ads background .",
    "thus in @xcite we chose to work directly with correlators whose endpoints lie strictly on the planck brane , at @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , we define the running coupling for a gauge theory in ads in terms of the two - point function of the bulk gauge field @xmath22 at least in a theory with @xmath21 gauge symmetry ( we discuss later the extension of this program to non - abelian groups ) , this gives rise to an effective coupling @xmath23 where we denote @xmath24 .    before considering one - loop corrections ,",
    "let us review the computation of @xmath25 at tree level . for simplicity",
    ", we will work in euclidean signature throughout . using the gauge boson propagator ( in landau gauge ) from appendix  [ app : props ] , one finds @xmath26 note that the expression for the propagator we have used to define the running coupling @xmath27 is insensitive to the effects of the brane at @xmath9 .",
    "this is adequate as long as we are probing the gauge potential at momenta @xmath28 , for which the effects of the tev brane are irrelevant .",
    "we will also restrict ourselves to momenta less than the scale @xmath4 .",
    "for momenta larger than @xmath4 , the green s functions only probe field correlations over distances that are so short that one may as well neglect the effects of curvature and compute directly in a flat background space .",
    "so for @xmath29 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tree ] ) gives rise to @xmath30 this is the familiar classical running of the gauge couplings as seen by planck brane observers .",
    "a discussion of the origin of this effect from the point of view of the ads / cft correspondence can be found in  @xcite .",
    "already at this level , this result gives a simple illustration of the general philosophy that all large logarithms in low energy quantities arise as a result of running planck brane correlators down to low energy .",
    "consider the gauge coupling measured by a low energy observer .",
    "such an observer only probes the interactions of the lightest charged kk states with the kk zero mode of the bulk gauge field . in terms of the 5d coupling @xmath31 , the leading order result for the coupling of these light states to the gauge field zero mode follows straightforwardly from dimensional reduction of the 5d action @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the separation between the uv and the ir brane . in terms of our parametrization of the 5d metric ,",
    "this is given by @xmath34 which involves a large logarithm of the ratio of two energy scales .",
    "on the other hand , consider the gauge coupling measured at low energies by observers localized to the @xmath8 boundary .",
    "to predict the result of such a measurement , one should use the running planck brane coupling evaluated at momenta @xmath35 . but according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : classrun ] ) , this quantity is in agreement ( up to small uncertainties in the precise value of the matching scale ) with the zero mode result",
    ". it must be , since momenta which are less than the kk mass gap @xmath13 can not distinguish between planck observers and observers composed of kk zero modes of bulk fields .",
    "it follows that the large logarithms that arise in low energy quantities can be obtained from the flow toward the ir of running couplings defined in terms of planck correlators .",
    "we now turn to the computation of quantum corrections to planck brane correlators due to bulk scalar fields , non - abelian gauge boson loops , and fermion fields .",
    "let us first review the computation of the one - loop vacuum polarization effects of a charged scalar coupled to a @xmath21 gauge field along the lines of  @xcite .",
    "following the notation for the propagators discussed in the appendix , we find at one - loop @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the usual vacuum polarization graph , and @xmath39 is the seagull term .",
    "the scalar field propagator is denoted by @xmath40 . in both these equations",
    ", we have for simplicity dropped purely longitudinal components of the gauge boson propagators , since these are not relevant to our definition of the running coupling . also note that we will regulate possible uv divergences that may arise by working in dimensional regularization and subtracting poles at @xmath41 .",
    "one can quantitatively determine the leading momentum dependence of these integrals in the region @xmath29 by the following arguments .",
    "first note that @xmath42 is exponentially suppressed away from from the region @xmath43 due to the asymptotic behavior of the modified bessel function , @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the integrals over @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : l2 ] ) have support in the region @xmath47 .",
    "however , since @xmath48 for @xmath49 the bulk of the contribution to the integral over this region arises from values of @xmath7 near @xmath12 , where @xmath50 is smallest , there is no suppression from the external lines .",
    "however , in this region the integrand has no poles that could give rise to logarithmic behavior and is well behaved at @xmath51 .",
    "thus this contribution is power suppressed . ] .",
    "we conclude from this that only the behavior of the integrand near @xmath8 is important for the determination of the one - loop running .",
    "the loop amplitudes can be further simplified by noting that for external momenta @xmath52 , the leading non - analytic behavior of the one - loop amplitude can be obtained by replacing all internal loop propagators @xmath53 with their expansions in the limit @xmath54 ( here we denote by @xmath55 any combination of the external momentum @xmath18 and the loop momentum integration variable @xmath56 ) .",
    "because the external gauge boson lines force the range of @xmath46 to effectively lie near @xmath12 , this approximation clearly breaks down for loop momenta of order @xmath4 .",
    "however , for @xmath57 , loop momenta above the scale @xmath4 can not give rise to the non - analytic effects that we are trying to determine .",
    "thus our approximation is an effective choice of scheme , since the contributions that have been dropped are analytic in the external momentum .",
    "this choice of scheme , if used consistently throughout , can not affect the low energy predictions for physical observables .    to make this more explicit",
    ", we use the @xmath58 asymptotic expansion @xmath59 of the propagator of a scalar field with mass @xmath5 ( the full scalar propagator can be found in the appendix ) . in this equation , @xmath60 , and we have taken @xmath61 . note that the pole structure in this propagator suggests that our loop amplitude receives a dominant contribution from a single 4d mode . for @xmath62 , both the location of the pole in eq .",

    "it is perhaps surprising , given that we are expanding the propagator in a region of momentum space @xmath69 , that effectively only the zero mode contributes to the sum in eq .",

    "the analysis of the one - loop contribution of bulk scalars to vacuum polarization graphs was simplified due to the fact that , in terms of kk modes , one can identify a single state which has non - negligible overlap with the planck brane , and thus gives rise to the leading quantum effects .",

    "we will show that despite this fact , the leading momentum dependence of gauge couplings as measured by planck observers is still logarithmic , with coefficients that identically match the 4d beta function coefficients for non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "we begin by specifying the sense in which we use planck correlators to define effective gauge couplings in the non - abelian case .",

    "first of all , it is clear that gut breaking on the @xmath9 boundary can not modify the running of the gauge couplings between the scales @xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "this is because for a wide range of external momenta @xmath29 , tev brane effects are exponentially damped by the external gauge boson propagators .",
    "thus we restrict our discussion to planck brane or bulk breaking of the unified gauge group .",
    "if the gut symmetry is broken by adding a planck localized 4d scalar field @xmath131 whose vev breaks , say , @xmath132 down to @xmath133 , then it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eq : local ] ) that the dynamics is identical to that of a 4d gauge field coupled to the symmetry breaking @xmath131 field .",
    "the contribution to the prediction for @xmath89 from the gauge fields will involve the usual beta function coefficients that one would calculate in the standard model , multiplying large logarithms of @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the symmetry breaking vev .",
    "explicit breaking of @xmath132 by orbifold boundary conditions can be taken into account by inserting a delta functional into eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi4 ] ) which enforces the vanishing of the components of the gauge field which are odd under the orbifold parity . from the point of view of eq .",
    "( [ eq : local ] ) this case represents a situation in 4d where the full @xmath132 symmetry is never present at all . indeed , there are no dynamical gauge fields corresponding to the generators of @xmath132 which are not also in @xmath133 .",
    "boundary gauge kinetic terms at @xmath8 need not respect the full gut structure of the bulk theory . since the addition of boundary gauge couplings corresponds to non - universal shifts in the uv values of the tree - level @xmath136 , with @xmath137 , the couplings are never strictly unified universal , so that the effects of explicit @xmath132 breaking appear only as non - universal boundary conditions for the rg running at a scale @xmath87 . ] .",
    "thus , in order to make predictions , additional assumptions about the uv structure of the orbifold gut are necessary .",
    "it is customary to simply state  @xcite that the boundary couplings at the scale @xmath87 saturate the bound given by the assumption of strong coupling , in which case the uncertainty in the prediction for the low energy value of @xmath89 due to the non - universality of the uv couplings is of order @xmath138 , and therefore suppressed relative to the leading log prediction .",
    "our discussion here is in quantitative agreement with the results of  @xcite obtained by summing kk one - loop corrections to the low - energy gauge couplings in orbifold guts .",
    "however , our approach makes manifest the 4d nature of the prediction .    in the case",
    "where the gut is broken spontaneously by the higgs mechanism in the bulk space , the low energy couplings again obey the same relations that one would obtain by solving the rg equations for the non - abelian gauge couplings in 4d . in this case , the uv scale appearing in the logarithmic corrections to the gauge couplings is related to the bulk mass term acquired by the xy gauge bosons through the higgsing of the gauge group , @xmath139 ( @xmath140 is a bulk scalar whose vev breaks the gut group to the standard model ) .",
    "this can be seen most clearly by working in unitary gauge , where the relevant degrees of freedom are the massless bulk standard model gauge fields , the massive @xmath3 bosons , and the massive higgs field .",
    "assuming that all bulk masses are smaller than the curvature scale , it is clear from our analysis of scalar fields that the contribution of the higgs to the running of the planck brane gauge couplings is frozen out at a scale comparable to its bulk mass .",
    "as is the case with massive scalar fields , the kk modes of a massive gauge field are localized away from the planck brane , except for a single isolated mode with mass of order the bulk mass .",
    "this can be seen by examining the pole structure of the massive gauge boson propagator .",
    "ignoring lorentz structure , in @xmath0 this has the form @xmath141 where we have taken @xmath58 ( which as in the scalar case , is the relevant asymptotic region for obtaining the non - analytic effects ) . here , @xmath142 , with @xmath5 the gauge boson mass , which we have taken to be @xmath143 . from this equation",
    ", we see that the gauge bosons which acquire a mass due to the bulk higgs drop out of the running at a scale @xmath144 if one is willing to tolerate a slight hierarchy in @xmath145 , then there may be interesting new model building possibilities . for instance , one could have unification with an intermediate scale @xmath1 without loss of predictivity .",
    "this is in contrast to a typical two - scale scenario in 4d , where the intermediate scale introduces a new unknown parameter , thus weakening the theory s predictive power .    if gut breaking occurs at a scale such that @xmath146 , then the dominant corrections to the low energy gauge couplings can be obtained by a flat spacetime computation . for @xmath147 , the planck correlation function that defines the running gauge coupling exhibits power law running , just like in flat 5d space .",
    "this running is universal , until @xmath148 , at which point the heavy gauge bosons drop out of the running and only the standard model gauge fields contribute .",
    "the effect of integrating out the heavy fields can be incorporated into a non - universal shift in the bulk gauge coupling @xmath149 with a different group theory coefficient multiplying @xmath2 for each factor of the standard model group not shown ( we have also dropped factors of @xmath150 that arise from the loop integration ) . when evaluated at a scale @xmath52 ,",
    "the planck gauge coupling will thus receive , in light of eq .",
    "( [ eq : classrun ] ) , a non - universal logarithmic correction @xmath151 where we have dropped the logarithmic one - loop corrections of the massless gauge fields relative to the power enhanced term .",
    "when evaluated at @xmath35 , this gives rise to a correction to the low energy gauge couplings of the form @xmath152 .",
    "thus planck correlators reproduce power law effects when the symmetry breaking scale lies above @xmath4 .",
    "the limit @xmath153 has also been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "such power law terms invalidate the systematics , which is why we restrict ourselves to higgs breaking scales below the curvature scale , so that the leading quantum corrections are only logarithmically sensitive to the uv scale .      to compute planck brane vacuum polarization corrections due to bulk fermions , we proceed as in the scalar case considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : scalar ] .",
    "we will need the asymptotic form of the bulk propagators in the limit @xmath58 appropriate for our choice of scheme . using the results of the appendix",
    ", we find in this limit , for @xmath154 , @xmath155 where we have only shown the term whose dirac structure leads to a non - vanishing contribution to the vacuum polarization .",
    "note that we have taken fermion boundary conditions such that the right handed components of the bulk fermion are non - vanishing on the planck brane . in this equation , @xmath156 . for @xmath157 , @xmath158 and for @xmath159",
    ", we have @xmath160 these results are easy to understand in terms of the kk structure of bulk fermions in the truncated @xmath0 background  @xcite .",
    "the kk spectrum of a bulk fermion contains a 4d chiral zero mode whose degree of overlap with the planck brane depends on the ratio @xmath161 . in the case",
    "@xmath159 this chiral zero mode , as well as the kk modes , are localized to the tev brane . for @xmath154",
    ", the chiral mode is localized towards the planck brane , while the kk modes remain on the tev brane .",
    "this accounts for the isolated massless pole in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mlarge ] ) . in the case with @xmath162 , the chiral zero mode is flat and has order unity overlap with the planck brane , but the kk modes are not exponentially suppressed there , leading to the logarithmic enhancement of the propagator .",
    "in fact , supersymmetry in ads fixes the mass of the bulk fermion which appears in a gauge multiplet to be @xmath162 , so the @xmath162 fermion kk modes are identical to the wavefunctions of a massless bulk gauge field  @xcite .    from these propagators",
    ", we naively conclude that the cases in which @xmath163 generate the same large non - universal logarithm in the predictions for low energy gauge couplings as does a single chiral fermion in 4d . for @xmath154",
    "this is a consequence of the dominance of the chiral mode contribution to the planck correlator , while for @xmath162 one can use the same type of arguments as in the previous section to show that the logarithmic corrections to the propagator do not modify the leading log prediction that one gets by just keeping the zero mode .",
    "despite the presence of a massless chiral mode in the low energy spectrum , no such logarithm arises for @xmath164 , since the propagator eq .",
    "( [ eq : msmall ] ) is more singular in the uv .",
    "note however , that some care must be taken in interpreting the fermionic corrections to low energy gauge couplings .",
    "first of all , the statements of the previous paragraph would seem to indicate that the fermionic corrections are discontinuous functions of the bulk mass parameter @xmath5 as it crosses @xmath157 .",
    "this is because our scheme actually misses power corrections of the form @xmath165 which are negligible for @xmath61 , but become as large as the zero mode logarithms for @xmath161 of order unity .",
    "including these terms restores the continuity of the one - loop result as a function of the bulk mass .",
    "however , as already discussed in the previous section , when @xmath5 becomes larger than order @xmath4 these power corrections arise from purely flat spacetime effects , and correspond to non - universal shifts in the values of the bulk gauge couplings .",
    "these effects are therefore not accessible to the planck brane scheme , which treats the uv modes above the scale @xmath4 as universal . in any case , at low energy these power corrections give rise to a contribution proportional to @xmath166 , with @xmath167 , which is just the usual power law running effect encountered in 5d flat space .",
    "such linear sensitivity to the uv jeopardizes the possibility of making robust predictions for physical observables such as @xmath89 in gut models .",
    "the explicit linear dependence on the fermion bulk mass parameter is borne out by the results of  @xcite .",
    "since there is no chiral symmetry to protect the fermion bulk mass from becoming of order the planck scale in five dimensions , it would seem that bulk fermions are irrelevant .",
    "when @xmath168 there is no effect on the running , and when @xmath169 the systematics are seemingly lost .",
    "there are situations , however , where the fermionic power corrections are under control .",
    "for instance , if the gut is broken in such a way that the bulk mass parameters remain universal ( as typically happens in models where the symmetry is broken by boundary effects only ) then the incalculable power corrections cancel in the prediction for the weak mixing angle .",
    "in addition , if the gut is broken by orbifold boundary conditions , the zero mode structure need not appear in complete multiplets , in which case the large logarithms that arises if @xmath163 are meaningful , since the uv sensitive power piece cancels in the prediction and @xmath170 higgs hypermultiplets .",
    "as long as the bulk masses of these hypermultiplets are larger than or equal to @xmath171 , the doublet zero modes contribute large logarithms to @xmath89 just as in the mssm . ] .",
    "furthermore , in supersymmetric models , the mass of a bulk hypermultiplet does not receive radiative corrections , so small fermion masses are technically natural .",
    "thus in this case , although the chiral zero mode does not contribute to the running of the planck gauge couplings , the power corrections can be made small and under control .",
    "we note also that from the perspective of ads / cft , a @xmath172 fermion field whose zero mode is not projected out by boundary conditions will have , in the cft description , a corresponding fundamental field which couples to an irrelevant cft operator of conformal dimension @xmath173  @xcite .",
    "thus , the prediction for the running of the gauge coupling in the 4d dual cft will be just the 4d logarithm of a chiral fermion . the large power law corrections can not be seen in the cft since they correspond to effects that are purely minkowskian .",
    "this self - contained section is intended to be a summary of our results for model builders who would like to calculate the prediction for @xmath89 in a given model .",
    "a discussion of non - supersymmetric warped guts appears in  @xcite .",
    "gut model building in the context of warped supersymmetry has been discussed in  @xcite .    in building models one may choose to break the gut symmetry spontaneously , via higgs fields in the bulk or on the branes , or explicitly through orbifold boundary conditions .",
    "one may also add boundary kinetic and mass terms for the bulk fields , as well as fields that are confined to propagate strictly on the boundaries . in the higgs case ,",
    "the boundary terms must be consistent with the underlying gauge symmetry , and the mass term arises from the spontaneous breaking . on the other hand , in the orbifold case , the brane actions need not respect the gut symmetry if the boundary conditions do not . for the purposes of computing the leading log corrections to an observable like @xmath89 , one may ignore completely the details of the tev brane dynamics .",
    "this is clear from the point of view of planck correlators , as discussed in the previous sections and also in  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of planck correlators makes it clear that , whenever calculable , the one - loop quantum corrections to the low energy gauge couplings contain large logarithms whose coefficients can be read off the standard 4d beta function coefficients for the bulk field kk zero modes which have support on the planck brane .",
    "there will also be scheme dependent , universal , constants which will cancel in predictions for coupling constant differences .",
    "for instance , in the model of  @xcite , the 4d zero modes consist of the mssm vector and chiral multiplets , with the @xmath174 higgs doublets arising as planck brane localized ( @xmath163 ) zero modes of bulk hypermultiplets .",
    "the predictions for @xmath89 in that model are identical to those in the ordinary ( 4d ) mssm , despite the 5d nature of the model for energies higher than the kk mass gap .",
    "it is important to note that this simple rule for computing one - loop corrections assumes that non - universal bulk masses , when they arise , are smaller than the curvature scale @xmath4 .",
    "symmetry breaking masses larger than the curvature scale lead to large power corrections to the low energy gauge couplings whose origin is identical to the power law running encountered in flat space higher dimensional gauge theories . because of the high sensitivity to uv effects , such power corrections lead to a loss of predictivity in the low energy observables",
    "thus we will only consider situations in which the gut breaking occurs at a scale smaller than the curvature scale .",
    "finally , it is clear that 4d fields confined to the planck brane contribute the usual 4d logs to the running of the couplings , while tev brane fields do not contribute large logarithms at all .    while the running of the couplings is effectively determined by the zero mode structure of a given model , the uv scale ( i.e. the gut scale ) appearing in the low energy predictions is dependent on the manner in which the gut symmetry is broken . for orbifold breaking on the planck brane , there is , strictly speaking , no gut scale .",
    "indeed , there are tree - level contributions to the gauge couplings due to planck brane localized gauge kinetic operators for the standard model gauge fields which do not respect the full gut symmetry .",
    "to retain predictivity at one - loop , one assumes  @xcite that the non - universal boundary couplings evaluated at a scale near the 5d planck scale , where the gut becomes strongly coupled , are of order @xmath150 , and therefore suppressed relative to the logarithmically enhanced one - loop corrections . for a discussion of this in the context of ads ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "thus , under this strong coupling assumption , the argument of the logarithms in the one - loop prediction for @xmath89 in a warped gut broken by planck brane orbifold boundary conditions is of order @xmath175 .",
    "the coefficient of the logarithm is determined solely by the bulk field zero modes with support on the planck brane .",
    "there are uncertainties in this prediction which arise due to the unknown values of the boundary gauge couplings , and which have magnitude comparable to two - loop effects in 4d gauge theory .",
    "if the gut is broken spontaneously on the planck brane , then the uv scale appearing in the logarithmic correction to the low energy couplings is the symmetry breaking vev @xmath135 .",
    "thus the low energy @xmath89 prediction will again contain logarithms involving a large scale . in non - supersymmetric models",
    "it is also possible to break the gut symmetry spontaneously in the bulk by the higgs mechanism . while in this case",
    "the running of the couplings is largely determined by the zero modes , the low energy predictions may differ from what one finds in the standard model .",
    "this is because , as discussed in the previous section , the xy gauge bosons drop out of the running of the gauge couplings at a scale @xmath176 , which is lower than the scale @xmath177 where the higgs fields responsible for breaking the gut to the standard model gauge group stop their contribution to the running ( here @xmath178 is the bulk higgs vev ) . given that we take @xmath179 to avoid large non - universal power corrections , it follows that there may be significant , but model dependent , corrections to @xmath89 from the running between @xmath177 and @xmath176 .",
    "this deviation from the 4d standard model result is in addition to the small warped space corrections of the form @xmath180 emphasized in  @xcite .",
    "also , in models where the warped geometry addresses the hierarchy problem , the standard model higgs doublet is confined to tev brane , and therefore does not contribute large logarithms to the running of the gauge couplings  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that these combined effects improve the uv convergence of the gauge couplings relative to the situation in the minimal standard model .",
    "unfortunately , in models with gauge bosons in the bulk and the standard model higgs on the tev brane there are large tree - level corrections to precision electroweak observables  @xcite unless the tev brane scale @xmath13 is an order magnitude larger than the tev scale .",
    "thus , further model building is still needed to make non - supersymmetric warped guts viable .",
    "a common well founded criticism of rs type scenarios is based on the compelling unification of the gauge couplings in the mssm . at first sight",
    "it would seem that any new physics due to hidden dimensions at scales below the gut scale would ruin unification .",
    "for flat manifolds this is indeed true .",
    "however , if the compactified bulk is ads , logarithmic unification is not lost .",
    "thus it is possible to keep the usual 4d gut prediction for @xmath89 and yet still observe extra dimensions at the tev scale . in particular , it is possible that one could observe the kk modes of @xmath181 bosons at this scale and still not violate proton decay bounds  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have given a complete account of the systematics for the running of gauge couplings in compactified @xmath0 , including the one - loop effects of bulk scalar , fermion , and vector fields .",
    "in particular , we have explained how this miracle of effective 4d running can occur in terms of effective field theory arguments . from our analysis of planck brane gauge correlators",
    "emerges a simple set of rules for determining how the 5d field content of a given model contributes to the running of the couplings . in a large class of models ,",
    "one finds that bulk fields with zero modes with support on the planck brane will give rise to logarithms as in 4d field theories .",
    "we have also discussed the uv scales that appear in the predictions for @xmath89 when the warped gut is broken by either bulk higgs fields or by boundary ( orbifold or higgs ) effects . in the bulk higgs case , we find that the effects of massive bulk gauge bosons decouple at a scale which is parametrically suppressed by a power of @xmath161 relative to their naive bulk mass @xmath5",
    ". this could allow for the possibility of building models with two - step unification without loss of predicitivity , if one is willing to tolerate a slight hierarchy in @xmath182 .",
    "finally , we note that the mechanism employed here for understanding how the gauge couplings run in ads should also be applicable to determining the rg flows of other bulk couplings ( for instance yukawa couplings ) relevant to building models of grand unification based on the ads warp factor .",

    "<S> we give an effective field theory derivation , based on the running of planck brane gauge correlators , of the large logarithms that arise in the predictions for low energy gauge couplings in compactified @xmath0 backgrounds , including the one - loop effects of bulk scalars , fermions , and gauge bosons . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the case of charged scalars coupled to abelian gauge fields that has been considered previously in the literature , the one - loop corrections are not dominated by a single 4d kaluza - klein mode . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in the case of gauge field loops , the amplitudes can be reorganized into a leading logarithmic contribution that is identical to the running in 4d non - abelian gauge theory , and a term which is not logarithmically enhanced and is analogous to a two - loop effect in 4d . in a warped gut model broken by the higgs mechanism in the bulk , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the matching scale that appears in the large logarithms induced by the non - abelian gauge fields is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the bulk mass of the @xmath3 bosons and @xmath4 is the ads curvature . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the uv scale in the logarithmic contributions of scalars , which is simply the bulk mass @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are summarized in a set of simple rules that can be applied to compute the leading logarithmic predictions for coupling constant relations within a given warped gut model . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for both bulk higgs and boundary breaking of the gut gauge group . </S>"
