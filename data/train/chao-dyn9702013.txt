    "the time decay laws ( tdl ) of classical quasibounded hamiltonian systems use to include meaningful information related to the bounded transient dynamics . the feature of the tdl corresponding to a fully chaotic system has been well established . in a special way ,",
    "the tdl s are greatly sensible to the characteristic of the trapped periodic orbits .",
    "systems having a fully hyperbolic set of trapped periodic orbits show a purely exponential tdl , while the tdl becomes algebraic if they have a parabolic subset of them .",
    "so , in the case of the sinai billiard@xcite and the bunimovich stadium @xcite , paradigms of fully chaotic hamiltonian systems , the existence of the so called bouncing ball orbits ( parabolic and non isolated periodic orbits ) gives algebraic long time tails in the tdl s @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is a well known fact that the characteristic and the distribution of periodic orbits in bounded systems are relevant subjects to quantify semiclassically such systems@xcite .    to establish the influence of the periodic orbits in the decay of quantum systems , in the present work we have studied the decay processes in two quasibounded systems whose trapped periodic orbits have different characteristics .",
    "we show that the classical systems having trapped periodic orbits of different characteristics have qualitatively different tdl , while the quantum analogues do not show such sensitivity .",
    "in other words , we show that two classical systems with exponential and algebraic tdl respectively they have algebraic quantum tdl ( qtdl ) when they are considered as quantum systems .",
    "our work is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pres ] we introduce the classical systems whose tdl we study in sec .",
    "[ sec : tdl ] .",
    "[ sec : num ] is devoted to describe the quantum systems and the numerical method that we have employed to compute the qtdl . in sec .",
    "[ sec : decay ] we show the resulting qtdl . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we include one appendix to show some characteristics of the tdl s .",
    "in the present work we deal with a kind of one - dimensional periodically driven hamiltonians . the corresponding system can be described in the extended phase space@xcite as a conservative system with two degrees of freedom .",
    "let us consider non interacting point particles of unity mass moving inside a one - dimensional time dependent potential well    @xmath0    that is a perfectly reflecting one - dimensional box with an oscillating wall according to the time dependent law @xmath1",
    ".    looking at the graph of the position of one particle @xmath2 , as a function of time @xmath3 , we can see that the system is equivalent to a particle forwards in a two dimensional infinite pipe with appropriate reflecting conditions at the boundary ( see fig .",
    "[ cano](a ) ) . the reflecting condition ( the change of sign of the relative velocity between the walls and the particle ) imposes :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the velocity of the particle after ( before ) the collision .",
    "both velocities correspond to the sloops of the straight lines in the @xmath6 graphs ( @xmath7 ) .    let",
    "be @xmath1 periodic in time , so @xmath8 .    taking account the time lattice translation symmetry we can consider only an elemental segment of the channel setting periodic boundary conditions , namely @xmath9 so that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "so , the system can be seen as a two dimensional billiard where particles leaving at @xmath12 emerge at @xmath13 having the same velocity @xmath14 and the same position @xmath2 while the collisions at the walls follows the laws ( [ reflex ] ) . in this version of the system ,",
    "we have two degrees of freedom associated to the coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath15 \\tau$ ] ( reduced time ) where @xmath16 $ ] means the integer part ( see fig .  [ cano ] ( b ) ) . the conjugate momenta are @xmath14 and @xmath17 ( kinetic energy ) respectively .",
    "when the potential well is given by rule ( [ pozo ] ) particles inside the box are bounded despite their velocities . on the other hand ,",
    "if the oscillating wall ( at @xmath18 ) is a finite barrier of potential of height @xmath19 , particles with velocities @xmath20 will leave the well when they reach the wall . in this case , according to the characteristic of the dynamics , which is controlled by the law @xmath1 of the oscillating wall , the system can be transiently bounded .",
    "we have focused our attention in two particular rules @xmath1 . in the following",
    "we take @xmath21 as a unit of time and the mean value of @xmath22 as a unit of length and we take the energies as dimensionless ( that is they are divided by @xmath23 ) .    we have considered :    \\a ) harmonic oscillations    that is to say :    @xmath24",
    "this system resembles the so called full fermi accelerator model .",
    "such system was widely studied in simplified versions@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fermsec ] shows the poincare surface section for @xmath25 corresponding to the kinetic energy @xmath26 versus the @xmath27 .",
    "here we can distinguish three regions .",
    "the low energy region is fully chaotic , the intermediate energy region shows mixed dynamics ( regular island surrounded by the chaotic sea ) and finally the adiabatic region , where the dynamics become regular and we can see invariant curves .",
    "now we assume that the moving wall is a finite barrier of potential of height @xmath19 .",
    "so , the particles can leave the well and the limit between the bounded motion and the unbounded one is the line @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath19 lies on the adiabatic region , that is there is an invariant curve below the limit line , the system will remain bounded .",
    "so to study the tdl we will set @xmath19 less than the lower invariant curve .",
    "\\b ) sawtooth oscillations    in this case : @xmath29    the main feature of this system is that the periodic orbits are parabolic and non isolated . the two dimensional equivalent billiard is like billiards with neutral boundaries as polygonal ones@xcite .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ perio ] shows a representative periodic orbit .",
    "looking at the billiard as map @xmath30 @xmath31 the periodic orbit corresponds to a fixed point of @xmath32 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath33 has eigenvalues @xmath34 when it is linearized at this fixed point .",
    "so , it corresponds to a parabolic periodic orbit . on the other hand ,",
    "given a fixed point @xmath35 , it can be shown that there exists an interval of @xmath2 , @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 is a fixed point if @xmath38 .",
    "that is , the fixed points are non isolated .",
    "to study the tdl , we fill a portion of the bounded region with @xmath39 particles whose initial conditions are uniformly ( random ) distributed in @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "we compute the ratio @xmath40 of the remaining population as function of time .",
    "let us remark that the initial population must be chosen with low energy ( in the chaotic region ) to ensure the decay .",
    "if not so , particles can have initial conditions such that they will remain trapped because , in the case of harmonic oscillations , they can be on regular island included in the bounded region . on the other hand ,",
    "we want to exclude the population of the region corresponding to very low energy to minimize the effect of the asymptotic orbits to the ( trivial ) parabolic subset of periodic orbits characterized by @xmath41 . these trajectories are parallel lines to the time axis in the two dimensional pipe version of the system and they correspond to particles that having @xmath42 , they will never hit the boundary of the well ( see appendix ) .",
    "so we have considered @xmath43 figure  [ fermsec2 ] shows a part of the poincare surface section of fig .",
    "[ fermsec ] and the region that was initially populated .",
    "we have taken @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "figures  [ cltdl ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the results corresponding to the harmonic and sawtooth oscillations in log - lin and log - log plot respectively .",
    "we can see that the curves are quite different . in the case of fig .",
    "[ cltdl](a ) the log - lin plot shows an almost exponential behavior for the harmonic oscillations while fig .",
    "[ cltdl](b ) the log - log plot shows an algebraic one for the sawtooth oscillations .",
    "such a difference can be explain in terms of the features of the periodic orbits that are included in the trapped region@xcite . in the case of harmonic oscillations ,",
    "the trapped periodic orbits are hyperbolic and isolated ( aside the subset @xmath41 that was not initially populated ) while they are parabolic and non - isolated ( like the bouncing ball orbits of the sinai billiard ) for the sawtooth oscillations .",
    "we stress that the deviation of the exponential behavior in the case of harmonic oscillations can be attributed to the population of very low energy region by indirect way ( after collisions , see appendix ) .",
    "to study the quantum analogues of the systems , we want to solve the time dependent schroedinger equation . @xmath46",
    "the hamiltonian operator @xmath47 where :    @xmath48    we have employed an expectral method ( fast fourier transform , fft ) based on the split of the evolution operator @xmath49@xcite defined by @xmath50    this technique was widely applied to solve bounded systems @xcite , and transmission phenomena through moving barriers@xcite .",
    "such procedure does not avail with infinite barriers of potential , so to avoid the infinite barrier at @xmath25 , we have employed the symmetrized potential @xmath51 instead of potential ( [ pozo1 ] ) .",
    "we want to compute @xmath52 that is the probability to detect the particle inside the well at time @xmath3 .",
    "because the system can be unbounded we will have a non stationary leaving flux of probability going to @xmath53 .",
    "the spectral method automatically imposes periodic boundary conditions , so the flux of probability leaving at @xmath54 will appear as coming at @xmath55 .",
    "so we need to kill the leaving flux . to get this",
    "we have employed absorbing boundary conditions@xcite adding an absorptive ( purely imaginary ) static potential barrier @xmath56 to the actual ( real ) time dependent potential well [ pozo2 ] . here ,",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are real parameters whose values were chosen to minimize the reflection and transmission coefficients of @xmath59 .",
    "all computations were performed taking a time step @xmath60 on a grid of 4096 steps of spatial sampling @xmath61 .",
    "the absorbing region at the boundaries includes 250 spatial steps .",
    "this fact determines the value of @xmath58 .",
    "we have taken @xmath62 .",
    "figures  [ well ] summarizes the characteristic of the potential for the present calculation .    on the other hand",
    "we have change the sharp step function in the potential [ pozo2 ] by a soft version like a saxon - woods profile @xmath63 as was prescribed in ref .   to improve the convergence of the numerical method .",
    "we have found that to ensure convergence and stability , we need that the potential vary from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in two spatial steps @xmath66 .",
    "this determines the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "to populate the quantum system in an equivalent way as in the classical calculation , we consider the evolution of a quantum ensemble given by    @xmath68 is the number of eigenstates of the static well of deep @xmath69 whose eigenenergies lie on the region that we have populated the classical system .",
    "such number depends on the value of @xmath70 . setting an appropriate value we calculate @xmath71 we have compute ( [ proba ] ) taking @xmath72 . for this value",
    "there are ten bounded eigenstates of the static well whose eigenenergies are such that @xmath73 .    the results are shown in figure  [ qtdl ] a ) and b ) .",
    "the first shows a log - lin plot where we can see that both curves , corresponding to harmonic oscillations ( curve a ) and sawtooth oscillations ( curve b ) have non - exponential behavior .",
    "the second one shows a log - log plot that evidences an algebraic law from @xmath74 for both curves unlike to the classical behaviors where for the same time interval they are qualitatively different ( see fig .",
    "[ cltdl](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "let us remark that even algebraic ( @xmath75 ) , the characteristic exponents of the qtdl are quite different .",
    "the best fit for the qtdl corresponding to the harmonic oscillation system is @xmath76 while it is @xmath77 for the sawtooth oscillation system .",
    "we have studied the time decay laws of two quasibounded systems in the framework of classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "the classical results show that the tdl s of the two systems are qualitatively different .",
    "one of the tdl results exponential while the other is algebraic .",
    "this dissimilitude can be explain in term of the diverse characteristics of the trapped periodic orbits in the systems .",
    "on the other hand , the quantum systems do not show such difference . we have obtained algebraic qtdl for both systems .",
    "however , the characteristic exponents of the qtdl are different .    there are evidences that open quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic while they remain bounded ( with tdl almost exponential ) can originate algebraic qtdl @xcite with different characteristic exponents . this effect can be explained by the distribution ( gaussian ) of resonances , assuming an exponential decay of each resonance and an initial population of them . varying the initial population , different characteristic exponents can be obtained .",
    "such algebraic decay does not seem to be related to the existence of parabolic periodic orbits that generate algebraic tdl in classical systems@xcite . in our systems",
    ", the initial population is the same for both systems so we think that the different exponents can be originate by the distribution of antiresonances ( that is particular states that are refractory to absorb energy from the oscillating wall ) into each well .    on the other hand , in ref .",
    "it is shown that , in general , the qtdl corresponding to chaotic systems have a power long time tail ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the specific characteristic exponent @xmath78 , depends on the number of open channels for the decay . in particular , for one open channel the exponent is @xmath79@xcite .",
    "this fact , could be related to our result @xmath76 for the harmonic oscillating wall system . moreover ,",
    "the characteristic exponent @xmath78 , corresponding to non - chaotic systems for one open channel and strong coupling between quasibounded states and the continuum is closer to @xmath80@xcite because the widening of the distribution of resonance widths respect to those corresponding to chaotic systems .",
    "this result could be related to our result @xmath81 in the case of sawtooth oscillating wall system .",
    "these apparent connections are been studied .",
    "to finish , in spite of the classical systems and the quantum systems considered in the present work are not completely analogues ( essentially because the smoothing of the quantum potential ) , we expect that the tdl corresponding to the classical systems with the smoothing potential will be the same as the step potential systems . as we remark in sec .",
    "[ sec : tdl ] , the tdl for the classical systems is determined by the linear stability of the trapped periodic orbits and such characteristic seems to be related to the time dependence ( instead the spatial dependence ) of the potential .",
    "this work was partially supported by ubacyt(ex079 ) .",
    "we would like to thank e.vergini for useful suggestions .",
    "let us consider a well of deep @xmath19 .",
    "we have calculate the tdl starting off the uniform population of whole trapped region ( that is @xmath82 and @xmath83 . fig .",
    "[ alge](a ) shows the tdl as a function of time . here",
    ", we can see an algebraic behavior , that is @xmath84 where @xmath80 .",
    "according ref .",
    ", we expect a subset of periodic parabolic orbits included in the bounded region .",
    "this subset corresponds to particles that having @xmath85 generate trajectories which are asymptotic to the horizontal paths @xmath42 in the pipe version of our system .    to show this ,",
    "let us consider @xmath86 the fraction of initial conditions that spend a time @xmath87 greater than a given time @xmath3 , to reach the oscillating wall .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ cano2 ] , we estimate , for @xmath88 , @xmath89 so that @xmath90 following ref .  , we assume for the long time tail @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the fraction of initial conditions for the first collision with the moving wall occurs between @xmath3 and @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the probability to leave the wall after one collision . as @xmath95",
    "we have the law [ tdla ] for the tdl .",
    "we stress that in the case of fig .",
    "[ tdla ] the algebraic tail becomes for @xmath96 but in the general , if we populate the low energy region such that @xmath97 for long times as it shows in fig .",
    "[ alge](b ) .",
    "when the initial population excludes the very low energy region , that is @xmath98 , we have numerical evidence that the algebraic tail for long times follows @xmath99 ( see fig .  [ alge2 ] ) .",
    "so , it differs by one respect to the precedent .",
    "this difference also occurs in the decay of other quasibounded hamiltonian systems when a parabolic region is initially populated or it is populated by an indirect way in @xcite .",
