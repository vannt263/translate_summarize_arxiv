    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) have been attracting considerable attention as a promising candidate material for spintronics devices .",
    "the basic concept is to utilize spin polarized carriers created by strong exchange interaction between localized @xmath5-electrons of diluted magnetic ions and itinerant @xmath6-band electrons.@xcite since the discovery of room temperature ferromagnetism in co - doped anatase and rutile tio@xmath4 thin film,@xcite there have been a number of reports on high-@xmath7 ferromagnetism observed in various kinds of dms , particularly in oxides.@xcite co - doped tio@xmath4 is the material that has been studied most intensively .",
    "however , the origin of the ferromagnetism has not yet been elucidated .",
    "one of the experimental issues is whether the ferromagnetism indeed originates from the co spins that are randomly substituted on the ti sites , and not from the segregated co clusters .",
    "there have also been a number of reports that ascribe the ferromagnetism to the co segregation.@xcite    strong evidence in support of intrinsic ferromagnetism has been given by the observations of anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) and magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd).@xcite if the ferromagnetism were intrinsic , the charge carriers should be spin polarized due to the exchange interaction with the co spins . ahe and mcd",
    "are considered to probe the ferromagnetic response of the carriers introduced by the oxygen deficiency .",
    "in addition , rutile ti@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 has already been functionalized as a spin tunneling junction working up to 180 k.@xcite other studies that focus on this issue are mainly based on spectroscopic measurements such as x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) for samples in which no co segregation was recognized by imaging probes such as scanning electron microscope ( sem ) , atomic force microscope ( afm ) , and transmission electron microscopy ( tem).@xcite in these spectroscopic measurements , the spectral line shapes differ from that of co metal .",
    "they state that the local structure of the co site is close to those of co oxides such as cotio@xmath8 , in which the co ion is surrounded by six oxygen atoms , forming a coo@xmath9 cluster , and that the valence state of co is divalent .",
    "performed electron beam diffraction and composition analysis for anatase tio@xmath4 in a selected area without co segregation and confirmed both the diffraction peaks of tio@xmath4 and the existence of co.@xcite these results seem to support that the co ions randomly substitute on the ti sites .    although these spectroscopic methods provide valuable information on the local structure around co , however , they give little information on the crystallographic position of co and the orientation of the coo@xmath9 cluster : the former could be interstitial and the latter could be deformed due to the oxygen vacancy . in this context , we still do not have unambiguous evidence that co indeed substitutes for ti in a crystallographic sense .",
    "the fact that co is not soluble in tio@xmath4 in a thermodynamically stable manner also casts doubt on the assumption that co substitutes for ti.@xcite from a theoretical point of view , knowledge on the local structure of a co ion is of fundamental importance to construct a valid model and proceed the calculations on the electronic states of @xmath10 and @xmath6-band electrons .    in the present paper , we report on the results of x - ray diffraction utilizing anomalous scattering from co. this is a fundamentally different approach than spectroscopy .",
    "we observe a bragg peak as a result of the interference among the x rays scattered from many co ions in the sample and discuss the average crystallographic site of co in the tio@xmath4 lattice .",
    "if co substitute exactly on the ti site , the co ions have the same periodicity as the tio@xmath4 lattice and contribute to the bragg peak . our results on anatase and rutile co - doped tio@xmath4 films , however ,",
    "lead us to a conclusion that the co ions are not exactly located on the ti sites , implying a significant lattice deformation . on the other hand",
    ", it is shown that co indeed substitutes on the zn sites in paramagnetic co - doped zno thin films .",
    "the basic principle of the method is simple and direct .",
    "if the co ions of concentration @xmath11 randomly substitute on the ti sites of tio@xmath4 , the unit - cell structure - factor can be expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are the atomic scattering factors of ti , co , and o , respectively . @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the @xmath18-th atomic site of ti and o in the unit cell , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is the scattering vector . here , the atomic scattering factors are energy dependent and are generally expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the thomson scattering factor and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the real and imaginary parts , respectively , of the anomalous scattering factor , which exhibit a significant anomaly near an absorption edge of the element .",
    "therefore , when we measure the energy dependence of the intensity of a bragg reflection from the co - doped tio@xmath4 film , the intensity should exhibit an anomaly at the absorption edge of co if the structure factor involves @xmath14 .",
    "this measurement can be performed using a synchrotron radiation source , where the incident energy of the x rays can be varied .",
    "information of the crystal structures , reflection indices examined in the present experiment , and their structure factors are listed in table  [ table:1 ] . in rutile ,",
    "the ti atoms occupy the crystallographic site of @xmath24 : ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) and ( @xmath25 , @xmath25 , @xmath25 ) . in anatase , they are at the @xmath26 site : ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , @xmath25 , @xmath27 ) , ( @xmath25 , @xmath25 , @xmath25 ) , and ( @xmath25 , 0 , @xmath28 ) . the zn atoms of zno occupy the @xmath29 site of the wurtzite structure : ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , 0 ) and ( @xmath31 , @xmath30 , @xmath25 ) .

    "the films were deposited on tio@xmath4 buffered r - sapphire substrates by laser molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) .",
    "oxygen deficiency @xmath32 is controlled by the oxygen partial pressure varying from 10@xmath33 to 10@xmath34 torr . a systematic relationship among co concentration @xmath11 , oxygen partial pressure , carrier density , conductivity , ferromagnetic moment , ahe , and mcd",
    "is well established for these samples .",

    "the present experimental results unambiguously show that the atomic scattering factor of co is not included in the structure factor of either anatase or rutile ti@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "the co ions , on average , do not occupy the ti site nor any specific crystallographic site in the tio@xmath4 unit cell ; therefore , the interference among x - rays scattered from randomly distributed co ions are prevented .",
    "in contrast , from spectroscopic measurements such as xafs , xps and xmcd , it is concluded that the local environment of co is close to that of oxygen octahedron.@xcite in addition , the strong correlation among co concentration @xmath11 , oxygen deficiency @xmath32 , conductivity , ferromagnetism , ahe , and mcd investigated in refs .",
    "support that the carriers are associated with the ferromagnetism originating from the randomly distributed co ions .",
    "taking all these experimental results into consideration , we speculate that the doped co ions exist in a locally deformed structure , although they are randomly distributed in the sample without making a co metal - cluster . when a co@xmath36 ion is substituted for a ti@xmath45 in tio@xmath4 , an oxygen vacancy is necessarily created to maintain the charge neutrality . as a result ,",
    "the number of oxygen in the ligands becomes less than six,@xcite which would lead to a deformation of the local structure around co and a deviation of co from the exact ti site , i.e. , the @xmath24 site in rutile and the @xmath26 site in anatase .",
    "there is also a possibility that co substitutes for the interstitial sites among oxygen octahedrons . in rutile tio@xmath4 ,",
    "in particular , the interstitial occupation at positions such as ( @xmath25 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , @xmath25 , 0 ) , ( @xmath25 , 0 , @xmath25 ) , and ( 0 , @xmath25 , @xmath25 ) leads to a structure similar to the magneli phase as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , from which we may speculate that the interstitial site could be also stable for co.    , ( b ) rutile - tio@xmath4 , and ( c ) ti@xmath46o@xmath47 magneli phase.@xcite , width=283 ]    in order to examine if such a deformation could suppress the @xmath3-edge anomaly of co , we have made simulations assuming random shifts of the co ions from the ti site or the interstitial site .",
    "the result is demonstrated by the dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "the process of the simulation is as follows .",
    "first , 5% of co is doped into a super cell of @xmath48 unit cells , randomly substituting for the ti sites in anatase and the interstitial sites in rutile , respectively.@xcite at this stage , the anomaly as demonstrated by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] appears because the co ions occupy a specific crystallographic site and eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is valid .",
    "this is the first kind of randomness .",
    "next , we consider the second kind of randomness ; i.e. , one oxygen vacancy is randomly created in the local octahedron at the co site , and the co atom is shifted to the oxygen vacancy by 1    in anatase and 0.6    in rutile , respectively .",
    "then , we calculate @xmath49 for the super cell , which is shown by the dashed lines in the figures .",
    "although it is not our intention to emphasize that this is really the case , the second kind of randomness explains that the anomaly at the edge becomes very weak ; absence of the anomaly in the 103 reflection of anatase and 101 of rutile can also be explained . in this simulation ,",
    "the weakened anomaly is associated with the increased number of possible co sites by a factor six as a result of the second kind of randomness .",
    "there should also be a tilting of the octahedron due to the vacancy , which would weaken the anomaly even more because it further increases the possible positions and weakens the correlation among the co sites ; the relatively large shift values assumed above can be reduced .",
    "the spectroscopic measurements , which analyze the local structural environment on average , may hide information on this kind of deformation we considered here . in the case of zn@xmath0co@xmath1o ,",
    "on the other hand , oxygen vacancy is not necessary when doping because both zn and co are divalent ; then , there arises little deformation in the local structure and the doped co sits exactly on the zn site , which is the prerequisite for eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .    to search for possible deformed structure or another phase that could contain co such as the magneli phase",
    ", we performed additional x - ray diffraction experiment using an imaging plate debye - scherrer camera installed at beamline 1b .",
    "however , no other phase was detected as a diffraction peak with its intensity higher than @xmath50% of the strongest peak of rutile or anatase structure of the tio@xmath4 film .",
    "therefore , the deformed structure , if it existed , is suspected to be short ranged and randomly oriented , which only gives rise to incoherent scattering .",
    "although the position and the local structure of co is still uncertain , our experimental results support a theoretical investigation that the oxygen vacancy near co induces structural deformation and enhances the spin density associated with the ferromagnetism.@xcite a recent theoretical model for high-@xmath7 ferromagnetism in oxide dms is also based on the oxygen vacancy , which causes impurity band exchange.@xcite elucidation of the microscopic structure around co and its relation with the mechanism of the ferromagnetism is strongly required . structural analysis by x - ray fluorescence holography , which determines the three dimensional atomic arrangement around the fluorescing atom ,",
    "could solve this problem.@xcite",
    "by utilizing x - ray anomalous dispersion , we have directly examined whether the doped co ions substitute for ti in anatase and rutile ti@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 for well characterized thin - film samples exhibiting intrinsic high-@xmath7 ferromagnetism .",
    "although the intensity of the bragg reflections should exhibit an anomaly at the @xmath3-edge of co if the co ions were randomly substituted exactly on the ti site , no anomaly was detected in the experiment , indicating that the co ions are not located exactly on the ti site .",
    "however , the fluorescence spectra show that the co ions exist in the sample in a certain form ; xps and xmcd spectra on the identical sample support that the co ions are randomly distributed and are surrounded by the oxygens .",
    "these contrasting results suggest that the local structure around co is strongly deformed , leading to a significant shift of co from the high symmetry positions of ti sites or interstitials , probably because of the oxygen vacancy .",
    "we have proposed a scenario how the anomaly disappears by the local deformations . on the other hand , in our paramagnetic zn@xmath0co@xmath1o thin film ,",
    "the substitution of co for the zn sites has been verified .",
    "these results may imply a significant role of lattice deformation for the high-@xmath7 ferromagnetism in oxide dms s .",
