    "the 3.3 ghz @xmath4-doubling lines of the methylidyne radical ch have been commonly used to trace low density gas in diffuse clouds and at the boundaries of dense clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they have also been observed extensively toward translucent clouds , bright limbed clouds , outflows , and dark clouds .",
    "many of such surveys have shown a linear correlation between the ch column density and the visual extinction in diffuse and translucent clouds .",
    "ch is therefore recognized as a powerful tracer of molecular hydrogen , tightly correlated with molecular hydrogen in terms of column density @xmath5/[h_{2 } ] = 3.5\\times10^{-8}$ ] @xcite . however , in a high spatial resolution observation of two high - latitude translucent clouds mbm 3 and 40 with the arecibo telescope , @xcite found a slight spatial offset between the distribution of ch and that of co , possibly due to the chemical evolution of carbon . at higher visual extinctions ,",
    "ch is consumed by the carbon chemistry in relatively dense molecular environments .",
    "thus , ch observations can not supplant co for studying high - visual - extinction clouds such as dark clouds or giant molecular clouds .",
    "owing to different formation routes , ch can exist in both high and low density gas . in high density gas",
    ", ch can be formed through the following chains of reactions @xcite : @xmath6 when the amount of ionized carbon ( [ cii ] ) is substantial , ch formation is believed to be triggered by the radiative synthesis of [ cii ] with vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen 2  ( as described in equation  ( [ chreact ] ) ) in the outer layers of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , where the chemical evolution is dominated by uv radiation .",
    "observationally , the evidence for the above equations has been inconclusive ( see e.g.  the 3p  observation toward cyg ob2 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in lower density material ( @xmath7 3 ) , ch can also be produced through  synthesis , @xmath8 propelled by mhd shocks @xcite .",
    "ch is thus considered to be a tracer of mhd shocks , especially the c - type shocks @xcite .",

    "they believed that turbulent chemistry gives rise to the overabundance of ch and  in these clouds .",
    "@xcite found uv irradiation rather than shock chemistry playing a key role in  formation in orion bn / kl .",
    "the boundary of molecular clouds is the region in which c - shock may take place @xcite . a clear example of cloud boundaries can be found in taurus @xcite , northeast of the tmc1 region with a visual extinction ranging from 0.4 to 2.7 mag , and is thus an ideal target to study ch as a molecular tracer in the transition zone between diffuse and dense gas . @xcite",

    "the locations of the positions for the telescope pointing used to study the tbr are shown in figure  [ fig.cut_ra_dec ] . to examine the transition zone with a higher signal - to - noise ratio , we averaged all five cuts of spectra of ch 3335 , 3264 , 3349 mhz , oh 1612 , 1665 , 1667 , 1720 mhz ,  j = 1 - 0 , and 3co  j = 1 - 0 , as shown in figure  [ fig.channel_map ] .",

    ", the central velocities of blue components gradually shift from 5.4  at position 9 to 5.8  at position 13 , which indicates that the collision of two streams results in the final central velocity being located between the velocities of the two components .",
    "the central velocity of the final combined stream is located closer to the blue components , which have stronger emission lines in tbr - i .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption of different amounts of 3co  emission at different velocities .    the change of the line width of ch 3335 mhz , oh 1665 mhz ,  j=1 - 0 and 3co  j=1 - 0 along the cut direction is shown in figure  [ fig.width_all ] .",

    "@xcite pointed out that , owing to the different response of neutral and ionized species to the presence of a magnetic field , the  and ch formed in the hot post - shock gas can differ significantly in velocities .",
    "if shock waves propagate across the tbr , different neutral molecules obtain different velocities owing to their different cross section .",
    "we find a slightly different central velocities of ch , oh and  across the tbr in figure  [ fig.vel_all ] , which may be the result of the propagation of c - shock .",

    "when using the value of @xmath49 k from , which is widely used for dark clouds , @xmath50 increases by about 11% .",
    "the uncertainty in ch column density associated with the assumptions of @xmath37 is thus small .",
    "the assumption that the @xmath4-doubling lines of ch are optically thin can be problematic , which can be seen from the relative intensities of the three components ( figure  [ fig.channel_map ] ) . both satellite lines should be two times weaker than the main component , but the observed intensities of satellite lines are often larger .",
    "furthermore , the intensity of the two observed satellite lines are not equal .",
    "thus , we can not precisely calculate the optical depth of ch .",
    "the correction factor for optical depth is defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the optical depth of the main @xmath4-doubling line .",
    "the line ratio between the satellite line and the main line ranges from 0.5 to 0.9 , resulting in @xmath53 .",
    "considering all the factors above ( including @xmath37 and @xmath52 ) , the ch column density can be underestimated by as much as a factor of 3 .",
    "based on dust extinction and total gas column density provided by previous studies @xcite , we examine the evolution of ch across tbr in terms of @xmath54-factor .",
    "we show the correlation of the integrated intensity @xmath55 ( in k ) of ch 3335 mhz , oh 1665 mhz and  1 - 0 versus the visual extinction in figure  [ fig.av_x ] . over a wide visual extinction range ( 0.4 - 2.7 mag ) , w(co ) and",
    "w(oh ) correlate better with @xmath56 than w(ch ) does .",
    "but in a more limited extinction range between 0.8 and 2.1 mag , more appropriate for a translucent cloud and/or the transition zone of a dark cloud , there is a better correlation between w(ch ) and @xmath56 than those between w(oh ) , w(co ) and @xmath56 . to better examine these relationships",
    ", we adopt the usual definition of `` @xmath54-factor '' , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the column density of 2  and w is the integrated intensity of the molecular tracers ch , oh , co. we plot the correlation of `` @xmath54-factor '' of ch , oh and co versus the visual extinction in figure  [ fig.av_x ] . when the visual extinction @xmath56 is in the range between 0.8 and 2.1 mag ,",
    "the @xmath59-factor is almost a constant of @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the dispersion of ch @xmath54-factor is visibly less than those of oh and co at @xmath0 mag .",
    "ch appears to be a better tracer of molecular gas than co and oh in the transition zone ( @xmath0 mag ) . where extinction drops below 1 mag in tbr , the integrated intensities w of the three molecules lie above the overall fitting lines , indicating a stronger intensity of these spectra , which is likely the result of c - shock in the tbr - o ( section  [ ch abundance and c - shock model ] ) .",
    "we have calculated the column density of ch in section  [ ch column density ] . the column density of ch across the tbr is shown in figure  [ fig.ch_col ] . found a good correlation between the ch column density and visual extinction for diffuse , dark molecular cloud @xmath60 as the dashed line shows in figure  [ fig.ch_col ] .",
    "this correlation is reasonable considering the ch formation threshold , which requires substantial 2  @xcite . the derived column density of ch below 1 mag extinction ( blue shade in figure  [ fig.ch_col ] ) in tbr obviously lies above the typical value observed by .",
    "furthermore , considering the correction factor for excitation temperature and optical depth ( as discussed in section  [ ch column density ] ) , the actual column density of ch in tbr - o is likely to be even larger by an additional factor of 3 .",
    "the true ch column density in tbr - o can thus be one order of magnitude higher than the simple extension from the @xmath54-factor for higher extinctions .",
    "we compared the ch column density with the prediction of c - shock models .",
    "@xcite made a prediction that ch column density would increase from @xmath61 to @xmath62 cm  when extinction increases from 0.1 to 1 mag at a c - shock front , which matches exactly the measured values here .",
    "@xcite also found an overabundance of oh below 1 mag extinction ( by a factor of 80 ) .",
    "the overabundance of ch and oh suggests that there may be an additional channel of ch and oh production , possibly due to the shock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) produced by the colliding streams ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  4 ) . when shock waves propagate through the molecular ism , the gas is compressed , heated , and accelerated .",

    "@xcite also ruled out pdr models due to non - detection of [ cii ] in trr - o .",
    "if temperature is above 300 k , the neutral - neutral reactions become important , which can also result in the overabundance of oh @xcite .",
    "we compared the ch column density with uv - driven pdr models .",
    "@xcite found that a steady - state uv - driven pdr chemistry with radiation field @xmath64 ( in draine units ) , rather than a shock chemistry , plays a key role in  formation in orion bn / kl .",
    "however , the tbr has a relatively low uv field between @xmath30 and 0.8 @xcite .",
    "when the radiation field strength declines , the number density of  decreases around @xmath65 mag @xcite . and made a pdr model with a relatively low radiation field with @xmath66 .",
    "neither model can form as much ch as in our observations .",
    "in particular , made predictions of ch column density in a uv - driven chemistry simulation with radiation field of @xmath67 .",
    "the observed ch column density is still 2 - 3 times lager than their predictions . as discussed in section  [ ch column density ] , the actual column density of ch in tbr - o is likely to still be larger by another factor of 3",
    ". the observed ch column density can thus be as much as 6 - 9 times larger than that of uv - driven simulation .",
    "uv photons should play only a limited role in producing ch in a relatively low radiation field such as in the tbr .    besides the c - shock model and uv - driven pdr model , and @xcite observed optical ch and  lines in several stars but found their line profiles are inconsistent with shock theories , and predict a significant velocity difference between neutral and ionized species , as discussed in section  [ spectral analysis ] .",
    "they believed that turbulent chemistry may play a key role in the overabundant of ch and  in these clouds . since we do not have ionized species data ( e.g. )",

    "oh , and  have mildly different central velocities ( figure  [ fig.vel_all ] ) , consistent with the propagation of c - shock .",
    "most turbulent dissipation region models predict two orders of magnitude more  than the pdr model , which could explain the overabundance of ch in tbr - o .",
    "if the region is turbulence dominated , the line width of different molecules is likely to have a linear relation .",
    "but in figure  [ fig.width_all ] , the line width of ch , oh ,  and 3co  dose not show clear correlation in tbr - o , which does not support turbulence dissipation .",
    "we have mapped a sharp boundary region of the taurus molecular cloud in all three ground - state transitions of the methylidyne ( ch ) radical with the arecibo telescope .",
    "a combined analysis of ch data with oh ,  j = 1 - 0 , 3co  j = 1 - 0 , and dust leads to the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "ch has two kinematic components .",
    "one component shifts from 5.3 to 6  going from outside to inside , both of which match well with those of oh .",
    "the shifting of the two kinematic components indicates colliding streams or gas flow at the boundary region .",
    "the derived ch abundance across the boundary is consistent with the previous observation for @xmath0 mag , but overabundant by as much as one order of magnitude below 1 mag extinction .",
