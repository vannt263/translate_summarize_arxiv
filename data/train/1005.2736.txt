    "the minimally extended standard model predicts a very small magnetic moment for the massive neutrino ( @xmath8 ) which can not be observed in any experiment at present . on the other hand",
    ", there is a number of extensions of the theory beyond the minimal standard model where the _ majorana _ neutrino magnetic moment ( nmm ) could be at a level of @xmath9  @xmath10 irrespectively of the neutrino mass @xcite . at the same time , from general considerations @xcite it follows that the _ dirac _ nmm can not exceed @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , observation of the nmm value higher than @xmath12  @xmath10 would be evidence for new physics and , in addition , would indicate @xcite doubtless that the neutrino is a majorana particle .",
    "it is rather important to make laboratory nmm measurements sensitive enough to reach the @xmath1310@xmath14 region .",
    "the savanna river experiment by reines group could be considered the beginning of such measurements . over a period of thirty years the sensitivity of reactor experiments only increased by a factor of three : from @xmath15@xcite to @xmath16@xcite .",
    "similar limits were obtained for solar neutrinos@xcite , but due to oscillations at long distance ( as well as matter - enhanced oscillations in the sun ) their flavor composition changes and therefore the solar nmm results could differ from the reactor ones .    in this paper ,",
    "the results of a 3-year nmm measurement being performed by the collaboration of itep ( moscow ) and jinr ( dubna ) are presented .",
    "measurements are carried out with the _ gemma _ spectrometer@xcite at the 3  gw@xmath0 reactor of the kalinin nuclear power plant ( knpp ) .",
    "a laboratory measurement of the nmm is based on its contribution to the @xmath4-@xmath17 scattering . for nonzero nmm",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath17 differential cross section is given @xcite by a sum of the _ weak _ interaction cross section ( @xmath18 ) and the _ electromagnetic _ cross section ( @xmath19 ) :    ( 165,52)(0,0 ) ( 0,-2 )    @xmath20,\\\\   \\end{array}\\ ] ]    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the incident neutrino energy , @xmath23 is the electron recoil energy , @xmath24 is the weinberg angle and @xmath25 is the electron radius ( @xmath26 @xmath3 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig.w / em ] shows differential cross sections ( [ eq.dsw/dt ] ) and ( [ eq.dsem/dt ] ) averaged over the typical antineutrino reactor spectrum vs the electron recoil energy .",
    "one can see that at a low recoil energy ( @xmath27 ) the value of @xmath18 becomes almost constant , while @xmath19 behaves as @xmath28 , so that the lowering of the detector threshold leads to a considerable increase in the nmm effect with respect to the weak unremovable contribution .    to realize this useful feature in our gemma spectrometer@xcite",
    ", we use a 1.5 kg hpge detector with an energy threshold as low as 3 kev . to be sure that there is no efficiency cut at this energy ,",
    "the `` hard '' trigger threshold is made twice lower ( 1.5 kev ) .",
    "( 140,80)(0,0 ) ( 5,2 ) ( 85,0 ) ( 0,-1.5 )    the background is suppressed in several steps .",
    "first , the detector is placed inside a cup - like nai crystal with 14 cm thick walls surrounded with 5 cm of electrolytic copper and 15 cm of lead ( fig .",
    "[ fig.setup ] ) .",
    "active and passive shielding reduces the external @xmath29-background in the roi to a level of @xmath30  counts / kev / kg / day . being located just under reactor # 2 of the knpp ( at a distance of 13.9 m from the reactor core , which corresponds to an antineutrino flux of @xmath31 ) , the detector is well shielded against the hadronic component of cosmic rays by the reactor body and technological equipment ( overburden@xmath3270 m w.e . ) .",
    "the muon component is also reduced by a factor of @xmath1310 at @xmath33 with respect to the vertical direction and of @xmath133 at @xmath34 , but a part of the residual muons are captured in the massive shielding and thus produce neutrons which scatter elastically in ge and give rise to a low - energy background . to suppress this background ,",
    "the spectrometer is covered with additional plastic scintillator plates ( ps ) which produce relatively long @xmath35-veto signals .",
    "special care is taken to reduce non - physical low - amplitude circuit noise ( afterpulses , radio frequency interference , microphonism , etc . ) .",
    "thus , for example , the detector signal is processed by three parallel independent electronic channels with different shaping time ( 2 , 4 and 12 @xmath35s ) , which allows a primitive fourier analysis @xcite to be performed  posteriori , so artefact signals are discriminated ( see the next section ) .",
    "in order to get a recoil electron spectrum , we use a differential method comparing the spectra measured during the reactor operation ( on ) and shutdown ( off ) periods . in our previous work",
    "we considered phase - i ( 13 months measurement from 08.2005 to 09.2006 , including 5184 and 1853 hours of the reactor on and off periods , respectively ) . today",
    "we can add phase - ii ",
    "19 months from 09.2006 to 05.2008 .",
    "unfortunately , for some organizational and technical reasons , there were several interruptions in the measurement . after the preliminary selection described below , 6798 on - hours and 1021 off - hours of active time",
    "were found to be available for analysis .    during the measurements , the signals of the hpge detector ,",
    "anticompton nai shielding and outer anticosmic plastic counters , as well as the dead - time information , are collected on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the neutrino flux monitoring in the on period is carried uot via the reactor thermal power measured with an accuracy of 0.7% .",
    "the collected data are processed in several steps .",
    "the first step involves different selections aimed at suppressing nonphysical and physical backgrounds :    1 .",
    "* bad run * rejection .",
    "we reject those one - hour runs which correspond to the periods of liquid nitrogen filling and any mechanical or electrical work at the detector site , as they could produce noise .",
    "* radioactive noble gas * rejection .",
    "unfortunately , the detector shielding turned out to be not tight enough against radioactive noble gases .",
    "to smooth away this design defect , we analyze energy spectra measured during each several hours and check the stability of the @xmath29-background .",
    "if any visible excess of 81  kev ( @xmath36xe ) , 250  kev ( @xmath37xe ) or 1294  kev ( @xmath38ar ) @xmath29-line occurs , the corresponding runs are removed .",
    "* detector noise * rejection . for some obscure reasons our ge detector happened to become noisy from time to time . in order to reject these noisy periods ,",
    "the low - amplitude count rate is checked second by second , and those seconds which contain more than 5 events with @xmath392  kev are rejected .",
    "audio - frequency * rejection .",
    "we reject those events which are separated by a time interval shorter than 80  ms or equal to ( @xmath40 )  ms . in such a way we suppress the noise caused by mechanical vibrations ( `` ringing '' ) and the 50  hz power - line frequency .",
    "* fourier * rejection .",
    "as it was mentioned , the real and artefact signals have different fourier spectra .",
    "to exploit this difference , we build three plots similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.matrix ] : ( @xmath41 vs @xmath42 ) , ( @xmath43 vs @xmath41 ) and ( @xmath42 vs @xmath43 ) .",
    "+ ( 140,65)(0,0 ) ( 0,-3)s pulses , and adc-3 operates with 12  @xmath35s pulses . plot ( a ) is made _ before _ and ( b )  _ after _ the `` audio - frequency '' rejection ; it is seen that most of the rejected events are non - diagonal .",
    "( the color intensity scale is logarithmic.),title=\"fig : \" ] + the real signal falls into diagonals ( @xmath44 ) within the energy resolution , whereas any nonphysical artefact shows a different pattern",
    ". we only select _ diagonal _ events and thus additionally reject low- and high - frequency noise . to ensure the lowest cut - off",
    ", we replace @xmath42 , @xmath41 and @xmath43 by their linear combination @xmath45 : @xmath46 where the amplitudes @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are chosen ( subjectively ) so as to make the vector @xmath45 be antiparallel to the noise gradient ( fig .  [ fig.matrix]b ) .    after the above rejections we construct energy spectra for the on and off periods and",
    "correct them in two steps :    1 .",
    "* noble gas * correction .",
    "as our spectrometer is not located in a special laboratory , but in the _ technological room _ , there are sometimes short operational periods when the concentration of @xmath38ar , @xmath36xe and @xmath37xe in this room becomes higher than usual .",
    "spectra measured under these conditions are used to evaluate the contribution of each radioactive gas to the low - energy part of the background .",
    "these contributions normalized to the intensities of the corresponding @xmath29-lines are then subtracted from those few on and off spectra where small traces of these lines are still present . in this case",
    "the value of such correction in the roi does not exceed 1 - 2% .",
    "* low - energy threshold * correction .",
    "the detection efficiency @xmath50 just above the threshold @xmath51 is measured with a pulser and fitted with the function @xmath52 where @xmath53 stands for the detector energy resolution .",
    "experimental spectra are then corrected by the function ( [ eq.threshold ] ) which in our case becomes significant at energies below 2.8 kev .    as a result",
    ", we obtain energy spectra @xmath54 for the on and off periods which must be normalized to the corresponding active times @xmath55 and @xmath56 and then compared to each other , taking into account the additional neutrino - dependent term : @xmath57 this term includes the fiducial detector mass @xmath58 and the antineutrino flux @xmath59 ( known with an accuracy of 1.7% and 3.5% , respectively ) multiplied by the sum of two neutrino contributions : the weak one ( @xmath60 ) , which can be calculated easily by formula ( [ eq.dsw/dt ] ) and is completely negligible in our case , and the electromagnetic one ( @xmath61 ) , which is proportional to the squared nmm value : @xmath62    unfortunately , the on and off periods are not equal from the point of view of statistics .",
    "a usual off period is much shorter , and , therefore , the final sensitivity is limited by the background uncertainties .",
    "on the other hand , today , after three years of data taking , we know the roi background structure with more confidence .",
    "it gives us the right to introduce additional information in our analysis , namely , to state that our background is _ a smooth curve_.    to implement this conventional idea , we fit the background off spectrum in the roi from 2.9 kev to 55 kev with a parametrized smooth function ( a sum of gaussian , exponential and linear functions ) or with splines ; these fits produce slightly different results , and their spread is taken into account by the final systematic error .",
    "then we compare the on spectrum channel by channel with the obtained background curve and extract the @xmath63-value ( or its upper limit ) from eq.([eq.on = off+nu ] ) .",
    "this evaluation is more complicated than expected because it is very difficult to count active times @xmath55 and @xmath56 precisely in a proper way ( especially , after numerous selections of the events ) . to avoid possible errors caused by this procedure",
    ", we divide the active time normalization into two parts : absolute ( @xmath55 ) and relative ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "roughly both the @xmath55 and @xmath56 active times are estimated using several background @xmath29-lines : the 238  kev line of @xmath65pb , the 1173  kev and 1333  kev lines of @xmath66co and the 1461  kev line of @xmath67k .",
    "this radiation originates from the pollution of the internal parts of the spectrometer and is therefore more - or - less stable in time and does not depend on the reactor operation . comparing the intensities of the above lines measured _ with _ and _ without _ any selections , we get the estimates @xmath68 , @xmath69 with accuracy of 0.9% and 1.9% , respectively .",
    "this is not enough , however , to evaluate the @xmath70 value with the required precision .",
    "we resolve this problem in the following way .",
    "the relative on / off time factor @xmath70 is represented as a product of its estimate @xmath71 ( which is a constant known with a bad accuracy of 2.1% ) and a correction factor @xmath72 ( which should be not far from 1.0 ) : @xmath73 . then eq .  ( [ eq.on=off+nu ] )",
    "can be transformed to @xmath74 as it is seen , the absolute time normalization @xmath55 contributes to the final result in the same way as @xmath59 or @xmath58 ( i.e. , simply as a _ factor _ ) and therefore we can replace @xmath55 by its estimate @xmath68 .",
