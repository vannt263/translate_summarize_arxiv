    ", the most direct approach follows the photoinduced changes of the cdw spectral features , namely the closing of the cdw gap or the disappearance of the cdw backfolded bands directly in the time - domain .",
    "many studies have focussed on the first hundred femtoseconds following the photoexcitation , in order to figure out whether these changes occur faster or not than the lattice motion related to the structural distortion , the timing of which is given by the period of the relevant phonon mode .",
    "the recovery dynamics of cdw order have received less attention , however we will show below that they also provide fundamental information on the role of electronic and phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "cdw materials undergo a low temperature phase transition resulting in a new translational periodicity in the electronic density ( the cdw ) , as well as a periodic lattice distortion ( pld ) .",
    "one of these materials , 1_t_-tise@xmath0 , undergoes a peculiar second - order cdw transition@xcite below @xmath1 k. the mechanism of its cdw transition has been debated intensively over the last decades , in terms of either an electronic @xcite or a structural origin @xcite .",
    "time - resolved techniques seem to give a decisive answer by focussing on the ultrafast melting of the cdw and pld and disentangling the roles of electrons and lattice on the femtosecond timescale @xcite .",
    "these studies are consistent with a purely electronic mechanism of the cdw transition in 1_t_-tise@xmath0 , which might be an instability towards an excitonic insulator phase . in such a scenario , electrons and holes from distinct low - energy bands ,",
    "are bound together in excitons by the interband coulomb interaction and their macroscopic spontaneous condensation at low temperature leads to a new ground state @xcite .",
    "a recent ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy study@xcite stressed the importance of the lattice degree of freedom , which is shown to stabilize the cdw phase together with the excitonic mechanism . in parallel , a few theoretical models@xcite have demonstrated that the cdw ( and its concomitant pld ) can be cooperatively stabilized by both the interband coulomb interaction and the electron - phonon coupling . in the light of these recent studies , what is then",
    "the role of the excitonic mechanism in 1_t_-tise@xmath0 ? does is alone provoke the cdw instability or does it merely assist the lattice in driving the cdw transition ?    here",
    ", in order to address these questions , we investigate the femtosecond dynamics of both the recovery of the cdw phase in 1_t_-tise@xmath0  at 30 k , as well as of high - temperature cdw fluctuations at 240 k , which precedes the cdw instability .",

    "above @xmath2 , we single out a fast component in the recovery of the cdw correlations with a relaxation time @xmath3 100 fs . we interpret it as the consequence of the ultrafast recovery from the screening of the coulomb interaction responsible for the electron - hole correlations , which precedes the cdw phase transition .",
    "the observation of these two contributions - the coherent oscillations of the cdw amplitude mode at low temperature and the ultrafast electronic recovery at high temperature - supports the idea that both the interband coulomb interaction and the electron - phonon coupling cooperatively stabilize the cdw phase ( and the concomitant pld ) in 1_t_-tise@xmath0 .",
    "the paper is divided into two main parts : in part [ sec_lt ] , we study the low temperature ( 30 k ) cdw phase using a mid - infrared excitation .",
    "we show how the excitation generates a direct optical transition between the backfolded valence and conduction bands in section [ subsec_lt_res ] .",
    "the resulting coherent oscillation of the amplitude mode is then analyzed and explained as the result of a bonding - antibonding optical transition in section [ subsec_lt_phonon ] .",
    "part [ sec_rt ] shows the results obtained for the cdw fluctuation regime at 240 k using a near - infrared excitation .",
    "we demonstrate that the excitation generates a direct transition at the center of the brillouin zone in section [ subsec_rt_res ] and subsequently induces a change in the spectral function of the conduction band ( section [ subsec_rt_sw ] ) .",

    "the combination of these two observations explains the bi - exponential decay of the photoemission intensity suppression at the bottom of the cb ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( e ) ) , namely the recovery of the cdw fluctuations .",
    "we ascribe the fast component ( @xmath53 fs ) to the relaxation of the enhanced screening by the efficient electron - hole scattering and the slow component to a quasi - thermal recovery following the relaxation of the electronic temperature .",
    "our interpretation that the fast component is due to the electron - hole correlations as a strong scattering channel supports their occurence at temperature above but near @xmath2 .",
    "these correlations give rise to the cdw fluctuations in this temperature range@xcite and play an important role in stabilizing the low - temperature cdw phase .    at 30 k ,",
    "the situation is different as a well - formed pld is present .",
    "the longer timescale dynamics of the cdw band display a clear response of the lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath13 cdw amplitude mode is observed as a coherent phonon oscillation , provided that the cdw band is selectively excited by a resonant mir photon pulse generating excited electrons with a minimal excess kinetic energy with respect to the cdw gap .",
    "the fact that the intensity of the cdw band oscillates with the frequency of the @xmath13 cdw - related phonon mode implies that the order parameter of the cdw phase is strongly coupled to the corresponding atomic motion .",
    "furthermore , this coupling is very localized in momentum space , namely only for states in the cdw band .",
    "this means that both the excitonic interband coulomb interaction and the electron - phonon coupling contribute to the order parameter of the cdw phase @xcite .",
    "in the first 100 fs , the melting of the cdw order is dominated by the suppression of the excitonic part , as observed by rohwer _",
    "@xcite with rise times as fast as 20 fs for large fluences ( up to 5 mj/@xmath10 ) .    in that sense ,",
    "our experimental results support a model according to which strong electron - hole correlations , giving rise to short - range cdw fluctuations above @xmath2 , contribute to the stabilization of the cdw phase together with the electron - phonon coupling below @xmath2@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have probed both the femtosecond dynamics of the cdw phase in 1_t_-tise@xmath0  at 30 k , as well as the dynamics of the high - temperature fluctuation regime at 240 k using trarpes . below @xmath2 , in the cdw phase , we observe the coherent oscillation of the cdw amplitude mode for the first time with trarpes using a mid - infrared excitation resonant with the cdw gap . above @xmath2 , we single out a fast component with a relaxation time @xmath3 100 fs . we interpret it as the consequence of the ultrafast screening of the interband coulomb interaction responsible for the electron - hole correlations .",
    "we propose that these electron - hole correlations act as an efficient scattering channel in the relaxation of excited electrons . in this way",
    ", we have unveiled the dynamics of both the electron and lattice degrees of freedom in 1_t_-tise@xmath0 .",
