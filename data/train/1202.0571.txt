    "the notion of _ measure equivalence _ between groups was introduced by m. gromov @xcite , as an analog of quasi - isometry in the context of actions on measure spaces .",
    "it has been widely studied since then , for example the works of dye @xcite , @xcite , ornstein and weiss @xcite , and furman @xcite characterized the measure class of @xmath0 , found to be exactly the infinite amenable groups .",
    "this motivates the study of which groups are measure equivalent to the non - abelian free groups , @xmath1 with @xmath2 ( which are all virtually isomorphic , thus measure equivalent ) . in this paper",
    "we will work with the notion of _ treeability _ , in the sense of pemantle and peres @xcite , which is equivalent to being measure equivalent to a free group , as shown by g. hjorth @xcite .",
    "the concept of _ measure free factor _ ( definition [ mffdef ] ) was introduced by d. gaboriau in @xcite , as a tool for the study of measure equivalence .",
    "he was able to find many groups that are measure equivalent to the free group @xmath3 , by showing that this class is closed under certain amalgamated products .",
    "namely , those amalgamations @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a measure free factor of either @xmath6 or @xmath7 ( see [ amalgam ] for the precise statement ) . in this work , gaboriau @xcite poses the question of which elements of @xmath3 generate a cyclic measure free factor .",
    "he shows that such an element can not be a proper power , and also finds the first non - trivial example ( see [ surface1 ] ) .",
    "gaboriau s results were then used by m. bridson , m. tweedale and h. wilton @xcite to prove that hyperbolic _",
    "limit groups _",
    "( defined by z. sela @xcite ) are measure equivalent to @xmath3 .",
    "this provides a wide set of examples of groups in the measure equivelence class of @xmath3 , and it naturally raises the question of whether all non - abelian limit groups are in this class . the importance of measure free factors in the study of this problem is explained in that same work @xcite , and it arises from the structure of limit groups as iterated amalgamations and hnn extensions , found by z. sela @xcite and o. kharlampovich and a. myasnikov @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , new measure free factors of free or limit groups give rise to more limit groups in the measure class of @xmath3 .",
    "this work advances the study of measure free factors of free groups , by finding some new infinite families of elements of @xmath1 that generate cyclic measure free factors of @xmath1 .",
    "namely , we prove the following .    * [ bswords ] * let @xmath8 be a free group of rank @xmath9 .",
    "then an element of the form @xmath10 generates a measure free factor of @xmath11 .    *",
    "[ twoletters ] * let @xmath12",
    ". then an element of the form @xmath13 for @xmath14 generates a measure free factor of @xmath15 .",
    "since conjugates of measure free factors are also measure free factors , theorem [ twoletters ] gives that all the words of the form @xmath16 with @xmath17 generate measure free factors of @xmath3 .",
    "these are exactly all the _ three - letter words _ of @xmath3 that are not proper powers . in the special case of @xmath3 , theorem [ bswords ]",
    "says that the words of the form @xmath18 generate measure free factors of @xmath3 .",
    "this produces new examples of groups that are measure equivalent to a free group , for instance the limit groups @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is one of the elements mentioned in theorems [ bswords ] or [ twoletters ] .",
    "we also find measure free factors of some virtually free groups .    * [ vfree ] * let @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 generates a measure free factor of @xmath1 , then @xmath24 generates a measure free factor of @xmath15 for any @xmath25 .",
    "the measure free factors obtained by gaboriau @xcite are the boundary subgroups of certain surface groups ( orientable with positive genus , see [ surface1 ] ) .",
    "theorem [ vfree ] allows us to generalize this to boundary subgroups of some 2-orbifold groups ( with positive genus , see corollary [ orbifold ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : prelim ] covers the preliminary notions and known results .",
    "first we give a brief introduction to borel equivalence relations , treeings and cost , in subsection [ sec : borel ] .",
    "then , in subsection [ sec : mff ] , we recall the definitions and results of gaboriau @xcite that concern measure free factors . we also define _ common measure free factors _",
    "( definition [ commonmff ] ) , which are necessary for proposition [ hnn ] , a version for hnn extensions of gaboriau s theorem about amalgamations ( theorem [ amalgam ] ) . subsection [ sec : ind ] recalls the notions of induced and coinduced actions , and contains the proof of proposition [ hnn ] . section [ sec : lift ] is devoted to the main technical tool , theorem [ lift ] , which gives a way of passing to finite index subgroups in the problem of showing that some cyclic subgroup is a measure free factor .",
    "this result is very related to the kurosh theorem for borel equivalence relations obtained by a. alvarez @xcite , but going in the converse direction .",
    "theorem [ lift ] is then used in section [ sec : surfaces ] to generalize the theorems of gaboriau about the boundary subgroup of surface groups ( [ surface1 ] and [ surface2 ] ) to non - orientable surfaces ( lemma [ surface3 ] ) .",
    "we also prove a version for slightly more general systems of disjoint simple closed curves instead of the boundary subgroup ( proposition [ surface4 ] ) .",
    "finally , section [ sec : mff - new ] contains the proofs of theorems [ bswords ] and [ twoletters ] .",
    "section [ sec : mff - vfree ] gives the proof of theorem [ vfree ] , as well as its corollary [ orbifold ] which generalizes proposition [ surface4 ] to the case of 2-orbifolds .",
    "i would like to thank d. gaboriau for useful discussion and suggestions .",
    "here we review some of the theory of _ borel equivalence relations _ on _ standard borel spaces _ , and the notion of _ cost _ , an invariant of an equivalence relation preserving a probability measure .",
    "this material is covered with detail in the book by kechris and miller @xcite .    a _",
    "standard borel space _ is a measurable space @xmath26 ( a set @xmath26 , together with a @xmath27-algebra of subsets of @xmath26 ) , which is isomorphic as a measurable space to a borel subset of the interval ( with the @xmath27-algebra of borel sets ) .",
    "when @xmath26 is a standard borel space , we will refer to the subsets in its @xmath27-algebra as the borel subsets of @xmath26 .",
    "we will also call an isomorphism of measurable spaces between standard borel spaces a _ borel isomorphism_.    it is a well known result that @xmath26 is a standard borel space if and only if it is isomorphic to a borel subset of any polish space ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "thus products of standard borel spaces are again standard borel spaces .",
    "a _ borel equivalence relation _ on the standard borel space @xmath26 is an equivalence relation @xmath28 which is a borel subset of @xmath29 .",
    "borel equivalence relations are one of the basic objects of this work .",
    "the main example we will consider is when a group @xmath15 acts on @xmath26 by borel automorphisms .",
    "then the equivalence relation @xmath30 , whose classes are the @xmath15-orbits , is borel .",
    "it is a fact that every borel equivalence relation with countable classes comes from the action of some group ( feldman  moore theorem , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 15.1 ) ) , but we will not need to make use of this .",
    "now we turn to _ graphings _ , which play the role of generators for these equivalence relations .",
    "let @xmath26 be a standard borel space .",
    "a _ partially defined isomorphism _ on @xmath26 is a map @xmath31 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are borel subsets of @xmath26 and @xmath32 is a borel isomorphism between them .",
    "if @xmath33 is a family of partial isomorphisms , the equivalence relation _ generated _ by @xmath34 is the minimal borel equivalence relation @xmath28 containing the set @xmath35 we will denote it by @xmath36 .    a _ graphing _ for @xmath37 is a family @xmath38 of partially defined borel isomorphisms on @xmath26 that generates @xmath37    as the name suggests , a graphing defines a graph structure on each equivalence class .",
    "consider the graph with vertex set @xmath26 and edges @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "then its connected components are the equivalence classes of @xmath37 , and this gives the graph structure of each class .    as an example , let @xmath42 be the orbit relation induced by an action @xmath43 . if @xmath44 is a generating set for @xmath15 , then the maps @xmath45 s.t . @xmath46",
