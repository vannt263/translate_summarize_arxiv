    "the virial theorem provides a qualitative argument for a relationship between these three observables ( e.g.  djorgovski & santiago 1993 ) .",
    "although extensive fundamental plane studies have been conducted at low redshifts ( e.g.  bender , burstein & faber 1992 ; guzmn , lucey & bower 1993 ; saglia , bender & dressler 1993 ; pahre et al .",

    "1997 ) , but ongoing efforts will soon make the fundamental plane a primary diagnostic in determining the evolutionary history of early - type galaxies .    fortunately , relatively tight correlations are also found in the _ kormendy relation _ ( kormendy 1977 ) , a projection of the fundamental plane involving the effective radius , @xmath10 , and the mean effective surface brightness within that radius , @xmath5 .",
    "the advantage of the kormendy projection is that it can be explored with large data samples at high redshifts without the need for spectroscopic observations .",
    "the low scatter about the kormendy relation of @xmath5 versus @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is the effective metric radius , allows a reasonably accurate determination of @xmath5 at a standard condition ( sc ) , such as @xmath11kpc .",
    "the dependence of @xmath12 with redshift is determined by the @xmath13 dimming due to the expansion of the universe , the @xmath14-corrections , passive luminosity evolution , and dynamical evolution .",
    "the surface brightness dimming is a firm theoretical prediction , stringently tested by the observed planck distribution of the cosmic background radiation ( mather et al .",
    "the @xmath14-corrections can be accurately deduced from local spectral energy distributions ; consequently , we can infer the luminosity evolution with redshift and compare with predictions from evolutionary synthesis models .",

    "these authors generally find that the luminosity evolution they detect is consistent with or somewhat smaller than expectations based on models of passively evolving old stellar populations .    for evolutionary studies to be truly quantitative , large samples of ellipticals from clusters over a wide range of redshifts are essential , with the high redshift data being particularly important .",
    "in this paper we analyze the luminosity evolution of a population of cluster galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 using a large _ hst _ cluster data set .",
    "although there have been many recent studies of the evolution of the luminosity function for field galaxies ( e.g.  ellis 1997 and references therein ) , very few studies have addressed the issue in higher - density environments .",
    "an important feature of our analysis is the availability of new and comprehensive near - infrared observations over the _ hst _ fields for a large subset of the clusters in our sample .",
    "this has enabled us to construct @xmath8-band luminosity functions for the various cluster galaxy populations .",

    "@xmath8-band observations provide a good estimate of the total stellar mass in old populations .",
    "furthermore , near - ir luminosities are considerably less affected by the occurrence of small , star - forming bursts in galaxies than are the corresponding optical luminosities ( e.g.  barger et al .",
    "consequently , @xmath8-band luminosity functions by morphology give a good indication of the total fraction of old stars in galaxies of different morphological types .",
    "as93 studied the @xmath8-band luminosity functions ( lfs ) of 11 clusters in the @xmath44 range and found no strong evidence for any luminosity evolution .",
    "however , since the area coverage and depth of their images provided only 1020 galaxies per cluster , their uncertainties in the determination of @xmath45 ( the characteristic luminosity ) were of the order of the expected effect for galaxies evolving passively ; thus , no strong conclusions could be drawn .",
    "recently , barger et al .  ( 1996 ) published a detailed study of three @xmath46 clusters .",

    "1996 for details ) after applying only small aperture corrections to our data ( @xmath55mag at @xmath49 to @xmath56mag at @xmath19 ; cf .",
    "as93 ) , we have decided to adopt the mobasher et al.local field lf as the low-@xmath57 comparison sample for our current study .    since not all of the galaxies in our @xmath8-selected samples have redshifts ,",
    "we use published @xmath8 counts by gardner , cowie & wainscoat ( 1994 ) to estimate the field contamination of our cluster data .",
    "these authors found that the field - to - field variations in their number counts were consistent with poisson statistics .",
    "if the same holds true for our data , then the uncertainty introduced by the field subtraction has a very small effect in the determination of @xmath45 in the schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "a @xmath58 variation in the field number counts changes @xmath45 by much less than @xmath58 in the individual cluster luminosity functions .",
    "this uncertainty is reduced even more when several cluster fields are binned together .",
    "we find that the observed lfs for the individual clusters are visually compatible with each other ; thus , we improve the statistics by grouping the clusters into three redshift bins : ac103 , ac114 and ac118 at @xmath59 ; abell  370 , cl0024@xmath2016 and 3c295 at @xmath60 ; and cl0412@xmath3165 , cl1601@xmath2043 , cl0016@xmath2016 and cl0054@xmath3127 at @xmath61 .    since most galaxies , regardless of galaxy spectral type , have a similar spectral energy distribution in the near - ir , the @xmath14-corrections are expected to be independent of morphology ( e.g.  aragn - salamanca 1991 ; aragn - salamanca et al .",

    "note that the magnitude range covered by most of our cluster data ( @xmath68mag ) does not allow us to determine @xmath69 with any confidence . since barger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) obtained @xmath70 using a larger magnitude range for the @xmath71 clusters , we have adopted @xmath72 for this study .",

    "figure  [ morph]a ( top ) shows the combined lf for all the clusters .",
    "the average @xmath74 is in good agreement with the values obtained by as93 in the @xmath75 range and are only slightly brighter than the value found by mobasher et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for field galaxies at @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) . _",
    "thus , over the limited redshift range where the cluster lf can be studied uniformly , we can not detect significant luminosity evolution .",
    "_      in the previous section we combined the early- and late - type populations in order to examine the evolution in the global luminosity function .",
    "however , by combining disparate populations we may dilute the actual evolution that may be occurring for individual classes .",
    "for the early - types we expect mainly passive evolution , modified perhaps by whatever physical process produces the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "for the spirals , whose disks form stars over longer timescales at an approximately constant star formation rate , we expect compensating effects from a passively evolving old stellar population and from a new population of young stars , the details of which depend on the specific star formation history .    since we have morphological information for the cluster galaxies from our _ hst _ imaging ( couch et al .  1998 ; smail et al .",
    "1997a ) , we can examine this point by studying the @xmath8-band lfs by morphological type .",
    "we divide the galaxy samples into early - type ( es and s0s ) and late - type ( spirals and irregulars ) categories .",
    "the galaxy sample is partially reduced because the area imaged by the _",
    "hst _ is slightly smaller than that of the ground - based near - infrared images .",
    "the question arises as to whether the interpretation of an evolutionary signal determined from a combined sample of es and s0s may be confused because of the different evolution for the two sub - classes , particularly given the significant decline in the s0 fraction with increasing redshift seen by dressler et al .",
    "the point is an important one since smail et al .",
    "( 1997a ) note that separating face - on s0s and ellipticals is quite difficult even in _ hst _ images ( many of the early - type galaxies in the smail et al .",
    "catalogs are simply classified as e / s0 or s0/e ) . however , the paucity of s0s in intermediate - redshift clusters ( about 15  per cent , cf.smail et al .",
    "1997a ; dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) , means we do not expect them to have a large effect on the combined lf ( and , in particular , on @xmath45 ) .",
    "nonetheless , we demonstrate the effect quantitatively below .    in this analysis",
    "the field contamination is more uncertain than was the case in  3.1 since reliable @xmath8-band number counts as a function of morphology are not yet available .",
    "instead , we use the _ hst _ medium deep survey counts in the @xmath78-band as a function of morphology ( glazebrook et al .  1995 ) to estimate the counts in @xmath8 for the different types . at the typical depth of our @xmath8-band images ( @xmath79 )",
    "the median redshift is @xmath80 ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) . at this redshift",
    "the average color of early - type galaxies is @xmath81 and that of late - types is @xmath82 ( cf .",
    "as93 ) . using these colors to convert the @xmath78-band number counts as a function of morphology into @xmath8-band number counts as a function of morphology",
    ", we predict that the field contamination is about a factor  2 higher for the spiral and irregular population than it is for the early - type population .",
    "this procedure is not completely satisfactory since the input number counts are @xmath78-band selected instead of @xmath8-band selected and may therefore contain a different mix of galaxy types at a given magnitude than would a @xmath8-band selected sample . moreover , although using average colors at a given magnitude will give the correct normalization of the @xmath8 counts at the typical @xmath8 magnitude , the slope may not be correct . given the narrow range in magnitudes considered here , however , this should be a second - order effect .",
    "nevertheless , we recognize that significant uncertainties could be present in this analysis , but without @xmath8 counts as a function of morphology , all we can do is to try and quantify these uncertainties . as an extreme case ,",
    "let us assume that field contamination affects both the early - types and the late - types _ equally _ such that the field contamination of the e / s0s would be overestimated while that of the spiral / irregulars would be underestimated .",
    "in this scenario we derive @xmath83 values for both the e / s0s and the later types which deviate by slightly less than @xmath58 from the results obtained using our adopted field - subtraction procedure .",
    "thus , the systematic uncertainties introduced by our procedure are likely of the same order of magnitude as the estimated random errors .",
    "we divide the early - type sample into two redshift bins at @xmath84 and @xmath85 . the best - fit schechter function for both bins",
    "is @xmath86 .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty on @xmath45 is quite large due to the small sample size . considering that the expected brightening of the stellar populations from passive evolution in this redshift interval is @xmath87 , our luminosity function analysis is insensitive to such evolution .",
    "this is consistent with the small brightening in the rest - frame @xmath88-band ( @xmath89 ) found by smail et al .",
    "( 1997a ) for the elliptical galaxies in the same redshift range .    in figure",
    "[ morph]a we show cluster lfs sub - divided by morphological type and for the combined samples ( cf .  ",
    "3.1 ) at the mean redshift @xmath90 .",
    "the dominance in the near - ir of the early - type galaxies ( 66 per cent ) over the late - types ( 34 per cent ) in the cluster cores ( @xmath91mpc diameter ) is clearly evident . using the local morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) at an average projected galaxy surface density of @xmath92galaxiesmpc@xmath93 ( corresponding to the one we measure in the _ hst _ images ) we would expect about 18  per cent spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "thus , we find that the fraction of late - types is about a factor  2 higher in our sample than in low redshift clusters .",
    "dressler et al .  (",
    "1997 ) showed that the optical morphological mix in these clusters changes dramatically with redshift . in our data",
    "we see that this change in morphological mix is also evident when the galaxies are selected in the near - ir , where the galaxy selection is done more closely according to their total stellar mass .    in figure",
    "[ morph]b we return to the issue of e and s0 confusion and examine the luminosity distribution of definite s0s in relation to the lf of the combined e+s0s and to the lf with the s0s removed . because the field counts are not available for s0s , it is not possible to correct the distribution for field contamination , but correction would only strengthen the conclusions which follow .",
    "the number of s0s in our sample is too small to shed much light on the strong decline with redshift of the s0 galaxy fraction in rich clusters that dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found .",
    "however , the influence of s0 evolution on the results derived for the es is likely to be quite small , even allowing for some confusion between the two classes .",
    "the derived @xmath45 changes by only @xmath94 ( 0.13 mag ) when we exclude the s0 population . in summary",
    ", the minimal evolution of the e+s0 population faithfully tracks the trend found for the pure elliptical population .",
    "the slow evolution in the @xmath8-band lf of elliptical galaxies in rich clusters contrasts with the recent claim by kauffmann , charlot & white ( 1996 ) that the population of field ellipticals has evolved very rapidly since @xmath95 .",
    "however , it must be remembered that the environments to which these results apply are very different . in the case of the field",
    "elliptical population , the strong evolution is largely in the _ number _ of passively evolving red systems : a result kauffmann et al .",
    "interpret as indicative of the gradual formation of field ellipticals from frequent galaxy mergers as predicted in the hierarchical clustering theory .",
    "the color and luminosity evolution of the oldest examples might well give similar results to the trends located here so the contrast is largely in a _ range of formation ages _ after which passive evolution remains a valid approximation to the luminosity evolution .",
    "in fact , the same hierarchical models ( see kauffmann & charlot 1997 and references therein ) predict a much slower evolution up to @xmath96 for ellipticals in rich clusters since in these very high density environments the associated merging occurs very early , i.e. , well beyond @xmath97 for rich clusters observed at @xmath98 .    finally , we note that fig .",
    "[ morph]a shows that @xmath45 is somewhat brighter for the e and s0 sample than for the late - type galaxies .",
    "this reflects the fact that the brightest cluster galaxies are usually early - type galaxies as is the case in nearby clusters ( e.g.  binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 ) .",
    "the fact that the brightest luminosity bin in the lfs contains @xmath99 spiral galaxies ( with a large error bar ) is probably due to the larger field contamination for the later types .    in this section",
    "we have explored the near - ir lfs of cluster galaxy populations both as a whole and divided into early- and late - type morphologies . due to the current lack of a suitable @xmath100 near - ir cluster lf for use as a comparison template",
    ", we have been unable to draw any strong conclusions concerning the luminosity evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "however , large area near - ir cluster surveys now being carried out ( e.g.  eisenhardt et al .",
    ", in preparation ) will soon permit direct comparisons to be made .",
    "nonetheless , we demonstrate that any evolution consistent with our data must be less than or equal to the expected amount for passive evolution over the redshift range sampled . in the following sections we will concentrate on the cluster _ elliptical _ population .",
    "the presence of the fundamental plane ( hereafter , fp ) for such galaxies permits a more precise measurement of the luminosity evolution in our sample .",
    "as a more sensitive probe of the luminosity evolution of the cluster elliptical galaxy population , we now do a kormendy relation ( kr ) analysis . we select the ellipticals ( t type @xmath315 ) for this study from the visual morphological classification lists presented and described in couch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and smail et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the cluster abell  2390 is the only one not included in either of the above studies ; we classify it as well using the visual scheme .",
    "the classification lists are limited in magnitude to @xmath101 and @xmath102 , as beyond these limits the visual typings become significantly incomplete .",
    "the reliability of the morphological selection of spheroidal galaxies in clusters at @xmath103 was examined in detail by ellis et al .",
    "they found that the visual classifications were robust to @xmath104 but over the interval @xmath105 the distinction between the early - type classes became increasingly uncertain .    in order to reduce contamination of the cluster elliptical samples by foreground / back - ground field ellipticals ,",
    "we have trimmed our samples using all available color information and spectroscopy ( dressler & gunn 1992 ; couch et al .",
    "the color criteria used to isolate the ellipticals which lie on the early - type galaxy locus , and hence to distinguish cluster members , are sufficiently liberal that cluster members will not be removed ( @xmath106mag around the color - magnitude relation in all colors ) . only a few galaxies are removed from the clusters by these cuts .",
    "two previous high - redshift kr studies ( pahre et al .",
    "1996 ; schade et al .",
    "1997 ) adopted a redshift - independent limiting absolute magnitude cut for the cluster galaxy samples .",
    "however , we note that if the luminosities of cluster ellipticals evolve passively in the sense that at higher redshifts the galaxies become brighter , then by adopting a common absolute magnitude limit , the true luminosity evolution of a given sample of cluster ellipticals will necessarily be underestimated .",
    "that is , galaxies which were below a given magnitude cut - off at a lower redshift would brighten as the redshift increased and hence might rise above the fixed cut - off at a higher redshift , thereby contaminating the sample .",
    "a consistent treatment of a passively evolving elliptical population in a kr analysis therefore requires that the evolution of the limiting absolute magnitude _ also _ be taken into account . in principle",
    "this requires an iterative procedure ; in order to impose an absolute magnitude cut the amount of luminosity evolution needs to be known , but this is the quantity we are trying to determine . as discussed in   1 , both the color evolution of the elliptical population and the small scatter observed in their @xmath107 colors imply old ages for the stellar populations ( @xmath15 ) ; thus , for consistency with such results , we assume @xmath15 in our analysis . to predict the luminosity evolution of a passively evolving elliptical galaxy at a given redshift",
    ", we use the 1996 version of the bruzual & charlot ( hereafter , bc96 ) stellar evolutionary models . in practice",
    "we find that an iterative procedure is not really necessary since the overall comparisons of the data with the models do not depend very much on the choice of @xmath108 and our sliding magnitude cut gives closely similar data points for any @xmath108 .",
    "we stress , however , that the optical data points are very dependent on the non - constancy of the absolute magnitude cut , as will be demonstrated subsequently .",
    "we determine the two kr parameters ( the half - light radius , @xmath10 , and the mean surface brightness interior to that radius , @xmath5 ) by fitting the analytic de vaucouleurs law to growth curves constructed from aperture photometry of the morphologically classified ellipticals in the _ hst _ f702w and f814w frames . galaxies for which the growth curves are not well fit by the de vaucouleurs law ( @xmath109  per cent ) , presumably because they have exponential components to their light profiles , are rejected .",
    "we correct all @xmath5 measurements for the observationally established @xmath13 surface brightness dimming by subtracting @xmath110 .    for the clusters for which we have near - infrared imaging , we convert the _ hst _ @xmath5 measurements into @xmath111 using the equations @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the @xmath114 and @xmath115 colors are based on measurements within @xmath116arcsec diameter circular apertures , corrected for mean aperture color effects using @xmath117 ( persson , frogel & aaronson 1979 ) , where @xmath10 has units of arcsec .",
    "we did not first convolve the _ hst _ images to the resolution of the ground - based near - ir imaging ; however , the difference in magnitude between a convolved and an unconvolved image is negligible .",
    "( the difference between an unconvolved image and one convolved to 1arcsec seeing is only 0.01 - 0.02mag , in the sense that the unconvolved magnitude is brighter .",
    "when the image is convolved to 1.5arcsec resolution , the difference is 0.03 - 0.04mag . )",
    "since the fields are relatively crowded , we occasionally are unable to use an object selected in the infrared because it corresponds to several _ hst _ objects .",
    "we correct all @xmath5 values for foreground galactic extinction using e(b - v ) values ( table  [ tab1 ] ) obtained from the burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) maps .",
    "the @xmath14-corrections in @xmath8 are well determined (  [ globallf ] ) , and the uncertainties associated with optical @xmath14-corrections can be minimized by reducing the results to rest - frame @xmath7 because the f814w and f702w passbands closly approximate this band at the higher redshifts sampled .",
    "the latter corrections are determined by folding the _ hst _ filter response functions with the local seds from as93 at the appropriate redshifts .",

    "@xmath129 is the slope parameter of the full fp relation .",
    "we adopt the fp slopes from the local @xmath7-band study of jrgensen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and the local @xmath8-band study of pahre et al .",
    "the slope is found to be @xmath130 in the case of jrgensen et al .  and @xmath131 in the case of pahre et al .",

    "we determine the error on @xmath132 from the equation @xmath133^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 is the number of data points .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the kormendy relation arises from the neglect of the @xmath135 term in the fp relation and dominates the statistical uncertainties in our de vaucouleurs parameter determinations .",
    "it is difficult to ascertain statistical uncertainties when using integrated growth curves , but from direct de vaucouleurs fits to elliptical isophotes , we find the statistical uncertainties in @xmath5 to be an order of magnitude smaller than the intrinsic scatter uncertainties .    for comparison with our high redshift results , we have deduced local cluster data points from the optical data of schade et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and from the near - infrared data of pahre et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , although it should be cautioned that different techniques were used by these observers in determining @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "the values of @xmath136 for the two passbands , defined as @xmath137 are plotted in figs .",
    "[ bsc ] , binned in redshift as in figs .  [ figbkorm ] and [ figkkorm ] , versus @xmath138 .",
    "we use different symbols for each of the data points for clarity .    in figure  [ bsc ]",
    "we plot c - model results from bc96 to compare the data with passive evolution expectations .",
    "the curves assume a salpeter ( 1995 ) initial mass function , solar metallicity , and a 1  gyr initial burst at the redshift of galaxy formation , @xmath108 .",
    "the model predictions involve an additive normalization constant , which we have adjusted to match the central values of the local data points .",
    "we assume for all of our figures a @xmath122 cosmology with @xmath120 km s@xmath121mpc@xmath30 .    figure  [ bsc]a illustrates the effects of applying a constant absolute magntitude cut , @xmath139 , to the optical data .",
    "figure  [ bsc]b shows the corresponding results when a sliding magnitude cut is used ( @xmath139 locally ) .",
    "it is apparent that we would underestimate the amount of luminosity evolution occurring in the elliptical galaxy population if we were to rely on a constant absolute magnitude cut .",
    "although we have shown the bc96 passive evolutionary models for both @xmath140 and @xmath123 in fig .",
    "[ bsc]b , we have only used @xmath123 in applying the absolute magnitude cut to the data . however , we find that the data values are quite insensitive to both the value of @xmath108 assumed and the cosmology .",
    "figure  [ bsc]c shows the @xmath123 and @xmath140 bc96 near - infrared curves plotted on our complete near - infrared data sample . since at present it has only been possible for us to carry out a kr test in the @xmath8-band using surface brightness and scale - length measurements made in the optical , the results should be viewed only as verification of our more accurate @xmath7-band analysis .",
    "@xmath8-band surface brightness analyses will most certainly be improved upon in the near future when ir kr parameters can be measured directly from high resolution _ hst _ nicmos observations .",
    "we see from these figures that both the optical @xmath141 and the infrared @xmath142 data are compatible with the model passive evolution curves .",
    "our @xmath7-band results are in good agreement with those of schade et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , once the sliding absolute magnitude cut has been imposed on their data .",
    "we note that the data point containing the three clusters at @xmath49 appears to be somewhat greater than @xmath143 above the model lines ( each of the three clusters contained in this point were found to be equally discrepant ) .",
    "we do not have an explanation for why this should be the case .",
    "there is compelling evidence from cluster data at moderate redshifts for significant starburst activity , some component of which is likely to be occurring in the elliptical population ( butcher - oemler effect ; dressler & gunn 1992 ; couch & sharples 1987 ; poggianti & barbaro 1996 ; couch et al .",
    "an analysis by barger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) compared observed number distributions of star - forming galaxies in three clusters at @xmath49 with corresponding model expectations .",
    "the models assumed that a population of cluster galaxies had undergone minor secondary bursts of star - forming activity ( creating 1020 per cent of the total stellar mass ) within the past @xmath144gyr .",
    "these authors estimated that @xmath145 per cent of the total cluster population ( including 30 per cent of early - types ) needed to be involved in such activity for the models to adequately reproduce the observations , although this does not necessarily imply that all of the observed bursts are the result of major merging events ( couch et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "since such a high fraction of bursting galaxies might be expected to increase the average luminosity of the elliptical galaxy population , we think it appropriate to consider here how much the _ average _ surface brightness of the elliptical population might increase over the amount predicted by passive evolution models in order to test whether there is a contradiction between our current results ( in which the observed luminosity evolution is seen to be compatible with passive ) and those of previous butcher - oemler studies .",
    "we use the models of barger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to estimate the overall statistical brightening that would result if 30 per cent of a cluster elliptical population at @xmath49 had experienced 10 per cent secondary bursts within the past @xmath146gyr .",
    "for an entirely elliptical galaxy population at @xmath49 , we find that the average brightening is only @xmath147mag arcsec@xmath93 in @xmath7 and @xmath148mag arcsec@xmath93 in @xmath8 .",
    "since this amount is relatively insignificant at this redshift , we conclude that the brightening due to minor starbursts in some proportion of the elliptical population would not cause an appreciable shift in the passive evolution curves and that our kormendy relation results are unlikely to be affected significantly by starburst phenomena .",
    "we analyzed _ hst _ data for 13 rich clusters over the redshift range @xmath18 to @xmath19 and extended the database by securing new near - infrared images over the same fields for a substantial subset .",
    "taking advantage of the benefits of near - infrared selection for studies of galaxy evolution over a range in redshift , we determined the total ir lfs for our clusters , as well as the lfs by morphological type . restricting the sample to _ bona fide _",
    "cluster ellipticals , we then analyzed the evolution with redshift of the kormendy relation of mean effective surface brightness , @xmath5 , versus effective metric radius , @xmath4 , in both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands .",
    "our principal results are as follows :    @xmath149 the total cluster and pure elliptical lfs do not show any evidence for luminosity evolution over the redshift range sampled .",
    "this result is consistent with passive evolution in the elliptical population , although quantitative estimates are limited by the absence of a reliable local cluster elliptical lf .",
    "we demonstrate that our result is not affected by possible contamination of the pure elliptical sample from misclassified s0s following a different evolutionary history .",
    "@xmath149 the lfs as a function of morphology further indicate that the galaxy population is dominated by early - types ( 64 percent ) and that the fraction of spirals and irregulars is about a factor of two larger than the fraction observed in similar dense environments at low @xmath57 .",
    "the data also suggest that the characteristic luminosity of the early - type galaxies is brighter by @xmath150mag than the characteristic luminosity of the later types .",
    "@xmath149 the surface brightness @xmath151 values for the high redshift cluster samples at the standard condition of mean effective radius @xmath17kpc are in accord with passive evolution expectations of the bc96 code in both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands .",
