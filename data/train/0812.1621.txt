    "however , it is important to remark that stability of this model requires the addition of scalar field potentials on the planck and tev branes . as mentioned in @xcite , after introducing stabilizing potentials a large value of @xmath0 is needed in order to avoid a new hierarchy for the scalar field .    in the brans - dicke theory",
    "the presence of a background scalar field was crucial .",
    "a possible future investigation would be studying the effect of other background fields like the kalb - ramond field which is motivated by string theory ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
