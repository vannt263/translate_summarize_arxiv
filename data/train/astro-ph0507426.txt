    "is a space telescope mission concept aimed at measuring the time variation in the equation of state of the dark energy responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "initially focused on the use of type  ia supernovae as a means of measuring the expansion history of the universe through the luminosity - distance relation .",
    "however , the instrument suite proved to be quite generic , allowing , for example , the inclusion of gravitational weak lensing as another means of constraining the properties of dark energy .",
    "indeed , s very powerful wide - field imager and the interest in using it for complementary science has in many ways motivated and shaped this `` wide - field imaging from space '' conference .",
    "before looking at the exciting discoveries that holds for the future , it is worthwhile to consider recent past and on - going work to constrain the nature of dark energy . in the six years since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe a wealth of new observations have confirmed and further refined the initial discovery . in concert with newer data from type  ia supernovae ( including constraints on flatness from the cmb and on  from large - scale structure and clusters ) , the statistical significance of the acceleration is now @xmath4 .",
    "just as importantly , the equation of state of the dark energy is now constrained to be @xmath5 ( assuming the equation of state is constant ) .",
    "space - based observations have played an increasing role in cosmological measurements of type  ia supernovae .",
    "this is simply due to the much smaller sky noise present in a point - source photometry aperture in space compared with the ground  especially at redder optical wavelengths .",
    "the discovery papers @xcite contained just four supernovae measured with . samples totaling 39 type  ia supernovae , segregated into early , middle and late host - galaxy morphologies from an snapshot survey , were shown to support an accelerating expansion @xcite .",
    "precise corrections for dust extinction of eleven more supernovae made possible by accurate photometry were shown to support the accelerating expansion and provided tighter constraints on the dark energy equation of state @xcite .",
    "a sample of high - redshift supernovae reaching @xmath6 has shown that the supernovae follow the transition from deceleration to acceleration expected as the universe goes from matter domination to dark energy domination @xcite .",
    "these space - based measurements have significantly bolstered both the case for dark energy and the efficacy of type  ia supernovae as distance indicators .",
    "accordingly , today the most precise and highest - redshift supernova measurements  several dozen so far  are most often obtained with .",
    "an example of the state of the art in space - based supernova cosmology is a joint endeavor involving the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) and the higher-@xmath7 supernova search team ( hzsst ) which around the time of this conference was conducting a search spanning four epochs , each covering fifteen pointings covering the northern goods field .",
    "the searches are separated by 45 days  roughly equal to the time from explosion to maximum light in the restframe of @xmath8 type  ia supernovae .",
    "the search uses the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) with the 850  nm long - pass filter in order to reach redward of the restframe uv cut - off exhibited by type  ia supernovae . a short exposure in the f775w filter",
    "is added in order to reject some fraction of type  ii supernovae , which in the first 10 days have much more uv flux than type  ia supernovae .",
    "the depth of the goods field at optical ( ) and infrared ( ground - based ) wavelengths means that photometric redshifts are known for many supernova host galaxies .",
    "in addition , the galaxy colors at the location of the supernovae provide a handle on whether or not star - formation is likely to be ongoing , which can help eliminate likely core - collapse supernovae .",
    "all of this advance information is used to help select one or two likely type  ia supernovae suitable for follow - up .",
    "each team has three target - of - opportunity triggers and 60 orbits for near - infrared follow - up observations with nicmos and slitless spectroscopy with acs . for these searches each supernova lightcurve and its associated search costs roughly 30 orbits .",
    "at the time of this conference the scp had netted a probable @xmath9 type  ia supernova from the first of the four search epochs .",
    "the discovery image is show in figure  2 .",
    "since then , several more supernova have been found as part of this program .",
    "unfortunately , all of these supernovae have just the bare minimum of data needed to place them on the hubble diagram , leaving little extra information for testing for systematic effects in the measurement . a satellite such as will increase the number of such supernovae by orders of magnitude , but will also have much higher data quality and systematics controls .",
    "while type  ia supernovae have shown tremendous value in revealing the presence of dark energy and exploring its nature , we should be concerned that this purely empirical technique will reach a systematics floor .",
    "the single - parameter light - curve width correction method ( plus extinction correction ) reduces the scatter in type  ia supernovae at peak to somewhere in the range 0.100.15 mag @xcite .",
    "however , there is nothing special about the physical conditions in a supernova when it appears its brightest . indeed a newly developed technique , cmagic , standardizes type  ia supernovae using the color and magnitude roughly 15 days after maximum , when the supernova reaches a color of @xmath10-@xmath11=0.6 @xcite .",
    "this method has been shown to reduce the scatter to below 0.10  mag .",
    "thus , it is possible that type  ia supernovae are more homogeneous at a given color rather than at a given lightcurve epoch .",
    "many more observations of nearby supernovae , focusing on accurate colors with well - determined uncertainties will be a great boon in improving the standardization of type  ia supernovae . by lowering the remaining scatter ,",
    "stronger limits are also set on any possible remaining systematics in the type  ia methodology .",
    "the objective of the mission is to provide the best possible constraint on the time - evolution of the dark energy equation of state .",
    "the only demonstrated experimental techniques are astronomical , and of these , the luminosity distance from type  ia supernovae is by far the most mature .",
    "therefore , it was natural to design a mission focused on supernovae , but as we shall see , the resulting design is sufficiently general to perform exceptionally well for gravitational weak lensing .",
    "pushing the type  ia supernova method to its limit requires thousands of supernovae spanning a wide range in redshift .",
    "the present design targets 2000 normal type  ia supernovae from redshift 0.1 to 1.7 .",
    "it is extremely critical that the photometry be of high quality continuously from low to high redshift , not only to realize the statistical power of the sample but to avoid introduction of systematics errors @xcite . due to the increasing brightness of the terrestrial night sky at redder wavelengths where",
    "higher redshift type  ia supernovae must be observed , coupled with increasing atmospheric water absorption at redder wavelengths , the necessary data quality can be obtained only from space .",
    "the broad redshift coverage needed to control systematics further requires detectors at both optical and infrared wavelengths .",
    "telescope optical design and spacecraft size and mass constraints point to a dedicated 2-m telescope with a field of view several hundred times larger than that possessed by , populated with visible and near - infrared detectors .",
    "further , in order to determine the supernova type , and possible sub - class , a sensitive low - resolution spectrograph is required .",
    "systematics control enabled by spectrophotometric spectra , as well as allowance for spacecraft pointing margin , call for an integral field unit spectrograph .",
    "gravitational weak lensing measurements have become increasingly robust over the past decade .",
    "long viewed as a means of constraining , more detailed theoretical studies  several developed within the collaboration  indicate that precision weak lensing measurements have the capability to place constraints on the dark energy equation of state similar to those possible with type  ia supernovae .",
    "in particular , weak lensing cross - correlation cosmography  measuring the association between foreground template mass distributions and background weak lensing shear using galaxies located using photometric redshifts  appears to be the most powerful weak lensing approach @xcite .",
    "atmospheric turbulence results in poor spatial resolution for high - redshift galaxies observed from the ground .",
    "furthermore , ground - based telescope and camera optics are far from being diffraction - limited .",
    "so great care must be taken in removing the effects of seeing , tracking errors , and optical aberrations .",
    "stars provide the reference for removing these effects , but the number of usable stars is limited , due to both the limited size of the isoplanatic patch within which seeing is correlated and difficulty in distinguishing the few stars from the large number of galaxies at faint magnitudes . errors in these corrections set a limit on the quality that ground - based weak lensing will be able to achieve .    in comparison ,",
    "space - based wide - field observations resolve many more sources and the remaining corrections for tracking and telescope aberrations are much smaller relative to the sizes of the sources .",
    "figure  4 illustrates the dramatic gain in the number of resolved galaxies in going from ground- to space - based observations .",
    "moreover , in contrast to , will be placed in a stable thermal environment so that any corrections can be determined using many spatially uncorrelated images . moreover",
    ", the deep optical and infrared photometry from will provide high - quality photometric redshifts as needed to implement the cross - correlation cosmography method .",
    "therefore , can provide excellent weak lensing data for constraining changes in the dark energy equation of state @xcite .",
    "in detail , the telescope design is a three - mirror anastigmat with a 2-m primary mirror @xcite .",
    "the optics are silver - coated to maximize the optical and near - infrared throughput and minimize the thermal emissivity .",
    "the imager consists of 0.34 sq .",
    "degrees paved with red - sensitive ccd s and a scale of 0.10  /pixel , and 0.34 sq .",
    "degrees paved with hgcdte near - infrared detectors with a scale of 0.18  /pixel @xcite .",
    "the sizes of the detectors are identical and those made of hgcdte have a long - wavelength cutoff which reduces the dark current ( and sensitivity to thermal emission ) .",
    "these features allow the ccd and hgcdte detectors to be mounted in the same focal plane , simplifying the imager construction , mounting , and alignment .",
    "each detector has its own filter , so a large filter wheel which would otherwise be needed is avoided .",
    "detailed simulations show that photometry of sufficient quality and redshift range is not possible from the ground even under optimistic assumptions .",
    "the spectrograph has a prism as its dispersing element , providing resolution @xmath12 across optical and near - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "higher resolution is unnecessary due to the velocity broadening intrinsic to the spectra of type  ia supernovae .",
    "again , the optical detector is a red - sensitive ccd while the near - infrared detector is hgcdte with a long - wavelength cut - off near 1.7  @xmath13 m .",
    "the spectrograph is fed by an image slicer integral field unit .",
    "the field is 6@xmath143 , wth the latter dimension being divided into 40 slices .",
    "detailed simulations show quite dramatically that spectroscopy of comparable quality is not possible from the ground , even with a thirty meter telescope with adaptive optics .",
    ".nominal parameters of the surveys [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the nature of dark energy is a fundamental question , which astronomical observations can address .",
    "type  ia supernova and weak lensing are the most powerful techniques yet developed for studying dark energy .",
    "reaching the requisite statistical and systematics accuracy with these techniques requires a widefield imager in space",
    ". represents a very advanced concept for such a widefield imager , having an instrument suite which is both powerful and versatile .",
    "table  1 details this power for the type  i supernova survey , a nominal wide - field weak lensing survey , and a possible panoramic weak lensing survey . the planned dark energy program for the joint dark energy mission ( ) will produce a treasure trove of data for archival study .",
    "guest observer programs that could further exploit such a powerful instrument are envisioned in the concept .",
    "the following conference presentations describe many of the scientific lines of inquiry which would be greatly advanced with a facility such as ."
