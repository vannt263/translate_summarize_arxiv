    "wikipedia is `` a free , web - based , collaborative , multilingual encyclopaedia project '' supported by the non - profit wikimedia foundation ( wmf )",
    ". started in 2001 , wikipedia has become the largest and most popular general reference knowledge source on the internet .",
    "almost all of its 19.7 million articles can be edited by anyone with access to the site , and it has about 90,000 regularly active volunteer editors around the world .",
    "however , it has recently been observed that wikipedia growth has slowed down significantly @xcite . in particular",
    ", wmf has reported that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ between 2005 and 2007 , newbies started having real trouble successfully joining the wikimedia community . before 2005 in the english wikipedia , nearly 40% of new editors would still be active a year after their first edit .",
    "after 2007 , only about 12 - 15% of new editors were still active a year after their first edit .",
    "post-2007 , lots of people were still trying to become wikipedia editors .",
    "what had changed , though , is that they were increasingly failing to integrate into the wikipedia community , and failing increasingly quickly .",
    "the wikimedia community had become too hard to penetrate . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it is therefore of utter importance to understand quantitatively what factors determine editors future editing behaviour ( why they continue editing , change the pace of editing , or stop editing ) , in order to ensure that the wikipedia community can continue to grow in terms of size and diversity .",
    "the wikipedia participation challenge , sponsored by wmf and hosted by kaggle , request contestants to build a predictive model that could accurately predict the number of edits a wikipedia editor would make in the next 5 months based on his edit history so far .",
    "such a predictive model may be able to help wmf in figuring out how people can be encouraged to become , and remain , active contributors to wikipedia .",
    "the ` training ' dataset consists of randomly sampled active editors with their full history of editing activities on the english wikipedia ( the first 6 namespaces only ) in the period from 2001 - 01 - 01 to 2010 - 09 - 01 .",
    "an editor is considered `` active '' if he or she made at least one edit in the last one year period , i.e. , from 2009 - 09 - 01 to 2010 - 09 - 01 . for each edit ,",
    "the available information includes its user_id , article_id , revision_id , namespace , timestamp , etc .    the predictive model to be constructed should predict , for each editor from the ` training ' dataset , how many edits would be made in the 5 months after the end date of the ` training ' dataset , i.e. , from 2010 - 09 - 01 to 2011 - 02 - 01 .",
    "the predictive model s accuracy is going to be measured by the root mean squared logarithmic error ( rmsle ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is total number of editors in the dataset , @xmath2 is the natural logarithm function , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the predicted and actual edit numbers respectively for editor @xmath5 in the next 5 month period .    the best submission from our team , `` zeditor '' , achieved 41.7% improvement over wmf s baseline predictive model and the final rank of 3rd place among 96 teams . an interesting characteristic of our approach is that only temporal dynamics features ( i.e. , how the number of edits changes in recent periods , etc . )",
    "are used in a self - supervised learning framework , which makes it easy to be generalised to other application domains .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : approach ] , we present our approach in details . in section [ sec : experiments ] , we show the experimental results . in section [ sec : relatedwork ] , we review the related work . in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we make conclusions .",
    "our basic idea is to build a predictive model @xmath6 ( that estimates an active editor s future number of edits based on his recent edit history ) through self - supervised learning , as illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : framework ] .",
    "the approach is called `` self - supervised '' to emphasise the fact that it does not require any manual labelling of data ( as in standard _ supervised learning _",
    "@xcite ) but extracts the needed labels from data automatically .        to facilitate the description of our approach , we shall from now on talk about any time - length in the unit of months and refer to any time - point as the real number of months passed since the beginning date of the dataset .",
    "so for the official dataset ` training ' , the timestamp `` 2001 - 06 - 16 00:00:00 '' would be 5.5 because it is five and a half months since 2001 - 01 - 01 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the time - point when we would like to predict each active editor s number of edits in the next 5 months . to train the predictive model , we would move 5 months backwards and assume that we were at the time - point @xmath8 .",
    "thus we could know the actual number of edits made by each active editor in those 5 months after @xmath9 , i.e. , the label for our machine learning ( regression ) methods .",
    "specifically , the target value for regression would be set as @xmath10 where @xmath4 is the actual number of edits in the next 5 months . in this way ,",
    "the _ squared error _ loss function @xmath11 used by most machine learning methods ( including those in our experiments and final submission ) would connect the _ empirical risk _",
    "@xcite directly to the evaluation metric rmsle : @xmath12    given a time - point ( either @xmath9 or @xmath7 ) , each active editor @xmath5 would be represented as a vector @xmath13 that consists of the following temporal dynamics features :    * the number of edits in recent periods of time ; * the number of edited articles in recent periods of time ; * the length of time between the first edit and the last edit , scaled logarithmically .",
    "the periods used in our final submission for the above temporal dynamics features are @xmath14 where the length of period first doubles at each step from @xmath15 to 4 and then triples at each step from 4 to 108 .",
    "the usage of such temporal dynamics features was inspired by the decent performance of the `` most - recent-5-months - benchmark ''  if using the exact number of edits in just one period ( the last 5 months ) for prediction could work reasonably well , we should be able to achieve a better performance by using many more recent periods .",
    "the periods were chosen to be at exponentially increasing temporal scales , because we conjecture that the influence of an editing activity to the editor s future editing behaviour would be exponentially decaying along with the time distance away from now .",
    "the process of _ _ exponential decay _ _ occurs in numerous natural phenomena , and it has been widely used in temporal applications where it is desirable to gradually discount the history of past events @xcite .",
    "one reason for changing from doubling to tripling midway through is to include the special period of 12-months ( i.e. , one year ) that has been used to define the `` active '' editors .",
    "the periods will be capped by the time scope of the given dataset ( e.g. , 106 for the additional dataset ` moredata ' ) in case they are out of range .",
    "we have also introduced a constant _ drift _ term ( i.e. , how much the average number of edits would change after 5 months ) into the formula of making final predictions , which is a crude way to cover the global shift of target values along with time .",
    "again , its value is estimated from the situation 5 months ago .",
    "the concise pseudo - code of our algorithms for learning and predicting is shown in figure  [ fig : algorithm ] .",
    "the complete source code will be made available at the author s homepage .    ' '' ''    learning    * @xmath16 ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) * for each active editor @xmath5 who made at least one edit in @xmath18 : * * represent the editor as a vector @xmath13 consisting of temporal dynamics features ( please refer to the above description ) * * label the editor by @xmath10 where @xmath4 is the actual number of edits in @xmath19 * learn a predictive model / function @xmath20 from @xmath21 pairs using a regression technique such as gbt * estimate the drift @xmath22 by comparing the average number of edits in @xmath23 and that in @xmath19    ' '' ''    predicting    * @xmath24 ( e.g. , @xmath25 for the dataset ` training ' ) * for each active editor @xmath5 who made at least one edit in @xmath18 : * * represent the editor as a vector @xmath13 consisting of temporal dynamics features ( please refer to the above description ) * * compute @xmath26 = @xmath27 using the learnt @xmath6 * * output @xmath28 as the predicted number of edits in @xmath19    ' '' ''",
    "there are three datasets available to all contestants :    * ` training ' is the official dataset for training and testing ; * ` validation ' is the official dataset for validation ; * ` moredata ' is the additional dataset generously provided by twan van laarhoven .",
    "the characteristics of each dataset are shown in table  [ tab : dataset ] .",
    ".the characteristics of each dataset . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      since ` moredata ' is more similar than ` validation ' to the official dataset ` training ' in terms of the time scope and the number of editors , we applied the best working algorithm , gbt , with the optimal parameter setting on ` moredata ' ( _ weak_count _ = 1000 ) , to make the final submission based on ` training ' .",
    "it got an rmsle score of 0.862582 on the private leaderboard , which is roughly 41.7% better than wmf s baseline predictive model .",
    "the final rank of our team , `` zeditor '' , is the 3rd place among 96 teams .",
    "the global slowdown of wikipedia s growth rate ( both in the number of editors and the number of edits per month ) has been studied @xcite .",
    "it is found that medium - frequency editors now cover a lower percentage of the total population while high frequency editors continue to increase the number of their edits .",
    "moreover , there are increased patterns of conflict and dominance ( e.g. , greater resistance to new edits in particular those from occasional editors ) , which may be the consequence of the increasingly limited opportunities in making novel contributions .",
    "these findings could guide us to generate other kinds of useful features to tackle the problem of edit number prediction .",
    "furthermore , researchers have also investigated other activities of wikipedia s editors , such as voting on the promotion of wikipedia admins @xcite .",
    "in addition to wikipedia , the temporal dynamics of online users behaviour has been explored and exploited in web search @xcite , social tagging @xcite , blogging @xcite , twittering @xcite , and collaborative filtering @xcite . the _ power law _ @xcite and the _ exponential decay _",
    "@xcite seem to be recurrent themes across application domains .",
    "our most important insight is that a wikipedia editor s future behaviour can be largely determined by the temporal dynamics of his recent behaviour .",
    "we are a bit surprised that just temporal dynamics features can go such a long way when we choose proper temporal scales and employ a powerful machine learning method .",
    "human beings seem to be working and living in a more mechanical way than one might have thought .",
    "since such temporal dynamics features are actually independent of any semantics or knowledge about this specific problem , our approach could be easily generalised to other application domains , such as predicting the future supermarket spendings of shoppers ( e.g. , the dunnhumby s shopper challenge ) , predicting the future hospital admissions of patients ( e.g. , the heritage health prize competition ) , and so on , based on historical behavioural data .",
    "have we answered the question that we asked at the beginning of this paper ?",
    "yes and no .",
    "on one hand , we have built a predictive model which can be used to identify those editors who are likely to become inactive , or in other words , who need special care and attention to be kept  if an editor is going to leave the wikipedia community , there would probably be early signals in the temporal dynamics of his recent behaviour .",
    "on the other hand , that predictive model is pretty much a black box  it does not reveal the underlying reasons why editors become inactive , and therefore it can not tell us how to encourage editors to remain active . for the ultimate purpose of wikipedia s sustainable growth , we will need to investigate which attributes of an editor ( his articles category distribution , his relationship with other editors , etc . ) and also which recent events happened to him ( his articles being deleted , his revisions being reverted , unfair comments about his edits being received , etc . ) could affect his behaviour .",
    "due to the time constraints and the dataset limitations ( for example , the lack of information about articles and comments in the datasets ` validation ' and ` moredata ' ) , we have to leave it to future work .    long live wikipedia !",
    "we would like to thank wmf and kaggle for their wonderful job in organising this interesting contest .",
    "we are grateful to twan van laarhoven for creating and sharing the additional dataset ` moredata ' .",
