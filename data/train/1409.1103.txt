    "the hubbard model provides a fundamental description of correlation effects in many - body condensed matter systems . on the square lattice bilayer , it exhibits several different routes for the transition out of normal metallic behavior by an independent tunability of ( i ) the free band - structure via a single tight - binding parameter , i.e. , the interlayer hopping amplitude , ( ii ) the onsite repulsion , as well as ( iii ) the filling .",
    "for example , at half filling , the interlayer hopping controls a continuous transition from a mott - insulating state to a band insulator  @xcite .",

    "e.g. ref .  , as well as in the context of copper oxide bilayers featuring high-@xmath2 superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the bilayer hubbard model might as well become a rich and instructive example system with a well - defined and at the same time complex phase diagram , given the progress in the controlled manipulation of ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the bilayer hubbard model at half filling has been studied independently using various methods recently , ranging from dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) and cluster extensions@xcite and variational monte carlo@xcite , to finite - temperature determinantal quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) studies@xcite . at present , however , it appears that some of the results on its phase diagram remain inconclusive  especially since the persistence of an extended paramagnetic metallic phase at small onsite interactions has been put forward based on cluster dmft@xcite as well as finite temperature dqmc calculations@xcite  a result , which contrasts the perfect nesting property of the noninteracting system at half filling throughout the whole metallic regime .",
    "the above outlined perspectives for the physics of the bilayer hubbard model hence call for a clarification concerning its ground state phase diagram at half filling .    here",
    ", we provide a comprehensive account on the ground state phase diagram by combining complementary methods , which  taken together  allow us to cover the full range of the local interaction strength . for this purpose ,",
    "we first review the standard hartree - fock mean - field theory ( hfmft ) approximation to properly settle the mean - field character of the antiferromagnetic state as a function of the onsite interaction , as arising from a stoner instability of the metallic noninteracting state . in a second step , which leads systematically beyond mean - field theory as well as random phase approximations ( rpa )",
    ", we implement a functional renormalization group ( frg ) method in the discrete patching scheme , which provides a well - controlled approach at weak interactions and allows us to obtain reliable results for intermediate interaction strengths  @xcite . an important benefit provided by this method",
    "is that it takes into account effects from possibly competing correlations and therefore allows us to detect the appearance of instabilities in an unbiased way , i.e. without a priori assumptions concerning the nature of the emerging order .",
    "finally , we employ an unbiased and numerically exact method , zero - temperature ( projective ) dqmc , which is particularly powerful in the regime of intermediate to strong coupling and which allows us to identify actual ground state correlations on finite systems .",

    "we first employ an frg approach that shows in an unbiased way how the antiferromagnetic instability indeed emerges in the weak - interaction regime from the noninteracting metallic state .      here",

    "a divergence in the interaction vertex is a dependable indicator for a tendency towards the formation of an ordered state and the well - pronounced emerging momentum structure close to the critical scale allows us to identify an effective hamiltonian for the low - energy regime . in practice",
