    "hot molecular cores ( hmcs ) , first discovered in the vicinity of massive protostars ( see kurtz et al.2000 for a review ) , are compact ( @xmath3  pc , @xmath4  @xmath5 ) objects with relatively high temperatures ( @xmath6  k ) that show a very rich chemistry in complex organic molecules ( ch@xmath2cn , ch@xmath2oh , ch@xmath2ocho ,  ) .",

    "these so - called hot corinos share many characteristics with hmcs , although the former are @xmath7 times less massive .",
    "many questions remain unanswered regarding both the high - mass and low - mass hot core phase .",
    "for example , hmcs are relatively large objects ( @xmath8 0.1 pc ) and harbor clusters of stars , while hot corinos seem to be smaller molecular envelopes surrounding a single low - mass young stellar object ( yso ) or binary . additionally ,",
    "although hmcs are generally understood to be illuminated by the newly born high - mass stars embedded within the cores themselves ( cesaroni 2005 ) , an alternative scenario has been proposed for hot corinos , in which jets and shocks are responsible for enhancing the temperature and the abundances of many species ( chandler et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "intermediate - mass ysos ( imysos ; @xmath98  @xmath1 ) are excellent targets to study the different hot core heating mechanisms ( radiative or shocks ) , because they share some properties of massive stars , such as their association with clusters and their ability to photodissociate and ionize the surrounding gas , and present the advantages of being located closer ( @xmath10  kpc ) than most of the massive star - forming regions , and in regions of less complexity . however , there are only two imysos with hot core emission reported in the literature , ngc7129-firs  2 and ic  1396  n ( fuente et al .  2005 , 2009 ) , and",

    "the presence of a strong and compact submillimeter dust condensation ( jenness et al .",

    "the millimeter continuum emission is likely tracing the dust envelope of i22198 .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) reported by snchez - monge et al .",

    "maps reveal an outflow with a quadrupolar morphology clearly centered on the position of the dust condensation .",
    "the outflow emission spans a velocity range from @xmath52  km  s@xmath17  to @xmath53  km  s@xmath17  for the @xmath54 transition ( the systemic velocity is @xmath55  km  s@xmath17 ) .",
    "the quadrupolar morphology of the outflow can be interpreted as the walls of a single outflow or as the superposition of two bipolar outflows : outflow a in the southwest - northeast direction , and outflow b in the northwest - southeast direction .",
    "both outflows are centered on the position of the millimeter continuum source , which could be a millimeter clump harbouring at least two sources .",
    "in fact , higher angular resolution observations ( 0.4  or 300 au ) with the pdbi at 1.3  mm reveal a strong source with indications of a faint extension to the south ( palau et al . , in prep . ) . in the following",
    ", we will assume the two outflow interpretation .",
    "we estimated the physical parameters of outflows a and b ( see table  [ timhcs ] ) and found values similar to the outflow parameters found in other imysos ( e.g.,ic  1396  n : beltrn et al .",

    "the integrated sio(21 ) emission , spanning a velocity range from @xmath52 to @xmath56  km  s@xmath17 , is shown in white contours in fig .",
    "[ firegion ] .",
    "this emission coincides with the blueshifted lobe of outflow a. no redshifted counterpart is observed for the sio emission , however .",
    "the detection of sio in outflow a suggests that it is younger than outflow b , because gas - phase sio abundances may decrease with time ( klaassen & wilson 2007 ; shang et al .",
    "the sio detection also suggests that the co quadrupolar morphology arises from two distinct outflows , because sio generally traces material associated with the primary jet driving the outflow rather than the walls of the outflow cavity ( e.g. ,  h211 : palau et al .",
    "2006 ; lee et al .",
    "we also note that the irac 4.5  @xmath42 m  band ( grey scale in fig .",
    "[ firegion ]  left ) shows extended emission ( `` green fuzzy '' ) associated mainly with the blueshifted co outflow lobes .",
    "such 4.5  @xmath42 m  extended emission is thought to be associated with shocked h@xmath12 emission ( de buizer & vacca 2010 ) .",
    "c +    the wide - band sma spectrum toward i22198 ( fig .",
    "[ fispec ] ) reveals a chemically rich dense core with typical hot core features ( e.g. ,  cesaroni et al.1999 ; gibb et al .",
    "molecular line transitions detected with @xmath57  k have been identified and imaged .",
    "we note that the linewidths observed for most of the molecules are 58  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ firegion ] ( right panel ) shows the maps of high - density tracers with a compact source ( @xmath58 , with @xmath59 ) at the position of the millimeter continuum source .",
    "although the maps of each molecule show a source barely resolved , and higher angular resolutions should be made , first - order moment ( velocity field ) maps for these high - density tracers ( fig .",
    "[ firegion ]  right ) show velocity gradients in the northwest - southeast direction , perpendicular to outflow a , presumable the youngest outflow .",
    "most of these molecules trace disks and/or toroids in other massive ysos ( e.g. ,  beltrn et al .",
    "however , the presence of outflow b perpendicular to outflow a makes the interpretation of these velocity gradients uncertain . assuming that these gradients trace rotation , the dynamical mass has been calculated from the expression @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the velocity estimated from the gradient , @xmath62 the radius of the core , @xmath63 the gravitational constant , and @xmath64 the inclination angle assumed to be 90  ( edge - on ) . in our case , with @xmath65  km  s@xmath17  and @xmath66  for the four molecules shown in fig .",
    "[ firegion ]  right , the dynamical mass is @xmath67  @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , following the models of palla & stahler ( 1993 ) , and assuming a luminosity for the object of @xmath68  @xmath11  ( fig .",
    "[ fised ] ) , the mass of the embedded yso is about 45  @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the mass of the internal yso estimated from both methods is @xmath69  @xmath1 , which is similar to the dust envelope mass ( @xmath0  @xmath1 ) , as is characterisc of class  0 objects .",
    "because of the wide sma band , one can observe several ch@xmath2cn and ch@xmath2oh transitions simultaneously .",
    "following the rotational diagram method ( goldsmith & langer 1999 ; araya et al .",
    "2005 ) , which assumes that all molecular levels are populated according to the same excitation temperature , we can derive this temperature , @xmath70 , and the total column density , @xmath71 , for these molecules .",
    "we constructed the rotational diagrams following two methods .",
    "first , we assumed optically thin emission ( open symbols in fig .",
    "[ firotdia ] ) .",
    "second , we estimated the opacity for each transition ( following goicoechea et al .  2006 ; see also girart et al .  2002 ) and we adopted the value that yielded the best linear fit ( filled symbols in fig .  [ firotdia ] ) .",
    "the resulting opacities for the different ch@xmath2cn and ch@xmath2oh transitions range from 0.3 to 3.5 and from 0.2 to 6.5 , respectively . in the discussion we will use the results of the latter fit , which are @xmath72  k and @xmath73  @xmath74 for ch@xmath2cn , and @xmath75  k and @xmath76  @xmath74 for ch@xmath2oh .",
    "the high temperatures , together with the chemically rich spectrum , are clear evidence that i22198 is an intermediate - mass hot core .",
    "our interferometric continuum and molecular line observations toward i22198 reveal a compact and strong millimeter source driving a quadrupolar outflow , which is associated with a compact dense core with hot core signatures . at infrared wavelengths ,",
    "irac images reveal a single source coincident with the hot core and with `` green fuzzies '' at 4.5  @xmath42 m . the high rotational temperature ( 100150  k ) estimated from the ch@xmath2cn and ch@xmath2oh rotational diagrams , and the chemically rich spectrum , make i22198 one of the few imhcs known at present .",
    "there are only two other imhcs reported in the literature : ngc7129-firs  2 ( fuente et al .",
    "2005 ) , and ic  1396  n ( neri et al .  2007 ;",
    "fuente et al .",
    "table  [ timhcs ] lists the main properties of the three imhcs known to date .    ic  1396  n is associated with a single iras source , iras  21319 + 5802 .",
    "however , high - angular resolution millimeter images reveal a cluster of sources , only one of which is associated with the imhc ( neri et al .  2007 ) .",
    "moreover , while spitzer / irac observations reveal a counterpart for millimeter source 41.73 + 12.8 , there is no counterpart for the imhc millimeter source ( 41.86 + 11.9 ; choudhury et al .  2010 ; neri et al .",
