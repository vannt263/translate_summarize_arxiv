    "@xcite ) , very small but non - vanishing cosmological constant or dark energy ( weinberg @xcite ) , ( carroll @xcite ; padmanabhan ( @xcite , @xcite ) ) , and theoretically extraordinarily huge quantum vacuum energy density ( zeldovich @xcite ) , ( volovik ( @xcite , @xcite ) ) can be treated as mutually related or as independent problems .",
    "an old approach to the issue of the cosmological constant @xmath0 utilizes quantum vacuum energy as a solution of this issue , but unfortunately it does not work properly .",
    "namely , it appears that directly calculated , casimir - like value of quantum vacuum energy is more than one hundred orders greater than expected .",
    "such a huge value of quantum vacuum energy is a serious theoretical problem in itself .",
    "lowering the uv cutoff scale down from the planckian to the supersymmetric one is a symbolic improvement ( roughly , it cuts the order by two ( weinberg @xcite ) ) .",
    "a more radical reduction of the cutoff could cure the situation but it would create new problems . sometimes , it is claimed that vacuum energy for one or another reason does not influence gravitational field .    in this paper , following ideas presented in ( broda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , we show in what sense quantum vacuum energy influences gravitational field , and in what sense it does not .",
    "actually , we propose a reasonable derivation of a contribution of quantum vacuum energy which influences gravitational field , and which assumes an experimentally reasonable value .",
    "the standard approach ( weinberg @xcite ) to estimate the quantum vacuum energy density @xmath1 in the spirit of casimir energy yields for a single bosonic scalar mode @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mass of the mode .",
    "for the planckian uv cutoff , @xmath4 , we obtain @xmath5 , whereas the experimentally estimated value is of the order of the critical density of the universe , @xmath6 .    in our opinion",
    ", the explicitly absurd result follows from an erroneous approach .",
    "namely , in classical as well as in quantum theory interactions are being mediated by fields or particles . in eq .",
    "no explicit or implicit coupling to gravitational field appears on any stage .",
    "therefore , by construction , we assume that gravitation does not couple ( is insensitive ) to the term .",
    "as there is no any coupling to , its huge value is isolated from the outer world and therefore invisible ( non - existent ) .",
    "what we have just said is , so to say , a negative part of our reasoning .",
    "in the positive part we should cure the situation somehow proposing a reasonable solution . in ( broda _",
    "@xcite ) we have sketched our idea and proposed an estimation of the quantum vacuum energy . actually , it is possible to allow another interpretation of our calculations .",
    "for example , in our opinion , the idea of `` the rearrangement '' of vacuum motivated by thermodynamics and condensed - matter physics advocated in ( volovik ( @xcite , @xcite ) ) could be implemented just this way .",
    "anyway , our original calculus ( broda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) consists in careful considering only contributions coming from attached classical external lines .",
    "more precisely , in the first step , we should estimate quantum vacuum fluctuations of a matter field in the background of an external classical gravitational field . in the next step",
    "we should retain the most divergent part and subtract the term without gravitational field .",
    "we will work in the formalism of the effective action , throughout .",
    "a euclidean version of our approach has been given in ( broda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , and here we present a relativistic one .",
    "full quantum contribution to the effective action coming from a single ( non - self - interacting ) mode is ( dewitt ( @xcite , @xcite ) ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a second - order differential operator , in general , with classical external fields , and the upper ( plus ) sign corresponds to a boson , whereas the lower ( minus ) one corresponds to a fermion , respectively .",
    "proper - time uv regularized version of in schwinger s formalism assumes the form ( birrell & davies @xcite ) , ( dewitt ( @xcite , @xcite ) ) @xmath9 next , we apply the seeley ",
    "dewitt `` heat - kernel '' expansion in four dimensions ( birrell & davies @xcite ) , ( dewitt ( @xcite , @xcite ) ) , ( ball @xcite ) , @xmath10 the contribution coming from the first term , we are interested , i.e.  @xmath11 , is @xmath12 since @xmath13 , and for planckian uv cutoff @xmath14 , we obtain @xmath15 for simplicity , we confine ourselves to the spatially flat friedmann  lematre  robertson ",
    "walker metric with the scale factor @xmath16 . to ease our calculus further",
    ", we set the present coordinate time @xmath17 , and normalize the coordinates to unity , i.e.  @xmath18 . expanding @xmath16 around @xmath17 we have @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the present day hubble expansion rate , and",
    "@xmath21 is the present day deceleration parameter . hence @xmath22^{3/2}=\\left[1",

    "there are also general arguments supporting this cancellation given in ( shapiro @xcite ) .",
    "therefore @xmath26 and @xmath27\\mathrm{d}t \\int{\\mathrm{d}}^3x .",
    "\\label{eq : a0vacuumactioncontribution3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the number one in the bracket corresponds to the term uncoupled to gravitational field , and it should be subtracted . by the way ,",
    "such a subtraction is a standard procedure in quantum field theory .",
    "as we are interested in a density rather than in a total value we should get rid off all integrals . since the integrand is only time - dependent we can simply discard the spatial volume @xmath28 .",
    "as far as the time integrand is concerned we should take into account that our calculus is perturbative in @xmath25 and valid only in the vicinity of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we have to take the limit of `` infinitesimal '' time . from the point of view of quantum field theory",
    "the `` infinitesimal '' time is the planck time @xmath29 .",
    "so , our density is a time average , i.e.  @xmath30 , and assumes the form @xmath31 or finally @xmath32 where we have used the relation : @xmath33 . for , e.g.  @xmath34 ( virey _ et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we get @xmath35 a very promising result .",
    "in the framework of standard quantum field theory , without any additional more or less exotic assumptions we are able to derive an experimentally reasonable result .",
    "this numeric value corresponds to only a single mode .",
    "therefore in the real world it should be multiplied by a small natural number .",
    "this work was supported in part by the polish ministry of science and higher education grant pbz / min/008/p03/2003 and by the university of d grant .",
    "one of the authors ( b.b . ) would like to thank the organizers for their kind invitation and for their generous support ."
