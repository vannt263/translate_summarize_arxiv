    "schubert s homotopy - associative connect - sum mapping @xmath24 is enhanced to an action of the operad of @xmath12-cubes @xmath25 on @xmath11 , giving an explicit operadic parametrization of the kinds of isotopies depicted above .",
    "the main theorem of @xcite is that @xmath11 is free as an algebra over the @xmath12-cubes operad @xmath26 , which when we apply @xmath27 recovers schubert s result , since @xmath28 .",
    "schubert went on to further decompose knots using what he called _",
    "satellite operations _ in his massive paper _ knoten und vollringe _ @xcite . as schubert noticed",
    ", there are many ways to construct the same knot via distinct satellite operations . in hindsight",
    "we know this was partially an accident of notation , as schubert s notion of satellite operation was too linearly presented to see the symmetries inherent in the process of constructing satellite knots .",
    "further , satellite constructions produce knots with incompressible tori in their complements , so the uniqueness statement must be tied to the jsj - decomposition of 3-manifolds .",
    "the uniqueness statement for the jsj decomposition is quite delicate and in some sense its delicate nature was a key factor in it being difficult to find .",
    "it has been pointed out several times since and in several different contexts @xcite that when reinterpreted via larry siebenmann s less linearly - ordered notion of _ splicing _",
    "@xcite there is a unique decomposition theorem for satellite knots .",
    "the primary point of this paper is to do for splicing what ` little cubes and long knots ' @xcite did for the connect - sum operation .",
    "an operadic space - level encoding of splicing is given in proposition [ def2 ] .",
    "theorem [ freenessthm ] shows @xmath11 to be a free algebra over the splicing operad @xmath9 , with free generating subspace the torus and hyperbolic knots @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "this provides a pleasant linkage between the low - dimensional topologists view of knots ( that torus and hyperbolic knots are in some sense the most essential ) , with the algebraic topologist s language of operads .",
    "further , it forms a link between the usage of trees in the study of operads to depict iterated composites of the structure maps with trees in 3-manifold theory , used to depict the structure of the jsj - decomposition of a knot or link complement in @xmath6 .",
    "this is closely related to the somewhat unsatisfactory recursive structure of the homology of the long knot space @xmath11 viewed as an algebra over the operad of @xmath12-cubes @xcite .",
    "the main result of @xcite is that @xmath11 as an algebra over the operad of little @xmath12-cubes is free , where the free generating subspace is the space @xmath13 of prime long knots , i.e. @xmath26 . as was observed in @xcite and @xcite , the homology of @xmath31 has a deeper structure coming from the splicing decomposition of knots , forcing @xmath32 to reappear in shifted degrees inside @xmath33 in many ways .",
    "the non - operadic nature of the description of @xmath11 given in @xcite is non - uniform and somewhat frustrating .",
    "these complications largely disappear when @xmath11 is viewed through the lens of the splicing operad @xmath9 .",
    "theorem [ operadstruc ] shows the splicing operad @xmath9 to be a free product ( in the category of @xmath16-operads ) of @xmath15 ( not the framed discs operad , but a different semi - direct product ) and various free operads .",
    "the other free summands of @xmath9 correspond to cabling operations and hyperbolic satellite operations .",
    "moreover , all these summands with the sole exception of @xmath15 are free operads , freely generated on certain @xmath34-spaces , whose equivariant homotopy - type is identified in theorem [ operadstruc ] .",
    "a secondary point of this paper is that these techniques extend beyond the realm of classical knots .",
    "there are splicing operads that act on a wide class of spaces of self - embeddings @xmath0 , for @xmath1 a compact manifold .",
    "this includes the spaces @xmath2 and @xmath35 @xcite of self - embeddings @xmath3 with support contained in @xmath36^j \\times m$ ] and @xmath37 respectively , but the definition of the splicing operad applies to more general self - embedding spaces , some are discussed briefly in section [ futuredir ] . in particular , the splicing operad for the ` cubically supported embedding spaces ' @xmath2 is generally richer than the action of the corresponding action of the @xmath5-cubes operad on @xmath2 .",
    "the splicing operad differs significantly from the operad of cubes , in that the splicing operad is an infinite - dimensional frecht manifold , i.e. it is ` big ' when compared to many traditional operads , which tend to be levelwise finite - dimensional .",
    "another large - scale difference is that while the operad of @xmath5-cubes acts on the space @xmath2 for all compact manifolds @xmath38 , there are distinct splicing operads for @xmath2 and @xmath39 provided @xmath38 and @xmath1 are distinct .",
    "perhaps this new operad will lead to new insights into the homotopy - types of these embedding spaces .",
