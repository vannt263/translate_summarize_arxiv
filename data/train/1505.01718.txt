    "nowadays , the inclusive hadroproduction of pairs of isolated prompt photons ( diphotons ) is a subject of intense experimental and theoretical studies . from the experimental point of view",
    ", this process forms an irreducible background in the searches of heavy neutral resonances in the diphoton decay channel , such as standard model higgs boson  @xcite and it s beyond standard model counterparts  @xcite . as for the process itself",
    ", it allows us to define the set of inclusive differential cross sections over such variables as the invariant mass of the pair ( @xmath3 ) , it s transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) , azimuthal angle between transverse momenta of the photons ( @xmath4 ) , rapidity of the photon pair ( @xmath5 ) , collins - soper angle in the center of mass frame of the photon pair ( @xmath6 ) and a few others  @xcite .",
    "most of these spectra are measured with high precision both at tevatron  @xcite and the lhc  @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "providing the predictions for the above mentioned rich set of differential spectra is a challenging task even for the state of the art techniques in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) . while , for the inclusive isolated prompt photon production , the @xmath2-spectra from cdf  @xcite , atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite are described within experimental uncertainties in the next to leading order ( nlo ) of conventional collinear parton model ( cpm ) of the qcd  @xcite .",
    "also , the notably good results where obtained for these spectra already in the leading order ( lo ) of @xmath7-factorization in the ref .  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , existing nlo cpm calculations , implemented in the ` diphox `  @xcite monte - carlo event generator , provide very poor description of @xmath2 and @xmath4 distributions measured by atlas  @xcite . in the cpm",
    ", the full nnlo accuracy is required to provide qualitatively reasonable description of all distributions  @xcite .",
    "part of these difficulties can be traced back to the shortcomings of the cpm approximation , where the transverse momentum of initial state partons is integrated over in the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , but neglected in the hard scattering part of the process .",
    "such treatment is justified for the fully inclusive single scale observables , such as deep inelastic scattering structure functions or @xmath2-spectra of single prompt photons and jets , where the corrections breaking the collinear factorization are shown to be suppressed by a powers of the hard scale  @xcite .    for the multi - scale differential observables",
    ", there is no obvious reason why the fixed - order calculation in the cpm should be a good approximation .",
    "usually the simple picture of factorization of the cross section of the hard process into the convolution of hard - scattering coefficient and some pdf - like objects is kept , but kinematical approximations are relaxed . in the treatment of initial state radiation ( isr ) corrections in the soft collinear",
    "effective theory ( scet )  @xcite or in the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) factorization formalism  @xcite , the transverse - momentum of the initial - state parton is kept unintegrated on the kinematical level , but neglected in the hard - scattering part , which is justified e.  g. when the @xmath2 of the exclusive final state is much smaller than it s invariant mass , so that the following hierarchy of the light - cone momentum components for the initial - state parton is preserved : @xmath8 .    in the opposite limit , when @xmath9 , the @xmath7-factorization  @xcite is valid , and transverse momentum of the initial state parton can no longer be neglected in the hard scattering amplitudes . to obtain the suitable hard scattering matrix element",
    "we will apply the hypothesis of parton reggeization , which will be described below . in what follows",
    "we will refer to the combination of @xmath7-factorization with hard scattering matrix elements with reggeized partons in the initial state as the parton reggeization approach ( pra ) .",
    "this approach is mostly suitable for the study of the production of the final states with high @xmath2 and small invariant mass in the central rapidity region . at high energies @xmath10 ,",
    "such final states are produced by the small-@xmath11 partons , and the resummation of @xmath12-enhanced terms into the unintegrated pdf ( unpdf ) can be implemented  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the regions of applicability of the tmd and @xmath7-factorization are overlapping , and they should match when @xmath13 .    turning back to the photon pair production , we can conclude , that neither tmd nor @xmath7-factorization covers all available range of experimental data .",
    "most of the cross section comes from the region where the diphoton has small @xmath2 and photons fly nearly back - to - back in the transverse plane , so additional qcd radiation is kinematically constrained to be soft and collinear , and the approach of scet factorization will be preferable . on the contrary , at high @xmath2 and small @xmath4 , the @xmath7-factorization will do a good job , as we will show below .",
    "the previous attempts to study the prompt diphoton production in @xmath7-factorization  @xcite had their own problems . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , only lo @xmath14 subprocesses where taken into account .",
    "while , the pra was used to obtain the gauge invariant expression for the @xmath15 matrix element with off - shell initial state reggeized quarks ( @xmath16 ) , the matrix element for the @xmath1 with off - shell reggeized gluons in the initial state was taken the same as in the cpm .",
    "in fact , this contribution was overestimated in ref .",
    "@xcite due to the erroneous overall factor 4 in the partonic cross section of the subprocess @xmath17 presented in the ref .",
    "@xcite , which have lead to the accidental agreement with the early tevatron data  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : box ] of the present paper .    in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the attempt to take into account the nlo @xmath19 subprocesses was made , but manifestly non gauge invariant matrix elements where used both for @xmath14 and @xmath19 subprocesses .",
    "also , the unavoidable double counting of additional real radiations between nlo @xmath20 subprocess and the unpdf was not subtracted , which have lead to the questionable conclusion , that no resummation of the effects of soft radiation is needed in the small-@xmath2 region to describe the data .    in view of above mentioned shortcomings of the previous calculations , the present study has two main goals .",
    "the first one is to calculate the real part of nlo corrections to the process under consideration in the pra , and develop the technique of subtraction of double counting between real nlo corrections and unpdf in pra .",
    "the second goal is to calculate the matrix element of the quark - box subprocess @xmath1 in pra , taking into account the exact dependence on the transverse momenta of initial - state reggeized gluons .",

    "[ sec : basicpra ] the relevant basics of the pra formalism are outlined and the amplitude for the lo subprocess @xmath15 is derived . in the sec .",

    "as collinear factorization is based on the property of factorization of collinear singularities in qcd  @xcite , the @xmath7-factorization is based on the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl )  @xcite ( see  @xcite for the review ) factorization of qcd amplitudes in the multi - regge kinematics ( mrk ) , i. e. in the limit of the high scattering energy and fixed momentum transfers .",
    "for example , the amplitude for the subprocess @xmath21 in the limit when @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , has the form of the amplitude with exchange of the effective reggeized particle in the @xmath25-channel : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the color indices , @xmath30 is the effective @xmath31 vertex , @xmath32 is the central gluon production vertex @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the gluon regge trajectory .",
    "the slavnov - taylor identity @xmath35 holds for the effective production vertex , which ensures the gauge invariance of the amplitude .",
    "the analogous form for the mrk asymptotics of the amplitude with quark exchange in the @xmath25-channel was shown to hold in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) in  @xcite .",
    "for the review of modern status of the quark reggeization in qcd see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the regge factor @xmath36 resums the loop corrections enhanced by the @xmath37 to all orders in strong coupling constant @xmath38 , and the dependence on the arbitrary scale @xmath39 should be canceled by the analogous dependence of the effective vertices , taken in all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "the reggeized gluon in the @xmath25-channel is a scalar particle in the adjoint representation of the @xmath40 . in the mrk limit ,",
    "when all three particles in the final state are highly separated in rapidity , the light - cone momentum components carried by the reggeons in @xmath25-channels obey the hierarchy @xmath41 , so in the strict mrk limit , the `` small '' light - cone component is usually neglected .    to go beyond the lla in @xmath37 , one needs to consider the processes with a few clusters of particles in the final state , which are highly separated in rapidity , but keeping the exact kinematics within clusters .",
    "this is so called quasi - multi - regge kinematics(qmrk ) , and to obtain the amplitudes in this limit , the gauge invariant effective action for high energy processes in qcd was introduced in the ref .",
    "apart from the usual quark and gluon fields of qcd , which are supposed to live within a fixed rapidity interval , the fields of reggeized gluons  @xcite and reggeized quarks  @xcite are introduced to communicate between the different rapidity intervals . to keep the @xmath25-channel factorized form of the amplitudes in the qmrk limit",
    ", the reggeon fields have to be gauge invariant , which leads to the specific form of their nonlocal interaction with the usual qcd fields , containing the wilson lines .",
    "gauge invariance of reggeon fields also ensures the gauge invariance of the effective emission vertices , which describe the production of particles within the given interval of rapidity , as it was the case in  ( [ ampl_mrk ] ) .",
    "the feynman rules ( frs ) of the effective theory are collected in the refs .",

    "so far as , the form of the central production vertex , propagators of reggeized gluons and regge trajectories , depends only on the quantum numbers of the reggeon in the @xmath25-channel , and do not depend on what particles are in the initial state , the cross section of the production of particles to the central rapidity region in the inelastic @xmath42 collisions can be written in the form  @xcite : @xmath43 where the sums are taken over the parton species , @xmath44 are the momenta of the partons , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the four - momenta of the protons , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the partonic cross section with reggeized partons in the initial state . in what follows",
    "we will often use the sudakov decomposition of the momenta : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the unpdf @xmath55 is unintegrated over the transverse momentum @xmath56 , but still integrated over the `` small '' light - cone component of momentum , so this light - cone component is neglected in the hard scattering part , which is hence _ formally _ in the qmrk with the isr and therefore it is gauge invariant .",

    "the factorization scale @xmath57 is introduced to keep track of the position of the hard process on the axis of rapidity .",
    "the unpdf is normalized on the cpm number density pdf via : @xmath58    in the case of an inelastic scattering of objects with intrinsic hard scale , such as photons with high center - of - mass energy and virtuality , the evolution of the unpdfs is governed by the large @xmath12 and they satisfy the bfkl evolution equation  @xcite . in proton - proton collisions ,",
    "the initial state does not provide us with intrinsic hard scale , therefore , the @xmath7-ordered dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap )  @xcite evolution at small @xmath7 should be merged with rapidity - ordered bfkl evolution at high-@xmath7 final steps of the isr cascade .",

    "the definition of the hard - scattering coefficient @xmath48 is independent on the approximations made in the unpdf , so any unpdf can be used , and spread between them gives the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "in fact , the recent studies  @xcite show , that in the realistic kinematical conditions , the lo calculations with kmr and recent version of the ccfm unpdfs  @xcite give very close results . at the nlo",
    ", one should develop the proper matching scheme between the unpdf and corrections included into the hard - scattering kernel , which introduces a difference in treatment of different unpdfs .    in the present paper we will work with the version of the kmr formula for the unpdfs , described in the ref .",
    "the kmr prescription introduces the simplest possible scenario , where the @xmath7-ordered dglap chain of the emissions is followed by exactly one emission , ordered in rapidity with the particles produced in the hard subprocess . due to the strong @xmath7-ordering of the dglap evolution",
    ", the transverse momentum of the parton in the initial - state of the hard subprocess is approximated to come completely from the last step of the evolution . with this approximations",

    "this collinear singularity can be absorbed into the nonperturbative parton - to - photon fragmentation function , and then , the theoretical cross section is represented as the sum of _ direct _ contribution , where the collinear singularity is subtracted , according to e.  g. @xmath95 scheme , and _ fragmentation _ contribution , which is equal to the convolution of the cross section of the parton production in pqcd and the parton - to - photon fragmentation function .",

    "the cross section of the subprocess ( [ proc : qqgagag ] ) is also finite , because the sudakov formfactor decreases in the region @xmath107 faster than any positive power of @xmath108 and therefore regularizes the collinear and soft singularities of the matrix element of the subprocess  ( [ proc : qqgagag ] ) in the limit of @xmath109 .    in the factorization formula ( [ eqn : ktfact ] ) , the part of the isr , highly separated in rapidity from the particles produced in the hard subprocess is included into unpdfs , and the effects of the additional radiations close in rapidity to the hard subprocess , should be taken order by order in @xmath38 in the hard - scattering coefficient . therefore , the corresponding mrk asymptotics should be subtracted from the nlo qmrk contributions  ( [ proc : qrgagaq ] ) , and ( [ proc : qqgagag ] ) to avoid the double counting , when the additional parton is highly separated in rapidity from the central region .",
