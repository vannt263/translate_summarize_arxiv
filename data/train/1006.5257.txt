    "there are two types of spin dimer formation , with or without spin - phonon interaction , i.e. , whether there is phonon assisted local structure distortion as singlet dimer forms . since the phonon assisted spin - peierls transition requires translational symmetry breaking , i.e. , the lattice doubling which loses translational symmetry to open a gap near the fermi level , which is a collective phenomenon for the one - dimensional spin system .",
    "although the magnetic field dependence of _ t@xmath1 _ shown in figure [ fig : fig07 ] suggests that the gapped phase has a spin peierls system character , we have not found evidence of lattice doubling from synchrotron x - ray diffraction results so far . in fact , it is not expected to be observed based on phase separation model , i.e. , the phase fraction of isolated dimers is proportional to the zn level of @xmath67 10@xmath3 only . on the other hand , we find that _",
    "j@xmath0 _ and _ j@xmath31 _ are both antiferromagnetic and of comparable strength according to lda calculation and neutron scattering spin wave analysis.@xcite spins near zn pair centers must face the frustrating interaction between antiferromagnetic _ j@xmath0 _ and _ j@xmath31_. interestingly , several lda and spin wave analysis models suggest the ratio of antiferromagnetic _ j@xmath31_/_j@xmath0 _ to be near 1/2 , another condition that satisfies the majumdar - ghosh dimerization without phonon assisted lattice distortion.@xcite whether the dimerization occurs with or without phonon interaction , a local probe on subtle structure distortion is necessary ; however , it would be difficult to verify if only a fraction ( @xmath2 _ z _ ) of the spins to demonstrate spin dimerization .    microscopic phase separation due to extrinsic inhomogeneity can often been observed in samples prepared in powder form or thin film on a substrate . on the other hand",
    ", phase separation of electronic origin could be an intrinsic property in a strongly correlated material system and has attracted studies from many aspects , particularly for superconductor and colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) materials.@xcite since current finite size effect and spin dimer glass behavior are observed in single crystal sample with randomly distributed zero spin ions on a quantum frustrating helimagnetic background , the phase separation phenomenon in zn substituted licu@xmath0o@xmath0 system must be of electronic origin .",
    "in particular , even though the driving force remains to be explored theoretically , separated phases distinguished by different spin order / disorder types are unique and have never been reported before to our knowledge .",
    "it is interesting to note that the phase diagram summarized in figure [ fig : fig05 ] shows high similarity to phase boundary and zn dependence for the general phase diagram as summarized by bobroff _",
    "et al . _ on zn",
    "substituted spin gapped systems.@xcite for the gapped systems including isolated ladders , haldane or spin - peierls chains , zn impurities are proposed to induce extended magnetic moments that freeze at low temperatures .",
    "zn impurities must introduce similar residue spins as shown in figure [ fig : fig15 ] on the spiral ordered background , which could explain the spin freezing phenomenon observed near @xmath2 5 k from nmr and magnetic susceptibility measurement results discussed above .",
    "the existence of singlet spin dimer has been predicted from dmrg - type algorithm calculation by furukawa _",
    "et al . _ for one - dimensional quantum frustrated spin chain with a hamiltonian similar to equation [ eq : one ] , where nontrivial easy plane exchange anisotropy is considered also in order to simulate the asymmetric @xmath73li nmr spectra accurately.@xcite we note that the high zn substituted samples with _",
    "ratios summarized in table  [ tab : tableii ] could fall in the range of dimerization according to the phase diagram constructed by easy - plane anisotropy vs. _ j@xmath7/j@xmath0 _ as proposed by furukawa _",
    "et al._. in particular , the _ j@xmath0/j@xmath7 _ ratio drops significantly as system crosses over the @xmath25.5@xmath3 zn boundary from the original chiral spin ordering to the partially gapped spin dimerization state .",
    "however , we must point out that the phase diagram proposed by furukawa _ et al . _",
    "is based on an infinite chain system calculation while current zn substituted spin chains are finite of unequal lengths , which could explain why the dimerization does not open the spin gap fully but with a size proportional to the zn substitution level .",
    "finally , the current results also bring in an interesting connection to the possibility of experimental realization of the long sought resonant valence bond ( rvb ) state . for a zigzag spin chain system",
    ", it has been shown that the rvb state is the exact ground state at the ratio of _ _",
    "j@xmath0/j@xmath7__= -1/4.@xcite since figure [ fig : fig09 ] shows that _ j@xmath7 _ remains nearly invariant while _",
    "j@xmath0 _ decreases with the increasing zn , one might view our system is actually approaching this rvb critical point at high zn level , i.e. , zn level higher than @xmath25.5@xmath3 is near the onset of the rvb state .",
    "the rvb state on a finite spin chain due to spinless zn substitution has gapped low - lying excitations which give rise to a cusp shaped susceptibility as indicated in figure [ fig : fig05]b . clearly more theoretical exploration is necessary when interchain coupling and easy - plane anisotropy are considered .",
    "in conclusion , we have used nonmagnetic zn substitution to explore the quantum quasi - two - dimensional helimagnet licu@xmath0o@xmath0 .",
    "zn substitution moves the frustrated spin system closer to the quantum critical ferromagnetic boundary near @xmath8 = -1/4 on the _ j@xmath0 _ vs. _",
    "j@xmath7 _ phase diagram .",
    "two kinds of magnetic orderings have been found crossing the _ t - z _ phase boundary for _ z _ near @xmath2 5.5 @xmath3 per cuo@xmath0 chain .",
    "low zn substitution reduces the spiral ordering transition temperatures significantly , following a finite size scaling law , which implies the existence of two - dimensional helimagnetic domains confined by isolated spins , and these isolated spins could be transported as a soliton through the frustrating spin background to the domain boundaries .",
    "such spin phase separation is uniquely observed for the first time in a two - dimensional helimagnetic background .",
    "high zn substitution introduces a gapped phase that shows spin - peierls character and that the phase fraction is proportional to the zn substitution level .",
    "the proposed interpretations on phase separation , spin dimerization and spin freezing require more microscopic experimental evidences and muon spin resonance investigation of the title compound is under way .",
