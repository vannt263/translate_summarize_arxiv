    "dynamical systems involving networks of interacting elements arise in many fields , including chemistry , systems biology , ecosystem modelling , and even beyond the natural sciences .",
    "the description of these systems requires enumeration of the * species * involved and the * interactions * between them .",
    "associated with a species is a `` state '' , usually a population or a concentration , and associated with an interaction is a `` rate '' which describes the frequency of the interaction .",
    "an important theoretical question is : `` what claims can be made on the basis only of qualitative knowledge of the interactions , i.e. without detailed knowledge of functional forms and parameter values ? '' . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with questions of _ injectivity _ and hence the ability of systems to have multiple equilibria .",
    "in particular :    1 .   given a wide class of systems ( to be defined below ) we show how to associate with each such system an object termed a dsr graph ; 2 .",
    "we then show how a simple computation , or even observation , on this dsr graph can suffice to tell us that a system can not have multiple equilibria ( because the associated vector field is injective ) .",
    "the results presented here largely build on those in @xcite .",
    "however the graph - theoretic work in this paper is closely connected to two previous strands of work : discussions of injectivity / multiple equilibria via * interaction graphs * @xcite , and discussions of injectivity in chemical reaction networks ( crns ) with reference to so - called * sr graphs * @xcite .",
    "the classes of systems treated in these references are special cases of interaction networks , as defined generally here .",
    "there is also other important work in this tradition .",
    "for example , graph - theoretic approaches to questions of monotonicity appear in @xcite and several results in @xcite have easy graph - theoretic interpretations . important questions of persistence in crns are treated graph - theoretically in @xcite .",
    "the main result is that given any interaction network it is possible to construct a multigraph called the * directed sr graph * ( dsr graph ) , and check a condition on this graph which will rule out the possibility of multiple equilibria . at a practical level",
    ", the dsr graph is an intuitively meaningful object , closely related to the diagrams drawn by researchers in biochemistry and chemical engineering .",
    "the condition sufficient for injectivity , here termed * condition  ( @xmath0 ) * , is simple to state and has been previously presented @xcite .",
    "what is remarkable is that a condition originally developed for crns with mass action kinetics @xcite , and then generalised to crns with looser kinetics @xcite , can actually be applied to arbitrary networks of interacting elements .    before proving any results",
    ", we will discuss the notion of an `` interaction network '' , both informally and formally .",
    "we will see that essentially arbitrary dynamical systems on appropriate subsets of @xmath1 can be cast as interaction networks , and thus the results in this paper have wide applicability .",
    "a species @xmath2 may participate in an interaction @xmath3 in the following three ways :    1 .   * two - way * ( @xmath4 ) : the species influences the interaction and is itself influenced by the interaction .",
    "species - to - interaction * ( @xmath5 ) : the species influences the interaction , but is unaffected by the interaction .",
    "* interaction - to - species * ( @xmath6 ) : the species is influenced by the interaction , but does not affect the interaction .",
    "case ( 1 ) describes perhaps the most common situation . during predation , for example",
    ", we expect the population of prey both to affect the rate of predation and to be affected by it . in case",
    "( 2 ) the species is a * modulator * of the interaction , and this modulation may be in a defined direction ( `` activation '' or `` inhibition '' ) or an undefined direction .",
    "for example , a simplification common in crn modelling is to treat enzymes as modulators of reactions . in case ( 3 ) , we say that the species participates * irreversibly * in the interaction .",
    "note that this is slightly different to the usual definition of irreversibility for a chemical reaction , because by this definition , if a species @xmath2 is the product of an irreversible reaction and it affects the rate of that reaction , then we say that @xmath2 participates in that reaction _ reversibly _ , even though the reaction could never run backwards ( see for example the model of the tca cycle presented later ) .",
    "a key feature of the dsr graph associated with an interaction network is that it has two types of vertices , one representing the species , and another representing the interactions . a species vertex @xmath2 and interaction vertex @xmath3 may be linked by up to two edges , which may be directed or undirected .",
    "these encode information about how species @xmath2 affects the rate of interaction @xmath3 , and conversely how the dynamics of @xmath2 are affected by the rate of interaction .",
    "a formal treatment will be developed later , but the reader might like to glance at appendix  [ appdsr ] to get a feel for the meanings of various _ motifs _ in dsr graphs .",
    "a subset @xmath7 of @xmath1 is a rectangular domain iff for @xmath8 there exist quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 satisfying @xmath11 , and for each @xmath12^t \\in x$ ] @xmath13 here the symbol @xmath14 can mean @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "for example @xmath7 could be all of @xmath1 , an orthant , etc .",
    "note that @xmath7 may be of lower dimension than @xmath1 .",
    "* injectivity and multiple equilibria . * a function @xmath17 between arbitrary spaces @xmath7 and @xmath18 is * injective",
    "* iff whenever @xmath19 , @xmath20 , then @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 , and @xmath23 an arbitrary @xmath24 ( i.e. continuously differentiable ) function on @xmath7 . supposing some model of the natural world gives rise to a vector field @xmath25 , or the map @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "suppose further that we have incomplete data , so that all we know is that @xmath28 belongs to some set of functions @xmath29 , but by some means we can show that all @xmath30 are injective .",
    "this immediately implies that each @xmath30 can have no more than one zero , i.e. the vector field can have no more than one equilibrium , or the map no more than one fixed point .    *",
    "the key idea : decomposing functions . *",
    "our central theme in this paper is the following : we start with a set of functions @xmath29 from some rectangular domain @xmath22 to @xmath1 .",
    "now for some integer @xmath31 , and for each @xmath30 we write @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ". such decompositions always exist ( for example we can choose @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 to be the identity , or vice versa ) , but often there are natural decompositions implied by the way that the models are constructed .",
    "intuitively , we can think of @xmath7 as `` species space '' , the set of allowed species values , and @xmath38 as `` interaction space '' , the space of allowed interaction rates .",
    "differentiating @xmath32 gives @xmath39 , i.e. the jacobian @xmath40 has a natural product structure .",
    "specifically , @xmath41 encodes information about how interaction @xmath42 affects affects quantity @xmath43 , while @xmath44 encodes information about how quantity @xmath43 affects the rate of interaction @xmath42 .",
    "* @xmath45 matrices . * the product structure in the jacobian forms the theoretical starting point for the subsequent treatment . in particular , the class of @xmath45 matrices ( defined in appendix  [ app1 ] ) is shown to be a useful class to consider when asking questions about injectivity .",
    "two very general lemmas are developed : lemma  [ genlem ] gives a sufficient condition for any set of matrices with product structure to be @xmath45 matrices ; lemma  [ genlemconv ] provides restrictions under which the sufficient conditions in lemma  [ genlem ] are also necessary .",
    "* dsr graph results .",
    "* while the matrix - theoretic approaches give sharp results , there are very elegant and intuitive graph - theoretic results which arise as corollaries of these . roughly speaking ,",
    "the dsr graph is constructed as follows : returning to the decomposition of the jacobian @xmath39 , the elements @xmath41 and @xmath44 together contain information on how species @xmath43 is affected by , and affects , interaction @xmath42 , and unless both are identically zero , together they map to one or more edges between species vertex @xmath43 and interaction vertex @xmath42 in the dsr graph . via a series of lemmas",
    "we find that a previously developed condition on cycles in the sr graph , restated for the dsr graph , guarantees injectivity of the interaction network with some outflow / degradation of each species .",
    "the implications for multiple equilibria under different assumptions are summarised in corollary  [ maincor ] , which can be seen as the main result in this paper .      before presenting the theoretical development , or even rigorously defining interaction networks and dsr graphs , it is helpful to present a nontrivial example .",
    "further discussion of this and other examples will be provided after development of the theory .",
    "we consider the model of the tca cycle discussed in @xcite .",
    "the model is a fairly complicated biological model , and is presented in stages . at each stage the relevant question is whether it can admit `` multiple positive nondegenerate equilibria '' , a notion to be made precise later .",
    "the backbone of the model is a cycle of eight interconversions , that is , very basic chemical reactions in which one substrate is simply converted into another .",
    "importantly , some of the reactions are assumed to be irreversible while others are reversible .",
    "the dsr graph for the model at four different levels of complexity is shown in figure  [ srtca ] .    at ( -6,6 )",

    "first , several of the reactions appear as reversible in the dsr graph ( in particular the production of fumarate and oxaloacetate ) because although the functional forms given in @xcite may only permit the reaction to proceed in one direction , the reaction rates are inhibited by the reaction products .",
    "secondly , given a conserved pair such as nad / nadh , one can write @xmath65 = \\mathrm{nad_{tot } } - [ \\mathrm{nadh}]$ ] for some constant @xmath590 to eliminate @xmath591 from the system and simplify the dsr graph .",
    "subsequently all claims refer to the system with some fixed value of @xmath590 , i.e. on some fixed stoichiometric class .",
    "this procedure works well with a conserved pair , but is not necessarily helpful with more general conserved quantities , possibly introducing a number of additional edges into the dsr graph .    at the first stage of construction , shown in figure  [ srtca]a",
    ", the dsr graph has a single es - cycle and fulfils condition  ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "adding in the inhibition by oxaloacetate of succinate dehydrogenase ( figure  [ srtca]b ) introduces a single o - cycle with undefined stoichiometry .",
    "it does _ not _ introduce an e - cycle with undefined stoichiometry , precisely because some of the reactions are irreversible ( in the strong sense ) , indicating again the importance of considerations of reversibility which would be missed by analysis using the sr graph alone .",
    "introducing @xmath592 adds a single s - vertex and three extra positive edges ( with edge - labels @xmath593 ) to the dsr graph ( figure  [ srtca]c ) .",
    "all these are undirected whether or not the reactions are reversible in the chemical sense , because an increase in the level of nadh is equivalent to a drop in the level of nad , and so affects the reaction rate .",
    "this adds a great number of cycles to the graph , but they are all o - cycles . finally , adding the aat - catalysed reaction ( figure  [ srtca]d ) , leads to the creation of yet more cycles .",
    "now the graph violates condition  ( @xmath0 ) , both because it contains e - cycles which fail to be s - cycles ( e.g. oaa-@xmath576-fum-@xmath594-mal-@xmath595-nadh-@xmath346-@xmath596-@xmath597-oaa ) and because it contains es - cycles with s - to - r intersection .",
    "note that even at this stage some model quantities , in particular adp , calcium , and membrane potential are omitted from the analysis .",
    "this example illustrates that even in models where we can not positively rule out multiple equilibria , by identifying cycles which cause condition  ( @xmath0 ) to be violated , we can speculate on the mechanisms by which multistationarity may arise .",
    "we have shown that the dsr graph , an object closely related to the pathway diagrams and interaction diagrams drawn by applied scientists in various fields , can be used to rule out the possibility of multiple equilibria or multiple nondegenerate equilibria .",
    "given a systems written in one of the forms @xmath598 we construct the dsr graph for the associated systems @xmath599 , and check whether condition  ( @xmath0 ) holds for this graph .",
    "if it does then we know that all of @xmath600 are injective and that all of @xmath601 forbid multiple nondegenerate equilibria on the relative interior of any invariant affine set .",
    "algorithmic development is clearly important at this stage .",
    "simple , widely available , computational tools to test whether condition  ( @xmath0 ) holds for a dsr graph will open up the possibility of routine preliminary model analysis : modellers working with qualitative models will be able to check whether their models , as a result of structure alone , forbid multiple equilibria , before parametrisation and simulation .",
    "we are currently working on creating user - friendly software that performs this test .",
    "it is worth remembering that matrix - theoretic approaches give sharper results than the graph - theoretic ones .",
    "as mentioned in the text , lemmas  [ genlem ]  and  [ genlemconv ] simplify in a number of special cases where we have additional knowledge of a system ( e.g. reversibility of all processes ) .",

    "a number of special cases can be treated via minor variants on this analysis .",
    "some systems on the nonnegative orthant , for example population models , generally have boundary equilibria , and one question is whether they admit multiple positive equilibria .",
    "the general theory developed here can be applied in this context , for example to a lotka - volterra type model for the evolution of @xmath67 species of the form @xmath602 @xcite where @xmath69^t$ ] is the nonnegative vector of species concentrations , and the functions @xmath603 encode information on the interactions between species .",
    "positive equilibria must satisfy @xmath604 , and hence we are interested in injectivity of @xmath605^t$ ] in the interior of the positive orthant , which can be treated using the techniques developed here .",
    "the example in section  [ exnotinteraction ] illustrated that even trivial decompositions can be useful .",
    "in fact , in forthcoming work , we will show how given an arbitrary dynamical system @xmath606 on a rectangular domain , and using the trivial decomposition @xmath607 , it is possible to obtain stronger results than the well - known interaction graph results on injectivity ( results in @xcite for example ) .",
    "however , the example in section  [ ex1section ] illustrated the important and subtle point that in some cases the strongest results are obtained by choosing the `` correct '' decomposition of the functions we hope to show are injective .",
    "this is true for both the matrix - theoretic and the graph - theoretic results .",
    "the following difficult question remains open : given an arbitrary set of functions , how do we choose the decomposition which will give us the sharpest results on injectivity ( assuming that such a choice exists ) ?    finally , the importance of cycle structure in sr and dsr graphs goes beyond questions of injectivity .",
    "cycle structure in sr graphs is , for example , linked closely to monotonicity @xcite ( several results in @xcite also have immediate graph - theoretic interpretations ) .",
    "the close relationship between cycle structure and the possibility of complex behaviour has been understood for some time for models whose structure can be represented via an interaction graph @xcite , but the corresponding results for general interaction networks represented via sr / dsr graphs ( or possibly other variants of these ideas ) are less complete .",
