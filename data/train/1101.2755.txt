    "neutrino oscillation experiments over the last twenty years have established a picture of neutrino mixing and masses that explains the results of solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "these experiments are consistent with the mixing of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 with three mass eigenstates , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in particular ,",
    "the mass differences are required to be @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "reactor experiments have played an important role in the establishment of this pattern . in experiments at distances",
    "@xmath4  m from the reactor core , at ill - grenoble , goesgen , rovno , krasnoyarsk , savannah river and bugey  @xcite , the measured rate of @xmath20 was found to be in reasonable agreement with that predicted from the reactor antineutrino spectra , though slightly lower than expected , with the measured / expected ratio at @xmath5 ( including recent revisions of the neutron mean lifetime ) . this opened the way to longer baseline experiments measuring the @xmath20 survival probability @xmath21 at various distances .    including the three known active neutrinos , @xmath21 can be written in first approximation as @xmath22l[{\\rm m}]}{e_{\\nuebar}[{\\rm mev}]}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and  @xmath24 if the baseline exceeds a few tens of kilometers , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 if it does not exceed a few kilometers  @xcite .",
    "the chooz experiment was located 1  km away from two 4.3  gw reactors  @xcite , and did not report any neutrino oscillation in the parameter region  @xmath27 . in addition chooz data",
    "provides the world s best constraint on the  @xmath11 mixing angle value , at @xmath28 ( 90%  c.l . ) for @xmath29 .",
    "forthcoming kilometer baseline experiments with multiple detectors are underway to provide a clean measurement of the last undetermined neutrino mixing angle  @xmath11  @xcite .    the kamland experiment detected electron antineutrinos from surrounding reactors located at an average distance of 180 km , thus probing the @xmath30 region .",
    "kamland successfully reported a strong oscillation signal in agreement with solar neutrino data  @xcite .",
    "a three - flavor oscillation treatment shows that kamland also has a weak sensitivity to the  @xmath11 mixing angle , as @xmath31 , leading to the anti - correlation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "recent global fits including solar neutrino and reactor oscillation data indicated a preference for non - zero @xmath11 at about @xmath34  @xcite .    in preparation for the double chooz reactor experiment , we have re - evaluated the specific reactor antineutrino flux ( @xmath7/fission ) , improving the electron to antineutrino data conversion  @xcite .",
    "the method relies on detailed knowledge of the decays of thousands of fission products , while the previous conversion procedure used a phenomenological model based on 30  effective beta branches .",
    "both methods are constrained by the well - measured ill spectrum of fission induced electrons that accompanies the antineutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the new calculation results in a small increase in the flux of  3.5% .",
    "although this increase has no significant effect on kamland s solar parameter results , when combined with the previously reported small deficits at nearer distances , it results in a larger average deficit of  5.7% , at @xmath6 .",
    "we call it the reactor antineutrino anomaly , significant at the level of 98.6%  c.l .",
    "this deficit is consistent with being independent from the distance to the reactor core at distances  @xmath35  meters , the distance of the bugey-3 experiment  @xcite .",
    "if this deficit is due to neutrino mixing , it could be explained by an energy - independent suppression of the @xmath20 flux at distances  @xmath35  meters .",
    "this requires a neutrino with a @xmath36  ev@xmath9 .",
    "the mixing amplitude with the @xmath12 must be @xmath37 .",
    "the required @xmath38 is significantly larger than those required by solar and atmospheric experiments .",
    "this suggests , if the neutrino mixing hypothesis is the correct explanation , the existence of a fourth neutrino , beyond the standard model .",
    "we would like to stress here that other explanations are also possible , such as a correlated artifact in the experiments , or an erroneous prediction of the antineutrino flux from nuclear reactor cores .",
    "we begin by discussing the use of new antineutrino spectra and provide a revised value of the predicted cross section per fission , in section  [ newsigmaf ] .",
    "we then revisit the short baseline oscillation results ( @xmath4  m ) and chooz in section [ sblexp ] , revealing a reactor antineutrino anomaly , which is discussed in section [ anomaly ] .",
    "the compatibility of our results with the existence of a fourth non - standard neutrino state is discussed in section [ newphysics ] .",
    "the chooz and kamland sensitivities to the @xmath11 mixing angle are revisited in sections [ chooz ] and [ kamland ] .",
    "their combination is discussed in section [ combined ] .",
    "two experimental programs for testing the anomaly are discussed in section [ testanomaly ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "fission reactors release about @xmath39 , which mainly come from the beta decays of the fission products of @xmath0u , @xmath3u , @xmath1pu , and @xmath2pu .",
    "the emitted antineutrino spectrum is then given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 refers to the contribution of the main fissile nuclei to the total number of fissions of the k@xmath42 branch , and @xmath43 to their corresponding neutrino spectrum per fission .",
    "for the last 25 years the @xmath44 spectra have been estimated from measurements of the total electron spectra associated with the beta decays of all fission products of @xmath0u , @xmath1pu , and @xmath2pu .",
    "thin target foils of these isotopes were irradiated with thermal neutrons at the ill reactor  @xcite .",
    "the measured spectra then had to be converted from electron to antineutrino spectra invoking a set of 30 effective beta - branches , adjusted to reproduce the total electron spectrum  @xcite .",
    "recently we revisited the conversion procedure with a novel mixed - approach combining the accurate reference of the ill electron spectra with the physical distribution of beta branches of all fission products provided by the nuclear databases  @xcite .",
    "this new approach provided a better handle on the systematic errors of the conversion .",
    "although it did not reduce the final error budget , it led to a systematic shift of about 3% in the normalization of @xmath0u , @xmath1pu , and @xmath2pu antineutrino fluxes , respectively .",
    "this normalization shift has been attributed to two main systematic effects in the original conversion of the ill electron data . at low energy ( @xmath45  mev )",
    "the implementation of coulomb and weak magnetism corrections to the fermi theory in the new approach turned out to deviate from the effective linear correction ( ) in  % ) used in the previous work . at high energy ( @xmath46  mev ) , the converted antineutrino spectra become very sensitive to the knowledge of the charge @xmath47 of the nuclei contributing to the total spectrum . in the previous approach , only the mean dependence of @xmath47 versus the end - point of the effective beta - branches had been used while in the new conversion we had access to the complete distribution , nucleus by nucleus .",
    "these two effects could be numerically studied and confirmed on various independent sets of beta - branches .",
    "because @xmath3u nuclei undergo fission with fast neutrons , the associated electron spectrum could not be measured in the thermal neutron flux of the ill reactor .",
    "therefore the _ ab initio _ summation of the @xmath44 from all possible beta decays of fission products was performed to predict the neutrino spectrum  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we provided a new prediction with an estimated relative uncertainty of the order of 15% in the 2 - 8  mev range .",
    "this uncertainty of _ ab initio _ calculations is still too large to be generalized to all isotopes but it is sufficiently accurate in the case of @xmath3u , which contributes to less than 10% of the total fission rate for all reactors considered in this work .",
    "an ongoing measurement at the frm ii reactor in garching will soon provide experimental constraints  @xcite .",
    "when predicting the antineutrino spectrum of a reactor @xmath48 , a weighted sum of the four antineutrino spectra @xmath49 is computed according to the considered fuel composition , which can be different in each experiment .",
    "the object of this article is to analyze the impact of the above - mentioned @xmath50  percent shift on past , present , and future experiments .",
    "generally reactor neutrino oscillation experiments search for the reaction : @xmath51 where an electron antineutrino interacts with a free proton in a detector , often filled with scintillator .",
    "the reaction cross section can be precisely computed with the  theory of weak interaction  @xcite : @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 being the momentum and energy of the positron , and the @xmath55 being the energy dependent recoil ( @xmath56 ) , weak magnetism ( @xmath57 ) , and radiative ( @xmath58 ) corrections . on the one hand",

    "@xcite , including outer radiative corrections . over the last 15  years the neutron mean",
    "lifetime has evolved , from 926  s ( value used in the ill experiment  @xcite ) to its current pdg average value of 885.7  s  @xcite . based on this parameterization",

    "it is worth mentioning that there is an ongoing controversy about the world average neutron lifetime , with ref .",
    "@xcite finding @xmath74  s , and making the world average ` suspect '",
    ". a lower value has also been found by the mambo-2 group  @xcite .",
    "the new world average should then evolve and settle to 881.4(1.4 )  s in  2011 ( ref .  @xcite and private communication from k.  schreckenbach ) .",
    "we note here that the average value of @xmath75 may depend on neutron lifetime measurements .",

    "the prediction of the cross section per fission is defined as : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the model dependent reactor neutrino spectrum for a given average fuel composition ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath83 is the theoretical cross section of reaction ( [ idb ] ) .",

    "largely explains the + 9.8% shift from the reference computations  @xcite .",
    "the new predicted cross section for any fuel composition can be computed from eq .",
    "( [ sigmaexp ] ) . by default",
    "our new computation takes into account the so - called off - equilibrium correction of the antineutrino fluxes ( increase in fluxes caused by the decay of long - lived fission products ) .",
    "in the eighties and nineties , experiments were performed at a few tens of meters from nuclear reactor cores at ill , goesgen , rovno , krasnoyarsk , bugey ( so called  3 and  4 ) and savannah river  @xcite . following these pioneering results middle- and long - baseline experiments",
    "were performed at chooz  @xcite and kamland  @xcite in the late nineties and after . in this section",
    "we revised each ratio of observed event rate to predicted rate .",

    "this experimental result was compared to the predicted cross section per fission , @xmath89 .    using ref .",
    "@xcite inputs , and the former converted neutrino spectra from  @xcite ( except for the @xmath3u neutrino spectrum taken from  @xcite ) , we get @xmath89=5.850  10@xmath88  cm@xmath9/fission , in good agreement with bugey-4 s estimation ( see table  [ tab : crosssec ] ) .",
    "we used the average fuel composition of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0u=53.8% , @xmath1pu=32.8% , pu@xmath2=5.6% and u@xmath3=7.8% , in fractions of fissions per isotope .",
    "we note here that the published bugey-4 cross section calculation does not account for the contribution of long - lived fission products ( off - equilibrium effects ) .",
    "the reference electron spectra used for the determination of @xmath82 were acquired after an irradiation time in the ill reactor flux of less than 1.5  day for all isotopes .",
    "but in the bugey experiments at a commercial pwr the irradiation time scale was typically about one year .",
    "@xmath82 should thus be corrected for the accumulation of long - lived fission products in the low energy part of the spectrum .",
    "we had to turn off these effects in our computation to recover the @xmath89  value .",
    "including these effects in our calculations would lead to a + 1.0% discrepancy .",
    "an over or under - estimation of the irradiation time by 100  days would lead to a systematic error on the off - equilibrium correction below 0.1% .",
    "computing the ratio of observed versus expected events , bugey-4 concluded that there was good agreement with the v - a theory of weak interactions , and that the neutrino flux emitted by pwr reactors is sufficiently understood to be computed using the parameters of  @xcite .",
    "applying the new reactor antineutrino spectra we obtain a new value of the cross section per fission of in units of 10@xmath88  cm@xmath9/fission .",
    "we thus revised the ratio  , which is now 2.0  standard deviations from the expectation without neutrino oscillations .",
    "this creates a tension between the measurement at bugey-4 and the new predicted cross section per fission . in the next sections we will see that the other reactor neutrino experimental results confirm this anomaly .",
    ".[tab : crosssec ] individual cross sections per fission per fissile isotope , @xmath84 .",
    "the slight differences in the ratios are caused by differences in off - equilibrium effects .",
    "results of the comparison of @xmath86 at bugey-4 in units of 10@xmath88  cm@xmath9/fission with the former and present prediction , @xmath90 , are shown . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for @xmath3u , since the spectrum is obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations , each bin is given an error ranging from  10% at low energy to  20% at high energy .",
    "however , if these errors are uncorrelated , the uncertainty on the overall neutrino rate and hence the cross - section per fission for @xmath3u is artificially low . to avoid this",
    ", we consider that there is a fully correlated  10% error on bins from  2 to 5.5  mev , another fully correlated 15% error on the block from  5.5 to 6.75  mev and another  20% fully correlated error on the last bins of the spectrum . with this conservative prescription",
    "our error on the @xmath3u cross - section per fission is  8.2% .",
    "finally we derive the total error , @xmath91 , on the antineutrino rate , for a given core composition .",
    "we account for the uncertainties on the cross section per fission per isotope , and the uncertainties on the averaged fraction of fission per isotopes . as an example we can consider the case of bugey-4 .",
    "the fuel composition is given in ref .",
    "the new values of the cross sections per fission per isotope as well as their uncertainties are given in table [ tab : crosssec ] .",
    "the @xmath41 coefficients are taken as correlated , following a typical fuel evolution curve , and such that @xmath92=1@xmath93 to account for the error on the thermal power of the nuclear core . in a first case",
    "we consider a  10% relative uncertainty on the fuel composition .",
    "we obtain a final error on the expected number of events of  2.7% .",
    "reducing the error on the fuel composition to  3.5% results in a final error of  2.4% .",
    "in this appendix we briefly provide details on our reanalysis of published data from gallex @xmath94cr source data @xcite , sage @xmath94cr  @xcite and @xmath95ar source data  @xcite , and miniboone neutrino data @xcite .",
    "the gallex collaboration performed two measurements with two @xmath94cr sources in  @xcite , obtaining the ratio of the measured and expected event rates .",
    "these data were recently reanalyzed  @xcite , providing updated values of the errors and the ratios .",
    "the sage collaboration performed a similar measurement with a @xmath94cr source , and more recently with a @xmath95ar source  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of these data in terms of neutrino oscillation was performed in  @xcite .",
    "the data values are @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . performing a neutrino oscillation search with these values yields contours very close to those of  @xcite .",
    "however we decided to include possible correlations between these four measurements in this present work , that were not previously taken into account .",
    "as the two gallex measurements used the same experimental technique , we decided to fully correlate their systematic errors , which we understand to be  5.6% and  7.4% respectively .",
    "the statistical errors remain of course uncorrelated . for sage",
    "we followed a similar procedure , with systematics of  5.7% and  7.0% according to  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath101 best fits obtained from reactor antineutrino rate results only ( @xmath102 ) and the gallium results only ( @xmath103 ) are slightly different , though with large uncertainties .",
    "we quantified this effect by using the prescription of ref .",
    "the corresponding @xmath104 valleys are displayed on the right panel of figure  [ f : gallval ] .",
    "after marginalizing over @xmath38 ( since fitted at the same value in both data sets ) the parameter goodness - of - fit between the two data sets on @xmath101 is  27.0% , indicating no significant tension between neutrino and antineutrino anomalies",
    ".    we also analyzed the miniboone neutrino data from  @xcite following the method outlined in  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to fit both electron - like and muon - like data at the same time .",
    "however , instead of searching for @xmath105 appearance , we search for @xmath106 disappearance , while allowing the global normalization of all the samples ( e - like and mu - like ) to fluctuate .    the excess of e - like data in the low energy part of the spectrum is well - fitted by the combined increase in overall normalization and by the disappearance of @xmath106 induced e - like events .",
    "we used a simplified version of the analysis in reference  @xcite , in that we used a covariance matrix independent from the normalization fitting parameter @xmath107 .",
    "we obtain very similar results , although our best fit point is in a slightly different location , at @xmath108 , @xmath109  ev@xmath9 and @xmath110 , as can be seen in figure  [ f : minib ] .",
