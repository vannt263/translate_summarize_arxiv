    "over the past decade , wide - field , deep astronomical surveys have provided an unprecedented statistical platform for studying the universe ( e.g. sloan digital sky survey , two micron all sky survey , 2df , ukirt infrared deep sky survey ) . for the lowest - mass and most populous stars in the milky way ( m dwarfs )",
    ", the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has yielded photometric samples that exceed 30 million stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and spectroscopic samples of over 40,000 m and l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "previous sdss studies have elucidated the mean properties of low - mass stars @xcite , their magnetic activity and flaring properties as a function of mass @xcite , as well as the structure and kinematics of the local milky way thin and thick disks @xcite and the low - mass initial mass and luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "m dwarfs have main sequence lifetimes that are considerably longer than the age of the universe and can be used to trace the evolution of both stellar properties and the milky way disks .",
    "@xcite showed that magnetic activity ( as traced by h@xmath0 ) in m dwarfs decreases with age and that m dwarfs appear to have finite activity lifetimes from @xmath71 - 2 gyr for early - type m dwarfs ( m0-m3 ) to @xmath77 - 8 gyr for later type stars ( m5-m7 ) .",
    "these results are important for the habitability of extrasolar planets orbiting m dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as active stars may disrupt planetary atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission does not have sufficient energy to significantly affect planetary systems but has been found to be correlate with x - ray emission @xcite , which can interact with extrasolar planet atmospheres .    while h@xmath0 is the most commonly studied emission line in m dwarfs , the higher - energy hydrogen balmer and ca ii transitions are also present in the optical spectra of active stars .",
    "the higher energy emission lines appear to trace different temperature regions in the chromosphere and can be used to characterize the upper atmospheres of active m dwarfs ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . however , lacking large samples of low - mass stars with spectroscopic coverage across the entire optical bandpass , it is still not clear how the various activity indicators trace each other in active m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "* hereafter w08 ) also showed that the ratio of cah / tio molecular indices ( a quantity that is likely related to metallicity ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) decreased with height in the galactic disk ( a proxy for age ) .",
    "this tantalizing result suggests that m dwarfs can be used to reconstruct the chemical evolution of the local milky way disk .",
    "however , the inability to assign accurate metallicities to individual m dwarfs limits a detailed exploration of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "several recent studies have made progress in calibrating the m dwarf metallicity scale .",
    "@xcite used infrared spectroscopy of m dwarfs in wide binaries with higher - mass stars to calibrate infrared spectral features with metallicity . in the optical",
    ", @xcite developed a metallicity - dependent quantity @xmath4 , which is a relation between the cah and tio molecular indices and defined as :    @xmath8_{z_{\\odot}}},\\ ] ]    where    @xmath9_{z_{\\odot}}= & -0.164(\\rm{cah2+cah3})^3 \\nonumber\\\\   & + 0.670(\\rm{cah2+cah3})^2 \\\\ & -0.118(\\rm{cah2+cah3})- 0.050.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using wide binaries consisting of an m dwarf and a higher mass star , @xcite showed that the @xmath4 index is a good discriminant between high and low - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = 0 and [ fe / h ] = -1 respectively ) for early - type m dwarfs ( @xmath7m0-m3 ) . while @xmath4 is a useful tool for examining the relative metallicity among stars , finer determinations of an absolute metallicity from @xmath4 will require additional calibration .    before the sdss @xcite , the largest spectroscopic samples of m dwarfs contained only a few thousand individual stars @xcite and were primarily focused on the red portion of the optical spectrum ( @xmath76000 - 8000  ) .",
    "the spectroscopic catalogs of m dwarfs from the first few sdss data releases quickly surpassed previous records for sample size @xcite and had spectral coverage that spanned the entire optical band ( @xmath73900 - 9300  ) at low resolution ( r@xmath71800 ) . w08 presented a spectroscopic catalog of more than 44,000 m dwarfs from the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) , more than doubling the m dwarf spectroscopic tally .",
    "due to the large number of spectra in the dr5 sample , spectral types were assigned using the hammerautomatic spectral typing facility @xcite . while the hammer spectral types are generally good to within @xmath101 sub  type , there have been recent indications that there may be systematic offsets for some of the m dwarf spectral types ( see section 2 ) .",
    "therefore , to ensure the highest quality sample , it is important to visually inspect each spectrum .",
    "there have been two subsequent sdss data releases since the w08 sample that include over 50,000",
    "additional m dwarf candidates and contain many sightlines at low galactic latitudes ( as part of the segue survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "the new lines of sight extend both the radial and vertical extent of the m dwarf sample , and provide a larger statistical platform from which to probe the structure , kinematics and evolution of the milky way using its smallest stellar constituents .    here",
    "we present the latest spectroscopic catalog of m dwarfs from data release 7 ( dr7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the sdss .",
    "while the main thrust of this paper is the presentation and characterization of a new spectroscopic sample , we have included a general magnetic activity analysis as well as a discussion about the future use of this sample to probe galactic chemical evolution .",
    "we describe our sample selection techniques in section 2 , specifically discussing our manual inspection of _ all _ m dwarf candidates .",
    "section 3 gives the mean properties of the sample , including a new activity analysis of the hydrogen balmer and ca ii k emission features .",
    "section 3 also contains a list of candidate m dwarfs within 25 pc and explores how the metallicity sensitive parameter @xmath4 varies as a function of stellar parameters .",
    "we discuss our results and future use of our new sample in section 4 .",
    "the sdss provides a large , uniform photometric and spectroscopic dataset from which to extract high - quality samples of low - mass dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we used the dr7 casjobs tool to select 116,161 m dwarf candidate objects with sdss spectra that 1 ) fell within the typical color range for m and l dwarfs ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; w08 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; 2 ) had sdss spectral classifications of `` star '' or `` star_late '' ; and 3 ) had radial velocities smaller than 1500 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "@xcite found that the color cuts used in previous studies did not extend blue enough ( @xmath14 in particular ) to include all of the m0 dwarfs .",
    "our new ( bluer ) color selection corrects for this previous oversight .",
    "the spectra for all 116,161 candidates were visually inspected and assigned spectral types using the hammer spectral typing facility @xcite .",
    "low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) spectra ( snr @xmath153 at @xmath78300  ) and extragalactic interlopers were removed during visual inspection , resulting in 109,639 objects .",
    "we also removed stellar spectra that were not identified as m dwarfs during visual inspection as well as those spectra that were duplicated in our sample ( including 6771 spectra for 2661 m dwarfs that were taken on different days ) and arrived at the 70,841 spectra of m dwarfs in our dr7 catalog . while many of the objects that we removed were k or l dwarfs , others were white dwarf ",
    "m dwarf ( wd - dm ) pairs and low - metallicity subdwarfs . all of the l dwarfs that were removed from our dr7 sample were cataloged and analyzed by @xcite .",
    "many of the other objects that were not included in our dr7 sample will be presented in future studies .",
    "not all of the wd - dm pairs were removed during the visual inspection .",
    "we used the color cuts from ( * ? ? ? * @xmath16 @xmath15 2 , @xmath5 @xmath17 0.3 , @xmath14 @xmath17 0.7 , @xmath18 ) to identify additional wd - dm pairs ( that avoided manual detection ) .",
    "all of the 497 objects that matched these color criteria are flagged as `` wdm '' in our dr7 catalog .",
    "we also defined a clean photometric sample using the sdss photometric processing flags ( saturated , peakcenter , notchecked , psf_flux_interp , interp_center , bad_counts_error were all set to zero in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 bands ) , which resulted in 65,277 m dwarfs . while our catalog contains all of the 70,84 visually inspected m dwarf spectra , the `` goodphot '' and `` wdm '' flags can be used to obtain samples that include good photometry and remove possible wd - dm pairs respectively .",
    "radial velocities ( rvs ) were measured by cross - correlating each spectrum with the appropriate @xcite m dwarf template .",
    "this method has been shown to produce uncertainties ranging from 7 - 10 kms@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "all of the dr7 objects were cross - matched to the usno - b / sdss proper motion catalog @xcite , identifying 39,151 m dwarfs with good proper motions 7 , sigra @xmath15 1000 , sigdec @xmath15 1000 and ( nfit = 6 or ( nfit = 5 and ( o @xmath15 2 or j @xmath15 2 ) ) ) @xcite . ] .",
    "distances to each star were calculated using the @xmath22 vs.  @xmath6 color - magnitude relation given in @xcite .",
    "our calculated distances have uncertainties of @xmath720% , arising mostly from the intrinsic spread of the main sequence .",
    "the proper motions and distances were combined with the rvs to produce 3-dimensional space motions for the dr7 m dwarfs . although we include the standard @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 space motions in our catalog , we caution that the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 velocities are in a cartesian coordinate system that may not be appropriate for stars at appreciable distances from the sun .",
    "we therefore also include the galactic radial ( @xmath26 ) , tangential ( @xmath27 ) and vertical ( @xmath28 ) cylindrical components of the position and velocity for each star for which we have 3d space motions .",
    "we also matched our catalog to the 2mass point source catalog @xcite , matching only to unique 2mass counterparts within 5@xmath29 of the sdss position that do not fall within the boundaries of an extended source ( gal_contam @xmath300 ) . to ensure that we used only high quality 2mass photometric data , we applied additional cuts to each of the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 bands .",
    "if the source was not detected ( rd_flg @xmath300 ) , nominally detected ( rd_flg @xmath306 ) , was detected but unresolved ( rd_flg @xmath309 ) , or had contaminated / confused photometry ( cc_flag @xmath340 ) in a particular band , the 2mass data were not included .",
    "this resulted in 57,956 2mass counterparts with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 magnitudes and their uncertainties that were included in the catalog .",
    "we used the 2mass photometry to investigate any possible m giant contamination .",
    "@xcite found that m giants and m dwarfs separate in @xmath35 vs. @xmath36 color space due to differences in h@xmath37o absorption in their atmospheres . by comparing the dr7 @xmath35 vs. @xmath36 color - color diagram with that of @xcite",
    ", we find that no more than 0.5% of our sample could be giants .",
    "in addition , @xcite conducted a complete magnitude - limited spectroscopic survey of a 1@xmath38 field in the sdss footprint and concluded that the giant contamination rate was less than 2% for stars redder than a spectral type of k5 .",
    "previous large spectroscopic samples of m dwarfs have relied on automated spectral typing due to the quantity of time required to manually inspect tens of thousands of candidate spectra .",
    "systematic discrepancies were recently identified in the spectral types from the w08 sdss sample that were determined automatically by the `` hammer '' spectral typing algorithm @xcite .",
    "the bias was detected as a systematic offset for late - type stars , whose automatic classification was often 1 subtype earlier than determined via visual inspection ( see figure [ hamdiff ] ) .",
    "we thus decided that visual inspection would produce the most reliable and precise spectroscopic sample .",
    "we visually inspected all 116,161 m dwarf candidates and manually assigned spectral types .",
    "the sample was divided among 17 individuals who used the manual `` eyecheck '' mode of the hammer ( v.  1_2_5 ) to assign spectral types and remove non - m dwarf interlopers .",
    "figure [ hamdiff ] shows the difference between the spectral types automatically determined by the hammer and the mean visual inspection . for early - type m dwarfs ( left panel ) , the hammer and the spectral typers agree most of the time . however , for @xmath738% of the late - type m dwarfs ( right panel ) , the hammer assigns spectral types 1 subtype earlier than the average human spectral typer .",
    "this confirms that while the hammer generates automatic spectral types within the quoted @xmath39 subtype accuracy @xcite , there is a systematic offset of 1 subtype for the late - type stars , and justifies our effort to manually inspect more than 116,000 candidates .",
    "each spectral typer also examined a control sample of 1000 spectra , of which 638 were m dwarfs .",
    "we used this control sample to assess the quality and reliability of the visually inspected sample by quantifying the variations among the 17 individual typers , and by comparing the median visual type for each star to its automatic hammer type .",
    "the results of the control sample show that there is excellent agreement between all of the spectral typers with a large fraction of the stars being assigned .",
    "almost all of the visual classifications in the control sample agreed to within @xmath101 subtype of the median value ; for most of the stars , the dispersion in visual classifications was @xmath40 subtypes . to ensure that there were no major systematics in the spectral types assigned by any individual , we examined the mean difference between each typer s visual classifications of the control sample spectra and the median classifications of the entire group .",
    "we divided the sample into the early types ( @xmath15 m5 ) and late types ( @xmath41 m5 ) to investigate any spectral type dependence in typing quality : all of the spectral typers clustered near the median values with no individual displaying a systematic offset larger than 0.2 subtypes .",
    "as part of our analysis we measured a number of spectral lines and molecular features in each m dwarf spectrum .",
    "all of the spectral measurements were made using the rv corrected spectra .",
    "the tio1 , tio2 , tio3 , tio4 , tio5 , tio8 , caoh , cah1 , cah2 , and cah3 molecular bandhead indices and their formal uncertainties were measured using the hammer with the molecular bandheads as defined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also measured the chromospheric hydrogen balmer and ca ii lines that are associated with magnetic activity .",
    "we expanded the h@xmath0 analysis of @xcite to include h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 and ca ii k ( h@xmath42 and ca ii h are blended in sdss data and were not included in our sample ) .",
    "all of the line measurements were made by integrating over the specific line region ( 8   wide centered on the line ) and subtracting off the mean flux calculated from two adjacent continuum regions ( continuum a and continuum b in table [ lines ] ) .",
    "equivalent widths ( ew ) were computed for each line by dividing the integrated line flux by the mean continuum value ( as in previous studies , we define the ew to be positive for emission lines ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the low - resolution of sdss spectra does not affect our ability to measure accurate line values , with the exception of caii k. due to the intrinsic caii k absorption present in m dwarf photospheres , weak activity appears as an emission peak in the absorption line .",
    "this weak emission can not be resolved in sdss spectra .",
    "however strong caii k emission overwhelms the absorption and can be easily recovered from low - resolution spectra @xcite . the lines and continuum regions ( in vacuum wavelengths ) can be found in table [ lines ] .",
    "formal uncertainties on the ews for each line were also computed .",

    "previously , this had been done solely for h@xmath0 .",
    "to be classified as active in a specific emission line , the following four criteria had to be satisfied : 1 ) the ew of the line was larger than some minimum value ( see below ) ; 2 ) the ew value must be 3 times the uncertainty ; 3 ) the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) in the continuum must be larger than 3 ; and 4 ) the height of the spectral line must be larger than 3 times the noise in the continuum .",
    "stars were classified as inactive if they met criterion # 3 and had no detectable emission .",
    "criterion # 3 preferentially selects brighter stars at any given color or spectral type .",
    "this selection bias should not have a large effect our results since we examine the properties of our sample in a galactic context and both active and inactive stars with low snr should be removed .",
    "however , if active stars are intrinsically more luminous than their inactive counterparts ( at the same color ; see section 3.2 below ) , criterion # 3 may serve to include slightly more active stars in our resulting analyses .    because the strength of the stellar continuum changes dramatically from caii k to h@xmath0 in m dwarfs , the ew thresholds used in criterion # 1 are different for each line .",
    "we experimentally derived the ew thresholds by automatically measuring activity in a subsample of 300 m dwarfs ( that spanned a range of snr and spectral types ) using 10 different ew activity thresholds .",
    "additionally , each spectrum was visually inspected and the activity state for all five emission lines was determined . by comparing the results of our manual inspection with the 10 different automatic routines , we determined the ew thresholds that most accurately reproduced our visual activity classifications .",
    "the ew activity threshold for each of the five emission lines can be found in table [ lines ] .",
    "we found that the previous h@xmath0 activity limit of 1   @xcite was slightly too high and excluded a number of good detections .",
    "we have therefore reduced the h@xmath0 ew activity criterion to 0.75  .    recently , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter k10 ) investigated the time variability of sdss m dwarfs and defined their h@xmath0 activity thresholds based on the median ew values that were detected at a 3@xmath43 confidence level as a function of spectral type .",
    "although the k10 threshold ews provide a robust way to select a clean sample , it unduly biases the sample toward the most active stars at later spectral types .",
    "for example , our dr7 catalog contains a large number of active m6 dwarfs ( that have h@xmath0 emission lines with peak values that are more than 5 times larger than the noise ) that have ews below the 3  threshold used in the k10 study .",
    "in addition , the activity fractions presented in k10 ( see their figure 4 ) include these active stars ( with ew @xmath15 3 ) in the `` inactive '' component of the activity fraction denominator .",
    "this explains why the activity fractions reported by k10 are smaller than previous determinations @xcite and indicates a serious selection bias in the k10 results .    for all of the active stars in the sample we computed the ratio of luminosity in the emission line as compared to the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath44/@xmath45 ) .",
    "we followed the methods of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who derived @xmath46 factors for the hydrogen balmer and ca ii chromospheric lines as a function of m dwarf spectral type .",
    "the @xmath46 factor uses empirical results for the bolometric luminosities of m dwarfs as a function of color and/or spectral type @xcite and relates the ew of a line to the fraction of the bolometric luminosity emitted by the line .",
    "the @xmath44/@xmath45 values were computed by multiplying the ew of each active star by the appropriate @xmath46 value .",
    "formal uncertainties were computed for each @xmath44/@xmath45 value and are included in the final database .",
    "we also computed the metal sensitive parameter @xmath4 , defined by @xcite , which uses a combination of the tio5 , cah2 , and cah3 molecular band indices to separate the sample into different metallicity classes ( see equations 1 & 2 ) .",
    "this is similar to the @xcite classification system but was re - calibrated using wide common proper motion pairs that were assumed to be at the same metallicity .",
    "stars with solar metallicity ( [ fe / h]=0 ) have @xmath4 values @xmath71 and stars with [ fe / h]=-1 have @xmath4 @xmath70.4 @xcite .",
    "although there is considerable scatter in the [ fe / h ] versus @xmath4 relation at high - metallicities , this parameter is very useful for finding and classifying low - metallicity stars that are likely members of the galactic halo .",
    "our catalog containing all of the measured quantities is publicly available on the vizier site or can be obtained by contacting the corresponding author .",
    "the individual spectra are available from the sdss dr7 website . as with previous sdss spectroscopic catalogs of low - mass stars ,",
    "we remind the community that these data do not represent a complete sample and that the complicated sdss spectral targeting ( see section 3.1 ) introduces a variety of selection effects .",
    "however , our new sample covers a large range of values for many of the physical attributes of the m dwarfs , including parameters that are sensitive to activity , metallicity , and galactic motion , making accurate activity , kinematic , and chemical analyses possible .",
    "in addition , because some of the derived quantities are computed by automatic routines , values for a small percentage ( @xmath74% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of individual stars may be incorrect ; this should not affect large statistical results .",

    "* w08 ) , but with much lower uncertainties due to the @xmath759,000 m dwarfs used to generate figure [ hafrac ] ( 7952 are h@xmath0 active and 51,034 are h@xmath0 inactive ) .",
    "there are a few small differences between figure [ hafrac ] and the h@xmath0 activity fractions reported by w08 that are likely due to the changes in some of the spectral types ( see above ) and the different galactic sightlines included in the dr7 sample .",
    "because of the lower snr in the blue portion of m dwarfs , fewer stars were available to measure activity for the higher order balmer and caii k emission lines .",
    "table [ activity ] gives the number of active and inactive stars for each emission line indicator that had the necessary quality for our activity analysis .",
    "as discussed in w08 , the activity fraction is highly dependent on the location of the samples in the galaxy . because m dwarfs have finite activity lifetimes and are dynamically heated in the galactic disk as they age , their activity state is correlated with position in the galaxy .",
    "one of the reasons that the m dwarfs in our sample have much smaller activity fractions than those studied nearby ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is that the sdss volume is much larger than those used in previous catalogs and is concentrated on the north galactic cap , yielding a much older stellar population .",
    "this is particularly clear for the early - type m dwarfs , which have median distances greater than 500 pc , and therefore ages that are considerably older than their short activity lifetimes ( @xmath7 1 - 2 gyr ) .",
    "we reiterate the warning from w08 that activity fractions in m dwarfs must be discussed in the proper galactic context .",
    "lccc    h@xmath0&7952&51034&0.13 + h@xmath1&2236&35144&0.06 + h@xmath2&1175&18816&0.06 + h@xmath3&528&14664&0.03 + caii k&620&9053&0.06 [ activity ]    the various emission lines measured in our spectra are formed at slightly different locations in the chromosphere , suggesting that the strength of one emission line may not necessarily predict the strength of another .",
    "we therefore examined how the various activity induced emission lines trace each other as a function of spectral type and absolute distance from the galactic plane ( a proxy for age ) .",
    "figure [ betafrac ] shows the h@xmath0 ( diamonds ) and h@xmath1 ( asterisks ) activity fractions for m2-m7 dwarfs as a function of galactic height .",
    "only the h@xmath0 activity fractions for stars that could have detected h@xmath1 emission are included .",
    "this limits the sample to the brighter stars at each spectral type that meet the snr criterion and does not include all of the m dwarfs that are sensitive to h@xmath0 emission .",
    "spectral types earlier than m2 and later than m7 were not included due to an insufficient sample size of active stars .",
    "as seen in previous studies , the magnetic activity fractions decrease as a function of galactic height , confirming an age - activity relationship ; stars closer to the plane are statistically younger and more likely to be active .",
    "figure [ betafrac ] also demonstrates that h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 trace each other extremely well for the entire dr7 sample , implying that the h@xmath1 activity lifetimes are essentially the same as those for h@xmath0 .",
    "the other activity tracers also appear to correlate with h@xmath0 emission .",
    "figure [ m4frac ] shows the activity fractions for all five emission lines in m4 dwarfs as a function of vertical distance from the galactic plane .",
    "each panel plots the activity fractions for stars where the data are good enough to measure ( i.e. are sensitive to ) h@xmath1 ( top left ) , h@xmath2 ( top right ) , h@xmath3 ( bottom left ) and caii k ( bottom right ) activity as well as the emission lines redder than that specific tracer .",
    "the activity fractions for all of the lines are in excellent agreement with each other and indicate that all five emission lines are produced for the same amount of time during the lifetime of an m dwarf .",
    "this new result is complementary to previous studies that found strong correlations among different emission line strengths in m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "although the relative emission line strengths for individual stars may fluctuate over time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mean values of the emission lines are well correlated in the large dr7 sample .",
    "the unprecedented size and galactic distribution of our spectroscopic sample confirms that not only the strength , but the duration of activity appears to be similar for all of the balmer and caii activity indicators .",
    "figure [ m4frac ] also demonstrates a possible ( and important ) selection effect present in magnitude - limited or activity - selected samples .",
    "a close examination of figure [ m4frac ] ( and figure [ betafrac ] ) reveals that the activity fractions are larger for the stars that are sensitive to the bluer emission lines .",
    "this trend was not expected since the stars used to compute the activity fraction were drawn from the same volumes in each of the four panels .",
    "the only difference was that the stars selected for the bluer emission line analyses were required to have higher snr . with this in mind",
    ", we can explain the different activity fractions as follows .",
    "the actual spread in absolute magnitude ( or luminosity ) at a given spectral type can be quite significant .",
    "some of this spread may be due to differences in the physical properties of the stars .",
    "@xcite showed that magnetically active stars are brighter in @xmath49 than their inactive counterparts .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) found that both active and higher metallicity m dwarfs ( many stars are both ) appear to be brighter in @xmath22 at a given color or spectral type .",
    "because the bluer emission lines that we are examining in figure [ m4frac ] require higher snr spectra to accurately measure activity , the m4 dwarfs at a given distance that meet the snr criterion are preferentially more luminous than other stars in the same distance bin . if activity is correlated with luminosity , our snr selection will bias our sample toward containing a higher fraction of active stars .",
    "in addition to activity fractions , we also investigated the median luminosity in each emission line as a function of spectral type .",
    "previous studies have investigated how the h@xmath0 luminosity changes as a function of spectral type @xcite .",
    "these studies found that the fraction of luminosity emitted in h@xmath0 is constant over the range m0-m5 and decreases by almost an order of magnitude for late - type m dwarfs .",
    "however , most of the previous studies concentrated on h@xmath0 and did not include similar analyses for the other balmer or caii lines , and those that did were based on a small sample of stars @xcite .",
    "each panel of figure [ lbol ] shows the median luminosity of a specific activity tracer ( as compared to the bolometric luminosity of the stars ) for active stars sensitive to that particular emission line .",
    "all of the activity tracers exhibit similar behavior , with the relative luminosity staying constant for the early - type m dwarfs and then falling to lower values at or around a spectral type of m5 . the median values and the upper and lower quartiles that are plotted in figure [ lbol ] are also given in table [ tab : lbol ] .",
    "the bluer emission lines produce smaller fractional luminosities as expected , and are consistent with previous balmer decrement studies @xcite .",

    "regardless , this strong trend in metallicity demonstrates the utility of large spectroscopic samples of m dwarfs ( such as the one presented in this paper ) for understanding the chemical evolution of the milky way . however , additional calibration is required to convert quantities such as @xmath4 into precise metallicities .",
