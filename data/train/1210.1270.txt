    "in 1987 anderson @xcite suggested the strange behavior of cuprate materials between the superconducting dome and the magnetically ordered insulating phase could be described by a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state in which preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped .",
    "just one year later appeared the first effective model in which the magnetic degrees of freedom are disregarded in favor of the more pertinent singlet degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this is nothing but the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) .",
    "however , it was soon realized@xcite that the groundstate of the undoped @xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice exhibits a long - range nel order in contrast to the initial expectation based on the rvb picture .",
    "furthermore , the qdm on a square lattice was also found to have only gapped crystalline phases but no evidence of an rvb spin liquid phase in a finite region of the phase diagram.@xcite it is still possible to argue that , even though the undoped antiferromagnet has the nel order , the rvb picture gives a better theoretical starting point once the system is doped with holes .",
    "however , it would be natural to ask if the rvb spin liquid phase can be realized in undoped magnetic system with only short - range interaction .",
    "one may expect that magnetic frustration would favor rvb state over the nel phase .",
    "thus , over the time , the main interest in qdm was shifted from the original motivation of the application to high @xmath2 superconductivity , to the effects of frustration .",
    "however , clear confirmation of a rvb phase remained elusive for a rather long time .",
    "a breakthrough in the study of qdm was due to moessner and sondhi @xcite who showed that a simple qdm defined in the triangular lattice exhibit a disordered phase which , recalling that these dimer models are supposed to be effective models for frustrated magnets , can be considered as an explicit example of the rvb spin liquid phase .",
    "it was also recognized that , the rvb spin liquid phase is a topologically ordered phase with a nontrivial topological degeneracy of the groundstates.@xcite in fact , the rvb spin liquid phase is essentially identical to the @xmath3 topological phase which was introduced in a completely different context of quantum information processing.@xcite the qdm is generally not exactly eqivalent to an antiferromagnetic hamiltonian defined in terms of quantum spins",
    ". however , the projection from a magnetic system to a qdm was performed successfully in heisenberg antiferromagnets on frustrated lattice , such as the square lattice with strong enough second and/or third neighbors couplings or the kagome lattice .",
    "these suggest that the qdm may well represent phases without magnetic order in antiferromagnets .",
    "in fact , very recently , frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets on kagome and other lattices are reported to be in the rvb spin liquid phase ( @xmath3 topological phase ) by several authors.@xcite    now that the existence of the rvb spin liquid phase appears to be confirmed in qdms as well as in antiferromagnets , the issue of superconductivity in doped spin liquids becomes a more pressing question .",
    "this isssue started in fact to be investigated shortly after the apearence of qdm @xcite doping of an rvb spin liquid is expected to induce a novel type of elementary excitations called holon .",
    "a holon , carrying electric charge @xmath0 but no spin , appears as a result of fractionalization , namely deconfinement of fractionalized excitations .",
    "indeed , topological degeneracy of the undoped rvb spin liquid is known to be intimately connected to the fractionalization phenomenon@xcite .    superconductivity may be realized if the holons condense .",
    "at least naively , one may expect that the resulting superconductor is an exotic one due to condensation of charge-@xmath0 holons , instead of usual charge-@xmath4 cooper pairs .",
    "a fundamental issue in this problem is the statistics of the holon . for the holons to condense without forming pairs",
    ", they must be bosons .",
    "however , it should be noted that transmutation of the statistics@xcite is possible .",
    "namely , the statistics of holons as elementary excitations appearing in the low - energy limit can be different from the statistics assigned to holons in the microscopic model .    in this paper",
    "we address the issue of the statistics of holes and its interplay with possible superconducting phases in doped qdms . in a recent work@xcite",
    "it was shown that a qdm with fermionic ( at microscopic level ) holes is equivalent to another qdm with bosonic holes .",
    "because of the equivalence , the statistics of the holon as a physical elementary excitation must be the same for either representation .",
    "this proves the existence of a dynamical statistical transmutation in the system . in this paper",
    "we study in more details the statistical transmutation in qdm and give a simple and efficient method to obtain the relation between the qdms with fermionic and bosonic representation of the holes .    in section  [ sec.gauge ]",
    "we introduce a second quantization notation for qdm hamiltonians and show the gauge symmetry associated with them .",
    "in section  [ sec.composite ] we present the composite particle representation of qdm hamiltonians which is the key ingredient to show the exact equivalence between a qdm with bosonic and another qdm with fermionic holes .",
    "this equivalence is shown for a generic flipping term defined in any kind of lattices .",
    "the result , which relies in an orientation prescription of the bonds in the lattice considered , is totally generic and can then be applied to any qdm defined in the most common lattices .",
    "it is important to stress that the method used here differs considerably with the one used in ref .   where a two - dimensional version of the jordan - wigner ( jw ) transformation was used .",
    "as we explain in the conclusion , it is important to point out the numerous advantages of this new representation compared to the jw transformation . in section  [ sec.classification ]",
    "we argue how the modification of the orientation prescription can be interpreted as a simple gauge transformation in the qdm hamiltonian .",
    "we then apply the general result of the statistical transmutation obtained in section  [ sec.composite ] to generic qdm hamiltonians defined on the square , triangular , hexagonal and kagome lattices .",
    "section  [ sec.numerical ] is devoted to numerical investigation of four inequivalent qdm defined on the triangular lattice .",
    "in particular , we identify an exotic superconductor phase due to condensation of holons with charge @xmath0 , measuring the gauge - invariant green s function of a single holon . in section  [ sec.bh ]",
    "we discuss an explicit realization of one of the qdm discussed in section  [ sec.numerical ] .",
    "it is obtained as a low energy strong interaction limit of a bose - hubbard model on the kagome lattice . the number of bosons is directly related to the doping , or number of holes , in the resulting qdm on the triangular lattice .",
    "section  [ sec.conclusions ] is devoted to the discussion of our results .",
    "we also include as an appendix the derivation of the statistical transmutation for a generic qdm on the kagome lattice using the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "of course the result is consistent with the one obtained with the composite particle representation obtained in section  [ sec.composite ] , but allows a better understanding of the connection between these two different methods .",
    "we start with a doped quantum dimer model on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "to fix the ideas , we work here with the hamiltonian defined on the square lattice but all the arguments remain valid for any two dimensional lattice .",
    "we write the hamiltonian as h = h_j+h_v+h_t [ eq : h1 ] with h_j&=&-j _ + h_v&=&v",
    "_ + h_t&=&-t_\\ { ||+ || . + & + & .",
    "||+ ||+ } , where the sums are over all the smallest resonant plaquettes on the lattice ( for the square lattice these are the squares ) . in a second quantized formalism",
    "we assume that dimer configurations are created by spatially symmetric dimer operators @xmath5 and holes are created by bosonic operators @xmath6 .",
    "then , we can re - write the hamiltonian as : h_j&=&-j_\\ { b^_i , jb^_k , l b_j , kb_l , i+ } + h_v&=&v_\\ { b^_i , jb^_k , l b_i , jb_k , l + b^_j , kb^_l , i b_j , kb_l , i } + h_t&=&-t_i\\ { b^_i , jb_j , k a^_ka_i + } . [ hoping_t ] in the last equation , the indices correspond to the labeling of the sites of a square plaquette as in figure [ fig : index ] . in our previous conventions ,",
    "dimer configurations are represented by spatially symmetric operators @xmath5 satisfying : [ eq : commut_b ] & = & _ i , k_j , l+_i , l_j , k + & = & = 0 .",
    "the boson operator @xmath7 creates a hole in the site @xmath8 and satisfies [ eq : commut_a ] & = & _ i , j + & = & = 0 .",
    "the operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 commutes one with each other [ eq : commut_ab ] = = = 0 .",
    "we introduce in the model a constraint on the number of dimers and holes which warrants that at each site of the lattice there is either one and only one hole or one and only one dimer arriving to it : [ eq : constraint ] a^_ia_i+_z=_1,_2b^_i , i+zb_i , i+z=1 .",
    "of course this constraint implies , among others , that the holes have to be considered as hard core bosons .",
    "it is important to notice that the hamiltonian has the following @xmath11 gauge symmetry : [ eq : gauge1 ] a_j & & e^i_ja_j + [ re : gauge2 ] b_j , k & & e^i(_j+_k)b_j , k where @xmath12 is an angle .",
    "this invariance can be exploited to prove the statistical transmutation symmetry in some two dimensional systems by means a jordan - wigner transformation on the holon operators@xcite . in the following",
    "we present an alternative description for the doped qdm using composite operators which allows us to understand in a different way the equivalence between a model with bosonic holes and one with fermionic holes . for doing this , we have first to make a choice of a given orientation prescription for the bonds in the lattice .",

    "in order to prove the equivalence between a qdm hamiltonian with bosonic holes and another hamiltonian with fermionic holes , we propose a different formulation for the qdm . this formulation is done in terms of composite particles by defining the operator b_i , j = b_i , ja^_ia^_j .",

    "in which a matter field is coupled to a gauge field .",
    "more importantly , one can check that _ within the subspace _",
    "@xmath14 , the set of operators @xmath21 form a closed algebra similar to the one of @xmath22 . the hamiltonian can entirely be written in terms of these @xmath20 operators making its gauge invariance a trivial statement .",
    "its precise form is given by @xmath23 with : h_j&=&-j_\\ { b^_i , jb^_k , l b_j , kb_l , i+ } + h_v&=&v_\\ { b^_i , jb^_k , l b_i , jb_k , l + b^_j , kb^_l , i b_j , kb_l , i } + h_t&=&-t_i\\ { b^_i , jb_j , k + } it is evident that , within this formulation , the basic building blocks of the model are created by @xmath24 which corresponds to composite particles of charge @xmath4 .",
    "namely , the model is completely defined in terms of the constituent particle with charge @xmath4 .",
    "this has several important consequences .",
    "in particular , the gauge invariance requires that the energy spectrum of the system on a torus , as a function of the magnetic flux @xmath25 through the `` hole '' of the torus , is invariant under @xmath26 .",
    "( for early discussions on the @xmath27-flux periodicity in the qdms , see refs .   and references therein .",
    ") this periodicity corresponds to the unit flux quantum for charge @xmath4 objects .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the physical elementary excitations of the system have minimum charge @xmath4.@xcite the system can have a topological order which leads to _ fractionalization _ ; elementary excitations can have fractions of the charge @xmath4 of the constituent particle of the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "if the charge-@xmath0 holons are deconfined as a result of fractionalization , they could condense to form an exotic superconductor .    the apparent contradiction between the periodicity of the energy spectrum in @xmath27 flux and the expected flux quantization in the unit of @xmath28 in the condensate of charge-@xmath0 holons",
    "is resolved by the existence of the topological vortex excitation called vison .",
    "insertion of the @xmath27 flux corresponds to trapping of a vison .",
    "although the flux periodicity of the groundstate energy does not distinguish an exotic charge-@xmath0 condensate from the usual superconductor , an experimental detection scheme of the charge-@xmath0 condensation , based on a `` vortex memory effect '' , was proposed.@xcite an actual experiment@xcite on the high-@xmath2 superconductor did not find such a signature of charge-@xmath0 condensation .",
    "nevertheless , the exotic supercondutivity due to condensation of charge-@xmath0 objects is possible in principle , and is an interesting subject to pursue theoretically and experimentally . later in this paper",
    ", we will introduce a quantity which detects a charge-@xmath0 condensation , and study it numerically in several qdms .",
    "the main advantage of the formulation in terms of composite operators presented above is that one can prove an equivalence between a hamiltonian where holes are hard core bosons and another one where the holes are fermions .",
    "let us consider a qdm hamiltonian with bosonic holes , where their creation and annihilation operators @xmath7 and @xmath29 satisfy bosonic commutation relations .",
    "let us also consider another qdm hamiltonian with fermionic holes , created and annihilated by the set of operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 which now satisfy fermionic anti - commutation relations .",
    "we then build the respective composite operators : b_i , j&=&b_i , ja^_ia^_j + _ i , j&=&b_i , jf^_if^_j as for the operators @xmath32 , all quantities in the rest of the paper with a tilde correspond to operators and coupling constants of the _ fermionic _ representation for the holes . before proceeding , there is an important statement to make .",
    "again , one can show that within the subspace @xmath14 , both set of operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 form the _ same _ closed algebra of _ bosonic _ dimer operators .",
    "another important point is that the definition of the composite operators in terms of fermions is more subtle because it is necessary to take a prescription for the orientation of the dimers ( which determines the order of the fermions in the endpoints of each dimer ) .    in the following",
    "we will call _ `` even prescription '' _ of a given plaquette an ordering prescription for the bonds such that all the bonds are oriented in a clockwise direction or an even number of bonds are oriented anti - clockwise . by contrast",
    "we call _ `` odd prescription '' _ the prescriptions obtained from the clockwise ordering by flipping an odd number of bonds .",
    "notice that , since the resonance plaquettes containing @xmath35 dimers have necessary @xmath36 bonds , the anti - clockwise prescription(where all bonds are oriented anti - clockwise ) is always an _ even prescription_.

    "in other words , the resonance term of dimers in the plaquette is invariant under a simultaneous change of `` statistics '' of the holes in the system ( i.e. bosonic into fermionic or vice - versa ) and the sign of the dimer resonance loop amplitude @xmath38 .",

    "then , finally we have that changing the statistics of holons together with the sign of all the kinetic amplitudes we obtain a completely equivalent hamiltonian .    by using the j - w transformation we can recover the equivalences presented in previous section , but the procedure is more laborious .",
    "we have pointed that starting from different prescriptions for the bonds we can prove different equivalences . a change",
    "i the lattice prescription used in the composite operator representation is equivalent to a gauge transformation on on the dimers .",
    "one last very important point concerns the issue of boundary conditions within the j - w approach .",
    "the composite operator approach which we have extensively used in the paper is valid independently of the boundary conditions used for the system .",
    "in contrast , the j - w approach is valid only for infinite systems or finite systems with open boundary conditions .",
    "let us come back to equation ( [ eq : jordan_wigner ] ) assuming that the bosonic @xmath9 operators are well defined in a system in periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this means that for example the operators @xmath80 and @xmath81 are forced to be the same if sites @xmath8 and @xmath82 correspond to the same point in the system because of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , because of the very nature of the non - local j - w transformation , the relation between the operators @xmath83 and @xmath84 must contain a twist .",
    "in the one - dimensional version of the j - w transformation , it is easy to see that this twist is a sign which depends only on the total number of particles in the system . then , in one dimension , if one restricts to the subspace of a fixed number of particles it is possible to implement consistent way periodic boundary conditions . here in two dimensions ,",
    "the twist one should force for the fermionic operators depends not only on the number of particles but also on their relative positions with respect to the points @xmath8 and @xmath82 .",
    "that means that , even restricting to a fixed number of particles , starting from periodic boundary conditions for the bosons operators , it is not possible to implement boundary conditions for the fermionic operators which are consistent with all the possible particle configurations .",
