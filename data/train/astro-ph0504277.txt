    "the origin of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) is a long standing subject of debate .",
    "these galaxies are gas poor or completely devoid of gas and are the faintest galaxies known .",
    "objects matching the definition of dsphs are found both in galaxy clusters and in groups , but it is certainly the local group the place where dsphs have been better studied thanks to their proximity .",
    "1truecm = 14truecm    two main formation paths have been proposed explain their origin , nature of nurture . in one scenario",
    "these faint galaxies could be the result of cosmic reionization and stellar feedback quenching gas accretion and star formation in low mass haloes ( dekel & silk 1986 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ; bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2000 ; ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ; benson et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b ; somerville 2002 ; susa & umemura 2004 ) . however , there is no obvious signature of reionization in the star formation history of these galaxies ( grebel & gallagher 2004 ) , which in many cases continued to form stars over more than 10 gyr , and for some dsphs the most recent inferred halo masses are likely too large ( @xmath4 , see kleyna et al .",
    "2002 ; wilkinson et al .",
    "2004;kazantzidis et al . 2004 ) for supernovae winds to remove most of the baryons ( mori , ferrara & madau 2002 ; mayer & moore 2004 ; read & gilmore 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , these models do not naturally explain why dsphs share some structural similarities with equally faint but gas - rich , much younger disk - like galaxies , dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) , notably their exponential light distribution .",
    "furthermore they do not give rise to the morphology - density relation observed in groups and clusters , namely the fact that dsphs tend to be concentrated towards the central galaxies while dirrs are found at much larger distances , nor they explain the dichotomy between dominance of rotation for the stars of most dirrs and dominance of pressure support for those of dsphs .",
    "various environmental effects have been scrutinized to explain similarities and differences between the two types of galaxies postulating that dsphs are somehow transformed dirrs .",
    "ram pressure stripping of gas from dwarf irregular - like progenitors caused by a hot diffuse gaseous corona surrounding the milky way has been proposed as a way to explain the low gas contents of dsphs together with the similar stellar light distributions of the two types of dwarfs ( einasto et al . 1974",
    "; faber & lin 1983 ; grebel , gallagher & harbeck 2003 ) , and has also been considered as the origin of hi clouds possibly associated with some dsphs and transitional dirrs / dsphs like phoenix ( blitz & robishaw 2000 ; gallart et al . 2001 ) .",
    "van der bergh ( 1996 ) has argued that the correlation between galactocentric distance and gas content in dsphs is a signature of ram pressure stripping .",
    "tidal stripping of dwarf irregulars has also been considered as an alternative way of removing gas from the dwarfs ( e.g. ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "recently , high resolution n - body / sph simulations were used to show that tides do not only remove gas and stars but can also reshape the stellar components of a dwarf disky galaxy resembling a dwarf irregular ( mayer et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "this `` tidal stirring '' can turn a rotationally supported disk into a pressure supported spheroidal stellar system by means of bar formation and a subsequent buckling instability .",
    "the mechanism is particularly effective for satellites of massive galaxies that are strongly tidally shocked owing to the plunging orbits expected in cdm models and works for systems having a variety of dark halo profiles , including cuspy profiles ( mayer et al .",
    "the transformation is not necessarily associated with intense tidal mass loss ; indeed , objects with very high - mass - to light ratios , thus embedded in dense , massive dark halos , can still be reshaped from the instabilities induced by tidal shocks albeit losing minimal mass ( mayer et al .",
    "2001b ) .    a problem of this model ,",
    "however , is that tides can not remove completely the gas from the disky progenitors of dsphs ; the low gas fractions of dsphs can be explained by only invoking rapid consumption from star formation of the remaining gas in a series of tidally triggered bursts associated with bar - driven gas inflows ( mayer et al .",
    "however , although intermittent star formation is observed in some dsphs ( gallart et al . 1999 ; hernandez , gilmore & valls - gabaud 2000 ) , the star formation rates needed to completely consume the gas are well in excess of those implied by reconstructions of the star formation histories of dsphs using detailed color - magnitude diagrams ( mayer et al .",
    "moreover , draco and a few other dsphs do not show extended star formation histories , instead seem to have ceased star formation about 10 gyr ago ( grebel et al . 2004 ) .",
    "1.3truecm = 14truecm    it is likely that both gravitational tides and hydrodynamical processes play a role ( gavazzi et al .",
    "for example , ram pressure could act simultaneously with tides and increase the efficiency of gas removal ( mayer & wadsley 2003 ) .",
    "recent 2d and 3d grid - based hydrodynamical simulations of ram pressure stripping of disk - like dwarfs in poor groups show that ram pressure alone can remove most of the gas in dwarf galaxies with halo circular velocities lower than @xmath5 km / s ( marcolini , brighenti & dercole 2003 ) . however , these and other simulations ( mori & burkert 2000 ) do not use models of dwarf galaxies directly based on the @xmath0 cdm model and do not include the effect of tides . the effectiveness of both ram pressure and tidal stirring will also depend on the orbital history of the dwarfs , and this is where the cosmological framework comes into play .",
    "for example dwarfs that fell into the primary halo at very high redshift likely had orbits with smaller pericenters relative to those falling later on ( mayer et al .",
    "2001b ) , thus suffering stronger tidal shocks , and possibly also stronger ram pressure in a denser gaseous corona , while being exposed to the effect of the cosmic uv background ( bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2000 ; somerville 2002 ; barkana & loeb 1999 ; shaviv & dekel 2003 ) .",
    "indeed cosmological simulations of galaxy formation incorporate all such mechanisms but their resolution is still too coarse to allow a study of their effects at the scale of the tiny dwarf spheroidals ( governato et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in this paper we will study for the first time the combined effects of ram pressure and tidal stirring using high resolution three dimensional n - body+sph simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting within the milky way dark halo and gaseous corona .",
    "we will use galaxy models and orbits consistent with the predictions of @xmath0cdm simulations .",
    "the simulations include also radiative cooling as well as heating and ionization from the cosmic uv background radiation .",
    "the main goal of the present work will be to establish whether these two mechanisms can explain the present - day low gas content of dsphs if these galaxies are the descendants of gas - rich dwarfs with structure similar to today s dirrs .    lcccccccccc model & @xmath6 & @xmath7 & @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & physics & run & @xmath11 & @xmath12 +   + v60c4 & 62 & 4 & 2.2 & 250 & 50 & ad & rc4aad & 450 & 55 & + v60c4 & 62 & 4 & 2.2 & 250 & 50 & ad & rc4aadhr & 450 & 60 & + v60c4 & 62 & 4 & 2.2 & 250 & 50 & rc & rc4archr & 450 & 380 & + v60c4 & 62 & 4 & 2.2 & 250 & 50 & rcuv & rc4arcuv & 450 & 290 & + v28c4 & 25 & 4 & 1.1 & 250 & 50 & td(ad ) & rc4btd & 45 & 20 & + v28c4 & 25 & 4 & 1.1 & 250 & 50 & ad & rc4bad & 45 & 0 & + v28c4 & 25 & 4 & 1.1 & 250 & 50 & rc & rc4brc & 45 & 9.5 & + v28c4 & 25 & 4 & 1.1 & 150 & 30 & rc & rc4crc & 45 & 0 & + v40c20 & 42 & 20 & 0.5 & 150 & 30 & td(ad ) & rc20td & 46.5 & 22.2 & + v40c20 & 42 & 20 & 0.5 & 150 & 30 & ad & rc20ad & 46.5 & 0 & + v40c20 & 42 & 20 & 0.5 & 150 & 30 & rc & rc20rc & 46.5 & 3.55 + v40c20 & 42 & 20 & 0.5 & 150 & 30 & rcuv & rc20rcuv & 46.5 & 0.65 + v40c20 & 42 & 20 & 0.5 & 250 & 50 & ad & rc20bad & 46.5 & 0 & + v40c20 & 42 & 20 & 0.5 & 250 & 50 & rc & rc20brc & 46.5 & 10 & +",

    "halo virial parameters ( mass , radius , circular velocity ) are consistent with the lcdm model .",
    "although we believe that the milky way halo has a virial velocity @xmath13 km / s ( klypin , zhao & somerville 2002 ) we use a slightly larger value , @xmath14 km / s , in order to have @xmath15 km / s at about 10 kpc from the center without including a disk component .",
    "we choose a concentration @xmath16 for the mw halo , this being typical for lcdm halos at a scale of @xmath17 ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) . with our choice of parameters",
    "the shape of the rotation curve is quite flat out to @xmath18 kpc and the resulting halo mass within @xmath18 kpc is @xmath19 , consistent with the orbital dynamics of the magellanic clouds and distant dsphs ( lin , jones & klemola 1995 ; dehnen & binney 1998 ) .",
    "overall our halo model resembles model a3 in klypin , zhao & somerville ( 2002 ) , which matches simultaneously most of the known observational constraints within the framework of the lcdm model .",
    "the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium within the halo potential and its temperature is @xmath20 k at 50 kpc , consistent with ovi , ovii and x - ray absorption measurements in the galactic halo ( sembach et al.2003 ) .",
    "assuming an isotropic model , the halo temperature at a given radius @xmath21 is determined by the cumulative mass distribution @xmath22 of the dark , stellar and gaseous components of the mw beyond @xmath21 and by the density profile @xmath23 of the hot gas : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the proton mass , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the gravitational and boltzmann constants .",

    "where the dwarf galaxies that we have simulated spend most of the time while orbiting within the primary halo ( see below ) , the hot halo density is @xmath31 atoms/@xmath29 .",
    "such a hot diffuse halo is also a natural expectation of the current lcdm paradigm of structure formation ( white & frenk 1991 ; governato et al .",
    "2004 ; sommer - larsen , portinari & goetz 2003 ; maller & bullock 2004 ) .",
    "the multi - component dwarf galaxy models are built using the technique developed by hernquist ( 1993 ) and later refined by springel & white ( 1999 ) ( for further details on the modeling see also mayer et al .",
    "they comprise an exponential disk of gas and stars embedded in an nfw halo .",
    "we used three dwarf models with @xmath6 @xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 km / s km / s and concentration @xmath35 ( the first two models ) and @xmath36 ( the third model ) .",
    "the choice of halo concentration can be quite flexible since cosmological simulations show a large scatter of such property at small mass scales , mostly due to a large spread in halo formation times ( bullock et al .",
    "the rotation curves of the models are reported in figure 1 ; while the rotation curves of models v60c4 and v30c4 are slowly rising in agreement with those of todays dwarf irregulars , that of model v40c20 rises quite steeply owing to the much higher halo concentration .",
    "a steep rotation curve is a more appropriate choice for the progenitors of draco or ursa minor that have very high central dark matter densities ( see mayer et al . 2001b ; hogan & dalcanton 2000 ) .",
    "lokas ( 2002 ) and kazantzidis et al . (",
    "2004 ) have shown that dsphs kinematics suggests they are embedded in halos with @xmath37 km / s .",
    "we used even larger values of @xmath6 in our initial conditions since these can later decrease as a result of tidal mass loss , by roughly a factor of 2 according to the recent cosmological simulations by kravtsov , gnedin & klypin ( 2004 ) .",
    "1.3truecm = 14truecm    the galaxy models have disks of mass @xmath38 of the total mass , lower than the universal baryon fraction but quite typical for present - day lsb or dirr galaxies ( jimenez et al .",
    "2003 ) . following , mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) , the exponential scale length @xmath39 of the disk is determined by the spin parameter and concentration @xmath7 of the halo",
    "; we use @xmath40 for models rc4a and rc4b , and @xmath41 for model rc20a , b ( the mean spin of cosmological halos is @xmath42 , see e.g. gardner 2001 , and 20% of halos have spins as high as @xmath43 due to the log - normal shape of the probability distribution of halo spins ) .",
    "the disk sizes in models v28c4 and v40c20 are the same ( the higher spin parameter compensates for the higher halo concentration ) and , since also the disk mass is the same by choice , we can isolate the role of halo concentration ( or , equivalently , @xmath6 ) by comparing the two models .",
    "note that all the models have a central surface brightness of @xmath44 mag arcsec @xmath45 in the b band for a stellar - mass - to light ratio of 2 , typical of dirrs and dwarf spirals ( see de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "galaxies with these low disk mass fractions are stable to bar formation in isolation irrespective on halo concentration ( mayer & wadsley 2004 ) .",
    "however they can become bar unstable when tidally perturbed by a much more massive halo .",
    "we use @xmath46 particles for the dark halos of the dwarfs and @xmath47 particles for both the stellar and the gaseous disk of the dwarf .",
    "the milky way halo is modeled with @xmath48 dark matter particles , while @xmath49 particles are used for the superimposed gaseous halo ( the mass of hot halo particles is @xmath50 ) .",
    "each simulation has a total of @xmath51 particles , which makes them quite computationally demanding .",
    "two runs employing model v60c4 were repeated with increased resolution in the disk of the dwarf , ( @xmath52 particles for both its stellar and its gaseous component , see table 1 ) .",
    "the choice of putting a large fraction of the total number of particles in the primary halo is motivated by the desire of minimizing spurious two - body heating between halo particles and those of the disks of the dwarfs ( moore , katz & lake 1996 ; mayer 2004 ) .",
    "we use a fairly large gravitational softening for the gas and dark matter particles in the primary system , @xmath53 kpc to minimize discreteness noise in the potential . for the dwarf models instead , the softening is @xmath54 for halo particles and @xmath55 for star and gas particles , where @xmath39 is the disk scale length ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the dwarf galaxy satellites are placed on bound eccentric orbits in the primary halo . in mayer",
    "et al . ( 2001b ) we explored a wide range of orbital eccentricities and initial disk inclinations . tidally induced transformation was found to be essentially independent on disk inclination ( with only purely retrograde encounters versus purely prograde encounters showing significant differences ) .",
    "we also found that the orbital time , and not the orbital eccentricity , is the most sensitive orbital parameter for causing the transformation since it determines both the strength and number of tidal shocks .",
    "here we choose orbits with an apocenter to pericenter ratio of 5 , corresponding to the mean value for satellites in cosmological simulations ( ghigna et al .",
    "1998 , gill et al . 2004 ) , and we consider apocenters of 250 or 150 kpc ( the pericenter being 50 or 30 kpc ) corresponding to orbital times of , respectively , 3.2 and 1.3 gyr .",
    "the dwarf galaxies start at apocenter and are evolved for 3 to 5 orbits with their disks initially inclined 60 degrees with respect to their orbital plane .",

    "we use a standard cooling function for a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium ( the metallicity in dsphs is indeed much lower than solar , with @xmath62 < fe / h > @xmath63 , see gallagher , grebel & harbeck 2003 ) .",
    "cooling shuts off below @xmath64 k. the initial temperature of the gaseous disks is @xmath65 k for the most massive model ( @xmath66 km / s ) and slightly lower for the other lighter models .",
    "the purpose of running adiabatic simulations is two - fold ; first , it helps in understanding the interplay between thermodynamical and mechanical effects of ram pressure as we shall see in the following section , and second heating by external radiation fields or stellar feedback , especially in low mass objects as those considered in this paper , might overtake radiative cooling and create a hot phase that would essentially behave as an adiabatic gas ( thacker & couchman 2000 ; marcolini et al .",
    "2003 ; springel & hernquist 2003 ) .",
    "therefore radiative cooling and adiabatic runs can be regarded as two extreme cases crudely bracketing the conditions of the real interstellar medium in which a hot and a cold phase will coexist at all times .",
    "finally , in a few runs with cooling we also include a uniform external radiation field which models the cosmic uv background arising at high redshift .",
    "this is implemented using the haardt & madau ( 1996 ) model which includes photoionizing and photoheating rates produced by qsos and galaxies starting at @xmath67 .",
    "we implicitly assume that the dwarf enters the milky way halo at @xmath67 .",
    "the ionizing flux remains quite high until @xmath68 , therefore the dwarf is exposed to the radiation for a duration of @xmath69 gyr .",
    "1.3truecm = 14truecm    we complement our `` full interaction '' runs ( hereafter fi runs ) , so called because they include both tides and ram pressure , with wind tunnel simulations aimed at studying the effect of ram pressure alone .",
    "the volume of the simulations is a tube with rectangular section , having a base equal to the diameter of the dwarf model ( out to its virial radius ) and height @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the typical velocity of the satellite at pericenter in the fi runs ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 is set @xmath74 gyrs ( @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the time the dwarf spends near pericenter of the orbits in the fi runs ) .",
    "we represent the hot gas as a flux of particles moving with a velocity @xmath71 along the longest axis of the tube , this being parallel or at an angle with the angular momentum of the disk depending on the run .",
    "the hot particles have an initial random distribution , a temperature @xmath77 and a number density @xmath78 .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in order to restore the flow of hot gas that leaves the tube .",
    "we will indicate these as wt runs ( where wt stands for wind tunnel ) .",
    "these experiments allow to resolve the background gas flow with very high resolution , thus limiting numerical artifacts like the spurious stripping induced by transfer of momentum in two - body collisions between the hot halo particles and the gas particles in the disk of the dwarf ( abadi , moore & bower 1999 ) .",
    "the mass of the gas particles is equal to that used for the dwarfs in the fi runs , i.e. @xmath50 , for the runs employing our largest dwarf model , v60c4 , while it is 8 times lower for the runs employing the other two models , v28c4 and v40c20 , since these have correspondingly lighter disks .",

    "dwarf galaxies undergo severe stripping owing to the combined action of tides and ram pressure .",
    "the overall mass loss varies depending on the dwarf galaxy model , in particular the depth of its potential well , on its orbit and on the gas physics ( the balance between cooling and heating ) .",
    "dwarfs can retain @xmath79 of their initial gas content or be completely stripped .",
    "ram pressure stripping occurs very rapidly as the galaxy approaches pericenter for the first time .",
    "a bow shock is visible ( figure 2 ) and reflects the fact that the dwarfs near pericenter are moving at mildly supersonic velocities in the hot halo owing to their eccentric orbits ( the mach number is @xmath80 ) .",
    "the tidal shock at first pericenter passage deforms the disk to an extent that depends on how deep is the potential well of the galaxy .",
    "symmetric stellar tidal tails develop but but the gas generally trails the galaxy since ram pressure sweeping dominates ( compare gas and stars in figure 3 ) .",
    "the dark halo loses most of its mass in all cases and the overall depth of the potential well is reduced which increases the efficiency of gas removal .",
    "the stars develop a bar instability due to the strong tidal perturbation ( figure 3 ) which drives a radial gas inflow ( mayer et al .",
    "this inflow counteracts the reduction of the mean restoring force by moving some gas deeper towards the center of the dwarf where it is harder to strip ( note the central density concentration in figure 4 - 6 ) . as a result on subsequent orbits ram pressure stripping continues but with much lower intensity .    in what follows",
    "we will describe the results quantitatively by analyzing the gas mass loss in fi and wt runs as well as the fate of the stripped gas .",
    "figure 7 - 10 show the evolution of the gas component of the dwarfs . in the absence of an external perturbation the stellar disks are stable to bar formation .",
    "removal of gas begins immediately ; a bow shock develops and some gas in the disk rises above the disk plane slightly more than @xmath81 years .",
    "this is evident in the early truncation of the gas surface density profiles ( see figure 12 ) .",
    "the stripped gas is diffuse in adiabatic runs whereas it breaks into clumps pressure confined by the external medium in the cooling runs ( see figure 8) .",
    "the evolution of the temperature of the gas is shown in figure 11 .",
    "as the hot halo pushes the gas out of the disk it also rises its temperature to @xmath82 k as a result of compression .",
    "if radiative cooling is included the gas quickly cools down to @xmath64 k ; cooling occurs on a timescale shorter than @xmath81 years since the gas is heated to temperatures at which the cooling rate is maximum .",
    "occasionally gas particles that did not gain enough momentum to leave the disk fall back towards the midplane as they cool down ( compare for example figures 7 and 8 for run t2c20 - the disk appears more intact at a later time ) .",
    "the distribution of the gas becomes slightly more concentrated towards the midplane of the disk ( see the evolution of the surface density profiles in figure 12 ) , and subsequent stripping is harder . in adiabatic runs , instead , the heated gas remains hot and expands ; the gas disk thickens and it is stripped more easily than in the cooling runs ( see figure 8) as its own pressure support makes it less bound to the disk potential .",
    "no stripped gas falls back to the disk .",
    "1.3truecm = 12truecm    we consider as `` stripped '' all the gas that is removed from the stellar disk .",
    "table 2 also includes the stripping radii found in the simulations , defined as the minimum distance from the center of the dwarf at which gas particles are stripped .",
    "some of the wt runs were performed twice , using a resolution of the background flow equal or higher than that of the fi runs employing the same model ( see section 2.2 ) ; we found differences within 20% for the gas mass loss and even less for the stripping radii .",
    "table 2 reports the gas mass in the disk measured after @xmath83 gyr .",
    "the difference in the amount of stripped mass between runs with and without cooling is visibly higher than that between runs adopting different disk inclinations ; indeed inclination effects are appreciable only when extreme cases are compared , namely an edge - on versus a face - on run ( where the disk inclination is intended relative to the direction of motion of the background gas flow ) .",
    "we note that for the most massive model , v60c4 , we have performed only adiabatic runs since our main goal here is to estimate the maximum amount of mass that can be stripped by ram pressure alone .",
    "the difference between runs with and without radiative cooling is smaller in terms of stripping radii than it could be guessed from the difference in the amount of stripped mass ( table 2 ) .",
    "the reason is that the distribution of gas in the cooling runs becomes more concentrated ( thus a given radius contain more mass ) as we noted before .",
    "1truecm = 5.5truecm    our results show that model v28c4 is completely stripped in all cases ( e.g. figure 9 ) except when cooling and an inclination of 90 degrees with respect to the flow are used at the same time ( both choices go in the direction of minimizing stripping ) .",
    "instead the models v60c4 and v40c20 always retain a significant amount of gas .",
    "this indicates that if the progenitors of dsphs once had massive halos corresponding to @xmath84 km / s , as suggested by recent cosmological simulations ( kravtsov , gnedin & klypin 2004 ) , ram pressure alone was not able to remove their gas early on unless the halo density was once significantly higher than @xmath85 atoms @xmath86 . on the other end",
    ", these results also suggest that efficient gas removal from ram pressure could have happened at some later stage if tides were able to weaken the potential well of the dwarf bringing @xmath6 down to @xmath87 km / s .",

    "gas is removed from the disk of the dwarfs if the ram pressure force is greater than the restoring force per unit area provided by the disk and halo of the dwarf . the condition for ram pressure stripping for an axisymmetric disk system",
    "is expressed by ( gunn & gott 1972 ) @xmath89 where @xmath71 is the velocity of the galaxy with respect to the surrounding medium , @xmath90 is the density of the hot halo of the mw and @xmath91 is the cold gas surface density at the radius @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 represents the surface mass density of the disk .",
    "the minimum radius given by equation ( 2 ) is the final stripping radius @xmath94 beyond which the ism can be removed from the galaxy .",
    "equation ( 2 ) , however , neglects the contribution from dark matter to the restoring force ( see gavazzi et al .",
    "in all of our models the dark matter content is high even near the disk ; we will simply account for that by replacing @xmath95 with @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the surface mass density of the dark matter in a slab with height comparable to the disk thickness and @xmath98 is the surface mass density of the baryons within the same slab ( in our models the gas component always gives a non negligible contribution to the disk mass ) .",
    "this formula describes the instantaneous stripping of gas .",
    "we found it difficult to use this prescription as to reflect both the complex interplay between mechanical and thermodynamical effects seen in the simulations and the fact that the stripping is not exactly instantaneous but continues for some time ( typically it saturates after @xmath99 gyr ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath91 is strongly time dependent due to the action of heating and cooling as we noted above .",
    "we find that a reasonable prediction can be obtained if we choose not the initial @xmath91 but that at the time the gas begins to heat up ( as little as @xmath48 years after the beginning of the simulations )",
    ". the predicted stripping radius ( see table 2 ) can be slightly larger than that in the simulations ( even for runs with cooling ) .",
    "however , the prediction is always close to the stripping radius measured in the simulations at earlier times , i.e. when the approximation of a single , instantaneous stripping event is better satisfied .",
    "0.7truecm = 7truecm      in these runs the dwarf galaxy evolves under the combined action of tides and ram pressure . the mass loss as a function of time for a number of runs",
    "is shown in figure 13 . at",
    "any given time we identify as bound to the dwarf the gas with temperature @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 is the initial virial temperature of the halo of the dwarf , in the range @xmath102 depending on the model ) and which is located within the bound stellar component .",
    "we checked that by using this definition one essentially selects the gas that is gravitationally bound to the dwarf .",
    "the angle between the direction of the flow in the hot halo and the plane of the disk is continously changing because of the orbit of the galaxy and since the disk inclination relative to the orbit changes as the dwarf is tidally torqued by the primary .",
    "we compare the gas mass losses observed in fi runs with those occurring in the face - on wt runs which yield the highest possible gas mass loss due to ram pressure only .",
    "in general galaxies lose more gas compared to wt runs ( compare table 1 and table 2 for both adiabatic and cooling runs ) .",
    "however , as we found previously , only in some of the runs ( mostly those employing model v28c4 ) is the dwarf completely stripped of its gas content ( see table 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , while with tides added a dramatic increase in the stripping is always observed in adiabatic runs , stripping can be unexpectedly less effective in cooling runs ( compare run rc4brc in table 1 with all the `` c4a '' runs in table 2 ) .",
    "this happens because the tidally induced bars funnel @xmath103% of the initial gas content of the disk within a radius smaller than the initial disk scale length of the dwarf .",
    "the gas shocks through the bar as it loses angular momentum and heats up . in adiabatic runs this heat can not be dissipated quickly and the gas ends up more extended . in cooling",
    "runs the gas loses rapidly its thermal energy and there is not enough pressure to stop its inflow . as a result gas profiles become much more concentrated in cooling runs and a larger amount of gas ends up deeper in the potential well where it is harder to strip ( figures 14 - 15 ) . in runs which include",
    "the heating from the uv background the gas remains more extended than with just radiative cooling ( figure 6 ) and stripping is much more efficient , with gas mass losses closer to those of adiabatic runs .",
    "0.7truecm = 7truecm    despite the complex interplay between bar instability and thermal physics , it turns out that the fractional amount of stripped mass correlates well with the initial @xmath6 of the satellite on a given orbit , both with and without cooling ( for example compare run rc4crc and run rc20rc in table 1 , or run rc4arcuv and run rc4brc ) .",
    "for the same initial @xmath6 , orbits with smaller pericenter lead to a larger reduction in the @xmath6 due to more numerous and stronger tidal shocks ( figure 16 ) . this favours ram pressure stripping as it lowers the gravitational restoring force",
    "furthermore , on orbits with a pericenter of 30 kpc the maximum halo gas density is about a factor of 3 higher relative to the case with a pericenter of 50 kpc , and this also favours ram pressure stripping . as a consequence gas mass loss is significantly larger and faster in runs using a more plunging orbit ( table 1 ) .    estimating the stripping radius from formula ( 2 ) is somewhat meaningless in these runs because the depth and shape of the potential of the dwarf is continously changing due to the action of tides and the distribution of the bound gas also changes with time .",
    "nonetheless , it is noteworthy that the stripping radius estimated using formula ( 2 ) with the parameters of the initial models is from 2 to 3 times larger than the radius at which most of the bound gas sits in the fi runs after the first pericenter passage , hence after bar formation and inflow .",
    "this is because the remaining bound gas is that material which flows to the center of the bar .",
    "one interesting feature of cooling runs is that sometimes re - accretion of gas is observed .",
    "this is clearly shown by the sequence in figure 5 ( compare the location of the stars and the gas at the two different times ) and also shows up in some of the curves of the mass loss ( top panel in figure 13 ) .",
    "this happens when gas is stripped from the disk near pericenter but does not have enough momentum to escape the galaxy .",
    "as the galaxy moves towards apocenter , where relative velocities are lower , the gas falls back onto the disk .",
    "this is not observed in adiabatic runs because gas that has been removed from the disk quickly becomes hotter than the virial temperature of the dwarf halo .",
    "we repeated several of these simulations without a gaseous halo to isolate the efficiency of gas removal by tides alone .",
    "the amount of gas stripped is a factor of 3 to 6 less than the simulations which include ram pressure stripping , depending on the radiative cooling ( figure 13 ) .",
    "when compared with the wt runs where only ram pressure is included , tides strip from similar to appreciably lower amounts of mass ( lower panel of figure 13 ) .",
    "the relative increase of stripping when ram pressure is added to tides is maximum for model v40c20 , that has the steepest rise of the dark matter density in the center ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this reflects the different physical scalings of ram pressure and tidal forces . in these highly concentrated halos",
    "the response to tidal shocks is nearly adiabatic near the center ( taffoni et al .",
    "2003 ; kazantzidis et al .",
    "2004 ) , hence stripping is expected to be minimal inside @xmath104 . however ,",
    "this is applicable only to stripping induced by tidal shocks ; the timescale on which istantaneous ram pressure acts is instead much smaller than that of tidal shocks , @xmath105 years ( we follow mori & burkert 2000 for parameters of e.g. run rc20v60rc ) against @xmath106 years ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "such timescale is also smaller than the local gas orbital time even in a highly concentrated halo ( @xmath108 years ) hence the response of the galaxy to ram pressure is impulsive instead of adiabatic . on the other end , the other models , having low concentration haloes ,",
    "respond more impulsively to tides in the first place , so that the increase in stripping efficiency is not so dramatic .",

    "the peak velocity of the rotation curve of the satellites , @xmath6 , drops by @xmath79 after several orbits ( figure 16 ) while in cosmological simulations it often decreases by more than a factor of 2 over several gyr ( kravtsov et al .",
    "2004 , but see ghigna et al .",
    "1998 ) . such difference may be due to the limited number of orbital configurations here explored ( some of the satellites in kravtsov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have pericenters even smaller than 30 kpc ) and/or to the fact that cosmological runs do not include baryons and do not have enough force and mass resolution to follow the complex disk evolution , especially bar formation and the resulting gas inflows that can produce a remarkable increase in the central density ( our force resolution is 5 times better than the best published cosmological simulations with baryons ) .",
    "these issues will be investigated systematically in a forthcoming paper ( kazantzidis , mayer et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in summary , the final gas fractions drops to @xmath109 % of the initial gas content for galaxies on orbits with pericenter of @xmath110 kpc , with @xmath111 being a typical fraction , and to as low as @xmath112 % of the initial values for galaxies on an orbit with pericenter of @xmath5 kpc ( see table 1 ) . in the runs that include the effect of the cosmic uv background even when there is gas left inside the dwarf this is ionized , and the observational upper limit on the mass of neutral hydrogen in dsphs , @xmath113 @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the stellar mass , is fully satisfied .",
    "the gas will be able to recombine later on as the cosmic background fades away , but the local ultraviolet radiation flux from the milky way or m31 might be enough to keep it ionized even at low redshift ( maschenko , carignan & bouchard 2004 ) .",
    "the current upper limits on the total amount of gas in dsphs including the ionized component , are much higher , @xmath116 ( gallagher et al .",
    "2003 ) , and are satisfied in the final states of the dwarfs for the majority of our runs . hence a combination of ram pressure and tidal stripping succeeds in explaining how dwarf spheroidals have little or no neutral hydrogen today . on any given orbit , dwarf models with higher @xmath6",
    "are stripped less severely and , in particular , our most massive model , v60c4 , ( @xmath117 km / s ) , always retains a substantial amount of gas .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that bright dwarf elliptical ( des ) satellites of m31 , like ngc205 , whose central velocity dispersion , @xmath118 km / s , is comparable to that of the evolved states of model v60c4 , do have some amount of neutral gas ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "0.3truecm = 4truecm = 4truecm = 4truecm = 4truecm    .",
    "when neutral gas remains in the dwarfs , most of it will be rapidly turned into stars as it reaches very high densities due to the effect of the bar , and bursts localized near the center of the dwarf are expected at pericenter passages . as described in mayer et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "hence we predict that the higher the mass of the dwarf ( not its luminosity ) the more extended its star formation history should be . for dwarfs that start out with similar masses ,",
    "our simulations suggest that the outcome will vary depending on their orbit .",
    "a signature in the star formation history of the dwarfs is expected at the epoch when it underwent the first close approach within the milky way",

    "gas that survives istantaneous ram pressure can be stripped by the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability developing at the interface between the gas of the dwarf galaxy and the ism ( nulsen 1982 ; murray et al .",
    "1993 , quilis et al .",
    "this is also known as turbulent stripping since the gas reaches a turbulent state as the instability develops .",
    "in order to develop kh instabilities require a sharp boundary to exist between the two fluids . even at the high resolution adopted here",
    "sph is hardly capable of resolving kh instabilities mostly because the artificial viscosity and the fact that densities are smoothed in sph both contribute to `` blur '' any sharp interface .",
    "an approximate `` effective''local kinematical viscosity can be calculated as @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the coefficient of the linear term in the artificial viscosity , @xmath121 is the sound speed and @xmath122 is the sph smoothing length ( lufkin et al .",
    "the reynolds number is then @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the typical size of the object moving in an external medium ( the disk of the dwarf here ) and @xmath125 is the speed at which it is moving ; this number is strictly a function of position ( since @xmath126 is a function of position ) and is in the range @xmath127 in our runs ( the highest reynolds numbers occur in the highest resolution wt runs ) .",
    "this is of course much lower than the reynolds numbers typical of turbulent flows ( up to @xmath64 ) . aside from numerical issues that might hamper the development of kh instabilities in the simulations we can ask whether turbulent stripping is likely to be important for dwarf galaxies moving in a very diffuse halo as those that we are modeling here .",

    "tittley , pearce & couchman ( 2001 ) have shown that sph can alter the magnitude and scaling with density of hydrodynamical drags because of the way pressure forces among neighboring cold and hot background particles are calculated ( in essence the cross section of an object moving in a hot medium can be artificially enhanced or decreased ) . however , the effect is particularly severe , enhancing the drag over the expected value , only in the subsonic regime , whereas our galaxies all move at slightly supersonic velocities .",

    "the central dark matter density measured for the stirred dwarf at the end of the simulation , @xmath151 is also in rough agreement with the value estimated for draco ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "thus run rc20rc produces a model with roughly the right dark matter content but an excessive baryonic content . adding heating and photoionization from a uniform uv background ( run rc20rcuv ) aids gas removal and leaves essentially no neutral gas after a few gyr . in this case the star formation history , as in the adiabatic runs , would have been essentially truncated after the first close encounter with the milky way .",

    "1truecm = 6.6truecm 1truecm = 7.5truecm 1truecm = 7.5truecm    the final luminosity depends on the initial stellar and gas content of the model , which was chosen to be fairly representative of the baryonic content of todays dirrs .",
    "although draco likely had a halo massive enough to resist gas removal from supernovae feedback or photoionization , the progenitors from which it assembled at very high redshift were certainly much smaller and were likely affected by these mechanisms .",

    "in such a scenario , however , environmental effects would not have played the primary role in setting the current high @xmath143 of draco .",
    "one alternative explanation is to imagine that draco was a mostly gaseous disky dwarf by the time it entered the milky way , with minimal star formation having taken place .",
    "such a low star formation rate can be simply the result of an extended , relatively high angular momentum disk being almost everywhere toomre stable and below the density threshold necessary for star formation to happen , as observed today in some dirrs and lsb galaxies ( verde , oh & jimenez 2002 ) . to explore this possibility",

    "these clouds remain cold ( @xmath156 k ) until they are dissolved as they sink deeper in the potential well due to gas drag .",

    "this is consistent with the results found by marcolini et al .",

    "* compressional heating arising as the dwarf travels through the outer medium can significantly enhance ram pressure stripping by producing a more extended gas distribution . as a result",

    "tidally induced bar formation opposes ram pressure stripping by driving a large fraction of gas towards the center where it is harder to strip at subsequent pericenter passages .",

    "these clouds have properties reminiscent of gaseous structures possibly associated with the local group , including some of the hvcs and the hi fragments recently detected around m31 .    we have considered only two types of orbits in this paper . since proper motions of dsphs are poorly constrained ( recent hst - based measurement still have a quite large error , e.g. see piatek et al .",
    "2003 for carina ) there is still quite some freedom in choosing the initial orbits . for example",
    "evolving model v40c20 on an orbit with smaller pericenter , say between 10 and 20 kpc , would enhance both tidal stripping and ram pressure .",
    "more eccentric orbits would lead to higher pericentric velocities which greatly increases the efficiency of ram pressure stripping .",
    "furthermore , the progenitors of dsphs might have suffered both tidal and ram pressure stripping already before entering the milky way halo ( kravtsov et al .",
    "hence our results should be regarded as quite conservative .    as we noted above ,",
    "the initial orbits and initial masses of the dwarfs are both factors that the determine the final dark - to - baryonic mass ratio and other properties of the remnants .",
    "therefore , the fact that fornax and draco have similar masses , as inferred from their velocity dispersions ( kazantzidis et al .",
    "2004 ) , but differ by more than a factor of @xmath163 in their luminosity , can be explained in two ways .",
    "either the progenitors of these two dwarfs started out with very different relative amounts of dark matter and baryons , for reasons related to their formation history and not to the environment , or they descend from very similar progenitors having comparable dark and baryonic masses , but evolved differently because they entered the primary halo at a different epoch and on different orbits .",
    "the ionizing radiation at high redshift also plays a role in determining the efficiency of ram pressure stripping , and its effect again will be stronger for dwarfs infalling at higher redshift .",
    "it is a natural consequence of structure formation in hierarchical models that subhaloes that are found closer to the center of the primary system at @xmath164 are typically those that fell earlier into the potential well of the primary system .",
    "based on their current distances one would conclude , for example , that fornax is likely a more recent addition to the milky way system , and would have suffered fewer and weaker pericenter passages , relative to draco .",
    "it retained some gas after the first one or two orbits , a condition usually satisfied in those of our simulations that have the largest pericenter , and underwent a few bursts over the past few gyr ( mayer et al .",
    "instead , draco entered earlier on a tighter orbit and lost almost all its gas at the first pericenter passage , thus ending star formation early .",
    "we note that for the orbits with a pericenter of @xmath5 kpc pericenter crossing occurs @xmath165 gyr after the dwarf enters the milky way halo .",
    "if the dwarf begins its infall at @xmath166 , i.e @xmath167 gyr after the big bang , this leaves about @xmath168 gyr to form stars before gas removal occurs , consistent with the estimated time span for the star formation history of draco ( grebel & gallagher 2004 ) . while the infall time of the progenitor of draco is clearly a free parameter ,",
    "our results show that these simple assumptions produce a scenario that fits a number of observational constraints .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the milky way halo model used here is based on data at @xmath164 and the components that we assumed as fixed do indeed evolve through cosmic time . at high @xmath169 , as the dwarfs began their route towards the milky way , the dark halo and gaseous halo masses may have been quite different .",
    "however , @xmath0cdm galaxy formation simulations suggest that large disk galaxies had the last major merger quite early on in order for a large enough disk to assemble by @xmath164 , which means most of the dark halo mass was probably already in place at @xmath170 . the evolution of the gaseous halo in @xmath0cdm simulations has not been investigated yet but work in progress suggests its density at several tens of kiloparsecs",
    "could have been ten times higher than the value adopted in this paper . in our simulations ram pressure stripping is most effective close to pericentric passages .",
    "this reflects the fact that we have assumed a smooth density distribution for the hot halo .",
    "if the halo has a complex multiphase structure as predicted by some models ( maller & bullock 2004 ) the dwarfs would move through a clumpy medium and could undergo intense ram pressure stripping even far from pericenter if they encounter a dense and massive cloud .",
    "galaxy formation simulations which follow the build - up and evolution of the gaseous halo at very high resolution with a proper treatment of the multi - phase ism will eventually be able to address this aspect .",
    "however , current cosmological simulations can hardly capture the effect of ram pressure on satellite galaxies even in the case of a smooth halo because of the limited resolution and owing to uncertainties in the star formation and feedback processes which concur to determine the gas fraction in satellite galaxies .",
    "therefore nowadays simulations such as those discussed in this paper represent a necessary counterpart to cosmological runs and provide the only means to test the physical effect of environmental mechanisms in a robust way .",
