    "recently , the discovery of a class of insulator with nontrivial band topology protected by time reversal symmetry@xcite has led to a range of discoveries on the qualitative properties of solids .",
    "soon after , it was realized that this is part of a broader classification of gapped topological phases with free fermions .",
    "if one includes particle hole symmetry , natural for superconducting hamiltonians , one ends up with ten symmetry classes@xcite that include both insulators and gapped superconductors .",
    "the symmetry transformations , time reversal and particle hole symmetry , can be consistently generalized to include disorder and inhomogeneities .",
    "topological phases in these classes are always characterized by protected surface states .",
    "however , one can also discuss band topology in the presence of the point group symmetry of a crystal .",
    "that is , which classes of hamiltonians can be smoothly connected to one another while preserving the insulating gap and the symmetry ?",
    "although these distinctions require considering a perfect crystal , and inevitably fade in the presence of disorder , one often deals with crystals that are sufficiently clean for such distinctions to be useful .",
    "the general classification is a daunting task , given the vast number of symmetry groups of crystals .",
    "for example , there are 230 space groups ; if one adds transformation under time reversal symmetry to describe magnetic insulators , one has 1,651 different groups .",
    "we focus here on a simple case , inversion ( @xmath3 ) , a symmetry that is commonly realized in magnetic insulators .",
    "for example , all bravais lattices are inversion symmetric .",
    "an additional virtue is that inversion symmetry forces the magnetoelectric response to be isotropic and quantized , allowing us to calculate it by qualitative methods . here",
    ", we will classify the topologically distinct inversion symmetric insulators , and determine their protected properties .",
    "( phases of antiferromagnets can also be classified using a similar approach@xcite . )",
    "the classes of three dimensional inversion symmetric insulators are found to be parameterized by three chern numbers and a set of inversion parities .",
    "the chern numbers , which are already present in the absence of inversion symmetry , determine the quantized hall response . while this is an integer in two dimensions , it is given by a reciprocal lattice vector @xmath4 in a three dimensional crystal .",
    "inversion parities are the only additional parameters that appear from adding the extra symmetry .",
    "they are defined at those momenta that are left invariant under @xmath5 , up to a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "this defines eight points in the 3d brillouin zone - the time reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) .",
    "states at these momenta can be classified by their parities , eigenvalues under inversion , which are @xmath6 .",
    "the set of inversion parities of the filled levels at the trims and @xmath4 completely specifies the topological class of the insulator .",
    "usually , distinct topological classes can be distinguished by their surface state content .",
    "a different approach is to identify a quantized response , such as hall conductivity , that can distinguish topological classes . for inversion",
    "symmetric insulators , in general , no protected surface states arise .",
    "this is due to the fact that although inversion is present in the bulk , it is absent at the surface of the system , which separates an inside from an outside .",
    "however , quantized physical response functions exist , and are protected by inversion symmetry .",
    "these include the magnetoelectric susceptibility @xmath1 , which is defined , for example , as the polarization ( @xmath7 ) induced by a magnetic field ( @xmath8 ) , in a parallel direction : @xmath9 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath1 requires both bulk and surface to be insulating and is defined modulo @xmath10 . under time reversal , @xmath11 .",
    "apart from the trivial solution @xmath12 , the ambiguity in the definition of @xmath1 allows also for @xmath13 . the latter was shown to occur in time reversal symmetric topological insulators , when magnetic perturbations restricted to the surface open a surface gap @xcite .    under inversion symmetry",
    ", @xmath1 transforms in the same way as under time reversal .",
    "once again we expect @xmath2 .",
    "the latter case is particularly interesting since the magnetoelectric susceptibility is large and no extra effort will usually be required to gap out surface states , in contrast to topological insulators .",
    "typically , one does not expect surface modes in the inversion symmetric case .",
    "the response @xmath1 is determined just by the parities of the states at trims , according to a formula derived below ( which is analogous to formulae for the time reversal - symmetric cases @xcite ) .",
    "thus it will be possible to determine the magnetoelectric susceptibility without doing any band integrals .",
    "this should be useful in the search for large @xmath1 insulators in magnetically ordered materials .",
    "moreover , in magnetic insulators a large spin orbit coupling is not a priori required to obtain the phase with @xmath13 , which opens up a wider selection of candidates .",
    "a second set of results are in the form of constraints on the allowed values of trim parities and chern numbers @xmath14 .",
    "we first show that in any insulator , a _ parity constraint _",
    "is present .",
    "the product of the trim parities of filled states is always @xmath0 . while this is a trivial condition",
    "when time reversal is also present , and energy levels come in kramers pairs , it is rather non - trivial for magnetic insulators .",
    "for example , the parity assignment in fig .",
    "[ fig : bingo]a rules out a band gap .",
    "a corollary of this result is that it is impossible to make a direct continuous transition between a @xmath12 and @xmath13 insulator , if time reversal is broken .",
    "one must either evolve through a non - insulating state , or a first order transition .",
    "a continuous transition only exists if both time reversal and inversion are present@xcite .",
    "another constraint fixes whether the three components of @xmath15 , are even or odd in relation to the trim parities .",
    "the intrinsic polarization @xmath16 of the insulator is also determined by the parities .",
    "finally we consider the entanglement .",
    "the entanglement spectrum of topological insulators contains special modes@xcite .",

    "this result is used to rederive some of the electromagnetic properties in a simple fashion .",
    "the present article addresses some questions left open in earlier work in which we participated .",
    "ref . discusses the entanglement spectrum of inversion symmetric insulators , without presenting the exact relation to trim parities .",
    "the proofs given here also complete the reasoning presented in @xcite which studied the electronic structure of a specific material using the expressions for @xmath1 in terms of trim parities and the parity constraint .    in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief survey of all of our results and a guide to the sections where their proofs can be found .",
    "the phases associated with a given symmetry can be classified using some topology .",
    "each state can be classified by integer - valued parameters ( or by integers relative some modulus ) .",
    "these can not change continuously , so they determine phases .",
    "let us first define some conventions about the crystal lattice .",
    "we will for simplicity assume that the lattice is cubic ( although there is no symmetry beyond inversion ) and has a lattice spacing equal to one unit .",
    "all quantities will be written with respect to a coordinate system @xmath17 that is aligned with the axes of the crystal .",

    "electrical polarization is a real space vector ; 3d hall conductivity and momentum are in reciprocal space ( and we also use upper and lower indices on the coordinates as a reminder of what basis to use ) .    to classify bulk insulators ,",
    "it is useful to look at inversion parities , as in the study of spectra of small molecules .",

    "the maximum weight schmidt state is obtained by placing electrons on the left half when @xmath816 and on the right half when @xmath817 . if we can only see the left half , this is equivalent to filling all the negative  energy \" states .",
    "the negative energy states on the right are also filled since @xmath818 .",
    "so the maximum weight state is the product @xmath320 of the ground states of @xmath270 and @xmath276 .",
    "suppose @xmath84 is prescribed at a certain trim .",
    "the number of arcs passing through this trim must be equal to @xmath819 modulo 2 . to show this",
    ", we use the @xmath820 effective hamiltonian in the space of states that have energy zero at @xmath82 to determine how the energies vary away from @xmath82 .",
    "suppose for simplicity that all the modes at the trim have the same @xmath80 parity ( the generic case ) .",
    "then particle - hole symmetry implies that the effective hamiltonian is odd in @xmath821 , to leading order @xmath822 .",
    "hence @xmath823 , in polar coordinates .",
    "the energy - dependence has a cone - like structure : @xmath824 where @xmath825 are the eigenvalues of the periodic hamiltonian @xmath826 .",
    "now the particle - hole symmetry implies that the bands come in pairs satisfying @xmath827 , or in other words that @xmath828 .",
    "thus between @xmath1 and @xmath829 , the energies must be turned upside down .",
    "this relates the dispersions @xmath830 in pairs , except for the middle one @xmath831 ( if @xmath267 is odd ) which is related to itself .",
    "this mode changes sign from @xmath193 to @xmath53 by the symmetry , so it crosses through 0 at an odd number @xmath832 of values of @xmath1 in between , and crosses zero again at @xmath832 points @xmath833 away . when the solutions to @xmath834 are graphed , these crossings correspond to @xmath832 arcs passing through the trim .",
    "the other pairs of modes @xmath830 and @xmath835 together give rise to an even number of arcs .",
    "thus , the parity of the number of fermi arcs is equal to the parity of @xmath267 .",
    "though the parity of the number of arcs is determined by @xmath267 s parity , the precise number of arcs is not .",
    "for example , when @xmath836 , there may be no zero - energy states away from the trim , as in the dirac equation .",
    "from the point of view of standard electrostatics , one expects a cubic crystal , aligned with the @xmath837 , and @xmath41 axes , with polarization @xmath16 , to have a surface charge of @xmath204 per unit cell on the @xmath838 surfaces .",
    "however , in general , a material may have some stray charges on the surface .    in some situations",
    ", the surface charge is expected to be determined ( almost ) by the theoretical value of the polarization@xcite .",
    "this does not always happen because there may be extra charge trapped on the surface .",
    "but for a _ clean _ surface ( that is , a perfectly periodic one ) the ambiguity can be reduced : the charge density per unit cell is given by @xmath204 up to an integer multiple of @xmath62 , if the surface is gapped .",
    "if there are no modes at the fermi energy on the surface , then @xmath839 ( the surface charge per unit cell ) .",
    "the surface charge may be changed by @xmath840 by filling @xmath166 surface bands .",
    "it is not possible to add a fractional multiple of @xmath62 to each cell , since then the surface will become conducting , according to the theorem that an insulator must have a whole number of electrons per unit cell , unless strong interactions produce an unusual phase .",
    "( since we are assuming time reversal to be broken , generically , an odd number of electrons _ can _ form an insulator . )",
    "this prediction for the surface charge may be generalized to allow for a metallic surface . in this case",
    "there is a two dimensional fermi surface describing the modes on the surface .",
    "the polarization is @xmath841 where @xmath842 is the area of the surface arcs .",
    "the second term can be interpreted as the charge that needs to be removed to make the surface insulating .",
    "if a crystal has a fractional polarization of @xmath204 , then there are three possibilities .",
    "the surface may be electrically charged ( with a density of @xmath843 per unit cell for some integer @xmath166 ) , or it may be metallic .",
    "the surface may also reconstruct , so that there is a charge density wave .",
    "when @xmath204 is a simple fraction , this is very likely , since then the charge density wave would be commensurate .",
    "for example , when @xmath844 ( as expected for inversion - symmetric insulators ) the surface could have a period two reconstruction . the surface might also be metallic , but a big spontaneous surface charge seems unlikely . since the  intrinsic \" polarization may be exchanged for a surface property , a scanning tunneling microscope may be the best tool for observing it .",
    "the polarization may be determined by noting that the entanglement hamiltonian @xmath270 has to satisfy the same constraints on its surface charge .",
    "we can just determine @xmath845 and @xmath842 for the ground state of @xmath270 .",
    "assume @xmath57 .",
    "then the number of arcs through each trim has the same parity , either even or odd ( according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : weaves ] ) ) .",
    "the fermi surface covers half the brillouin zone if this number is odd , so according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : half ] ) , @xmath846 where @xmath847 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : seesaw ] ) .",
    "the second line uses @xmath848    now , if there are no nuclei at @xmath774 , then as in sec .",
    "[ sec : entanglement ] , one can use the neutrality of the schmidt spectrum and symmetry to show that @xmath849 .",
    "if on @xmath774 there are nuclei of total atomic number per cell @xmath850 , imagine taking these nuclei out of the system .",
    "this leaves behind a charge of @xmath851 which must be divided evenly between the left and right half .",
    "focus on the left half of the system ; it has a charge of @xmath852 .",
    "now substitute @xmath845 and @xmath842 into eq .",
    "( [ juniper ] ) .",
    "combine the @xmath35 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nnn ] ) with @xmath845 to get @xmath853 . by neutrality @xmath35 is the total atomic number per unit cell , so @xmath854 is the atomic number of the nuclei not on @xmath774 , which is congruent mod @xmath68 to @xmath855 ( the number of nuclei at @xmath856 ) because the other nuclei come in pairs .",
    "hence the polarization is @xmath857 .",
    "this agrees with eq .",
    "( [ eq : polarization ] ) because the dipole moment of the nuclei relative to @xmath774 is @xmath858 .",
    "nuclei not on the two special planes @xmath193 and @xmath772 come in pairs and cancel out .",
    "( we are defining the dipole moment of the nuclei to be the sum over a unit cell bounded by @xmath859 in the @xmath209-direction . )",
    "this appendix determines what subset of the space of @xmath223 vectors is spanned by integer combinations of frozen crystals .",
    "let @xmath860 be vectors corresponding to systems with a single fixed electron in each unit cell displace by @xmath225 from the bravais lattice .    for each of the @xmath861 nonzero polarizations @xmath225 , @xmath860",

    "take an @xmath871 matrix whose columns are the @xmath233 s and do column operations .",
    "the only operations that are allowed are adding or subtracting multiples of one column to another or changing the sign of a column .",
    "these operations do not change the lattice spanned by the @xmath233 s .",
    "( they can be inverted without dividing by integers . )",
    "this process leads to the following basis : @xmath872 , @xmath873 , @xmath874 , and @xmath875 and vectors symmetric with these .",
    "here,@xmath872 is the vector with ones at all corners of the cube , @xmath873 is the vector with ones on the _ face _ of the cube defined by @xmath876 ( and zeros elsewhere ) , @xmath240 is the vector with ones on the _ edge _ defined by @xmath241 , and @xmath243 is the vector with a one at the _ vertex _ @xmath241 .",
    "the procedure for changing the basis from @xmath877 to @xmath878 ( where @xmath879 run over @xmath880 ) consists of changing one of the four groups of @xmath233 s to @xmath239 s at a time .",
    "first @xmath881 so we can just rename the sequence of vectors @xmath882 . next , replace @xmath883 by @xmath884 , which is equal to @xmath874 .",
    "this is one of the column operations just described ( it changes a vector in the third set by adding other vectors to it ) .",
    "do the same for the other pairs of @xmath880 .",
    "last replace @xmath885 by @xmath886 each of these relations makes the ones cancel out except on just the right vertex or edge of the cube .",
    "some thought leads to a similar demonstration that @xmath887 and @xmath243 ( without the factors of @xmath68 and @xmath58 ) span _ all _ combinations of @xmath888 integers .",
    "therefore any vector @xmath223 can be decomposed as @xmath889 where @xmath890 is an even integer and @xmath891 is a multiple of four .",
    "an even part of @xmath890 and a multiple of 4 contained in @xmath891 can be combined with the @xmath892-terms to form a vector that represents an inert insulator @xmath233 , leaving the remainder given in eq .",
