    "the predicted masses of the disks , however , are @xmath3a few to @xmath3a few hundred times higher than the masses of the central protostar , and hence the disks are subject to further fragmentation . thus further long - term simulations are required to reproduce the observed keplerian disks around the class i protostars . to provide observational insights to theoretical models , it is important to identify a keplerian disk just after the transition from the pseudo - disk , and to compare its properties to those of previously - identified keplerian disks and the theoretical models .",
    "millimeter continuum observations have also revealed evidence for disks around binary protostars , `` circumbinary disks '' @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing to investigate whether keplerian rotation is present in those circumbinary disks as well as disks around single protostars .",
    "although the class i protostars around which keplerian disks have been found are thought to be single , it is possible that many and perhaps all are binary ( or multiple ) given the high frequency of binarity around pre - ms and ms solar - mass stars @xcite , as has been suggested for l1489 irs @xcite .",

    "the same methods and the flux density of the central component derived from the 2-dimensional gaussian fitting ( @xmath30.73 jy ) give the mass of the central component of @xmath30.02 - 0.09 @xmath5 . subtraction of this mass from @xmath28 gives the mass of the rest of the emission components of @xmath30.03 - 0.12 @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ mom0 ] shows integrated intensity maps in @xmath0co ( 32 ) and c@xmath2o ( 32 ) . in both @xmath0co and c@xmath2o ,",
    "the emission is elongated along the north - west to south - east direction .",
    "this elongation is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the [ fe ii ] jets driven by source a , just like the ring - like structure seen in the continuum .",
    "furthermore , just like this structure , the emission in both lines has outer dimensions of @xmath3600 @xmath4 300 au . although the overall sizes and position angles of the major axes of molecular and ring - like continuum structures are similar , their internal structures are quite different .",
    "the three peaks seen in the continuum emission are not evident in @xmath0co and c@xmath2o .",
    "instead , the @xmath0co emission exhibits a single peak between source a and source b ( @xmath340 au nw from source a ) , whereas the bright central peak in the continuum emission is located @xmath330 au se from source a. the positional accuracy of the @xmath0co emission peak can be approximately estimated as @xmath3beam size / signal - to - noise ratio @xmath65 au , and that of the continuum emission peak @xmath61 au .",
    "thus , the positional offsets of the @xmath0co emission peak from the continuum peak and the position of source a are statistically significant .",
    "by contrast , the c@xmath2o emission does not show a central peak , but instead shows two peaks at @xmath380 au nw and @xmath3170 au se from source a , closer in than the two outer continuum peaks which are located @xmath3210 au nw and se from source a. the positional accuracy of these two c@xmath2o emission peaks is estimated to be @xmath613 au , and that of the two continuum peaks @xmath65 au .",
    "therefore , the offsets of the two c@xmath2o emission peaks from the outer continuum peaks are also real .",
    "the different emission distributions are likely due to the combination of different amounts of envelope ( and , in molecular lines , possibly also ambient ) emission recovered , differences in optical depths , and molecular abundance variations ; these different effects are difficult to disentangle with the available data .",
    "figures [ ch13 ] and [ ch18 ] show velocity channel maps of the @xmath0co and c@xmath2o lines , respectively . around @xmath47 @xmath37 km s@xmath16 ,",
    "both the @xmath0co and c@xmath2o emission are significantly suppressed , a likely effect of missing flux at the ambient velocity of the molecular gas immediately around l1551 ne .",
    "indeed , single - dish cs ( 32 , 54 , 76 ) spectra towards l1551 ne show a central velocity of @xmath47 @xmath37 km s@xmath16 @xcite . a single - dish c@xmath2o ( 32 )",
    "spectrum taken towards l1551 ne with the cso shows two distinct components : one having a narrower velocity width ( @xmath30.68 km s@xmath16 ) with a central velocity of @xmath47 @xmath36.7 km s@xmath16 , and the other having a broader velocity width ( @xmath32.2 km s@xmath16 ) with a central velocity of @xmath47 @xmath37.0 km s@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the velocity range and the central velocity of the broader component are similar to those of the c@xmath2o emission observed with the sma .",
    "we therefore adopt a systemic velocity for l1551 ne of @xmath47 = 7 km s@xmath16 . in the @xmath0co velocity channel maps , there are high - velocity blueshifted ( 2.5 - 3.6 km s@xmath16 ) and redshifted ( 9.8 - 10.2 km s@xmath16 ) components just displaced to the west and east of source a , respectively .",
    "these high - velocity @xmath0co components are not detected in the c@xmath2o emission . in the lower - blueshifted velocity ( @xmath33.9 - 5.8 km s@xmath16 )",
    ", both the @xmath0co and c@xmath2o emission are located predominantly to the north of the protobinary , and in the lower - redshifted velocity ( @xmath37.6 km s@xmath16 - 9.5 km s@xmath16 ) to the south of the protobinary . furthermore , the extents of the @xmath0co and c@xmath2o emission appear to become progressively larger as the velocity approaches the systemic velocity .",
    "a comparison of the sma c@xmath2o ( 32 ) integrated spectrum with the cso c@xmath2o ( 32 ) spectrum shows that from @xmath33.9 to 5.4 km s@xmath16 and from @xmath38.7 to 9.5 km s@xmath16 almost 100@xmath20 of the total c@xmath2o ( 32 ) flux is recovered in our sma observations , although the limited signal - to - noise ratio of the single - dish spectrum at the line wings prevents us from accurately estimating the amount of the recovered flux .",
    "thus , the systematic increase in the spatial extent of the c@xmath2o ( 32 ) emission over these velocity ranges , where the detection level is more than 6@xmath48 except for that at the bluest and the reddest velocities , is probably real . to better highlight the spatial - kinematic distributions of the different features traced by the @xmath0co and c@xmath2o emission , we integrated these velocity channel maps over the four different velocity ranges discussed above , that is , high - blueshifted ( 2.5 km s@xmath16 - 3.6 km s@xmath16 ) and redshifted velocities ( 9.8 km s@xmath16 - 10.2 km s@xmath16 ) where only @xmath0co emission is detected , and low - blueshifted ( 3.9 km s@xmath16 to 5.8 km s@xmath16 ) and redshifted velocities ( 7.6 km s@xmath16 to 9.5 km",
    "s@xmath16 ) where c@xmath2o emission is also detected ( figure [ br1318 ] ) .",
    "overall , the low - velocity blueshifted and redshifted components in the @xmath0co and c@xmath2o maps are located to the north - west and south - east , respectively , of the l1551 ne system . furthermore",
    ", the axis connecting the blueshifted and redshifted emission peaks is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the [ fe ii ] jets driven by source a ( see blue and red arrows in figure [ br1318 ] ) . although the symmetric center of the blueshifted and redshifted emission appears to be closer to the position of source a , pinpointing the precise location of the symmetric center may not be straightforward as it seems .",
    "a comparison with the cso c@xmath2o ( 32 ) spectrum indicates that the amount of the missing flux at the blueshifted part of the sma c@xmath2o emission is more than that at the redshifted part ( for example , at @xmath49 - 1.0 km s@xmath16 the amount of the missing flux is @xmath380@xmath20 , while at @xmath49 + 1.0 km s@xmath16 @xmath360@xmath20 ) .",
    "furthermore , the location of l1551 ne overlaps with the spatially - extended redshifted ( @xmath37 - @xmath312 km s@xmath16 ) outflow driven by l1551 irs 5 @xcite .",
    "thus the redshifted part of the @xmath0co emission may be more severely affected by missing flux than the blueshifted part .",
    "these `` asymmetric '' contributions from the extended components may distort the `` balance '' between the blueshifted and redshifted emission distributions .",
    "in the high - velocity range , the compact ( @xmath3100 au ) blueshifted and redshifted @xmath0co components are located to the north - west and south - east of source a , respectively .",
    "the position angle of the axis connecting the high - velocity blueshifted and redshifted @xmath0co components is different from that of the low - velocity components ; specifically , this axis is not orthogonal to the axis of the [ fe ii ] jets driven by source a. these results imply that the origin of these high - velocity @xmath0co components is different from that of the low - velocity components .",
    "figure [ mom1 ] shows intensity - weighted mean - velocity maps of the low - velocity @xmath0co and c@xmath2o emission . as mentioned above",
    ", the low - velocity blueshifted emission is distributed north - west and redshifted emission south - east of the l1551 ne system .",
    "we do not detect a velocity gradient along the minor axis of this structure indicative of an inflow , or contamination by an outflow .",
    "thus , both the spatial and kinematic major axes of this feature are approximately perpendicular to the axis of the associated [ fe ii ] jets ( blue and red arrows in figure [ mom1 ] ) .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the @xmath0co ( 32 ) and c@xmath2o ( 32 ) emission immediately surrounding l1551 ne exhibit a conspicuous velocity gradient along their major axes perpendicular to the axis of the [ fe ii ] jets driven by source a. such a velocity gradient could be produced by either a purely rotating or a rotating and contracting ( @xmath44 , infalling component ) disk . to differentiate between these possibilities",

    "our model fit of an infalling disk to the c@xmath2o velocity channel maps , on the other hand , can not find the local @xmath73 minimum within the range of @xmath57 from 109@xmath13 to 199@xmath13 ; @xmath44 , the disk major axis is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the [ fe ii ] jets and more than 45@xmath13 away from the jet axis .",
    "these results show that a simple geometrically - thin keplerian - disk model with only three fitting parameters reproduces the global velocity feature in the c@xmath2o velocity channel maps .",
    "the position angle of the keplerian rotation is consistent with the major axis of the c@xmath2o total integrated intensity map , and is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the [ fe ii ] jets driven by source a. the estimated inclination angle of the disk from the plane of the sky is also approximately perpendicular to the inferred inclination angle of the [ fe ii ] jets of @xmath63 = 30@xmath13 - 45@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the position angle and the extent of the keplerian disk in the c@xmath2o emission are similar to those of the ring - like structure in the 335 ghz continuum emission surrounding the binary protostars .",
    "these results show that the circumbinary continuum feature is indeed a keplerian disk surrounding the l1551 ne binary system , or `` keplerian circumbinary disk '' .",
    "interestingly , the estimated position and inclination angles of the circumbinary disk around l1551 ne are similar to those of the circumstellar disks @xcite and the protostellar envelope @xcite around l1551 irs 5 , but their rotation is in the opposite directions ( in l1551 irs 5 the northern part is redshifted ) .",
    "by contrast , we could not find a satisfactory keplerian fit ( the peak residual is more than 10@xmath48 ) to the @xmath0co velocity channel maps .",
    "the same keplerian - disk parameters do reproduce the overall spatial - velocity distributions in the @xmath0co velocity channel maps , albeit with large residuals , presumably because the @xmath0co emission is optically thick and likely affected by the contamination from the extended envelope component and possibly the outflow from l1551 irs 5 .",
    "our simple geometrically - thin disk model , which implicitly assumes optically - thin emission , can not therefore be accurately applied for the @xmath0co emission .",
    "figure [ pv ] shows position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams of the @xmath0co ( @xmath81 @xmath82 ) and c@xmath2o emission ( @xmath83 ) along the major ( @xmath84 ) and minor axes ( @xmath85 ) of the model keplerian disks , passing through the location of source a. in the p - v diagrams along the major axis , the blueshifted and redshifted components are distinctly separated and located to the north and south , respectively , of l1551 ne .",
    "the emission at higher velocities is located closer to source a than that at lower velocities , with this trend more pronounced in the @xmath0co line .",
    "the best - fit keplerian - rotation curve is shown overlaid as solid black curves , and the upper and lower ends of the rotational velocity derived from the error bars of the fitting parameters from the @xmath73-fitting overlaid as dashed black curves . for comparison , a rotation curve with conserved angular momentum as expected for infalling gas ( @xmath67 = 6@xmath410@xmath86 pc km s@xmath16 ; red curve ) is also plotted .",
    "although both black and red curves trace the higher - velocity parts close to the center ( @xmath47 @xmath32.5 - 4.5 km s@xmath16 & 9 - 10 km s@xmath16 ) equally well , the keplerian - rotation curve better traces the lower - velocity parts ( @xmath35 - 6 km s@xmath16 & 8 - 9 km s@xmath16 ) .",
    "we note that the effect of the missing flux may distort the true rotation curves .",
    "keplerian - rotation curves ( @xmath87 ) are , however , shallower than rotation curves with conserved angular momenta ( @xmath88 ) , and thus the spatial extent of the keplerian disk at a given velocity is larger , as shown by the black and red curves .",
    "hence , it is possible that a genuine keplerian rotation mimics a @xmath89 rotation due to the effects of missing flux , but it is unlikely that the effect of the missing flux distorts a genuine @xmath89 rotation to a keplerian rotation .",
    "our sma observations of l1551 ne in the @xmath0co and c@xmath2o ( 32 ) lines have revealed a keplerian disk around the protobinary system . from the outer extent of the molecular - line distributions ,",
    "the outermost detectable radius of the keplerian disk is estimated to be @xmath3300 au .",
    "the ring - like component seen in the 335 ghz continuum emission likely traces this keplerian circumbinary disk , while the central component may arise from circumstellar disks around the binary companions .",
    "the central mass derived from the keplerian fitting ( @xmath30.8 @xmath5 ) is likely the mass of the protobinary , since the mass of the keplerian circumbinary disk plus circumstellar disks derived from the 335 ghz continuum emission ( @xmath30.047 @xmath5 ) is much smaller .",
    "previous interferometric observations of class 0 protostars have revealed infalling motion in compact ( @xmath6600 au ) circumstellar structures ; @xmath44 , peudo - disks @xcite . on the other hand , the large sma survey for protostellar sources ( `` prosac '' project ) has found keplerian disks in the hco@xmath90 ( 32 ) line around four class i protostars ( l1489-irs , irs 63 , elias 29 , and irs 43 ) out of their ten class i samples @xcite , one of which ( l1489-irs ) was reported as a protobinary @xcite . in the other six class",
    "i sources the velocity fields traced by the hco@xmath90 ( 32 ) line are rather complicated , presumably due to the contamination from the outflows .",
    "the reported keplerian disks have radii @xmath3100 - 200 au and masses @xmath910.007 to 0.055 @xmath5 , and enclosed stellar masses 0.37 - 2.5 @xmath5 .",
    "these results imply that keplerian disks can be present around class i protostars as well as t - tauri stars ( e.g. , guilloteau & dutrey 1998 ; guilloteau et al .",
    "the measured physical properties of these protostars and the keplerian disks , including those of l1551 ne , are summarize in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "table [ tbl-2 ] shows that there are no clear differences of the disk radius and the enclosed stellar mass between l1551 ne and the other sources . on the other hand ,",
    "the bolometric temperature of l1551 ne ( @xmath12 = 91 k ) is a factor @xmath73 lower than that of the other protostars , and the mass of the surrounding envelope around l1551 ne is a factor of @xmath34 higher than that of l1489-irs and over an order of magnitude higher than that around the other protostars .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of the central protostellar mass to the total ( star + disk + envelope ) mass is the lowest in l1551 ne (= 65@xmath20 ) .",
    "these results imply that either l1551 ne will evolve into a much more massive star compared with the other protostars listed in table [ tbl-2 ] , or l1551 ne is the youngest class i protostar yet found to have a keplerian disk . since the l1551 region forms solar - type ( @xmath61 @xmath5 ) stars @xcite , the former case is unlikely . thus , we suggest that l1551 ne has experienced `` transition '' from an infalling , pseudo - disk to a keplerian disk most recently among the class i sources with the keplerian disks",
    ". the formation mechanism of keplerian disks around protostars will be discussed in the next section .",
    "our sma observations of l1551 ne provide firm evidence that keplerian circumbinary disks are present in addition to keplerian circumstellar disks around class i protostars . on the theoretical side , however , it is still difficult to form keplerian disks around either single or multiple protostars .",
    "mellon & li ( 2008 ; 2009 ) have conducted 2-d axisymmetric simulations of the collapse of rotating , magnetized singular isothermal cores .",
    "they found that , even in the case of weak initial magnetic fields ( mass - to - flux ratio @xmath17 @xmath6100 ) , magnetic fields efficiently carry angular momenta outwards , preventing the formation of a rotationally - supported disk .",
    "they showed that a field strength in the dense core l1544 inferred observationally ( @xmath17 @xmath610 ; crutcher & troland 2000 ) completely suppresses the formation of the centrifugally - supported disk , even if the ambipolar diffusion is taken into account .",
    "they concluded that additional processes , such as ohmic dissipation , hall effect , or the dispersion of the surrounding envelope that anchors the magnetic brake , are required for a keplerian disk to form .",
    "machida et al . ( 2010 ; 2011a ; b ) have performed 3-d magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a bonnor - ebert sphere with a mass of 1 @xmath5 and different initial rotations and magnetic fields , and have calculated the evolutions .",
    "their simulations show that the first adiabatic core formed prior to the formation of the protostar becomes a centrifugally - supported disk with a size of @xmath7100 au by the end of the calculations .",
    "their results show that , however , the mass of the formed disk is considerably ( @xmath3factor 2 - 100 ) larger than that of the central protostar ( see also vorobyov 2009 ) , and hence the formed disk is subject to further fragmentation .",
    "further long - term simulations , including calculations of fragmentations of the massive disks and subsequent evolutions , are required to theoretically reproduce the observed keplerian disks around the class i protostars .",
    "although a keplerian circumbinary disk is identified around l1551 ne , l1551 ne is associated with active jets @xcite and molecular outflows @xcite , suggesting presence of accreting circumstellar disks around the binary companions .",
    "the central compact dust emission ( figure [ cont ] ) may indeed arise from the circumstellar disks .",
    "simulations of fragmentations of a first core or a massive disk into multiple protostellar systems ( @xmath44 , machida et al .",
    "2008 ) and the further evolutions are required to reproduce a keplerian circumbinary disk plus accreting circumstellar disks in a protobinary system . in the case of binary protostars , tidal effects from the two protostars can transport rotational angular momenta outwards and create a `` gap '' in the circumbinary disk @xcite . furthermore , the inward transportation of magnetic fields in binary systems may be quite different from that around single protostars , because the mass accretion toward the binary protostars can occur through `` spiral '' accretion streams that connects between the inner edge of the circumbinary disk and the circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "the high - velocity @xmath0co components shown in figure [ br1318 ] may correspond to such accretion streams .",
    "if the angular momentum transported outwards piles up at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk , this disk can then assume keplerian rotation .",
    "finally , we will comment on an interesting application of keplerian circumbinary disks . by measuring the position of the keplerian rotation center with respect to the binary positions , in principle it is also possible to derive binary mass ratios , orbital radii , and orbital periods of binary protostars .",
    "our @xmath73 model fitting of the geometrically - thin keplerian disk with the fixed rotational center at the position of source a provides a reasonable fitting result .",
    "this result may suggest that the mass of source a is higher than that of source b , although our search for the minimum @xmath73 point of the rotational center failed to obtain a statistically significant result ( at the positions of sources a and b the reduced @xmath73 values are @xmath31.5 and @xmath31.8 , respectively . ) . if we could pinpoint the rotational center , the binary mass ratio can simply be estimated from the ratio of the distances from the rotational center to the primary and to the secondary .",
    "this is potentially a strong method to measure mass ratios of protostellar binaries , since previous multi - epoch ( @xmath92 5 yr ) , high - resolution ( @xmath30@xmath211 ) observations of proper motions of protobinary systems could only deduce the reduced masses @xcite .",
    "we can also measure the de - projected orbital radii assuming that the binary stars are in the same plane of the circumbinary disks . from the binary masses , mass ratios , and the de - projected orbital radii the orbital periods",
    "can also be obtained .",
    "these measurements could put stringent constraints on theories of binary formation .",
    "we have carried out sub - arcsecond resolution sma observations of the protobinary system l1551 ne in the 335 ghz continuum , @xmath0co ( 32 ) , and the c@xmath2o ( 32 ) emission .",
    "the main results are summarized below :    \\1 .",
    "the 335 ghz continuum emission in l1551 ne shows an intense central peak close to the protobinary , and secondary peaks to the north and south of the protobinary system located almost symmetrically with respect to the position of the protobinary . the central component may arise from circumstellar disks around each binary companion .",
    "the northern and southern components comprise a @xmath3600 au scale circumbinary disk , approximately perpendicular to the axis of the associated [ fe ii ] jets driven by source a. the mass of the circumstellar disk is estimated to be @xmath30.02 - 0.09 @xmath5 , and that of the circumbinary disk @xmath30.03 - 0.12 @xmath5 .",
    "the extent and position angle of the @xmath0co ( 32 ) and c@xmath2o ( 32 ) emission are similar to those of the 335 ghz continuum emission , although the locations of the emission peaks are different among the @xmath0co , c@xmath2o , and the 335 ghz emission .",
    "both the @xmath0co and c@xmath2o emission show a systematic velocity gradient along the major axis , which is perpendicular to the axis of the [ fe ii ] jets , such that their blueshifted and the redshifted emission are located to the north and south of the protostellar binary , respectively .",
    "in addition to this global velocity gradient , the high - velocity ( @xmath73 km s@xmath16 ) @xmath0co emission exhibits compact ( @xmath3100 au ) blueshifted and redshifted components to the north - west and south - east of source a with a different position angle from that of the circumbinary disk . we speculate that the high - velocity @xmath0co components correspond to accretion streams that connects between the inner edge of the circumbinary disk and the circumstellar disks .",
    "@xmath73 model fitting of geometrically - thin keplerian disks to the observed @xmath0co and c@xmath2o velocity channel maps was conducted .",
    "the c@xmath2o velocity channel maps are well - reproduced by a geometrically - thin keplerian disk model with a central stellar mass of 0.8@xmath78 @xmath5 , disk position angle of 167@xmath13@xmath79 , and a disk inclination angle of -62@xmath13@xmath80 , and a rotational center at the position of source a. on the other hand , the @xmath0co velocity channel maps can not be fitted with any geometrically - thin keplerian disk model . this is probably because the @xmath0co emission is optically thick and is likely affected by the contamination from the outflow and the extended envelope component .",
    "\\4 . among the class i sources with identified keplerian disks , l1551",
    "ne is likely the youngest source , since l1551 ne has the lowest bolometric temperature ( @xmath391 k ) , highest envelope mass ( @xmath30.39 @xmath5 ) , and the lowest ratio in stellar mass to envelope + disk + stellar mass ( @xmath30.65 ) .",
    "we suggest that l1551 ne has just passed from the `` pseudo - disk '' phase seen around class 0 protostars to the keplerian - disk phase .",
    "our sma observations of l1551 ne provide firm evidence that keplerian disks around binary protostars , keplerian circumbinary disks , are present as well as keplerian disks around single protostars .",
    "current theoretical studies can not reproduce observationally - identified keplerian disks around single or multiple protostars . in the case of binary protostars , tidal effects from two protostars can transport rotational angular momenta outward , and pile up the angular momenta at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk effectively .",
    "furthermore , the inward transportation of magnetic fields in binary systems may be quite different from that around single protostars , because the mass accretion toward the binary protostars can occur through `` spiral '' accretion streams from the inner edge of the circumbinary disk to the circumstellar disks .",
    "these mechanisms could create a keplerian circumbinary disk around binary protostars .",
    "higher - resolution observations of l1551 ne with alma and / or evla , which can separate between the circumstellar disks and the circumbinary disk and resolve the accretion streams connecting between the circumbinary disk and the circumstellar disks , are required to fully understand the origin of the keplerian circumbinary disk plus the circumstellar disks .",

    "<S> we present submillimeter - array observations of a keplerian disk around the class i protobinary system l1551 ne in 335 ghz continuum emission and submillimeter line emission in @xmath0co ( @xmath1=32 ) and c@xmath2o ( @xmath1=32 ) at a resolution of @xmath3120 @xmath4 80 au . </S>",
    "<S> the 335-ghz dust - continuum image shows a strong central peak closely coincident with the binary protostars and likely corresponding to circumstellar disks , surrounded by a @xmath3600 @xmath4 300 au feature elongated approximately perpendicular to the [ fe ii ] jet from the southern protostellar component suggestive of a circumbinary disk . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0co and c@xmath2o images confirm that the circumbinary continuum feature is indeed a rotating disk ; furthermore , the c@xmath2o channel maps can be well modeled by a geometrically - thin disk exhibiting keplerian rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a mass for the circumbinary disk of @xmath30.03 - 0.12 @xmath5 , compared with an enclosed mass of @xmath30.8 @xmath5 that is dominated by the protobinary system . compared with several other class </S>",
    "<S> i protostars known to exhibit keplerian disks , l1551 ne has the lowest bolometric temperature ( @xmath391 k ) , highest envelope mass ( @xmath30.39 @xmath5 ) , and the lowest ratio in stellar mass to envelope + disk + stellar mass ( @xmath30.65 ) . </S>",
    "<S> l1551 ne may therefore be the youngest protostellar object so far found to exhibit a keplerian disk . </S>",
    "<S> our observations present firm evidence that keplerian disks around binary protostellar systems , `` keplerian circumbinary disks '' , can exist . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that tidal effects from binary companions could transport angular momenta toward the inner edge of the circumbinary disk and create the keplerian circumbinary disk . </S>"
