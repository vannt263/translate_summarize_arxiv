    "there has been interest for some time in the question of whether non - perturbative processes can lead to a difference between the strange and the anti - strange quark distribution functions of the proton .",
    "this possibility was first pointed out by signal and thomas @xcite , and has been subsequently investigated by other authors @xcite .",
    "recently there has been fresh interest in this topic prompted by the measurement of @xmath0 by the nutev collaboration @xcite .",
    "the large difference between the nutev result @xmath2 and the accepted value @xmath3 @xcite of around three standard deviations could arise , or be partly explained by , a positive value of the second moment of the strange - anti - strange distributions @xmath4 $ ] , as has been pointed out by davidson and co - workers @xcite .",
    "as yet there is no direct experimental evidence for any asymmetry in the strange sea , however barone , pascaud and zomer @xcite found that in performing a global fit of unpolarized parton distributions allowing @xmath5 gave a small improvement to the fit .",
    "their best fit result gave the second moment of the asymmetry as @xmath6 at @xmath7 gev@xmath8 .",
    "nutev have also looked for an asymmetry , and found a small negative value for the second moment with a large uncertainty @xcite .",
    "however the functional form of the distributions used for this fit was not constrained to give the first moment to be zero ( i.e. zero net strangeness ) .    the mechanism for breaking the quark - anti - quark symmetry of the strange sea comes from the kaon cloud that accompanies the proton . as shown by sullivan @xcite in the case of the pion cloud",
    ", there is a contribution to the parton distributions of the proton from amplitudes where the virtual photon is scattered from the meson . in this case",
    "the scaling contribution to the parton distribution of the proton can be written as a convolution of the parton distribution of the meson with a fluctuation function that describes the momentum probability distribution of the meson . in a similar vein",
    "there is a contribution to the parton distribution from amplitudes where the virtual photon scatters from the recoil baryon , and the meson is a spectator .",
    "contributions to the strange sea can come from fluctuations such as @xmath9 . in this case",
    "we see that the contribution to the anti - strange distribution , which we denote @xmath10 , comes from the anti - strange quark in the kaon , whereas the contribution to the strange distribution @xmath11 comes from the strange quark in the lambda baryon .",
    "while the valence parton distributions of the kaon and lambda have not been determined by experiment , they can be expected to differ from one another considerably , as the @xmath12 in the kaon carries a larger fraction of the 4-momentum of its parent hadron than that which is carried by the @xmath13 quark in the @xmath14 .",
    "this is certainly the case in comparing the parton distributions of the pion with those of the proton , where the pion valence distributions are harder than the proton valence distributions @xcite .",
    "while the convolution of the meson or baryon valence distribution with the appropriate fluctuation function can be expected to decrease the difference between them , this difference will lead to a difference between the quark and anti - quark distributions in the strange sea of the proton .    in this letter we re -",
    "examine the asymmetry between the strange and anti - strange distributions .",
    "we work within the context of the meson cloud model ( mcm ) @xcite , which describes proton @xmath15 meson + baryon fluctuations using an effective lagrangian , with amplitudes calculated using time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "we consider fluctuations to @xmath16 and @xmath17 in addition to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 fluctuations of the proton . in the non - strange sector",
    ", fluctuations involving pseudovector mesons have been seen to have significant effects on sea distributions @xcite , so we include these fluctuations here to observe whether they make any contribution to the asymmetry of the strange sea .",
    "in the meson cloud model ( mcm ) the nucleon can be viewed as a bare nucleon plus some meson - baryon fock states which result from the fluctuation @xmath20 .",
    "the wavefunction of the nucleon can be written as @xcite , |n_physical = z |n_bare + _ bm _ ^ dy d^2 * k * _ ^^_bm(y , k_^2 ) |b^(y , * k * _ ) ; m^^(1-y,-*k * _ ) [ nmcm ] where @xmath21 is the wave function renormalization constant , @xmath22 is the wave function of the fock state containing a baryon ( @xmath23 ) with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath24 , transverse momentum @xmath25 , and helicity @xmath26 , and a meson ( @xmath27 ) with momentum fraction @xmath28 , transverse momentum @xmath29 , and helicity @xmath30 .",
    "the model assumes that the lifetime of a virtual baryon - meson fock state is much longer than the interaction time in the deep inelastic process , thus the quark and anti - quark in the virtual meson - baryon fock states can contribute to the parton distributions of the nucleon .    for spin independent parton distributions these non - perturbative contributions can be expressed as a convolution of fluctuation functions with the valence parton distributions in the meson and/or baryon . for the strange and anti - strange distributions we have x s(x ) & = & ^1_x dy f_bm / n ( y ) s_b ( ) , + x ( x ) & = & ^1_x dy f_mb / n ( y ) _ m ( ) [ xqbar ] where f_bm / n ( y ) & = & _ ^ ^_0 d",
    "k_^2 ^^_bm(y , k_^2 ) ^*^_bm(y , k_^2 ) , + f_mb / n(y ) & = & f_bm / n ( 1-y ) [ ff ] are the fluctuation functions .",
    "these are the probabilities to find the baryon or meson respectively with fraction @xmath24 of the longitudinal momentum .",
    "we note that the relation ( [ ff ] ) ensures that while the shapes of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are different , their integrals are equal , ensuring that the strangeness of the dressed nucleon is not changed from that of the bare nucleon .",
    "the fluctuation functions are derived from effective meson - nucleon lagrangians @xcite _",
    "nhk&=&i g_nhk |n_5h + l_nhv&=&g_nhv |n _ ^h + f_nhv |n _ h ( ^^-^^ ) [ langragians ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are spin-1/2 fields , @xmath35 a pseudoscalar field , and @xmath36 a vector field . the fluctuations that we consider are @xmath37 .",
    "the coupling constants that we use are @xcite , g_nk & = & -13.98 , + g_nk & = & 2.69 , + g_nk^ * = -5.63 , & & f_nk^ * = -4.89  gev^-1 , + g_nk^ * = -3.25 , & & f_nk^ * = 2.09  gev^-1 .",
    "[ couplingconstant ] the meson - baryon vertices require form factors , which reflect the fact that the hadrons have finite size , and act to suppress large momenta .",
    "we use exponential form factors g_mb(y , k_^2)=exp , though monopole or dipole form factors could also be used with no significant difference to our results . here",
    "@xmath38 is a cut - off parameter , which appears to be the same for fluctuations involving octet baryons and has a value of 1.08 gev , consistent with data on @xmath14 production in semi - inclusive @xmath39-@xmath39 scattering @xcite .",
    "also @xmath40 is the invariant mass squared of the @xmath41 fock state , m_bm^2(y , k_^2)= + .    in figure 1",
    "we show the four fluctuation functions of interest @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath24 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the baryon .",
    "we note that the kaon fluctuation functions peak around @xmath46 , whereas the @xmath1 fluctuation functions peak around @xmath47 and are fairly symmetrical about the peak , indicating that the meson and baryon share the proton momentum equally .",
    "we also note that the @xmath1 fluctuation functions are of similar size to the kaon fluctuation functions .",
    "thus the higher mass of the @xmath1 does not lead to a suppression of these fluctuations , as might be expected on kinematic grounds , but to a smaller average meson momentum .",
    "in fact the least probable fluctuation is @xmath48 , which is suppressed mainly due to the smaller coupling constant .",
    "we can conclude that any analysis of strange quark or anti - quarks in the meson cloud model needs to include the fluctuations involving the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the fluctuation functions depend upon the hardness of the form factor that is used . using a softer form factor",
    "( e.g. @xmath49 gev as suggested by reference @xcite ) does not change the position of the peaks of the fluctuation functions , but does decreases their size .",
    "the higher mass fluctuations involving @xmath1 mesons are more sensitive to the value of @xmath38 , and decrease in size faster as @xmath38 decreases .",
    "the first moment of a fluctuation function gives the probability of that particular fluctuation occuring .",
    "for @xmath50 gev we find the total probabilities of finding a kaon or @xmath1 to be @xmath51 , @xmath52 , whereas for @xmath53 gev these probabilities reduce to @xmath54 , @xmath55 .    in order to calculate the mcm contributions @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eqn .",
    "( [ xqbar ] ) we need to know the parton distributions of the @xmath14 and @xmath56 baryons and the @xmath57 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "previous studies @xcite in the mcm have used @xmath58 flavour symmetry to relate these parton distributions to those of the proton and pion .",
    "however @xmath58 flavour symmetry is known to be broken in the sea distributions of the proton , so it may not be a good approximation to assume that it holds for the valence distributions of octet baryons or the pseudoscalar or pseudovector nonet mesons .",
    "a phenomenological parameterization of the kaon distributions , based on those of the pion , is available @xcite , but there is nothing similar for the baryons .",
    "an alternative is to use some model of the required distributions .",
    "one possibility would be to use a gaussian light - cone wavefunction to calculate the parton distributions , which is an approach used by brodsky and ma @xcite .",
    "another approach is to generalise the calculations of the parton distribution functions of the nucleon in the mit bag model by the adelaide group @xcite .",
    "this has been done in the case of baryon distributions by boros and thomas @xcite , and also in the case of the @xmath59 meson by ourselves @xcite .    adapting the argument of the adelaide group",
    ", we have the expressions for the strange quark distribution of a baryon and the anti - strange quark distribution of a meson : s_b(x ) = d*p*_n ( m_b(1-x ) - p_n^+ )    _ m(x ) = d*p*_n ( m_m(1-x ) - p_n^+ ) |_+,s(*p*_n)|^2 . [ mitpdf ] here we have defined @xmath60 components of momenta by @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the 3-momentum of the 2(1)-quark intermediate state , @xmath63 is the fourier transform of the mit bag wavefunction for the @xmath13 quark ( anti - quark ) in the ground state , and @xmath64 is the fourier transform of the hill - wheeler overlap function between @xmath65-quark bag states |_m(*p*)|^2 = d*r * e^-i*p r * ^m .",
    "the input parameters for the bag model calculations of the parton distributions are the bag radius @xmath66 , the mass of the intermediate state @xmath67 , the mass of the strange quark ( anti - quark ) @xmath68 and the bag scale @xmath69 - at this scale the model is taken as a good approximation to ther valence structure of the hadron . for the baryons ( @xmath14 , @xmath56 ) we use the same parameter set as boros and thomas @xcite ( @xmath70 fm , @xmath71 mev before hyperfine splitting of scalar ( for @xmath14 ) and vector ( for @xmath56 ) states , @xmath72 mev , @xmath73 gev@xmath8 ) . for the mesons ( @xmath57 , @xmath1 ) we use a parameter set based on the baryon set and our earlier @xmath59 meson calculation @xcite ( @xmath74 fm , @xmath75 mev , @xmath72 mev , @xmath73 gev@xmath8 ) .    the valence distributions calculated using eqn .",
    "( [ mitpdf ] ) do not satisfy the straightforward normalisation condition as they ignore intermediate states with more quarks and anti - quarks than the initial state , ie .",
    "3 quarks plus one anti - quark for the baryon distribution , or 2 quarks plus one anti - quark for the meson distribution .",
    "we can parameterise the effects of such states by adding to the distributions a piece proportional to @xmath76 for the baryon distributions or @xmath77 for the meson distributions , consistent with the drell - yan - west relation , such that the normalisation condition is satisfied . while this ansatz for the shape is somewhat arbitrary , it has little effect at medium and large @xmath78 , especially after the distributions",
    "are evolved up to experimental scales . from the calculated fluctuation functions",
    ", we can see that the convolution ( equation ( [ xqbar ] ) ) is most sensitive to parton distributions in the medium and large @xmath78 regions , which are little affected by our ansatz for the contributions from intermediate states with larger mass than the parent hadron . in figure 2 we show the calculated parton distributions after nlo evolution to @xmath79  gev@xmath80 , which is the region of the nutev data .",
    "we can see that the valance distributions of the @xmath57 and @xmath81 mesons are harder than that of the @xmath14 and @xmath56 baryons , as expected .",
    "having calculated both the mcm fluctuation functions and the strange valence parton distributions of the constituents of the cloud we can now calculate the mcm contribution to the proton @xmath13 and @xmath12 distributions using the convolution in equation ( [ xqbar ] ) . in figure 3",
    "we show our calculated difference between strange and anti - strange parton distributions using @xmath82 gev .",
    "we show the difference calculated with and without including the contributions from fock states involving @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we can see that the contributions from @xmath16 and @xmath17 are of similar magnitude to those from the lower mass fock states .",
    "as has been noted before @xcite , the mcm gives a small ( @xmath83 ) difference because the harder of the parton distributions ( @xmath84 ) is convoluted with the softer of the fluctuation functions ( @xmath85 ) , whereas the the softer parton distribution ( @xmath86 ) is convoluted with the harder fluctuation function ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "this leads to similar results for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the non - perturbative contributions to the parton distributions .",
    "when @xmath1 states are considered , we see from figure 1 that @xmath88 , so each fluctuation function gives equal emphasis to the medium - large @xmath78 region of the hadron parton distributions when they are convoluted together .",
    "thus the relative hardness of @xmath89 to @xmath86 is manifested in the large @xmath78 region as @xmath90 in the calculation .",
    "we calculate the second moment of the strange - anti - strange asymmetry both with and without @xmath1 contributions .",
    "we find that _",
    "0 ^ 1 dx x(s(x ) - ( x ) ) = \\ {    cc 1.43 10 ^ -4 &   + -1.35 10 ^ -4 &  .    .",
    "we observe that omitting fluctuations involving @xmath1 mesons changes the sign of the second moment of the asymmetry , so it is important that these fluctuations are included in any discussion of the asymmetry of the strange sea .",
    "because the calculated asymmetry depends on the difference between mcm contrributions to parton distributions , it is relatively insensitive to changes in the form factor used to calculate the mcm fluctuation functions .",
    "if we had used the form factor parameter @xmath53 gev instead of @xmath50 gev , we would have obtained values of @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) for the second moments of the asymmetry without ( with ) @xmath1 fluctuations .",
    "the non - zero value of the strange sea asymmetry affects the experimentally determined value of the paschos - wolfenstein ratio r_pw = = g_l^2 - g_r^2 = - ^2_w .",
    "the effect of the strange sea asymmetry is to shift @xmath93 by an amount @xcite r_pw = - x(s-|s)[pwr ] where b_1 = _",
    "u^2 = g_l_u^2 - g_r_u^2 ; b_2 = _",
    "d^2 = g_l_d^2 - g_r_d^2 . at the nutev scale ( @xmath94 gev@xmath8 ) the coefficient in front of the second moment of the stange sea asymmetry in equation ( [ pwr ] ) is about 1.3 , which means that @xmath95 is of the order @xmath96 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude too small to have any significant effect on the nutev result for the weak mixing angle .",
    "any asymmetry between strange quarks and anti - quarks in the nucleon sea must arise from non - perturbative effects .",
    "this would make any experimental observation of a strange sea asymmetry a crucial test for models of nucleon structure .",
    "we have re - examined this asymmetry within the context of the meson cloud model , which gives an asymmetry from strange hadrons in the meson cloud of the proton .",
    "a novel aspect of our calculation is that we have included the effects of components of the meson cloud involving the @xmath1 vector meson , and we have seen that the contributions to the strange sea from these components are of similar magnitude to those involving the pseudoscalar kaon .",
    "hence any qualitative discussion of the strange sea in the mcm requires that both sets of contributions are considered .",
    "overall we have found that the strange sea asymmetry in the mcm is fairly small , and does not have significant effect on the nutev extraction of @xmath0 .",
    "however we have also seen that the sign of the second moment of the asymmetry depends on which contributions are considered .",
