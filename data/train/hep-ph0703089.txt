    "it is of great importance to understand semileptonic decays of kaons ( @xmath0 ) , since it plays a significant role in determining the ckm matrix element @xmath4 precisely  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it provides a simple phenomenological basis for testing the breaking of flavor su(3 ) symmetry : in exact flavor su(3 ) symmetry , the kaon semileptonic form factor @xmath5 becomes unity .",
    "the ademollo - gatto  @xcite theorem asserts that of second order are the corrections of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking to the form factors of vector currents at zero momentum transfer ( @xmath6 ) . however ,",
    "when goldstone bosons are involved , the ademollo - gatto theorem must be modified : while the singlet part of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking preserves flavor su(3 ) symmetry , it breaks chiral su(3)@xmath7su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "langacker and pagels showed that the corrections of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking appear to first order due to the presence of that singlet part  @xcite .",
    "the effect of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking on the kaon semileptonic decay form factor is known to be around @xmath8 , which is rather small .    the well - known soft - pion callan - treiman  @xcite theorem connects the ratio of the pion and kaon decay constants to the semileptonic form factors of the kaon at @xmath9 ( callan - treiman point ) .",
    "any chiral quark model should satisfy the callan - treiman theorem with flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking . experimentally , there are a certain amount of data to judge theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "thus , the kaon semileptonic decay form factor provides a basis to examine the validity and reliability of any theoretical theory and model for hadrons .",
    "there has been a great number of theoretical work : chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1pt )  @xcite , lattice qcd ( lqcd )  @xcite , a dyson - schwinger method  @xcite , constituent quark models  @xcite , and so on . in the present work",
    ", we will investigate the @xmath0 form factor within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model ( @xmath1qm ) derived from the instanton vacuum .",
    "we will consider the leading order in the large @xmath10 expansion and flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking explicitly .",
    "the meson - loop corrections , which are of @xmath11 order , are neglected .",
    "the model has several virtues : all relevant qcd symmetries are satisfied within the model , and there are only two parameters : the average size of instantons ( @xmath2 fm ) and average inter - instanton distance ( @xmath3 fm ) , which can be determined by the internal constraint such as the saddle - point equation  @xcite .",
    "these values for @xmath12 and @xmath13 have been supported in various lqcd simulations recently  @xcite .",
    "there is no further adjustable parameter in the model .    as being discussed previously , since the effects of flavor su(3 ) symmetry",
    "breaking are essential in the present work , we employ the modified low - energy effective partition function with flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "this partition function extends the former one derived in the chiral limit  @xcite .",
    "it has been proven that the partition function with flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking is very successful in describing the low - energy hadronic properties such as various qcd condensates , magnetic susceptibilities , meson distribution amplitudes , and so on  @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of the nonlocal interaction between quarks and pseudo - goldstone bosons breaks the ward - takahashi identity for nther currents .",
    "since the kaon semileptonic decay form factors involve the vector current , we need to deal with this problem . while ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a systematic way as to how the conservation of the nther current is restored , one has to handle the integral equation .",
    "@xcite derived the light - quark partition function in the presence of the external gauge fields . with this gauged partition function",
    ", it was shown that the low - energy theorem for the transition from two - photon state to the vacuum via the axial anomaly was satisfied  @xcite . moreover , the magnetic susceptibility of the qcd vacuum and the meson distribution amplitudes were obtained sucessfully  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present work , we will investigate the kaon semileptonic decay ( @xmath0 ) form factors , using the gauged low - energy effective partition function from the instanton vacuum with flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking explicitly taken into account .",
    "we sketch the present work as follows : in section ii , we briefly explain the general formalism relevant for studying the @xmath0 form factor . in section iii , we introduce the nonlocal chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum . in section iv ,",

    "<S> we investigate the kaon semileptonic decay ( @xmath0 ) form factors within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model ( @xmath1qm ) from the instanton vacuum , taking into account the effects of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the problem of gauge invariance arising from the momentum - dependent quark mass in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> all theoretical calculations are carried out without any adjustable parameter , the average instanton size ( @xmath2 fm ) and the inter - instanton distance ( @xmath3 fm ) having been fixed . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the present results satisfy the callan - treiman low - energy theorem as well as the ademollo - gatto theorem . using the @xmath0 form factors , we evaluate relevant physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the effects of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking are essential in reproducing the kaon semileptonic form factors . </S>",
    "<S> the present results are in a good agreement with experiments , and are compatible with other model calculations . </S>"
