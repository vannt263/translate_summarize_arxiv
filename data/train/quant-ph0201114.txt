    "quantum mechanical entanglement and nonlocality are the inherent features of microworld having many practical applications in quantum information processing and communication @xcite .",
    "the quantum information protocols developed originally in the context of qubit systems have been successfully extended to continuous - variable ( cv ) domain @xcite .",
    "recently , both cv analogues of bb84 and ekert s quantum cryptography @xcite protocols have been suggested @xcite . in experimental implementations of cv quantum cryptography protocols with entangled states the two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the mean number of signal photons ( @xmath3 is the squeezing parameter ) , commonly serves as a quantum channel .",
    "this state ( [ rhonopa ] ) can be generated either by using nondegenerate parametric amplifier ( nopa ) @xcite or by mixing two independent single - mode squeezed fields at a beam splitter ( or in fiber coupler ) @xcite .",
    "the quantum key distribution goes as follows .",
    "the nopa source emits two fields : one is distributed to alice ( a ) and the other propagates towards bob ( b ) .",
    "alice and bob randomly select to measure one of two conjugate field quadrature amplitudes @xmath4 , @xmath5 and , as the squeezing parameter @xmath3 increases , the correlation ( anticorelation ) between the results of the same quadrature measurements on alice s and bob s side grows . communicating their choices of the measurements through a public classical channel and keeping only the results",
    "when both of them measured the same quadrature the key is established between alice and bob .    in reality ,",
    "transfer of the entanglement between two distant partners , usually realized by means of optical fibers , suffers by undesirable losses which strongly reduce the amount of the entanglement .",
    "these losses can be induced either by the fiber imperfections or they can be introduced deliberately by an eavesdropper eve ( e ) .",
    "if the losses are modelled by reservoir at zero temperature , one can show that the entanglement of the state ( [ rhonopa ] ) does not vanish completely for any extinction coefficient of fibers @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonlocal correlations between communicating parties alice and bob guarantee the security against the individual attacks @xcite .",
    "we employ a cv analogue of this statement and assume that quantum channel has a sufficient quality if it preserves the nonlocality of distributed nopa states .",
    "thus , knowing the fiber link transmitivity , one can judge its convenience before experimental implementation .    in practice",
    ", it might be based on the bell inequalities @xcite for cv systems @xcite .",
    "the nonlocality of the two - mode squeezed state under damping is deteriorated as has been recently demonstrated utilizing the banaszek - w ' odkiewicz inequality @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , it was shown that for fixed fiber losses the larger the initial squeezing is the more rapidly the nonlocality is degraded irrespective of the entanglement preservation . in this report",
    ", we investigate the nonlocality of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state in vacuum environment employing more appropriate chsh bell inequalities than those used in @xcite . by introducing",
    "the `` spin-1/2 '' operators in infinite - dimensional hilbert space one obtains the two - qubit form of the cv bell inequalities @xcite to which the horodecki s nonlocality criterion @xcite can be directly applied .",
    "this procedure is shown to be more efficient to test the nopa state nonlocality even when the local losses are involved . in the absence of losses the maximal bell factor rapidly converges to maximal value @xmath6 with increasing squeezing parameter @xmath3 .",
    "if the losses are involved , then we confirm the qualitative statement that the stronger initial squeezing induces more rapid nonlocality degradation @xcite .",
    "however , it is proved that the transmitted nopa state does not admit a local realistic description for much more pronounced losses than it has been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "this fact is important for secure long - distance quantum communication based on the shared two - mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "we consider a lossy two - line optical - fiber transmission channel injected by the nopa state ( [ rhonopa ] ) .",
    "simulating the losses by markovian reservoir at zero temperature and eliminating free oscillations the evolution of the nopa state can be effectively described by the following standard master equation for the density matrix @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are damping constants and @xmath10 are annihilation and creation operators of modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "equivalently , the following nonunitary evolution can induce an eavesdropper eve by mixing the modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 with vacua at two beam splitters with reflectivities @xmath13 , @xmath14 . solving the equation ( [ master ] ) for initial nopa state ( [ rhonopa ] )",
    "one finds the following solution @xmath15 note that if the losses are introduced only on the bob s side ( @xmath16 ) , the ( a , e ) state can be obtained from the state ( [ rho ] ) by exchanges @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    to turn the infinite dimensional nonlocality problem into the two - qubit problem",
    ", one can simply introduce the following single - mode realization of the pauli matrices @xcite @xmath19 satisfying the pauli matrix algebra @xmath20=2i\\varepsilon_{ijk } s_{k},\\quad(s_i)^{2}=1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is the totally antisymmetric tensor with @xmath23 . due to the commutation rules ( [ commut ] )",
    ", the nonlocality of our state ( [ rho ] ) can be investigated by means of the standard two - qubit chsh bell inequalities in which the pauli matrices are replaced by the operators ( [ smatrix ] ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are unit vectors in the real three - dimensional space and the angle brackets denote the averaging over the matrix @xmath29 .",
    "now , according to the horodecki nonlocality criterion @xcite , if @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are two greater eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath33 ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 stands for the transposition ) , then the density matrix ( [ rho ] ) violates the inequalities ( [ bell ] ) for some vectors @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    employing ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ smatrix ] ) one finds after some algebra , that the matrix @xmath36 is diagonal with two - fold eigenvalue @xmath37 and single eigenvalue @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40}{m\\choose 2k}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2k+1}}\\left(\\frac{r_{i}}{\\sqrt{1-r_{i}^{2}}}\\right ) ^{2m-4k},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath41 the maximal bell factor then reads @xmath42 in the following we investigate two special cases : ( i ) @xmath43 and ( ii ) @xmath44 .",
    "the first case corresponds to the symmetric location of alice and bob with respect to the source of the nopa state , whereas the second case is connected with asymmetric arrangement , in which bob resides in the close vicinity of the source .    the nonlocality analysis of the transmitted state ( [ rho ] ) is based on the numerical calculation of the value of the maximal bell parameter @xmath45 ( [ bell ] ) .",
    "we confirm the qualitative result of the previous paper @xcite that the rapidity of nonlocality degradation of the nopa state increases with increasing initial squeezing , as can be seen in fig .  1 .",
    "however , there is pronounced difference in the rapidity of the nonlocality destruction in comparison with the result found in @xcite .",
    "our analysis reveals that the nonlocality is preserved even if stronger losses are taken into account . in the following",
    "we perform a quantitative comparison of our results with results obtained in @xcite . if @xmath46 , then the fig .",
    "1 demonstrates that the nonlocality threshold for the _ symmetric _ case ( i ) occurs for @xmath47 in contrast to the threshold value @xmath48 calculated in @xcite . in our analysis the threshold value @xmath48 is achieved for larger squeezing @xmath49 .",
    "better results are obtained in the _ asymmetric _ case ( ii ) .",
    "if @xmath50 , then the threshold is shifted to value @xmath51 as can be seen in fig .  2 .",
    "the dependence of the threshold damping parameter @xmath52 on the squeezing parameter @xmath3 for symmetric and asymmetric setups is depicted in fig .  3 and fig .  4 , respectively .",
    "the inequality @xmath53 represents sufficient condition for nonlocality of the nopa state to be preserved during the transfer through lossy optical fibers .",
    "if the squeezing @xmath3 is sufficiently large @xmath54 , then one can find the following fits for the _ symmetric _ case ( fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath55 and for the _ asymmetric _ case ( fig .",
    "4 ) @xmath56 these approximative rules enable us to check simply the ability of the lossy fiber communication channel to transfer the nonlocality of the nopa state .",
    "the losses can be described by the dimensionless absorption coefficient @xmath57 where @xmath58 is input optical power , @xmath59 is output optical power , @xmath60 is length of the fiber and @xmath61 is the field velocity in the fiber .",
    "according to the results obtained in @xcite the initial squeezing @xmath46 ( @xmath62 ) leads to the following threshold absorption coefficient @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "our analysis gives the following threshold absorption coefficient @xmath64 .",
    "thus , it is important fact for the experimentalist that the nonlocality of the nopa state with @xmath46 is preserved at ten times longer transmission length than it was suggested earlier @xcite . thus the quantum key can be securely distributed even under the influence of stronger losses .",
    "we analyse the nonlocality evolution of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state transferred through symmetric or asymmetric lossy channels .",
    "the nonlocality preservation is important to ensure quality of quantum channel for cv cryptography with entangled states .",
    "we confirm qualitative statement about pronounced nonlocality degradation with increasing initial squeezing for fixed losses .",
    "however , utilizing the stronger nonlocality criterion in the infinite - dimensional hilbert space , we demonstrate the nonlocality preservation in the presence of substantially larger losses , than it was suggested previously .",
    "maximal allowable losses preserving the nonlocality can be approximately expressed by the simple formulas ( [ app1 ] ) and ( [ app2 ] ) , which can be useful for the experimentalist to quickly determine the possibility of nonlocality transfer . the theoretical nonlocality proof presented here is more simple in comparison with the proof based on the generalized banaszek - w ' odkiewicz ( b - w ) version of bell inequalities which requires the numerical maximization in the eight - dimensional space . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear as to measure the spin - like operators ( [ smatrix ] ) experimentally .",
    "thus , our approach is appropriate for theoretical calculations , whereas the generalized b - w inequalities are more suitable for the experimental test of nonlocality .",
    "the authors would like to thank j. fiur ' aek for useful discussions .",
