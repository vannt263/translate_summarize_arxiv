    "the first one is the exchange of a heavy fermionic singlet .",
    "this is the celebrated seesaw mechanism @xcite , which we will call seesaw type - i .",
    "the second possibility is the exchange of a scalar triplet @xcite .",
    "this is commonly known as seesaw type - ii . and",
    "lastly , one could also add one ( or more ) fermionic triplets to the field content of the sm @xcite .",
    "this is called seesaw type - iii in @xcite , although this nomenclature is not universally accepted .    the dimension-5 operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) could also be generated at loop level .",
    "as the classical examples for loop generated neutrino masses we only mention the zee model @xcite ( 1-loop ) and the babu - zee model @xcite ( 2-loop ) , although many more models exist in the literature .",
    "a list of generic 1-loop realizations of eq . ( [ eq : dim5 ] ) can also be found in @xcite .    at `` low '' energies one can neither decide whether tree - level or loop physics generates eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) , nor can any measurements of neutrino angles , phases or masses distinguish between the different tree - level realizations of the seesaw discussed above .",
    "observables outside the neutrino sector are needed to ultimately learn about the origin of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) . for loop",
    "generated neutrino masses , @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) can be a very small number and the scale @xmath3 at which new physics appears can be quite low , probably accessible at future accelerators such as the lhc or an ilc .",
    "the `` classical '' tree - level realizations of the seesaw , unfortunately , can not be put to the test in such a direct way .",
    "this can be straightforwardly understood by inverting eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) , which results in @xmath4 gev .",
    "indirect inside into the high - energy world might be possible in supersymmetric versions of the seesaw . in the renormalization group equations for the soft susy breaking",
    "slepton mass parameters terms proportional to the neutrino yukawa couplings appear . if the scale where the right - handed neutrinos and/or the triplet decouple is below the scale at which susy breaks , lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) entries in the yukawa matrices then induce lfv off - diagonals in the slepton mass matrices .",
    "this effect potentially leads to large values for lepton flavour violating lepton decays , such as @xmath5 , even if the soft masses are completely flavour blind at high scale , as was first pointed out for the case of seesaw type - i in @xcite .",
    "it is maybe not surprising then that with the increasingly convincing experimental evidence for non - zero neutrino masses a number of articles have studied the prospects for observing lfv processes , both at low energies and at future colliders , within the supersymmetric seesaw @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that a minimal seesaw type - ii has fewer free parameters than the seesaw type - i , type - i seesaw has received considerably more attention in the literature .",
    "probably one of the reasons for this preference is gauge coupling unification .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the sm gauge couplings unify within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at a scale around @xmath6 gev , if the susy particles have masses around the electro - weak scale . adding gauge singlets does not destroy this nice feature of the mssm .",
    "however , a scalar triplet with mass below the gut scale changes the running of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in an unwanted way and gauge coupling unification is lost @xcite .",
    "a simple way to cure this defect of the seesaw - ii consists in adding only complete @xmath9 multiplets ( or gut multiplets which can be decomposed into complete @xmath9 multiplets ) to the standard model particle content . in this way",
    "the scale where couplings unify remains the same ( at one loop level ) , only the value of the gut coupling changes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate lepton flavour violating branching ratios of the scalar tau as well as lfv lepton decays at low energies , such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for definiteness , we assume minimal supergravity ( msugra ) boundary conditions and fit the observed neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism of type - ii . we will discuss two different realizations . the first one is based on adding one pair of triplets to the mssm , from which only one couples to the standard model leptons .",
    "this is the simplest supersymmetric version of the type - ii seesaw .",
    "the second model we consider consists in adding a pair of @xmath12 and @xmath13 multiplets to the mssm particle content @xcite .",
    "this second option allows to maintain gauge coupling unification also for @xmath14 .",
    "we compare the sensitivities of low - energy and accelerator measurements and study their dependence on the unknown seesaw and susy parameters .",
    "absolute values of lfv stau decays and lfv lepton decays depend very differently on the unknown susy parameters . for a light susy spectrum ,",
    "say slepton masses below 200 gev , the current upper bound on br(@xmath15 ) limits seriously the possibility to observe lfv scalar tau decays",
    ". however , for heavier sparticles low energy data very rapidly looses its constraining power and large lfv at the lhc is allowed by current data .",
    "while absolute values of lfv observables depend very strongly on the soft susy breaking parameters , we discuss how ratios of lfv branching ratios can be used to eliminate most of the dependence on the unknown susy spectrum .",
    "i.e.  ratios such as , for example , br(@xmath16)/br(@xmath17 ) are constants for fixed neutrino parameters over large parts of the supersymmetric parameter space",
    ". measurements of such ratios would allow to extract valuable information about the seesaw parameters : in the minimal type - ii seesaw case these ratios can be calculated as function of measurable low - energy neutrino data . for the more involved case of the @xmath18 model this simple connection is lost in general , but relations to neutrino data can be ( re- ) established in some simple , extreme cases for the yukawa matrix @xmath19 .",
    "we therefore study such ratios in some detail , first analytically then numerically .    the presence of new non - singlet states below the gut scale does not only affect the running of gauge couplings but also the evolution of the soft susy breaking parameters",
    ". measurements of soft susy masses at the lhc and at a possible ilc therefore contain indirect information about the physics at higher energy scales @xcite .",
    "> from the different soft scalar and gaugino masses one can define certain `` invariants '' , i.e. parameter combinations which are nearly constant over large ranges of the msugra parameter space @xcite , at least in leading order approximation .",
    "if the measured values of all the invariants depart from the msugra expectation in a consistent way , one could gain some indirect estimate of the mass scale of the new particles , the scale of the seesaw type - ii .",
    "we discuss first some leading order analytical approximation , before showing by numerical calculation the limitations of the simplified analytical approach .",
    "while the different invariants indeed contain useful information about the high energy physics , reliable quantitative conclusions about the mass scale of the @xmath12 require highly precise measurements of soft masses as well as a full numerical 2-loop analysis .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will recall the basic features of the supersymmetric seesaw type - ii and discuss a @xmath9 motivated variant , which adds a pair of @xmath12 and @xmath20 .",
    "section [ sec : ana ] then discusses analytical solutions for the rges and presents estimates for slepton mixing angles and the corresponding lfv observables . in section [ sec",
    ": num ] we present our numerical results for lfv decays at low energies and accelerators .",
    "this numerical study demonstrates the reliability of our analytical approximations for the lfv observables .",
    "we then discuss soft masses and the seesaw type - ii scale , demonstrating by a numerically exact calculation that for soft masses the leading order approximations are not accurate enough to draw quantitative conclusions .",
    "we then summarize in section [ sec : cncl ] .",
    "in this section , to set up the notation , we briefly recall the main features of the seesaw type - ii and msugra .",
    "we then outline a simple @xmath9 motivated model based on the work of @xcite .      in supersymmetry at least two @xmath21 triplet states @xmath22 with opposite hypercharge",
    "are needed to cancel anomalies .",
    "thus , the minimal susy potential including triplets can be written as @xmath23 here @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are supermultiplets with hypercharge @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 are the standard higgs doublets with @xmath29 .",
    "the matrix @xmath30 is complex symmetric , @xmath31 are arbitrary constants and @xmath32 gives mass to the triplets , supposedly at a very high scale .",
    "note that only @xmath24 couples to the sm leptons , thus in the minimal ( supersymmetric ) model with two triplets the only source of lepton flavour violation resides in the matrix @xmath30 .    integrating out the heavy triplets at their mass scale the dimension-5 operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dim5 ] ) is generated and after electro - weak symmetry breaking the resulting neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the vacuum expectation value of higgs doublet @xmath35 and we use the convention @xmath36 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssii ] ) depends on the energy scale .",
    "@xmath37 is measured at low energies , whereas for the calculation of @xmath37 we need to know @xmath38 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 as input paramters at the high scale .",
    "one can use an iterative procedure to find the high scale parameters from the low energy measured quantities , as explained in section [ sec : num ] . in the basis where the charged lepton masses are diagonal , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssii ] ) is diagonalized by @xmath39 where the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath40 is , in standard notation @xcite , given by @xmath41 here @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "for majorana neutrinos , @xmath40 contains three phases : @xmath44 is the ( dirac- ) cp violating phase , which appears in neutrino oscillations , and @xmath45 are majorana phases , which can only be observed in lepton number violating processes .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments can be fitted with either a normal hierarchical spectrum ( nh ) , or with inverted hierarchy ( ih ) .",
    "if one does not insist in ordering the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath46 , @xmath47 with respect to increasing mass , the matrix @xmath40 can describe both possibilities without re - ordering of angles . in this convention , which we will use in the following",
    ", @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) corresponds to normal ( inverse ) hierarchy and @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the solar ( @xmath53 ) , reactor ( @xmath54 ) and atmosperic angle ( @xmath55 ) for both type of spectra .",
    "note that @xmath56 i.e. @xmath30 is diagonalized by _ the same matrix as @xmath57_. if all neutrino eigenvalues , angles and phases were known , @xmath30 would be fixed up to an overall constant which can be easily estimated to be @xmath58 at this points it might be worth recalling the main differences between seesaw type - ii and seesaw type - i . in seesaw type - i",
    "there is one non - zero mass eigenstate for the light neutrinos for each right - handed neutrino added to the model .",
    "in contrast , seesaw - ii can produce three non - zero neutrino masses with only one triplet .",
    "thus the minimal model for seesaw type - ii with only one triplet coupling to @xmath59 has less parameters than seesaw type - i .",
    "we can count the new parameters in eq .",
    "( [ triplet_pot ] ) : @xmath30 being complex symmetric has 9 parameters .",
    "additionally we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "all three could in principle be complex .",
    "however , field redefinitions on @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be applied to remove two of the three phases , thus there is a a total of 13 parameters .",
    "note , however , that only 11 of them are related to neutrino physics .",
    "since we have the freedom to write down eq .",
    "( [ triplet_pot ] ) in the basis , where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , we only have to add three charged lepton masses to the counting of free parameters . , with @xmath60 having dimension of mass ,",
    "but the number of parameters related with neutrino physics does not change . ] this number should be compared to the 21 free parameters in seesaw type - i for three right - handed neutrinos @xcite . at low energies",
    "a maximum of 12 parameters can be fixed by measuring lepton properties : 3 neutrino and 3 charged lepton masses , 3 angles and 3 phases .",
    "thus from neutrino data neither seesaw type - ii nor seesaw type - i can be completely reconstructed .",
    "however , especially important in the following is the fact , see eq .",
    "( [ diagyt ] ) , that low - energy neutrino angles are directly related to the high - energy yukawa matrix in seesaw - ii , whereas no such simple connection exists in the seesaw type - i , see also the discussion in @xcite .      in this section",
    "we outline the basics of an @xmath9 inspired model , which adds a pair of @xmath12 and @xmath20 to the mssm particle spectrum @xcite .",

    "as long as @xmath79 gauge coupling unification will be mantained .",
    "the equality need not be exact for successful unification . in our numerical studies",
    "we have taken into account the different running of these mass parameters but we decouple them all at the scale @xmath80 because the differences are small .",

    "these values serve to indicate the allowed variations for @xmath102 due to other parameters than @xmath51 .",
    "as stated above , the allowed variation on @xmath51 is most important for the `` uncertainties '' in @xmath99 .",
    "however , also the current error bar on @xmath103 leads to a sizeable variation on @xmath102 .",
    "since @xmath104 and @xmath105 are now known to much better precision than the neutrino angles , their variation is much less important for the @xmath99 , as table ( [ tab:1 ] ) demonstrates .    finally , recall that all results presented in this subsection are based on the assumption that one of the extreme cases , @xmath106 or @xmath107 , is realized .",
    "the former corresponds to the su(5 ) inspired model with a complete @xmath12 of section ( [ sec : su5 ] ) , whereas the latter corresponds to the simplest triplet - only model discussed in section ( [ sec : triplet ] ) .",
    "however , we stress that departures in the ratios of lfv branching ratios from the values calculated in this subsection should not be interpreted as `` ruling out '' the seesaw type - ii .",
    "rather they should be interpreted in the sense that one has to go beyond minimal scenarios .",
    "in this section we present our numerical calculations .",
    "all results presented below have been obtained with the lepton flavour violating version of the program package spheno @xcite .",
    "calculations are done for the 15-plet case , using the assumption @xmath106 at @xmath93 , as discussed above . unless mentioned otherwise , we fit neutrino mass squared differences to their best fit values @xcite and the angle to tbm values .",
    "our numerical procedure is as follows .",
    "inverting the seesaw equation , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ssii ] ) , one can get a first guess of the yukawa couplings for any fixed values of the light neutrino masses ( and angles ) as a function of the corresponding triplet mass for any fixed value of @xmath38 .",
    "this first guess will not give the correct yukawa couplings , since the neutrino masses and mixing angles are measured at low energy , whereas for the calculation of @xmath37 we need to insert the parameters at the high energy scale .",
    "however , we can use this first guess to run numerically the rges to obtain the exact neutrino masses and angles ( at low energies ) for these input parameters .",
    "the difference between the results obtained numerically and the input numbers can then be minimized in a simple iterative procedure until convergence is achieved . as long as neutrino yukawas are not too close to one we reach convergence in a few steps . however , in seesaw type - ii the yukawas run stronger than in seesaw type - i , thus our initial guess can deviate sizeably from the exact yukawas . since neutrino data requires at least one neutrino mass to be larger than about @xmath108 ev , we do not find any solutions for @xmath109 gev .",
    "we have implemented the effects of the additional triplets ( 15-plets ) including the two - loop contributions to the rges for gauge couplings and gaugino masses , one - loop contributions to the remaining mssm parameters and one - loop rges for the new parameters in spheno . for consistency",
    "we have also included 1-loop threshold corrections for gauge couplings and gaugino mass parameters at the scale corresponding to the mass of the triplet .",
    "the mssm part is implemented at the 2-loop level and , thus , in principle one should also include the effect of the 15-plets consistently for all parameters at this level .",
    "however , the correct fit of the neutrino data require that either the triplet ( 15-plet ) yukawa couplings are small and/or that @xmath32 is close to @xmath93 implying that the ratio @xmath110 is significantly smaller than @xmath111 and thus one expects only small effects .      the analytical results presented in the previous section allow to estimate ratios of branching ratios for lfv decays . for absolute values of the branching ratios , as well as for cross - checking the reliability of the analytical estimates ,",

    "we have checked by an exact numerical calculation that the other invariants shown in section ( [ sec : ana ] ) suffer from similar changes when going from 1-loop order to 2-loop . in other words , if one wants to learn about the seesaw scale from measurements of the soft masses , a careful analysis at 2-loop order will be necessary .",
    "also note that , due to the logarithmic dependence on @xmath32 , highly precise measurements will be necessary , especially if @xmath32 is large , say @xmath134 gev .",
    " invariant  @xmath130 calculated with yukawa couplings fitted to neutrino data , for an arbitrary choice of @xmath135 .",
    "the calculation uses 2-loop rges .",

    "( [ fig : compyuk ] ) shows @xmath130 calculated with yukawa couplings fitted to neutrino data , for an arbitrary choice of @xmath135 .",
    "the calculation uses 2-loop rges and results are shown again for the msugra standard points sps1a and sps3 .",
    "for @xmath32 low , say @xmath136 gev or so in this example , yukawa couplings which explain current neutrino data are too small to induce any significant effect in the determination of @xmath130 .    however , for larger values of @xmath32 sizeable differences between fig .",
    "( [ fig : comp ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig : compyuk ] ) show up .",
    "first of all , for negligibly small yukawas the calculation can vary @xmath32 freely up to the gut scale . if instead we insist to fit neutrino masses , such large values for @xmath32 are not allowed .",
    "the downward turn in @xmath130 is due to yukawas , which if larger than @xmath137 contribute sizeable in the running of the soft parameters . in the example shown in this figure",
    "@xmath135 has been chosen . for smaller values of @xmath38",
    "again for fixed values of the yukawa couplings to fit neutrino masses a lower @xmath32 is required .",
    "correspondingly , for smaller @xmath38 the effect of the yukawas is seen for smaller values of @xmath32 .    it is also found that slepton mass parameters of the first and second generation run differently for large values of @xmath32 , see fig .",
    "( [ fig : compyuk ] ) .",
    "this difference can be traced to the fact that we have fitted neutrino angles to take exact tbm values . in this limit , @xmath138 , while @xmath139 .",
    "thus , at the largest values of @xmath32 sizeable mass differences between 1st and 2nd generation sleptons show up .",
    "this difference is expected to be smaller for non - zero values of @xmath51 .",
    "note , however , that for the example points shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : compyuk ] ) , there is the upper limit on @xmath32 from @xmath121 , discussed in the last subsection . for sps1a @xmath140 gev , for sps3 @xmath141 gev .",
    "this limits the range of @xmath32 where differences between 1st and 2nd generation slepton masses might be observable .",
    "we mention that a recent paper @xcite claims that mass differences between smuons and selectrons can be measured very accurately , even at the lhc . depending on the msugra point @xmath142 as small as @xmath143 might be measurable @xcite provided the leptons have sufficient energy to pass the experimental cuts .",
    "branching ratios for lfv decays versus @xmath130 for sps3 for two different values of @xmath38 . measuring both types of observables allow in principle to disentangle @xmath38 and @xmath32.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=188 ] -5 mm    all observables discussed so far are sensitive only to a combination of @xmath32 and @xmath38 .",
    "if , however , both lfv decays as well as @xmath130 could be measured in the future , one could disentangle the two parameters , in principle , by combining both measurements .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : lfvvinv ] ) , which shows lfv decays , @xmath123 and @xmath127 versus @xmath130 , for two different values of @xmath38 .",
    "note again that the `` dip '' in @xmath123 is due to a level - crossing of selectron and smuon mass eigenstates .",
    "however , again we warn that a full 2-loop calculation is needed , before any quantitative conclusions could be drawn from such a measurement .",
    "we have studied phenomenological implications of the supersymmetric version of the type - ii seesaw within msugra .",
    "we have calculated lepton flavour violating observables , such as @xmath115 and lfv scalar tau decays .",
    "we have found branching ratios for lfv violating stau decays are large enough to be detectable at the lhc in principle .",
    "we have pointed out that in the simplest case of only one triplet coupling to the sm leptons , ratios of lfv branching ratios can be calculated from low energy neutrino data only . however , for the case of a complete @xmath12 multiplet the situation is not as straightforward . in the su(5 ) inspired model the yukawa couplings @xmath30 and @xmath76 are related to the @xmath144 and the conclusions remain unchanged . however , allowing @xmath30 and @xmath76 to be free parameters , the relation with neutrino physics is lost .",
    "thus , seesaw type - ii can not be ruled out by any lfv measurements in general .",
    "instead measuring ratios of lfv branching ratios can be understood as a consistency check for the minimal seesaw type - ii models .",
    "we have also calculated the soft masses as a function of the seesaw parameters .",
    "as discussed in some detail , there are certain combinations of soft masses , which are approximately constants over large regions of msugra space .",
    "these `` invariants '' contain indirect information about the seesaw scale .",
    "measuring susy masses as precisely as possible will therefore allow to constrain the scale of seesaw type - ii indirectly .",
    "however , theoretically there are many possibilities , why any single of the `` invariants '' we discussed could depart from the simplest msugra expectations .",
    "only a consistent departure of several `` invariants '' , together with measurements of lfv processes , could therefore be taken as a hint for seesaw type - ii .",
