    "accretion is the main source of energy for a wide variety of astrophysical objects , from pre - main sequence stars through white dwarf , neutron star and black hole binaries up to supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies .",
    "the matter in accretion disks in these systems gradually moves towards the compact object , extracts gravitational energy and produce broad band emission spectra . in spite of general understanding of formation of emission in accretion disks ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and temperature distributions over the disk ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the very fact that the matter travels outside - in is not an easy thing to verify even though it is essential for the whole accretion process .",
    "virtually the only way to verify this movement of the matter in the accretion flow is to study the time variability of its emission at different parts of the flow ( except for , may be , the radial velocity component of the emission lines ) .",
    "indeed , matter travels from the outer parts of the accretion flow towards the central compact object and thus any time variations of the mass tranfer rate in the flow should be transported inwards ( though with possible smearing due to influence of viscosity ) .",
    "this idea together with the assumption that all accretion flow radii generate their own additional noise at characteristic frequencies , corresponding to their dynamical times is an essense of the _ model of propagating fluctuations _ ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the shortest time scales in this model are introduced at the smallest radii , the largest time scales are introduced at outer parts of the accretion disks .",
    "the inner parts of the disk add their noise to the mass accretion rate coming from the outer parts in a multiplicative way , thus naturally producing the observed linear relation between the amplitude of the fluctuations and the time averaged flux ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and log - normal distribution of instantaneous values of fluxes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the model implies that there should be a definite time lag between variabilities of emission of outer and inner parts of the accretion flow .",
    "note than here we can compare only variabilities at long time scales , because short time scale fluctuations are absent at the outer parts of the disk .",
    "this prediction is not easy to check because of different complications .",
    "for example , in the case of galactic neutron star and black holes binaries it is relatively easy to observe the variability of the mass accretion rate in the innermost parts of the flow  in the x - ray energy band . at the same time , the mass accretion rate variations at the outer parts of the accretion disk are almost invisible to us because the internal energy release of accreting matter at these radii is negligible in comparison with the energy absorbed by the disk from the illuminating x - ray flux ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , the optical emission of these systems is largely determined by the reprocessing of their x - ray luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and thus does not provide us information about internal mass accretion rate variations at these radii . in accretion disks around supermassive black holes the characteristic time scales can be as large as years and tens of years , therefore requiring large monitoring campaigns , rarely avaiable ( see , however , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "one of the best available examples today of propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations ( flickering ) in the accreting systems can be found among dwarf novae  accreting non magnetized white dwarfs . in the work of @xcite",
    "it was shown that the x - ray emission of accreting white dwarf vw hyi in quiescence is delayed with respect to its uv emission with @xmath2100 sec .",
    "it is assumed that in this system the optically thick accretion disk , emitting uv radiation , ends at some distance from the white dwarf while the x - ray emission originates at the wd surface .",
    "the observed time lag was interpreted by authors as a time for the matter to travel from the inner parts of the optically thick accretion disk to the wd surface .",
    "due to rather uncertain issue about the disk truncation in case of dwarf novae in quiescence it is reasonable to look for better observational evidences of matter propagation in accretion flows . for this purpose",
    "we have selected luminous intermediate polars ( ips )  magnetized white dwarfs , in which the accretion disk is truncated very close to the wd surface ( although some ips maybe discless systems ) , but which , nevertheless , certainly have geometrically distinct regions generating the outgoing radiation . in intermediate polars",
    "x - rays originate close to the surface of wd , while the optical emission is mainly generated by the optically thick accretion disk or accretion curtains ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the optical emission of the disk can be powered either by its internal dissipation or , by a reprocessing of the x - ray emission , coming from the central object ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in cases of intermediate polars we have several advantges : 1 ) we know that the accretion disk is certainly truncated at some distance from wd because we see x - ray pulsations , 2 ) we can make an estimate of the innermost radius of this accretion disk judging from the shape of the power spectra of their time variability ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "high mass accretion rates in these systems ensure that the white dwarf magnetosphere is not large and thus the internal energy release in the accretion disk is not completely negligible in comparison with the illuminating x - ray flux from the wd .    we have performed a set of simultaneous observations of ex hya , v1223 sgr and tv col in x - ray and in optical spectral band with rxte / pca and the 1.9 m telescope of the south african astronomical observatory . in this paper we present results of this campaign .",
    "our sample includes three of the brightest intermediate polars of the southern hemisphere ( in order to ensure simultaneous observations with south african astronomical observatory ) : ex hya , v1223 sgr and tv col .",
    "these sources were observed by the rxte @xcite during approximately 20 ksec each in april 2010 . more detailed log of simultaneous rxte - saao observations is presented in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     data were analized with tasks of heasoft package , version v6.5 .",
    "rxte / pca background was estimated with the help of model , appropriate for faint sources `` cmfaint_l7 '' .",
    "lightcurves of sources were extracted from data of the first layer of pcu2 in energy band 3 - 15 kev , maximizing the signal to noise ratio .",
    "all lightcurves were background subtracted for the analysis .",
    "for aquiring optical lightcurves we used the recently commissioned high speed photo - polarimeter ( hippo ; @xcite ) on the 1.9 m telescope of the south african astronomical observatory during the nights beginning 15th , 17th and 18th april 2010 ( details of the observations is presented in table 1 ) .",
    "hippo is a 2 channel instrument capable of simultaneous two filtered photo - polarimetry .",
    "none of the targets showed statistically significant polarization in any filter and consequently the photometry is reported here only .",
    "data reduction proceeded as outlined in @xcite and binned to 1 second time resolution .",
    "absolute timing was maintained via the observatory s time service which is phased by a gps receiver .",
    "observations clearly show aperiodic variability of fluxes of all sources both in x - ray and in optical spectral bands . among the obtained datasets , observations of ex hya",
    "have the best quality ( the source is brighter than tv col in x - rays , and the length of overlaping observations is much larger than for v1223 sgr ) , therefore we will concentrate below on the case of ex hya , while presenting the similar results ( if statistics allows us ) for other sources .",
    "an example of lightcurves of ex hya , observed simutaneousely with rxte / pca and saao is shown in fig.[lcurve ] .",
    "close similarity between curves is clearly seen .",
    "the power spectra of variability of the source at these energies are very similar to each other ( see fig.[power_ex_hya ] ) .",
    "the shape of the power spectra can be adequately described by a simple analytical model ( following @xcite )    @xmath3^{-1/4}\\ ] ]    , describing smooth break between the slope of the power spectrum at low frequencies @xmath4 and at high frequencies @xmath5 .",
    "frequencies of the break in optical in x - ray data , collected in april 2010 , are @xmath6 hz and @xmath7 hz , correspondingly .",
    "if we fit the power spectrum of variability of x - ray flux of ex hya , averaged over all observations in rxte archive ( 1996 - 2010 , exposure time @xmath8200 ksec ) , we obtain the break frequency @xmath9 hz .",
    "assuming that the break frequency corresponds to the frequency of keplerian rotation at the boundary of the magnetosphere @xmath10 ( see evidences for this statement in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we can estimate the inner radius of the accretion disk in ex hya .",
    "we adopt the mass of the wd in ex hya @xmath11 @xcite , and thus its radius ( using @xcite ) @xmath12 cm .",
    "the estimate of the innermost radius of the disk from the value of the break frequency is @xmath13 cm , or @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , it is likely that the transition between the accretion disk and the wd magnetosphere is not a simple perfect circle and forms something like accretion curtains ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * )",
    ". therefore it would be reasonable to say that the position of the break in the power spectrum measures the position of these transition regions .",
    "it is remarkable to note note that estimates of distance of these accretion curtains from the wd surface made from completely different physical arguments , i.e. @xmath15 cm from analysis of emission line profiles @xcite and @xmath16 cm from analysis of spin modulated eclipses of the emission region @xcite very close to our estimates .",
    "this value of the radius of the transition region ( or size of the wd magnetopshere ) tells us that it is truncated much below the corotation radius .",
    "depending on details of coupling of the wd magnetosphere to the accretion disk it might lead to a certain spin up of the wd rotation .",
    "note , that the white dwarf in ex hya is indeed spinning up ( see the latest measurements in * ? ? ?",
    "similarity of optical and x - ray power spectra variability of ex hya is naturally predicted by the model of propagating fluctuations .",
    "variations of the mass accretion rate , flowing through the inner part of the accretion disk ( which creates optical / uv emission ) , results in a modulation in the mass accretion rate at the wd surface , thus generating variable x - ray flux .",
    "if the optical / uv light is powered mainly by the internal dissipation in the disk , then x - ray emission variations should lag the optical variation by a matter travel time in the magnetosphere    @xmath17    more accurately , if we will assume , that the matter is accelerating from zero velocity at @xmath18 towards the white dwarf and moves radially , then @xmath19    or    @xmath20\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    , which for our parameters is @xmath88 sec .",
    "however , if the reprocessing of the x - ray emission plays a dominant role in heating of the accretion disk ( note that surface of wd is heated by x - rays anyway ) , then the optical emission will lag the x - rays by a light crossing time @xmath21 msec .",
    "generation of this variability pattern is schematically shown in fig.[scheme ] .        in both cases",
    "the flux variability of the source in these spectral bands should be closely correlated .",
    "this is indeed observed .",
    "the curves are strongly correlated and the peak of the cross - corelation is at @xmath22 ( see fig.[cc ] ) .",
    "this directly shows that the variable optical emission of ex hya is mainly powered by reprocessing of x - rays ( the light crossing time lag @xmath86 msec can not be detected with time resolution of our datasets ) .",
    "however , it is seen on fig.[cc ] that the cross - corelation obviousely is not symmetric with respect to zero  there is much more correlation at negative delays ( optics leads x - rays ) , than on positive .",
    "this indicates that we do see some part of the internal dissipation in the disk and its variability leads the x - rays .    in order to demonstrate this point we have simulated the x - ray and optical lightcurves , and compared their cross - corelations with the observed one .",
    "we have simulated the x - ray lightcurve @xmath23 , which is suppossed to be representing mass accretion rate variations on wd surface , as a curve , whose power spectrum has a shape measured by us ( see above ) .",
    "then we have simulated the optical curve @xmath24 .",
    "this curve consists of two parts , one is having zero time lag with respect to x - ray curve ( simple reprocessing of the illuminating x - ray flux ) and another , which is preceeding the x - ray curve due to finite matter travel time from the place of generation of the optical emission to the wd surface .",
    "therefore , the curve @xmath24 was modelled as a sum of two copies of the simulated x - ray lightcurve with a range of time lags between them ( @xmath25 ) and fractional contribution of the delayed component given by @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "the cross - correlation of the resulted curves was compared with that obtained from observations in range of delays @xmath28 $ ] seconds . the @xmath29 contour plot with different values of the time lag and the fractional contribution of the delayed curve is shown on upper panel of fig .  [ ccfit ] .",
    "the minimum of the formally calculated @xmath29 is approximately @xmath30 for 39 degrees of freedom ( 41 data points and 2 parameters ) , but we should keep in mind that the neighboring values of the cross - corelation are not statistically independent because they use almost the same samples of observed points on lightcurves , therefore the face values of the @xmath29 can not be used to calculate true statistical significances . if we try to rescale the obtained minimum of the @xmath29 value to the number of d.o.f ( assuming , that the fit is good ) , the formal @xmath31 confidence intervals on the parameters would be : @xmath32 sec and @xmath33 .",

    "we only would like to mention some peculiarity in the power spectrum of variability of x - ray flux of tv col during our observations in 2010 .",
    "the power clearly has some excess ( quasiperiodic oscillation , qpo ) at frequencies around @xmath34 hz with an amplitude of @xmath35% . on the power spectrum obtained from all the data in the rxte archive",
    "this excess is not so narrow , indicating that it might be either a transient phenomenon , or a phenomenon with a floating centroid frequency .",

    "such behavior is very similar to that of power spectra of accreting magnetized neutron stars / x - ray pulars ( e.g. cen x-3 or 4u1626 - 67 , see @xcite ) .",

    "this indicates that the inner accretion disk radius has decreased since the 2008 observations . adopting this new inner radius of the accretion disk @xmath38 cm ( here we adopted @xmath39 )",
    "we can estimate that the lag due to matter travel time in the magnetosphere of v1223 sgr should be small , @xmath40 sec and thus , undetectable with time resolution of our optical data ( 1 sec ) .",

    "the best avaiable dataset of ex hya allowed us to obtain the results summarized below .",
    "datasets of sources v1223 sgr and tv col are poorer quality , but they demonstrate the same properties ( as far as the statistics allow ) of power spectra of their variability and cross - corelation functions .    * the power spectra of the flux variability of ex hya in optical and x - ray spectral bands are very similar to each other and have a break in the slope @xmath4 to @xmath5 at the frequency @xmath41 hz . following @xcite we relate this break with the transition of the matter from the disk flow at larger distances from the wd to the magnetospheric flow closer to the wd .",
    "the break in the power spectrum is at much higher frequencies than the wd spin frequency , thus indicating that the disk ends within the corotation radius .",
    "* x - ray and optical lightcurves are strongly correlated with peak of cross - corelation function around zero timelag .",
    "we interpret this as a sign of reprocessing of x - ray light at surfaces of the optically thick accretion disk , the accretion curtains and the wd .",
    "* however , we detect a clear and stable asymmetry of the x - ray - optical crosscorrelation function , which indicates that at least some part of the optical variability leads the x - ray variability .",
    "we measure the the time lag between these variabilities @xmath42 sec , which is consistent with the travel time of matter from the inner radius of the accretion disk ( or accretion curtains ) , along the magnetosphere , to the white dwarf surface .",
    "we interpret this as a clear sign of the propagating fluctuation in the accretion flow . in this particular case",
    "we estimate that approximately @xmath43% of the optical variability is preceeding the variability of the x - ray lightcurve , indicating a significant contribution of the internal energy dissipation in the disk to the total energy budget of the inner part of the optically thick accretion disk .",
