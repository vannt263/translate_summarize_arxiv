    "liposomal vesicle consists of a lipid bilayer separating the interior volume , containing an aqueous solution , from an exterior suspension .",
    "the vesicle membrane allows for a free exchange of water between the interior and the exterior of the liposome , with the flux determined by the membrane composition . on the other hand ,",
    "lipidic membrane strongly inhibits passage of large molecules , in particular , if they contain ionized groups .",
    "liposomes are of great theoretical interest as the simplest model of a biological cell .",
    "they are also of great practical importance as vehicles for drug delivery . in the latter case liposomes",
    "are designed to contain a specific drug or a gene needed to fight the decease .",
    "the liposomal affinity for infected tissue can be increased by varying the membrane composition or including ligands which bind to specific receptors .",
    "if a vesicle containing high internal solute concentration is placed inside a dilute solution , the osmotic influx of solvent into the interior of a vesicle can lead to its rupture . whether , the rupture occurs depends on the membrane elasticity and on the internal solute concentration of the liposome .",
    "rupture of the liposomal membrane results in formation of pores  @xcite .",
    "this releases the membrane stress , but comes at a price of exposing the hydrophobic membrane interior ( lipidic tails ) to water .",
    "once a pore is formed , the internal content of the vesicle begins to leak out , resulting in a decrease of membrane tension and eventual pore closure .",
    "we find that depending on the vesicle size and internal concentration of solute , pores can be either short or long lived . for long lived pores a scaling relation between the life - time of a pore and the size of the vesicle is found .",
    "the full phase diagram of pore stability in the concentration - vesicle size plane is constructed , and the different scaling regimes are deduced analytically .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we review , the previously derived equations governing the nucleation and growth of a pore in an osmotically stressed vesicle  @xcite . in section [ dynamics ] numerical solution of dynamical equations is presented . in section [ phase ] the phase diagram for different dynamical regimes is derived . in section [ solute ]",
    "the rate of solute leak - out is determined and analytical estimates of the pore life - time are provided . finally , in section [ conclusions ] the conclusions are presented .",
    "as was already stressed in the introduction , the liposomal membrane allows for a free exchange of water between the exterior and the interior of a vesicle .",
    "the rate of this exchange is determined by the permeability of membrane , @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "lipidic membrane strongly inhibits exchange of solute molecules between the inside and the outside of a liposome .",
    "when a vesicle of high internal solute concentration is placed inside a solute - depleted medium , an osmotic pressure difference causes an influx of water into the vesicle .",
    "a vesicle then swells until the internal laplace pressure is able to compensate the the osmotic pressure .",
    "the influx of water result in a build up of membrane stress which energetically favors membrane rupture and formation of pores .",
    "pores are nucleated in the membrane through thermal fluctuations . here",
    "we consider the opening of a single pore .",
    "the underlying assumption is that , once a pore is formed , stress is quickly released and the creation of a second pore becomes highly unlikely .",
    "this situation is quite different from what is encountered in electroporation . in that case",
    "opening of a pore does not fully release the membrane stress , which is induced by the transmembrane potential , and one finds a coexistence of pores with different sizes@xcite .",
    "the single pore assumption allow us to write simple equations governing the internal vesicle dynamics . designating the difference between the internal and the external molar concentrations of solute as @xmath1  and considering , for mathematical simplicity , a spherical vesicle of radius @xmath2 , and a circular pore of radius @xmath3",
    " the mass conservation leads to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the density of water , @xmath6 the osmotic current and @xmath7 is the leak - out velocity .    the osmotic current @xmath6 is determined by the permeability of the liposomal membrane and the difference between the target osmotic pressure @xmath8 and the laplace pressure , @xmath9 inside and outside the vesicle . in the above expressions @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath11 is temperature , @xmath12 is the avogadro number , and @xmath13 is the membrane surface tension .",

    "if @xmath1 is not too large , the membrane integrity will not be compromised , and a stationary state with @xmath16 will be achieved . under these conditions the osmotic pressure",
    "is completely compensated by the laplace pressure , resulting in a zero net flux of solvent . for sufficiently _ large _ internal concentration of solute , a stationary state will _ not _ be achieved before membrane ruptures .",
    "the leak - out velocity  @xcite of the internal content of a liposome is determined by the balance between the shear stress , proportional to @xmath17 , and the laplace pressure inside the vesicle @xmath18 . for low reynolds numbers  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the solvent viscosity .",
    "the growth of a pore is controlled by the rate at which the membrane elastic energy is dissipated . since the viscosity of membrane is five orders of magnitude larger than that of water , most of the energy dissipation is confined to the membrane interior  @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the membrane width and @xmath23 is the membrane viscosity .",
    "a lipid bilayer has low permeability to solute particles , in particular if they are charged , so that the internal solute concentration is modified only through the osmotic influx of solvent or the efflux of solute through an open pore , after the membrane has ruptured .",
