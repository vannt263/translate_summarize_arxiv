    "until recently , there has been no extensive survey of the extragalactic sky in neutral hydrogen ( ) . the mass distribution in the universe has therefore been traced by galaxy surveys in other wavebands , particularly in the optical , but also in the infrared using the iras satellite . because of the limited nature of existing surveys , it is unclear whether there is a significant local population of -rich objects not seen in optical and infrared surveys ( away from the galactic plane ) . in particular , the existence of  clouds without optical counterparts , or ",
    "protogalaxies might significantly add to the local  mass density of the universe .",
    "recent observations by @xcite and @xcite arrive at somewhat differing conclusions regarding the low -mass galaxy population , leading to some uncertainty in the contribution of these objects to the hi mass in the local universe .",
    "limits to the presence of a population of -rich clouds and ` protogalaxies ' have been set by a number of ` blind ' or semi-`blind '  surveys conducted in a range of environments : clusters @xcite , groups @xcite , voids @xcite , and in the general field @xcite . in addition , there have been numerous observations in off - source calibration regions for galaxies which have been optically - selected . for example , @xcite serendipitously detected a couple of dozen galaxies in the calibration scans from their survey , all with optical counterparts .",
    "a number of  clouds without optical counterparts have been found .",
    "however , many appear to be closely associated with massive galaxies @xcite and perhaps the product of tidal interactions @xcite .",
    "a number of potential  protogalaxies have later been classified as high velocity clouds @xcite , and argument continues over the extragalactic nature of a specific class of compact high velocity clouds @xcite .",
    "one of the larger blind surveys to date @xcite detected 75 galaxies in 55 deg@xmath7 of sky .",
    "one detection was found not to have any obvious optical counterpart , though a bright star just near the peak of the emission may obscure a low surface brightness optical companion .",
    "the closest and best examples of  clouds without prominent counterparts are the virgo cloud hi 1225 + 01 @xcite , and the leo ring @xcite .",
    "both of these  clouds were later found to be associated with optical galaxies .",
    "hi 1225 + 01 was found serendipitously during routine calibration observations .",
    "it comprises two regions of  emission : the largest has a magellanic - type dwarf irregular galaxy at the position of the highest  column density , while the smaller , possibly infalling cloud shows no optical emission to a faint limiting magnitude @xcite .",
    "the larger component has a total dynamical mass of @xmath8 , and a gas mass of @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distance in units of @xmath11 .",
    "the heliocentric velocity of the cloud is 1275 and the extent of the  emission is about @xmath12 .",
    "the leo ring is an intergalactic cloud found during  observations of the leo group of galaxies .",
    "it comprises a large ring of  emission surrounding ngc 3384 and m105 , with an  mass of @xmath13 .",
    "the velocity structure suggests that it is probably not a tidal tail from the nearby galaxies , but a primordial gas cloud which has not started forming stars @xcite .",
    "the cloud is gravitationally bound to the optical galaxies in the group .",
    "both of these objects have been used in h@xmath14 studies to determine limits on the local ionising background @xcite , finding limits which suggest that quasar light , not galactic light , dominates the local ionizing background at low redshift .",
    "the  parkes all sky survey ( ) has been underway since 1997 and , when complete , will be the largest blind  survey to date , surveying a volume at least two orders of magnitude larger than any previous survey .",
    "in early   observations of 600 deg@xmath7 in the centaurus region , @xcite found 10 new members of the nearby centaurus a group .",
    "all of these have optical companions , although 5 are faint and were previously uncatalogued .",
    "other early observations include the south celestial cap @xcite . during routine inspection of this data , a resolved  detection ,  j1712 - 64 ,",
    "was selected for follow - up observations as it showed no catalogued galaxy in the vicinity and no optical counterpart on the digitised sky survey .",
    "it also had a low systemic velocity ( though well - separated from galactic gas and high velocity clouds ) and a significant angular size .",

    "subsequently , two deep original plates were obtained from the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) plate archive and subjected to a photographic enhancement technique @xcite which is capable of revealing extended features over 5 mag fainter than the night sky @xcite .",
    "at the site of the ukst ( siding spring ) this is typically @xmath32 mag arcsec@xmath3 .",
    "only two suitable plates were available , and an image was made by combining photographically enhanced derivatives from both of them : j1659 ( iiia - j / gg 395 , 395530 nm ) and or15092 ( iiia - f / rg 590 , 590 - 690 nm ) . both were plates of excellent quality but in both cases the object centre was close to the vignetting region towards the edge of the ukst focal plane .",
    "the iiia - j passband is the most sensitive to extended stellar light ( assuming a solar spectrum ) and would reveal extended features at least as faint as 27.5 mag arcsec@xmath3 .",
    "the derivative from the red - sensitive plate achieves a detection limit of about @xmath19 26.8 mag arcsec@xmath3 because of the brighter night sky in the red .",
    "nothing unusual is seen on deep derivatives from either plate , or on the combined image .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that large , featureless low surface brightness objects are particularly difficult to detect in crowded fields . for an optical companion of 1  in diameter and lying just beneath our optical limit , these limits suggest an absolute magnitude @xmath33 mag , and an  mass - to - light ratio @xmath34 ( table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the source was also imaged in the optical @xmath35-band at the anu 40-inch telescope at siding springs observatory on 1999 april 15 .",
    "it was also imaged in the b and r - bands by the ctio 40-inch telescope on 1999 may 4 .",
    "the data were reduced using the package and calibration for the @xmath36 and @xmath37-band images used photometric observations of the landolt standard field 104 @xcite .",

    "hipass j1712 - 64 is well - resolved in each of the velocity channels with significant emission ( see fig . [",
    "f : chan ] ) .",

    "the systemic velocity is @xmath46 and the velocity width is @xmath47 ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "any gradient across this component is again only a few  ( fig .",
    "[ f : mom1 ] ) .",
    "a bridge of emission appears to join the ne and sw components in a manner reminiscent of the virgo cloud hi 1225 + 01 @xcite .",
    "velocities appear to increase smoothly from the ne to the sw components .",
    "the overall  structure appears to be that of two separate , but interacting components .",
    "the source is located close to the galactic plane at @xmath48 ) , and therefore extinction may be important .",
    "we have estimated this using three methods .",
    "the local  column density from the  data ( reprocessed to avoid any spatial filtering ) is @xmath49 , which corresponds to @xmath50 . following the conversion formula of @xcite",
    ", this implies @xmath51 mag .",
    "the extinction determined from the cobe / dirbe and iras / issa maps based on dust temperature is essentially identical : @xmath52 mag @xcite . finally , the @xcite extinction maps suggest a similar value @xmath53 mag . taking the mean value , @xmath54 ,",
    "this implies a blue - light absorption of @xmath55 mag .",
    "thus although the stellar density in the optical images is quite high ( see fig .  [",
    "f : olay ] ) , there is no evidence for large optical extinction in the direction of the  detection .",
    "an optical counterpart could be overlooked if the j1712 - 64 is very close to the milky way and resolved into stars .",
    "one method of detecting a resolved galaxy in a crowded field of stars is to search a colour - colour plot of the stars in a field , to look for a separate stellar population .",
    "this method was used to detect the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "we applied this method to the @xmath36 and @xmath37-band ccd images .",
    "these images cover an area of about 1 deg@xmath7 , which is substantially larger than the detection .",
    "fig  [ f : hist ] shows a histogram of stellar magnitudes for a 20  field centred on the  detection , and other nearby fields of the same size .",
    "these fields are statistically equivalent , thus there is no evidence for a resolved galaxy in the direction of the  detection .",
    "the systemic velocity of the  detection is @xmath56  ( ne component ) .",
    "the velocity with respect to the local group can be determined using @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath58  which , if we assume  j1712 - 64 to be extragalactic and @xmath59 km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 , corresponds to a distance of 3.2 mpc ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "this would place  j1712 - 64 at some distance beyond the local group .",
    "this distance is subject to considerable uncertainty .",
    "alternate local group velocities range from @xmath60 ( using @xmath61 ) to @xmath62  ( potent , @xcite ) , giving distances of 3.9 mpc and 2.3 mpc , respectively . without the aid of optical distance measures , subsequent calculations involving the distance to j1712 - 64",
    "will therefore be based on the value of @xmath63 mpc . at this distance ,",
    "the projected separation of the nw and sw components is @xmath64 , the overall  size is @xmath65 and the  mass is @xmath66 . for a substantially smaller distance ,",
    "say 100 kpc ( see   [ sec : alt ] ) , the separation , size and mass are @xmath67 pc , @xmath68 pc and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the velocities within j1712 - 64 are very low .",
    "the velocity separation of the ne and sw components is only 12 , and the velocity dispersions within each component are small . for the ne component ,",
    "the mean velocity dispersion from the atca data is @xmath70   ( see table  [ table1 ] ) , possibly slightly more for the sw component , although the s / n ratio is too low for a reliable estimate .",
    "if the velocity difference between the ne and sw components is indicative of the rotation of a bound , binary system at 3.2 mpc , the minimum system mass is @xmath71 @xcite , an order of magnitude above the  mass .",
    "the ` virial ' distance , at which the total mass is 1.3 times the  mass ( to account for he ) , is implausibly distant ( @xmath72 mpc ) implying that the system contains substantial dark matter ( @xmath73 , which would be a reasonable value for disk galaxies ) , or else is not bound .",
    "the orbital period of the two components corresponding to the minimum total mass is @xmath74 gyr .",
    "the ne component alone can be modelled as a pressure - supported sphere of gas of total enclosed mass    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 is the radius ( @xmath79 kpc ) and @xmath80 depending on the mass distribution . for an isothermal sphere , @xmath81 , which gives @xmath82 , which is only @xmath83 times higher than the  mass for this component .",
    "again , for a distance of 100 kpc , the mass drops to @xmath84 , but this is now @xmath85 times greater than the  mass if in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the critical column density above which local axisymmetric instabilities can occur in a uniformly rotating gaseous disk is given by the toomre stability criterion :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the sound speed and @xmath88 is angular frequency @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that similar relations for differentially rotating stellar disks approximately predict the column density above which star formation occurs in spiral galaxies .",
    "if we use @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 kpc for the ne component of j1712 - 64 ( assuming it to be extragalactic ) , then we obtain @xmath92 .",
    "this is a factor of two above the peak measured column density of just @xmath93 ( fig",
    "[ f : mom ] ) , consistent with the absence of visible star - formation .",
    "nearby , faint galaxies which are resolved into stars can be especially hard to spot even far from the crowding in the galactic plane ( e.g. sextans  @xcite ) . in   [ sec : op ] we have shown that there is no evidence in color - magnitude diagrams for this .",
    "in addition , the local group velocity , @xmath94  is well beyond the @xmath95  which appears to encompass most known local group members @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f : lg ] , where j1712 - 64 has the highest heliocentric and local group velocity of all the probable and possible local group members plotted .",
    "it has also has a higher velocity than the class of ` local group outliers ' which have distances of @xmath96 mpc and are regarded by @xcite as only potential members .",
    "in addition , the irregular galaxy ic 4662 lies 37 on the sky from  j1712 - 64 , has a velocity of @xmath97 , almost 150  lower , yet is not classified as belonging to the local group @xcite . therefore",
    ", from its velocity , there is no evidence for j1712 - 64 being a galaxy lying within the local group .",
    "the most likely alternative explanation for the classification of  j1712 - 64 is that it is an unusual high - velocity cloud ( hvc ) lying at the edge of our own galaxy .",
    "hvcs are  objects which do not fit into a simple model of galactic rotation and do not have optical counterparts @xcite .",
    "they are widespread across the sky , with a covering factor estimated to be 0.2  0.4 for @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "there are two good reason to exclude the possibility of j1712 - 64 being a normal hvc .",
    "the first is its velocity , which is 40  higher than any currently catalogued hvc ( e.g. those around the large magellanic cloud  @xcite ) .",
    "the second is j1712 - 64 s hi structure .",
    "most hvcs have a core - halo morphology with only 1050% of the total flux able to be recovered by interferometry @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : spec ] , however , the atca observations were able to recover 80% of the total flux .",
    "it may , however , be an extreme version of the compact hvcs studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "these objects exhibit narrow linewidths and also show apparent velocity gradients .",
    "j1712 - 64 lies in a 2400 deg@xmath99 region around the south celestial cap @xcite where many of the hvcs appear to have originated from the interaction of the magellanic clouds with the milky way .",
    "it is possible that a compact hvc similar to j1712 - 64 could have originated from gravitational scattering off the three - body magellanic clouds / galaxy system .",
    "however ,  j1712 - 64 does not lie close to the clouds ( it is 46  from the lmc ) , and the leading arm , which includes hvcs 334 and 352 of @xcite ( see figure  3 of @xcite ) , is @xmath100 away . a velocity separation of @xmath101 and a spatial separation from the lmc of @xmath85 kpc ( or @xmath102 kpc from the galaxy ) would be consistent with an ejection event coinciding with the last lmc / smc encounter which probably occurred @xmath103 yr ago @xcite .",
    "an examination of the spatial and velocity distribution of future objects , similar to  j1712 - 64 , will ultimately demonstrate their relationship , if any , with the magellanic system .",
    "although there have been many previous searches for extragalactic   in optically blank fields @xcite , there has been little success , implying that massive  ` protogalaxies ' are rare at the present epoch .",
    "however ,  j1712 - 64 has a very low  mass , @xmath104  , implying that similar objects may exist in abundance and may have escaped previous detection through lack of sensitivity .",
    "some limits exist from the cen  a  results of @xcite , who find 10 new group members , all with corresponding optical counterparts , in the 600 deg@xmath7 they surveyed around the cen  a group . however , their sensitivity limit is @xmath105   so it is possible that slightly deeper observations @xcite may reveal more such objects .",
    "the  observations of the south celestial cap , decl .",
    "@xmath106 @xcite , comprise 2400 deg@xmath7 of sky , but contains only a few other candidate ` protogalaxies ' , which are awaiting follow - up ccd data .",
    "however ,  j1712 - 64 is the most significant detection in terms of flux density and angular size",
    ". nevertheless , for there to exist large numbers of similar objects would require them to have  masses @xmath107  .",
    "interestingly , a system with a similar velocity and  morphology , zoa j1616 - 55 , was found in a search for galaxies in the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) near @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "this system has a similar distance and  column density to   j1712 - 64 but a higher  mass ( @xmath109  ) and diameter ( 86 kpc ) .",
    "although lying in the zoa , the estimated blue absorption is only @xmath110 mag , so the lack of an optical or ir counterpart led @xcite to conclude it was a galaxy pair of low optical surface brightness .",
    "j1712 - 64 is only 11  ( projected separation 600 kpc ) from j1616 - 55 and 19  ( projected separation 1.1 mpc ) from the massive circinus galaxy .",
    "possibly , all three are part of a loose southern extension to the cen  a group . in the hvc hypothesis ,",
    "the alternative is that circinus is unrelated and both j1712 - 64 and j1616 - 55 have a magellanic origin .    from a study of the ly@xmath14 forest lines and a vla  study ,",
    "@xcite suggest that , at @xmath111 , there may exist clouds , or sheets , of ionized gas @xmath112 mpc in extent which contain @xmath113 times more baryons than the neutral gas confined to known galaxies .",
    "objects such as j1712 - 64 may be the most easily visible manifestations of these large primordial clouds .",
    "so , although the neutral gas content in j1712 - 64 is hardly enough to make a star cluster , let alone a galaxy , there may be significantly more baryons in the region available to form a galaxy if they were able to cool .",
    "the possibility that the dynamical mass of the j1712 - 64 system is @xmath114 times greater than the  mass suggests there may be dark matter of some sort associated with the system .",
    "isolated  clouds can be used to set stringent limits on the local metagalactic background radiation .",
    "deep narrow - band ccd images of the h@xmath14 line in hi 1225 + 01 and the leo ring place limits of @xmath115 for quasar - like light @xcite .",
    "h@xmath14 observations of j1712 - 64 may also help provide strong constraints on this background .",
    "such observations would also be useful in providing a lower limit to the distance to j1712 - 64 in light of the observation that many nearby hvcs have faint but detectable h@xmath14 emission probably resulting from the galactic ionization field @xcite .",
    "the mean velocity dispersion of the ne component of j1712 - 64 appears to be low , @xmath116  ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this gives an upper limit to the kinetic temperature of @xmath4 k. the existence of cool gas would be interesting as this requires that there are densities high enough to allow cooling and may therefore indicate that star - formation is about to commence . in order to search for cool gas , we examined the atca  spectrum of pks 1708 - 648 which is 194 from the center of the j1712 - 64 .",
    "however , we were unable to detect any unambiguous evidence for absorption .",
    "this is probably not significant as the continuum source is well beyond the last measured contour of  j1712 - 64 .",
    "an isolated  cloud ,  j1712 - 64 , has been found during the course of the  survey .",
    "it appears to be a nearby extragalactic cloud lying beyond the outer fringes of the local group at a distance of @xmath1 mpc , though an alternative explanation is that of an hvc with unique properties .",
    "optical limits imply a surface brightness , corrected for obscuration of @xmath117 mag arcsec@xmath3 and an  mass - to - light ratio @xmath118 for a putative optical counterpart of diameter 1 .",
    "the system appears to have two components , separated by 9 kpc , with a bridge of gas between them .",
    "the mean velocity dispersion of the ne component is low , @xmath79  implying that j1712 - 64 contains cool gas ( @xmath4 k ) .",
    "however , it appears to be dynamically stable against star - formation .",
    "although the  mass is low , @xmath119  ( for a distance of 3.2 mpc ) , the velocity differences within the system suggest that there may be an extended dark matter halo if the system is bound .",
    "is  j1712 - 64 important from a cosmological point of view ?",
    "this depends on whether similar objects exist in great numbers , whether they represent the cool , high - density baryonic peaks of low - amplitude overdensities , whether such objects are the building blocks of galaxy and star cluster formation , whether they are simply the left - overs of these processes , and whether they are indeed extragalactic .",
    "future  observations will cast some light on the frequency of their occurrence , and their distribution on the sky .",

    "<S> we report the discovery , from the  parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) , of an isolated cloud of neutral hydrogen which we believe to be extragalactic . </S>",
    "<S> the  mass of the cloud ( hipass j1712 - 64 ) is very low , @xmath0 , using an estimated distance of @xmath1 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> most significantly , we have found no optical companion to this object to very faint limits ( @xmath2 mag arcsec@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hipass j1712 - 64 appears to be a binary system similar to , but much less massive than , hi 1225 + 01 ( the virgo   cloud ) and has a size of at least 15 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the mean velocity dispersion , measured with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , is only 4  for the main component and because of the weak or non - existent star - formation , possibly reflects the thermal linewidth ( @xmath4 k ) rather than bulk motion or turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the peak column density for hipass j1712 - 64 , from the combined parkes and atca data , is only @xmath5 , which is estimated to be a factor of two below the critical threshold for star formation . </S>",
    "<S> apart from its significantly higher velocity , the properties of hipass j1712 - 64 are similar to the recently recognised class of compact high velocity clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore consider the evidence for a local group or galactic origin , although a more plausible alternative is that hipass j1712 - 64 was ejected from the interacting magellanic cloud / galaxy system at perigalacticon @xmath6 yr ago . </S>"
