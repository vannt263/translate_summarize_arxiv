    "@xmath2 near a point of the manifold a system can be written in the standard form @xmath3    an implicit system is with _ locally bounded derivatives _ if the restriction of the bundle projection to the system surface is a proper map .",
    "this restriction is called the _ system folding_. only systems with locally bounded derivatives are considered below .",
    "we identify the space of systems with locally bounded derivatives with the space of respective maps @xmath4 then a _ generic _ system is a system from some open everywhere dense subset in this space , for the fine topology of whitney .",
    "a _ solution curve _ of an implicit system is defined as a differentiable map @xmath5 from an interval of the real line to the base manifold such that the image of its natural lifting @xmath6 to the tangent bundle belongs to the system surface .",
    "a _ phase curve _ is the image of such a map @xmath7 and a _ trajectory _ is the image of its lifting .    in this paper",
    "we study the _ point singularities _ of the family of phase curves provided by a germ of a system surface and present the complete list of generic singularities on the plane up to smooth orbital equivalence .    for a generic system",
    "its surface is a closed smooth @xmath0-dimensional submanifold in the tangent bundle space , owing to thom transversality theorem .",
    "then the system folding is a smooth map between @xmath0-dimensional manifolds .",
    "therefore the folding of a generic system can have all generic singularities like a map between @xmath0-dimensional manifolds .",
    "in fact the kernel of the bundle projection is also @xmath0-dimensional and , due to goryunov s theorem@xcite , such dimension of the kernel permits all generic singularities for maps between @xmath0-dimensional manifolds .",
    "a generic system near a regular point of its folding can be resolved with respect to derivatives . in this case , near such a point , the singularity theory of family of solutions of an implicit system is reduced to the well known theory of family of the phase curves for the generic smooth vector fields on @xmath0-dimensional manifolds @xcite .    for a generic system",
    "the velocity does not vanish at any singular point of the system folding .",
    "consequently , near such a point , there is well - defined the _ system 1-folding _ which is the restriction of the projectivization of the tangent bundle to the system surface .",
    "again goryunov s theorem implies that the 1-folding of a generic system can have all singularities like a generic map from an @xmath0-dimensional manifold to an @xmath8-dimensional one .    in particular",
    ", for the @xmath9-dimensional case the 1-folding of a generic system can have regular points and singular points providing whitney umbrella singularities .",
    "that implies , for a generic implicit system , the classification of point singularities of families of phase curves ( see theorem [ gen1 ] , [ gen2 ] ) . besides well known singularities of a generic vector fields on the plane and ones described by generic first order implicit differential equations there is only one singularity provided by the implicit differential equation on the whitney umbrella generically embedded to the space of directions on the plane ( figures [ vectorfield ] , [ foldedsing ] , and [ generic - fig ] ) .",
    "up to smooth orbital equivalence the respective family of phase curve is the family of solutions of the implicit system @xmath10 near the origin .",
    "the family of solutions of the implicit equation @xmath11 has been well - known in another situation : v.i.arnold found it by the investigation of slow motion of generic relaxation type equations with one fast and two slow variables @xcite@xcite .",
    "however the last case and the case studied in this paper are different . at the first place ,",
    "the equation surface in the space of directions on the plane is smooth in the theory of the relaxation type equation , while it has the whitney umbrella singularity for the implicit system case . at the second place ,",
    "the plane distribution on the space of directions on the plane has singularities and is not the contact structure in the theory of the relaxation type equation , while it is the contact structure in the implicit system case .",
    "however if we put into correspondence to a relaxation type equation @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 are smooth functions and @xmath14 is a small parameter ) the surface @xmath15 , then the restriction of the projection @xmath16 to this surface is an analogue of 1-folding . in a generic case this restriction is well - defined near any critical point of the folding being here the restriction of the projection @xmath17 to the surface @xmath18 .",
    "that reduces arnold s case to the considered one .",
    "we also present the complete classification of generic singularities for clairaut implicit systems on the plane ( figure [ clairaut - fig ] ) .",
    "an implicit system is called _ of clairaut type _",
    "if the system surface is smooth and , for any critical point of its folding , the velocity corresponding to this point is non - zero and lies in the image of the tangent plane to the system surface under the derivative of the folding , like the classical clairaut equations . under a mild condition ,",
    "any implicit system of clairaut type can be approximated by a system of clairaut type which is foliated by smooth trajectories projecting to non - sigular solution curves .",
    "actually we give the generic classification of such systems .",
    "see section [ classification in the clairaut case . ] for details .              remark that several singularities of the systems are studied in the _ parametric forms _ , not in the implicit forms .",
    "the parametric method provides , as well as the simple process of getting normal forms , also the clear understanding of moduli spaces of the singularities and the easy drawing of pictures of the phase portaits .    in section [ classification ] , we present the normal forms both in generic case and generic clairaut case .",

    "then the classification under the smooth orbital equivalence of surfaces in @xmath37 is reduced , via its @xmath36-folding and up to orientation of orbits , to the classification under the contact diffeomorphisms on @xmath33 preserving the canonical fibration @xmath39 .",

    "the converse is not true in general : for example , the system @xmath52 is not of clairaut type in the sense of dara , but it satisfes the condition @xmath43 .",
