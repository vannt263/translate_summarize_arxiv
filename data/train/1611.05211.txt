    "after the discovery of a higgs boson in 2012 @xcite , the fundamental mechanism for stabilizing the electroweak scale has become an urgent topic . weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most promising candidates for addressing such an outstanding theoretical issue .",
    "susy predicts a plethora of supersymmetric particles , among which the top - squarks ( stops ) play an important role in cancelling the quadratic divergence in the higgs boson mass .",
    "naturalness ( absence of fine - tuning in the higgs boson mass ) requires stop masses to be below 1 tev in the mssm @xcite .",
    "therefore , the search for light stops is a sensitive probe of the naturalness in susy @xcite .",
    "so far , atlas and cms collaborations have performed extensive searches for stops at the lhc run-1 and run-2 .",
    "based on a recent run-2 ( @xmath8 fb@xmath9 ) dataset , the stop mass has been excluded up to @xmath10 1 tev in simplified models @xcite .",
    "the current search strategies are specialized for different kinematical regions .",
    "for example , when @xmath11 , the top quarks from stop decays are usually energetic and can be discriminated from the @xmath12 background by using endpoint observables , such as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "but in the compressed region like @xmath14 , the decay products of the stop are usually too soft to tag and hence the monojet signature is used @xcite .        like the top quark",
    ", stops can be produced in pair , but also can be singly produced via the electroweak interaction , such as the associated production with a chargino , @xmath15 @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] .",
    "such a single stop production can have a sizable cross section at the lhc when the stop and chargino are not heavy or the chargino is much lighter than the stop @xcite . although it may not be a good discovery channel as the stop pair production ,",
    "its study is meaningful because it can be used as a complementary channel to probe the electroweak properties of the stop @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the feasibility of probing the single stop production process @xmath16 in a compressed susy scenario , where the chargino @xmath17 is almost degenerate with the lightest neutralino @xmath1 .",
    "such a spectrum is motivated by natural susy @xcite or the well - tempered neutralino frameworks @xcite . due to the small mass splitting between @xmath18 and @xmath1",
    ", such a single stop production will give the mono - top signature @xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite its full - hadronic final states with top tagging technique are studied . in this study , we focus on the leptonic decay channel of the top quark , which will have a moderate background ( no qcd backgrounds ) and the cut on the leptonic @xmath19 can greatly reduce the @xmath12 and @xmath20 backgrounds @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the open angle of the charged lepton and @xmath21-jet in the top decay in lab - frame and find such an observable can effectively reduce the sm backgrounds of the single stop production .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the single stop production and stop decays in the compressed electroweakino scenario . in sec .",
    "iii , we perform detailed monte carlo simulations for the leptonic mono - top signature from the single stop production .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in sec .  iv .",
    "* @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in this limit ,",
    "the two neutralinos @xmath49 and the chargino @xmath18 are nearly degenerate higgsinos ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "such a higgsino lsp scenario may be probed at the high luminosity lhc @xcite .",
    "* @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . in this case ,",
    "the lightest neutralino @xmath57 and the lighter chargino @xmath18 are nearly degenerate winos ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "if the small splitting between @xmath18 and @xmath57 is not too small , the mono - jet with soft photon events can be used to detect this wino lsp scenario at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the mass spectrum and branching ratios of all sparticles with @xcite .",
    "we use @xcite to calculate the leading order cross section of the single stop production . the nnpdf23lo1 @xcite parton distribution functions are chosen for our calculations .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are taken to be the default value .",
    "we include the nlo - qcd effect by applying a @xmath59-factor of 1.3 @xcite to the single stop production .",
    "it should be noted that the single stop production not only relies on the nature of the electroweakinos , but also is affected by the polarized states of the stop . to demonstrate this , we consider two cases : the left - handed stop @xmath22 by taking @xmath60 tev to decouple the right - handed component , and the right - handed stop @xmath23 by taking @xmath61 tev to decouple the left - handed component .     and 50 .",

    ", width=576 ]    in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] , we show the cross sections of the associated production of stop and chargino at the 14 tev lhc for four different final states : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the contributions of the conjugate processes are included . for a higgsino - like chargino",
    ", we can see that the associated production of @xmath67 has the largest cross section , which can reach about 3 pb at @xmath68 gev . while the cross section of @xmath69 strongly depends on the value of @xmath38 , since the coupling of the left - handed stop with @xmath70",
    "is dominated by the bottom yukawa coupling @xmath39 and can be enhanced by a large @xmath38 . for a wino - like",
    "chargino , the cross section of @xmath71 is always much larger than that of @xmath72 because of the gauge interactions .",
    "we also plot the branching ratios of stop decaying to the top quark and neutralinos in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : cos ] . for higgsino case , it can be seen that a left - handed stop @xmath22 dominantly decays to @xmath73 at @xmath74 .",
    "the reason is that the decay width of @xmath75 is proportional to @xmath39 and is suppressed for a small @xmath38 .",
    "if the stop is right - handed @xmath23 , its couplings with @xmath49 and @xmath70 are proportional to @xmath76 , and the branching ratios of @xmath77 and @xmath78 are about 50% and 50% , respectively . for the wino case , both @xmath22 and @xmath23 decay to @xmath79 with the same branching ratio . in the following ,",
    "we take the higgsino - like chargino and right - handed stop as an example to investigate the observability of the single stop production at the lhc .",
    "since @xmath18 and @xmath49 are the nearly degenerate higgsinos in our considered scenario , the mass splitting between them is small so that @xmath18 and @xmath80 appear as missing transverse energy at the lhc .",
    "this leads to the mono - top signature for the single stop production at the lhc , which is @xmath81 in our simulation , we focus on the leptonic mono - top channel . contrary to the hadronic mode , the problematic qcd multijet background can be safely neglected in this case .",
    "we use @xcite to generate the parton level events .",
    "then , we perform the parton shower and hadronization by @xcite . the jets are clustered by the anti-@xmath82 algorithm with a cone radius @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "we implement the detector effects with @xcite .",
    "the sm backgrounds are dominated by the following three processes :    * the largest sm backgrounds are the semi- and di - leptonic @xmath12 productions , where the missing lepton and the limited jet energy resolution will lead to relatively large missing @xmath84 .",
    "the leading order cross section of @xmath12 production is normalized to its approximate next - to - next - to - leading - order value @xmath85 pb @xcite . *",
    "the subdominant background is the single top production , which is irreducible , up to a jet that could come from isr .",
    "we include three production modes @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 in our simulation .",
    "there are other possible sm backgrounds , such as @xmath89 and the diboson production @xmath90 .",
    "but for @xmath89 , the mistag rate of a light jet as a @xmath21-jet in current atlas and cms analyses is of the order of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , depending on the working point of the @xmath21-tagging algorithm .",
    "the acceptance of this background after cuts is found to be negligibly small . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath90 backgrounds can also be neglected because of their small cross sections and the difficulty of faking a @xmath93 final state in @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 backgrounds .     and the transverse mass of the lepton plus missing energy system @xmath97 .",

    "[ fig : mtw ] , we present the distributions of the transverse missing energy @xmath100 and the transverse mass of the lepton plus missing energy system @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear that the backgrounds and the signal can be discriminated by @xmath100 .",
    "most events of the backgrounds are distributed in the region @xmath101 .",
    "however , the signal has much more events than backgrounds in the region @xmath102 , due to the extra missing energy from the massive lsp . besides , the variable @xmath97 can well separate the backgrounds and signal because it has an end - point at the mass of the lepton s parent particle , @xmath103  @xcite .",
    "all the main backgrounds contain a @xmath104 boson and a unique source of missing energy , the neutrino , coming from its decay .",
    "so the backgrounds have endpoint around @xmath105 in the @xmath97 distributions .",
    "but the signal has a larger value of @xmath106 .",
    "a cut on @xmath107 will greatly reduce the backgrounds while keep most of the signal .    , but for the distribution of the opening angle @xmath4 between the charged lepton and the @xmath21-jet in the lab - frame.,width=384,height=336 ]    another interesting observable is the opening angle @xmath108 between the charged lepton and the @xmath21-jet in the lab - frame . after requiring exactly one lepton and one @xmath21-jet , we display the distribution of @xmath4 in fig .  [",
    "fig : cos ] .",
    "we can see that most of the signal events fall in the region of @xmath109 , while the backgrounds have more events in the region of @xmath110 .",
    "this is because the the charged lepton and the @xmath21-quark from top quark in the stop decays are boosted so that they tend to move in the same direction when the mass splitting between @xmath111 and @xmath1 is large .",
    "thus , the requirement of a large @xmath4 can further reduce backgrounds .",
