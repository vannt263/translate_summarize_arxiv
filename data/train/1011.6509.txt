    "in typical phase  i studies in the development of relatively benign drugs , the drug is initiated at low doses and subsequently escalated to show safety at a level where some positive response occurs , and healthy volunteers are used as study subjects .",
    "this paradigm does not work for diseases like cancer , for which a non - negligible probability of severe toxic reaction has to be accepted to give the patient some chance of a favorable response to the treatment .",
    "moreover , in many such situations , the benefits of a new therapy may not be known for a long time after enrollment , but toxicities manifest themselves in a relatively short time period .",
    "therefore , patients ( rather than healthy volunteers ) are used as study subjects , and given the hoped - for ( rather than observed ) benefit for them , one aims at an acceptable level of toxic response in determining the dose .",
    "current designs for phase  i cancer trials , which are sequential in nature , are an ad hoc attempt to reconcile the objective of finding a _ maximum tolerated dose _ ( mtd ) with stringent ethical demands for protecting the study subjects from toxicities in excess of what they can tolerate .",
    "it treats groups of three patients sequentially , starting with the smallest of an ordered set of doses .",
    "escalation occurs if no toxicity is observed in all three patients ; otherwise an additional three patients are treated at the same dose level .",
    "if only one of the six patients has toxicity , escalation again continues ; otherwise the trial stops , with the lower dose declared as mtd . as pointed out by storer ( @xcite ) , these designs , commonly referred to as 3-plus-3 designs , are difficult to analyze , since even a strict quantitative definition of mtd is lacking , `` although it should be taken to mean some percentile of a tolerance distribution with respect to some objective definition of clinical toxicity , '' and the `` implicitly intended '' percentile seems to be the 33rd percentile ( related to 2@xmath16 ) .",
    "storer ( @xcite ) also considered three other `` up - and - down '' sequential designs for quantile estimation in the bioassay literature and performed simulationstudies of their performance in estimating the 33rd percentile .",
    "subsequent simulation studies byoquigley et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed the performance of these designs to be `` dismal , '' for which they provided the following explanation : `` not only do ( these designs ) not make efficient use of accumulated data , they make use of no such data at all , beyond say the previous three , or sometimes six , responses . ''",
    "they proposed an alternative design , called the _ continual reassessment method _ ( crm ) , which uses parametric modeling of the dose  response relationship and a bayesian approach to estimate the mtd or , more generally , the dose level @xmath2 such that the probability @xmath3 of a toxic event is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 in the case of mtd ) .    letting @xmath6 and assuming the usual logistic model @xmath7 for the probability of a toxic response at dose level  @xmath2 , the problem of optimal choice of @xmath8 dose levels to estimate the mtd seems to be covered by the theory of nonlinear designs .",
    "a well - known difficulty in nonlinear design theory is that the optimal design for parameter estimation involves the unknown parameter vector . to circumvent the difficulty",
    ", it has been proposed that the design be constructed sequentially , using observations made to date to estimate @xmath9 by maximum likelihood and choosing the next design point by using the mle to replace the unknown parameter value in the optimal design ; see fedorov ( @xcite ) .",

    "( @xcite ) pointed out that the symmetric nature of squared error loss used by crm may not be appropriate for modeling the toxic response to a cancer treatment .",
    "they proposed the _",
    "escalation with overdose control _ ( ewoc ) method , which uses an asymmetric linear loss function that penalizes dose level @xmath21 for @xmath22 , corresponding to an overdose , more than an under - dose @xmath23 . whereas crm is equivalent to estimating the mtd at each stage by the mean of the posterior distribution of @xmath10 , ewoc is equivalent to estimating the mtd at each stage by the @xmath24th quantile of the posterior distribution of @xmath10 , where @xmath25 is the so - called _ feasibility bound _ , usually chosen to be slightly less than @xmath4 .",
    "there has also been much work on designs intended to give an accurate post - experiment estimate of the @xmath26 or other functions of the unknown parameter vector @xmath9 . for example ,",
    "locally optimal designs such as @xmath0- and @xmath27-optimal designs have been investigated extensively for binary responses , and because a nonlinear model s information matrix for binary data is a function of the unknown parameters , locally optimal designs are usually applied using initial estimates , multistage methods or bayesian priors .",
    "haines , perevozskaya and rosenberger ( @xcite ) proposed a two - stage design whose first stage is a locally optimal design based on a chosen prior , which is then updated sequentially during its second stage . a comparative study of these methods is given in section  [ sec:2stage ] .",
    "since the parameter @xmath9 is unknown , _ active _ statistical learning involves setting the doses at levels that give maximum information about the function of the unknown parameters of interest , the mtd , and how to do this is a problem in nonlinear experimental design theory ( abdelbasit and plackett , @xcite ; dette et  al . , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is also an ethical issue of treating patients in the phase  i trial at dose levels below the unknown mtd for safety , and hopefully close to the mtd for efficacy .",
    "this dilemma between treatment of current patients and efficient experimentation to gather information for future patients was articulated by lai and robbins ( @xcite ) in a simple linear regression model @xmath28 , where , instead of the mtd , the desired level is @xmath29 , for some given value @xmath30 . whereas an asymptotic theory of how this dilemma can be resolved optimally as @xmath31 was developed by lai and robbins ( @xcite ) , it was quite recent that a tractable scheme was developed by han , lai and spivakovsky ( @xcite ) to compute an approximately optimal solution for finite sample size @xmath8 ( number of patients enrolled in the trial ) .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce a basic stochastic optimization problem that incorporates the treatment versus experimentation dilemma in the design of phase  i cancer trials .",

    "although ( [ 13 ] ) says that rolling out a base design can improve it and rolling out @xmath8 times yields the dynamic programming solution , in practice , it is difficult to use a rollout ( which is defined by a backward induction algorithm that involves monte carlo simulations followed by numerical optimization at every stage ) as the base policy for another rollout . to overcome this difficulty , we need a tractable representation of successive rollouts , which we develop by using other ideas from approximate dynamic programming ( adp ) .      the conditional expectation in ( [ 10 ] ) , as a function of @xmath2 , is called the _ cost - to - go function _ in dynamic programming .",

    "although the problem ( [ 10 ] ) can be viewed as a markov decision problem with the @xmath141-posterior distribution being the state @xmath116 , the state space of the markov chain at hand is infinite - dimensional , consisting of all bivariate posterior distributions of the unknown parameter vector @xmath47 .",
    "if the state space were finite - dimensional , for example , @xmath142 , then one could approximate the value functions ( [ eq : argmin ] ) by commonly used basis functions in nonparametric regression , such as regression splines and their tensor products ; see hastie , tibshirani and friedman ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the infinite - dimensional case , there is no such simple choice of basis functions of posterior distributions , which are the states .",
    "as pointed out in section  6.7 of bertsekas ( @xcite ) , an alternative to approximating the value functions @xmath135 , called _ approximation in value space _ , is to approximate the optimal policy by a parametric family of policies so that the total cost can be optimized over the parameter vector .",

    ".    the choice of the family of policies should involve domain knowledge and reflect the kind of policies that one would like to use for the actual application .",

    "we explore this technique in the context of phase  i designs , using such perturbations  called here _ hybrid designs_both as base policies and as a way to represent highly complicated but efficient policies in a simple , clinically useful way . as pointed out in section  [ sec : globrisk ] , the objective function of the dynamic programming problem ( [ 8 ] ) involves both experimentation ( for estimating the mtd ) and treatment ( for the patients in the study ) .",

    "on the other hand , early on in the trial , especially if @xmath162 is relatively large , one expects the optimal dose to be perturbed from @xmath160 in the direction of a dose that provides more information about the dose  response model , for the relatively large number of doses that will have to be set for the future patients .",
    "since the optimal design theory for learning the mtd under overdose constraints , developed by haines , perevozskaya and rosenberger ( @xcite ) , yields a @xmath0- or @xmath27-optimal design @xmath163 , we propose to use the following _ hybrid design _ representation of the optimal dose sequence : @xmath164 where @xmath163 is the chosen `` learning design .

    "this has the following connections to the stochastic optimization problem of lai and robbins ( @xcite ) discussed in section  [ sec1 ] and to the rollout procedure of han , lai and spivakovsky ( @xcite ) . for the normal model discussed in section  [ sec1 ] and as an asymptotic limiting case of other models , sacks ( @xcite ) showed that the optimal value of the step size ( a user - supplied parameter in the lai  robbins procedure affecting its convergence rate ) is proportional to @xmath185 .",
    "moreover , han , lai and spivakovsky ( @xcite ) , section  3 , found that in the normal model , perturbations of the myopic policy in the direction of this @xmath0-optimal design provide a base design for a rollout that has comparable performance to that of an `` oracle policy . ''",
    "since the treatment versus experimentationdilemma discussed in section  [ sec2 ] stems from the uncertainty in the current estimate of the mtd @xmath46 , it is natural to expect that the amount of perturbation from the myopic dose @xmath160 depends on the degree of such uncertainty , using little perturbation when the posterior distribution of @xmath46 is peaked , and much more perturbation when it is spread out .",
    "this suggests choosing @xmath166 as a function of the posterior variance @xmath187 , whose reciprocal is called the `` precision '' of @xmath186 in bayesian parlance . following the approach described in section  [ sec : lsmc ] , we use functions of @xmath188 as basic features of the posterior distribution of @xmath46 to approximate the @xmath166 in  ( [ 14 ] ) .",

    "this seems to be because the number  10 of dose levels was a fortuitous choice given the parameter values and sample size of this study , allowing the @xmath243 design to escalate to near the mtd in most cases . however , there is often little information about the appropriate number of doses and scale before aphase  i cancer trial begins , and when dose levels are chosen over a less fortuitous range or on too fine a scale , as with the @xmath244 design , the majority of doses can end up being administered at levels far below the therapeutic range near the mtd .",
    "we emphasize that all of these designs are being evaluated using the ewoc loss function in ( [ 7 ] ) which , in particular for crm , differs from its associated loss function ; using the crm loss function in ( [ 7 ] ) results in crm having smaller global risk than ewoc , but again roll ( with crm as its base design ) yields smaller global risk than both and the relationship between the other designs remains roughly unchanged .    in terms of mtd estimation accuracy , crm and wu",
    "have the smallest rmse , closely followed by @xmath0-opt and roll ; crm and wu also have the smallest absolute bias .",
    "it is interesting to note that the designs which explicitly account for the asymmetric underdose / overdose relationship , that is , roll , ewoc and @xmath27-opt ( through its overdose constraint  @xmath255 ) , are negatively biased , while the others all have positive bias .    in terms of safety , @xmath27-opt and the @xmath256 designs have the smallest dlt and od rates , but in view of their large risk values , this safety comes at the cost of low doses that are nontherapeutic .",

    "despite their shortcomings and the development of alternative bayesian approaches since 1990 , conventional dose - escalation designs are still widely used in phase  i cancer trials because of the ethical issue of safe treatment of patients currently in the trial . however , a phase  i design also has the goal of determining the mtd for a future phase  ii cancer trial , and needs an informative experimental design to meet this goal .",
