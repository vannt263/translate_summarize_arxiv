    "it is well known that in high - energy deep - inelastic @xmath1-collisions a large fraction of the observed events are diffractive .",

[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the presence of a hard scale , as for example the photon virtuality @xmath9 in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) or the large transverse jet momentum @xmath10 in the photon - proton center - of - momentum frame , should then allow for calculations of the production cross section for the central system @xmath8 with the known methods of perturbative qcd . under this assumption",

    "+ the diffractive pdfs have been determined by the h1 collaboration at hera from high - precision inclusive measurements of the dis process @xmath12 using the usual dglap evolution equations in leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and the well - known formula for the inclusive cross section as a convolution of the inclusive parton - level cross section with the diffractive pdfs @xcite . for",
    "a similar analysis of the inclusive measurements of the zeus collaboration see @xcite . for inclusive diffractive dis",
    "it has been proven by collins that the formula referred to above is applicable without additional corrections and that the inclusive jet production cross section for large @xmath13 can be calculated in terms of the same diffractive pdfs @xcite .",
    "the proof of this factorization formula , usually referred to as the validity of qcd factorization in hard diffraction , also appears to be valid for the direct part of photoproduction ( @xmath14 ) or low-@xmath13 electroproduction of jets @xcite .",
    "however , factorization does not hold for hard processes in diffractive hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "the problem is that soft interactions between the ingoing two hadrons and their remnants occur in both the initial and final state .",
    "this agrees with experimental measurements at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "predictions of diffractive dijet cross sections for @xmath15 collisions as measured by cdf using the same pdfs as determined by h1 @xcite overestimate the measured cross section by up to an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this suppression of the cdf cross section can be explained by considering the rescattering of the two incoming hadron beams which , by creating additional hadrons , destroy the rapidity gap @xcite .",
    "+    processes with real photons ( @xmath16 ) or virtual photons with fixed , but low @xmath13 involve direct interactions of the photon with quarks from the proton as well as resolved photon contributions , leading to parton - parton interactions and an additional remnant jet coming from the photon ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "as already said , factorization should be valid for direct interactions as in the case of dis , whereas it is expected to fail for the resolved process similar as in the hadron - hadron scattering process .",
    "in a two - channel eikonal model similar to the one used to calculate the suppression factor in hadron - hadron processes @xcite , introducing vector - meson dominated photon fluctuations , a suppression by about a factor of three for resolved photoproduction at hera is predicted @xcite .",
    "such a suppression factor has recently been applied to diffractive dijet photoproduction @xcite and compared to preliminary data from h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite .",
    "while at lo no suppression of the resolved contribution seemed to be necessary , the nlo corrections increase the cross section significantly , showing that factorization breaking occurs at this order for resolved photoproduction and that a suppression factor @xmath17 , in agreement with the prediction of @xcite , gives a reasonable description of the experimental data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ as already mentioned in our earlier work @xcite , describing the factorization breaking in hard photoproduction as well as in electroproduction at very low @xmath13 @xcite by suppressing the resolved contribution only may be problematic .",
    "an indication for this is the fact that the separation between the direct and the resolved process is uniquely defined only in lo . in nlo",
    "these two processes are related .",
    "the separation depends on the factorization scheme and the factorization scale @xmath0 .",
    "the sum of both cross sections is the only physically relevant cross section , which is approximately independent of the factorization scheme and scale @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated already in @xcite that by multiplying the resolved cross section with the suppression factor @xmath17 , the correlation of the @xmath0-dependence between the direct and resolved part is destroyed and the sum of both parts has a stronger @xmath0-dependence than for the unsuppressed case ( @xmath18 ) , where the @xmath0-dependence of the nlo direct cross section is compensated to a high degree against the @xmath0-dependence of the lo resolved part .",
    "the introduction of the resolved cross section is dictated by perturbation theory . at nlo ,",
    "collinear singularities arise from the photon initial state , which are absorbed at the factorization scale into the photon pdfs . this way the photon pdfs become @xmath0-dependent .",
    "the equivalent @xmath0-dependence , just with the opposite sign , is left in the nlo corrections to the direct contribution . with this knowledge , it is obvious that we can obtain a physical cross section at nlo , _",

    "+ it is the purpose of this paper to present the special form of the @xmath20-term in the nlo direct contribution and then , after multiplying it with the suppression factor @xmath21 , to demonstrate that the @xmath0-dependence of the physical cross section cancels to a large extent in the same way as in the unsuppressed case ( @xmath18 ) , if we modify the suppression mechanism in the way as explained above . of course",

    "we see that the @xmath0-dependence in the considered    range decreases with increasing @xmath13 .",

    "i.e. _ has no suppression factor , it was suggested in @xcite , that one possibility to avoid the non - compensation of the @xmath0-dependence between the suppressed resolved cross section and the unsuppressed direct cross section would be to suppress only the hadron - like and the gluon part of the pdfs .",
    "fortunately , in the sas - type photon pdfs the hadron - like and the anomalous part and the effect of their evolution are presented separately , so that the effect of the suppression of the hadron - like part can be investigated for all scales .",

    ", this fraction is @xmath89 , and it decreases strongly with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "this means that the anomalous component dominates the total resolved cross section and a suppression of the hadron - like part alone would not be sufficient to account for the experimental data at low @xmath13 .",
    "although in the case of photoproduction ( @xmath16 ) the hadron - like part is supposed to be larger , it would be quite artificial to have two different mechanisms for the @xmath0-scale compensation depending on whether @xmath90 or @xmath16 .",
    "for this reason we prefer the mechanism with the suppression in the dir@xmath67 contribution to the nlo corrections of the direct cross section , which works for all @xmath13 .",
    "in summary , we propose in this paper a new factorization scheme for diffractive production of jets in low-@xmath13 deep inelastic scattering . by suppressing not only the resolved photon contribution , but also the unresummed logarithm as well as scheme - dependent finite terms in the nlo direct initial state correction ,",
    "factorization scheme and scale invariance is restored up to higher order effects , while at the same time the cut - off invariance required in phase space slicing methods is preserved .",
    "+ for pedagogical reasons , we have chosen in this paper the kinematical region of finite , but low photon virtuality @xmath13 , which exposes and regularizes a logarithmic virtual photon initial state singularity .",
    "we do , however , not rely on the finiteness of @xmath13 , but rather separate suppressed and unsuppressed terms using the hard transverse momentum scale @xmath91 , so that our scheme is equally valid for real photoproduction .",
    "furthermore , due to the universality of the initial state singularity , our new factorization scheme should apply to any other diffractive photon - induced process with a second hard scale , such as inclusive hadron - production at large @xmath91 or heavy quark and quarkonium production .",
    "+ the scheme- and scale invariance has been demonstrated numerically using the kinematics of a recent h1 analysis , differential in @xmath13 and parton momentum fraction in the pomeron @xmath26 .",
    "very good stability with respect to scheme- and scale variations and good agreement with the experimental data has been found .",
    "+ individual studies of the anomalous and hadronic component of the resolved virtual photon show that the parton densities in the virtual photon are dominated by the resummed pointlike component , as expected from non - diffractive deep inelastic scattering . while suppressing only the hadronic component in the photon pdfs",
    "would also be scheme- and scale - invariant and therefore be theoretically consistent , our numerical study shows that this alternative is thus phenomenologically not viable .",

    "<S> we calculate diffractive dijet production in deep - inelastic scattering at next - to - leading order of perturbative qcd , including contributions from direct and resolved photons , and compare our predictions to preliminary data from the h1 collaboration at hera . </S>",
    "<S> we study how the cross section depends on the factorization scheme and scale @xmath0 at the virtual photon vertex for the occurrence of factorization breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the strong @xmath0-dependence , which is present when only the resolved cross section is suppressed , is tamed by introducing the suppression also into the initial - state nlo correction of the direct part .    </S>",
