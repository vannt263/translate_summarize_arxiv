    "the solar neutrino spectrum is currently being explored by four underground experiments : the pioneering homestake ( chlorine ) detector @xcite , the kamiokande ( water - cherenkov ) detector @xcite , and two gallium detectors , gallex @xcite and sage @xcite .",
    "these first - generation experiments have shown that the observed solar neutrino event rates are lower than expected @xcite , giving rise to `` solar neutrino problems '' @xcite that can not be solved within the standard experimental and theoretical understanding of the physics of the sun and of the electroweak interactions .",
    "bahcall @xcite has shown that the @xmath0b@xmath1be ( allowed ) decay produces the same shape for the ( @xmath0b ) neutrino spectrum , up to gravitational redshift corrections of @xmath8 , independent of whether the neutrinos are created in a terrestrial laboratory or in the center of the sun .",
    "thus , experimental evidence for a deviation of the @xmath0b solar neutrino spectrum from the laboratory shape would constitute evidence for physics beyond the standard model of the electroweak interactions . indeed , powerful new experiments , such as the superkamiokande @xcite , the sno @xcite , and the icarus @xcite detectors , will measure the _ shape _ of the high - energy ( @xmath9 mev ) part of the solar neutrino spectrum , which originates from the beta - decay of @xmath0b produced in the sun .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath0b solar neutrino spectrum dates back to 1964 , when it was pointed out @xcite that the usual @xmath10-decay allowed spectrum should be averaged over the intermediate @xmath11 states of @xmath0be , as derived by the subsequent alpha - decay @xmath0be@xmath2 .",
    "experimental evidence for this smearing was found 23 years later in the associated positron spectrum @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the spectrum has been continually improved by bahcall and collaborators in @xcite , to which we refer the conscientious reader for all the details not reported here .",
    "the independent calculation of the @xmath0b neutrino spectrum by j.  napolitano _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also compares well with the results in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the evaluation of the @xmath0b solar neutrino spectrum is further improved , using recently available experimental data and new theoretical calculations .",
    "moreover , the maximum uncertainties ( @xmath12 effective standard deviations ) that can affect the best estimated spectrum are determined .",
    "the inferred spectral shape is presented numerically and graphically , in forms useful for fits to experimental results and for phenomenological analyses .",
    "the neutrino spectra , together with new data on the gamow  teller strengths in the @xmath4 system , are used to improve the calculations of the @xmath0b neutrino absorption cross sections for chlorine and for gallium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the available experimental data on the @xmath0b@xmath1be@xmath2 decay chain are reviewed and discussed , in order to extract an optimal data set and in order to evaluate the experimental uncertainties . in sec .",
    "iii the best neutrino spectrum is calculated , including the appropriate radiative corrections .",
    "the total ( theoretical and experimental ) uncertainties are used to calculate a `` @xmath13 '' and a `` @xmath14 '' spectrum , characterizing the maximum deviations from the optimal spectrum . in sec .",
    "iv these spectra are applied to a refined calculation of the @xmath0b neutrino absorption cross sections for @xmath15cl and for @xmath16ga .",
    "a summary of the work is presented in sec .",
    "in this section , we present a compilation of the available experimental data on beta and alpha decay of @xmath0b . then the various @xmath17-decay data are compared and used to fit the @xmath10-decay data .",
    "the best - fit alpha spectrum and its @xmath3 range emerge naturally from this overconstrained comparison .",
    "the @xmath10-decay of @xmath0b populates @xmath11 states in @xmath0be , which then breaks up into two @xmath17-particles @xcite .",
    "the energy levels are shown in fig .  1 . the @xmath10 , @xmath17 and correlated @xmath10-@xmath17 spectra have been investigated by several experimental groups .",
    "in addition to the solar neutrino application , this decay chain is of special interest because the @xmath18 nuclear isotriplet ( li ,  be ,  b ) can be used to search for violations of the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis or for the existence of second - class currents ( scc ) ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite ) , and is also an interesting subject for @xmath19-matrix analyses @xcite .    for the determination of the @xmath0b ( solar ) neutrino spectrum ,",
    "a single precise determination of the alpha spectrum is , in principle , all that is required . in practice , we take advantage of the redundancy of the available experimental information to estimate both a preferred alpha spectrum and the possible uncertainties .      the most recent determination of @xmath0b @xmath10-decay spectrum is reported ( graphically ) in @xcite .",
    "the original number of detected counts in each of the 33 channels used ( for momentum @xmath20 mev ) have been made available by one of us ( j.n . ) . we discuss below in detail the energy calibration of the @xmath10 decay data of @xcite , for its particular relevance to the present work .",
    "the calibration procedure used in @xcite was similar to that in @xcite , which employed the same spectrograph to determine the weak magnetism correction to the @xmath21b @xmath10-spectrum shape . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath21b spectrum itself was used to set the calibration .",
    "the @xmath21b source was produced through the @xmath22b@xmath23 reaction , with the spectrograph fixed at the same field setting used for the @xmath0b data .",
    "the momentum measurement was in channels corresponding to a position along the focal plane .",
    "prior studies of the spectrograph @xcite demonstrated good linearity between momentum and position .",
    "the @xmath21b raw data ( @xmath24  counts ) were collected in 36 momentum bins .",
    "the data were fitted with the standard allowed @xmath10-decay spectrum , along with the known recoil order corrections ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "both the normalization and the offset in the position relative to the radius of curvature were left free in the fit .",
    "the simultaneous minimization of @xmath25 with respect to these two parameters yielded a good fit @xmath26 , and showed no evidence for a systematic deviation in the residuals .",
    "the error in the absolute momentum calibration was estimated to be less than @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "our conservative estimate for the maximum @xmath29 uncertainty in the energy calibration of the @xmath10-decay data in @xcite is @xmath30 mev .",
    "this value corresponds to three times a @xmath31 error at the endpoint energy , @xmath32 mev .",
    "as we will see , the @xmath10-decay spectrum data of @xcite play a fundamental role in constraining the uncertainties of the neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "attempts to confirm the positron spectrum data , including measurements at lower momenta , would be helpful .",
    "unfortunately , existing additional data on the @xmath0b @xmath10-decay as reported ( only graphically ) in @xmath10-@xmath17 correlation searches @xcite are too sparse to be useful for our purposes .",
    "figure  2 shows our compilation of the experimental data for the delayed @xmath17-spectrum .",
    "the measurements with the highest statistics have been performed by wilkinson and alburger @xcite , using both a thick and a thin catcher ( wa1 and wa2 in fig .  2 , respectively ) .",
    "for our purposes , it is sufficient to know that the typical energy loss of @xmath17-particles is @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) kev in the thick ( thin ) catcher .",
    "the wa1 data ( @xmath35 counts ) have been reported by warburton @xcite , together with the proper channel - energy calibration formula .",
    "barker @xcite has described similarly the wa2 data ( @xmath36 counts ) .",
    "an older measurement of the @xmath17 spectrum was performed by farmer and class @xcite , although reported only in a graphical form ( fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum labeled `` fc '' in fig .",
    "2 corresponds to a digitized form of their data ( @xmath37 counts ) .",
    "a high - statistics data set has been also collected by one of us ( l.deb . ) and d.  wright , in the course of a recent experimental search for cvc violation and scc effects in the @xmath18 multiplet @xcite .",
    "these data ( @xmath38 counts ) are labeled as `` dbw '' in fig .  2 .    in all of the @xmath17-decay measurements we use , the experimentalists devoted considerable attention to the @xmath17-energy calibration , and in particular to the accurate estimate of the energy loss in the target .",
    "the spectra were corrected by the experimentalists for calibration and energy loss effects .",
    "we do not use the @xmath17-spectrum measured by clark _",
    "_ in @xcite , since data can not be extracted from their fig .  2 with sufficient precision to be useful for our purposes .    the spectra in fig",
    "2 are peaked at @xmath39 mev and decrease very rapidly for @xmath40 ( notice the logarithmic scale ) . at @xmath41 mev ,",
    "the spectral values are decreased by a factor @xmath42 .",
    "the interval @xmath41 mev contains @xmath43 of the experimental counts for each data set .",
    "therefore the `` tails '' of the spectra ( @xmath44 mev and @xmath45 mev contribute only @xmath46 to the smearing of the endpoint energies in the calculation of the neutrino or positron spectra from @xmath0b decay .      a close inspection of fig .",
    "2 reveals that the four different @xmath17-decay spectra wa1 , wa2 , fc and dbw have slightly displaced peaks , with a total spread in the peak energies of about @xmath47 mev .",
    "indeed , the largest uncertainty in these spectra can be ascribed to a possible bias @xmath48 in the measured alpha - particle energy : @xmath49 . if the intermediate @xmath11 state at 3.04 mev ( see fig .",
    "1 ) were a narrow resonance , then @xmath48 could be taken as a constant bias . in general , @xmath48 may depend on @xmath50 , since in fact the intermediate state is not very narrow ; thus the bias might assume slightly different values at the peak or in the tails of the @xmath17-decay spectra .",
    "however , in the calculation of the @xmath0b neutrino spectrum the @xmath17-spectrum tails are much less important than the peak region ( @xmath51 mev ) , so that @xmath48 is assumed to be a constant @xmath52 for our purposes .",
    "for the spectra wa1 and wa2 , barker has given in @xcite a thorough discussion and an estimate of the possible contributions to @xmath48 , including uncertainties due to energy loss , calibration , and finite resolution .",
    "a succint summary of barker s analysis is that @xmath53 mev at @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , for the spectrum wa2 ( thin catcher ) , two possible channel - energy calibration formulae are presented in @xcite [ see eq .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 15 ) therein ] , which differ by @xmath54 mev in the alpha - energy peak . the first calibration [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) in barker s paper ] has been used in connection with the spectrum wa2 shown in fig .  2 ; the second calibration will be used below for a further check of the sensitivity of the inferred spectrum to possible systematic uncertainties . for the dbw spectrum ,",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath50 is estimated to be of comparable magnitude ( @xmath55 mev ) @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty is larger ( @xmath56 mev ) for the older fc spectrum @xcite , in part as a result of the necessity of converting to graphical data .",
    "each of the four @xmath17-particle data sets can be used to estimate the theoretical positron spectrum in @xmath0b@xmath1be decay .",
    "the ingredients of this calculation are the same as for the neutrino spectrum , except for the radiative corrections .",
    "in fact , in beta - decay the radiative corrections take a different form according to whether the @xmath10-particle , or the neutrino , is detected . in the first case , they have been computed by sirlin @xcite . in the second case , they have been recently evaluated by batkin and sundaresan @xcite , and will be discussed later ( in sec .",
    "iii ) . the computed positron spectrum , including radiative corrections ,",
    "is then compared to the experimental @xmath10-decay data ( 33 points ) as in @xcite .",
    "the total number of counts collected ( @xmath57 ) is used for normalization , reducing the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath58 ) to 32 . a normalized @xmath59 ( @xmath60 )",
    "is then calculated for each input @xmath17 spectrum , and this exercise is repeated also by shifting the experimental @xmath17-energy values ( @xmath49 ) . in the calculation of @xmath59",
    "we include the statistical errors of the @xmath10-decay data but exclude , in first approximation , their energy calibration uncertainty @xmath61 ( sec .",
    "the effect of this additional uncertainty is discussed at the end of this section .",
    "figure  3 shows , for each of the four measured @xmath17-particle spectra , the normalized @xmath25-fit to the measured positron spectrum as a function of the assumed @xmath17-particle energy bias . for zero energy bias ( vertical dashed line ) the fc , dbw , wa2 , and wa1 data provide increasingly good fits to the beta - decay spectrum .",
    "when an allowance for a non - zero bias @xmath48 is made , all the four alpha - spectra provide equally good fits ( @xmath62 ) , modulo the shift @xmath49 . the dotted curve , which also provides a good fit for zero bias , corresponds to the spectrum wa2 using the second barker s calibration @xcite .",
    "the main difference among the four @xmath17-particle data sets can thus be ascribed to small biases in the measured @xmath17-energies .",
    "the natural choice for the optimal @xmath17-particle energy spectrum is seen to be , in fig .",
    "3 , wa1 with @xmath63 mev .",
    "this is our choice for the experimental input data in the calculation of the `` best '' neutrino spectrum .",
    "an additional variation of @xmath48 equal to @xmath64 mev produces a @xmath65 increase in the fit to the @xmath66 spectrum , defining a @xmath3 range for @xmath48 .",
    "we have studied the sensitivity of the @xmath25-fit to the low - statistics bins by excluding up to 10 bins in the high - energy part of the positron spectrum ; the highest - energy bins represent @xmath67 of the experimental counts .",
    "the central values of the bias @xmath48 in these fits ( excluding some or all of the 10 highest - energy bins ) are spread by @xmath68 mev around @xmath69 mev , with a @xmath70 error that can be as large as 0.047 mev when all the 10 bins are excluded .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test provides a non - parametric ( bin - free ) way of determining the goodness of fit of two distributions .",
    "we have therefore applied a k - s test to the best - fit ( unbinned ) normalized spectrum .",
    "we obtain a @xmath70 error of @xmath71 mev for the bias @xmath48 .",
    "we adopt this error , @xmath71 mev , as a conservative but relevant @xmath70 estimate .",
    "figure  4 shows the experimental beta - decay spectrum @xcite ( dots with @xmath28 statistical error bars ) , the best - fit theoretical spectrum ( solid curve , obtained by using wa1 data with @xmath69 mev ) , and the `` @xmath3 '' theoretical spectra ( dotted curves , wa1 data with @xmath72 mev ) .    as discussed in sec .",
    "ii.a , the @xmath10-decay reference spectrum is affected by a maximum energy calibration uncertainty @xmath73 mev ( 3@xmath74 ) .",
    "an error @xmath75 corresponds to an error @xmath76 in the @xmath0b@xmath1be@xmath2 decay chain . as a consequence ,",
    "the total range of the @xmath17-energy bias @xmath48 gets slightly enlarged : @xmath77 mev , where the two ( independent ) errors have been added in quadrature .",
    "the estimated @xmath3 range for @xmath48 ( @xmath78 mev ) is approximately equal to the spread in the peaks of the experimental alpha - decay spectra ( @xmath47 mev ) discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "in this section , the main results of the present paper are presented : a best ( standard ) @xmath0b neutrino spectrum @xmath79 , together with two supplementary spectra , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , obtained by stretching the total uncertainties to their @xmath3 limits .",
    "these spectra are given both in figures and in tables .",
    "the effects of the individual experimental and theoretical uncertainties are also discussed and illustrated graphically .",
    "the successive calculations of the @xmath0b normalized neutrino spectrum @xmath79 included  besides the phase space factor @xcite  the intermediate state smearing @xcite , the proper fermi function @xcite , and the forbidden corrections to the allowed transition @xcite .",
    "napolitano _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out the potential relevance of radiative corrections , although only those corresponding to the @xmath0b _ positron _ spectrum @xcite were known at the time . here",
    "we include the appropriate radiative corrections to the @xmath0b _ neutrino _ spectrum that have been recently calculated in @xcite .",
    "these corrections are smaller ( due to a cancellation between real and virtual photon contributions @xcite ) , and with a milder energy dependence , than the corrections that apply when the charged lepton is detected in @xmath10-decay @xcite .",
    "as we shall see below , their inclusion makes no significant difference in the calculation .",
    "the optimal input alpha - decay data , as discussed in the previous section , are taken as wa1 with an energy bias @xmath48 having a central value of @xmath82 mev and a @xmath3 experimental uncertainty @xmath83 mev ( determined by the fit to the @xmath10-decay data ) .",
    "we anticipate ( see below ) that the inclusion of the maximal theoretical uncertainties can be mimicked by enlarging the above range to @xmath84 mev .",

    "these deviations are similar to sinusoidal curves , with a maximum amplitude of @xmath101 .",
    "the average value of the absolute deviation is thus @xmath102 at @xmath70 .",
    "the difference between the bahcall and holstein @xcite spectrum @xmath103 and the best - fit spectrum @xmath90 can also be represented well by a sinusoidal curve ( like those shown in fig .",
    "the amplitude of the difference @xmath104 is @xmath105 , to be compared with the effective @xmath70 differences @xmath106 shown in fig .",
    "9 . similarly ,",
    "the difference between the spectrum @xmath107 calculated by j.  napolitano _ et al . _ in @xcite and the standard spectrum @xmath90 is about @xmath108 .",
    "notice that the curve fc in fig .",
    "9 is somewhat irregular and `` out of phase '' ( about @xmath109 of a semiperiod ) with respect to the @xmath3 sinusoids . the irregularity is due to the scatter of the fc data points .",
    "the dephasing can be traced back to the fact that the fc data set has very few low - energy counts , being limited to @xmath110 mev .",
    "we have verified that the curve fc in fig .",

    "we have also computed neutrino spectra with `` mixed alpha data , '' namely with wa1 data for @xmath111 matched to dbw data for @xmath112 ( and viceversa ) .",
    "we found that the spectral differences can always be reabsorbed in a uniform bias @xmath48 to a very good approximation , with residual differences of @xmath113 mev with respect to the `` unmixed '' original data .",
    "we conclude that the low - energy part of the experimental alpha - decay spectrum ( that affects particularly the high - energy tail of the neutrino spectrum ) is sufficiently well known for our purposes , and that the alpha spectra uncertainties can be effectively parametrized as a uniform energy offset @xmath48 .",
    "the effects of radical assumptions about the correctness of the theoretical calculations beyond the ( phase space)@xmath114(fermi function ) approximation are shown in fig .",

    "the curves labeled 1 and 2 represent the shifts @xmath97 obtained by setting to zero the forbidden or the radiative corrections , respectively . for curve 3 , the radiative corrections were ( inappropriately ) assumed to be the same as for the positron detection case @xcite ( as was also done in @xcite ) ; the present exercise is intended to account roughly for a hypothetical situation in which the cancellation between real and virtual photon contribution might not be as effective as computed in @xcite .    the maximum theoretical deviation ( curve 1 in fig .",
    "10 ) is obtained by excluding the forbidden corrections altogether .",
    "we have verified that this deviation can be mimicked by recalculating the neutrino energy spectrum with an additional energy bias , @xmath115 mev .",
    "this value is comparable to the estimated @xmath70 experimental uncertainty evaluated in sec .",
    "ii  c , @xmath116 .",
    "we assume that the maximum theoretical offset , @xmath117 , corresponds to an `` effective '' @xmath70 statistical significance .",
    "our final best - estimate for the bias @xmath48 to be applied to the reference wa1 @xmath17-decay spectrum is therefore : @xmath118 mev , as anticipated in sec .",
    "the assignment of a `` @xmath70 level of significance '' to the offset that parameterizes the total effect of the forbidden corrections is a plausible estimate .",
    "however , there is no rigorous way to estimate a @xmath70 theoretical uncertainty .",
    "our estimate is motivated by the fact that the calculation of forbidden corrections in beta - decay is not made purely from first principles ( strong and electroweak lagrangian ) , unlike the qed radiative corrections .",
    "the evaluation of the forbidden terms makes use of approximate symmetries to expand the weak nuclear current in terms of a few nuclear form factors , that are evaluated using nuclear models and difficult @xmath10-@xmath17 correlation experiments ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if the reader prefers to adopt a smaller or larger estimate for the theoretical uncertainty , a simple prescription for estimating the changes in the inferred uncertainties is given below .",
    "the prescription is based upon linear error propagation and generally gives agreement with an exact numerical calculation to a fractional accuracy of about 5% or better in the change induced by the rescaling of the error .",
    "recalculate the total @xmath70 range for the bias , @xmath119 , with @xmath120 mev and the reader s preferred estimate for @xmath117 .",

    "a final remark is in order .",
    "the relative contribution of the different @xmath11 states of @xmath0be in the @xmath17-decay spectrum ( see fig .  1 ) has been analyzed by barker @xcite and warburton @xcite within the @xmath19-matrix formalism .",
    "their results are not in complete agreement , the fitted amplitude of the intermediate states being sensitive to the input data ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) . in particular , @xmath19-matrix fits are very sensitive to the absolute energy calibration , as well as to the tails of the alpha - decay spectrum . in our calculation of the neutrino spectrum , the absolute @xmath17-energy is allowed to vary within the quoted uncertainties ( @xmath125 mev ) .",
    "the tails of the alpha decay spectrum are not decisive for our purposes .",
