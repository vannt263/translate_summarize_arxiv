    "in this paper , we study a class of models that combine several mechanisms of dissipation : plasticity , visco - plasticity , visco - elasticity and fracture .",
    "our goal is to investigate whether models from solid mechanics could be pertinent to describe geophysical materials ( and particularly the lithosphere on continental scales ) , as advocated by peltzer and tapponnier @xcite , while others ( see for example  @xcite , @xcite ) prefer descriptions based on fluid mechanics .",
    "the solid mechanics approach would have advantage to account for cracks in the formation of geological faults .",
    "they illustrate their claim with analogue experiments , where a rigid indenter deforms a layer of plasticine , to model the action of the indian sub - continent on the tibetan plateau .",
    "the plasticine experiments seems to reproduce the geophysical scenario of creation of the asian faults and the extrusion of the south - asian block ( including vietnam ) .",
    "no general consensus prevails on the modeling of crack initiation and propagation , even in homogeneous materials .",
    "the popular griffith model , much in use in the engineering community , suffers from various shortcomings .",
    "for instance it does not account for crack nucleation , and assumes pre - determined crack paths . in the last decade , a series of investigation initiated by francfort and marigo @xcite has addressed the mathematical foundation of fracture mechanics , using new concepts that have emerged from the mathematical modeling of composite materials and from the calculus of variation .",
    "this approach postulates that crack evolution is governed by the minimization of a total energy , among all possible crack states .",
    "our models of fracture are inspired by this work , though we only consider fracture via a phase - field approximation .",
    "in other words , the geometry of possible cracks is captured by a function @xmath0 with values between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 in the healthy parts that do not contain cracks .",
    "the length of the cracks , a quantity that contributes to the total energy , is approximated via a functionnal introduced by ambrosio and tortorelli  @xcite and bourdin  @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations of fracture in a purely elastic medium , using such phase - field approximation , was carried out by bourdin , francfort and marigo  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a model combining elasticity , visco - elasticity and fracture regularized via phase - field , is analyzed in  @xcite , where the main point is how to define a consistent evolution as the limit of semi - discrete approximations in time .",
    "our class of models extends this work to the case when plastic behavior and viscoplastic behavior can occur .    from a thermodynamical point of view",
    ", we interpret the phase field function @xmath0 , that tracks the location and propagation of cracks , not only as a variable for numerical approximation , but as a global thermodynamical internal variable .",
    "we show that our models are consistent with thermodynamics , in the sense that they satisfy a clausius - duhem type inequality .",
    "we propose a numerical scheme for a space - time discretization of the evolution , and analyze its advantages and shortcomings on 1d et 2d traction experiments and on the experiment by peltzer and tapponnier  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the proposed models with regularized fracture and define their evolution in time .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to showing that they satisfy a clausius - duhem type inequality . in section 4",
    ", we introduce a semi - discrete time evolution , which is the base , in the final section , for numerical experiments in the case of 1d , 2d traction and 2d plasticine experiment .",

    "a solution @xmath184 of problem ( [ problem2 ] ) is characterized by a system of one equality and two variational inequalities .",
    "such a system is not easy to solve numerically .",

    "this may introduce local minima , as the following example of a traction experiment of a 1d bar illustrates .",
    "assume that @xmath202 represent the displacement and phase - field marker of a 1d bar that lies in @xmath203 .",
    "we consider a simple model of evolution with only elasticity and fracture where the total energy writes @xmath204 where @xmath205 is a fixed young modulus and where the primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "the bar is crack - free at @xmath80 and thus @xmath206 .",
    "it is fixed at @xmath207 , while a uniform traction @xmath208 is applied at the other extremity .",
    "if @xmath209 is close to a constant at time @xmath210 , say @xmath211 , then the euler - lagrange optimality condition for minimization of the total energy with respect to @xmath0 amounts to solving @xmath212 the solution of which is @xmath213 with @xmath214 and @xmath215 these profiles are indeed what one obtains in the course of the numerical computations according to the algorithm described above , until @xmath210 reaches a sufficiently large value so that the term @xmath216 dominates @xmath217 in the energy , see figures  [ pv ] ,  [ deriveeu ] and [ ener ] ( we use the same parameters as in @xcite by bourdin ) .",
    "note that , due to the presence of the exponentials in the expression of @xmath0 , these profiles vary significantly near the extremities @xmath207 and @xmath218 of the beam , but are quite flat otherwise , and do not correspond to the picture of a generalized crack as that depicted in figure  [ rupture ] .",
    "further , the corresponding states @xmath219 are only local minima , as one can build states with lower total energy , as the examples below show .",
    "we note that choosing @xmath220 smaller does not improve the situation for that matter .",
    "this hurdle had been noticed earlier by bourdin  @xcite , @xcite , who suggested to complement the numerical algorithm with a supplementary step called backtracking , where after each iteration in time , one imposes a necessary condition derived from the definition  ( [ problem1 ] ) of the discrete - time evolution .",

    "we have reported numerical experiments that show that models 1 and 3 are most versatile : in particular we can observe evolutions where such materials become plastic and then crack    in a forthcoming work , we show that we can pass to the limit in model 1 as time step tends to 0 and give an existence result for a continuous evolution ( e1)-(e6 ) .",
