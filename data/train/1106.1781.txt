    "this paper is concerned with the initial - boundary value problem of the kawahara equation : @xmath2 with initial condition @xmath3 and the boundary condition @xmath4 it is well known that the one - dimensional waves of small but finite amplitude in dispersive systems ( e.g. , the magneto - acoustic waves in plasmas , the shallow water waves , the lattice waves and so on ) can be described by the korteweg - de vries ( kdv in short ) equation , given by @xmath5 which admits either compressive or rarefactive steady solitary wave solution ( by a solitary water wave , we mean a travelling wave solution of the water wave equations for which the free surface approaches a constant height as @xmath6 ) according to the sign of the dispersion term ( the third order derivative term ) . under certain circumstances , however , it might happen that the coefficient of the third order derivative in the kdv equation becomes small or even zero . in that case one",
    "has to take account of the higher order effect of dispersion in order to balance the nonlinear effect .",
    "in such cases one may obtain a generalized nonlinear dispersive equation , known as kawahara equation , which has a form of the kdv equation with an additional fifth order derivative term given by .",
    "the kawahara equation is an important nonlinear dispersive equation .",
    "it describes solitary wave propagation in media in which the first - order dispersion is anomalously small .",
    "a more specific physical background of this equation was introduced by hunter and scheurle @xcite , where they used it to describe the evolution of solitary waves in fluids in which the bond number is less than but close to @xmath7 and the froude number is close to @xmath8 . in the literature",
    "this equation is also referred to as the fifth order kdv equation or singularly perturbed kdv equation .",
    "the fifth order term @xmath9 is called the kawahara term .",
    "there has been a great deal of work on solitary wave solutions of the kawahara equation @xcite over the past thirty years .",
    "it is found that , similarly to the kdv equation , the kawahara equation also has solitary wave solutions which decay rapidly to zero as @xmath10 , but unlike the kdv equation whose solitary wave solutions are non - oscillating , the solitary wave solutions of the kawahara equation have oscillatory trails .",
    "this shows that the kawahara equation is not only similar but also different from the kdv equation in the properties of solutions , like what happens between the formulations of this equation and the kdv equation .",
    "the strong physical background of the kawahara equation and such similarities and differences between it and the kdv equation in both the form and the behavior of the solution render the mathematical treatment of this equation particularly interesting .",
    "the cauchy problem given by , has been studied by a few authors @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the problem , has a local solution @xmath11;h^r({\\mathbb{r}}))$ ] if @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this local result combined with the energy conservation law yields that has a global solution @xmath14;l^2({\\mathbb{r}}))$ ] if @xmath15 .",
    "well - posedness results can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the the derivation of convergent finite difference numerical methods for the initial - boundary value problem , , . the problem of analyzing convergent numerical schemes of course intimately connected with the mathematical properties of the cauchy problem for the kdv equation , which is well developed in literature .",
    "as far as we are concerned , the first mathematical proof of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the kdv equation was accomplished by sjberg @xcite in @xmath16 , using a finite difference semi - discrete approximation . in @xcite",
    ", authors have considered a fully - discrete finite difference scheme for the kdv equation and showed the convergence of their scheme . in this paper",
    ", we are going to use a similar technique here .",
    "note that sjberg s approach is based on a semi - discrete approximation where one discretizes the spatial variable , thereby reducing the equation to a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , we also stress that for numerical computaions this set of ordinary differential equations should be further discretized in order to be solved .",
    "thus in order to have a completely satisfactory numerical method , one seeks a fully discrete scheme that reduces the actual computation to a solution of a finite set of algebric equations . in the present paper",
    ", we consider both semi - discrete and fully - discrete cases to prove the following theorem :    [ theo : maintheorem ] if @xmath17 is a @xmath8-periodic function and fifth derivative of @xmath17 belongs to @xmath18 , then there exists a unique solution of the problem , and , i.e. , there exists a function @xmath19 with @xmath20 for which the euality holds as an @xmath21 equality .",
    "the numerical computaion of solutions of the kawahara equation is rather capricious .",
    "two competing equations are involved , namely nonlinear convective term @xmath22 , which in the context of the equation @xmath23 yields an infinite gradient in finite time even for smooth data , and the linear dispersive terms @xmath24 , which in the context of the equation @xmath25 produces hard to compute dispersive waves , and these two effects combined makes it difficult to obtain accurate and fast numerical methods .",
    "most of the finite difference schemes will consist of a sum of two terms , one discretizing the convective term and one discretizing the dispersive terms .",
    "these two effects will have to balance each other , as it is known that the kawahara equation itself keeps the sobolev norm @xmath26 bounded .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath27 , we consider the semi - discrete scheme for the initial - boundary value problem corresponding to . at first , we state some of the well - known sobolev type estimates and then we showed the convergence of the semi - discrete scheme . both local and global existence has been proved . in section @xmath0 , we consider a fully - discrete semi - implicit scheme for the initial - boundary value problem corresponding to .",
    "we have used explicit discretization for the `` nonlinear '' term and implicit discretizations for the `` dispersive '' terms .",
    "convergence of the fully - discrete scheme has been shown in this section . in section @xmath28 , we have shown the uniqueness of the solution to the initial - boundary value problem given by . finally , in section @xmath1",
    ", we have justified the convergence results by several numerical experiments , namely soliton experiments .",
    "we also compare our scheme , based on the fully - discrete semi - implicit scheme , with the existing results in literature .",
    "let @xmath29 be a small positive number and define a grid on the x - axis to be the set of gridpoints @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "we will denote the value of our difference approximation at @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "since we are in the periodic case , for simplicity we assume a unit period and that @xmath34 . in that case @xmath35 for @xmath31 . to simplify the notations",
    ", we will introduce the finite difference operators : @xmath36 we will also use the following notations : @xmath37 and in the space of gridfunctions ( a discrete , possibly complex valued , function defined on the grid ) , we define the scalar product and the norm by @xmath38 later we need the following lemmas , proven in @xcite .",
    "we begin with a well - known sobolev - type lemma :    [ lemma : lemma-1 ] let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be integers such that @xmath41 .",
    "then for every constant @xmath42 there exists a constant @xmath43 such that for all functions @xmath44 , sufficiently differentiable on @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47    [ lemma : lemma-2 ] let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be nonnegative integers with @xmath50 and @xmath51 be a function of the form @xmath52 then @xmath53    [ lemma : lemma-3 ] let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be integers such that @xmath41 , and @xmath54 be any gridfunction . then for every constant @xmath42 there exists a constant @xmath43 independent of @xmath55 and @xmath54 such that , @xmath56    [ remark-1 ] the inequality can be modified as follows : one can replace @xmath57 by any operator @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "the right - hand side can likewise be replaced by @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "however , it can be proven by counterexamples that the lemma is not true if the right member contains @xmath62 .",
    "[ remark-2 ] from the above lemmas the folloing result follows immediately @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath43 have the same properties as before .",

    "<S> we are concerned with the convergence of a numerical scheme for the initial - boundary value problem associated to the korteweg - de vries - kawahara equation ( in short kawahara equation ) , which is a transport equation perturbed by dispersive terms of @xmath0rd and @xmath1th order . </S>",
    "<S> this equation appears in several fluid dynamics problems . </S>",
    "<S> it describes the evolution of small but finite amplitude long waves in various problems in fluid dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we prove here the convergence of both semi - discrete as well as fully - discrete finite difference schemes for the kawahara equation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the convergence is illustratred by several examples . </S>"
