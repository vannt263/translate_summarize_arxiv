    "ever since acoustic peaks were detected in the cosmic microwave background @xcite and galaxy surveys @xcite , much effort has been devoted to use baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) as standard rulers to estimate cosmological distances with precision @xcite .",
    "bao signals are manifested as a wiggly feature in the matter power spectrum , and precise measurements could shed light on the dynamics of dark energy .",
    "the accuracy and precision of such measurement depends directly on the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum , which is straightforward to compute for a gaussian density field using wick s theorem .",
    "however , it is known that non - gaussianities are significant in that covariance matrix @xcite and may have an impact on cosmological distance measurements .",
    "a non - linear model is needed for a non - gaussian calculation , hence some criterion for the accuracy of such effects is needed to quantify the precision of the measurement . in particular , an optimal bao measurement should in general incorporate a proper error weighting of the data , which involves the inversion of the full covariance matrix .",
    "the accuracy criterion must therefore be based on the confidence we have on the inverted matrix .",
    "the estimator constructed in most forecasts and data analyses follow the prescription of @xcite , which is a procedure that constructs both the estimator of the bao scale and the estimator of its uncertainty under the gaussian assumption .",
    "the method was originally cross - checked with a @xmath2 analysis of @xmath3 simulations , including a jackknife sub - sampling of the n - body data , and showed good agreement .",
    "the actual deviation between this proposed estimator and the optimal estimator constructed in this paper is indeed small , therefore consistent with the work of @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we aim at improving on the accuracy of that method , and present a first significant detection of the effect of non - gaussian errors on the measurement of the bao scale ( the effect of non - linear evolution , in the form of erasure of the wiggle signal , has been well - studied of course @xcite ) .",
    "some data analyses @xcite also improved on the original method by constructing a non - gaussian estimator for the bao dilation scale uncertainty .",
    "this is typically done by modeling the non - linearities in the density fields with mock catalogs , which are produced from log - normal densities @xcite , @xmath4 order perturbation theory @xcite , halo models @xcite , etc .",
    "such techniques all attempt to increase the robustness of the analysis by taking into account the coupling between the fourier modes .",
    "as mentioned above , an optimal analysis must be based on a reliable inverted covariance matrix , and the accuracy of the inverse matrix constructed from mock catalogs is yet to be demonstrated .",
    "the covariance matrix in power spectrum is a four point function that relates pairs of wave numbers .",
    "the error on this covariance consists of pairs of these pairs , and is indeed difficult to quantify . without this metric",
    ", however , one does not know the significance of a non - gaussian computation .",
    "in addition , @xcite have found significant departures between the covariance matrix constructed from lagrangian perturbation theory and that obtained from their @xmath5 simulations . also unknown",
    "is the accuracy of log - normal densities at modeling the true covariance matrix and its inverse .",
    "other analyses @xcite treat the mode coupling as coming exclusively from the survey selection function , following the widely used fkp @xcite prescription .",
    "this specific coupling effect can be reduced with other choices of power spectrum estimators , like that presented in @xcite . in both cases , however , the non - linear mode coupling is not modeled .",
    "when it comes to the impact on the bao dilation scale , a gaussian treatment of the data yields a sub - optimal estimation of the mean , and the error bars obtained that way are systematically biased , usually on the low side . in the limit where the sample is large enough ,",
    "the value of the mean estimated in that fashion does converge to the `` true '' mean , but the estimated error bars never capture the correlation that occurs in the non - linear regime .",
    "many analyses attempt to correct for this bias with monte carlo simulations , however this effect is very small and takes a high accuracy and precision to observe .    in the non - gaussian case , however , an inversion of the covariance matrix is required , hence it can not be singular .",
    "consequently , the convergence of our measured matrix depends on the binning , and the inversion increases the noise even more .",
    "for an adequate resolution on all the scales relevant for bao analyses , the number of simulations required to obtain statistically significant conclusions can be large . in the past ,",
    "different groups used drastically different numbers of simulations : @xcite used 51 , @xcite used 400 , and @xcite used 5000 ; we use 1000 n - body simulations in this work . in order to invert a @xmath6 covariance matrix , one needs _ at least _ @xmath7 simulations to make the matrix non - singular .",
    "it is also generally thought that to achieve convergence on each element , we need of the order @xmath8 simulations .",
    "even then , the level of accuracy is not clear , and to make a significant claim about non - gaussian effects , one needs to know the uncertainty on the inverted matrix , which we measure from a bootstrap re - sampling , and to propagate the error onto the bao scale .    to address this convergence issue",
    ", we also apply a noise reduction technique before the inversion : we factorize the covariance matrix with an eigenvector decomposition , and keep only the principal component .",
    "this factorization is repeated at each of the bootstrap samplings , which allows us to draw robust conclusions on the convergence of our results .",
    "given the fact that the precision of the inverse covariance matrices used in analyses has never been demonstrated , the measurement of the mean and of the error on the mean found on the literature are most likely not optimal .",
    "measuring an optimal bao scale in actual data is complicated in many aspects , such as the fact that the universe is not periodic , and that surveys have selection functions .",
    "it would nevertheless involve a covariance weighted measurement , which is not included in the prescription given by @xcite .",
    "if one could improve the measurement of the power spectrum covariance , however i.e. from n - body simulations , it would be possible to measure a more robust and more accurate _",
    "uncertainty _ on the sub - optimal mean , compared to the original claim .",
    "the difference in performance between these two bao dilation scale estimator is still an unmeasured quantity . in this paper , we first attempt to address this question by comparing three different analysis scenarios :    1 .",
    "the first case we consider is an attempt at measuring a correct error bar on a sub - optimal mean of the bao dilation scale .",
    "even if we know that the universe is non - gaussian , it is still possible to treat it as gaussian , i.e. not use an optimally weighted sum when estimating the mean , even though the power spectrum itself is non - linear . doing so , we must keep in mind that the measurements are non - optimal , and that the naive gaussian error bars are most likely too small compared to the  true \" error .",
    "however , given the fact that we can measure a full covariance matrix from n - body simulations , we can get a better estimate of the error bars on that sub - optimal mean by treating the original covariance matrix as noisy and by performing an appropriate inverse covariance weighting . from now on , we refer to this case as the `` sub - optimal '' estimator of the bao error .",
    "this approach is commonly used to obtain `` monte - carlo '' error bars , and exactly what is measured by the forecasting prescriptions mentioned above .",
    "we call this approach `` sub - optimal '' because the errors bars could still be further reduced by improving the estimator of the mean bao scale using the non - gaussian model .",
    "it provides a quick estimate of the magnitude of non - gaussianity , and a simple way of scaling errors bars obtained from gaussian analysis , which is often used in surveys .",
    "the second case , dubbed `` optimal estimator '' , is the best quadratic analysis one can possibly do  knowing that the universe is non - gaussian , we treat it as is , measuring a fully non - linear power spectrum covariance matrix and performing an optimally weighted sum to estimate both the means and the uncertainties on the parameters .",
    "given the fact that we rely on a large number of n - body simulations , that our volume is periodic , and that we have a high signal to noise , then both our estimators are truly optimal in the least squares sense . is six - dimensional , and non - isotropic in the sense that pairs of mode separated by smaller angles are more correlated .",
    "on top of that , the observed quantity is convoluted in six - dimensional with pairs of survey selection function @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "we find solutions that apply to periodic volumes , and we leave it for future work the extraction of optimal estimator in more complex data . ]",
    "3 .   many times in the literature @xcite ,",
    "the above case is modified by replacing the non - linear covariance matrix by a gaussian one .",
    "this effectively treats the power spectrum measurements as gaussian , even though the data are correlated . under the widely used fkp @xcite approximation , for example",
    ", the only source of mode coupling comes from the convolution with the survey selection function ; it thus considers the underlying covariance matrix to be diagonal . for reasons mentioned above",
    ", the error bars obtained this way could be systematically underestimated .",
    "we did not address the question of shot noise , however , which is also non - gaussian in nature . in the case of surveys that address some of the non - gaussianities with mock catalogs ,",
    "the error correct bars should lie somewhere between case ( i ) and case ( ii ) ( while some approach case ( iii ) ) , depending on how close to optimal the measured power spectrum is , and how well the catalogs model the non - linear dynamics .",
    "@xcite showed that the difference in estimator between cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) is very small ( i.e. , with optimal weighting , errors near the pure - gaussian errors are achieved ) , but this is not the complete story , especially when dealing with current gaussian or sub - optimal data analyses .",
    "the question we address is the following  by how much does the error bars on the _ least robust _ bao dilation scale ( case ( iii ) ) differ from a correct calculation based on an optimal covariance matrix and properly inverse covariance weighted ( case ( i ) ) ?    finally , we go one step further and repeat the measurements of non - gaussian effects on reconstructed density fields .",
    "we apply a density reconstruction algorithm @xcite that was developed to improve the bao signal at late times , which is partially lost due to non - linear coupling between fourier modes @xcite .",
    "other approaches have been explored to recover some of the fisher information lost in gravitational collapse @xcite , but it was not verified how these methods propagate to constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the full bao analysis is indeed sensitive to this intermediate stage , but in a non - gaussian treatment , the interplay between the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix and the derivatives is quite subtle .",
    "we thus set forth to test quantitatively how this reconstruction algorithm affects the bao dilation error , for the three analysis cases mentioned above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : background ]",
    "we briefly review how bao dilation measurements can constrain dark energy . in section [ sec : nbodysimulations ] we describe our set of n - body simulations and the reconstruction algorithm . in section [ sec : powerspectrumanalysis ] we discuss how to extract both the gaussian and the non - gaussian covariance matrices . in section [ sec : eigen ] we describe the eigenvector decomposition , while in section [ sec : parameterestimation ] we present the fisher matrix formalism and the estimators of the bao dilation uncertainty for the three analysis cases .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : resultsanddiscussion ] we present and discuss our results .",
    "the matter clustering we observe today is the result of tiny inhomogeneities set during inflation in the early universe @xcite . over time , matter collapsed gravitationally into over - dense regions that eventually evolved into large scale structures .",
    "as long as the perturbations are small , the structure growth equations can be linearized .",
    "we can therefore understand the evolution of inhomogeneities by considering perturbations one at a time .    in the early universe , matter and photons",
    "are coupled together as a single fluid via thomson scattering . due to radiation pressure , photons begin to disperse away from over - dense regions , pushing the baryons alongside .",
    "dark matter , on the other hand , only interacts weakly with that fluid , via gravity , and does not respond efficiently to the photons push .",
    "the perturbation eventually grows into a state where the initial clump of dark matter gets surrounded by a spherical ripple of baryon - photon fluid , which expands at the speed of sound @xmath9 .    at about @xmath10 ,",
    "when photons decouple from matter , they no longer push the baryons . the speed of sound in the fluid drops abruptly , and the bao ripple stops moving and freezes out .",
    "eventually , dark matter also responds gravitationally to this over - dense region of baryons .",
    "the result of this initial point - perturbation is a smooth clump of matter with a spherical shell of density enhancement at the _ sound horizon _ , about 150 mpc away from the center .",
    "the complete final field is , by huygens s principle , the superposition of similar spherical ripples of density enhancement from the initial perturbations at all points .",
    "therefore , we do not observe these spherical ripples directly , but measure them statistically in the mass auto - correlation function .",
    "using galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey as tracers of the matter distribution , an excess correlation at 150 mpc apart has been observed @xcite .",
    "although the bao in the correlation function is intuitive , we are interested in the bao power spectrum @xmath11 which is related to @xmath12 by a transformation @xmath13 the correlation peak in real space is manifested as a series of wiggles in fourier space .",
    "this oscillatory feature is even more robust against observational contaminations @xcite .      the accelerating expansion of the universe is widely blamed on dark energy , a mysterious entity which contributes to more than 70% of the energy content in the universe .",
    "dark energy can be described by an equation of state @xmath14 relating its pressure @xmath15 and density @xmath16 .",
    "a common parameterization of @xmath17 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the value in the present day .",
    "the friedmann equation now reads @xmath20 \\end{array } \\label{eqn : friedmann}\\ ] ] where the terms on the right hand side are the energy contributions of matter , radiation , curvature , and dark energy respectively . for an object of a fixed co - moving size @xmath21 , its projections across and along the line of sight",
    "are given by @xmath22 @xmath23 respectively .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the redshift span and angular size of the object on the sky , and @xmath26 is the angular diameter distance to its center .",
    "if this object has a fixed co - moving size , it then acts as a standard ruler , where measurements of @xmath24 and @xmath25 give estimates for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "this , in turn , provides constraints for @xmath29 via equation [ eqn : friedmann ] , given an adequate redshift sampling .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to an idealized isotropic universe with no observational distortions , such that the standard ruler is given by the sound horizon , which has size @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the fractional errors on these quantities can be used to constrain @xmath31 and @xmath32 . to estimate the error on @xmath21",
    ", we construct a fisher matrix that propagates the correlated uncertainty measured in our simulated power spectra .",
    "we run a total of 1000 simulations using a particle - particle - particle - mesh ( p@xmath33 m ) n - body code cubep3 m , the successor to pmfast @xcite .",
    "each simulation has @xmath34 dark matter particles in a periodic cube of @xmath35mpc on one side .",
    "the initial condition of each simulation at @xmath36 is produced by a gaussian random field , which is characterized by an initial transfer function generated by camb .",
    "for this work we use the following cosmological parameters : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we output the particle positions and velocities at redshifts 0.5 , 1.0 and 2.0 , and then the particles are assigned to a density field @xmath43 on a @xmath44 grid using the cloud - in - cell algorithm @xcite .    to understand the density reconstruction algorithm , it is helpful to look at the process by which initial conditions are generated in a typical n - body simulation .",
    "a gaussian random field @xmath45 in fourier space can be constructed by generating a field of gaussian random numbers whose variance is determined by an input power spectrum . under the zeldovich approximation @xcite , we then compute a displacement field @xmath46 which , when fourier transformed back into real space , can be applied to displace a uniformly distributed set of particles .",
    "in addition , the density field allows us to calculate the gravitational potential , whose gradient gives the particles initial velocities .",
    "we solve for these initial conditions at @xmath36 , where our simulations begin .",
    "the reconstruction algorithm developed by @xcite essentially uses the @xmath43 output to calculate a displacement field , and subtracts the displacements from the particle positions .",
    "this is indeed very similar to the procedure that generates initial conditions described previously , except that the displacements are subtracted from the particles positions , instead of added .",
    "the algorithm is the following , as was neatly summarized by @xcite .    1 .",
    "calculate the density field @xmath43 using particle positions , and then transform it into fourier space @xmath45 .",

    "subtract that quantity from the original matrix , and extract the principal eigenvector of the result .",
    "we repeat this process until the difference between the original and the model converges  four times in this case . at the end of the iterative step @xmath73 , the parameterized matrix is thus given by @xmath102^{2}\\right)+              \\lambda^{i } u_{\\lambda}^{i}(k ) u_{\\lambda}^{i}(k ' )      \\label{eqn : eigen_init}\\ ] ] after the last iteration , we update the first term with the latest @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the diagonal component typically starts off as unity in the largest scales and fades away in the non - linear regime . in this case ,",
    "the strongest eigenvalue is almost two orders of magnitude larger than all others , hence we keep only a single eigenvector ( see @xcite for the application of this method when the angular dependence of the covariance matrix is preserved ) .",
    "the modeled covariance matrix is then recovered from this noise - reduced cross - correlation matrix with the diagonal elements of the original covariance @xmath103 ( not to be confused with the diagonal component of the factorization of @xmath104 ) following equation [ eqn : corrmatrix ] .",
    "although we do need @xmath105 matrix elements to start with , the power of this decomposition relies on the fact that the prior is accurate at the few percent level , and that everything that does not fit into this form is considered as noise .",
    "we thus recover smooth and accurate covariance matrices , even though the input elements are noisy .",
    "the explanation for this is that one needs only to measure the n diagonal elements of the covariance matrix ( which are generally the easiest to resolve ) plus one eigenvector ( which combines the data of a large portion of the matrix into another n elements ) .",
    "we present the fractional error between the modeled and the original matrices in figure [ fig : frac_error ] , and observe that individual elements match the model at the ten percent level at @xmath106 .",
    "this improves to the few percent level for even smaller scales .",
    "we expect these higher @xmath63 modes to be more accurately measured to start with , since they come from the angle averaging of @xmath63-shells that contain much larger number of cells .    .",
    "as expected , the lower @xmath63 modes are more noisy due to lower statistics .",
    "we still achieve an agreement of about ten percent at @xmath107 , and even better for smaller scales .",
    ", width=336 ]        we then present in figure [ fig : ratio_to_gauss ] the diagonals of the original covariance matrix and of both components , divided by the gaussian prediction .",
    "the sum of the two components is equal to the original matrix on the diagonal by construction .",
    "the off - diagonal components of the factorization can be tested against the original by comparing the cumulative fisher informations ( equation [ eqn : info ] ) .",
    "we observe that the information from the factorized covariance matrices exhibit the same essential features , namely a gaussian increase up to about @xmath108 , followed by a saturation plateau .",
    "we present the ratio of this modeled information to the original distribution in figure [ fig : info_ratio_model ] and observe that the factorization reproduces the information content at the few percent level . although the figures presented in this section correspond to the unreconstructed densities at @xmath56 , we achieve comparable performances on reconstructed density fields at all measured redshifts .    .",
    "the departure from the original is at most @xmath109 , and the agreement is otherwise at the few percent level.,width=336 ]    this factorization has one extra advantage , which comes from the fact that @xmath110 is binning independent .",
    "the original covariance matrix is binning dependent , since the number of modes entering each element varies as we change from linear to logarithmic bands , for example .",
    "this is correct , but it has a major inconvenience ",
    "the cross - correlation coefficient matrix ( equation [ eqn : covariance ] ) visually changes significantly .",
    "it becomes a tedious task to compare figures from different authors .",
    "we can therefore attempt to fix this problem by constructing binning independent quantities .",
    "the diagonal component , @xmath111 , is close to gaussian , as seen in figure [ fig : ratio_to_gauss ] , hence it is roughly inversely proportional to the number of modes in the bin .",
    "we scale it with the ratio between the measured number of modes and the continuous limit case : @xmath112 , and obtain a binning independent quantity .",
    "we have also shown in this section that the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are well modeled by @xmath113 , which are binning independent as well .",
    "the solution is thus to replace the diagonal of the original covariance matrix such that @xmath114 \\frac{n}{n_{cont } } +   \\lambda u^{2}(k).\\ ] ] this bin independent result is made available thanks to the factorization presented above , which allows us to isolate the bin dependence ( that comes exclusively from the diagonal component ) and to apply our correction .",
    "the cross - correlation coefficient matrix calculated that way is shown in figure [ fig : corrmatrix ] , and compares well with @xcite , apart from the anti - correlation between the largest and the smallest modes ( see section [ subsec : covmatrix ] , and note that it is not clear that the simulations @xcite were large enough to contradict our anti - correlation result ) .",
    "for a set of parameters @xmath115 , the fisher matrix @xmath116 is given by the inverse of a covariance matrix @xmath117 where @xmath118 or @xmath119 , as described in the previous sections . since our @xmath120",

    ", since we are interested in estimating the fractional errors of @xmath21 ( 1d ) or @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( 2d ) , we set @xmath128 in 1d , and @xmath129 and @xmath130 in 2d .",
    "the derivatives in equation [ eqn : fisher ] can be evaluated in a number of ways .",
    "we can either produce a variety of @xmath11 using different parameters @xmath21 and take their finite differences , or we can parametrize @xmath11 as a function of @xmath21 , and evaluate the derivatives analytically . in both cases ,",

    "the finite differencing of @xmath11 is done by producing many @xmath11 using cmbfast , and dividing their differences by the differences of @xmath21 being used . on the other hand",
    ", readers familiar with @xcite would recall that they suggested an analytical form of the wiggles using a damped sync function , and they approximated the square of the sinusoidal components in the fisher matrix as a constant . in our work , since we use non - gaussian ( hence non - diagonal ) covariance matrices , we do not adapt that constant approximation , as the detailed structure of the signal becomes important once off - diagonal errors are present .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to show what effect this approximation and the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix can have on our results .",
    "see appendix a for this discussion .      in a data analysis ,",
    "non - linear covariance matrices are usually hard to measure with a high signal to noise , especially in surveys that exhibit complex selection functions .",
    "what is often done in that case is to assume gaussianity in the data , while ignoring the fact that the band powers themselves are actually non - gaussian .",
    "the values extracted for the mean and the error on the bao dilation scale are not properly weighted , since they assume that all errors in @xmath136bands are uncorrelated . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the resulting mean is sub - optimal , while the error bars are most likely off by an unknown amount . since we now have measured a non - linear covariance matrix @xmath137 , we are in a position to compare the correct error bars for existing data analysis ( case ( i ) ) with those quoted in literature , which approach case ( iii ) at various levels .",
    "we recall that the difference between sub - optimal and optimal is somewhat reduced for analyses that model the non - linearities in the fields .",
    "we derive a `` sub - optimal '' estimator by solving the linear system @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a vector containing a set of cosmological parameters of interest ( here we consider only @xmath140 , hence @xmath139 is a scalar , but this method could be generalized to include @xmath141 and @xmath142 for instance ) , and @xmath143 is a noisy observable , associated with a noisy covariance matrix @xmath144 . in our case ,",

    "we obtain the following estimator for the error in @xmath149 : @xmath150 where @xmath151 , and @xmath152 is a vector - matrix - vector product similar to equation [ eqn : fisher ] , and where @xmath153 is the improved estimate of the non - linear covariance matrix , which we obtained from our simulations . notice that if the true covariance matrix was indeed gaussian ( i.e. @xmath154 ) , we would recover the optimal estimator where @xmath155 .",
    "in other words , cases ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) would be identical .",
    "conversely , if the original matrix was already the optimal measurement ( i.e. @xmath156 ) , we would get @xmath157 , i.e. cases ( i ) and case ( ii ) would be the same , possibly different from case ( iii ) .",
    "we also note that the _ inverse _ of the true covariance matrix is not involved in equation [ eqn : gaussianestimator ] .    in the next sections ,",
    "we consider the case where gaussianity was originally assumed in a bao analysis , we correctly estimate the error of @xmath139 ( with this sub - optimal estimator ) and compare the results produced with an optimal estimator .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : xi ] , density reconstruction sharpens the acoustic peak in the correlation function .",
    "this is equivalent to reducing the non - linear damping of the wiggles in the power spectrum .",
    "we parametrize the reduction of damping due to reconstruction by an extra factor in front of @xmath158 in the damping factor @xcite such that    @xmath159 \\rightarrow                    \\exp\\left [ - \\frac { ( 1-f)^2 k^2 \\sigma_{nl}^2}{2 } \\right ]      \\label{eqn : reconfac}\\ ] ]    where @xmath160 represents 100% reconstruction , canceling any non - linear effects . in reality , such a case is unachievable , as some information has been irreversibly lost . in principle",
    ", we could measure @xmath161 by extracting the power spectrum wiggles before and after reconstruction , and find the best fit damping factor .",
    "looking at figure [ fig : xi ] , we see that the reconstructed correlation at @xmath56 is very similar to the correlation at @xmath162 .",
    "the ratio of growth factors between these two redshifts is 0.55 , and the reconstructed field actually looks slightly better than the @xmath162 field , so we adopt the standard @xmath163 , which reduces non - linear damping by 50% @xcite .",
    "we set up hypothetical surveys with volume @xmath164 centered on redshifts @xmath56 and @xmath165 .",

    "this is done by picking 1000 random simulations ( allowing repeats ) from our set , and taking the standard deviations of the results using 2000 such random sets .",
    "the noise reduction technique is performed for every set .",
    "the only redshift dependence in the estimator comes from the non - linear damping scale @xmath169 ( equation [ eqn : reconfac ] ) .",
    "in addition , we know from figures [ fig : corrmatrix ] and [ fig : information ] that the covariance matrices in the linear regime are similar to the gaussian covariance matrix . therefore , we expect errors at small @xmath63 to be hardly distinguishable among estimators and redshifts . at large @xmath63 , however , we expect the effects of the covariance matrices and the derivatives to have a more pronounced effect on the estimator .",
    "the redshift dependent damping scale @xmath169 becomes important and distinguishes between @xmath56 and @xmath165 .",
    "the top panels of figures [ fig : ds_kmax ] and [ fig : ds_kmax_recon ] show the measured distance errors vs limiting @xmath167 , with and without reconstruction , respectively .",

    "moreover , we do not expect modes of @xmath85 mpc@xmath86 to carry any bao information , as the wiggles on small scales suffer from silk damping @xcite as well as non - linear damping ( section [ sec : effectsofreconstruction ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ds_kmax_recon ] shows the distance errors with @xmath163 and covariance matrices from reconstructed simulations .",
    "since some of the wiggles are indeed recovered , the optimal distance errors decreased by 50% to 70% compared to the case with no reconstruction ( figure [ fig : ds_kmax ] ) . more importantly ,",
    "though , the discrepancy between sub - optimal and optimal estimates becomes slightly more severe . in the presence of reconstruction , a naive gaussian assumption can underestimate the variance of the errors by up to 20% near the trans - linear scales ( @xmath171 mpc@xmath86 ) .",
    "somewhat disturbingly , at small scales @xmath85 mpc@xmath86 the sub - optimal estimate deviate significantly from the optimal estimate .",
    "a sub - optimal estimator certainly is not expected to provide the same result as an optimal estimator . and also , as mentioned above , the regime @xmath85 mpc@xmath86 is irrelevant to bao analysis",
    ". therefore , we did not investigate this behavior further .",
    "our results from figure [ fig : ds_kmax ] show that the three treatments of the errors have similar constraining power on the bao dilation scale .",

    "we found that the variances of those measurements can differ by up to 15% , compared to our optimal estimator .",

    "we note in passing that these results were entirely obtained from n - body simulations , hence the effect of the survey selection function has been factored out of our problem . constructing optimal estimators with actual data",
    "will however be more challenging , since it has to include such an effect , which effectively couple fourier modes from different bins , in addition to account for the effect of bias between the sampled tracers ( i.e. galaxies or 21 cm structure ) and the underlying matter density .",
    "we have also implemented a density reconstruction algorithm , which recovers some of the lost bao information due to non - linear gravitational collapse at late times . in that case , the error on the dilation scale is reduced by a factor of about 70% at low redshift , but the discrepancy between the sub - optimal and optimal estimates remains similar to the case without reconstruction ( 20% and 15% , with and without reconstruction ) .",
    "we mention in conclusion that in a survey , the increase in variance we observed when using a sub - optimal estimator is equivalent to losing about the same percentage of survey volume , because the variance of measurements is inversely proportional to volume .",

    "interestingly even though the fisher information ( figure [ fig : information ] ) of gaussian and non - gaussian covariance matrices differ by about an order of magnitude near @xmath176 mpc@xmath86 , the measurement errors ( figures [ fig : ds_kmax ] and [ fig : ds_kmax_recon ] ) differ by only a few percent .",
    "the reason for this is that when the oscillatory power spectrum derivative @xmath177 is multiplied into the covariance matrix to compute the fisher matrix ( equation [ eqn : fisher ] ) , the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix can be canceled out .    in @xcite , they considered the regime @xmath178 mpc@xmath86 and approximated a @xmath179 term , which originates from @xmath177 , as simply @xmath180 without any oscillations when computing their fisher matrix .",
    "since we are considering a similar regime , we also attempted this approximation .",
    "we emphasize that this approximation is not applicable to us , as our non - gaussian covariance matrix is not diagonal .",
    "nevertheless , it illustrates the effect that an oscillatory @xmath177 can have on distance measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : ds_approx ] shows @xmath181 as a function of limiting @xmath167 , using the approximated derivative .",
    "this can be compared to the top panel in figure [ fig : ds_kmax ] , where the only difference is that figure [ fig : ds_approx ] uses the approximated @xmath177 , and figure [ fig : ds_kmax ] computes @xmath177 by finite differences of actual power spectra . in both figures ,",
    "the optimal estimators follow the inverse of the fisher information ( equation [ eqn : info ] ) . for the optimal gaussian case ,",
    "the errors using either forms of derivatives give similar results ( other than some oscillations at small @xmath63 ) .",
    "this is expected since the gaussian covariance matrix is diagonal ( equation [ eqn : covariancegauss ] ) , so the approximation is valid . for the sub - optimal cases we considered in this paper ,",
    "however , the discrepancies from the optimal gaussian case reach factors of 2 to 3 , depending on redshift .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that all elements of the covariance matrix are given a uniform weight . when using the finite difference derivatives , however , different elements are weighted according to the values of @xmath177 at their corresponding @xmath63 modes .",
    "this effectively cancels most of the contributions from the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix , which explains why the optimal and sub - optimal errors differ by only a few percent in that case .",
    "( without reconstruction ) .",
    "the only difference here is that the power spectrum derivative in the fisher matrix is an approximation which does not oscillate .",

    "<S> we revisit the uncertainty in baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) forecasts and data analyses . in particular , we study how much the uncertainties on both the measured mean dilation scale and the associated error bar are affected by the non - gaussianity of the non - linear density field . </S>",
    "<S> we examine two possible impacts of non - gaussian analysis : ( 1 ) we derive the distance estimators from gaussian theory , but use 1000 n - body simulations to measure the actual errors , and compare this to the gaussian prediction , and ( 2 ) we compute new optimal estimators , which requires the inverse of the non - gaussian covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum . obtaining an accurate and precise inversion is challenging , and we opted for a noise reduction technique applied on the covariance matrices . by measuring the bootstrap error on the inverted matrix </S>",
    "<S> , this work quantifies for the first time the significance of the non - gaussian error corrections on the bao dilation scale . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the variance ( error squared ) on distance measurements can deviate by up to 12% between both estimators , an effect that requires a large number of simulations to be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> we next apply a reconstruction algorithm to recover some of the bao signal that had been smeared by non - linear evolution , and we rerun the analysis . we find that after reconstruction , the rms error on the distance measurement improves by a factor of @xmath0 at low redshift ( consistent with previous results ) , and the variance ( @xmath1 ) shows a change of up to 18% between optimal and sub - optimal cases ( note , however , that these discrepancies may depend in detail on the procedure used to isolate the bao signal ) . </S>",
