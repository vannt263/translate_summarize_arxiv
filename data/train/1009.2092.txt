    "therefore , we suggest that the shift observed here can be ascribed to the presence of defects in the ttf - tcnq thin films .    to estimate the defect concentration from the peierls transition temperature shift we use the microscopic calculation approach introduced in @xcite .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the preferential growth directions of ttf - tcnq thin films for various substrate materials and crystallographic orientations .",
    "the morphology of the thin films was studied for different film thicknesses .",
    "it was shown that for some critical thickness the morphology of the ttf - tcnq films changes from two - dimensional into a three - dimensional structure only for grown on nacl(100 ) and mgf@xmath9(001 ) .",
    "the peierls transition temperature was analyzed for ttf - tcnq thin films of varies thicknesses , grown on different substrate materials and orientations .",
    "we demonstrated that the influence of most substrate materials on the peierls transition temperature is negligible and no clamping between thin film and substrate takes place .",
    "contrary , if the interaction between the ttf - tcnq thin film and the substrate is strong , as is the case for growth on nacl(100 ) substrates , the peierls transition temperature depends on the thin film thickness .",
    "the interaction between thin film and substrate causes the occurrence of microstrain in thin films .",
    "we furthermore demonstrated that the peierls transition temperature of ttf - tcnq thin films is shifted towards lower values , as compared to the ttf - tcnq single crystals .",
    "the defects which emerge in ttf - tcnq microcrystals due to the non - equilibrium growth process may destroy the long range order and be partly responsible for this temperature shift . using a theoretical framework developed in @xcite we estimated the concentration of defects as @xmath230.14% .",
    "this paper point towards some open questions .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to investigate the behavior of the peierls transition in the ttf - tcnq microcrystals and nanowires @xcite , where the substrate can induce a stronger influence on the microcrystal , as compared to thin films , leading to uni- and biaxial strains in the system , as was done for @xmath57-(bedt - ttf)@xmath9cu@xmath58n(cn@xmath59$]br in @xcite .",
    "such a study would have to be complemented by a theoretical analysis of the dependence of the peierls transition temperature on uni- and bi - axial strain .",

    "they also thank roland sachser and anastasia cmyrev for their support in doing the conductivity and sem measurements , oleksandr foyevtsov for his assistance in performing line profile analysis and dr .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate the influence of the substrate material and film thickness on the peierls transition temperature in tetrathiafulvalene - tetracyanoquinodimethane ( ttf - tcnq ) thin films , grown by physical vapor deposition . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the substrate material and the growth conditions strongly influence the film morphology . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we demonstrate that the peierls transition temperature in thin films is lower than in ttf - tcnq single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this effect arises due to defects , which emerge in ttf - tcnq thin films during the growth process . </S>"
