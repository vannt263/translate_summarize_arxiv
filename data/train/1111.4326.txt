    "these waves can be easily separated in the time - of - flight experiment ; the signal @xmath1 , which comes with the sound delay , will be referred to below as `` sound potential '' , and the signal @xmath2 propagating with the fermi velocity will be called `` electron sound potential ''",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the potential as well as the elastic displacement are measured at the metal boundary , where partial conversion between different types of the oscillations always occurs .",
    "therefore the recorded signal is generally the result of interference between different processes , and its magnitude may differ from its bulk value in the propagating wave .",
    "indeed , an analysis of the electric signals of the first type , assuming specular reflection of electrons from the sample surface , showed@xcite that the potential @xmath3 is formed by two contributions : @xmath4 , which has the sound spatial period , and @xmath5 , generated by the fast quasiwave excited at the receiving interface .",
    "diffuseness of the sample boundary numerically modifies the effect , but the main features remain qualitatively unchanged.@xcite    elastic deformations coupled to the electron sound have been studied in refs .   and .",
    "in the present paper , we pay our main attention to the electron sound potential @xmath2 .",
    "this study is of interest due to the following reasons .",
    "first , it provides additional arguments in favor of earlier assumptions@xcite of fermi - liquid nature of the electron sound , enabling us to separate the zero - sound mode from the quasiwave .",

    "such a behavior of @xmath3 and @xmath2 has no explanation within the existing knowledge about the penetration of the longitudinal electric field in superconductors.@xcite it can be thought that the mysterious behavior of the electric field generated by an inhomogeneous elastic deformation in a superconductor is a common property of the superconducting phase irrespective of investigated materials .",

    "the elastic component of the signal at the opposite face of the sample was registered by a piezoelectric transducer , and the electric potential was measured by an electrode attached to the sample within the region of the `` sound spot '' .",
    "the electrode has been made from the sound - absorbing material ( brass ) to prevent appearance of its own potential .",
    "in contrast to ref .  , where we used a point contact , the electrode diameter was @xmath7 mm , which provides more controlled mechanical boundary conditions .",
    "the electrode can be glued to the sample surface by the acoustic grease or slightly appressed to the sample by a spring .",
    "obviously , the first case is more similar to a matched boundary , while the second case to a free one .",
    "the experiment was performed in the time - of - flight regime : the duration of the excitation signal has been chosen smaller than the sound delay in the sample , which excludes the possibility of the acoustic resonance .",

    "this means that @xmath157 can not decrease below @xmath158 faster than the sound attenuation decrement @xmath159 ( for the case of a specular interface , a detailed analysis was given in ref .  ) .",
    "moreover , since the sound attenuation in our sample is rather large , @xmath160 , the dependence @xmath161 must pass through a maximum due to rapid increase of the damping factor @xmath162 $ ] near @xmath0 .",
    "the relationship similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , following from the elasticity equation , occurs in any model , therefore the conclusion about the temperature dependence of @xmath157 seems to be always true .    however , as it has been already reported,@xcite the experimental value of @xmath3 decreases considerably faster than expected on the basis of these considerations .",
    "we note that the measurement of the potential in these experiments was carried out by a point contact , for which the mechanical boundary conditions depend on its pressing , i.e. , on a badly controlled parameter .",
    "in particular , it can be thought that the situation with a point contact is close to the case of free boundary , and , correspondingly , the contribution of @xmath4 in the potential measured in ref .",
    "is completely absent . in the present experiments ,",
    "@xmath4 is unambiguously a part of @xmath3 ; nevertheless , the result of measurements of @xmath13 in the superconducting state shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] completely reproduces the previous result .",
    "= 8.5 cm    [ fig4 ]    at large excitation intensity , @xmath163 exhibits a maximum , which is due to local overheating of the receiving interface and vanishes with the decrease of @xmath164 . in the absence of the overheating",
    ", the quantity @xmath165 obeys the law close to linear in @xmath166 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , inset ) with a large prefactor similar to that in the imaginary part of the transversal conductivity of a superconductor , @xmath167 , which describes screening of the electromagnetic field of the sound wave by supercurrents .",
    "this enables one to suspect that the oscillating currents , spreading over the sample surface from the sound spot , take part in formation of @xmath13 .",
    "these currents were indeed observed in the experiments;@xcite however , they disappear at @xmath168 as quickly as the potential does and therefore hardly can be a primary cause of its decrease .",
    "= 8.5 cm    [ fig5 ]    generally , the theoretical analysis of @xmath13 and the interpretation of its experimental behavior represent a rather complicated problem , because both @xmath157 and @xmath5 contribute to the sound potential . in principle , these terms may compensate each other , although such a situation seems to be hardly probable .",
    "moreover , as was noted above , the potential @xmath157 is the result of practically complete ( @xmath121 ) cancellation of large electric and deformation contributions ; for this reason , the ordinary accuracy of estimations ( also @xmath121 ) must be substantially increased . in this sense ,",
    "the measurement of @xmath2 is more preferable , because this potential has a purely electric nature .",
    "the results of measurements of @xmath169 and @xmath170 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] show that the potential of the electron sound disappears at @xmath168 practically in a jumplike way , similar to @xmath3 .",
    "strangely , but the result of measuring @xmath3 and @xmath2 looks as an evidence of impossibility of the existence of the potential gradient in a superconductor .",
    "of course , we do not adhere to such a point of view , because it fully contradicts the universally recognized theories and well - established experimental facts ( see , e.g. , a review@xcite ) , but the problem of interpretation of these paradoxical data still exists .",
    "the nature of the signal @xmath170 also remains unclear .",
    "taking into account the analysis of the three - band model , it could be thought that a small jump in @xmath170 near @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) can be interpreted as the suppression of the quasiwave just below @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it was shown experimentally@xcite that the change of both the amplitude and the phase of @xmath170 below @xmath0 has nothing to do with the change of attenuation and velocity of the electron sound and relates only to the behavior of the coefficient of coupling between the electron sound and the exciting elastic deformation .",
    "this contradicts the theoretical predictions@xcite about the behavior of the quasiwave amplitude and phase in the superconductor . besides",
    ", we would remind the conclusion of ref .",
    "that in presence of the interband cooper pairing , the zero sound spectrum in the superconducting phase has an activating character with a gap close to the energy gap of the superconductor .",
    "thus , the propagation of the zero sound at our frequencies is forbidden in the superconducting state .",
    "but if the signal @xmath170 below @xmath0 is neither zero sound nor the quasiwave , then what is it ?",
    "no clear answer on this question exists yet .",
    "we have measured the temperature dependencies of the amplitude and the phase of the potential @xmath2 and the elastic displacement @xmath8 accompanying a fast electron sound wave excited by the longitudinal ultrasound in a single crystal of high - purity ga .",
    "simultaneously , the amplitude and the phase of the potential @xmath3 and the elastic displacement @xmath9 in the excited acoustic wave have been studied .",
    "we found that in the normal state , the behavior of the phases of @xmath2 and @xmath8 differs qualitatively : while the phase of @xmath2 increases with temperature , the phase of @xmath8 decreases . by using the wiener - hopf method",
    ", we examined several theoretical models that describe excitation and propagation of different types of the electron sound in samples of finite size with the diffusive exciting interface .",
    "the model of free electrons , in which only the quasiwave is responsible for the electron sound transport , enabled us to explain several important experimental facts : giant enhancement ( by the factor @xmath128 ) of elastic displacements induced by the electron sound wave at the sample boundary , insensitivity of @xmath2 on the boundary conditions at the receiving interface , the temperature behavior of @xmath3 and its closeness to @xmath2 in the magnitude .",
    "however , neither this model nor the model of a compensated metal with two sheets of the fermi surface ( in which zero - sound or concentration modes occur in presence of the fermi - liquid interaction ) are able to explain the difference between the phases of @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "we obtained a qualitative interpretation of this experimental result within a model with three equal fermi spheres , which reflects the presence of three main sheets of the fermi surface in ga.@xcite for reasonable values of the fermi - liquid interaction coefficients , the elastic signal @xmath8 was found to be formed by the zero sound , while the potential @xmath2 is basically associated with the quasiwave , which results in opposite changes of their phases with temperature .",
    "of course , this simple model can not pretend to be a quantitative description of the real situation .",
    "nevertheless , our estimations indicate a possibility , in principle , for the `` potentialless '' propagation of the zero sound ( or the concentration wave ) on a background of the potential created by the ballistic transport and enable us to suppose actual realization of a similar scenario in the experiments .",
    "below the temperature of the superconducting transition , we observed a sharp disappearance of the potential of both the electron sound wave and the acoustic wave , which contradicts our theoretical estimations and generally adopted conceptions of the behavior of the longitudinal electric field in superconductors .",
    "the origin of this puzzling effect , as well as the nature of the elastic signal of the electron sound in the superconductor , is not clear yet ."
