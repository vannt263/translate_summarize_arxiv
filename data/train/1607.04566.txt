    "one useful explanation that is often given is to observe that the feynman - kac formula establishes a link between random walks on the weighted graph and the evolution of the heat equation .",
    "we observe that random walks have a tendency to be trapped in clusters and are unlikely to cross over bottlenecks and , simultaneously , that the evolution of the heat equation can be explicitely given as @xmath8(x ) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{e^{-\\lambda_n^2 t } \\left\\langle f , \\phi_n \\right\\rangle \\phi_n(x)}.\\ ] ] the exponential decay @xmath9 implies that the long - time dynamics is really governed by the low - lying eigenfunctions who then have to be able to somehow reconstruct the random walks inclination for getting trapped in clusters and should thus be able to reconstruct the cluster .",
    "we believe this intuition to be useful and our further exposition will be based on this .",

    "a notable difference is the lack of decay associated with the contribution coming from higher eigenfunctions  this is closely related to the fact that the heat equation is highly smoothing while the wave equation merely preserves regularity . in one dimension , this is is easily seen using @xmath14 implying that translations @xmath15 and @xmath16 are particular solutions of the wave equation which preserve their initial roughness ) . however , the dynamics is still controlled by low - lying eigenfunctions in a time - averaged sense : note that @xmath17 \\phi_n(x ) } \\ ] ] where the integrals decay as soon as @xmath18 since @xmath19 put differently , the average behavior over a certain time interval is much smoother than the instantenous behavior .",
    "we will now prove that average considerations within the framework of the wave equation allow us to reconstruct the classical distance used in spectral embedding : then , after seeing that average considerations recover the known framework , we will investigate the behavior on shorter time - scales and use that as a way of deriving a finer approximation of the underlying geometry of the given data .",

    "points that are nearby should always have comparable levels of water and comparable levels of change in water level and this is measured by the integral norm .",
    "the exponentially decaying term @xmath66 in the evolution of the solution @xmath67 comes from actually solving for the attenuated wave equation which further reduces high - frequency shocks and increases stability .",

    "further parameters are @xmath78 = y$ ] and @xmath79 .",
    "this uniquely defines the @xmath80 individually induced distances , we always condense them into one distance using either @xmath81 generally , continuous geometries benefit from taking the minimum because of increased smoothness whereas clustering problems are better treated using the second type of combined distance .",
    "a benefit of the refined wave echolocation metric is that , unlike heat , the transmission between two clusters does not simply depend on the number of edges but also their topology .",
    "we consider two clusters in @xmath82 each of which consists of a 1000 points arranged in a unit disk and the two unit disks are well - separated  the obstruction comes from a large number of random edges ; specifically , every point is randomly connected to 4% in the other cluster .",
    "heat diffuses quickly between these two clusters due to the large number of intra cluster connections . for this reason",
    ", the heat embedding of the fails to separate the clusters ( however , it is does preserve some aspects of the topology , see fig .",
    "[ fig : randerrorembeddings ] ) .",
    "in contrast , however , the wave echolocation metric manages a clear separation of objects .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure [ fig : dumbbell ] compares the eigenfunction @xmath83 of the laplacian compared to the first non - trivial eigenfunction of the heat equation distance matrix .",
    "we observe that the refined heat metric is a much better approximation to the function @xmath84 than @xmath83 and allows for a more accurate reconstruction of the bridge .",
    "we also observe that the nontrivial eigenfunction is essentially and to a remarkable degree constant on the two clusters which further increases its value as a classifier .",
    "_ summary . _ we have presented a new pre - processing technique for classical dimensionality reduction techniques based on spectral methods . the underlying new idea comes in three parts : ( 1 ) if one computes eigenfunctions of the laplacian , then one might just as well use them so simulate the evolution of a partial differential equation on the existing weighted graph , ( 2 ) especially for physically meaningful dynamical systems such as the wave equation one would expect points with high affinity to behave similarly throughout time and ( 3 ) this motivates the construction of a refined metric extracting information coming from the behavior of the dynamical system . + _ the wave equation .",
    "_ we were originally motivated by a series of desirable properties of the wave equation on @xmath85 : preservation of regularity and finite speed of propagation .",
    "recall that one of the fundamental differences between the heat equation and the wave equation is that solutions of the heat equation experience an instanteneous gain in smoothness while the wave equation merely preserves the smoothness of the initial datum ( and sometimes not even that ) .",
    "our main point is to show that this is not arbitrary but due to physical phenomena whose counterparts in the world of data can provide a refined measurement : _ the lack of regularity can be helpful _ !",
    "however , as we have shown , there are similar effects for most other partial differential equations and theoretical justifications on a precise enough level that they would distinguish between various dynamical systems are still missing ",
    "we believe this to be a fascinating open problem . + _ refined metrics .",
    "_ similarily , our way of refining metrics , either by taking the minimum or by compiling an average , is motivated by considerations ( see also @xcite ) that are not specifically tuned to our use of partial differential equations  another fascinating open question is whether there is a more natural and attuned way of extracting information . + * acknowledgement .",
