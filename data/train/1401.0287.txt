    "a probability distribution function ( pdf ) which models a given physical variable is usually defined in the interval @xmath0 . as an example the exponential , the gamma , the lognormal ,",
    "the pareto and the weibull pdfs are defined in such interval , see @xcite .",
    "we now briefly review the status of the research on the truncated gamma distribution ( tg ) .",
    "a first attempt to deduce the parameters of a tg can be found in @xcite , @xcite derived the minimum variance unbiased estimate of the reliability function associated with the tg distribution which is right truncated , @xcite estimated the parameters of a tg distribution over @xmath1 , adopting the maximum likelihood estimator(mle ) , @xcite studied the properties of tg distributions and derived the simulation algorithms which dominate the standard algorithms for these distributions , @xcite considered a doubly - truncated gamma random variable restricted by both a lower ( l ) and upper ( u ) truncation .    on adopting an astronomical point of view the left truncation is connected with the minimum mass of a star , @xmath2 and the right truncation with the maximum mass of a star , @xmath3 , see @xcite .",
    "this paper first review the gamma pdf , introduces the right and left truncated gamma pdf and finally analyzes two samples of stars and brown dwarfs ( bd ) .",
    "this section reviews the gamma pdf , introduces the truncated gamma pdf and analyzes the data of two astronomical samples .",

    "its expected value is @xmath11 and its variance , @xmath12 the mode is at @xmath13 the distribution function ( df ) is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the lower incomplete gamma function , see @xcite .",
    "the two parameters can be estimated by matching the moments @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the sample variance and the sample mean .",

    "its expected value is @xmath25 the mode is at @xmath26 but in order to exist the inequality @xmath27 should be satisfied . the distribution function is @xmath28 a random number generation can be implemented by solving for @xmath5 the following nonlinear equation @xmath29 where we have a pudendum number generator giving random numbers @xmath30 between zero and one , see @xcite .",
    "a simple derivation of the lower and upper boundaries gives @xmath31 a first approximate derivation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is through the standard estimation of parameters of the gamma distribution .",
    "we compute the @xmath34 with these first values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 and we search a numerical couple which gives the minimum @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath34 is computed according to the formula @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of bins , @xmath37 is the theoretical value , and @xmath38 is the experimental value represented by the frequencies .",

    "the goodness of the fit can be expressed by the probability @xmath43 , see equation 15.2.12 in @xcite , which involves the degrees of freedom and the @xmath34 . the akaike information criterion ( aic ) , see @xcite , is defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the likelihood function and @xmath22 the number of free parameters in the model .",
    "we assume a gaussian distribution for the errors and the likelihood function can be derived from the @xmath34 statistic @xmath46 where @xmath34 has been computed by equation  ( [ chisquare ] ) , see  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "now the aic becomes @xmath47      a first test is performed on the low - mass initial mass function in the young cluster ngc 6611 , see @xcite .",

    "the right or left tg pdf has been extensively investigated in the field of mathematics , as an example @xcite reports most of the mathematical details .",
    "the application of the tg pdf in astronomy represents conversely a new promising field .",

    "the application of the tg pdf to the imf is positive and both the reduced @xmath34 and the k - s test give better results in respect to the standard pdfs used by the astronomers which are the lognormal and the four power laws , see tables [ chi2valuesngc6611 ] and [ chi2valuesngc2362 ] .",
    "a comparison with the left truncated beta pdf , see tables 1 and 2 in @xcite allows to say that the left truncated beta pdf produces a better fit to the imf in respect to the truncated gamma pdf here analyzed .",
