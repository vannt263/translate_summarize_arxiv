    "the majority of these systems are wide separation binaries , with semi - major axis @xmath5 au . at the same time , four relatively small separation binaries with @xmath6 au ( hd 196885 , @xmath1 cephei , gl 86 and hd 41004 ; chauvin 2011 ) are also known to harbor giant planets with projected masses @xmath7 . in these systems the mass of the secondary star ( we call `` secondary '' the binary component other than the star orbited by the planet , which we denote as `` primary '' ) @xmath8 is found to be close to @xmath9 and binary eccentricity @xmath10 is close to @xmath11 . also , dumusque ( 2012 )",

    "orbits the star at @xmath15 au separation .",
    "the uniqueness of these systems lies in the fact that forming planets in them is known to provide extreme challenge to planet formation theories ( zhou 2012 ) . with the exception of @xmath0 cen and gl 86 , planets in these binaries reside in rather wide orbits , with planetary semi - major axes @xmath16 au . in - situ",
    "formation of these gas giants is expected to proceed through continuous agglomeration of planetesimals at these locations , starting from very small objects ( easily @xmath17 km ) .",
    "however , gravitational perturbations from the eccentric stellar companion inevitably result in rapid secular evolution ( heppenheimer 1978 ) , driving planetesimal eccentricities far above the level at which bodies can avoid destruction in mutual collisions ( thbault 2008 ) .",
    "this problem , which is often called _ collisional _ or _ fragmentation barrier _ , is especially severe for small planetesimals , @xmath18 km in size , for which the ratio of binding to kinetic energy is small .",
    "it is also more pronounced far from the primary , where the secular forcing by the companion is strongest and planetesimal eccentricities are high .",
    "marzari & scholl ( 2000 ) suggested that a combination of secular forcing by the companion and gas drag acting on small ( @xmath19 km ) planetesimals leads to apsidal alignment of their orbits , resulting in smaller relative velocities , and allowing colliding objects to grow .",
    "however , thbault ( 2006 , 2008 ) demonstrated that the planetesimal size - dependence of apsidal alignment acts to break orbital phasing between objects of different sizes , resulting in high velocity collisions between them and reinforcing collisional barrier .",
    "interestingly , most studies of planetesimal growth in small separation binaries have included the effect of the protoplanetary disk on planetesimal dynamics only via associated gas drag ( thbault 2004 , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 ; paardekooper 2008 ; paardekooper & leinhardt 2010 ) , without accounting for the _ gravitational _ effect of the disk .",
    "batygin ( 2011 ) have considered disk gravity in the context of planet formation and evolution in systems with highly misaligned , distant ( @xmath20 au ) stellar companions , affected by the lidov - kozai effect ( lidov 1961 ; kozai 1962 ) . however",
    ", this effect is probably irrelevant for planetesimal dynamics in small separation ( tens of au ) binaries , which are likely coplanar with circumstellar disks .    in this letter",
    "we show that apsidal precession of planetesimal orbits induced by disk gravity dominates secular evolution of planetesimals at separations of several au . as a result , relative velocities at which bodies collide are reduced , sometimes by more than an order of magnitude . in massive disks",
    "this effect presents a natural solution of the fragmentation barrier issue for the in - situ formation of the giant planets in small separation binaries , such as @xmath1 cephei .",
    "we consider planetesimal motion as keplerian motion around the primary perturbed by the gravity of the companion , that moves on larger , eccentric orbit , and the disk .",
    "mass of the primary is @xmath21 , and we define @xmath22 . we assume eccentricity of the stellar binary @xmath10 to be small and planetesimal orbit to be _ coplanar _ with the binary .",
    "planetesimals are immersed in a massive , axisymmetric gaseous disk , characterized by surface density @xmath23 specified in  [ sect : disk ] .",
    "assuming @xmath24 the secular ( averaged over the planetesimal and binary orbital motion ) disturbing function for a planetesimal with semimajor axis @xmath25 and eccentricity vector @xmath26 ( with apsidal angle @xmath27 counted from the binary apsidal line , which is assumed fixed ) is ( murray & dermott 1999 ) r = na^2 , [ eq : r ] where a & = & ( 1+e_b^2 ) , [ eq : a ] + b & = & e_b ( 1+e_b^2 ) , [ eq : b ] and _ d=- ( + ) |_r = a [ eq : disk_prec ] is the precession frequency of planetesimal orbit due to the disk potential @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath30 are the mean motions of the binary and planetesimal , respectively .",
    "the contribution to @xmath31 proportional to @xmath32 arises from expansion of the disk potential along the eccentric planetesimal orbit and averaging over its mean longitude .",
    "evolution equations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 are written using @xmath35 , @xmath36 as = ( a+_d)k - b ,   = -(a+_d)h .",

    "planetesimals starting on circular orbits have @xmath43 so that their eccentricity oscillates with amplitude @xmath44 and period @xmath45 .",
    "we model the disk as a constant @xmath46 disk extending out to the outer truncation radius @xmath47 .",
    "numerical simulations of accretion disks in binaries suggest that @xmath48 ( zhou 2012 ) , depending on @xmath10 and @xmath49 . in our study",

[ eq : sig ] from this it is obvious that if the disk temperature scales as @xmath53 then the surface density behaves as ( r)=_0()^p ,   p =- q , [ eq : sig1 ] where @xmath54 is some fiducial radius and @xmath55",
    ".    models of protoplanetary disks typically find @xmath56 to be close to @xmath57 , so that @xmath58 .",
    "in particular , the passive disk model of chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) has @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 .",
    "outer parts of a disk in a binary are additionally heated by the radiation of the companion and tidal dissipation , so that @xmath56 may be lower than @xmath61 even for a passive disk . for simplicity ,",
    "in our calculations we will assume @xmath62 , which corresponds to a classical mestel disk ( mestel 1963 ) if @xmath63 .",
    "assuming that the disk has power law profile ( [ eq : sig1 ] ) with @xmath62 all the way to @xmath47 we can express its surface density via the total disk mass @xmath64 enclosed within @xmath47 as ( r)r^-1 2800  ^-2 r_t,5 ^ -1 r_1 ^ -1 , [ eq : sig3 ] where @xmath65au ) , and @xmath66au ) .",
    "interestingly , gas surface density at 1 au in such a disk with @xmath67 is not very different from that in a minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ; hayashi 1981 ) .      a disk with the density profile ( [ eq : sig1 ] ) with @xmath62 extending to infinity",
    "is known to have constant circular velocity ( mestel 1963 ) v_c=(r)^1/2 = ( 2g_0 r_0)^1/2 .",
    "[ eq : v_c ] expressing @xmath68 from this relation and plugging it in equation ( [ eq : disk_prec ] ) we find @xmath69 , where from now on we use @xmath70 instead of @xmath25 .",
    "even though the circumprimary disk in our problem is truncated at @xmath47 this expression should still be able to give us a reasonable estimate of the precession rate @xmath71 due to the disk potential for @xmath72 .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : sig3 ] ) we find _ d - r^-2=-n .",
    "[ eq : omega_p ] note that @xmath71 varies rather weakly with @xmath70 , as @xmath73 , which is consistent with batygin ( 2011 ) .      to assess the role of disk - driven precession on secular evolution of planetesimals we evaluate 20r_1 ^ -2 , [ eq : ratio ] where @xmath74au ) . in making this estimate",
    "we neglected the term quadratic in @xmath10 in equation ( [ eq : a ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that dynamics of planetesimals at several au is strongly affected by the disk - driven precession .",
    "indeed , @xmath75 exceeds @xmath76 for rr_cr4.6 ( ) ^1/2 , [ eq : r_cr ] i.e. over essentially the whole assumed extent of the disk even for the disk mass as small as @xmath77 m@xmath78 .",
    "thus , if we are interested in planet formation at @xmath79 au we can neglect planetesimal precession due to the secondary compared to the disk - driven precession , i.e. neglect @xmath76 compared to @xmath71 in equation ( [ eq : forced_part ] ) and other formulae .",
    "equation ( [ eq : forced_part ] ) then predicts that the amplitude of eccentricity oscillations is e^disk(r)&= & e_b [ eq : ampl ] + & & 310 ^ -3 r_1 ^ 3 , where we again neglected @xmath80 term in equation ( [ eq : b ] ) .",
    "this is to be compared with e^n / disk(r)=e_b 6.310 ^ -2 , [ eq : ampl1 ] which one finds neglecting disk - driven precession , i.e. dropping @xmath71 in equation ( [ eq : forced_part ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that neglecting disk - driven precession leads to an _ overestimate _ of the planetesimal eccentricity at @xmath81au separations by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this has important consequences for planetesimal growth as we discuss further",
    ".      equation ( [ eq : ampl ] ) accounts for the presence of the disk only through the precession caused by its gravity .",
    "however , for small planetesimals the effect of gas drag is also important . assuming quadratic drag force in the form @xmath82 ( here @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the object s radius and bulk density , @xmath85 is the gas density and @xmath33 is the disk scale height ) we account for its effect on planetesimal dynamics by adding terms @xmath86 to the first and second equations ( [ eq : evol_eqs ] ) , respectively ( marzari & scholl 2000 ) . here",
    "d = n = n .",
    "[ eq : d ]    for small planetesimal sizes ( to be specified later by equation ( [ eq : d_t ] ) ) , in the gas drag - dominated regime , the drag force balances eccentricity excitation due to the secondary , i.e. the @xmath87 term in the first equation ( [ eq : evol_eqs ] ) .",
    "this results in the following estimate for the gas drag - mediated planetesimal eccentricity : e_gas()^1/2= ( e_b ) ^1/2()^2 .",
    "[ eq : e_gas ] this expression agrees with paardekooper ( 2008 ) and predicts that @xmath88 . as a result , for small bodies",
    "one finds @xmath89 .",
    "the transition between the drag - dominated behavior ( [ eq : e_gas ] ) and the drag - free eccentricity scaling ( [ eq : ampl ] ) occurs at the planetesimal size @xmath90 where these two equations yield the same eccentricity : d_gas & & e_forced^2= e_b [ eq : d_t ] + & & 1   , where @xmath91 g @xmath92 , @xmath93 and we have used equation ( [ eq : sig3 ] ) .",
    "planetesimal eccentricity behaves according to formula ( [ eq : e_gas ] ) for @xmath94 , and switches to drag - free regime ( [ eq : ampl ] ) for @xmath95 , see figure [ fig : d_r ] .",
    "the dependence of @xmath90 on gas disk density and mass  @xmath96  is somewhat counter - intuitive , since higher gas density results in stronger drag , making it more important for _ larger _ bodies .",
    "however , the gas - free planetesimal eccentricity ( [ eq : ampl ] ) is itself a function of @xmath64 and decreases _ faster _ with increasing @xmath64 than does @xmath97 , explaining the nontrivial @xmath98 dependence .",
    "planetesimals grow in mutual collisions as long as their encounter velocity @xmath99 ( measured at infinity ) is such that collisions do not result in the net loss of mass . the conditions for this depend , in particular , on planetesimal size and on whether planetesimals are strength- or gravity - dominated .",
    "using results of leinhardt & stewart ( 2012 ) for collisions of equal mass ( the most disruptive ) strengthless bodies we roughly estimate the condition for planetesimal growth to be v_coll2v_esc , [ eq : cond ] where the escape speed from the surface of an object of radius @xmath83 and bulk density @xmath84 is v_esc=(g)^1/2d1.3  ^-1_3 ^ 1/2d_1 [ eq : vesc ] ( here @xmath100 km ) ) .",
    "it becomes harder to break planetesimals when they are small enough for their internal strength to dominate over the gravitational energy , which is expected to happen for @xmath101 km ( holsapple 1994 ) .",
    "planetesimal collisions occur at velocity of order @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the keplerian speed . using expression ( [ eq : ampl ] )",
    "we find v_coll(r)90  ^-1 r_1 ^ 5/2 .",
    "[ eq : vcoll ] plugging equations ( [ eq : vesc ] ) and ( [ eq : vcoll ] ) into the condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) we find that erosion in equal - mass planetesimal collisions is avoided for bodies with @xmath104 , where d_coll35   ( ) ^1/2 r_1 ^ 5/2 .",
    "[ eq : d_coll ] thus , for the fiducial binary parameters adopted here and for @xmath105 only planetesimals larger than @xmath106 km would be able to grow at 1 au . at 2 au  the semi - major axis of @xmath1 cephei ab  only bodies larger than @xmath107 km in radius would be able to survive in equal - mass collisions .",
    "however , in the absence of a disk the problem is much worse : evaluating collisional velocity as @xmath108 using equation ( [ eq : ampl1 ] ) and applying condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) one finds than in the absence of disk - induced precession only planetesimals larger than d_coll^n / disk700   ( ) ^1/2a_b,20 ^ -1 r_1 ^ 1/2 [ eq : d_coll1 ] are able to survive in equal - mass collisions .",
    "clearly , collisional barrier appears _",
    "far _ more severe if one disregards the effects of the disk on the secular evolution of planetesimals .",
    "we compare the behavior of @xmath90 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 as a function of @xmath70 in figure [ fig : d_r ] .",
    "we also point out that @xmath109 is very sensitive to the binary semi - major axis @xmath111 , unlike @xmath110 , see equations ( [ eq : d_coll ] ) and ( [ eq : d_coll1 ] ) : increasing @xmath111 from 20 au to 30 au reduces @xmath109 by a factor of @xmath112 .",
    "the size of the region where disk - driven precession dominates secular evolution also expands rapidly with increasing @xmath111 , see equation ( [ eq : r_cr ] ) .",
    "to summarize , properly accounting for the disk gravity considerably alleviates the collisional barrier in binaries , certainly for @xmath113 au .",
    "we now propose a solution to the problem of planetesimal accumulation in binaries , raised in  [ sect : intro ] . we argue that if    * disk is _ massive _ , @xmath114 , * planetesimals are _ strength - dominated below @xmath115 _ km ,",
    "then the fragmentation barrier can be overcome even at separations of @xmath116 au , where planets in several binaries are found .",
    "equation ( [ eq : d_coll ] ) shows that higher @xmath64 results in smaller planetesimal size @xmath109 , below which strengthless objects are destroyed or eroded in equal - mass collisions .",
    "smaller planetesimals are ( 1 ) more resistive to collisional erosion because of their internal strength and ( 2 ) stronger affected by gas drag .",
    "when the latter dominates , planetesimal velocities are reduced and collisions are less destructive . however , increasing @xmath64 reduces not only @xmath109 but also @xmath90 in such a way that @xmath117 stays constant . at 1",
    "au this ratio is about 30 so that independent of @xmath64 there is still a significant `` danger zone '' between the planetesimal size @xmath90 below which gas drag lowers @xmath99 helping accretion and the radius @xmath109 above which colliding strengthless bodies can grow , see figure [ fig : d_r ] .    on the other hand , equation ( [ eq : d_coll1 ] )",
    "predicts that @xmath118 at @xmath119 au for @xmath120 , if internal strength dominates over the gravitational binding energy of the body with @xmath121 km making it harder to erode or destroy .",
    "this is a resolution of the collisional barrier problem in binaries that we favor in this work .    to avoid fragmentation barrier",
    "we thus require that @xmath122 . using equation ( [ eq : d_coll ] ) we can rephrase this condition in the form of a lower limit on the disk mass at a given separation @xmath123 from the primary : 0.035   ( ) ^1/2",
    "a_pl^5/2a_b,20 ^ -3 .",
    "[ eq : phase ] in figure [ fig : phase ] we illustrate this constraint as a function of the binary semi - major axis , for different values of @xmath123 .",
    "it is clear that in _ very small _ separation binaries with @xmath124 au growing planets even at 1 au requires a massive disk , @xmath125 .",
    "external companions in giant planet - hosting binaries typically have mass @xmath126 ( chauvin 2011 ) , meaning that our scenario of planet formation at 2 au needs @xmath127",
    ". such disk mass may seem high but it is also the case that planet - hosting binary systems with @xmath6 au that we consider here contain more mass in total than the descendants of the typical t tauri stars .",
    "one might worry that such massive disks would be prone to gravitational instability ( gi ) . with the density profile ( [ eq : sig3 ] )",
    "we estimate the toomre @xmath128 ( @xmath129 is the sound speed ) as q2 3 ( ) ( ) .",
    "[ eq : q ] thus , even for @xmath130 the disk is at most marginally unstable to gi at @xmath131 au .",
    "however , even if it were unstable , the surface density and optical depth at this distance would be so high that the cooling time would far exceed the local dynamical time , making planet formation by direct disk fragmentation impossible ( gammie 2001 ; rafikov 2005 ) . instead",
    ", the disk would slowly evolve under the action of gravitoturbulence ( rafikov 2009 ) .",
    "on the other hand , high @xmath64 simplifies planet formation in other ways .",
    "in particular , planets in these systems are quite massive ( chauvin 2011 ) and larger @xmath64 provides mass reservoir for their assembly . higher surface density of the protoplanetary disk also means larger isolation mass ( lissauer 1993 ) possibly making it high enough at 2 au to trigger core accretion without the need to go through the long - lasting stage of giant impacts ( chambers 2004 ) .",
    "higher @xmath132 likely implies larger dead zone ( gammie 1996 ) in the disk , providing quiet conditions for planetesimal formation and growth , and resulting in smaller viscosity , which , possibly , means longer disk lifetime .",
    "the timescale on which planets form also goes down as @xmath64 increases .",
    "another potential solution to the collisional barrier problem in binaries is the direct formation of large planetesimals by e.g. streaming and/or gravitational instabilities ( johansen 2007 ; thbault 2011 ) .",
    "large @xmath64 and small @xmath109 are helpful for this mechanism as well since to overcome fragmentation barrier in a massive disk such instabilities would only need to produce bodies with sizes of tens of km , rather than @xmath133 km dwarf planets .",
    "we now mention several additional factors that may strengthen or weaken our conclusions .",
    "first , our collisional growth condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) may be too stringent .",
    "previously , using a more refined fragmentation criterion thbault ( 2011 ) found that in hd 196885 ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 au@xmath136 ) planetesimal growth is possible even in the absence of disk - driven precession at @xmath137 au as long as the planetesimal size exceeds 250 km .",
    "however , according to our formula ( [ eq : d_coll1 ] ) with the same assumptions ( same system parameters and @xmath138 ) , growth is possible only for @xmath139 km .",
    "thus , our fragmentation criterion likely _ overestimates _ planetesimal size above which objects grow efficiently , and , in fact , it might be _ easier _ to overcome the fragmentation barrier with the more realistic growth condition than our simple criterion ( [ eq : cond ] ) . at a given distance",
    "this would _ lower _ the value of @xmath64 needed to overcome fragmentation barrier .",
    "second , even if planetesimals are collisionally weak their growth may still proceed mainly via unequal - mass collisions ( which more frequently result in mergers ) if the number of relatively massive objects is small ( thbault 2011 ) .",
    "outward migration of planets by scattering of planetesimals has also been invoked ( payne 2009 ) to explain planets on au - scale orbits in small separation binaries .    on the other hand , there are also factors complicating planetesimal growth",
    ". in particular , eccentricity of the gaseous disk induced by the companion may affect planetary growth at small sizes ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "also , gas drag - induced inspiral of planetesimals may deplete the disk of some solids .",
    "the relative importance of these factors for planet formation in binaries will be assessed in the future ."
