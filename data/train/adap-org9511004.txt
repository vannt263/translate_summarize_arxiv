    "in this work we study the steady state properties of a simple discrete dynamical stochastic cellular automaton model describing the virus spread .",
    "an earlier deterministic version of the present model was proposed by landini et al  @xcite in attempt to study the morphology of herpes simplex virus ( hsv ) corneal ulcers . in this latter model",
    "two distinct populations of epithelial cells were considered accordingly with the degree of permissivity to infection by hsv .",
    "the susceptibility to viral infection by contiguity were distinguished by assuming that the permissive cells become infected by the presence of one or more infected neighbors while for the resistant ones at least @xmath2 @xmath5 infected neighbors cells are required to spread de virus .",
    "landini et al  @xcite considering a square lattice monolayer cellular automaton model ( taking into account the first eight nearest neighbors ) showed that the hsv ulcers can be quantitatively well characterized by the fractal dimension of their contour .",
    "furthermore , they shed some light to understand that the complex shape and evolution of the hsv ulcers may depend on intrinsic characteristics ( susceptibility to infection ) and topological distribution of the ephithelial cells .",
    "for instance , when the resistance parameter @xmath6 , landini s model exhibit a dramatic changes from dendritic to amoeboid morphology when the concentration of permissive cells reaches the percolation threshold .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the dynamical features of the _ hsv _ ulcers evolution , that were well described by the _ static",
    "_ model proposed by landini _",
    "we are mainly concern with the overall distribution of ulcers in the steady state that should occurs after a primary infection .",
    "nowadays it is well known that many viruses have evolved mechanisms to avoid the immune system , like e.g. adenovirus , murine and _",
    "hsv_. for instance hill _",
    "@xcite describe a new mechanism by which _",
    "hsv _ may evade the immune control .",
    "for those viruses after a primary infection the virus enters a latent phase and can reactivate later on at any time due to other factors",
    ". therefore we introduce stochastic dynamical ingredients to the model proposed by landini _",
    "@xcite to mimic regeneration of the ephithelial tissue and to consider re - infection processes due to latent virus phase . with these ingredients",
    "our model can also describe a forest fire phenomena with two distinct species of trees with different degrees of resistance to burning .",
    "actually , the particular case with @xmath4 ( one specie of tree ) recovers the self - organized critical forest fire model with lightning probability introduced by drossel and schwabl  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "two methods are employed to study the role of the resistance parameter @xmath2 on the steady state properties of the dead cell population ( destroyed trees or empty sites in the counterpart forest fire model ) :  ( a ) an analytical mean field approach and ( b ) a numerical simulation . in section",
    "ii we describe our cellular automaton model and develops the mean field approach .",
    "section iii is devoted to discuss the numeric simulation procedure .",
    "the results and discussions are given on section iv .",
    "our stochastic discrete cellular automaton is defined on a square lattice with @xmath7 sites , the sites being occupied by a permissive cell , a resistant cell , an infected cell or a dead cell .",
    "the system is parallel updated and governed by the following rules during one time step :    \\(a ) a permissive cell becomes infected by contiguity if exist one or more infected neighbor cells on it environment .",
    "\\(b ) a resistant cell becomes infected by contiguity if exist r or more infected neighbors cells on it environment .",
    "\\(c ) an infected cell becomes a dead cell .",
    "\\(d ) a living cell ( permissive or resistant ) may becomes infected with probability _ f _ if there are no enough infected neighbors on it environment .",
    "\\(e ) a dead cell may regenerates with probability _ p _ , a fraction _ q _ being permissive cells and ( 1-_q _ ) being resistant cells .",
    "\\(f ) the cell environment is defined by its eight nearest neighbors",
    ". therefore r ranges from 2 to 8 .    to study the mean field behavior of the system",
    "we will assume that the system size _",
    "l _ is large enough to prevent finite - size effects , and that the system reaches a steady state after a transient period from arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "we also assume that this steady state depends only on the model parameters and is characterized by mean values of the densities of the permissive cells @xmath8 of the resistant cells @xmath9 of the infected cells @xmath1 and that of the dead cells @xmath10 .",
    "these densities are constrained by normalization condition :    @xmath11    now let s consider the variation of these densities within one time step.the rate equation for dead cells is clearly given by    @xmath12    while for the permissive cells we have    @xmath13d_p \\label{deltadp}\\ ] ]    in eq .",
    "[ deltadp ] , the first term gives the mean number of new regenerate permissive cells and the second reads for the permissive cells becoming infected on the next time step ( rules ( a ) and ( d ) ) , @xmath14 being the probability for a given permissive cell to have one or more infected neighbors .",
    "by analogy for the rate of resistant cells we have    @xmath15d_r \\label{deltadr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the probability that a given resistant cell is surrounded by @xmath2 or more infected cells , that is    @xmath17    finally the rate of the infected cells is given by ,    @xmath18 @xmath19 f - d_i \\label{deltadi}\\ ] ]    in the above equation the first term describes the number of cells infected by contiguity in one time step , the second gives the ones infected by other means and the third clearly stands for the number of infected cells that will become dead in the next time step .",
    "the steady state is characterized by constant mean densities of all populations of cells , that is ,    @xmath20    in that conditions we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ deltadd]-[deltadr ] ) that ,    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    now substituting these expressions onto the normalization conditions ( eq.([normalization ] ) ) we finally obtain an equation for the infected cells populations as function of the model parameters ( provide @xmath24 ) given by ,    @xmath25 = 1 \\label{di}\\ ] ]    this equation , which express the mean field behavior of the system , can be solved numerically , and the figures for @xmath1 can be used to obtain the others steady state populations given by eqs .",
    "( [ dd]-[dr ] ) .",
    "we carry on numerical simulations of the present model by considering an @xmath26 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the initial state is prepared by randomly distributing permissive cells with probability @xmath27 ( arbitrary ) and resistant cells with probability @xmath28 .",
    "an infection cell is triggered on central site of the lattice .",
    "after a transient time interval ( time steps ) of the order of @xmath29 we measured all kind of cells densities and then average these values over the next @xmath29 consecutive configurations . during all processes infected cells were triggered randomly at @xmath30 time steps and regenerated cells were randomly allowed at @xmath31 time steps . as far as we are interested to investigate the possibility of occurrence of _ self - organized critical _",
    "steady states we fixed the model parameters such that @xmath32 .",
    "this is a necessary condition to allow that all living cells of an infected cluster become infected before new regenerated cells appears on the clusters ends .",
    "note that @xmath33 is the maximum time interval for infection to spread in a large living cells cluster .",
    "the _ fractal dimension _ of the contours of dead cells clusters were also estimated by the box counting method and averaged over all simulations .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the properties of the dynamic steady state of the virus spread we direct our attention to the mean density of the population of infected cells @xmath1 or mean density of fire in the counterpart forest fire model . in figure 1 , we show the dependence of @xmath1 as function of the regeneration probability @xmath34 obtained by simulation of the model on a @xmath35 square lattice with the degree of resistance varying from @xmath4 to @xmath36 , for the ratio @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we notice that the curve for @xmath39 looks qualitatively similar to the one obtained for @xmath4 ( _ soc forest fire model _ ) and is very distinct to the ones obtained for @xmath40 .",
    "those latter curves show an universal like dependence for lower values of @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the plot for @xmath41 exhibit a crossover behavior between the @xmath42 and @xmath40 curves as @xmath34 varies from lower to upper values .",
    "now we make comparison with the mean field like results obtained from eq .  [ di ] . in figure 2",
    "we display the results obtained by the mean field procedure recovering the ones obtained by simulations . for @xmath4 and @xmath43 the mean field curves are in qualitative agreement of the one obtained by simulations , while for @xmath41 one also observes the cross - over between @xmath44 and @xmath45 behaviors with a very sharp changes at small but definite value of @xmath34 . for @xmath45",
    "the agreement between both approaches is quantitatively established .    in figures 3 and 4",
    "we present the behavior of the density of dead cells ( ulcers ) as function of the regeneration probability as obtained by simulation and mean field approaches , respectively .",
    "the same qualitative and quantitative behavior observed for the density of infected cells ( figures 1 and 2 ) occurs for the dead cell density . to explore the crossover behavior observed for the @xmath41 case , we plotted in figure 5 the density of infected cells @xmath46 against the regeneration probability @xmath34 for several values of the parameter @xmath47 obtained by the mean field approach ( eq .  [ di ] ) .",
    "we observe that the mean field solution ( that is independent of finite size effects ) changes dramatically as @xmath34 approaches from a certain value which is @xmath48 dependent .",
    "as @xmath34 decreases and approaches to zero the condition @xmath49 is no longer fulfilled and the soc state disappears  @xcite .",
    "this means that clusters of resistant cells remains alive for long time intervals stopping the virus spread . in figure 6",
    ", we compare @xmath41 case obtained by both methods by showing @xmath50 plot for small values of @xmath34 .",
    "this plot indicates that for @xmath41 and for very small values of @xmath34 and for a fixed ratio @xmath48 the mean field predicted behavior is confirmed by simulations , even for finite small lattices .",
    "therefore the expected _ soc _ state for the dynamical behavior of the clusters of dead cells ( ulcers ) , similar to the one observed in the forest fire model @xmath51  @xcite for small values of @xmath34 should occurs only for @xmath39 case .    we have also investigated the dependence of the mean density of infected cells @xmath1 against the variation of the parameter @xmath52 ( the fraction of permissive regenerate cells ) for a fixed value of @xmath34 .",
    "this is shown in figure 7 from a simulation on a @xmath53 square lattice and for @xmath37 and @xmath54 .",
    "one observe the crossover behavior for the @xmath41 case as @xmath52 increases from lower to upper values .",
    "finally we have investigated the dependence of the _ fractal dimension _",
    "@xmath55 of the countour of the dead cells clusters as a function of the model parameters .",
    "the clusters were generated by simulations and after the transient time interval ( of order of @xmath29 ) the _ fractal dimension _ of ulcers contours were calculated by using the _ box counting _ method and averaged over the next @xmath29 equilibrium configuration .    in figure 8",
    "we show @xmath55 as function of small values of ( @xmath48 ) obtained for @xmath56 and for @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the figures for @xmath59 as quite similar to the ones for @xmath60 .",
    "we notice that for the models with resistant cells with @xmath61 the fractal dimension of the ulcers are very sensitive to small values of the ( @xmath48 ) parameter . under these conditions",
    "the densities of dead cells is of order of @xmath62 ( see figure 3 ) indicating that a steady state regime is achieved where small ulcers of very rough contour remain dynamically stable . for ( @xmath48 ) close to @xmath63 the ulcers frontiers are less rough for @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "this figure is close to the one estimated by box counting digitalized ulcers images of dentritic small real ulcers ( feret s diameter ranging from 1.6 t0 3.2 mm )  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand if the cell resistance is low ( @xmath66 ) this latter picture does not hold and the ulcers is allowed to spread over the whole tissue with high density and with @xmath67 .    in conclusion , we show that our present dynamical model indicates that the degree of resistance of the cell to infection by contiguity should plays an important role on the ulcer evolution . +",
