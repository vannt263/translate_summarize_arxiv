    ", a secondary nuclear rainbow appears having an airy minimum at a large angle , consistent with experiment over a range of energies , with the primary rainbow at more forward angles being somewhat obscured . in this way , including the excitation of the various collective states resolves a significant anomaly and leads to an understanding of further phenomena related to nuclear rainbow scattering  @xcite .",
    "the excitation of collective states plays an important role in the dynamics of the interactions between all pairs of nuclei . however , there is little systematic knowledge , particularly for heavy ion scattering , concerning the contribution of such collective states to the scattering potential . in this paper",
    "we shall demonstrate a means of mitigating this lack of information .",
    "the case we study , on at 330 mev , is one in which the contribution of collective states has been shown to resolve a known anomaly .",
    "the results will throw light on the limitations of standard phenomenology that is based on parameterized forms or based on folding models that lead to smooth potentials .",
    "they also suggest a richness of phenomena concerning the dynamics of interacting nuclei , including evidence for dynamically generated non - locality . the procedure exemplified in this paper",
    "is of wide applicability .",
    "section  [ dpp ] reviews relevant general properties of the dpp , section  [ model ] introduces the model and discusses the dpp due to excitations of , section  [ oxy ] presents the effects of excitations of , section  [ disco ] discusses the results and the implications , and section  [ summa ] briefly summarizes .",
    "within a potential model , the effects of channel coupling can be represented as a dynamic polarization potential , dpp , added to a folding model potential , see ref .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "the formal dpp is both @xmath1-dependent and non - local , the non - locality being in addition to that which arises from exchange processes .",
    "adding such a non - local , @xmath1-dependent potential to the folding model potential yields a potential that is itself non - local and @xmath1-dependent .",
    "such a potential is not easily comparable with local phenomenological potentials , see for example ref .",
    "however it is always possible , using @xmath7 inversion , to find a local and @xmath1-independent potential that yields the same s - matrix , and hence all elastic scattering observables , as any non - local and @xmath1-dependent potential . in this way",
    ", we can determine a potential that exactly reproduces the @xmath8-matrix of the sum of the formal dpp and the folding model potential .",
    "this local potential can be compared with potentials determined by means of precision phenomenological fitting .",
    "we shall generally refer to the local dpp found by @xmath7 inversion of the coupled channel @xmath9 , followed by subtraction of the folding model ( ` bare ' ) potential , as ` the dpp ' .",
    "however , when it is relevant that the true , formal dpp  @xcite , is non - local , we refer to this as the ` underlying dpp ' . we shall present some evidence for that non - locality .    for the particular case of proton scattering from nuclei",
    ", it has been shown  @xcite that collective excitations give rise to local dpps that are strongly undulatory .",
    "this may be related to the non - locality and/or @xmath1-dependence of the underlying formal dpp ; specific evidence concerning this non - locality for proton scattering was presented in ref .",
    "less is known about the properties of the dpp for multi - nucleon projectiles than for nucleons , apart from a few studies for lighter heavy ions and various cases of dpps generated by projectile breakup .",
    "the effects of channel coupling are commonly absorbed into an overall renormalization of a global optical model potential ( omp ) or folding model ( fm ) potential , a practice that we shall comment upon later .",
    "this procedure may be justified for those heavy ion reactions for which only the nuclear surface region is significant .",
    "the case of scattering studied here , on at some hundreds of mev , is characterized by a high degree of penetration of the two nuclei , so there is some sensitivity at large angles to the potential for almost complete overlap of the two nuclei .",
    "this motivates the determination of the dpp over a wide radial range . the coupled channel model of ref .",
    "@xcite is much more realistic than earlier models for which dpps for the same pair of nuclei were calculated  @xcite , and is validated by its detailed fit to wide angular range elastic scattering data , solving the problem of the rainbow scattering angle .    for 330 mev incident energy ,",

    "it was possible to get a slightly smoother potential by stopping the inversion process with fewer iterations , but the undulations are clearly less in amplitude than those seen in fig .",

    "[ nmc ] which shows the dpp for the excitation of just the @xmath5 state of .",
    "the undulations in the dotted line clearly arise from an interference between amplitudes , the amplitude corresponding to the @xmath6 state being very small .",
    "this can be seen from the small magnitude of the dpp for coupling to the @xmath6 state alone , which will be shown in fig .",
    "[ 3dpps ] discussed below .",
    "a comparison of the first three lines of table  [ dpps ] suggests that the @xmath6 state contributes much less to the dpp than the @xmath5 state .",
    "although the @xmath6 state does not contribute to the generation of the secondary rainbow , as seen in fig .",
    "2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , it does make a small but non - negligable contribution to the angular distribution .",
    "this is consistent with its undularity effect on the radial shape of the dpp , as noted above .",
    "although the coupling to the @xmath6 state generates clear interference effects , it is the coupling to the @xmath5 state that is the key to generating the secondary rainbow .",
    "some calculations were also carried out at 300 mev incident energy .",
    "we noted above that , for 330 mev incident energy , the dpp resulting from the simultaneous excitation of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states of @xmath11c was more undulatory when there was direct coupling between these two excitations than when there was no such direct coupling .",
    "this is not an artifact of the inversion process ; the same increased undulatory character is also observed at an incident energy of 300 mev when direct coupling is included between the excited state channels .",
    "the dpps themselves at 300 mev had the same general character as for 330 mev and the direct coupling between excitations had almost no effect on the total reaction cross section , as was also the case at 330 mev .",
    "direct coupling between inelastic excitations may therefore be a source of undulations in nucleus - nucleus interactions in general , although the mechanism is obscure at present .",
    "this deserves both theoretical and phenomenological study .",
    "although instructive and crucial for the effects reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dpps due to the excitation of the two states of are not the whole story . for the ` full ' case , the excitation of substantially modifies the dpps , see fig .",
    "[ full ] : the real part now has substantial attraction around 4 fm , leading to the 10% increase in volume integral noted above , and the imaginary part loses almost all the emissivity within 3 fm , and is somewhat deeper towards the nuclear surface . the imaginary bare potential is shallower in the full case than in the other cases .",
    "this can easily be seen in fig .",
    "the imaginary bare potential also had smaller diffusivity , as can be seen with closer inspection of this figure .    in fig .",
    "[ 3dpps ] , which directly compares the dpps implicit in the first three figures , the large attractive effect near 3.5 fm due to the excitation of is very apparent . from fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of the coupling to states of is mainly to fill in the deep minimum around @xmath26 .",
    "[ 3dpps ] also presents the very small dpp due to coupling to just the @xmath6 state of .",

    "[ sm0full ] .",
    "the different behavior of @xmath19 for the bare potential ( dashed lines ) directly reflects the lesser depth and radial extent of the bare potential in the latter case .",
    "this corresponds to the difference in reaction cross sections when there is no coupling switched on : it is 1633.6 mb for the bare potential used when only the states of are excited and 1411.7 mb for the bare potential used in the calculations when the states of are also excited . also , when comparing these figures , we see a much larger decrease in @xmath19 when coupling is included , and this is reflected in the increase in reaction cross section due to the coupling .",
    "this jumps from 15.6 mb when the states of are coupled to 70.4 mb when the states of are also included ( see lines 3 and 6 of table  [ dpps ] ) .",
    "what is somewhat surprising is the relatively small increase in @xmath14 .",
    "since the bare imaginary potential is somewhat shallower and less diffuse in the full calculation , as is consistent with the behaviour of @xmath19 as @xmath1 approaches 60 , it might be expected that the imaginary dpp would compensate for this . indeed , the reduction in @xmath19 directly due to the coupling is greater for the full calculation , but the relatively small increase in @xmath14 suggests that this is not entirely due to the imaginary dpp . the extra attraction around 3.5 fm may contribute to the absorption by attracting the nuclei into the absorptive potential .",

    "[ sm0full ] , which shows the additional effect of the states , it appears somewhat surprising that it is the excitation of the states that has the major effect on correcting the elastic scattering angular distribution .",
    "it should be noted , comparing the dashed lines in these figures , that the significantly greater diffusivity ( 0.75 fm compared with 0.6 fm ) and depth of the bare imaginary potential for the case without the excitation has greatly increased @xmath33 for @xmath1 between 40 and 60 .",

    "such regions sometimes appear in model independent fits in which the imaginary potential , over particular radial ranges , becomes small in magnitude or even positive , see for example ref .",
    "it is likely that such emissivity indicates non - locality and/or @xmath1-dependence of the underlying dpp .",
    "it is interesting that the coupling to states almost removes the emissive region in this particular case , but nevertheless the potentiality for collective coupling to generate emissivity is clear .",
    "an example that gives some insight into the very un - smooth shape of the resulting potential , and also shows what the inversion process must achieve for the full case , is shown in fig .",

    "the irregular form of @xmath9 in this @xmath1-region is presumably the result of interference between amplitudes the origin of which deserves further study .",
    "there is one respect in which the present case conforms to expectations : the last two columns of table  [ dpps ] indicate that the increase in reaction cross section induced by the collective coupling exceeds the inelastic cross section . this behaviour is not guaranteed and there are cases , e.g.  @xcite , where inelastic processes increase the total cross section by much less than the magnitude of the inelastic cross section . that is even when the total cross section includes the additional inelastic cross sections . in the present case ,",
    "when the coupling to the excited states of is included , the reaction cross section exceeds the cross section without coupling by substantially more than the total actual inelastic cross section to all the excited states ; compare the difference between 15.6 mb and 14.8 mb on line 3 of table  [ dpps ] with that between 70.4 mb and 57.4 mb in line 6 .",
    "the large value of @xmath35 cs might be a result of the attractive effect around 3.5 fm drawing the projectile flux into the absorptive region . recall that the bare potential for the full calculation has a significantly different imaginary term .",
    "the excitation of just the collective @xmath5 and @xmath6 states of , both with and without direct coupling between those states , generated rather small overall attraction or repulsion in the surface region , but did generate a deep absorptive feature in the imaginary potential together with a counter - intuitive emissive region at a small separation distance .",
    "this , together with the inexact additivity of the local dpps due to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states of without direct coupling between them , is strongly suggestive of dynamical non - locality of the underlying dpp .",
    "by contrast with the contribution of states of , for the case with full coupling the volume integral of the real potential was increased by about 10% , the largest increase being around the radius where the bare potential was about half the maximum depth . in the full case ,",
    "the emissive region at a small separation distance almost completely disappeared .",
    "it is probably true that for many nucleus - nucleus combinations and energies , the radial range over which the potential can be determined by elastic scattering data is much less than for the present case .",
    "for this reason , many discussions of the dpp due to projectile breakup , as calculated with the continuum discretized coupled - channel method  @xcite , report the dpp mostly in the surface region .",
    "in fact , even scattering is not that simple  @xcite and in that case , and quite generally for lighter ` heavy ions ' , there is considerable nuclear overlap . as a result",
    ", the effect of coupling on the nuclear interaction extends over a radial range where the dpp may have a complicated form , with the effect on the real potential being very different from a uniform renormalization .",
    "we conclude from this , and also from the present calculations , that there are situations where the quality and angular range of the experimental data make the uniform renormalization of a folding model or global model potential an inappropriate phenomenological procedure . correcting a folding model potential with a uniform normalizing factor can make sense in cases where only the surface region is relevant , but",
    "otherwise must be considered suspect .",
    "an appropriate phenomenology to exploit precise and wide angular range data would be to add a parameterized model independent correction to a global optical potential or a folding model potential .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the details of the interaction between arbitrary pairs of nuclei are beyond the reach of global models , since they will depend upon specific properties , such as the collectivities , of the particular interacting nuclei .",
    "the procedure employed in the present calculation provides a means of incorporating the particular characteristics of nuclei into a description of their elastic scattering , thus providing a means of going beyond the global models .",
    "we comment that ref .",
    "@xcite reveals the deficiency of the weighted trivially equivalent local potential , telp , which has sometimes been employed as a means of calculating the dpp .",
    "the discovery and explanation of a secondary rainbow in on elastic scattering around 300 mev provides a conclusive example of the important contribution made by collective excitations to elastic scattering between nuclei .",
    "specifically , ref .",
    "@xcite explained the occurrence of a secondary rainbow in the elastic scattering differential cross section . the scattering of on at 330 mev is sensitive to the internuclear interaction well into the overlap region , affording an opportunity to study the dpp in a situation where little is known about it .",
    "heretofore , dpps have been evaluated in particular restricted cases : where one projectile is a light nucleus , where there is no coupling model that is justified by fitting data , or where the more limited telp inversion procedure is applied . here",
    ", we have applied ip @xmath7 inversion in a case where the excitation model is validated by its fit to scattering data .",
    "this reveals that the collective excitations generate a complicated dpp with both real and imaginary parts having radial forms that depart very far the bare potentials with uniform multiplicative factors .",
    "that is , for the real dpp in particular , the effects of the coupling could not be represented by a uniform renormalization of the folding model potential .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this is a general property of collective contributions in strongly - coupled nucleus - nucleus collisions . by studying the dpps for different combinations of coupled states",
    "we have found evidence for the dynamical non - locality of the underlying dpp .    at present , a systematic understanding of the way in which collective excitations , and other channel coupling processes , modify the interaction between nuclei , is still lacking .",

    "<S> background : it was shown recently that an anomaly in the elastic scattering of on at around 300 mev is resolved by including within the scattering model the inelastic excitation of specific collective excitations of both nuclei , leading to a secondary rainbow . </S>",
    "<S> there is very little systematic knowledge concerning the contribution of collective excitations to the interaction between nuclei , particularly in the overlap region when neither interacting nuclei are light nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> purpose : to study the dynamic polarization potential ( dpp ) generated by channel coupling that has been experimentally validated for a case ( on at around 300 mev ) where scattering is sensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range ; to exhibit evidence of the non - locality due to collective coupling ; to validate , or otherwise invalidate , the representation of the dpp by uniform renormalizing folding models or global potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> methods : s - matrix to potential , @xmath0 , inversion yields local potentials that reproduce the elastic channel s - matrix of coupled channel calculations . subtracting the elastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local @xmath1-independent representation of the dpp . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the dpp on the nature of the coupled states and other parameters can be studied .    </S>",
    "<S> results : local dpps were found due to the excitation of and the combined excitation of and . </S>",
    "<S> the radial forms were different for the two cases , but each were very different from a uniform renormalization of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the full coupling led to a 10% increase in the volume integral of the real potential . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for the non - locality of the underlying formal dpp and for the effect of direct coupling between the collective states was presented ,    conclusions : the local dpp generating the secondary rainbow has been identified . in general , dpps have forms that depend on the nature of the specific excitations generating it , but as in this case , they can not be represented by a uniform renormalization of a global model or folding model potential . </S>",
    "<S> the method employed herein is a useful tool for further exploration of the contribution of collective excitations to internuclear potentials concerning which there is still remarkably little general information .    # </S>"
