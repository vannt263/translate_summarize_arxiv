    "the recent discovery of a 2 m@xmath3 neutron star puts stringent conditions on the composition and equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter in neutron star interiors @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the presence of strangeness degrees of freedom such as hyperons makes the eos softer , which is incompatible with the massive neutron star in most cases .",
    "this is known as the hyperon puzzle @xcite .",
    "describing hyperon matter in neutron stars is a challenge in many - body theories .",
    "it has been argued that the hyperon - hyperon repulsive interaction due to the exchange of strange vector meson makes the eos stiffer and might overcome the puzzle .",
    "the @xmath4-equilibrated equations of state that include hyperons were constructed after the discovery of the massive neutron star by several groups .",
    "those hyperon equations of state are found to result in 2 m@xmath3 or heavier neutron stars @xcite . besides hyperons",
    ", the antikaon condensate was also included in some calculations , which led to massive neutron stars @xcite . in all of these calculations ,",
    "the repulsive hyperon - hyperon interaction that is mediated by @xmath5 mesons was considered .",
    "many eos tables involving hyperons were developed for supernova simulations .",
    "the first hyperon eos table was prepared by @xcite . in this case , the full baryon octet was added to the shen nucleon eos table @xcite .",
    "the shen nucleon eos table was based on a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model that had the thomas - fermi approximation for the description of inhomogeneous matter below the saturation density @xcite .",
    "later , the shen nucleon eos was extended to include only @xmath0 hyperons in the hshen @xmath0 eos table @xcite .",
    "another extensively used supernova eos is the lattimer and swesty ( ls ) nucleon eos table , which based on the non - relativistic skyrme interaction @xcite .",
    "recently @xmath0 hyperons were included in the ls nucleon eos @xcite .",
    "all these hyperon eos tables were used in core collapse supernova ( ccsn ) simulations by several authors @xcite . however , none of these hyperon eos tables were consistent with the 2 m@xmath3 neutron star constraint .",
    "recently , we computed eos tables that included @xmath0 hyperons within the framework of the density dependent relativistic hadron ( ddrh ) field theory @xcite . in those eos tables ,",
    "light and heavy nuclei , as well as interacting nucleons are described in the nuclear statistical equilibrium model which takes into account the excluded volume effects @xcite .",
    "two variants of the hyperon eos tables were generated - in one case ( bhb@xmath6 ) , the repulsive @xmath0 hyperon - @xmath0 hyperon interaction mediated by @xmath5 mesons was considered , and in the other case ( bhb@xmath0 ) , this interaction was neglected .",
    "it should be noted that the ddrh model with the dd2 parameter set for nucleons is in very good agreement with the symmetry energy properties at the saturation density @xcite .",
    "we imposed the charge neutrality and @xmath4-equilibrium conditions on the bhb hyperon eos tables and calculated the mass - radius relationship of the neutron star sequence .",
    "it was observed that the maximum mass corresponding to the bhb@xmath6 eos was 2.1 m@xmath3 which is well above the recently observed massive neutron star @xcite .",
    "other hyperon eoss for @xmath4-equilibrated neutron star matter gave rise to the maximum mass neutron stars of 1.75 m@xmath3 for the hshen @xmath0 eos @xcite , 1.6 m@xmath3 for ishizuka eos @xcite , 1.91 m@xmath3 for the ls+@xmath0 eos @xcite .",
    "in this paper , for the first time , we perform supernova simulations with the bhb@xmath6 eos table , which is compatible with a 2 m@xmath3 neutron star , in the general relativistic one dimensional ( gr1d ) hydrodynamics code @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to investigate the appearance of @xmath0 hyperons in the postbounce phase and the role of @xmath0 hyperons in ccsns .",
    "furthermore , we compare our simulation results with those of previous calculations with other hyperon eos tables , particularly the hshen @xmath0 eos table @xcite .",
    "we are looking for important effects of hyperons in ccsn with the bhb@xmath6 eos compared with those of other hyperon eos .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 , the ddrh model for bhb@xmath6 eos table and the rmf model for the hshen @xmath0 eos table are described .",
    "we also briefly discuss the gr1d model for ccsn simulations .",
    "the results of our calculation are discussed and compared with those of the hshen @xmath0 eos in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains the summary and conclusions .",
    "first first we shall discuss the salient feature of the bhb@xmath1 and hshen @xmath0 eos tables for ccsn simulations @xcite .",
    "the eos tables are functions of three parameters i.e. baryon number density , temperature , and proton fraction . in both cases ,",
    "the compositions of matter that vary from one region to the other depending on those parameters are nuclei , ( anti)neutrons , ( anti)protons , ( anti)@xmath0 hyperons , photons plus electrons and positrons that form a uniform background .",
    "the contribution of ( anti)neutrinos is not added to the eos tables and is dealt with separately .",
    "we describe the baryonic contribution below .      in the bhb@xmath1 eos table , the nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) model of @xcite",
    "is applied for the description of the matter made of light and heavy nuclei , and unbound nucleons at low temperatures and below the saturation density , whereas the high density matter is described within the framework of the ddrh model adopting the rmf approximation @xcite . the repulsive interaction between @xmath0 hyperons mediated by @xmath5 mesons",
    "is included in the rmf model .",
    "nucleon - meson couplings in the ddrh model are density dependent .",
    "the dd2 parameter set of nucleon - meson couplings is used to describe the nuclear matter properties @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the nuclear eos in the ddrh model using dd2 parameter set is known as hs(dd2 ) @xcite .    on the other hand , the uniform matter at high density and temperature in the hshen @xmath0 eos table",
    "was described within the framework of the rmf model including nonlinear terms in @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons @xcite ; non - uniform matter at low temperatures and below the saturation density was considered as a mixture of alpha particles , heavy nuclei , and unbound nucleons .",
    "heavy nuclei were calculated using the thomas - fermi approach .",
    "the shen eos exploited the single nucleus approximation for heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the interaction among @xmath0 hyperons due to @xmath5 mesons was neglected in this case .",
    "furthermore , in this case baryon - meson couplings of the rmf model are density - independent .",
    "we denote the eoss with and without @xmath0 hyperons as hshen @xmath0 and hshen , respectively .",
    "the parameter set from @xcite that is known as the tm1 set was adopted for the nucleon - meson coupling constants of the rmf model .    the nuclear matter saturation properties of two rmf models discussed above are recorded in table [ table ] .",
    "it should be noted that though the incompressibility of nuclear matter , symmetry energy , and its slope coefficient of the dd2 set at the saturation density are in very good agreement with experimental values @xcite , the corresponding quantities of the tm1 set are not .",
    "this would have serious bearing on the description of high density matter in the rmf model of hshen @xcite .",
    "for both eos tables , @xmath0 hyperon - vector meson couplings are estimated from the su(6 ) symmetry relations @xcite and @xmath0 hyperon - scalar meson coupling is obtained from the hypernuclei data .",
    "the @xmath0 hyperon potential depth is -30 mev in normal nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the eoss of @xmath4-equilibrated and charge neutral cold neutron star matter with and without @xmath0 hyperons are calculated from the supernova eos tables .",
    "the maximum masses of cold neutron stars without @xmath0 hyperons for hs(dd2 ) and hshen eos are given by table [ table ] .",
    "furthermore , the maximum masses of cold neutron stars corresponding to the bhb@xmath6 and hshen @xmath0 are 2.1 m@xmath3 and 1.75 m@xmath3 @xcite , respectively .    for ccsn simulations , we make use of the hs(dd2 ) , bhb@xmath1 , hshen and hshen @xmath0 eos tables which are available from the stellarcollapse.org website .",
    "we perform the ccsn simulations using the spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamics code gr1d which was developed by @xcite .",
    "microphysical eoss for supernova matter and an approximate treatment of neutrinos in the pre- and postbounce phases are implemented in the gr1d code .",
    "we use the bhb@xmath1 and hshen @xmath0 eos tables in ccsn simulations with the gr1d code .",
    "three neutrino species denoted by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are considered in this model @xcite .",
    "key aspects of neutrino heating and cooling are incorporated into the model .",
    "the leakage scheme @xcite exploited in the gr1d code gives approximate number and energy emission rates .",
    "the neutrino heating rate considered here involves the scale factor @xmath12 which could be enhanced beyond the normal value of 1 to achieve additional neutrino heating for `` successful '' ccsn explosions @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath13 in ccsn simulations , if not stated otherwise .    in principle",
    ", an accurate and expensive neutrino treatment should be based on the boltzmann neutrino transport .",
    "however , computationally efficient schemes for neutrinos are employed in the gr1d code for faster ccsn simulations .",
    "moreover , it has been noted that the results obtained in ccsn simulations using the simplified treatment of neutrino leakage and heating in the gr1d were quantitatively similar to the results obtained from one dimensional ( 1d ) simulations with the boltzmann neutrino transport by other groups @xcite . it was argued that progenitor structures played more important roles in the collapse of a protoneutron star ( pns ) to a black hole than the details of neutrino treatment @xcite .",
    "now we report our investigations on ccsns within the gr1d code using the hshen @xmath0 hyperon and bhb@xmath1 eos tables . in these studies , nonrotating progenitors of @xcite ( wh07 ) are used . in their stellar evolution studies",
    "@xcite evolved zero age main - sequence ( zams ) stars with solar metallicity denoted by the prefix @xmath2 before presupernova models , followed by zams mass .",
    "significant mass loss was reported in @xmath2wh07 presupernova models @xcite .",
    "we perform the ccsn simulations with presupernova models as recorded in table [ table1 ] . in all numerical calculations ,",
    "we fix the neutrino heating factor @xmath13 . in the next paragraphs , we discuss the results of simulations starting from the gravitational collapse of the iron core followed by the core bounce to the postbounce evolution of the pns for @xmath240wh07 and @xmath223wh07 models with the hshen @xmath0 and bhb@xmath1 eos tables in details . in all of these simulations ,",
    "a shock wave is launched at the core bounce , it stalls after traversing a few 100 km , then recedes and becomes an accretion shock . because neutrinos in the 1d ccsn model could not revive the shock , the pns shrinks due to mass accretion and its density and temperature increase during the postbounce evolution .",
    "this leads to the appearance of @xmath0 hyperons in the pns .",
    "for @xmath240wh07 , the core bounce occurs at 0.273 and 0.321 s , corresponding to the hshen @xmath0 hyperon and bhb@xmath1 eos , respectively .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath223wh07 model the core bounce times for the hshen @xmath0 and the bhb@xmath1 eos are 0.266 and 0.315 s , respectively .",
    "the appearance of strangeness or @xmath0 hyperons in the postbounce phase and its role in the evolution of the pns are the main focuses of this investigation . for",
    "@xmath240wh07 and @xmath223wh07 models and both hyperon eos tables , @xmath0 hyperons do not populate the pns at the core bounce . in simulations with both presupernova models ,",
    "strangeness in the form of @xmath0 hyperons sets in a few hundred milliseconds ( ms ) after the core bounce and increases with time thereafter .",
    "figure 1 depicts the pns compositions as a function of radius at two different postbounce times for @xmath240wh07 with the hshen @xmath0 ( left panel ) and bhb@xmath1 ( right panel ) eos tables . for postbounce time ( @xmath14 ) 0.31 s , the central value of @xmath0 fraction is higher for the bhb@xmath1 eos than that of the hshen @xmath0 hyperon eos .",
    "the profile of @xmath0 hyperons is wider in the latter case .",
    "we find similar trends for @xmath0 hyperons at a later time @xmath15 0.51 s. for both eos tables , the population of @xmath0s increases with time .",
    "it is to be noted that the central value of the @xmath0 fraction is a high density effect , whereas the off - centre @xmath0s are populated thermally .",
    "we study the density and temperature profiles to understand this behaviour .",
    "the density profiles as a function of radius are plotted for @xmath240hw07 at the bounce as well as for @xmath16 0.31 and 0.51 s in figure 2 .",
    "the left panel of the figure corresponds to the hshen @xmath0 eos and the right panel implies the results of the bhb@xmath1 eos . at the bounce , the central density ( @xmath17 ) of the pns in both cases is just above the normal nuclear matter density , as evident by the figure . though the density profiles for both eos tables are quantitatively the same at @xmath18 0 , they differ at later times . the central density at @xmath18 0.51 in the right panel is higher than that of the left panel . in both cases ,",
    "the central density exceeds two times the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "this high central density facilitates a significant population of @xmath0s in the core of the pns , as seen in fig .",
    "however , the density falls well below normal nuclear matter density at the tail of the profile .",
    "the off - centre @xmath0s in fig . 1 could not be attributed to the density effect .",
    "the temperature profiles as a function of radius are shown for @xmath240wh07 , with the hshen @xmath0 hyperon ( left panel ) and the bhb@xmath1 ( right panel ) eos tables in figure 3 . just as in figure 2 , the temperatures profiles are plotted at the core bounce and @xmath18 0.31 and 0.51 s in both panels of figure 3 .",
    "the peaks of temperature profiles located away from the centre of the pns for both eoss after the core bounce later shift toward the centre with time in both panels .",
    "it is to be noted that the central temperature at the bounce is higher for the bhb@xmath1 eos compared with the corresponding temperature for the hshen @xmath0 eos .",
    "furthermore , the peak temperature around 8 km at 0.51 s after core bounce in the case of the bhb@xmath1 eos is much higher than the corresponding scenario for the hshen @xmath0 eos .",
    "this high temperature results in thermally produced @xmath0 hyperons away from the centre of the pns as shown in figure 1 . we find from figure 1 that thermal @xmath0s are more abundant around 8 km at later times for the bhb@xmath1 eos due to a higher peak temperature .",
    "we also study profiles of particle fraction , density , and temperature for @xmath223wh07 using both hyperon eos tables as shown in figures 4 - 6 .",
    "we obtain qualitatively similar results for @xmath223wh07 as we have already discussed for @xmath240wh07 .",
    "now we focus on the postbounce evolution of the pns for different presupernova models with nuclear and @xmath0 hyperon eos tables corresponding to the hshen and bhb models .",
    "figure 7 exhibits the evolution of the central density of the pns with the postbounce times for @xmath240wh07 ( left panel ) and @xmath223wh07 ( right panel ) .",
    "results are shown in both panels for the hshen nuclear eos , the hshen @xmath0 eos , the hs(dd2 ) nuclear eos and the bhb@xmath1 eos .",
    "it should be noted that the core bounce time for the hyperon eos is the same as that of the corresponding nuclear eos . in all cases in both panels of figure 7 ,",
    "we find that the central density increases gradually to several times the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "finally , there is a steep rise in the central density when the pns dynamically collapses into a black hole in milliseconds .",
    "it should be noted that the black hole formation time is different for different eos models .",
    "it is evident from the ccsn simulation of @xmath223wh07 that the black holes are formed at 1.511 and 1.623 s after the core bounce for the hs(dd2 ) and the hshen eos , respectively . for @xmath240wh07 ,",
    "the black hole formation time is 0.942 s in the case of the hs(dd2 ) eos , whereas it is 1.084 s for the hshen eos . for both supernova models and nuclear eos tables ,",
    "the black hole is formed earlier in case of the hs(dd2 ) than the situation with the hshen eos .",
    "the maximum gravitational ( baryonic ) pns masses are 2.464 ( 2.616 ) m@xmath3 and 2.459 ( 2.587 ) m@xmath3 for @xmath240sw07 with the hs(dd2 ) and the hshen eos , respectively .",
    "similarly , for @xmath223wh07 , those are 2.428 ( 2.605 ) m@xmath3 and 2.383 ( 2.512 ) m@xmath3 corresponding to the hs(dd2 ) and the hshen eos . on the other hand , the dynamical collapse to a black hole",
    "is accelerated for the hshen @xmath0 and bhb@xmath1 eos tables because hyperons make the eos softer .",
    "it is evident from figure 7 that the black hole formation time is shorter for hyperon eos than that for the corresponding nuclear eos .",
    "however , there is little difference between the black hole formation times corresponding to the hshen @xmath0 and bhb@xmath1 eoss .",
    "the results of ccsn simulations with other presupernova models are recorded in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the first column of the table lists the presupernova models of @xcite starting from @xmath220wh07 to @xmath240wh07 .",
    "two eos tables , such as the hshen @xmath0 and the bhb@xmath1 are adopted in these calculations . under each eos",
    ", the first column represents the black hole formation time ( @xmath19 ) estimated from the core bounce and the next column gives the maximum baryon mass ( m@xmath20 ) followed by the maximum gravitational mass ( m@xmath21 ) of the pns at the point of instability corresponding to the central value of the lapse function 0.3 .",
    "further investigations with the two @xmath0 hyperon eoss reveal an opposite behaviour of @xmath19 than what has been observed for nuclear eoss . for @xmath0 hyperon eos , @xmath19 for",
    "the bhb@xmath1 is always greater than that of the hshen @xmath0 for all presupernova models except @xmath240wh07 .",
    "the comparison of two hyperon eoss shows that the bhb@xmath6 is a stiffer eos than the hshen @xmath0 .",
    "the explanation of this behaviour may be traced back to the inclusion of repulsive @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction in the bhb@xmath1 eos .",
    "for all presupernova models and eoss adopted in simulations , it is evident from the table that the maximum gravitational mass of the pnss in each case is higher than their corresponding maximum cold neutron star masses .",
    "however , in some cases , the maximum gravitational mass of the pns collapsing into a black hole with the hshen @xmath0 eos is less than the two solar mass limit because the hshen @xmath0 eos does not result in a 2 m@xmath3 cold neutron star .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of the hshen @xmath0 eos , the difference between m@xmath21 of the pns and the maximum mass of the cold neutron star that includes @xmath0 hyperons ( 1.75 m@xmath3 ) is appreciable , whereas the maximum gravitational mass of the pns for the bhb@xmath1 eos is very similar to the value of the corresponding maximum mass of the cold neutron star with @xmath0s ( 2.1 m@xmath3 ) for the entire set of progenitor models .",
    "this shows that the thermal effects in the pns for the bhbh@xmath1 might not be as strong as in the pns with the hshen @xmath0 because the eos is stiffer in the former case .",
    "the role of decreasing thermal pressure with increasing stiffness of the eos was already noted by @xcite .",
    "this should have interesting implications for the study of the metastability of the pns with the bhb@xmath1 eos .",
    "we compare our findings with other ccsn simulations with hyperon eos .",
    "the ishizuka hyperon eos includes @xmath0 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 hyperons and is an extension of the hshen nuclear eos @xcite .",
    "the ccsn simulations were performed in a spherically symmetric general relativistic neutrino radiation hydrodynamics model using a 40 m@xmath3 progenitor of @xcite and the ishizuka hyperon eos @xcite . with the ls+@xmath0 eos",
    "@xcite peres et al .",
    "@xcite carried out a similar investigation using an @xmath240ww progenitor and a low metallicity 40 m@xmath3 progenitor of @xcite called @xmath2440 . @xcite",
    "also studied ccsn simulations using the hshen @xmath0 eos and progenitor models of @xcite , particularly studying the long duration evolution of the pns in the context of understanding the fate of the compact object in sn1987a .",
    "it should be noted that though our results with the bhb@xmath1 eos are qualitatively similar to those of earlier calculations , they are quantitatively different because only our @xmath0 hyperon eos is compatible with the 2 m@xmath3 limit of cold neutron stars",
    ". the early black hole formation due to softening in the @xmath0 hyperon eos compared with the nuclear eos is a robust conclusion in all of these calculations .",
    "total neutrino luminosity as well as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath25 luminosities as a function of postbounce time are plotted in figure 8 for the hs(dd2 ) ( left panel ) and the bhb@xmath1 ( right panel ) eos .",
    "the results are shown here for the @xmath240wh07 model .",
    "it should be noted that the neutrino emission ceases earlier for the bhb@xmath1 case than for the scenario with the hs(dd2 ) nuclear eos .",
    "a similar conclusion was arrived at in the simulation with other hyperon eoss @xcite .",
    "the shorter neutrino burst corresponding to the @xmath0 hyperon eos before the collapse of the pns into the black hole could be an important probe for the appearance of @xmath0 hyperons in the pns .",
    "this demands a more accurate treatment of neutrinos in the gr1d code .",
    "figure 9 exhibits the neutrino luminosities for both the @xmath0 hyperon eos and the @xmath240wh07 model .",
    "we find similar features for neutrino luminosities for both cases . though we are considering a phase transition from nuclear to @xmath0 hyperon matter , we do not find any evidence for a second neutrino burst , which was observed in a first order quark - hadron phase and was responsible for a successful supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "so far we have seen that simulations in the 1d ccsn model might lead to accretion driven black holes in failed supernovae .",
    "if a successful supernova occurs , can exotic matter such as hyperons make the pns metastable and drive it to become a low mass black hole during the long duration evolution when thermal support decreases and deleptonization takes place in the pns ? such a scenario was envisaged for the non - observation of a compact object in sn1987a @xcite .",
    "this problem was also studied in ccsn simulations @xcite .",
    "we continue our study by increasing the neutrino heating scale factor to @xmath26 1.5 for @xmath220wh07 with the bhb@xmath1 eos .",
    "the left panel of figure 10 exhibits the shock radius as a function of postbounce time . for the neutrino scale factor @xmath27 1 , it fails to launch a successful supernova explosion and the shock radius recedes .",
    "finally , the pns collapses into a black hole . for @xmath27 1.5",
    ", it is observed that the shock radius increases with time after a successful supernova explosion .",
    "the pns remains stable until 4 s. we do not find any onset of the metastability in the pns due to the loss of thermal support and neutrino pressure during the cooling phase over a few seconds .",
    "the window for the metastability is very narrow because the maximum pns mass in this case is 2.138 m@xmath3 whereas the maximum cold neutron star mass corresponding to the bhb@xmath1 eos is 2.1 m@xmath3 .",
    "the pns might evolve into a cold neutron star .",
    "gravitational masses of the pns for @xmath27 1 and 1.5 are shown as a function of postbounce time in the right panel of figure 10 .",
    "the pns cools down to a neutron star with a mass @xmath28 m@xmath3 at the end of 4 s.",
    "we have performed ccsn simulations using the bhb@xmath1 eos , which is compatible with a 2 m@xmath3 neutron star , and several progenitor models from the stellar studies of @xcite .",
    "it is observed that @xmath0s are produced a few hundred milliseconds after the core bounce .",
    "the appearance of @xmath0 hyperons is studied in great detail .",
    "it is evident from the density and temperature profiles as a function of radius that @xmath0s are produced in the core of the pns when the central density exceeds two times the normal nuclear matter density during the postbounce evolution phase . on the other hand ,",
    "an off - centre population of thermal @xmath0 hyperons is the result of peak values of temperature away from the centre of the pns .",
    "when we set the neutrino heating scale factor @xmath26 1 , each ccsn simulation ends with the formation of a black hole driven by mass accretion .",
    "it is interesting to find out that the black hole formation time for the bhb@xmath1 eos is shorter than that of the hshen @xmath0 eos though the opposite conclusion is drawn from the accretion driven black hole with the hshen nuclear and hs(dd2 ) eos models .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the repulsive @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction in the bhb@xmath1 eos makes it a stiffer eos than the hshen @xmath0 eos .",
    "neutrino luminosity is found to cease with the formation of a black hole earlier for the @xmath0 hyperon eos than for the corresponding case with the nuclear eos .",
    "we have studied the metastability of the pns due to the bhb@xmath1 eos in the long duration evolution after a successful supernova explosion using the @xmath220wh07 progenitor model with the increased neutrino heating scale factor of @xmath27 1.5 . in this case",
    ", we do not find any delayed collapse into the black hole due to the presence of @xmath0 hyperons in the pns .",
    "the pns that has a mass @xmath28 m@xmath3 remains stable until 4 s and might become a cold neutron star .    the numerical calculations presented in this article have been performed in the blade server of the astroparticle physics and cosmological division , saha institute of nuclear physics .",

    "<S> a comparative study of the @xmath0 hyperon equations of state of banik , hempel and banyopadhyay ( bhb ) @xcite and @xcite ( denoted as hshen @xmath0 ) for core collapse supernova ( ccsn ) simulations is carried out in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical evolution of a protoneutron star ( pns ) into a black hole is investigated in core collapse supernova simulations in the general relativistic one dimensional code using the bhb@xmath1 and hshen @xmath0 equation of state ( eos ) tables and different progenitor models from woosley and heger @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> radial profiles of the mass fractions of baryons , the density as well as the temperature in the pns at different moments in time , are compared for both eos tables . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the central density of the pns with time is demonstrated for those two @xmath0 hyperon eos tables and compared with their corresponding nuclear eos tables . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the black hole formation time is higher in the bhb@xmath1 case than in the hshen @xmath0 eos for the entire set of progenitor models adopted here , because the repulsive @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction makes the bhb@xmath1 eos stiffer . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino emission with the @xmath0 hyperon eos ceases earlier than that of its nuclear counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> the long duration evolution of the shock radius and gravitational mass of the pns after a successful supernova explosion with enhanced neutrino heating are studied with the bhb@xmath1 eos and @xmath220wh07 progenitor model . </S>",
    "<S> the pns is found to remain stable for 4 s and might evolve into a cold neutron star . </S>"
