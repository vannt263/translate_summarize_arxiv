    "because of their extremely short kelvin - helmholtz timescales , massive protostars above 8 @xmath3 begin burning h while still accreting and while still buried deep in their natal cloud cores . when the massive star reaches the main - sequence and ionizes its surroundings , it forms an ultracompact h  ii ( uchii ) region ( wood & churchwell 1989 ; churchwell 2002 ; hoare et al .  2007 ) , with typical sizes @xmath120.1  pc .",
    "precursors of uchii regions are thought to be dense hot molecular cores ( e.g. , kurtz et al .",
    "2000 ) , but early accretion phases are not as well understood as they are for low - mass stars . with spherical symmetry , radiation pressure on dust would lead to a limit at about 10  @xmath3 for the mass that could be accreted onto a star ( e.g. , wolfire & cassinelli 1987 ; kahn 1974 ; larson 1969 ) , or somewhat higher if momentum of infalling matter can overwhelm the dust sublimation radius . the way in which massive stars overcome this difficulty to reach @xmath840 - 150  @xmath3 is still a topic of current research .",
    "one proposed solution is geometric : in scaling up the traditional view of low - mass star formation that involves accretion disks and collimated outflows ( keto 2003 ; mckee & tan 2003 ) , a massive protostar may circumvent the radiation pressure problem with non - spherical geometry . with an optically thick disk and an optically thin bipolar flow",
    ", the disk can potentially shadow infalling material while radiative luminosity can , in principle , escape out the polar cavities without halting the accretion ( nakano 1989 ; jijina & adams 1996 ; yorke & sonnhalter 2002 ; krumholz et al .",
    "recent numerical simulations by krumholz et al .",
    "( 2009 ) argue that radiation pressure does not halt accretion , allowing the formation of very massive stars and multiple star systems from a common core .",
    "on the other hand , massive stars tend to form in dense clustered environments where the effects of their neighbors may influence the star formation process . in clustered environments ,",
    "coalescence of lower - mass protostars has been suggested as another way to get past the radiation - pressure limit ( e.g. , bonnell et al .",

    "it is not yet clear from observations if the geometry of a disk plus a bipolar cavity is associated with the formation of the most massive stars up to @xmath8150 @xmath3 ( figer 2005 ; kroupa 2005 ) , while fragmentation in massive disks may also interfere with forming the most massive stars by accretion ( kratter & matzner 2006 ; krumholz et al .",

    "its content of massive stars is similar to famous giant h  ii regions like 30 doradus , the carina nebula , and ngc  3603 , but it is younger , with most of its o - type stars still embedded deep in the molecular cloud .",
    "wood & churchwell ( 1989 ) noted several different morphological types of uchii regions : spherical / unresolved , cometary , shell , irregular or multiple - peaked , and bipolar ( added more recently in place of core / halo ) , all of which are seen in w49 ( de  pree et al .",
    "1997 , 2005 ) .",
    "this compact cluster of 4050 uchii regions in w49 introduced the uchii region `` lifetime problem '' because the sound crossing time of this region exceeds the expected duration of the free expansion phase for any single uchii region ( welch et al .",
    "( this synchronization may also imply that the burst of star formation was triggered by an external agent ; welch et al .",
    "a statistical expression of the uchii region lifetime problem is that the fraction of uchii regions compared to exposed o - type stars in the galaxy suggests that the uchii region lifetime is a significant fraction of the o star lifetime , and is therefore considerbly longer than the free expansion time of the h  ii region ( see wood & churchwell 1989 ) .",
    "note , however , that bourke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that some low - mass protostars may contaminate the wood & churchwell sample , so the implied lifetimes may be shorter ( see also hoare et al .",

    "about a dozen of these uchii regions are arranged in a remarkable 2  pc diameter ring at the center of w49 ( welch et al .",
    "1987 ) , and the origin of this ring remains unknown .",
    "the brightest member of the ring in the radio continuum is denoted source g , which breaks up into several components at sub - arcsecond resolution ( de pree et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "source g is also the brightest source in the ring in the thermal - infrared ( ir ) ( smith et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "source g is of particular interest because it harbors the most luminous h@xmath0o maser outflow known in the milky way ( gwinn , moran , & reid 1992 ) .",
    "the spatial confusion between radio continuum sources , h@xmath0o masers , and mid - ir emission has not been fully unraveled , however .",
    "this is , in fact , one of the main results of the present study : we identify the driving source of the h@xmath0o maser outflow by its thermal - ir emission from dust , and it is apparently _ not _ an ionized uchii region . on larger scales ,",
    "mid - ir emission is well - correlated with radio continuum emission from uchii regions in w49 ( smith et al .",
    "2000 ) and in other uchii regions ( e.g. , g29.96@xmath160.2 ; de buizer et al .  2002 ) , but this is generally not the case for h@xmath0o maser sources , which tend to have point - like ir emission but only weak or undetected radio emission ( tofani et al.1995 ) .",
    "high angular resolution is key , due to w49 s large distance from earth of 11.4 kpc .",
    "there have only been two previous mid - ir imaging studies of source g ( becklin et al .",
    "1973 ; smith et al.2000 ) , and one low - resolution mid - ir spectrum has been obtained ( gillet et al .",
    "none of these had sufficient angular resolution for meaningful comparison with the complex , multi - peaked radio continuum structure .",
    "the mid - ir imaging with the 8  m gemini observatory helps remedy this , with angular resolution comparable to that achieved toward w49 with the vla at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "we present our new mid - ir gemini images in  2 , including a discussion of how we spatially aligned the radio and ir data .",
    "then in  3 we discuss results for sources in the w49 ring other than source g , and in  4 we discuss source g in more detail , comparing our new gemini images to the radio continuum and maser emission .",
    "this allows us to construct a geometric working model for the complex source , and to model the ir emission in order to constrain the physical paramters of the embedded driving source . finally , in  5",
    "we discuss the significance of these observations of source g and corresponding implications for the process of massive star formation and feedback .",
    "we obtained thermal - ir images of w49a at wavelengths of 8.8 , 9.7 , 11.6 , and 18.5 @xmath17 m using michelle on the gemini north telescope .",

    "michelle is the facility mid - ir imager and spectrograph on gemini north , with a 320@xmath5240 pixel si : as ibc array , a pixel scale on the 8  m gemini north telescope of 0@xmath1099 , and a resulting field of view of 31@xmath17@xmath523@xmath18 .",
    "the observations were taken with a @xmath815  north - south chop throw .",
    "w49a is a complex , bright extended source , so some fainter emitting sources contaminated the reference sky positions , leading to negative image residuals in the chop - nod data .",
    "these artifacts were corrected as well as possible using the same technique that we used previously on a large mosaic of the bright inner regions of the orion nebula ( see smith et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "we subdivided the pixels without interpolation in each of the various images and then shifted and co - added them , to produce a final mosaic image at each of the four wavelengths we observed .",
    "the measured fwhm in our final registered and co - added 812 @xmath17 m images was 0@xmath130@xmath135 , and about 50% larger at 18.5 @xmath17 m , roughly consistent with the expected diffraction limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] shows the resulting co - added michelle images .",
    "the observations were performed in service mode and targeted the water maser source w49a / g , but the @xmath830@xmath520field - of - view included a few other sources in the brightest central and western parts of the ring of uchii regions as well ( welch et al.1987 ) .",
    "the observing conditions were not optimal ; while the image quality was good , the sky was non - photometric , and suitable standard star observations were not obtained .",
    "the mid - ir images presented here could therefore not be absolutely flux calibrated and our discussion must be limited mainly to the observed morphology . our previous ground - based observations , however , have already measured the mid - ir fluxes of various sources in our field ( smith et al .",
    "2000 ) , and we incorporate these and other available photometric data in our models described in  4.4 . in principle , the bandpasses of the 8.8 and 11.6 @xmath17 m filters allow for partial contribution of pah ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ) features . however , a low - resolution 813 @xmath17 m spectrum of source g published by gillet et al .",
    "( 1975 ) shows only smooth continuum emission with deep 9.7  @xmath17 m silicate absorption , so we suspect that our images are not strongly influenced by extended pah emission .",

    ".      figures  [ fig : outflow]@xmath20 and [ fig : outflow]@xmath21 compare the 3.6  cm radio continuum morphology to that seen in our 11.6 and 18.5  @xmath17 m gemini images . clearly , the large - scale radio continuum is more elongated east / west , while the diffuse ir emission at 18.5  @xmath17 m seems to be elongated in the opposite direction .",
    "the wings of the x - shaped ir nebulosity that emerge to the ne and se from g : irs1 seem to outline the brightest diffuse radio continuum emission in the eastern part of g ( sources g3 and g4 ) .",
    "it seems likely that the mid - ir emission comes from warm dust at the limb - brightened boundary of an ionized cavity ; our model images discussed in the next section show that this interpretation is plausible .",
    "the large cavity is likely to be a stellar wind - blown bubble ( e.g. , weaver et al .  1977 ) , since it is partly filled with x - ray emission .",
    "the approximate center of the extended x - ray sources detected by tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which has a similar extent to the radio emission , is marked by the `` x '' in figures [ fig : outflow]@xmath20 and [ fig : outflow]@xmath21 . in that case , the hard x - rays are likely to be the hot stellar wind or jet decelerated in the reverse shock ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , for example ) .",
    "a similar geometry may apply to the western lobe of source g , where source b1 and other low - level diffuse radio emission may define a similar  but smaller  ionized cavity on the opposite side , which is bounded close to the source by the fainter ir extensions to the sw and nw from g : irs1 .",
    "the western side of the putative bipolar outflow is more complicated , because there are other uchii regions ( sources b , d , and e ) projected along the same line of sight to the redshifted lobe , and because the diffuse radio emission from the redshifted lobe is fainter .",
    "we are therefore less confident about the receding lobe s geometry , although its smaller size makes intuitive physical sense if its environment is denser .",
    "a basic geometric model is sketched in figure [ fig : outflow]@xmath22 .",
    "tilting the eastern ( left in fig .  [ fig : outflow]@xmath22 ) cavity toward the observer is favored by several observational properties : 1 ) the eastern lobe is brighter , 2 ) the uchii regions to the west are all obscured in the mid - ir ( smith et al .",
    "2000 ) , 3 ) the morphology of g : irs1 is consistent with the eastern polar axis being tilted toward us , and 4 ) this is the orientation of the @xmath825 km s@xmath10 co outflow observed on similar size scales by scoville et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , where the blueshifted co emission is toward the east and the redshifted co emission is offset to the west .",
    "the co outflow probably traces a dense sheath or cocoon surrounding the ionized cavity .",
    "this orientation for the co outflow and ionized cavities is orthogonal to the water maser outflow ( the small white arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : outflow]@xmath22 ) .",
    "one solution to this discrepancy , as noted above , may be that the water masers trace dense material in an equatorial torus or envelope , or may originate at the interface between the cavity and disk envelope close to the source ( mac low et al .",
    "a similar orientation is seen in the omc-1 core ( e.g. , plambeck et al .",
    "1982 ; greenhill et al .  1998 ) , and also for s140 irs1 ( hoare 2006 ) .    from figure",
    "[ fig : outflow]@xmath22 it is easy to picture how the linear water maser feature located 0@xmath11 west of g : irs1 could arise near the tangent point of the blueshifted outflow cavity . the overall outflow geometry for source g that is pictured in figure  [ fig : outflow]@xmath22 is nearly identical to that envisioned earlier by dickel & goss ( 1990 ) , although their picture was based primarily on the different column densities observed toward various lines of sight .",
    "in fact , dickel & goss argued that because of an abrupt change in column density , the edge of the blueshifted part of the outflow must reside between sources g and d , as we have pictured here and have associated with the linear water maser feature .",
    "irs1 is not concident with the ionized uchii regions g2a , g2b , or g1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) , showing that there are several centers of massive star formation activity even on size scales of @xmath80.1 pc .",
    "thus , in priciple , we do not necessarily need the water maser outflow to be aligned with the larger cavity because it could simply be due to a different outflow with a different axis orientation .",
    "for example , in omc-1 , the large - scale molecular outflow and cavity traced by mid - ir emission and the shocked h@xmath0 emission from the system of `` fingers '' defines one axis that runs se to nw ( allen & burton 1993 ; kaifu et al .",
    "2000 ; kwan & scoville 1976 ; gezari et al .  1998 ; shuping et al .  2003 ; smith et al .",
    "2005 ) , while source irc2 seems to drive a smaller collimated outflow nearly perpendicular to the large scale flow ( greenhill et al .  1998 , 2003",
    "; bally et al .  2005 ) .",
    "the omc-1 south core has several jets and molecular outflows in various directions that all originate in a @xmath80.01 pc region with multiple mid - ir sources ( smith et al .  2004 ;",
    "zapata et al .",
    "2004 ) .      in order to verify that the morphology and orientation of the bipolar cavity are generally correct as sketched in figure  [ fig : outflow]@xmath22 , and to constrain physical properties of the illuminating source , we conducted simulations of the dust emission to compare with the observed mid - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and with the morphology observed in our new mid - ir images . as a starting point , we fit the sed of w49/g using the robitaille et al.(2006 , 2007 ) grid of young stellar object ( yso ) models and the online sed fitter . to construct the mid - ir seds",
    "shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] , we used the 813 @xmath17 m spectrum from gillet et al .",
    "( 1975 ) , combined with ground - based photometry of source g from smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) at 12.3 , 12.8 , and 20.6 @xmath17 m , and photometry obtained at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8 @xmath17 m with the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _ as part of the glimpse survey ( benjamin et al .",
    "( these additional data were necessary , as our gemini data did not have reliable photometric calibration stars , as noted earlier . )",
    "the ground - based spectral data at 10  @xmath17 m had a large beam ( 22 ) compared to the photometric data ( @xmath82  at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 4  at 12.3 , 12.8 , 20.6 ) , so we scaled the flux in the spectrum to match the imaging photometry .",
    "it is therefore possible that the silicate absorption feature at 10 @xmath17 m is partially filled - in by silicate emission from the surrounding heated nebula .",
    "our gemini images at 9.7 and 18.5  @xmath17 m in figure  [ fig : one ] do show a halo that is more extended than at 11.6  @xmath17 m ( see also figs .",
    "[ fig : three ] and [ fig : four ] ) , so extended silicate emission may contaminate the larger beam used by gillet et al .",
    "( 1975 ) .    with this possible contamination in mind ,",

    "note that the accretion rate is a model parameter prescribing the envelope density and mass , and is not a direct measure of the true accretion rate .",
    "these well - fit sed models ( defined as having @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 value of the best fit ) have viewing angles of 85 , and bipolar cavity opening angles of 11 - 18 .",
    "fits that allow the silicate absorption feature to be deeper than indicated by the gillet et al.(1975 ) spectral data ( model b in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) , on the other hand , give similar stellar properties ( a central stellar source of mass 2535 @xmath3 , and luminosity 23@xmath510@xmath6 @xmath15 ) , an envelope accretion rate @xmath28 5@xmath510@xmath24 @xmath3 yr@xmath10 , no disk , viewing angles of 3090 degrees , and very narrow bipolar cavities ( 23 ) .",
    "this second group of model seds has deeper silicate absorption than the gillet et al .",
    "( 1975 ) spectrum , consistent with the extended silicate emission mentioned above . however , the very narrow opening angle is in conflict with the observed mid - ir morphology .",
    "our high - resolution mid - ir images in figure  [ fig : one ] indicate a relatively large bipolar cavity opening angle ( @xmath830 ) , and the radio continuum , co , and water maser data argue for a viewing angle tilted from edge - on (  4.3 ) .",
    "therefore , we modified the model parameters accordingly in order to fit both the seds and structures in gemini images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] ) with a viewing angle of @xmath860 .",
    "the significantly different result with model c highlights the value of simultaneously fitting both the sed and the spatially resolved morphology .",

    "[ fig : sed ] ) , and the model images at 11.6 and 18.5 @xmath17 m are compared to the observed gemini data in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the qualitative agreement is quite good , especially in the cometary - shaped core .",
    "note that this model did not account for the density gradient in the background cloud that was discussed in  4.1 and  4.3 , so the environment - dependent asymmetry in the large bipolar cavity ( see figure  [ fig : outflow ] ) is not addressed by these models .",
    "model c required a more massive star with a stellar mass of @xmath845 @xmath3 , luminosity @xmath83@xmath510@xmath6 @xmath15 , an equivalent envelope accretion rate @xmath29@xmath3010@xmath9 @xmath3 yr@xmath10 , and a large inner hole of 1700 au ( 0@xmath115 ; still unresolved in our images ) , which is larger than the expected dust sublimation radius .",
    "the more massive star in model c has a hotter effective temperature and this fits the steeply rising 110 @xmath17 m spectrum better ( see whitney et al .",
    "2004 ) , as does the large inner hole . also , the hotter and more massive star is in better agreement with the star that is needed to provide the ionizing photon flux of source g : de  pree et al .",
    "( 1997 ) estimated a source with and equivalent luminosity and ionizing flux of an o4 v type star to account for the observed radio continuum emission .",
    "however , models of the infalling envelope include a parameter , @xmath31 , which is the centrifugal radius inside of which a disk would form .",
    "the sed is well fit with @xmath325001000 au , consistent with possible disk formation .",
    "the proper interpretation of the inner disk hole suggested by the model fits , within a radius of @xmath81700 au , is unclear because of the uncertainty in fitting a steep sed at short wavelengths in a source with high extinction .",
    "we regard this inner hole as tentative and in need of confirmation , but we discuss it as a possibility in the following section .",
    "the high angular resolution of our new mid - ir images obtained with michelle on gemini south reveal the extended ir morphology of source g , and show that the concentrated peak of source g : irs1 is coincident with a hot molecular core and the origin point of the powerful h@xmath0o maser in w49 .",

    "although this association with the water maser was suspected when the ir source was first discovered by becklin et al .",
    "( 1973 ) , their measurements were made using a single element detector with a 7  diameter aperture , leaving much room for ambiguity given the complex structure of source g. our images show that several other faint sources would have contaminated that aperture as well .",

    "the peak of the mid - ir 8 - 20 @xmath17 m emission is _ not _ coincident with any strong compact radio continuum source . although irs1 is surrounded by more diffuse radio continuum emission from source g on large scales ( several times larger than the whole maser outflow ) , the closest peak of compact radio continuum emission that signifies an uchii region is source g2a / b , which is offset more than 0@xmath135 or @xmath84,000 au to the north .",
    "this is beyond our estimated positional uncertainty .",
    "our finding that the compact source g : irs1 is coincident with the origin of the water masers and not radio source g2a / b supports the emerging view ( de buizer et al .",
    "2005 ; tofani et al .",
    "1995 ) that maser sources tend to be associated with mid - ir emission rather than radio continuum emission from uchii regions .",
    "the peak of the mid - ir 8 - 20 @xmath17 m emission is coincident with a hot molecular core revealed by tracers such as ch@xmath34cn , seen in the high resolution mm - wavelength maps made by wilner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "this hot core in source g also shows signs of accretion through inverse p cygni absorption profiles in cs ( williams et al .",
    "this accretion signature in the hot core is consistent with the high effective envelope accretion rate in our model fits to the ir sed ( about 10@xmath9 @xmath3 yr@xmath10 ) .",
    "the morphology of source g : irs1 suggests strongly that it is associated with not only the maser outflow , but a much larger bipolar outflow and cavity traced by co emission ( scoville et al .",
    "1986 ) , radio continuum , and x - ray emission .",
    "while the inner source itself shows no compact radio continum emission , diffuse radio continuum emission is present on large scales from the bipolar cavity , implying that some lyman continuum radiation escapes out the poles .",
    "the large scale co outflow and the h@xmath0o maser outflow appear to be orthogonal .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission partly fills the interior cavity of the eastern lobe ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "2006 ) , perhaps marking a reverse shock in the polar outflow .",
    "this combination of observed properties  a strong mid - ir source associated with a hot molecular core and maser emission , but not strong radio continuum  is quite similar to the hot core in orion that powers the extended bn / kl bipolar molecular outflow .",
    "even the apparent geometry is similar , with the water maser outflow oriented orthogonal to the larger wide - angle bipolar molecular outflow in both cases .",
    "thus , in many ways , source g in w49 appears to be a more luminous analog of the omc-1 outflow , and may provide critical insight to the formation of very massive stars . however , there is also an important difference between these outflows : unlike orion , at least one of w49a / g s outflow cavities is filled with ionized gas seen in the radio continuum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : outflow ] ) , and appears to have diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "these ionized cavities span a region roughly 8  or almost 0.5 pc across , larger than the bn / kl outflow .",
    "the ionizing flux to sustain source g that was deduced by de  pree et al.(1997 ) requires the equivalent of at least six o6-type stars or a single o4 star .",
    "thus , perhaps source g is simply in a somewhat more evolved wind - blown cavity stage than bn / kl , more akin to the bipolar h  ii region s106 ( bally et al .  1998 ; smith et al .",
    "interestingly , in the case of s  106 , the smaller of the two bipolar lobes is also more deeply embedded in the parent cloud .",
    "normally , these observations of g : irs1 as a traditional hot molecular core that is still in a stage of active envelope accretion would seem to be at odds with its much larger cavity filled with radio continuum emission and x - ray emission , because one does not expect a hot core to produce significant ionizing flux . the high envelope accretion rate of 10@xmath9 @xmath3 yr@xmath10 that we infer from models of the ir emission would be sufficient to quench the ionizing flux if the source were spherical . one might naturally ask _ what ionizes the gas in the large outflow cavity ? _ we note two possible interpretations that have different implications",
    ".    given its bipolar geometry , g : irs1 itself may be the source of ionization for the outflow despite its high envelope accretion rate . as noted earlier , the equivalent ionizing flux of an o4 star needed to account for the radio continuum emission is in good agreement with the massive ( @xmath845 @xmath3 ) and luminous ( @xmath83@xmath510@xmath6 @xmath15 ) star that we infer from models of the ir emission . even though it is a strong mid - ir source inside a hot molecular core",
    ", the embedded massive star may have become hot enough to generate a large uv luminosity that may be able to escape through lower density regions in the polar directions .",
    "our model fits to the sed favor a relatively hot star . the required lyman continuum flux passing through a small polar `` nozzle '' would exceed the dust eddington limit ( radiation force on dust grains ) , but that is part of the basic notion behind using geometry to allow massive stars to form ( e.g. , tan & mckee 2004 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that stellar radiation alone could have been the agent responsible for driving the powerful outflow observed in source g. from observations of the co outflow , scoville et al .",
    "( 1986 ) derive an outflow mass of 138 @xmath3 and a momentum of 3500 @xmath3 km s@xmath10 .",
    "located within @xmath354  of the central star , the outflow dynamical timescale for an average @xmath825 km s@xmath10 outflow speed is roughly 10@xmath11 yr . the momentum supplied by the stellar radiation field , @xmath36 , during this time falls short by a factor of @xmath850 if the stellar luminosity has been constant at the value of 3@xmath510@xmath6 @xmath15 that we infer from radiative transfer models .",
    "similarly , the mass - loss rate required for the mechanical energy of a stellar wind to power the outflow over the same time period , assuming a typical o - star wind speed of 1500 km s@xmath10 , would need to be roughly 2@xmath510@xmath24 @xmath3 yr@xmath10 .",
    "this is @xmath8100 times higher than typical main - sequence o star mass - loss rates in the relevant luminosity range ( see repolust et al.2004 ; smith 2006 ) .",
    "however , such a high mass - loss rate is still only 20% of the effective envelope accretion rate that we infer from models .",
    "therefore , the likely conclusion is that the large - scale co outflow in w49a / g was in fact driven by accretion , at least until very recently , and that the central star in source g is therefore an example of a massive star of @xmath845 @xmath3 that is forming by accretion from a disk .",
    "our models imply that the inner disk has been cleared out to radii of 10002000 au , but this depends on the short - wavelength tail of the ir sed that is also severly affected by extinction , so we regard this result with some caution .",
    "if true , this must have occured recently compared to the @xmath810@xmath11 yr age of the large co outflow .",
    "the h@xmath0o maser outflow , on the other hand , is distributed over a smaller @xmath81  ( 0.06 pc ) region with speeds up to @xmath8100 km s@xmath10 , implying a dynamical age of only @xmath8500 yr .",
    "this interpretation of w49/g directly supports the picture of single massive star formation by accretion advocated by yorke & sonnhalter ( 2002 ) , krumholz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and others .",
    "indeed , nearly all the physical parameters we infer for the central star and outflow of source g : irs1 ( the stellar mass and luminosity , the bipolar cavity opening angle , the envelope accretion rate , etc . )",
    "are closely matched in the numerical simulation studied by krumholz et al .",
    "source g : irs1 may be an excellent observational test case for developing models of massive star formation that include the disruptive effects of radiative feedback and stellar winds ( e.g. , krumholz et al .  2005 , 2009 ) . in this context ,",
    "future observations of this source with facilities such as _ alma _ may be of great interest in order to confirm the tentative inner disk hole that we infer .",
    "on the other hand , g : irs1 is in a crowded and observationally complex environment , leaving room for other possibilities .",
    "a second conceivable interpretation is that the outflow cavity from source g is actually ionized by neighboring o stars that already formed within the same cloud core .",
    "the best candidate for this type of symbiotic relationship is the nearby source g2a / b , located just a few thousand au to the north in projection ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "g2a / b appears to be a small bipolar uchii region where the putative polar axis is aligned with that of g : irs1 and its large - scale outflow .",
    "this alignment makes it seem plausible that uv radiation generated by the o star in g2a / b could escape out the poles to ionize the environment of source g seen in diffuse radio continuum emission .",
    "this interpretation highlights the degree to which dense clustered environments are important in massive star formation where feedback from neighboring massive stars may join forces in disrupting their common natal environment .    in any case ,",
    "g : irs1 may trace a brief but critical phase in massive star formation , akin to that of the bn / kl outflow in orion .",
    "returning to the uchii region lifetime problem mentioned earlier , we note that among the 4050 uchii regions in w49a , g : irs1 is the only water maser outflow source and large - scale bipolar outflow .",
    "( source a , undetected in the ir , appears to be a fledgeling bipolar cavity and circumstellar torus or disk ; de  pree et al .",
    "1997 , 2004 . )",
    "if the uchii region lifetime really is of order 10@xmath6 yr , then it is likely that the maser outflow phase exemplified by source g is transient , lasting no longer than a few thousand years .",
    "this is comparable to the dynamical timescale of the observed outflow in source g with a characteristic size scale of a few arcseconds and the fastest expansion speeds of @xmath8100 km s@xmath10 in the h@xmath0o maser outflow .",
    "similarly , 5001000 yr is the dynamical timescale of the related outflow in the omc-1 core ( e.g. , odell et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "this returns our attention to the significance of the possible inner disk hole existing simultaneously with the bipolar outflow .",
    "namely , the short timescale involved suggests that this inner disk is being cleared away at the same time that the h@xmath0o maser outflow is driven .",
    "although direct radiative or stellar wind feedback from the central star has too little momentum to have powered the large scale co outflow over the past 10@xmath11 yr , it may drive the much younger maser outflow .",
    "however , we caution that we only infer the inner disk hole from the absence of short - wavelength ir emission , so it would be interesting if future high - resolution techniques could directly resolve this putative inner disk hole , to catch g : irs1 in the act of destroying its own accretion disk and thereby fixing the central star s final mass .",
