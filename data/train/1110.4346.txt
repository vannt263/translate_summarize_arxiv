    "more recently , normalized nash modification has appeared in the work of atanasov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it has been recently shown by gonzlez perez and teissier in ( @xcite ) , and by grigoriev and milman in ( @xcite ) , that for the case of ( not necessarily normal ) toric varieties of any dimension , the iteration of nash modification can be translated into a purely combinatorial algorithm .    here",
    "we follow the results proved in @xcite .",

    "then it is proved in @xcite ( section 4 ) that , if @xmath22 , the affine charts of nash modification of @xmath10 are given by the toric surfaces associated to the sets @xmath20 such that @xmath23 .",
    "the iteration of this algorithm gives rise to a tree in which every branch corresponds to the choices of @xmath23 .",
    "a branch of the algorithm ends if the semigroup @xmath24 is generated by two elements .",
    "we will prove the following result : fix @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( we allow @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , such that @xmath33 . let @xmath34 , @xmath35 be two elements such that @xmath36 for all @xmath37 , @xmath38 for all @xmath37 such that @xmath39 and such that @xmath23 .",

    "we will prove that the iteration of the algorithm stops for all the possible choices of @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , we give a bound ( that depends on @xmath40 ) on the number of steps required for the algorithm to stop .",
    "of course , this result gives only some progress towards the question of whether or not nash modification resolves singularities of toric surfaces .",
    "our result has the following interpretation in terms of valuations .",
    "let @xmath10 be the affine toric surface determined by @xmath42 and let @xmath0 be its field of rational functions .",
    "let @xmath1 be any valuation centered on @xmath10 such that @xmath2 for all @xmath3 .",
    "we will see in section 5 that these valuations determine linear transformations @xmath40 as above and such that the center of @xmath4 after successive nash modifications belongs to one of the charts chosen by @xmath40 . by the result ,",
    "the branches determined by @xmath40 are finite and they end in a non - singular surface .",
    "this implies the following theorem :    let @xmath1 be any valuation centered on @xmath10 such that @xmath2 for all @xmath3 .",
    "then a finite iteration of nash modification gives local uniformization along @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , the problem of local uniformization of toric surfaces by iterating nash modification remains open only for the valuations @xmath4 of real rank 1 and rational rank 2 , such that there exists @xmath3 such that @xmath43 .",
