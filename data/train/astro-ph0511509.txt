    "over the last two decades , quasar ( qso ) absorption line systems have provided tremendous insight into the nature of proto - galaxies at high redshift . of particular interest",
    "are the damped lyman @xmath0 systems ( dlas ) defined to have n(hi ) @xmath7 atoms @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "systems with such large column densities can provide self - shielding from the ambient ionizing radiation at high redshift and protect large reservoirs of neutral gas .",
    "such systems are prime sites for star formation .",
    "moderate and high - resolution databases @xcite and numerous spectroscopic studies of dlas have given us a detailed view of the chemical abundances and gas kinematics of proto - galaxies , yet , except for two confirmed @xmath4 detections of dla emission @xcite , information regarding their mass , luminosity , and morphology has remained elusive .",
    "one approach to measure the average mass of a galaxy population at high redshift is under the implicit assumption that galaxies are a result of the gravitational instabilities of primordial density fluctuations .",
    "cdm hierarchical models predict that the most massive galaxies at high redshift preferentially form clustered together near the density peaks of regions with an underlying mass overdensity , whereas low - mass galaxies form more uniformly throughout space @xcite .",
    "the factor in which the underlying dark matter is enhanced in the regions where galaxies cluster as compared to that implied by the galaxies themselves is referred to as bias . in this context",
    ", the spatial distribution of a population of galaxies provides a means to infer their typical dark matter halo mass .",
    "this method has been used to infer the average mass of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath2 @xcite and agrees with the mass estimates from nebular line - width measurements @xcite and those implied by star formation model fits @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to measure the mass of dlas by their spatial clustering because of the sparse distribution of bright qso sightlines and since only approximately one quarter of all @xmath9 qsos exhibit dla absorption .",
    "however , the mass of dlas can be inferred by their cross - correlation with another known population @xcite .",
    "since the lbg auto - correlation function and lbg galaxy bias at @xmath2 has been established @xcite , it is natural to use these galaxies as tracers of the underlying mass distribution to cross - correlate with @xmath2 dlas . with this in mind , a03 used the spectroscopic sample of @xcite to test the spatial distribution of lbgs and dlas .",
    "a count of the number of lbgs in three - dimensional cells centered on the four dlas in their sample showed no significant overdensity .",
    "in contrast , @xcite used photometric redshifts to measure the clustering of lbgs near two dlas and one sub - dla in wide - field images . from monte carlo simulations , they found a non - zero dla - lbg clustering amplitude to greater than @xmath10 and angular analysis on scales out to @xmath11mpc estimated the dla - lbg cross - correlation to be equal to , or greater than , the lbg auto - correlation .",
    "both analyses had limited statistics and could neither confirm , nor rule out , a significant overdensity of lbgs near dlas .    in this letter , we highlight the results of a spectroscopic survey for lbgs associated with 11 dlas at @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce strong evidence for an overdensity of lbgs near dlas and present the first detection of the three - dimensional dla - lbg cross - correlation function .",
    "a more complete discussion of the dla - lbg cross - correlation analysis is presented in @xcite along with our independent measurement of the @xmath2 lbg auto - correlation function . in this letter , we adopt @xmath12 cosmology .",
    "we acquired deep @xmath1bvri images from 2000 april through 2003 november of nine qso fields with 11 known dlas @xmath13 using the carnegie observatories spectrograph and multi - object imaging camera @xcite on the @xmath14 hale telescope at palomar and the low resolution imager and spectrometer @xcite on the keck i telescope .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard manner .",
    "we developed a @xmath1bvri photometric selection technique for lbgs at @xmath2 that proved comparable to previous techniques in both efficiency and resulting redshift distribution .",
    "over the 465 arcmin@xmath15 surveyed , we found 796 r @xmath3 objects that met our color criteria .",
    "follow - up multi - object spectroscopy of 529 lbg candidates using lris yielded 339 redshifts .",
    "we identified 211 lbgs with @xmath4 and used these in the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "details of data acquisition , reduction , and analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "as a coarse measure of the distribution of lbgs near dlas , we divided our survey volume into cells with dimensions of the field area of lris at @xmath2 ( @xmath16mpc ) and @xmath17mpc ) .",
    "the choice in cell size follows that of @xcite and includes the majority of the objects associated with a central object having a galaxy bias less than or equal to the lbg bias at @xmath2 . the extended length in the redshift direction is intended to account for the @xmath18mpc error in the systemic redshift measurement inherent to lbgs .",
    "this simple counts - in - cells analysis found an average of 1.27 objects residing in cells centered on each of the 11 dlas where an average of 0.85 objects should have been found randomly .",
    "random values were determined for objects in identical cells at the redshifts of the dlas pulled from normalized random catalogs that mimicked the constraints of the data and were corrected by the photometric selection function [ see @xcite ] .",
    "this observed overdensity can be compared to an average of 1.16 objects found in cells of identical size centered on lbgs in our survey having similar redshifts to the dlas but located in other fields .",
    "interestingly , two of the 14 objects associated with the dlas are qsos .",
    "since qsos are believed to form in massive dark matter halos that seed supermassive black holes , this suggests that the corresponding dlas reside in overdense regions .",
    "we measured the dla - lbg cross - correlation function @xmath19 using the usual approach of comparing galaxy pair separations in the data to galaxy pair separations in the random galaxy catalogs .",
    "we used the estimator of @xcite to measure the excess probability over random of finding an lbg at a distance @xmath20 from a dla @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the catalog of data - data pair separations , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the data - random and random - data pair separation cross - reference catalogs , and @xmath25 is the catalog of random - random pair separations .",
    "this estimator is well - suited for small galaxy samples and has a nearly poisson variance .",
    "the random catalogs were constructed to be many times larger than the data catalog to reduce shot noise and were then normalized to the data .",
    "the mean lbg density was determined from the data in all 11 fields .",
    "we determined @xmath26 by counting the number of pairs in each catalog over a series of log or linear intervals ( i.e. bins ) .",
    "in addition , we made the assumption that @xmath26 follows a power law of the form @xmath27      we initially measured the cross - correlation function by duplicating the cylindrical binning technique described in a03 , appendix c. this technique was adopted to help minimize the effect that lbg redshift uncertainties have on the clustering signal as compared to traditional radial bins .",
    "in addition , this approach permitted a direct comparison of our results to the published lbg auto - correlation values of a03 using the available online dataset of @xcite since both surveys were executed in a similar manner and used the same instruments and configurations .    in this treatment",
    ", the expected projected angular overdensity is defined to be @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the greater of 1000 km sec@xmath30 and @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the beta and incomplete beta functions with @xmath34 @xcite . applying this method to the dla - lbg cross - correlation",
    ", we found best fit parameter values and 1 sigma uncertainties of @xmath35mpc,@xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig : omegap ] presents and compares these results with the lbg auto - correlation results of a03 and is plotted in a consistent manner where @xmath37 as described above .",
    "the errors on the cross - correlation values shown in the figure are those determined using the formulation in @xcite and the reported errors on the functional fit were determined by duplicating the monte carlo error analysis as described in a03 .",
    "the latter error analysis may underestimate the true error by a factor of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "although the uncertainties are large , it is immediately apparent from figure  [ fig : omegap ] that the form and central values of the two correlation functions are similar .",
    "in addition , we computed a cross - correlation length of @xmath39mpc for a fixed value of @xmath6 , equivalent to the value reported in a03 and @xcite for the lbg auto - correlation . our decision to center the dlas in the observed fields prevented an estimation of the dla - lbg cross - correlation effectively beyond @xmath40mpc using the above method . however , our cross - correlation values are consistent with the constraints placed on the dla - lbg cross - correlation by @xcite using a comparable analysis over a range of @xmath41mpc .",
    "as an independent method of analysis , and to make the most of our dataset , we determined the maximum likelihood of a power law fit ( equation  [ powerlaw ] ) to the observed data @xcite .",
    "we divided the radial separations into a large number of finely spaced regular intervals that coincided with either 1 or 0 lbgs .",
    "poisson statistics hold in the regime of large interval number and small probability per interval .",
    "we used this to form the likelihood function @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the expected number of pairs in the @xmath44th interval , @xmath45 is the observed number of pairs for that same interval , and the index @xmath46 runs over the elements where there are no pairs .",
    "the expected number of pairs was determined by solving equation  [ dlaest ] for @xmath22 over a reasonable range of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we then maximized the expression @xmath49 .",
    "confidence levels were defined as @xmath50 with the assumption that @xmath51 has a @xmath52 distribution .",
    "we found the best fit values and 68% confidence levels for the cross - correlation using this method to be @xmath53mpc,@xmath54 and a best fit value of @xmath5mpc for a fixed @xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ml ] displays these results",
    ".    @xcite describe the above analyses in more detail , present several tests to address the shortcomings of each method , and make efforts to quantify the physical effects that the multi - object slitmasks have on the clustering signal .",
    "a short summary of best fit values and @xmath55 uncertainties described here and from that work is listed in table  [ table : dlresults ] .",
    "it can be seen that all independent methods , and tests thereof , result in consistent central values within their uncertainties .",
    "the lbg bias at @xmath2 , derived from the lbg auto - correlation of the r @xmath3 spectroscopic sample , indicates an average lbg dark matter halo mass of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the 11 dlas presented here comprise an unbiased representation of a random cross - section weighted sample .",
    "the similarity between the lbg auto - correlation and the dla - lbg cross - correlation implies that the bias factors of the two populations are comparable and that dlas , on average , may form in similarly massive potential wells .",
    "we consider the implications from the best fit central value @xmath57 using the maximum likelihood method with fixed @xmath6 .",
    "this measurement corresponds to a dla galaxy bias of @xmath58 and represents an average dla halo mass of @xmath59 .",
    "this value is higher than what is predicted for dlas by simple models @xcite but is in very good agreement with numerical models of varying resolution that invoke strong galactic - scale winds @xcite and thermal feedback @xcite . in these models ,",
    "galactic outflows purge low - mass halos of gas capable of generating damped lyman @xmath0 absorption lines and result in a higher mean mass .",
    "it must be noted that because cdm predicts a steeply rising mass function , it is expected that the median dla halo mass is lower than the mean mass implied here .",
    "the observed similarity in the spatial distributions of dlas and lbgs also helps support previous ideas that the two populations may be connected @xcite .",
    "recent analysis of the _ hubble ultra deep field _",
    "@xcite shows little evidence for _ in situ _ star formation throughout the dla neutral gas .",
    "however , calculations using the cii * absorption feature to trace the cooling rates in dlas @xcite require local sources of radiation to heat dlas .",
    "a plausible scenario is that lbgs are embedded in the same systems that contain dlas .",
    "this model is reinforced by the near equality between dla cooling rates and lbg heating rates .",
    "furthermore , the lack of detected dla emission out to reasonable impact parameters from background qsos and the above implied average halo mass are consistent with dlas sampling the bulk of the lbg population with typical impact parameters of @xmath60 and median luminosities of r @xmath61 .",
    "although the uncertainties in this initial measure of the three - dimensional dla - lbg cross - correlation function are large , there remains strong evidence for an overdensity of lbgs near dlas .",
    "the similarity in the central values between the dla - lbg cross - correlation and the lbg auto - correlation underscore a need for additional observations to improve the statistical significance of these results and to provide a step toward a complete picture of galaxy formation and evolution .",
