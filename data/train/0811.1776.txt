    "unified schemes rely on different lines of sight toward the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) to explain a variety of different species of apparently distinct astrophysical phenomena ( e.g. antonucci et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "these unified schemes invoke the putative dusty torus around the central accreting supermassive black hole which obscures the central nuclear source and the high - velocity gas which lies close to the nucleus , i.e. the broad - line region . although slight modifications to this simple scheme may be needed ( e.g. lawrence 1991 ; simpson 2005 ) the general picture remains the same .",
    "the evidence for this orientation - based unified scheme is now compelling , including the properties of the unresolved hard x - ray background for example which suggests the existence of a large number of obscured qsos ( e.g. gilli et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the dusty torus is thought to obscure the central engine along certain lines of sight , resulting in the nuclear source appearing faint at optical wavelengths with the emission dominated by the host galaxy s stellar population .",
    "galaxies whose properties and orientation causes us to observe them in this manner are known as obscured ( or type-2 ) qsos .",
    "further evidence of these obscured sources comes from radio surveys , where large - scale radio jets provide a method of finding both obscured and unobscured agn without the problems associated with dust obscuration .",
    "these studies have shown that the fraction of obscured ( type-2 ) radio - loud agn may be as high as 60 per cent , with the unobscured ( type-1 ) qsos traditionally found in optical surveys only comprising 40 per cent of the powerful agn population ( e.g. willott et al . 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , it would be reasonable to assume that a similar fraction of radio - quiet obscured sources should also exist .",
    "however , such obscured sources have proven very difficult to find with traditional techniques at optical wavelengths as they just appear as normal galaxies in imaging data .",
    "although x - ray ( norman et al . 2002 ; stern et al . 2002 ) and pure spectroscopic ( jarvis et al . 2005 ) observations can find such sources at high redshift , it is with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ that this field has been revolutionized , with many groups using the fact that the dusty torus , heated by the central agn , reradiates at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "many methods based on mid - infrared observations have been used to find such agn ; lacy et al .",

    "it is highly unlikely that the difference between the evn and vla fluxes is due to agn variability ; whilst a factor of two in variation is typical of blazars , they demonstrate strong beamed continuum and/or broad emission lines , neither of which is observed in ams05 .",
    "whilst the lyman-@xmath3 emission bears great resemblance to the eelrs around h@xmath52rgs , the above arguments indicate that ams05 is an intrinsically different class of source .",
    "this can most clearly be seen in figure [ radio_lyman ] ; using the polynomial fit to extrapolate the radio luminosity of the lab host galaxy to 151 mhz in the rest frame we find that even though the luminosity in lyman-@xmath3 emission is similar to the median hzrgs drawn from the 3crr , 7crs , 6ce and 6c@xmath77 samples in jarvis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the luminosity at radio frequencies is several orders of magnitude lower .",
    "this source appears in many ways to be very similar to the low - redshift radio - quiet quasar e1821 + 643 ( blundell & rawlings 2001 ) , which exhibits quasar - like optical emission but also has fri - type radio emission over 100  kpc scales . blundell & rawlings explain this as a precessing jet , possibly due to a binary black hole system at the centre of the galaxy .",
    "this precession could result in an fri morphology , with around 50 per cent of the radio luminosity coming from the core , but the detectability of the extended emission becomes very difficult due to the reduced surface brightness on large scales .",
    "future low - frequency telescopes such as lofar would be ideally placed to map out such extended structures around such radio - quiet agn .     versus rest - frame 1400 mhz luminosity for a selection of high redshift galaxies known to possess lyman-@xmath3 haloes ( eales et al . , 1993 , mccarthy et al . , 1993 ; de breuck et al . , 2000",
    "; steidel et al . , 2000 ; francis et al . , 2001 ; jarvis et al . , 2001 , maxfield et al . , 2002 , reuland et al . , 2003 , villar - martn et al . , 2003 , dey et al . , 2005 ; smith & jarvis , 2007 , villar - martn et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "radio luminosities at 1400 mhz have been derived assuming power law seds of the form @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , except for ams05 , which uses the gigahertz peaked radio sed .",
    "hzrgs from de breuck et al .",
    ", 2000 have been included in order to better demonstrate that ams05 ( diamond ) does not belong to this class of object . ]",
    "we demonstrate that the agn generates enough photons to ionize the observed ly@xmath3 halo , using a photon number counts argument , similar to that described by neugebauer et al . , ( 1980 ) . by using the median unobscured qso sed from elvis ( 1994 ) , scaled to match our measured flux at 24@xmath30 m ( where the effects of obscuration by dust are negligible and the qso dominates the monochromatic luminosity )",
    ", we can estimate the number of photons emitted by the naked source before the effects of obscuration along our line of sight are taken into account .",
    "we find that the nucleus emits around 1.2 @xmath80 ionizing photons per second , which is @xmath81 orders of magnitude more than that which is emitted as lyman-@xmath3 photons .",
    "there is no doubt that the active nucleus is capable of ionizing the lyman-@xmath3 halo , although a starburst component could easily contribute as is postulated for hzrgs ( e.g. binette et al .",
    "2006 ; villar - martn et al .",
    "2007b ) , however this contribution is constrained by the mambo-2 observations .",
    "we have discovered the first highly - extended lyman-@xmath3-emitting halo around a radio - intermediate type-2 obscured qso .",
    "the halo , which is extended over @xmath180  kpc , is similar to those haloes observed around high - redshift radio galaxies , and the more quiescent lyman-@xmath3 blobs , with a luminosity estimated from our photometry of 1.50 @xmath82@xmath83(3.89 @xmath84 ) . by analogy with the high - redshift radio galaxies , where polarisation data help determine the source orientation on the sky",
    ", we interpret the velocity offset and decrease in velocity dispersion toward the edge of the halo as evidence for infall rather than outflow , although again this would need deeper radio observations to determine directly .",
    "the existence of lyman-@xmath3 `` fuzz '' around qsos at @xmath15 was predicted by haiman & rees ( 2001 ) , and alam & miralda  escud ( 2002 ) - with suggested angular sizes @xmath85@xmath25and 0.1 - 1.0@xmath25 , respectively . whilst one example of extension on small angular scales",
    "was presented in francis & mcdonnell ( 2006 ) , this new discovery is the first detection of a qso hosting an extensive lyman-@xmath3 halo of which the authors are aware .    the halo is associated with a gigahertz - peaked radio sed , although since ams05 is radio quiet , this does not imply that the radio source is young .",
    "the most likely cause of ionization of the large extended lyman-@xmath3 emission for this halo is photoionization from the central radio - quiet agn .",
    "however , we can not rule out that at least part of the excess in ly@xmath3 emission may arise from other sources , such as an episode of star formation ( e.g. binette et al . , 2006 ) or cooling radiation ( e.g. fardal et al . 2001 ; dijkstra et al . 2006a , b ) .",
    "ams05 appears similar to the low - redshift radio - quiet quasar e1821 + 643 which has large - scale fri radio struture but an optically powerful agn at its centre .",
    "blundell & rawlings ( 2001 ) suggest that the lack of bright emission on large scales in this source is due to a precessing jet caused by a binary black hole system , which would result in lower luminosity emission on the kpc scale .",
    "future observations with the next generation of radio telescopes could detect such emission around optically powerful but sub - luminous radio sources .",
