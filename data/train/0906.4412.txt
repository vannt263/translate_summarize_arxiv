    "light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of hadrons are key ingredients in the description of various exclusive processes of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and their role can be analogous to those of parton distributions in inclusive processes . in terms of the bethe - salpeter wave functions @xmath4 , lcdas @xmath5",
    "are defined by retaining the momentum fractions @xmath6 and integrating out the transverse momenta @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "they provide essential information on the non - perturbative structure of the hadron for qcd treatment of exclusive reactions .",
    "specifically , the leading twist lcdas describe the probability amplitudes to find the hadron in a fock state with the minimum number of constituents .",
    "in addition , the fact that @xmath8-physics exclusive processes are under investigation in babar and belle experiments , also urges the detailed study of hadronic lcdas . in literature , there have been many non - perturbative approaches to estimate lcdas , such as the qcd sum rules @xcite , lattice calculation @xcite , chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum @xcite , nabmbu - jona - lasinio model @xcite , and the light - front quark model @xcite .",
    "these studies have dealt with lcdas of pseudoscalar @xcite , vector @xcite , axial vector @xcite , and tensor @xcite mesons .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of leading twist lcdas of @xmath0-wave heavy quarkonium states which include the scalar ( @xmath9 ) , axial vector ( @xmath10 ) , and tensor ( @xmath11 ) mesons .",
    "the motivation of this study is as follows . since the discoveries of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , occurring more than thirty years ago , a great deal of information on heavy quarkonium levels and their transitions has been accumulated @xcite .",
    "the numerous transitions between heavy quarkonium states are classified as strong and radiative decays , which shed light on aspects of qcd in both the perturbative and the non - perturbative regimes ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , some experimental results regarding @xmath14 mesons have recently been reported @xcite .",
    "therefore , a thorough understanding of their properties , such as lcdas which are the universal non - perturbative objects , will be of great benefit when analyzing the hard exclusive processes with heavy quarkonium production .",
    "it is known that heavy quarkonium is relevant to non - relativistic treatments @xcite .",
    "although non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) is a powerful theoretical tool for separating high - energy modes from low - energy contributions , in most cases the calculation of low - energy hadronic matrix elements has relied on model - dependent non - perturbative methods . in this study , heavy quarkonium is explored within the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) which is a promising analytic method for solving the non - perturbative problems of hadron physics @xcite as well as offers many insights into the internal structures of bound states .",
    "the basic ingredient in lfqm is the relativistic hadron wave function which generalizes distribution amplitudes by including transverse momentum distributions , and contains all the information of a hadron from its constituents .",
    "the hadronic quantities are represented by the overlap of wave functions and can be derived in principle .",
    "the light - front wave function is manifestly a lorentz invariant , expressed in terms of internal momentum fraction variables which are independent of the total hadron momentum .",
    "moreover , the fully relativistic treatment of quark spins and center - of - mass motion can be carried out using the so - called melosh rotation @xcite .",
    "this treatment has been successfully applied to calculate phenomenologically many important meson decay constants and hadronic form factors @xcite .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of this study is the calculation of the leading twist lcdas of @xmath0-wave heavy quarkonium states within lfqm .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the leading twist lcdas of @xmath0-wave meson states are shown in cases of the vector and tensor currents . in section iii ,",
    "the formulism of lfqm is reviewed briefly , then the leading twist lcdas are extracted within lfqm .",
    "the @xmath3-moments of these lcdas are also calculated . in section",
    "iv , numerical results and discussions are presented .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in section v.",
