    "the eso imaging survey ( eis ; renzini & da costa 1997 ) is the outgrowth of a concerted effort between eso and its community to carry out an imaging survey and provide candidate targets for the rapidly approaching first year of regular operation of the vlt . the main science goals of the survey have been described earlier ( nonino 1998 , paper  i , prandoni 1998 , paper  iii ) .",
    "these papers also include a detailed account of the survey observing strategy , and of the data obtained for two of the four areas covered by the survey ( eis patches  a and b ) . one of the main goals of eis is the compilation of a list of candidate clusters of galaxies , spanning a range of redshifts .",
    "following the timetable recommended by the eis working group , lists of cluster candidates in the various areas covered by the survey are being prepared and made public as soon as they become available .",
    "in addition , an interface with the eso science archive has been created , allowing image postage stamps of the candidates to be extracted for visual inspection and preparation of finding charts ( see `` http://www.eso.org/eis/eis_release.html '' ) .",
    "a preliminary catalog containing 35 @xmath0 cluster candidates identified in eis patch  a , was presented in a previous paper ( olsen 1998 , hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "as emphasized in that paper , the goal has been to prepare a list of cluster _ candidates _ for follow - up observations and not to produce a well - defined sample for statistical analysis . for the cluster search the matched filter algorithm",
    "was chosen , since it has been tested and used to analyze similar data by postman ( 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , by using the same algorithm the results obtained here can be easily compared to those obtained by these authors .",
    "since the data are public , other groups may produce their own catalogs using different methods",
    ". a comparison of various catalogs will be instructive in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms .    while completeness is an important issue for statistical studies , the main concern of the eis cluster search program is the reliability of the candidates and the minimization of the number of false detections , to optimize any future follow - up work . to minimize contamination by spurious detections ,",
    "the analysis has been restricted to the most uniform surveyed areas . moreover ,",
    "the parameters adopted in searching for candidates have been conservatively chosen , using an extensive set of simulations , to minimize the contamination by noise peaks ( paper  ii ) .",
    "another way of further testing the reality of the detections is to use data in different passbands . in paper  ii candidate clusters",
    "were detected using only @xmath0-band data .",
    "currently , however , @xmath2-band images are available for @xmath1 2.7 square degrees .",
    "the availability of these data allows one to detect clusters in the @xmath2-band and cross - identify them with those detected in the @xmath0-band .",
    "the color information can be used : 1 ) to confirm the reality of detections directly from the cross - identification ; 2 ) to confirm detections by identifying the expected sequence of cluster early - type galaxies in the color - magnitude ( c - m ) diagram ; 3 ) to use the c - m relation to independently check the estimated cluster redshift .",
    "the goals of the present paper are to add to the list of eis @xmath0-band cluster candidates those detected in patch  b and to investigate what additional information the @xmath2-band data provides over the region where @xmath2 and @xmath0 images overlap .",
    "although the original intention of eis was to cover the entire survey area in @xmath2 and @xmath0 , this proved impossible due to the bad weather conditions in the period july  december 1997 . as a consequence",
    ", the observations in the @xmath2-band were discontinued after the completion of patch  b , to enlarge as much as possible the area covered in @xmath0-band .",
    "nevertheless , available @xmath2-band images overlap @xmath0-band observations over an area of 1.2 and 1.7 square degrees in patches  a and b , respectively . due to varying observing conditions the quality of the data is not uniform over the entire overlap region .",
    "this can be seen from the seeing and limiting isophote distributions shown in papers  i and iii .",
    "this information was used to eliminate regions with significantly shallower limiting magnitudes , due to poor transparency , and the following analysis is restricted to areas of @xmath4 ( patch  a ) and @xmath5 ( patch  b ) square degrees .",
    "the median seeing value for all the observations in the area being analyzed is @xmath6 arcsec .",
    "the data were reduced using the eis pipeline which routinely produces single - frame catalogs , that are associated to produce the so - called even and odd catalogs ( see papers  i and ii ) .",
    "this procedure has been performed independently for the @xmath2 and @xmath0 images , yielding two independent catalogs for each band and for each patch .",
    "galaxies have been selected from the @xmath0-band catalogs , adopting the same criteria as in previous papers of this series .",
    "as shown in papers  i and iii the 80% completeness limits of the galaxy catalogs extracted from single exposures are typically @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "using the various odd / even catalogs containing the objects extracted from single frames ( 150 sec exposures ) in both passbands , lists of clusters candidates are produced for each patch and band using the cluster identification pipeline based on the matched - filter method described in detail in paper  ii .",
    "the cluster identification has been applied to the new @xmath0-band data from patch  b ( @xmath9 ) , using the same parameters to describe the cluster radial profile and luminosity function as given in paper  ii .",
    "the detection of clusters from the @xmath2-band galaxy catalogs is carried out adopting @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the limiting magnitude of the galaxy sample .    in @xmath0-band",
    ", 19 new cluster candidates are found over the area of 1.1 square degrees analyzed in patch  b , out of which 12 are `` good '' candidates , namely those detected at @xmath12 in at least one catalog , or at @xmath13 in both @xmath0-band catalogs .",
    "in addition , there are 7 candidates detected at 3@xmath14 in only one catalog , nearly all at large redshift ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the number of questionable candidates is consistent with that expected for noise peaks , about 5 in the area analyzed in patch  b.    the above results are summarized in table  [ tab : cluster ] which gives : in column ( 1 ) the cluster i d ; in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the right ascension and declination ( j2000 ) ; in column ( 4 ) the estimated redshift ; in columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) two measures of the cluster richness ( see paper  ii ) ; in columns ( 7 ) and ( 8) the significance of the detections in the even and odd catalogs , respectively ; in column ( 9 ) the significance of the detection using the galaxy catalogs extracted from the @xmath2 images , as discussed below ; and in column ( 10 ) other identifications . the upper part of the table lists the `` good '' candidates , while the remaining candidates are listed in the lower part of the table . combining these detections with those of patch",
    "a reported in paper  ii , increases the total number of cluster candidates to 54 .",
    "note that the detection with the largest significance is the cluster easily seen near the center of the patch .",
    "this cluster is abell s84 at @xmath16 ( abell , corwin & olowin 1989 , strubble and rood 1987 ) .    [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     using the facility implemented in the eso science archive for extracting image postage stamps from the co - added images , all cluster candidates in patch  b were visually inspected and most are found to be promising . while candidates in the lower part of the table are less conspicuous , most do seem to be possible clusters .",
    "out of the seven candidates listed in the bottom part of the table , at least 4 lie in a region where the limiting isophote varies significantly between the odd and even frames which may explain the fact that they were detected only in the odd catalogs .",
    "note that 2 of them were detected in the @xmath2 catalogs . from this examination",
    "one also encounters cases where superposition of clusters at significantly different redshifts may occur .    combining the above sample with the 16 candidate clusters identified in the region of patch  a where color information is available yields 35 candidates over a 2 square degree area corresponding to a density of 17.5 candidates per square degree .",
    "this value is consistent with the results discussed in paper  ii and with the value estimated by postman ( 1996 ) .",
    "[ fig : colorhist ] shows the distribution of estimated redshifts for the combined sample .",
    "the median estimated redshift for the whole set presented in this figure is @xmath17 .",
    "cluster candidate detections in the @xmath2-band were cross - identified with @xmath0-band detections listed in table  [ tab : cluster ] , and those listed in paper  ii .",
    "the significance of the detections in the @xmath2-band for the case of patch  b cluster candidates is given in column ( 9 ) of table  [ tab : cluster ] .",
    "the shaded portion of the histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig : colorhist ] shows the distribution of estimated redshifts for the cluster candidates also detected in @xmath2-band ( whole sample ) . out of 19 candidates with @xmath3 , 17",
    "( @xmath1 90% ) are also detected in @xmath2-band ; for clusters at @xmath18 , 4 out of 16 are detected in @xmath2-band .",
    "this result is not surprising since the ability to detect clusters varies with redshift , with the redshift range of the @xmath2 candidates being smaller than in @xmath0 .",
    "using the rule of thumb that the data should reach at least one magnitude fainter than @xmath19 at the redshift of a given cluster to allow for its detection , one can translate the galaxy catalog limiting magnitudes adopted in the cluster search into limiting redshifts for cluster detection .",
    "the @xmath0-band limit of @xmath20 then translates into a limiting redshift between @xmath21 ( no - evolution model ) and @xmath22 ( passive evolution model ) .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the results presented in paper  ii , and by postman ( 1996 ) , where cluster detections are limited to @xmath23 . using the same argument ,",
    "the @xmath2-band limit of @xmath11 translates into a limiting redshift between @xmath24 ( no - evolution ) and @xmath25 ( passive evolution ) .",
    "this argument is consistent with the above findings , providing strong support for the reality of the detected candidates .",
    "the probability of detecting a cluster also depends on its richness . despite",
    "the small number statistics , nearby candidates not detected in @xmath2 data tend to be poor , with an estimated richness close to the lower limit adopted for the inclusion of a candidate in the catalog ( @xmath26 ) . at high - redshifts , only very rich clusters , probably with a large fraction of ellipticals , are detected in the two passbands .",
    "there are two such cases in the above table , but note that neither would have been included as cluster candidates based on the @xmath2 detection alone .",
    "their appearance on the images strongly suggests that both are at high redshifts .",
    "however , since some galaxies are seen in the @xmath2 images , either their matched filter redshifts are overestimated or there are foreground concentrations leading to their detection in the @xmath2 data . only spectroscopic follow - up will be able to resolve such cases .",
    "the availability of data in two passbands can , in principle , provide an alternative way of confirming cluster candidates and their estimated redshifts , based on the detection of the sequence of cluster early - type galaxies in a c - m diagram . in order to investigate this possibility , a [ @xmath0,@xmath27 diagram was produced for each cluster candidate , showing all galaxies within a radius of 0.75 h@xmath28 mpc ( h@xmath29 = 75 km s@xmath28/mpc ) from the nominal cluster center .",
    "[ fig : cm_diagram ] shows four examples of such diagrams , for cluster candidates identified in patches  a and b , illustrating cases with estimated redshift in the range @xmath30 .",
    "also indicated in the plot are the values of @xmath31 and the color of a typical elliptical ( no - evolution ) at the estimated redshift of the cluster , as derived from the matched filter . at low redshift ,",
    "the sequence of early - type galaxies is clearly visible , but at @xmath32 the evidence for a c - m relation is , in most cases , less compelling .",
    "considering the combined patch  a and b sample , one finds that out of 35 clusters in the region of overlap of the @xmath2- and @xmath0-band images , there are 19 with evidence for a c - m relation , with redshifts extending out to @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the redshift estimates based on color and the matched filter seem to agree , in most cases , within 0.1 . however , there are at least four cases where there is a strong suggestion that the matched filter has overestimated the redshift .",
    "in this letter 19 additional @xmath0 cluster candidates detected in eis patch  b have been presented .",
    "clusters have also been detected from the galaxy catalogs extracted from the @xmath2 images available in patches a and b. these clusters have been cross - identified with @xmath0 detections , from which the following general conclusions can be drawn :    1 .",
    "about 90% of the cluster candidates with @xmath3 and about 25% with @xmath34 , primarily rich clusters , are confirmed using the @xmath2 candidates .",
    "this gives further support to the @xmath0 cluster candidates listed here and in paper  ii .",
    "candidates at low - redshift show the c - m relations expected for ellipticals , serving as an independent confirmation of the candidate clusters .",
    "they also provide an independent redshift estimate , which is in general consistent with the estimates from the matched filter method .",
    "3 .   the well - defined c - m relations seen in at least @xmath1 50% of the cases , most of them with @xmath35 , provide the possibility of selecting individual galaxies for follow - up spectroscopy to measure more accurate redshifts and velocity dispersions .",
    "the above results demonstrate the usefulness of @xmath2-band observations for the robust detection of clusters .",
    "however , to extend the additional leverage provided by the color information to redshifts larger than @xmath36 requires @xmath2 exposures deeper than those obtained for eis .",
    "this option should be considered for future surveys using wide - field cameras , in particular in the pilot survey ( renzini 1998 ) to be conducted at the eso 2.2 m telescope .",
    "the data presented here were taken at the new technology telescope at the la silla observatory under the program ids 59.a-9005(a ) and 60.a-9005(a ) .",
    "we thank all the people directly or indirectly involved in the eso imaging survey effort . in particular , all the members of the eis working group for the innumerable suggestions and constructive criticisms , the eso archive group and st - ecf for their support .",
    "our special thanks to a. renzini , vlt programme scientist , for his scientific input , support and dedication in making this project a success .",
    "finally , we would like to thank eso s director general riccardo giacconi for making this effort possible .",
