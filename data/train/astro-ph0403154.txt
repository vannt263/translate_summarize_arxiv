    "one of the tantalising and yet unanswered questions of contemporary astrophysics is that concerning the nature of dark matter ( dm ) . while its existence has been inferred for several decades , only in the recent past its amount has been carefully assessed on various astrophysical scales . on galaxy scales ,",
    "the classical and still most powerful tool to unveil dm is that of rotation curves .",
    "compared to the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite , modern studies take advantage from greatly improved observational techniques , facilitating much more significant validations of cosmological theories , such as cold dark matter ( cdm ) . although the prime astrophysical importance of the juxtaposition of observations and models was assessing the amount of dm in galaxies @xcite , the timed question has become its _",
    "distribution_. this issue directly pertains to the nature of this component , since a precise knowledge of the density profile @xmath4 is likely to be decisive : the dm nature is likely to determine the halo properties .    yet",
    ", a wealth of observations have not been able to settle but the most fundamental issues , such as the validity of the cdm scenario on galactic scales ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some of the shortcomings on the observational side were related to the limitations of optical rotation curves ( internal rms , limited radial extent , dust contamination ) , while radio studies were affected by the well - known limited spatial resolution .",
    "nevertheless , progress has been made , due to the increasing number of investigations on dwarf spirals and low - surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "these studies cast serious doubts on one of the fundamental properties of cdm haloes , namely their cuspiness in the galaxy centres , and infer the presence of large core radii in the dm density profiles ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the many steps in the data analysis , there can be subtle systematic errors that could distort the results or in any case render the results very poorly constrained .",
    "this has triggered off the recent debate concerning the reliability of the data and how well the mass models are really constrained .",
    "there are claims that the observations could actually be consistent with the dark matter density profiles predicted by the cdm simulations , not only by considering the hi data alone ( @xcite and @xcite ) , but also by combining h@xmath0 and hi data ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is the reason why particular care should be taken in choosing a suited sample and in performing the data analysis .",
    "note that recent simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) do not converge to a well - defined value of the inner slope down to the resolution limit ( about 1 kpc ) , even though the slope of the dark matter density profile ( defined as @xmath5 ) at 1% of the virial radius is still about 1.2 for a typical galaxy .",
    "notice also that the observational results on spiral galaxies show a discrepancy with the standard @xmath1cdm predictions well beyond 1 kpc , i.e. well beyond the resolution limit of the simulations .",
    "in this paper we study a _",
    "sample _ of galaxy rotation curves ideal for deriving the properties of the dark matter haloes around galaxies ; it consists of five late - type bulge - less normal ( high surface brightness ) spiral galaxies ; compared to the sample of @xcite we have the same resolution in the central regions , but a larger spatial extension allowing us to determine the size of the core radii .",
    "one of the main concerns is that the rotation curve has both a high spatial resolution and a large extension , i.e. beyond the optical radius ; this is typically achieved by combining optical ( h@xmath0 ) and radio ( hi ) data ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the former provide the necessary high resolution ( 1@xmath6 ) while the latter allow us to trace the potential out to large radii , typically 23 times the optical radius .",
    "it has been known for a long time that hi data usually suffer from the lack of resolution , which can affect the results , especially in the innermost parts ; this problem is nicely reviewed by @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in deriving reliable rotation curves from hi data cubes resides in the fact that a data cube is 4-dimensional ( ra , dec , flux density and radial velocity ) , while the rotation curve is 2-dimensional ( rotation velocity vs. radius ) .",
    "this means that starting from the data cube we have to take into account two types of considerations : one concerning the _ positions _ in which the rotation curve should be traced , i.e. how to reduce the spatial dimensions from ( ra , dec ) to galactocentric radius .",
    "this is usually achieved by taking the position - velocity diagram along the major axis or by fitting concentric ellipses around the centre ( tilted - ring modelling of the velocity field ) .",
    "the other consideration concerns the _ rotation velocities _ that should be attributed to these galactocentric radii : at the positions defined above we want to associate only one of the possible velocities that could in principle be derived from the spectra at single points ( flux density vs. radial velocity ) , i.e. the radial component of the rotation velocity at that radius .",
    "this is usually done via different methods , most of them assuming symmetry of the profiles , like the first - moment analysis ( the intensity weighted mean ) , or the single gaussian fitting ; therefore , when the profiles are not symmetric , i.e. in galaxies with a high inclination and/or a poor to intermediate resolution , these methods can not be applied .

    "the correlator setup yielded 512 channels of width 15.6 khz , resulting in a total bandwidth of 8 mhz .",
    "the data were subsequently hanning - smoothed to have a better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the final spectral resolution was 31.2 khz , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 6.6 km s@xmath7 .",
    "ngc 1090 and ngc 7339 were observed with the very large array in the c configuration , with baselines ranging from 35 m to 3400 m. the galaxies were observed for 8 hrs with a correlator mode which had 4 ifs , each if pair having slightly different frequency centres ; this was done in order to find a compromise between velocity resolution and bandwidth .",
    "we had @xmath8 channels of width 24.4 khz and a total bandwidth of 2.685 mhz ; taking into account the overlapping channels , the total number of channels is 112 .",
    "the resulting velocity resolution is @xmath9 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the standard flagging and calibration of the @xmath10 data from the atca observations was performed within the software package miriad ( @xcite ) , while the the vla data observations were flagged and calibrated with the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) .",
    "the rest of the reduction was performed in miriad .    using a number of line - free channels ( 10  40 ) on each side of the line , the continuum contribution to the @xmath10 data",
    "was calculated performing a linear fit ; this contribution was then subtracted from the data .",
    "then , we produced a data cube with robust parameters @xcite ranging from 0 to 0.3 , to reach an ideal compromise between high signal - to - noise ratio and small beam size ; these values correspond to a weighting scheme of the @xmath10 data intermediate between uniform and natural weighting .",
    "the data were then cleaned , first on a small region with emission and then on the whole map , with a total of 2500 iterations per channel map .",
    "the data were then restored with a gaussian beam .",
    "depending on the galaxies , we obtained beam sizes ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the observational parameters are listed in table [ observational ] .",
    "from the cleaned cubes , new cubes with lower resolution were constructed ( with a beam size about twice the original ) .",
    "this was done in order to distinguish genuine emission from spurious one ; we considered as having reliable emission all the regions with an intensity @xmath13 in the low - resolution cube ; spurious noise was also removed .",
    "moment-0 maps ( total intensity maps ) were derived based on the `` masked '' cubes .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ radopt2 ] , superimposed with optical dss images .",
    "the first contour is the `` pseudo 3-@xmath14 '' level defined in a way similar to : we define the noise at a certain position in the total intensity map as :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the number of channels that have been added at each position in the total intensity map and @xmath17 is the noise in the hanning - smoothed channel maps .",
    "the `` pseudo 3-@xmath14 '' level is obtained by averaging all the pixels with a signal - to - noise ratio between 2.75 and 3.25 .",
    "from fig .  [ radopt2 ]",
    "we note that the galaxies have a relatively high inclination and the hi emission has a large ( up to @xmath18 3 times ) extent compared to the optical disc .",
    "the hi masses ( @xmath19 ) given in table [ physical ] were calculated from the total intensity maps after primary - beam correction using the following relation :    @xmath20    where @xmath19 is in @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the distance of the galaxy in mpc and @xmath23 is the total hi flux density in the total intensity map , measured in jy km s@xmath7 .",
    "the hi masses are in agreement with previous single - dish measurements to within 20% , implying that we are not losing much extended emission due to missing zero spacings .    the radial distribution of the neutral hydrogen surface density is computed by integrating the total intensity map over concentric ellipses for ngc 1090 and by means of the lucy method @xcite for the other galaxies .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  [ raddens ] , where one can notice that the data reach the region where @xmath24 starts to decrease .",
    "since the velocity field of ngc 1090 is sufficiently sampled , it could be subjected to tilted - ring modelling @xcite . in this case",
    "the met method was applied ( see the next section ) to construct the velocity field and then the first estimate of the rotation curve was derived by performing a tilted - ring fit to the velocity field . in the other cases",
    "the combination of high inclination and a large beam ( compared to the size of the galaxy ) requires the use of the wamet method : we traced the rotation curve along the warp on points defined like in @xcite and implemented for studies of the kinematics by @xcite on the total intensity map , we fit gaussians to the density profiles parallel the minor axis , defining the position of the peak of the gaussian as the `` ridge '' of the warp .    concerning the analysis of the velocity profiles , particular care was taken in deriving the rotation velocity because they were in general asymmetric .",
    "in fig .  [ spectrum ]",
    "we show an example of a typical profile at an intermediate galactocentric distance : it is not symmetric and it has a tail towards the systemic velocity .",
    "this is what we expect in case of a highly inclined galaxy , because ( see fig .  [ plane ] ) what we observe is the integration along a large portion of the disc , so that material with lower radial velocities also contributes to the velocity profile .",
    "note , however , that fig .  [ plane ] represents the extreme edge - on case : the galaxies studied here were chosen to have lower inclinations , so the portion of the disc intercepted by the line - of - sight is smaller .",
    "moreover , from recent results ( @xcite , @xcite ) , it seems that at least in some spiral galaxies there is evidence for neutral hydrogen at several kpc away from the galactic plane that rotates more slowly than the gas in the disc ; this effect also produces an asymmetry of the velocity profiles in galaxies that do not have a high inclination .",
    "the result is that the standard methods ( e.g. first - moment analysis and single - gaussian fitting ) , which implicitly assume symmetry of the profiles , provide velocities that are biased towards the systemic velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) and can not be used to determine the true rotation velocity in the galaxies of our sample .",
    "in order to solve the problems discussed in the previous section , we built a method similar to the envelope - tracing method ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) ; the aim is to fit only the side of the profiles which we are interested in , i.e. the extreme velocity side ( with the assumption that the gas is present at these extreme velocities ) .",
    "the first step was to fit a half - gaussian from the peak of the profiles to their extreme velocity side ( i.e. the side opposite to the systemic velocity ) , considering the velocity at half maximum , the terminal velocity ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the rotation velocity @xmath26 at a certain position is then given by : @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the inclination , @xmath29 is the systemic velocity , and the terms indicated with @xmath30 describe the profile broadenings ( in terms of full width to half maximum , fwhm ) :    @xmath31 is the broadening due to the turbulence of the interstellar medium , by assuming a constant velocity dispersion of the ism , @xmath32 km s@xmath7 ( a typical value for spiral galaxies ) , which implies :    @xmath33    notice that following @xcite ( i.e. taking @xmath34 going from 12 to 7 km s@xmath7 ) would not significantly affect the derived rotation curves .    @xmath35 is the instrumental contribution to the profile broadening , which we set equal to the channel resolution : 6.6 km s@xmath7 for the galaxies observed with the atca and 5.2 km s@xmath7 for those observed with the vla .",
    "@xmath36 is an estimate of the broadening of the profiles due to the beam : as is evident in fig .",
    "[ plane ] , a larger beam will sample a larger portion of the velocity field and will thus broaden the profiles , even on their extreme velocity side . according to @xcite , a lower limit to @xmath36",
    "can be given by setting it to zero , yielding an upper limit to the rotation velocity .",
    "to estimate an upper limit to @xmath36 , we assume as in @xcite , that the expected beam uncertainty in the profile widths is @xmath37 $ ] , where the `` @xmath38 '' corresponds to a positive gradient of the velocity field and `` @xmath39 '' to a negative one ; @xmath40 is the beam fwhm .    with an upper limit and a lower limit to @xmath36",
    ", we decided to estimate @xmath36 using their average , i.e :    @xmath41    met / wamet has the following advantages :    * the profiles are asymmetric , thus methods assuming symmetry can not be used to derive the rotation velocity ; they would underestimate the rotation velocities , especially in the inner parts .",
    "* we are only interested in the extreme velocity side of the profiles because it is not ( or little ) affected by projection effects .",
    "* it also estimates the correction for the beam broadening of the profiles , which can be substantial in regions where the gradient of the velocity field is high .",
    "the implemented method ( wamet ) for warped galaxies can be applied to galaxies where the sampling of the velocity field is poor , and it enables us to trace the rotation curve along any possible warp instead of keeping a fixed position angle , like in methods based on the analysis of the position - velocity diagram ; the shortcomings of keeping a fixed position angle are discussed in @xcite .",
    "in order to derive the rotation curves , we applied the tilted - ring modelling of the velocity field for ngc 1090 . for the other galaxies we determined the kinematical centre and the systemic velocity by minimising the differences between the two sides .",
    "the errors are the maximum of the three following values : the difference between the velocities of the approaching and the receding sides , our correction for beam broadening of the profiles , and a `` minimum error '' equal to ( @xmath42 ) km s@xmath7 .",
    "the met / wamet rotation curve served as an input to construct model data cubes with the task galmod within gipsy @xcite ; these models have been then compared to the observed data cubes .",
    "such models are built with the assumption that the neutral hydrogen moves along circular orbits ; a series of geometrical and physical parameters , among which the rotation curve , allows us to create model observations of the hi discs .",
    "these models , when compared to the real data cubes , verify whether they are a fair representation of the hi disc .",
    "some input parameters are inferred directly from the observations and kept fixed ( e.g. , the surface density profile ) , while others ( e.g. , the kinematical centre and the systemic velocity ) are first estimated from the observations and then adjusted in order to optimise the match between the observed and the model cubes .    in two cases ( eso 287-g13 and ngc 1090 , the galaxies with the steepest rotation curves ) the rotation curve derived with met / wamet had to be slightly modified in order to better reproduce the observed data cubes .",
    "we found out that it was necessary to increase the value of the rotation velocity of the 23 innermost points by values of the order of their @xmath43 error ; this is probably due to the fact that , even with the met / wamet method , when the rotation curve rises steeply we are not able to retrieve precisely the true rotation velocity ; this is however possible by modelling the data cube . in fig .",
    "[ channels2 ] , we display some channel maps ( observed and modelled ) to show that with our final rotation curves we are able to provide a very good reproduction of the observations .",
    "all the galaxies of our sample were successfully modelled with a small warp in the outer parts or with no warp at all . in particular , we found necessary to include in our model parameters a 5@xmath44 clockwise warp in eso 116-g12 , a 2@xmath44 clockwise warp in eso 79-g14 and a 2@xmath44 anti - clockwise warp in ngc 1090 . concerning the inclination as a function of radius",
    ", it was kept constant at the values given in table [ physical ] , except for the galaxy eso 79-g14 , where a 5@xmath44 decrease of the inclination in the outer parts was necessary to reproduce the shape of the extreme channels .",
    "the errors on the derived orientation angles are of a few degrees ( @xcite ) .    using the rotation curves derived from other methods provided data cubes that were clearly different from those observed . in fig .",
    "[ compar ] , for the galaxy eso 116-g12 , we show some channel maps and the position - velocity diagram along the major axis of the observed data cube , of a model created from the corrected met / wamet rotation curve and of a model created from the first - moment rotation curve .",
    "the latter clearly fails in reproducing some of the observed features , like the shape of the extreme channels and the slope of the position - velocity diagram .",
    "fitting single gaussians to the velocity profiles gives very similar results to the first - moment rotation curve .    in order to assess the validity of a model we used a number of tools to visualise the different properties of the data cube .",
    "in particular , the model has to simultaneously match the intensity and shape of the emission in the single channel maps , the column density distribution in the moment-0 map , and the intensity and shape of the emission in the position - velocity diagrams , along the major and minor axis and on slices displaced with respect to the galactic centre .",
    "the comparison of model data cubes to the observations is a very powerful and crucial test to check quality and reliability of the rotation curves .    in fig .",
    "[ pvrc2 ] , we show the h@xmath0 and hi rotation curves projected onto the hi position - velocity diagrams of the galaxies of our sample : the agreement between the two datasets is good and , as should be expected , the hi rotation curves follow the shape of the last contours of the position - velocity diagrams .",
    "the hi rotation curves agree with the h@xmath0 data within 1 @xmath14 for the bulk of the points . in the case of ngc 1090 , however , at some radii there is an offset of about 10 km s@xmath7 between the two data sets : in fig .",
    "[ pvrc2 ] one can see that the h@xmath0 data lie above the hi rotation curve ; the figure shows that it is not an error in the hi data reduction , but rather an intrinsic difference , maybe due to non - circular motions associated with the small bar visible in the optical image .",
    "the optical image of eso 116-g12 looks a bit asymmetric , but the kinematics is not , while the other galaxies look symmetric in both the kinematics and the photometry , which tells us that apart from ngc 1090 the effects of possible hidden bars are negligible .",
    "we plot about two points per beam for the hi rotation curve : this was done in order to have a comparable number of hi and h@xmath0 points .",
    "plotting fewer hi points would result in the h@xmath0 data outnumbering the hi data and biasing the rotation curve fits .",
    "we also compared the h@xmath0 data with the hi rotation curves derived with two different methods ( fig .",
    "[ rc ] ) : our corrected met / wamet method and the first - moment . the latter yields a much worse agreement with the h@xmath0 rotation curves , especially in the inner parts where the profiles are most asymmetric : in these cases the rotation velocities are severely underestimated .",
    "this shows the importance of the particular care that should be taken in deriving rotation curves .",
    "the symmetry and smoothness of the rotation curves in the selected sample , along with the good agreement between the two datasets make these galaxies ideal laboratories for a dark matter study based on the kinematics : this holds in particular because they lack large non - circular motions , a major factor of disturbance and uncertainty in this kind of study .",
    "the agreement between the h@xmath0 and hi rotation curves also tells us that any systematic errors that might artificially render the rotation curve shallower ( i.e. extinction in the h@xmath0 data , bad positioning of the slit , low resolution of the hi data ) are small .",
    "note that the h@xmath0 data are absolutely necessary for a mass decomposition such as the one presented in the next sections .",
    "the uncertainties in the inner parts of the hi rotation curves are quite large ( typically 1020 km s@xmath7 ) , therefore nearly all the mass models fitted would be consistent with the data , disabling us from putting any constraints on the dark matter distribution .",
    "the actual uncertainties on the rotation velocities are probably smaller , due to the precision than can be reached with the data cube modelling ; however , they are difficult to estimate and rather subjective , therefore we keep the above estimated errors .",
    "the sample allows us to test in detail different mass models with various distributions and relative amounts of dark matter .      in order to study the properties of luminous and dark matter in these galaxies",
    ", we model the circular velocity @xmath45 in terms of the disc , gas and halo components :    @xmath46    @xmath47 is the contribution of the stellar disc , which is scaled according to the chosen ( stellar , i - band ) m / l ratio ( hereafter @xmath48 ) . in this way , the molecular gas is automatically taken into account , since it is reasonable to assume that it is distributed like the stellar component ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the available photometry shows that the luminous matter in these galaxies is distributed like in an exponential thin disc , whose value is given in table [ physical ] @xcite .",
    "the exception to this is eso 79-g14 , whose profile is significantly different from exponential : for this galaxy the actual surface brightness profile was used .",
    "@xmath48 ( assumed to be constant with radius ) is a free parameter in each model , however , with the condition of being larger than 0.2 .",
    "@xmath49 is the contribution of the gaseous disc , derived from the hi surface density distribution , scaled up by a factor 1.33 to account for primordial helium ; the uncertainty of the galaxy distance is irrelevant for the present study since at no radius the hi contribution dominates the kinematics .",
    "@xmath50 is the contribution of the dark matter halo , derived under a number of assumptions as discussed below .",
    "@xcite proposed an empirical density distribution of dark matter :    @xmath51    here , @xmath52 is the central density and @xmath53 the core radius .",
    "this halo has a constant density core , @xmath54 for @xmath55 , and a decrease of the density as @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "the halo has two free parameters : the core radius @xmath58 ( i.e. , in units of the optical radius , @xmath59 ) and the central density @xmath52 .",
    "other cored distributions were investigated ( the pseudo - isothermal halo , @xcite , and the universal rotation curve halo , @xcite , hereafter pss ) , but they yield results which are almost indistinguishable from the burkert halo . we include them in table [ tab - param ] for completeness .",
    "@xcite fitted the outcome of n - body cdm simulations with a density distribution given by :    @xmath60    here , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the characteristic density and the scale radius of the distribution .",
    "they are in principle independent , but recent results ( @xcite , @xcite ) show a correlation between these parameters .",
    "the nfw density distribution is then a one - parameter family , namely the virial mass @xmath63 .",
    "from @xcite we take the relations linking @xmath63 to the concentration parameter @xmath64 , @xmath62 and @xmath61 , at redshift @xmath65 and for a universe with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , starting with @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 is the virial overdensity and its value is about 337 at @xmath65 , @xmath70 is the critical density of the universe and @xmath71 is the virial radius ) :    @xmath72    @xmath73    nfw halo has then a central density cusp , with @xmath74 for @xmath55 , and a profile / amplitude which is controlled by a free parameter @xmath63 .",
    "notice that in principle , adiabatic contraction of the primordial dark matter halo due to baryon infall should be taken into account , but since the effect is to render the halo even more concentrated , aggravating thus the known problems of the nfw haloes , we neglect it .",
    "we constrain the virial halo mass to be @xmath75 m@xmath76 , in that , for a low luminosity spiral , it must presumably be substantially lower than that of the milky way and other very luminous galaxies , for which it is safely estimated : @xmath77 m@xmath76 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this constraint affects only n7339 and eso 79-g14 , due to the relatively limited extension of their hi rotation curves , which prevents to rule out large @xmath1cdm haloes .",
    "recent numerical simulations by @xcite yielded a more concentrated density profile :    @xmath78    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the characteristic density and the scale radius of the distribution .",
    "this density distribution has an even steeper cusp ( @xmath79 for @xmath55 ) than the previous one . similarly to the nfw halo",
    ", we consider this profile as having only one free parameter .",
    "following @xcite , we define @xmath80 as being 1.8 times smaller than @xmath81 ; it is then derived from eq .",
    "[ cmvir ] . for a given virial radius , the scale radius @xmath62 of the moore halo",
    "will then be 1.8 times larger than its corresponding quantity for the nfw halo .",

    "early studies of hi rotation curves @xcite noted the fact that the ratio between the hi surface density and the dark matter surface density is approximately constant in the outer parts of galaxies ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "this led to the hypothesis that dark matter could in some way be associated with the hi disc and distributed in the same manner ; this is what is reasonable to expect in the case of models considering for instance h@xmath84 clumps as a component of dark matter @xcite . in this case",

    "[ bur ] we plot the galaxies of our sample in the @xmath169 plane of @xcite , slightly adapted to spiral galaxies by @xcite : despite a certain scatter , they roughly follow the relation , which certainly has an implication for the nature of dark matter .",

    "we have presented an analysis of hi data cubes of a sample of five low - luminosity spiral galaxies that are used to derive the distribution of dark matter within these galaxies , along with available h@xmath0 and i - band photometric data .",
    "we found a new method ( the met / wamet method ) for deriving the hi rotation curves , which was needed to take into account a ) a position angle that varies with radius ( this is needed as the tilted - ring modelling of the velocity field could be used in only one case ) , and b ) the asymmetry of the velocity profiles , because the galaxies of our sample have a high inclination , and projection effects yield asymmetric velocity profiles .",
    "corrections were applied in order to account for any effects that artificially broaden the hi profiles .",
    "the rotation curves derived in this way passed a crucial test , i.e. the construction of model data cubes using these rotation curves as an input . in some cases the hi rotation curves derived from met / wamet required a small modification , mostly in the inner parts .",
    "after these small corrections the model data cubes are in very good agreement with the observations , contrary to model data cubes constructed using rotation curves derived from other `` classical '' methods . our final hi rotation curves are consistent with the h@xmath0 data , but up to three times more extended .    in galaxies well suited for inferring the distribution of dark matter , we were able to trace the total potential via the rotation velocity and to derive the density distribution of dark matter .    from the analysis of combined h@xmath0 and hi rotation curves we reach the following conclusions :    * cored haloes uniquely fit the rotation curves , with core radii of order @xmath171 and central densities of order @xmath172 g @xmath168 .",
    "* nfw haloes can not represent the dark matter haloes around the galaxies of our sample : they fit badly and a significant number of data points is inconsistent with the fits .",
    "* the situation is even worse for the moore model , as implied by its steeper inner profile .",
    "*   there are cases in which for radii in the range @xmath173 the burkert and nfw halo rotation curves are similar ; this may explain why in the literature cases can be found ( e.g. @xcite ) in which both models fit equally well a rotation curve of small extension and limited resolution .",
    "we thus reach the conclusion that the galaxies of the present sample are uniquely successfully fitted by cored haloes , with a core size comparable to the optical radius .",
    "this suggests the existence of a well - defined scale length in dark matter haloes , linked to the luminous matter , which is totally unexpected in the framework of cdm theory ( see @xcite ) .",
