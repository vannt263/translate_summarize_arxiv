    "then , we have set @xmath144 is the @xmath145 coupling constant [ 6 ] .",
    "the value 9@xmath119 can be reduced by including the contribution of the pseudoscalar @xmath146 meson .",
    "this confirms that with a good accuracy the one  pion exchange dominates in pp reactions for @xmath1k@xmath2 and @xmath3k@xmath2 production at thresholds of the final p@xmath1k@xmath2 and p@xmath3k@xmath2 states .",
    "we do not take into account the contributions of baryon resonances @xmath134 , @xmath135 and so on [ 16 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the obtained agreement with the experimental data allows us to think that effectively the contributions of baryon resonances can be partly reproduced by the amplitude of the pp interaction in the initial state .    in our approach the daugther proton and the @xmath1 hyperon as well as the daugther proton and the @xmath3 hyperon are in the spin  singlet state .",
    "this implies that the direction of the spin of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 hyperons is strictly opposite to the direction of the spin of the daugther proton .",
    "thereby , according to our approach by measuring a polarization of the daughter proton one measures unambiguously a polarization of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 hyperons .",
    "of course , this is true only for the excess of energies very close to thresholds of the final states p@xmath1k@xmath2 and p@xmath3k@xmath2 . for the excess of energies",
    "when the contribution of the spin ",
    "triplet state of the p@xmath1 and p@xmath3 system becomes perceptible the polarizations of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 hyperons are not so strictly determined .",
    "we are planning to carry out the analyse of the polarization properties of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 hyperons by taking into account the contribution of the spin ",
    "triplet states of the p@xmath1 and p@xmath3 systems in our forthcoming publications p + @xmath1 + k@xmath2 and p + p @xmath0 p + @xmath3 + k@xmath2 with polarized colliding protons near thresholds of the final states p@xmath1k@xmath2 and p@xmath3k@xmath2 ,",
    "respectively , has been carried out by rekalo _",
    "[ 22 ] . ] .",
    "recent measurements of the polarization of the @xmath1 hyperon in the reaction p + p @xmath0 p + @xmath1 + k@xmath2 at the excess of energy @xmath147 [ 23 ] evidence an advantage of the k@xmath2meson exchange mechanism [ 24 ] with respect to the one  pion exchange one",
    ". in our approach being valid for the excess of energies much less than @xmath147 the contribution of the k@xmath2meson exchange makes up about 0.1@xmath119 in comparison with the exchange by the @xmath21 meson .",
