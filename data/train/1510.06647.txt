    ", @xmath0 , bernoulli s equation requires that @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fluid speed and @xmath3 is the gravitational parameter .",
    "the nonlinearity of forms the primary difficulty of analysis ; in order to make any sort of progress , the equation must usually be linearized . as explained by tuck  @xcite , this linearization will typically involve making one of two possible assumptions .    in the first",
    ", the relevant flow quantities are expressed as a series expansion in powers of a geometric parameter such as @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , one might assume that at leading order , the object is asymptotically thin or streamline in one or several of its dimensions .",
    "as particular examples of note , a ship can be approximated by a single point source ( as studied by lord kelvin  @xcite ) or a series of point sources along its centre plane ( as studied by michell  @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , but also consistent with the limit @xmath5 , is the assumption that the body is submerged at a large depth compared to its own dimensions . then , for such an approach , the leading - order solution describes flow past the body in an infinite fluid without a free surface .",
    "however , approximation schemes dependent on taking the limit of some geometric parameter can be difficult to justify formally as boundary conditions are applied at approximate locations rather than exact locations  @xcite . thus for instance , flow past a circular cylinder can be approximated by flow past a dipole , but a finite - order approximation ( in powers of the cylinder radius ) can never yield a closed streamline around the body . even beyond the inability to satisfy the exact body conditions ,",
    "another limitation of such approaches is that they say very little about the situation of flow around nonlinear or bluff bodies ; this is a crucial limitation for our purposes .",
    "the second linearization of is more suitable for developing a theory of thick or bluff bodies . in this approach",
    ", the relevant small parameter is typically related to the froude number , written as @xmath6 . as @xmath7 ,",
    "the body is assumed to move at low speeds , and at leading - order , the free surface is entirely flat .",
    "the great advantage of this approach is that there is no geometrical restriction placed on the body ; thus the associated boundary conditions are satisfied exactly to all orders .",
    "the challenge , however , is that the limit @xmath7 is singular .",
    "the free - surface waves are exponentially small and their amplitudes scale as @xmath8 .",
    "thus they are said to be _ beyond - all - orders _ of any regular expansion in powers of @xmath9 .",
    "the inability to detect the surface waves using standardized methods in perturbation theory is known as ogilvie s _ low - froude paradox _  , based on francis ogilvie s seminal observations in 1968  @xcite .    in the fifty years that followed ogilvie s original work ,",
    "the low - froude paradox was eventually resolved through the combined efforts of many researchers .",
    "we mention , for example , works by dagan & tulin  @xcite , vanden - breock & tuck  @xcite , and ogilvie & chen  @xcite , but a more comprehensive review can be found in @xcite .",
    "chapman & vanden - broeck  @xcite were the first to leverage modern techniques of exponential asymptotics to the study of the low - froude flows  in prior work , without such techniques , the derived surface quantities were often asymptotically inconsistent .",
    "the difficulty , though , in applying such techniques is their relative complexity ; these methods requires notions of estimating asymptotic divergence , optimal truncation , inner - and - outer boundary layer matching , and the stokes phenomenon .",

    "we ask : _ is there a more intuitive approach to the study of such low - froude flows ? _    in this paper , we shall demonstrate that , for the particular case of gravity - driven flow , there exists a powerful and visual methodology for the study of wave - body interactions .",
    "this approach is made possible through a reduction of the water wave equations to a single first - order complex - valued differential equation that can be integrated .",
    "in fact , there is a rich history that underlies the development of the methodology , as introduced in the companion paper  @xcite , and originating from the works of tulin  @xcite and tuck  @xcite . before embarking on the present paper ,",
    "we highly recommend a reading of the historical significance of the problem , as presented in @xcite .",
    "we first provide a brief review of the main results of the companion paper .",
    ". the surface profile , @xmath10 , in ( a ) corresponds to the numerical solution of the full nonlinear equations at @xmath11 .",
    "the profiles in ( b ) correspond to the surface speed @xmath12 , as a function of the potential @xmath13 ; as seen , there is close agreement with the simplified models . the riemann surface ( c )",

    "[ fig : outline ] ]    for the moment , let us consider potential free - surface flow past the stern of a surface - piercing ship , modeled as the two - dimensional semi - infinite geometry shown in fig .",

    "the physical coordinates are denoted by @xmath14 and the complex potential by @xmath15 , for velocity potential @xmath13 and streamfunction @xmath16 .",
    "then , our task is to solve for the speed , @xmath17 , and streamline angle , @xmath18 , on the free surface , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the governing water - wave equations are reviewed in appendix  [ sec : gov ] , and are given in non - dimensional form by @xmath21 here , we have introduced an operator for a principal - value integral known as the hilbert transform .",

    "the second is a boundary - integral equation , written so as to split the integral on the solid body @xmath26 where @xmath27 is assumed to be known , with the hilbert transform of @xmath27 over the unknown free surface @xmath28 . for the surface - piercing configuration",
    ", we also specify that the free surface attaches to the body at a stagnation point , @xmath29 .    for a semi - infinite ship with the single stern - face of angle @xmath30 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : outline ] , the only length scale is the distance from the stagnation point to the corner .",
    "thus , we may non - dimensionalize the problem so that the corner lies at @xmath31 , and the body can be specified as @xmath32 the above body shape is then used in , and the two equations can be numerically solved using the finite - difference schemes discussed in _ e.g. _ @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : outline](a ) , we have plotted the physical free surface height , @xmath10 , obtained by integrating @xmath33 once @xmath2 and @xmath27 are known .    a typical numerical solution for the case of a rectangular stern , @xmath34 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : outline](a ) at @xmath35 .",
    "although the two - dimensional semi - infinite geometry of may seem rather idealized , it presents a canonical model of wave - structure interaction with a variety of numerical and analytical challenges .",
    "these two - dimensional hull shapes have been considered in _",
    "e.g. _ the works of @xcite , but similar considerations can be extended to ships with multiple corners @xcite , or ships with smooth or bulbous profiles @xcite .",
    "now the major difficulty in solving is that the hilbert transform is a global operator , and thus it requires the very values of @xmath27 that we seek .",
    "earlier , tuck  @xcite had proposed the idea that toy models of certain wave - structure problems could be derived by ignoring or replacing the hilbert transform , and changing to a local problem of initial - value type . in the companion paper @xcite ,",
    "such a reduction was shown to be formally possible in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "the argument is as follows .",

    "effectively , the surface has been replaced by a rigid plane , and the solution is known as the _",
    "double - body flow_. in this case , the leading - order speed is given by @xmath39 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : outline ] , the leading - order solution fails to capture the wave phenomena .",
    "in fact , the situation is much worse , and it can be argued through the study of higher - order terms in , that none of the terms , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , will contain an oscillatory component at any order .",
    "indeed , this is ogilvie s low - speed paradox  @xcite .",
    "let us take @xmath2 and @xmath27 , defined on the free surface , @xmath19 , and analytically continue the solutions to complex values of @xmath13 .",
    "relabeling @xmath42 , the system can be reduced to the following complex - valued differential equation : @xmath43{\\bar{q}}\\sim r(w ; { \\hat{{\\mathscr{h}}}}[{\\bar{\\theta } } ] ) \\quad \\text{where } \\quad { \\hat{{\\mathscr{h}}}}{\\bar{\\theta}}(w ) = { \\hat{{\\mathscr{h}}}}[{\\bar{\\theta } } ] = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{{\\bar{\\theta}}(\\varphi)}{\\varphi - w } \\ , { \\operatorname{d\\!}{}}{\\varphi}.\\ ] ] the derivation of",
    "is reviewed in appendix  [ sec : reduce ] .",
    "the idea of extending the governing system to complex values may seem odd , but the rationale can be seen _ a posteriori_.    above , we have assumed that @xmath44 lies in the upper half - plane ( an analogous derivation can be done for the lower half - plane ) .",
    "we have also introduced @xmath45 for the complexified hilbert transform , which is non - singular for @xmath44 off the real axis .",
    "the two functions , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , are known , typically in closed form , while @xmath48 may be approximated ; we will specify these quantities later . integrating the equation , and taking the limit whereby we return to the physical free surface , @xmath49",

    "there are many subtleties to the reduction process that takes the full system to the first - order problem , and then again to the integral .",
    "indeed , a rigorous explanation of why this reduction is valid forms the basis of the companion work  @xcite . for now , let us take for granted , and seek an approximation of the integral .    in the limit @xmath7 , the initial contour of @xmath53",
    "$ ] can be defomred along paths of steepest descent .",
    "once done , an asymptotic expansion of the integral is derived by consideration of dominant contributions from the endpoints , as well as any relevant saddle or critical points of the integrand . in @xcite , it was shown that the endpoint contributions would lead to a re - expansion of higher - order algebraic terms from , while the water waves were caused due to contributions _ away _ from the positive real axis .",
    "therefore @xmath54 $ ] , which only depends on the free surface values of @xmath55 , can be ignored at leading order .",
    "this subtle reduction process explains why reduced wave models ( such as the ones reviewed in @xcite ) remove or substitute alternatives for the hilbert transform .",
    "let @xmath56 be the exponentially waves that arise from the integral according to this process .",
    "the free surface will then be approximated by @xmath57 + 2 { \\operatorname{re}}({q_\\mathrm{exp}}),\\ ] ] which includes both the wave - free flow ( the square - bracketed terms ) and the surface waves .",
    "note that we are required to add both @xmath56 from and also its complex conjugate , due to an analogous argument for the analytic continuation of into the lower half - plane , and subsequent application of the schwartz reflection principle . combining these two contributions",
    "then leads to @xmath58 .",
    "let us be more concrete and provide a numerical example .",
    "suppose we return to the differential equation and , having been sufficiently convinced by the above argument , we ignore the @xmath54 $ ] contributions to @xmath48 .",
    "using the initial condition @xmath52 , the values and for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the approximation for @xmath48 , the differential equation is solved as an intial - value problem .",
    "the result , , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : outline](b ) .",
    "the agreement with the full nonlinear solution is superb , even at the moderate value of @xmath35 . in @xcite , a careful check of numerical vs. asymptotic results as @xmath7 verifies these claims properly .",
    "now we arrive at the current aims of this paper .",
    "previously in @xcite , the asymptotic approximations of the integral were made based on the general assumption that the initial contour of integration @xmath59 $ ] , could be deformed for any given body geometry , and that such a deformation would include the key critical points generating the water waves .",
    "in actuality , the topology of the steepest descent paths may be rather complicated .",
    "different body geometries yield different contributing singularities ; or perhaps for some bodies , there may be branch cuts that complicate the deformation procedure .    thus , our main goal is to demonstrate , through the use of several representative examples , the correspondence between the physical flow and the topology of steepest descent paths .",
    "the power of this approach is two - fold .",
    "first , it provides an analytical methodology for determining a wide range of wave - structure interaction problems .",
    "second , it provides an intuitive approach to visualizing the effects of changing particular geometrical properties .",
    "we will see , for example , how the complex - valued topology of a surface - piercing ship differs from that of channel flow , or how flow past a shallow angled step differs from flow past a rectangular step .",
    "this correspondence process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : outline](c ) .",
    "let us now explain how the riemann surfaces connected to the steepest descent paths are computed . a general reference for the method of steepest descents can be found in _",

    "we first re - write the integral as @xmath60 ) { \\mathrm{e}}^{p_1(\\varphi)},\\ ] ] and @xmath46 , a quantity known as the _ singulant _ , is given by , or repeated here as @xmath61 in the definition of @xmath46 , we have introduced the sign constant , @xmath62 .",
    "the constant takes the value @xmath63 for surface - piercing flows , and @xmath64 for channel flows .",
    "this distinction is necessary due to the difference in surface flow direction relative to the solid body , as explained in .",
    "the function @xmath65 is the double - body solution discussed in ",
    "[ sec : mathintro ] , and encodes the information for the geometry of the moving body .",
    "any choice for the initial point of integration , @xmath66 , is valid so long as the integral is defined ; a selection will be compensated by the numerical pre - factors associated with @xmath67 .",

    "the paths of steepest descent are given by level sets of @xmath73 , and thus the criterion for determining whether @xmath44 lies on the steepest descent path from @xmath66 is @xmath74 = { \\operatorname{im } } [ \\chi(w_0 ) ] \\quad \\text{and } \\quad { \\operatorname{re}}[\\chi(w ) ] \\leq { \\operatorname{re } } [ \\chi(w_0)].\\ ] ] the first condition ensures that @xmath44 is on a path of steepest descent or ascent ; the second ensures that it is , in fact , a path of steepest descent .    in practice , however , calculating @xmath75 for different values of @xmath44 is not necessarily straightforward , as depending on the body function , @xmath65 , @xmath46 may possess a complicated branch structure .",
    "a similar issue was encountered in the development of asymptotic solutions to the problem of thin - film rupture  @xcite . in order to explain the terminology for the branch structure ,",
    "let us return to the example ship flow of  [ sec : mathintro ] . substituting @xmath65 from into , and choosing the initial point of integration , @xmath76 , to correspond to the corner of the ship , we have @xmath77 to define a single - valued function for the above integral",
    ", we must specify the branches and branch cuts associated with the two critical points at @xmath78 .",
    "each single - valued specification of @xmath46 is called a _ branch _ ( the output or range ) , and each branch is defined on a _ riemann sheet _ , @xmath79 of the complex plane ( the input or domain ) .    however , as @xmath44 varies in the complex plane , the contour of integration may cross a branch cut ; here , the single - valued specification of @xmath46 encounters a discontinuity . for our purposes , we wish to continue the trajectory of the steepest descent contours of beyond such discontinuities . in other words ,",
    "when a branch cut is traversed , we will move onto the adjacent riemann sheet , and take the values of @xmath46 from the next branch .",
    "the collection of riemann sheets is known as the _ riemann surface _ for @xmath46 .",
    "it is this notion of a riemann surface , represented by copies of the complex plane attached to one - another , that allows us to unambiguously define a multi - valued function for @xmath46 .",

    "continuing with our ship example in , let us choose the branch cuts so as to lie along the rays of constant angle from each branch point , @xmath80 .",
    "typically , we will choose them so as to lie parallel to one of the coordinate axes .",
    "let @xmath81 be the winding number around the point @xmath82 .",
    "that is , @xmath83 marks the number of rotations associated with a given analytic continuation around the point @xmath82 , with positive and negative integers for counterclockwise and clockwise rotations , respectively .",
    "notationally , we will denote each distinct branch of @xmath46 by the pair @xmath84 , indicating the number of revolutions required in order to reach the current branch .",
    "for example , consider the surface - piercing ship with branch points at @xmath85 ( the corner ) and @xmath86 ( the stagnation point ) .",
    "three illustrative branches are labeled as @xmath87 the first , @xmath88 , is the principal branch obtained by integrating from @xmath89 to @xmath90 without crossing a branch cut .",
    "the second , @xmath91 is found by integrating from @xmath89 , then circling the stagnation point , @xmath92 , in the positive sense , and arriving at @xmath90 . the third , @xmath93 , begins from the previous branch , and then performs an additional rotation about the corner , @xmath94 .",
    "when it may be ambiguous , we use the arrow notation to clarify the order in which branch cuts are crossed .",
    "a three - dimensional cross - section of the riemann surface can be visualized by plotting @xmath95 using @xmath88 and its adjacent sheets . in general , these surfaces will self - intersect within the graphical representation but they are otherwise free of discontinuities",
    ". for similar visualizations of riemann surfaces , see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "the riemann surfaces that appear in this paper , such as the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : outline ] , are graphed from the numerical integration of @xmath46 using the trapezoid rule .",
    "in such computations , we have carefully defined the locations of the branch cuts , and implemented a numerical scheme allowing the integration path to smoothly switch between the individual branch sheets .",
    "both interactive plots of the riemann surfaces , and also the data for the contour plots appearing in this paper can be found within the electronic supplementary material .",
    "we are now ready to study the steepest descent paths associated with the integral .",
    "we have chosen to focus on three representative geometries : the previous rectangular semi - infinite ship in infinite depth [ in  [ sec : steep][sec : ship ] ] , a rectangular step in a channel [ in  [ sec : steep][sec : step ] ] , and an angled step in a channel [ in  [ sec : steep][sec : stepangle ] ] .",
    "the methods we present can be extended to cover many other classes of moving bodies , notably those for which a boundary integral formulation exists .",
    "this includes , for instance , models of an air jet stream blowing on stationary water  @xcite , flow over a submerged source or sink  @xcite , and flows past sluice gates or surf boards  @xcite .",
    "let us return to the case of flow past a semi - infinite rectangular stern .",
    "the geometry is specified by @xmath96 in with @xmath34 , and the leading - order speed is given by .",
    "our task is to approximate the integral , which involves the singulant function .",
    "the critical points in the @xmath44 or @xmath97-plane include the corner @xmath98 and the stagnation point @xmath99 , and the branch cuts from both are taken along the positive real axis .    in the integral",
    ", we would like to take the initial point of integration to be the stagnation point , @xmath100 , so as to make use of the boundary condition @xmath52 .",
    "however , because the origin is a degenerate point , it is easier to first consider the descents paths for the integral @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a small and positive number . also , it can be verified , through examination of the pre - factor @xmath67 , that the steepest descent contours will only depend on @xmath46 .",
    "below , we will use @xmath44 interchangeably with @xmath97 ( the dummy variable ) .    using the methodology outlined in  [ sec : riemann ] , we generate the riemann surface associated with @xmath46 , and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfship ] .",
    "the visualized surface is composed of the three listed branches in .",
    "however , as it turns out , in the rectangular geometry , the adjacent riemann sheets due to the corner point remain inactive , and are untouched by the relevant steepest descent paths",
    ". this will not always be the case for all geometries and through all values of the angle @xmath103 . in",
    "both the examples of a rectangular and angled step in  [ sec : steep][sec : step ] and  [ sec : steep][sec : stepangle ] , the steepest descent contours will indeed traverse onto adjacent riemann sheets .",
    "we continue to examine fig .",
    "[ fig : surfship ] , but now turn our attention to the planar projection , shown in grey , where several constant phase curves , @xmath104 , are projected down from the riemann surface .",
    "the dashed lines are constant phase lines emerging from the corner point , @xmath98 , with one set of lines , on the right , forming a homoclinic , and the other , on the left , forming an open triangular region . setting @xmath105",
    ", we find that the local emergence angles of such paths are @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "thus the homoclinic is formed by the two local angles , @xmath108 , while the triangular region is formed by the two local angles , @xmath109 .    the most important quantity to note",
    "is that along the dashed line with @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 , which indicates that the trajectory along this curve lies uphill of the point @xmath98 ( note that @xmath46 in was chosen so that @xmath112 at the corner ) .",
    "we have also plotted two steepest descent trajectories , shown thick . within the interior of the homoclinic",
    ", the steepest descent trajectory forms an arc that tends towards @xmath99 in a direction tangential to the negative real axis .",
    "exterior of the homoclinic , and to the right of the plane , the trajectory moves to @xmath113 along the dashed line with local angle @xmath114 .",
    "the dashed line , called the _ stokes line _ , marks a critical curve across which the steepest descent paths change in dramatic fashion ; it is of key importance in what follows .     for the rectangular ship geometry with @xmath34 , shown in the @xmath95 plane .",
    "the two thick contours correspond to steepest descent trajectories for an upstream ( near the stagnation point ) and downstream point on the free surface .",
    "the lower plane shows the projection of curves onto the @xmath115-plane .",
    "the surface is generated from numerical integration of @xmath46 .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angledstep ] , and the picture reveals the remarkable complexity for even this moderately simple geometry .",
    "we note that the shallow angle of the step , as compared to the rectangular case , forces certain steepest descent contours to now travel past the branch cut associated with @xmath145 , and move onto the sheet @xmath193 .",
    "the steepest descent process will go through three possible configurations , depending on the extent of which @xmath194 in lies downstream from the step .",
    "if @xmath194 has not passed the first stokes line from the corner , @xmath146 , then only the end - point contribution is derived from the steepest descent process and there are no waves .",
    "once @xmath194 passes the first stokes line intersection from the corner , a single free - surface wave is switched on  as in the rectangular case .",
    "however , once @xmath194 passes the second stokes line , a second wave is switched on .",
    "thus , for this most downstream point , we would modify to @xmath195 from the riemann surface , notice that saddle from @xmath196 lies lower than the one from @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , the second free - surface wave will be exponentially subdominant to the first .",
    "the work in this paper was inspired through three principal motivations .",
    "the first motivation was to return to the work of tulin  @xcite and tuck  @xcite , both of whom had proposed reduced models for free - surface flows with moving bodies .",
    "tulin s model relied on a strategic trigonometric substitution inspired by davies  @xcite , while tuck s model was less rigorous and more pedagogic in nature .",
    "both models were united by their dependence on simplifying or outright removing the hilbert transform , and also emphasized the importance of analytic continuation into the complex plane .",
    "both models were also incomplete ; thus the search for a complete model led to the companion work  @xcite , where a systematic reduction of the water - wave equations demonstrated why certain simplifications can be applied in the low - speed , @xmath7 , limit .",
    "there , the analysis had depended on a general steepest descent argument , attributing surface waves to saddle - point contributions . despite the relative simplicity of such arguments",
    ", the actual deformation process can be quite nontrivial , and in this paper , our objective was to demonstrate how this steepest descent analysis was performed for particular flow geometries .",
    "our second motivation was to provide a powerful and visual methodology for the study of wave - structure interactions .",
    "the method establishes a correspondence between the physical flow with the topology of the riemann surface that underlies paths of steepest descent .",
    "for instance , through the visualizations of figs .",
    "[ fig : surfship ] and [ fig : surfstep ] , we showed how to understand the effects of changing from flow past a surface - piercing ship , to flow over a step , simply by observing the associated changes in the riemann surfaces .",
    "subtle geometrical changes can also be noted : for example in fig .",
    "[ fig : angledstep ] , we changed the angle of the step , showing how the modification shifts paths of steepest descent onto previously untraveled areas of the riemann surface .    finally , our last motivation was to explore the various connections between the work here , with other research where exponential asymptotics is used to study free - surface flows .",
    "the successful application of exponential asymptotics to such problems has led to an exciting revival of classical problems in fluid mechanics  @xcite , but the methodology has always been limited by its relative complexity .",
    "there is a key simplification afforded by the study of _ gravity_-driven flow , and that is that bernoulli s equation is only first - order in its derivative .",
    "our integral methodology exploits this fact , and allows the solution to be written in the quasi - closed form , and then studied using the method of steepest descents .",
    "_ is it then possible to consider other problems where a similar visual methodology is developed ? _",
    "we are equally motivated by a need to better understand free - surface waves with the combined effects of gravity and surface tension .",
    "it is well known that in the case of gravity - capillary flows , the equivalent exponential asymptotics analysis is a great deal more complicated @xcite .",
    "the difficulty with the inclusion of surface tension is that bernoulli s equation in becomes of second order ( due to the surface curvature terms ) , so the associated equations are not so easily studied using the method of steepest descents .",
    "similarly , the study of time - dependent or three - dimensional problems using exponential asymptotics is still very much in its infancy @xcite .",
    "_ what other geometries can be studied using this approach ? _ the reader may remark that , in reality , ships or channel topographies may not be piecewise - linear in shape as they are considered here . in our work ,",
    "the generation of waves is attributed to critical points in the geometry ( corners or stagnation points ) , but surely a smooth object will still create a wave pattern ! in fact , our analysis does not stipulate that the body must contain singularities _ par se _ , but rather the analytic continuation of @xmath2 and @xmath27 .",
    "consider , for example , the replacement of the bottom topography in fig .",
    "[ formstep ] by any streamline of the flow above the step .",
    "the free - surface waves must necessarily remain the same , and in fact , the steepest decents analysis previously applied will _ still _ apply , as the ( now - hidden ) complex singularities of the step remain in place .",
    "there is no contradiction .",
    "our work here also opens the possibility of studying flows past bodies with singularities weaker than the branch points found in the ship and step flows . in a forthcoming paper , we will study flows past bodies with singularities in the _ curvature _ ( rather than the angle ) , such as for the bulbous sterns considered in @xcite .",
