    "<S> we investigate the two - dimensional hubbard model on the triangular lattice with anisotropic hopping integrals at half filling . by means of a self - energy functional approach , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how stable the non - magnetic state is against magnetically ordered states in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we present the zero - temperature phase diagram , where the normal metallic state competes with magnetically ordered states with @xmath0 and @xmath1 structures . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a non - magnetic mott insulating state is not realized as the ground state , in the present framework , but as a meta - stable state near the magnetically ordered phase with @xmath1 structure .    </S>",
    "<S> geometrical frustration in strongly correlated electron systems has attracted current interest . </S>",
    "<S> one of the typical examples is an organic material @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath3cu@xmath3(cn)@xmath4 with the triangular lattice structure , where a non - magnetic insulating state is realized down to low temperatures @xmath532mk@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that a novel spin - liquid insulating state is stable against magnetically ordered states , which stimulates further theoretical investigations on frustrated electron systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although a non - magnetic insulating state was shown to be a probable candidate for the ground state of the hubbard model on the triangular lattice @xcite , it has not been discussed how this state competes with an antiferromagnetic insulating state with @xmath6 spin structure ( @xmath6-afi ) expected naively . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was claimed that the @xmath6-afi state is , instead of the nonmagnetic insulating state , stabilized in the strong coupling regime by means of variational monte carlo ( vmc ) simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this method may not deal with non - local correlations properly , which should be important in the two - dimensional frustrated systems . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is highly desirable to deal with intersite correlations as well as onsite correlations on an equal footing in order to clarify the ground - state properties of the frustrated systems </S>",
    "<S> .    motivated by this , we study the two - dimensional half - filled hubbard model with geometrical frustration . </S>",
    "<S> the model hamiltonian is given by @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the parameter - matrix of the one - particle ( two - particles ) term , where @xmath11 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath12 at site @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the number operator . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath15 is the nearest - neighbor ( second nearest - neighbor ) hopping , which is schematically shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_original_model ] ( a ) , and @xmath16 the on - site coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a sketch of the square lattice with specific diagonal hopping in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_original_model ] ( b ) , which is topologically equivalent to the triangular lattice with anisotropic hopping . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath17 , the system is equivalent to the hubbard model on the triangular lattice . in the following , we set @xmath18 as the energy unit .    to study the ground - state properties of the system , we make use of a self - energy functional approach ( sfa ) , which is based on the luttinger - ward variational principle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it provides us with a non - perturbative treatment of strong correlations , and an efficient and tractable way to investigate the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) with and without symmetry breaking @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an advantage in this method is to take into account intersite correlations as well as local electron correlations on an equal footing , which enables us to discuss the competition between the nonmagnetic insulating state and the magnetically ordered states .     </S>",
    "<S> sketch of the structure of the model hamiltonian ( a topologically equivalent structure of the model ) . ]    in this method , the ground potential @xmath19 is given as a function of a _ reference _ self - energy @xmath20 , @xmath21&=&\\omega({\\bf t^\\prime } )      + { \\rm tr}\\ln      \\left\\{-\\left[\\omega+\\mu-{\\bf t}-{\\boldsymbol \\sigma } ( { \\bf t^\\prime})\\right]^{-1}\\right\\ }      -{\\rm tr}\\ln      \\left\\{-\\left[\\omega+\\mu-{\\bf t}'-{\\boldsymbol \\sigma } ( { \\bf t^\\prime})\\right]^{-1}\\right\\ } , \\label{eq_twod_omega_sfa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the ground potential for a reference system with the hamiltonian @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the hamiltonian of the reference system is defined by the substitution of the parameter - matrix @xmath24 for @xmath9 in the original hubbard hamiltonian , where we should keep @xmath10 unchanged . the variational condition @xmath25/\\partial { \\bf t}'=0 $ ] provides us with an approximate self - energy which properly describes physical properties of the original model . </S>",
    "<S> when one applies the sfa to the present system , a cluster anderson impurity model is one of the most appropriate reference systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) sums up sites ( clusters ) in the cluster ( the whole lattice ) and @xmath29 are variational parameters . </S>",

    "<S> in this study , we mainly discuss the triangular lattice , @xmath17 . in the following , to investigate the mit of the half - filled hubbard model , we examine a free energy @xmath36 with an additional variational condition @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the chemical potential and @xmath39 is the total number of electrons .     lattice structure for two-(three-)site clusters , which are represented by rectangles ( triangles ) . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    before addressing a magnetic instability , we first consider the zero - temperature properties in the paramagnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> this might be important at very low temperatures since magnetically ordered states become unstable in two dimensions . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use a two - site cluster with @xmath44 as a reference system , which is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_ref_model ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained free energy is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_free_energy ] ( a ) . in the small @xmath16 region ( @xmath45 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find one stationary point with a large @xmath40 , which should represent the paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) state . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in @xmath16 gradually changes the stationary point and decreases its variational parameter @xmath40 , which implies that the heavy quasi - particle state is realized in the case @xmath45 . on the other hand , the paramagnetic insulating ( pi ) state appears in the strong coupling region ( @xmath46 ) , which is shown as another stationary point in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these two phases compete with each other and a first - order mit between the pi and the pm states occurs around @xmath47 as far as the paramagnetic states are concerned .    </S>",
    "<S> however , this result does not necessarily imply that the pi state is stable against magnetically ordered states at zero temperature . to make this clear , we discuss the magnetic instability in the system . </S>",
    "<S> potential candidates for the ordered states are the ( @xmath48)-antiferromagnetic insulating ( afi ) state and the @xmath6-afi state . by using two kinds of the reference systems illustrated in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_ref_model ] ( b ) and ( d ) , we obtain the free energies for paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_free_energy ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the pm state is stable in the small @xmath16 region . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it is found that in the strong coupling limit , the @xmath6-afi state is stabilized , which is consistent with the results for the heisenberg model . at @xmath49 , </S>",
    "<S> the free energies for these states cross each other , suggesting the first - order mit accompanied by symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the non - magnetic insulating state is no longer realized as the ground state within the present approach . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless in the pm region ( @xmath50 ) , the non - magnetic insulating state exists as a meta - stable state . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> if the interacting system is adiabatically cooled down , the meta - stable non - magnetic insulating state could emerge down to zero temperature .    by performing sfa calculations with several values of @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the ground - state phase diagram of the half - filled hubbard model , which is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_phase ] . </S>",
    "<S> the pm state is stable in the weakly correlated region with @xmath52 . in the strongly correlated region , </S>",
    "<S> the ( @xmath53)-afi state competes with the @xmath6-afi state and the phase transition occurs at @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with those obtained by the vmc calculations @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_phase ] , we show the region where the non - magnetic insulating state is not realized as the ground state , but appears as a meta - stable state .    in summary , we have investigated the half - filled hubbard model on the triangular lattice with anisotropic hopping integrals by means of a self - energy functional approach . </S>",
    "<S> we have clarified how the normal metallic state competes with the magnetically ordered states with @xmath0 and @xmath1 structures . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath55 , another type of magnetically ordered state with an incommensurate wave vector @xmath56 might be also possible @xcite , which has not been addressed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it remains an important problem to explore the stability of such ordered states , which is now under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been suggested that in the square - lattice model with next - nearest hopping , which is another important frustrated system slightly different from the present one , the collinear ordered phase with @xmath57 or @xmath58 is stabilized for large frustration@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> comprehensive investigations including such frustrated systems are important , which are left for the future study .     </S>",
