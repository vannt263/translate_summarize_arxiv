    "in situ spacecraft measurements indicate that solar - wind plasma deviates significantly from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "ions exhibit distinct non - thermal kinetic features , such as proton core temperature anisotropy , proton beams , and the preferential heating and acceleration ( with respect to the protons ) of alpha particles and minor ions @xcite .",
    "all these non - thermal features can be a source of kinetic instabilities , such as the alfvn / ion - cyclotron ( a / ic ) , mirror - mode , fast - magnetosonic / whistler ( fm / w ) , and oblique firehose ( fh ) instabilities .    during the transit of the ions from the sun to a heliospheric distance  @xmath6 of 1 au",
    ", the adiabatic expansion of the solar wind tends to drive a temperature anisotropy of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 refer to the directions parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "ions can be imparted with the opposite sense of temperature anisotropy by heating from either the dissipation of low - frequency turbulence @xcite or resonant cyclotron interactions with high - frequency  a / ic waves  @xcite .",
    "_ wind _ measurements at 1 au reveal that the temperature anisotropy of protons and alpha particles can be a source for a / ic , mirror - mode , fm / w , and oblique fh instabilities @xcite .",
    "helios _ measurements near 0.3 au show that the velocity distribution functions of the proton core in fast solar wind regions are close to marginal stability for the a / ic instability @xcite .    in situ measurements in the inner heliosphere",
    "indicate that alpha particles can be accelerated up to the local alfvn speed in the proton frame @xcite . however , the differential speed between alpha particles and protons rarely exceeds the local alfvn speed , because super - alfvnic alpha - particle beams lead to the excitation of a / ic and fm / w waves @xcite , and the amplified waves can decelerate the alpha particles @xcite .",
    "collisions in the solar wind tend to equilibrate the plasma to a state far below the instability thresholds .",
    "nevertheless , the collisionally regulated plasma can still excite waves if it approaches a threshold for instabilities with sufficiently high growth rates .",
    "some previous studies have focused on instabilities driven by either an alpha - particle temperature anisotropy @xmath10 or a non - zero average alpha - particle velocity @xmath11 in the proton rest frame .",
    "however , other studies have shown that temperature anisotropy modifies the @xmath11 threholds of the a / ic and fm / w instabilities , while differential flow modifies the  @xmath12 thresholds of these instabilities @xcite .",
    "our goal in this letter is thus to treat @xmath11 and @xmath12 on an equal footing and , by analyzing data from the _ wind _ spacecraft , to determine whether the linear a / ic and fm / w instabilities provide a good explanation for the limits on @xmath11 and @xmath13 that are observed in the solar wind .",
    "the measurements of ion parameters used in this study were derived from in situ data from the _ wind _ spacecraft s faraday cups @xcite .",
    "this instrument produces an ion spectrum ( i.e. , a distribution of ion speeds projected along various axes ) about once every ninety seconds .",
    "the bulk parameters ( e.g. , density , flow velocity , and temperature ) of the protons and alpha particles can be deduced from each spectrum by fitting a model velocity distribution function ( vdf ) for each species @xcite .",
    "perpendicular and parallel temperature components can be separated using measurements of the local magnetic field , which are available from _ wind _ s magnetic field investigation @xcite .    for this study",
    ", we used the dataset of ion parameters produced by ( * ? ? ? * chapter 4 ) , who processed nearly @xmath14-million _ wind _ ion spectra ( i.e. , all spectra from the spacecraft s launch in late-1994 through mid-2010 ) with a fully - revised fitting code .",
    "these revisions dramatically improved the code s analysis of temperature anisotropy and differential flow ( especially during periods of significant fluctuations in the background magnetic field ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , only about @xmath15-million of the spectra processed were included in the final dataset due to two sets of selection requirements .",
    "first , a spectrum needed to have been measured at a time when _ wind _ was well outside the earth s bow shock ( i.e. , actually in the solar wind ) .",
    "the spacecraft , especially during the early part of its mission , spent significant amounts of time exploring the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "second , the fit results had to be of high quality as gauged by reduced-@xmath16 , uncertainty in the fit parameters , and other metrics .",
    "the most frequent cause for this second criterion not being met was low alpha - particle signal ( from , e.g. , low densities or high temperatures ) .",
    "to study the instabilities resulting from a combination of relative drift and temperature anisotropy of alpha particles we restrict our data analysis to solar - wind intervals in which @xmath17 .",
    "the selected interval of @xmath18 represents the typical range of variation of the ratio alpha - to - proton temperature in weakly collisional solar wind streams @xcite .",
    "also , our selection is consistent with the theoretical value of @xmath19 used below to determine the threshold values for the drift - anisotropy instabilities .    using kennel & wong s ( @xcite ) expression for the growth rate @xmath20 of weakly growing waves",
    ", @xcite derived approximate analytic expressions for the instability thresholds of a / ic and fm / w waves taking into account both the alpha - proton drift and alpha - particle temperature anisotropy . for this calculation , they assumed that the wavevector  @xmath21 is parallel to the background magnetic field  @xmath22 and took the alpha - particles ( protons ) to have a bi - maxwellian ( maxwellian ) distribution .",
    "we note at this point that some authors refer to the parallel fm / w instability as the _ parallel firehose instability_.",
    "@xcite validated their analytic results by comparing them to numerical solutions of the hot - plasma dispersion relation .",
    "for the parameters we consider in this letter the minimum value of @xmath11 needed to excite the a / ic instability is given by ( see @xcite for further details )    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the parallel thermal speed and @xmath25 the mass per particle of species @xmath26 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath11 needed to excite the parallel fm / w instability is @xmath27 the value of the dimensionless quantity  @xmath28 in these equations depends very weakly upon the alpha - to - proton density ratio  @xmath29 and the exact definition of the instability threshold . in this letter , we use the values of  @xmath28 for which equations ( [ eq : umin ] ) and ( [ eq : ufmw ] ) correspond to growth rates of @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the proton cyclotron frequency ) in a plasma with  @xmath32 .",
    "these values are @xmath33 in equation  ( [ eq : umin ] ) and @xmath34 in equation  ( [ eq : ufmw ] )  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these approximate analytic instability thresholds , we use numerical solutions of the hot - plasma dispersion relation to find contours in different parameter planes ( e.g. , the @xmath35 plane ) corresponding to various values of the maximum a / ic or fm / w growth rate . to solve the linear dispersion relation we used the following parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the speed of light .",
    "we plot some of these contours in the figures below . as shown by @xcite , equations  ( [ eq : umin ] ) and ( [ eq : ufmw ] ) correspond closely to the numerical contours with @xmath42 , except for the portion of the analytic curve for @xmath43 at small @xmath44 in figure  [ fig.1 ] where @xmath43 decreases as @xmath44 decreases , which is not reproduced in the numerical solutions .",
    "plane , where @xmath11 is the alpha - proton drift speed and @xmath45 is the parallel alpha - particle thermal speed .",
    "the number of measurements in each bin is shown in the color bars on the right .",
    "the top panel is the subset of the data in which @xmath46 , and the bottom panel is the subset of the data in which @xmath47 .",
    "the short - dashed lines are plots of the a / ic instability threshold ( equation  ( [ eq : umin ] ) ) with @xmath48 ( top panel ) and @xmath49 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the long - dash ( solid ) line corresponds to parameter combinations for which the maximum a / ic growth rate is @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , where again @xmath52 in the top panel and @xmath53 in the bottom panel . ]    in figure  [ fig.1 ] , we compare the theoretical instability threshold of the a / ic wave with the subsets of the _ wind _ measurements in which @xmath54 ( top panel ) and @xmath55 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "we also plot curves corresponding to maximum a / ic growth rates of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . when @xmath46 , the large majority of the data is constrained by the analytic threshold in equation  ( [ eq : umin ] ) , corresponding to a maximum a / ic growth rate of @xmath58 . when @xmath59 , the large majority of the data are constrained to lie below the curve corresponding to a maximum a / ic growth rate of @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , the curves corresponding to constant maximum growth rates have approximately the same slope as the contours of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the _ wind _ data at @xmath60 .",
    "plane , where @xmath11 is the alpha - proton drift speed and @xmath45 is the parallel alpha - particle thermal speed .",
    "the number of measurements in each bin is shown in the color bars on the right .",
    "the top panel is the subset of the data in which @xmath61 , and the bottom panel is the subset of the data in which @xmath62 .",
    "the short - dashed lines are plots of the fm / w instability threshold ( equation  ( [ eq : umin ] ) ) with @xmath63 ( top panel ) and @xmath64 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the long - dash ( solid ) line correpsonds to parameter combinations for which the maximum fm / w growth rate is @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , where again @xmath65 in the top panel and @xmath66 in the bottom panel . ]    in figure  [ fig.2 ] , we plot the instability threshold of the fm / w wave from equation  ( [ eq : ufmw ] ) along with the subsets of the _ wind _ data in which @xmath67 ( top panel ) and @xmath68 ( bottom panel )",
    ". we also plot curves corresponding to maximum fm / w growth rates of @xmath69 and @xmath57 . when @xmath67 , the majority of the data have values of @xmath11 smaller than the threshold value @xmath70 in equation  ( [ eq : ufmw ] ) . when @xmath68 , a small fraction of the data satisfies @xmath71 , but the majority of the data is constrained to lie below the curve corresponing to @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , the curves of constant maximum growth rates and the contours of the pdf at @xmath60 have similar slopes .     for the mirror - mode instability with @xmath72 when @xmath73 ( diamonds ) and @xmath74 ( squares ) .",
    "isocontours of constant maximum growth rate @xmath20 for the oblique fh mode with @xmath72 , when @xmath75 ( filled dots ) and @xmath76 ( asterisks ) . ]",
    "we note that the constant-@xmath20 contours for the parallel a / ic and fm / w instability thresholds do not coincide with the contours of the data distribution at small @xmath44 in figures  [ fig.1 ] and  [ fig.2 ] , where the upper bound on @xmath11 is approximately proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "the reason for this upper bound on  @xmath11 at small  @xmath44 is not clear from our analysis .",
    "two other instabilities driven by pressure anisotropies are the mirror - mode and the oblique fh instabilities @xcite .",
    "if the temperature anisotropy crosses the instability threshold of the mirror - mode or the oblique fh instability , the unstable mode shows maximum growth rate at a non - vanishing angle between the wavevector @xmath78 and the background magnetic field @xmath79 .",
    "the frequencies of these oblique instabilities in the proton frame are purely imaginary if @xmath80 , and the real parts of the frequencies slowly increase with increasing @xmath81 . in figure  [ fig.3 ]",
    "we plot numerically determined isocontours of constant maximum growth rates @xmath20 for both the mirror - mode instability and the oblique fh instability in the @xmath82-@xmath83 plane for two different values of @xmath12 .",
    "the points represent parameter combinations for which the particular mode has @xmath50 at one wavevector only and has lower @xmath20 at all other wavevectors .",
    "both the analytical thresholds and the isocontours with @xmath50 for the ai / c and fm / w instabilities are much closer to the data distribution in parameter space than the isocontours for the oblique instabilities ( compare figure  [ fig.3 ] to figures  [ fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the threshold of the mirror - mode instability hardly depends on the value of @xmath11 , and the slopes of the lines in figure  [ fig.3 ] are very different from the slopes of the outer contours of the data distribution plotted in figures  [ fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the oblique instabilities seem not to limit the alpha temperature anisotropy in the presence of alpha drift in our cases .    , and ( c ) @xmath84 are given by the color bars on the right .",
    "the upper red solid line ( red dashed line ) represents parameter values for which the maximum growth rate of the mirror - mode ( a / ic ) instability is @xmath85 .",
    "the lower black solid line ( black dashed line ) represents parameter values for which the maximum growth rate of the oblique fh ( fm / w ) instability is @xmath86 . ]",
    "we now turn to a consideration of the preferential heating of alpha particles near the thresholds of the a / ic and fm / w instabilities . for this part of our analysis ,",
    "we select all data points from the full _ wind _ data set between 1994 and mid-2010 for which @xmath87 .",
    "in figure  [ fig.4 ] we order the data as a function of @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 ) .",
    "the curves in figure  [ fig.4 ] are contours of constant maximum growth rate @xmath91 using the analytical fitting formula ( 8) of @xcite assuming isotropic proton temperature , @xmath92 and equal parallel thermal speeds of alpha particles and protons .",
    "the curves we plot thus serve primarily to indicate the vicinity of the many different growth - rate contours that would apply to this data set . in the top panel of figure  [ fig.4 ] , we plot the data distribution as a function of @xmath93 and @xmath12 . in the panels ( b ) and",
    "( c ) of figure  [ fig.4 ] , we plot the average value of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "these plots show that the ratio @xmath94 ( @xmath1 ) is relatively higher near the threshold of the a / ic ( fm / w ) instability than elsewhere in the ( @xmath88@xmath89 ) plane .",
    "this observational finding for alpha particles , to the best of our knowledge , has not been reported before .",
    "however , @xcite reported a similar finding for protons .",
    "although we do not focus on the origin of the enhanced alpha - particle temperatures in this study , we note that cyclotron - heating and stochastic - heating models can explain the preferential heating of alpha particles to temperatures exceeding the proton temperature  @xcite .",
    "by analyzing _ wind _ measurements of solar - wind streams , we find that the alpha - particle differential flow is limited to values comparable to the instability thresholds of a / ic and fm / w waves .",
    "importantly , these thresholds depend upon the temperature anisotropy of the alpha particles .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath81 thresholds of beam instabilities in isotropic - temperature plasmas , which are  @xmath96 , the thresholds of the a / ic and fm / w instabilities can be significantly smaller than  @xmath97 when @xmath98 and when @xmath60 .",
    "our findings support previous suggestions that a / ic and fm / w instabilities limit the alpha - particle differential flow in the solar wind .",
    "our results also emphasize the importance of treating differential flow and temperature anisotropy on an equal footing when @xmath99 , since these properties are of comparable importance for these instabilities .    within the subset of the data in which  @xmath100",
    ", we find strong preferential heating of alpha particles relative to protons for conditions under which the a / ic and fm / w instabilities occur .",
    "when the plasma is near the threshold of the a / ic instability , @xmath101 is unusually large . on the other hand ,",
    "when the plasma is near the threshold of the fm / w instability , @xmath102 is unusually large .",
    "this suggests that exceptionally strong perpendicular ( parallel ) heating is the reason why , in a small fraction of the small-@xmath11 data , alpha - particles are in the a / ic - unstable ( fm / w - unstable ) region of parameter space ."
