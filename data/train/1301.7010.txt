    "lately , outstanding achievements have been made in development of a novel class of uncooled microbolometer ir focal plane arrays ( fpas ) , the ones based on si - on - insulator diodes as temperature sensors , whose format has reached 2 megapixels with a noise equivalent temperature difference ( netd ) of 60 mk at the frame rate of 15 hz and the f - number of 1 ; the same group has also demonstrated a vga fpa with outstanding netd of 21 mk ( at f/1 , 30 hz ) [ see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and earlier articles cited therein ] .",
    "this success , as well as previous achievements in this field @xcite , stimulates search for simple cmos compatible technological solutions based on diode bolometers which would be suitable for mass production of ir fpas with low cost and netd figures sufficient for many civil applications @xcite .",
    "one of such solutions consists in utilization of metal / poly - si schottky barriers for formation of sets of temperature sensors on bolometer membranes @xcite .",
    "schottky barrier bolometer arrays seem to be first proposed theoretically for very sensitive cooled bolometers @xcite . in this article ,",
    "nickel silicide schottky diodes formed on polycrystalline si@xmath0p@xmath1 films are proposed as thermosensitive elements of monolithic uncooled microbolometer ir fpas . the possibility of integration of technological process of the silicide based schottky diode structure formation into the standard cmos technology of vlsi manufacturing @xcite as well as the possibility of cascade connection of schottky diodes to increase the temperature sensitivity of bolometer elements of fpa and the use of layers of the diode structures as absorbing coatings in bolometers are advantages of these structures .",
    "schottky barriers were formed on commercial single - crystalline cz silicon wafers ( @xmath6 cm , ( 100 ) , @xmath7-type ) coated by a @xmath4600 nm thick layer of sio@xmath3 formed by thermal oxidation and a @xmath4180 nm thick layer of pyrolytic si@xmath2n@xmath8 ( the dielectric layers simulated a design of the supporting membranes of the previously tested bolometer cells @xcite ) .",
    "films of polycrystalline si@xmath0p@xmath1 with the thicknesses of @xmath4150 nm were deposited by thermal decomposition of monosilane at the substrate temperature @xmath9 ; then they were doped by phosphorus by ion implantation ( @xmath10=35kev ) to the dose of @xmath11@xmath12 and annealed at 700 for 30  min . after wafer cleaning in a boiling ammonia - peroxide mixture solution ( nh@xmath8oh : h@xmath3o@xmath3:h@xmath3o=1:1:4 , 10  min ) and surface hydrogenation ( hf : h@xmath3o=1:10 , 30  sec at room temperature ) , ni - silicide / poly - si schottky diodes were formed by thermal deposition of a nickel film ( @xmath445 nm thick , @xmath13k , the residual gas pressure @xmath14torr ) from a tungsten crucible followed by annealing at 400 in nitrogen for 30  min .",
    "al contacts to poly - si were formed by thermal deposition from tungsten crucible in vacuum ( @xmath15torr , @xmath13k ) and annealing at 450 in nitrogen for 15  min . aluminium contacts to the structure top",
    "were deposited in the same way but without annealing .",
    "golden wires were welded to the contact pads .",
    "structural perfectness and chemical composition of the layers were explored by means of transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "test elements for electrical measurements were formed by contact lithography and had the sizes of @xmath16 mm .",
    "_ i  v _ characteristics of the schottky diodes were measured in darkness at different temperatures varied in the range from 20 to 70 and at the temperature of 80k .",
    "photovoltage ( @xmath17 ) spectra were obtained as described in ref.@xcite ; for each photon energy ( @xmath18 ) the photoresponse value @xmath17 was normalised to the number of incident photons .",
    "uncoated satellites were used for measurement of sheet resistance ( @xmath19 ) of the poly - si films .",
    "the wsxm software @xcite was used for tem image processing .",
    "a typical tem micrograph of the resultant structure ( fig.[fig : tem ] ) represents images of polycrystalline ni silicide and polysilicon layers between si@xmath2n@xmath8 and al films .",
    "the ni silicide film is seen to be composed by a number of phases : at least two phases with the grains close in sizes and comparable volume fractions are distinctly observed by tem .",
    "bright inclusions are also observed at ni - silicide / poly - si interface ; we presumably interpret them as residual silicon oxide particles .",
    "it is also seen in fig.[fig : tem ] that after formation of the ni - silicide / poly - si film , the average thicknesses of the ni silicide and poly - si layers became 60 and 135  nm , respectively .",
    "using the mass conservation law this allows us to estimate the density of the silicide film as @xmath47 g/@xmath20 ( we adopt the density of poly - si to be 2.33 g/@xmath20 and the density of the initial poly - ni film to be 8.9 g/@xmath20 ) .",
    "this in turn allows us to roughly evaluate the composition of the silicide layer ( the required densities of ni silicides can be found , e.g. , in refs.@xcite ) .",
    "if we postulate that the silicide film consists of only two phases , as it is stated in ref.@xcite , then they might be ni@xmath3si and nisi ( the process temperature did not exceed 450 and mainly was 400 or lower ; it is known however that nisi@xmath3or slightly more silicon rich compound @xcite , according to ref .",
    ", ni@xmath21si@xmath22forms at @xmath23 ( or even @xmath24 @xcite ) , whereas nisi and ni@xmath3si form at @xmath25 and 200 , respectively ; according to ref.@xcite , appearance of these two low - temperature phases of ni silicides after annealing in vacuum would evidence that the original ni film has been completely ( or nearly completely ) consumed by the growing ni@xmath3si phase).@xmath26 in this case the volume fraction of ni@xmath3si : nisi@xmath2785:15 ( taking into account all uncertainties , the maximum estimate yields 100% of ni@xmath3si ) ; the mass fraction of ni@xmath3si exceeds 88% .",
    "this obviously contradicts our tem observations and makes us assume the presence of the heaviest of the ni silicides , ni@xmath2si @xcite , which also may form at low temperatures , especially taking into account the possible presence of oxygen in the metal film that , according to refs.@xcite , impedes diffusion of ni atoms to ni / ni@xmath3si interface and , in our opinion , may result in simultaneous formation of ni@xmath3si and ni@xmath2si phases in the silicide film .",
    "if our assumption is true the silicide film might be composed , by a rough estimate , by 20 to 40% of ni@xmath2si , 30 to 60% of ni@xmath3si and 10 to 30% of nisi in respective proportions to give a total of 100% of the silicide film volume .",
    "the lightest ( the least dense ) silicide phase having a si - rich stoechiometry ( disilicide ) may also be available in the form of a thin diffusion layer at the ni - silicide / poly - si interface ( this does not contradict our observations ) @xcite ; it may affect the barrier height of the whole silicide layer , however @xcite .",
    "@xmath28@xmath29 characteristics of the structures ( fig.[fig : i - v-300k]a , b ) with low - resistance poly - si ( @xmath30 ) , which forms in our process , manifest a diode behavior with the rectification ratios changing from @xmath4100 to @xmath420 for the temperature varied from 22 to 70 ( fig.[fig : i - v-300k]c ) . at liquid nitrogen temperature",
    "the rectification becomes more pronounced and exceeds 1000 at biases exceeding 2  v ( fig.[fig : i - v-80k ] ) .",
    "it should be noticed that at forward biasing the negative lead was set on the silicide top contact pad whereas the positive one was set on the contact pad to the polysilicon film .",
    "photo - emf spectra obtained at 300 and 80k ( fig.[fig : emf ] ) demonstrate photoresponse for photons with energies greater and less than the si bandgap width ( @xmath31 ) as well as the presence of a number of potential barriers in the diode film .",
    "room temperature measurements with and without a silicon filter have revealed the only barrier with the height @xmath32ev ( remark that the negative pole of the photodiode was on the contact pad to the silicide when the diode was illuminated by the white light ) .",
    "a richer collection of barriers has been revealed at 80k .",
    "the highest one nearly coincides in energy with @xmath31 ( @xmath33ev with 95% confidence limits of 1.08 and 1.14ev ) .",
    "a lower one @xmath34 ( with the 95% confidence limits of 0.66 and 0.78ev ) is close to the values ascribed in the literature to all ni silicide barriers with @xmath35-type si @xcite ( equality of barrier heights of all nickel silicides was explained by the presence of similar diffusion layers in all nickel - silicide / silicon interfaces @xcite ) .",
    "estimation of the lowest one yields a figure of @xmath36ev ( the 95% confidence band is from 0.48 to 0.54ev ) ; a barrier of this height , to our knowledge , has never been connected with a ni - silicide / si transition in the literature.@xmath37 however , we attribute all the above barriers to the ni - silicide / poly - si interface .",
    "our reasoning is as follows .",
    "the band structure of a polysilicon film is known to be spatially inhomogeneous : a strong potential relief is associated with grain boundaries @xcite . in @xmath35-si , even in the heavily doped @xmath38 one , there may exist depleted or even @xmath7-type spatial domains @xcite which , on the one hand , as a result of band - to - band transitions may be sources of electron - hole pairs which , in turn , are separated by the potential relief and generate the photo - emf of the observed polarity because , despite that the potential peaks should be more or less symmetrical and the electron - hole pairs should arise with close likelihoods on both their slopes , a part of electrons escapes from the si film accumulating in silicide whereas holes are localized at the grain boundaries .",
    "this process may give rise to the photovoltage under irradiation by photons with energies @xmath39 .",
    "in addition to charge separation on opposite sides of the film , this process also increases the potential relief . on the other hand",
    ", grain boundaries may serve as potential barriers for electrons localized in @xmath38-si grains segregating them from the ni - silicide film and producing the photo - emf of the observed polarity due to electron injection into the silicide under the effect of photons with @xmath40 . @xmath38-si potential valleys adjoining the ni - silicide film form ohmic contacts .",
    "this argumentation explains the presence of the only barrier @xmath41 detected at room temperature as well as the observed polarity of both the resultant photovoltage and the forward current .",
    "a model of processes taking place at liquid nitrogen temperature is some more tricky . as it follows from the @xmath28@xmath29 characteristics ( fig.[fig : i - v-80k ] ) , the free electrons are partially frozen out in the structure and the fermi level moves down that increases the barriers for electron photoinjection into the silicide film .",
    "it makes @xmath41 move to the right in energy to appear in the photovoltage spectra as @xmath42 .",
    "two processes can be mixed in this conditions , band - to - band transition with separation of electron - hole pairs and electron injection into the silicide over the potential barrier , both generating photo - emf . in addition",
    ", a reduction of @xmath35 may increase barriers at the interface @xcite ; a usual ni - silicide barrier ( @xmath43  ev ) may be completely restored at some domains or be still reduced ( @xmath44  ev ) at different places . hole injection into the silicide layer from polysilicon grain boundaries may become more probable over reduced barriers to holes .",
    "this statement finds confirmation in the spectra plotted in fig.[fig : emf+ir ] which have been obtained under irradiation of a diode by a wide - band ir radiation of a tungsten bulb filtered by a polished si wafer [ @xmath45 ) ] .",
    "it is seen in the spectra that the higher the power density of the incident radiation on the sample , the stronger the curves bow in the high - energy part of the graph and the less values of the photo - emf are detected .",
    "it may be caused by injection of holes from potential wells at grain boundaries of poly - si into the silicide film because of additional wide - band ir lighting of the sample resulting in charge reduction of both the silicide and polysilicon layers .",
    "thus , a set of competing processes becomes possible at 80k .",
    "non - uniformity of the spatial potential throughout the ni - silicide / poly - si interface may locally act in favour of one of these competing processes . as a consequence , impact of several barriers",
    "is observed in the photoresponse spectra in the order of magnitude of contribution of processes associated with them to the resultant photo - emf in different spectral ranges .",
    "investigating the temperature dependences of the @xmath28@xmath29 characteristics close and above the room temperature we have found the thermal sensitivity of the diodes to be sufficiently high to consider them as a potential elements of uncooled bolometers .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) in fig.[fig : tsc - i ] demonstrate temperature dependences of the forward and reverse currents of the diodes @xmath28 for fixed ( and stabilized ) voltages @xmath46 .",
    "temperature coefficient of the sensor current tcs@xmath47/{\\rm d}t$ ] , where @xmath48 , derived from the graphs presented in the panels ( a ) and ( b ) as a function of bias voltage ( fig.[fig : tsc - i]c ) vary from @xmath49 to @xmath50%/ for the forward bias and remains nearly constant around 2.5%/ for the reverse bias .",
    "notice that at small values of the forward bias , tcs is positive but rapidly drops with the growth of the absolute bias and equals 0 at @xmath51v .",
    "we think that the negative tcs may result from the metallic behavior of the poly - si film as a function of temperature .",
    "temperature dependences of the voltage drop across the diode @xmath46 for fixed ( and stabilized ) forward and reverse currents @xmath28 are shown in fig.[fig : tsc - u]a , b .",
    "the temperature coefficient of voltage tcs ( @xmath52 ) derived from the graphs depicted in fig.[fig : tsc - u]a , b ( the curves in the panel ( b ) are linearized over an interval from 20 to 60 ) vary from 0.3 to 0.6%/ for forward biasing and from @xmath53 to @xmath54%/ for reverse biasing ( fig.[fig : tsc - u]c , d ) .",
    "as of now , we foresee two ways of improvement of electrical properties of the structure .",
    "the first of them consists in modification of the schottky barrier formation process proposed in ref.@xcite which enables production of poly - si / ni - polycide schottky diodes with rectification ratios as high as @xmath55 .",
    "the other possibility is to replace poly - si by @xmath56-si : h and to apply the metal induced crystallization to form diodes nearly as perfect as those produces on the basis of single - crystalline si @xcite .",
    "each of these alternatives in principle could enable the development of high - performance monolithic schottky - diode microbolometer ir fpas.@xmath57",
    "in summary , nickel silicide schottky diodes formed on polycrystalline si@xmath0p@xmath1 films are proposed as temperature sensors of monolithic uncooled microbolometer ir focal plane arrays . structure and chemical composition of the schottky diodes",
    "have been examined by tem .",
    "the ni silicide has been identified as multi - phase mixture composed by 20 to 40% of ni@xmath2si , 30 to 60% of ni@xmath3si and 10 to 30% of nisi with probable minor content of nisi@xmath3 at the silicide / poly - si interface .",
    "@xmath28@xmath29 characteristics of the diodes studied at different temperatures demonstrate the rectification ratios varying from @xmath420 to @xmath4100 when the temperature changes from 70 to 22 and exceeding 1000 at 80k .",
    "a barrier of @xmath5  ev has been found to control the photovoltage spectra at room temperature .",
    "three barriers with approximate heights from 1.08 to 1.14ev , from 0.66 to 0.78 and from 0.48 to 0.54 ev have been observed in photo - emf spectra at 80k and associated with the ni - silicide / poly - si interface .",
