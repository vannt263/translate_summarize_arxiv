    "previous arpes studies on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath7 ( bi2212 ) clarified several characteristic features essential to the anomalous superconductivity , such as a large fermi surface ( fs ) centered at ( @xmath8 , @xmath8 ) point in the brillouin zone ( bz),@xcite the @xmath6-wave superconducting ( sc ) gap,@xcite the emergence of well - defined bogoliubov quasiparticles below @xmath4 in the antinodal region,@xcite and the pseudogap above @xmath4 in the underdoped regime.@xcite recent remarkable progress in energy and momentum resolutions of arpes further enables us to directly observe the bilayer splitting due to interaction of two cuo@xmath0 planes@xcite and the strong mass renormalization of band ( kink in the energy dispersion ) in the vicinity of the fermi level ( @xmath9 ) indicative of an electron - boson coupling.@xcite however , it is still unclear whether or not these characteristic low - energy excitations are generic feature for all htscs .",
    "hence the universality of essential character of cuo@xmath0 plane should be carefully checked by performing arpes with other families of htscs . in this",
    "regard , yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( y123 ) is the most suitable candidate since it is also a bilayered system with a similar maximum @xmath4 , and the bosonic ( phononic and magnetic ) excitations , which are related to the low - energy dispersion ( @xmath10-@xmath11 relation ) , are intensively studied by inelastic neutron scattering experiments.@xcite    it is known from previous arpes on y - based htscs @xcite that ( i ) the sc gap is not as robust as that of bi2212 and is hardly observed even below @xmath4,@xcite and ( ii ) strong surface states in the antinodal region dominate the low - energy excitations,@xcite causing a difficulty in distinguishing genuine feature of the bulk cuo@xmath0 plane .",

    "@xcite reported the first evidence for the existence of kink in the dispersion along the nodal direction .",
    "although the experimental results from these two groups certainly provided a way to better understanding the anomalous electronic states of y123 , they also gave rise to serious contradictions / uncertainties in the assignment of band characters .",
    "if both interpretations are correct , it follows that ( i ) the bilayer splitting observed along the nodal direction @xcite is absent in the antinodal region,@xcite and ( ii ) the surface state observed around x / y points has nothing to do with the nodal dispersion.@xcite furthermore , there still remain several unresolved issues as to ( i ) the microscopic origin of the surface band , ( ii ) the @xmath11-dependence of the sc gap , and ( iii ) the origin of the electron - boson interaction responsible for the superconductivity .    in this article , we report high - resolution arpes study on y123 in order to address the above - mentioned issues . by carefully tuning photon energy to separate contribution from the different bands , we have successfully mapped out the two - dimensional band dispersion and fs .",
    "the results reveal existence of five different bands in the vicinity of @xmath9 , which were not well identified in previous studies .",
    "they are the cuo - chain band , the bonding and antibonding bands of heavily - overdoped crystal surface , and their bulk counterparts .",
    "we also found that the bulk electronic states of cuo@xmath0 plane certainly show a signature of strong electron - boson coupling , the @xmath6-wave sc gap , and relatively broad sc peak indicative of the existence of electronic inhomogeneity , showing a remarkable similarity with those of bi2212 .",

    "along cut @xmath22 which corresponds to nearly ys direction , we observe highly - dispersive and weakly - dispersive bands having the bottom at 130 mev and 10 mev , respectively .",

    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "the energy position of two bands does not show a discernible change as a function of @xmath26 , while the change in @xmath26 value causes substantial difference in the intensity ratio of two bands .",

    "the oscillating behavior is understood by considering the existence / absence of available final states during the photoexcitation process .",
    "it is also noted that each band shows the local maximum / minimum of spectral weight at different photon energies .",
    "this trend , possibly caused by the difference in the symmetry of wave functions for two bands @xcite , is quite similar to the @xmath26-dependent matrix - element effect of the bonding and antibonding bands in bi2212,@xcite demonstrating that the outer and inner bands are actually assigned as the bonding and antibonding bands , respectively .",

    "@xcite would be also influenced by this matrix - element effect .",
    "this effect should be seriously taken into account when we discuss the @xmath27 dispersion and the absolute intensity of bands in y123 , as in the case of bi - based htscs.@xcite    to check whether or not these bands show any signature of sc - gap opening , we plot in fig .",

    "1(c ) ) is x = 0.29@xmath280.02 , which corresponds to the doping level at the boundary between the sc and metallic phases.@xcite by also taking into account the facts that bulk superconducting properties are quite similar between y123 and bi2212,@xcite and arpes is relatively surface - sensitive experimental technique , it is plausible that the cleaved top - most cuo@xmath0 bilayer is overdoped",

    "another interesting feature in fig .",
    "5(a ) is that a dip or a spectral break emerges at higher energy than the sc peak , as indicated by the gray open circles . this dip / break originates in a nearly optimally - doped bulk component , since it is related to the bulk sc peak .",
    "the existence of the spectral dip / break suggests that a strong electron - boson coupling exists in bulk y123 around the optimally - doped region .",

    "may be explained by the difference in the size of the sc gap .",
    "it is necessary to determine the momentum- and temperature - dependence of the dispersion kink in detail to elucidate the origin of the electron - boson coupling .    to elucidate the @xmath11-dependence of the sc gap",

    "6(b ) , the metallic nature of the surface state is remarkably suppressed .",
    "although there is a small but finite surface contribution around @xmath9 , this does not seriously affect the determination of the size of bulk sc gap , since the bulk sc peak is well identified in wide area of bz .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that energy position of the bulk sc peak is strongly @xmath11-dependent and gradually becomes small on approaching the nodal direction , indicating the @xmath6-like order parameter . in order to estimate the sc gap size ( @xmath35 ) , we have symmetrized the spectra with respect to @xmath9 ( ref .",

    "a good agreement is obtained with the parameter @xmath37 = 34 mev .",
    "this value is similar to the sc peak position in the tunneling measurement.@xcite on the other hand , this value is smaller than that estimated by lu @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "( 44 mev ) @xcite because they measured the sc gap at y point but not at the @xmath20 point .",
    "it is noted here that observed energy width of the sc quasiparticle peak ( @xmath3820 mev ) is not resolution limited ( energy resolution : 12 mev ) .",
    "a similar behavior has been reported in bi2212 @xcite and explained in terms of the existence of spatially inhomogeneous electronic states as observed by stm / sts experiments on bi2212.@xcite when the sc - gap size shows spatial variation , the spectral peak is expected to be broadened , since arpes probes photoelectrons emitted from a large area of the sample surface ( @xmath38100 @xmath39 m ) .",
    "this implies that , even in y123 which is reported to be homogeneous on the scale of coherence length ( @xmath38100 nm)@xcite , the inhomogeneity certainly affects the electronic states on the wider scale ( @xmath38100 @xmath39 m ) .",

    ", the superconductivity may disappear at the cuo@xmath0 sheets just below bao layer due to the absence of the cuo chain , while the superconductivity may be maintained at the sheets below the cuo chain . in either case",
