    "graphene , a two dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms composed of two identical interpenetrating triangular sub - lattices , has attracted research interest because of its novel linear dispersion relation resulting in unique electronic properties such as room temperature intrinsic carrier mobility@xcite . exploiting such superior electronic properties combined with recently developed",
    "large scale growth of graphene by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd)@xcite , has led to field effect devices integrated on a wafer scale showing promise for future electronic applications@xcite . however , field effect performance of exfoliated graphene is adversely affected by carrier scattering by charged impurities in the surrounding media@xcite , surface phonons@xcite on gate dielectric , and graphene acoustic phonon@xcite .",
    "although graphene grown by cvd shows outstanding uniformity and mobility on a wafer scale , field effect transport measurement performed after the transfer process , may be strongly affected by undesirable impurity scattering@xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding transport on cvd - grown graphene influenced by impurity scattering is an important issue for funamental physics and for further improvement of device performance .    in this work",
    "we are presenting an experimental study of monolayer graphene transport properties , with the emphasis on understanding the temperature dependent resistivity , complemented by a detailed comparison with theoretical calculations of graphene resistivity limited by charged impurity and phonon scattering .",
    "such a combined experimental and theoretical study has not been undertaken for cvd graphene .",
    "our work is closest in spirit to the early work by tan _",
    "et al._@xcite in exfoliated graphene where , however , only the low - temperature density - dependent transport properties of graphene were studied in a combined experimental - theoretical investigation to establish the dominant role of charged impurity scattering in determining the low - temperature graphene electrical conductivity . early work on graphene transport properties @xcite emphasized the weak temperature dependence of graphene resistivity upto the room temperature , presumably because of the weakness of the basic electron - phonon coupling in graphene .",
    "such a weak temperature dependent conductivity is unheard of in electronic materials where phonons invariably dominate the room - temperature resistivity . in graphene ,",
    "the very weak phonon effects on the electrical conductivity have only recently been experimentally observed @xcite verifying earlier theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "although there have been several earlier experimental works on the temperature dependence of transport properties in _ exfoliated _ graphene , our current work is the only work in the literature , to the best of our knowledge , which reports on the measured temperature dependence of graphene resistivity in _ cvd",
    "_ graphene .",
    "our work is also the only one in the literature combining experiment with detailed theory to shed light on the physical processes controlling the temperature dependence of graphene resistivity .",
    "one of our most important findings is that the low carrier density ( and low temperature ) temperature - dependence in graphene is dominated to a large extent by carrier activation across the potential fluctuations created by random charged impurities in the environment ( which also lead to the inhomogeneous electron - hole puddle formation responsible for the graphene minimum conductivity phenomenon ) .",
    "we compare our experimental results with a recent theory @xcite on the puddle induced temperature dependence in graphene transport properties . obtaining excellent agreement .",
    "such a comparison between theory and experiment for graphene transport at low temperature ( and densities ) where puddles dominate transport properties is completely new in the literature .",
    "one other important indirect consequence of our work is the conclusion that graphene resistivity seems to manifest similar qualitative temperature and density dependence for _ similar mobility samples _ independent of how it is made , i.e. our cvd - grown samples exhibit a temperature dependent resistivity qualitatively similar to exfoliation graphene samples of similar mobility .",
    "this establishes beyond any doubt that the factor determining graphene transport properties ( both density and temperature dependence ) is the effective `` zero - temperature '' ( i.e. very low - temperature ) mobility which itself is determined by the charged impurity distribution in the environment .",
    "thus , improving graphene mobility for electronic applications depends entirely on making graphene purer by removing the impurity content from the environment .",
    "having cvd graphene helps only if it has low impurity content , which , according to our work , is no longer the case when cvd graphene is transferred .",
    "we investigate temperature ( @xmath0 ) dependent resistivity , @xmath1 , of graphene grown by cvd at various carrier densities ( @xmath2 ) . in low mobility samples , a strong insulating behavior at low temperature and a metallic behavior at high temperature",
    "is observed , resulting in non - monotonicity .",
    "( we define `` insulating''/``metallic '' as @xmath3 being negative / positive in the sample ",
    "this is purely an operational definition which is used extensively in the literature : all our samples are metallic in reality since a mobility can be defined . )",
    "this feature persists up to relatively high carrier density . on the other hand ,",
    "high mobility samples show overall metallic behavior from fairly low to high carrier density . to understand this peculiar transport property of cvd graphene , we introduce the concept of thermal activation of charge carriers in electron - hole puddles generated by charged impurity@xcite which strongly affects the graphene mobility .",
    "anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath2 dependence of transport is well described theoretically by the competition among thermal activation , screened impurity scattering , and phonon scattering .",
    "thus , puddles play a very important role in controlling the temperature dependent cvd graphene transport .",
    "we compare our data with a recently developed detailed theory @xcite .",
    "temperature dependence of carrier transport properties , e.g. resistivity , in electronic materials is often attributed to be arising from carrier - phonon interaction since phonons are thermally excited quantized - vibrations of the underlying lattice @xcite .",
    "for example , the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity in normal metals like al or cu is essentially entirely controlled by the electron - phonon interaction strength in the metal .",
    "such ` metallic ' temperature dependence always involves an increasing resistivity with increasing temperature , i.e. @xmath4 , and often , the definition of a metal is taken to be synonymous with the @xmath5 behavior ( or very weak temperature dependence of resistivity ) with a finite ( and presumably , not too large ) zero - temperature extrapolated resistivity .",
    "an insulator , on the other hand , has infinite ( zero ) resistivity ( conductivity ) at @xmath6 , and increasing @xmath0 typically increases its conductivity since activated or variable - range hopping transport become allowed at finite temperature .",
    "an insulator or a localized system thus has @xmath7 with an extrapolated zero - temperature resistivity which is infinite ( or very large ) .",
    "thus , @xmath8 is often taken to be an operational definition of an insulator .",
    "this operational definition of an effective metal ( @xmath5 ) versus an effective insulator ( @xmath7 ) is general and powerful , and has long guided experimental and theoretical research in electronic materials ( metals , semiconductors , doped materials ) .",
    "however , we emphasize that metallic and insulating used in our paper are terminologies for the temperature dependence of resistivity .",
    "( @xmath3 being negative / positive does not necessarily indicate a @xmath6 true insulator / metal . )",
    "given the above very general consideration , it is therefore always very interesting and intriguing when an otherwise well - defined metallic system exhibits insulating ( i.e. @xmath7 ) temperature dependence .",
    "it turns out that graphene is indeed such a rather unusual electronic material which often manifests @xmath7 in some carrier density and temperature range while exhibiting the expected metallic behavior @xmath9 in other regimes of density and temperature@xcite .",
    "in fact , for some samples ( and at some specific values of carrier density ) even non - monotonic temperature dependence with resistivity decreasing with @xmath0 first and then increasing with @xmath0 is observed . in the current paper , we present a detailed experimental study of the temperature dependence of graphene transport properties comparing it with a quantitative theoretical analysis to show how and why such interesting temperature dependence could arise .",
    "the non - monotonicity in the graphene resistivity indicates competing physical processes , and indeed , there are several independent contributions to graphene transport which all depend non - trivially on density and temperature .",
    "these physical processes combine to give rise to the observed temperature dependence as we show in the current work .",
    "we emphasize that although some aspects of this temperature dependence were earlier studied experimentally in the literature for exfoliated graphene on substrates and for suspended graphene @xcite , ours is the first such temperature - dependent transport study for graphene grown by the cvd technique .",
    "ours is also the first experimental study where the measurements are carefully compared with a detailed theoty .",
    "the competing physical mechanisms contributing to the temperature dependent graphene transport are phonons ( which are known to be weak in graphene ) , screening , fermi surface effects , and carrier activation across potential fluctuations associated with the density inhomogeneities or puddles in graphene which dominate its low - density properties . of these four mechanisms , the first two ( phonons and screening ) always produce ` metallic ' behavior whereas the last two ( fermi surface and activation ) always produce insulating behavior . in general , both insulating effects ( i.e. fermi surface effects and activation across puddles ) are stronger at low carrier densities whereas the two metallic mechanisms are stronger at higher carrier densities .",
    "thus , we expect graphene to preferentially exhibit metallic ( insulating ) behavior at higher ( lower ) carrier densities . of course ,",
    "at high enough temperature , phonons will eventually dominate , and all graphene samples should eventually exhibit metallic transport properties ( i.e. @xmath9 ) , and therefore , at some densities we expect to see non - monotonicity in the graphene resistivity as a function of temperature .",
    "all these expectations are beautifully manifested in our experiments and we find reasonable quantitative agreement with theory .",
    "it is interesting and nontrivial , but eventually quantitatively understandable , that graphene shows a complex interplay of effective insulating and metallic behaviors superposed on each other as a function of density with the insulating ( metallic ) behavior dominating low ( high ) densities without any real localization or gapped insulator physics being present in the system .",
    "ours is the first complete study of this phenomenon in cvd graphene with direct comparison between experiment and theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the sample preparation and experimental results for resistivity . in sec .",
    "iii we provide the theoretical analysis of measured non - monotonic resistivity .",
    "we conclude in sec .",

    "physically separates tape / pmma / graphene / metal layer due to poor adhesion of metal film and sio@xmath12 .",
    "after etching of underlying ni / cu by soaking in fecl@xmath13 and cleaning in water , tape / pmma / graphene layer was pressed onto the sio@xmath12(300nm)/si substrate with pre - patterned electrodes ( cr / au of 10/50 nm ) .",
    "the successive removal of tape and pmma in methanol and acetone , respectively , leaves only graphene layer over pre - patterned marks .",

    "the t - dependent resistivity is recorded using 4-probe measurement technique for @xmath15 under @xmath1610 - 5 torr after 24 hour annealing at 150 @xmath17c .",
    "this annealing process before measurement gets rid of hole - doping , and moves the dirac point to near zero gate voltage ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "single layer graphene was confirmed by raman spectroscopy@xcite with single lorentzian fit of 2d peak at 2700 @xmath19 in fig .",

    "the measured hole mobility in a specific graphene sample in the same 6-inch wafer has a large variation by an order of magnitude .",
    "we speculate this large variation is coming from non - uniform transfer procedure which introduces local charge impurities differently .",
    "two groups of devices with mobility of @xmath26 @xmath27/vs ( a ) and @xmath28 @xmath27/vs ( b ) respectively were selected to understand the relationship between @xmath1 at various @xmath2 and the level of disorder ( `` high '' in a , `` low '' in b)@xcite .",
    "1(c ) and ( d ) show @xmath18-dependent resistivity [ @xmath29 of a and b devices , respectively .",
    "no marked difference is observed in raman spectroscopy of these two disparate groups despite the order of magnitude variation in the mobility supporting introduction of non - uniform charge impurities during transfer .",

    "the characteristic observed feature of carrier transport in our low mobility sample a ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) is a strong insulating behavior ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) at low temperatures ( @xmath35 ) for all densities ( up to @xmath36 ) . for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) a non - monotonicity in temperature dependent resistivity develops ( i.e. as t increases , @xmath39 initially decreases and then increases forming a local minimum ) . the observed insulating behavior and non - monotonicity at high density in low mobility samples is not observed in high mobility samples b ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) , where the measured resistivity shows a metallic temperature dependence at higher densities even though the experimental conductivity manifests an insulating behavior at very low carrier density ( up to @xmath40 ) . interestingly , negative @xmath41 at dirac point is @xmath42 for both samples independent of sample mobility , which also has been reported in high mobility suspended graphene@xcite .",
    "recently , ballistic transport was invoked in order to explain the strong t - dependent @xmath1 at dirac point as well as low @xmath2 regime@xcite .",
    "however , this approach is not applicable in our low mobility devices which are obviously in the diffusive regime .",
    "the temperature dependence in our diffusive samples is presumably connected with extrinsic effects such as charged impurity scattering , which is considered the dominant scattering process for transport at low @xmath2 .",
    "note that only metallic behavior has been seen in graphene samples at high densities .",
    "another important aspect of temperature dependent resistivity is that the initial insulating behavior at dirac point is strongly affected by carrier density modulation .",
    "starting from the charge neutrality point , the insulating behavior becomes non - monotonic near @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) for sample a due to the coexistence of low t insulating and high t metallic behavior ( fig .",

    "we note that a strong insulating behavior can be obsered at low mobility exfoliated graphene . most important factor in observing an insulating temperature dependent transport is the strength of potential fluctuations which are proportional to the charged impurity density or inversely proportional to the mobility .",

    "our results imply that carrier transport in cvd graphene devices , which are vulnerable to the impurities or charged defects during the transfer process , is strongly affected by underlying environments , which gives rise to lower mobility in cvd graphene than the exfoliated graphene since both cvd and exfoliated graphene use the same substrate . to get higher mobility cvd graphene a careful transfer process",
    "is required in order to keep the background impurity density low .",
    "we have shown , through experimental measurements and detailed comparison with theoretical calculations , that the temperature dependence of graphene resistivity can be understood as arising from a complex interplay among the physical mechanisms of phonon scattering , screening , fermi surface averaging , and activation across potential barriers in inhomogeneous puddles .",
