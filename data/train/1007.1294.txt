    "entanglement , one of the important features of quantum systems which does not exist classically , has been known as a key resource for some quantum computation and information processes .",

    ", one needs to make use of an entanglement measure in order to specify the entanglement amount of a system .",
    "unfortunately , most of the measures having been proposed for quantification of entanglement can not be computed in general , and because of this , many lower and upper bounds , which can be computed easily , have been introduced for these entanglement measures . using these bounds , one can estimate the amount of entanglement .    in ref .",

    "_ have provided a factorization law for concurrence which is one of the remarkable entanglement measures .",
    "they have shown that the concurrence of a two - qubit state , when one of its qubits goes through an arbitrary quantum channel , is equal to the product of its initial concurrence and concurrence of the maximally entangled state undergoing the effect of the same quantum channel .",

    "@xcite have shown that the generalization of the above factorization law to arbitrary dimensional bipartite states only leads to an upper bound for the concurrence of the system .",
    "if , beside this upper bound we have a lower bound obeying a similar factorization law , then we can make better use of this useful dynamical property .",
    "so it will be valuable to seek for such entanglement lower bounds .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce the concurrence and some of its lower bounds .",

    "a possible decomposition of @xmath10 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) are two different members of an orthonormal basis of the a ( b ) subsystem ( instead of the index @xmath16 in reference  @xcite , we use the indexes @xmath17 because it seams most convenient for the future usage ) .    for mixed states ,",

    "any numerical effort for finding the optimal decomposition , is equivalent to find an upper bound for @xmath21 .",
