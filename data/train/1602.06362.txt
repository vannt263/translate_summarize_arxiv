    "the circuit model of quantum computation , which is the oldest and the most well studied model of quantum computation , is very similar to the classical model of computation , its basic features are that quantum circuits are drawn as horizontal lines representing flow of qubits on which , instead of classical gates unitary quantum operators are acting . in the same way that the elementary classical gates like and , or and not can be joined in various ways to implement any boolean function on @xmath0 bits , in quantum circuits , a universal set of one and two - qubit unitary gates can be joined in a suitable way to produce any unitary gate to any desired level of accuracy .",
    "this similarity is seen in any diagram of quantum circuits , like the one shown in figure ( [ fig : cqcircuit ] ) .",
    "however , the similarity stops here and indeed there is a world of difference between the two models .",
    "+        in figure [ fig : cqcircuit ] ( a ) , horizontal lines actually depict wires , and the whole diagram is a static template which shows how different gates which are well localized and  fixed - in - space `` , act on the logical values of the input bits , once they are fed into the circuit . on the other hand , in figure [ fig : cqcircuit ] ( b )",
    "there is no wire at all and horizontal lines and the gates just display when and on which qubit a unitary gate should be applied ' ' in time `` .",
    "the quantum circuit is not a static hardware template , but is more or less the same as the quantum algorithm itself and a great deal of external control should be applied in time in order to run this circuit or algorithm . in a classical circuit ,",
    "bits of information ( small electrical currents or bunches of electrons ) move down the lines and are acted on automatically by the classical gates on their way , while in a quantum circuit , qubits of information ( electrons , photons , spins , etc ) stay in their place , while an external controller , applies different quantum gates on them in a particular order described by the quantum circuit .",
    "+ of course there are schemes of quantum computation , e.g. optical realizations , in which ' ' flying `` qubits carry information and are acted on by localized and '' fixed - in - space `` optical elements . however , the drawbacks of such schemes is the weak interactions between photons in non - linear optical realizations , or the probabilistic nature of gate teleportation in linear optical quantum computing @xcite .",
    "one has also to design mechanisms for converting `` flying '' qubits into `` stationary '' qubits of other types which can interact strongly @xcite and transfer information over small distances .",
    "there are other schemes which are much easier to control and manipulate , like nmr @xcite , but are generally known not be scalable . +",
    "intensive study of spin chains as quantum wires in the past decade @xcite has revealed an interesting synthesis between these two demands .",
    "the very appealing property of this solution is that it allows one to directly communicate the information , without converting it to another form .",
    "of particular interest are those schemes where information can be routed either passively , with no control on the overall system , or control only over a small portion of the system @xcite , or only global external control over the entire system without any individual addressing @xcite .",
    "+ therefore , it is quite tempting , both theoretically and practically to design schemes where wires can be arrays of heisenberg spin chains , and qubits can be excitations which flow down these chains @xcite .",
    "these chains can be joined to each other and in certain interaction zones , their interaction can be such that when excitations pass through these zones , specific one or two qubit gates act on them , without any external control .",
    "the emphasis is here on the absence of ' ' external control `` which makes these exactly as classical circuits .",
    "+ the most recent attempt in this direction which is the culmination of a long series of investigations @xcite is reported in @xcite . in this scheme",
    "a pair of periodic heisenberg spin chains with xy interactions on each of them play the role of a single quantum wire , where a dual rail encoding is used to encode a single qubit , figure ( [ dual rail ] ) .",
    "single qubit gates are implemented by ' ' rewiring \" parts of these chains , in the sense that new types of interactions are imposed on parts of these chains .",
    "these will be briefly reviewed in the sequel . as is well - known",
    ", universal quantum computation requires in addition to these single qubit gates , the ability to implement also an entangling gate , like the cnot or cphase gate which acts on two qubits @xcite . in @xcite this is solved by imposing a non - local interactions between two chains , figure [ fig : cphase ] ( a ) .",
    "certainly this feature is an important hindrance in experimental realizations of this scheme .",
    "+ this is where our work in this paper is motivated .",
    "we want to replace this non - local interaction by a local one and to this end we borrow ideas from quantum electrodynamics , where the long - range interaction between two charged particles is mediated by a photon which interacts locally by each of the charged particles .",
    "therefore , in places where we require a cphase gate , we add a third chain between the two chains , figure [ fig : cphase ] ( b ) , which mediates the long - range interaction between the two chains by locally interacting with each of them .",
    "note that as shown in @xcite , the size of the interaction zones in each of the chains and between the chains need to be greater than the width of the gaussian packets in order not to having appreciable errors .",
    "for details of error analysis see @xcite .",
    "the final result is that we now have a set of chains with local interaction which acts like a static quantum circuit .",
    "this static quantum circuit is then capable of doing universal quantum computation in the same way that classical circuits can do universal classical computation .",
    "+     or a logical @xmath1 , depending on which of the two xy chains is in the vacuum state @xmath2 and which one carries a gaussian packet @xmath3.,width=529,height=377 ]    the structure of this paper is as follows : in section ( [ background ] ) , we review in some detail the basic elements of the static quantum circuit of @xcite , or as they call it quantum plinko machine . in section ( [ model ] ) , we show how the long - range interactions necessary for the cphase gate can be implemented by using a third chain which acts as a gauge particle or photon and mediates this long range interaction by local interactions .",
    "in fact , we show that a different but still entangling gate can be made in this way . in section ( [ exp ] )",
    "we briefly review the experimental progress in realizing spin chains and their manipulation and control in a few systems , like cold atoms and quantum dots and argue that the ingredients needed for realization of our scheme are at the edge of experimental feasibility within these schemes .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper with a discussion and delegate some of the technical details to the appendices .",
    "for the sake of completeness , in this section we briefly review the work of @xcite .",
    "we do not go into the error analysis carried out in @xcite and explain only the basic notions : xy chains and their wave packets , the encoding of logical qubits into these chains , the single qubit gates and the cphase gate .",
    "first we describe our notations .",
    "we will be dealing with periodic spin chains consisting of @xmath4 spins , labeled from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , where the @xmath4-th site is understood to be the same as site @xmath5 .",

    "the hilbert space of each individual spin is spanned by two states @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "the pauli operators on the logical qubits will be denoted by capital letters , x=|*0*|+|*1*|,y =- i  |*0*|+i  |*1*|,z=|*0*|-|*1*| .",
    "consider a periodic chain of spin 1/2 particles .",
    "states in the hilbert space of a chain are written in the computational basis which have the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the chain entails the well - known xy interaction : @xmath20 where subscript @xmath7 indicates the @xmath7-th site of the chain . + this",
    "hamiltonian commutes with @xmath21 so the eigenstates of the hamiltonian have specific value of @xmath22 .",
    "the subspace with @xmath23 is one dimensional which includes the so called vacuum state ,     @xmath24 is called the single excitation subspace .",
    "this subspace is n dimensional and is spanned by @xmath25 , which is defined as @xmath26 , where 1 is on the @xmath27-th site .",
    "here we are interested in eigenstates of the hamiltonian which are in the single excitation subspace , see appendix a. they are defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an integer between @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "a gaussian wave packet @xmath30 can be defined as @xcite     qubits correspond to @xmath31 spin chains . as we will see , for the implementation of entangling gates , it is better to arrange the chains in two layers , the @xmath5 chains in one layer and the @xmath32 chains in another parallel layer .",

    "the group velocity of these packets is given by @xmath37 by choosing @xmath38 , the packet will propagate with group velocity @xmath39 and with no dispersion , since at @xmath38 the derivative of the group velocity ( dispersion ) is @xmath5 @xcite . the unitary evolution of the system @xmath40 acts as a translation operator on the wave packets which in time @xmath41 will translate their center from @xmath42 to @xmath43 up to a small error @xcite .",
    "+      in @xcite the dual rail encoding is used to represent a qubit .",
    "a pair of xy chains represent the @xmath17 and the @xmath1 states of a single qubit , when they are in the following states , figure ( [ dual rail ] ) : @xmath44 @xmath45 from eq .",
    "( [ g packet ] ) we find that ( ) |*0*=0,()|*1*=|*1 * , hence , the operator @xmath46 acting on the dual rail detects whether the logical qubit is in the @xmath17 or the @xmath1 state .",
    "we will later use this fact in our local implementation of the entangling gate .",
    "+ to represent @xmath47 qubits , @xmath31 chains are used .",
    "the pair of chains corresponding to the @xmath0-th qubit are pointed to by the pair of indices @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and all the chains are of equal length @xmath4 , where the spins on each chain are numbers from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , figure ( [ fig : basic1 ] ) . a pauli operator like @xmath50 which acts on the @xmath7-th spin of the chain @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "thus the hamiltonian for the free system which has no quantum gate in it is given by    @xmath54    therefore , when there is no extra interaction between the spins , any gaussian wave - packet flows down the chain without being acted on by any sort of gate .",
    "this acts as a collection of @xmath47 simple wires of the quantum circuit .",
    "a single qubit gate acts on a single qubit , or a single wire ( a pair of @xmath55 chains ) .",
    "therefore , for simplicity we can drop the extra superscript @xmath0 from the spin chains and the operators ( pointing to the label of the qubit ) and write the free hamiltonian for the two chains in the form    [ hfree ] h^_= _ j=0^n-1 ( ^0_j ^0_j+1+^0_j ^0_j+1 + ^1_j ^1_j+1+^1_j ^1_j+1 ) .",

    "it is now straightforward to see that with adding this extra term , the logical state @xmath65 will gain an extra phase of @xmath64 per unit time , when it passes through the wire , while the logical qubit @xmath66 does nt get any phase .",
    "therefore , the gate @xmath67 is implemented on the qubit",
    ". +     gate .",
    "( b ) implementation of a @xmath68 gate .",
    "a curly line indicates the gaussian wave packet and the boxes shows on which region the gates are acting .",
    "the gaussian wave packet enters the gate with group velocity @xmath69 and the length of the gate is chosen to be much larger than the width of the packet .",
    "the @xmath64 signs depicts the extra interactions for implementations of the gates .",
    ", width=529,height=377 ]    notice that in this scheme , each gate ( both single and two qubit gates ) is implemented in a confined gate block .",
    "this means that only a portion of the chains have the added extra interaction terms , see figure ( [ fig : x&zgate2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , when the packets are localized outside of a gate , up to some approximation , they do not feel the presence of these extra terms and we can safely ignore them .",
    "also when they are well localized inside a gate block , again up to some approximation , we can safely assume that the gate spans the whole chain .",
    "the detailed error analysis in this regard can be found in @xcite , we just mention some of their main results here . it has been shown that if we choose the width of the gaussian packets to be @xmath70 , and we take the length of each gate block to be @xmath71 , then we can obtain error @xmath72 with @xmath73 for any @xmath74 , where @xmath47 is the number of qubits , and @xmath75 is the number of gate blocks .",
    "again we focus on a specific pair of chains pertaining to a single qubit and omit the superscript , the index @xmath0 , pertaining to the label of the qubit . we now add the following xy interaction to the two chains : @xmath76 where the superscripts @xmath5 or @xmath32 denotes the two rails pertaining to a single qubit on which the gate is to act .",
    "the extra interaction term does not commute with the free hamiltonian ( [ hfree ] ) , however in the one - particle sector it does .",
    "the reason is that in the one particle sector , the xy interaction ( @xmath77 ) acts just as a simple hopping term , i.e. @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the order of hopping on the legs and the rungs of the ladder in figure ( [ fig : x&zgate2 ] ) enforced by @xmath80 and @xmath81 is immaterial . since @xmath82 is the single - particle eigenstate of the free hamiltonian ( [ hfree ] ) , one can easily see that the following two states |,:= , are eigenstates of the new hamiltonian : ( h_+h_x )    @xmath83 , in the form @xmath84 when passing through the pairs of chains in a time @xmath41 , will acquire phases @xmath85 .",
    "this means that the extra hamiltonian implements the gate @xmath60 on the single qubit which has this type of interaction box on its way .",
    "finally , for performing a controlled phase operation or cphase gate , first the four chains of the two qubits are arranged in such a way that the two @xmath61 chains of the two qubits , are adjacent to each other , figure [ fig : cphase ] ( a ) , @xcite .",
    "the chains @xmath49 and @xmath86 are adjacent to each other .",
    "actually this arrangement makes half of the @xmath61 chains near each other and the half far from each other .",
    "so a better arrangement will be to put all the @xmath5 chains in one layer and all the @xmath61 chains in another layer above it .",
    "the idea of @xcite for implementing a cphase gate is to impose a long - range interaction between all the spins of the two @xmath32 chains as shown in figure [ fig : cphase ] ( a ) . again omitting the superscripts corresponding to the labels of the qubits and focusing only on the two @xmath32-chains ,",
    "the interaction is of the form @xmath87 this hamiltonian does not commute with the free hamiltonian for the chains ( [ hfree ] ) , but in the one - particle sector it does .",
    "if we order the chains as @xmath88 , then a momentum eigenstate like @xmath89 , where two packets are moving on the chains @xmath32 and @xmath90 has the energy @xmath91 , while the other states where there is only one or no packet in the two middle chains have the same energy as before , without an extra @xmath64 . since the four possible logical qubits correspond to the following four states on the chains [ logical quibit ]     pass through the chains in a time @xmath41 simultaneously they pick up a phase @xmath92 , this interaction implements the two - qubit gate _ cphase _",
    "|*a*,*b*=e^i t |*a*,*b*. now we move on to replace this non - local interaction with a local one and come up with a different entangling gate .",
    "in this section we will introduce a new method for implementing an entangling gate .",
    "this gate together with the one qubit gates of section ( [ xz gates ] ) will then comprise a universal set of quantum gates .",
    "the scheme of @xcite for performing a cphase gate on two qubits , required non - local interactions between the @xmath61rails in which the two qubits were encoded .",
    "therefore , we introduce an ancillary rail between the two desired @xmath61rails , where the ancillary rail has an xy hamiltonian in a constant external transverse magnetic field . the necessity of this magnetic field will be explained later on .",
    "this ancillary rail will locally interact with two @xmath61rails and effectively produce non - local interactions between the two rails ( see figure [ fig : cphase ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the general idea here is similar to that from quantum electrodynamics where the photon generates long - range interactions between charged particles .",
    "this analogy will help us to build the model intuitively . +        to this end",
    "we will add an ancillary spin chain in the middle of the two main chains @xmath93 and @xmath94 and arrange so that it has a doubly degenerate ground state and the energy gap is so large to effectively restrict the dynamics to the degenerate ground space . denoting the two ground states by @xmath95 and @xmath96 and inspired by the basic vertex of quantum electrodynamics",
    ", we expect an effective potential as shown in figure ( [ figphoton ] ) .",
    "working backward from this effective potential we find the hamiltonian of the ancillary chain to be        ) .",
    "the ancillary qubit plays the role of the photon with two states @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the states of the electron are denoted by @xmath66 and @xmath97 .",
    "the vertex in ( a ) translate to @xmath98 and the vertex in ( b ) to @xmath99 , leading to @xmath100 . later in the article and for notational convenience the two states @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath101 respectively . ,",
    "width=529,height=377 ]    @xmath102    where hereafter the superscript anc stands for the ancillary rail .",
    "the role of the external magnetic field is to make the ground state degenerate .",
    "the reason for the overall factor of @xmath103 , will be explained later .",
    "the standard way for solving this hamiltonian is to use the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite .",
    "we will use this transformation in appendix a when we want to find the full spectrum of the model and perform the error analysis in appendix b. for the present discussion where we are only interested in the ground states , we follow a simpler approach and write ( [ hanc ] ) in the following explicit form : @xmath104 where _ j , j+1 = ( 2-_j-_j+1-_j_j+1-_j_j+1)= (    cccc 0 & & & + & 2 & -2 & + & -2 & 2 & + & & & 4    ) _ j , j+1 , which shows that the operator @xmath105 is a positive operator .",
    "it is then readily seen that the following two states are eigenstates with zero energy and hence , due to the positivity of @xmath105 , the degenerate ground states of @xmath106 : [ logical qubits ] |=|0,0,0 , |:=_j=0^n-1|j .",
    "the argument for @xmath2 is simple , because @xmath105 has the product state @xmath107 as a ground state .",
    "the argument for @xmath101 is based on the observation that @xmath108 acts as a hopping operator , under which @xmath109 and @xmath110 and @xmath111 are annihilated .",
    "the operator @xmath112 also acts as a number operator which gives a total energy equal to zero for @xmath101 .",
    "+ we will later show that the parameter @xmath113 can be chosen so that there is a sufficiently large gap between the ground space of the ancilla and its excited states . in this ground space",
    "we can define the following pauli operators which act on the two ground states and will be needed in our calculations in the sequel :    [ logical gates ] & & ^:=||+|| , & & ^:=-i  ||+i  || , & & ^:=||- || .",
    "we are now ready to introduce the interaction between the ancillary rail and the @xmath61rails , which lead to the effective implementation of cphase gate .",
    "since we are concentrating on two specific rails , we use a simpler notation for the pauli matrices and omit the superscripts .",
    "first consider a block of the ancillary rail and one of the @xmath61rails , say the left one , figure [ fig : cphase ] ( b ) .",
    "we denote this a @xmath114 block for reasons to be clear soon .",

    ", we will show that if we take @xmath118 , then restricting the dynamics to the ancillary ground space causes an error which is less than @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , we need the effective interaction induced in this subspace which is given by @xmath120 , where [ project ] p_0:=||+|| , is the projection operator on the ground space of the ancillary rail . in view of the form of @xmath121 and ( [ project ] ) we have to calculate the following :    p_0 _ j p_0=(||+||)_j(||+|| ) .",
    "we now note that , since @xmath122 creates an extra particle on an empty site @xmath7 or remove a particle from this site , then two of the matrix elements vanish , namely @xmath123 .",

    "we remind the reader that the number operator @xmath125 detects the existence of a gaussian packet on rail @xmath32 . in a similar way we can construct another block where the interactions are of the type @xmath128 .",
    "this will then lead to the effective interaction    v^1,_=e ^ ^ [ v ]    from these types of interaction between the ancillary rail and the @xmath61rails , and by adjusting the signs of the coupling @xmath116 , we construct two blocks of interactions between the ancillary rail and the two @xmath61rails adjacent to it and call them respectively simply by @xmath129 and @xmath130 , as in figure ( [ fig : vvv ] ) .",

    "of course it is understood that each of the proposed systems can not solve all the problems at once and only in the course of time , a specific , possibly hybrid proposal may be developed with optimal solutions of all the problems .",
    "below we list possible partial answers to the above questions .",
    "+    * first we note that spin chains with controllable couplings with effective interactions of heisenberg or xy chains have been realized in several systems .",
    "a possible setup is quantum dot arrays @xcite , where the exchange interactions between the trapped electrons in neighboring dots can be modeled as a spin interactions and the couplings can be tuned by controlling the voltage barriers between neighboring dots .",
    "another setup is cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , where it has been shown @xcite that it is possible to induce and control strong interaction between spin states of neighboring atoms by adjusting the intensity , frequency , and polarization of the trapping light .",
    "more specifically it is shown @xcite that `` for sufficiently strong periodic potential and low temperatures , the atoms will be confined to the lowest bloch band @xcite '' and `` their effective hamiltonian is given by an the well - known heisenberg model ( xxz model ) '' .",
    "moreover it is argued in @xcite , that homogeneous magnetic fields and also ising interactions which are required in our implementation of cphase gates , `` can be easily turned on and off by adjusting the potential @xmath152 '' or the intensity of laser light .",
    "it is important to note that what is required in our scheme is to apply these uniform interactions and magnetic fields over a long array of spins and not on individual atoms or a small number of them .",
    "+ another scheme is the coupled wave - guide arrays where by suitably choosing the distance between waveguides , effective interactions of the hamiltonian has been tuned . in these systems ,",
    "experimental perfect state transfer has been reported , in arrays of length 11 @xcite and 19 @xcite .",
    "other less controllable systems are small nmr systems @xcite and nv - centers in diamond @xcite . + * we next face the problem of initializing the chains to the desired states . for gapful spin chains , generally cooling the system down to below the energy gap",
    "is the standard tool for this purpose , however for gapless spin chains , which is the more ubiquitous case for spin 1/2 systems , one can use adiabatic evolution to put the system in the ground state @xcite . to prepare a logical qubit in a dual rail , as needed in our scheme",
    ", we should prepare a chain to be in a gaussian wave - packet which should be almost dispersion free .",
    "the conditions for such a preparation have been explored in detail in a theoretical paper @xcite .",
    "since such a gaussian packet is nothing but a twisted w - state @xcite , which is a linear superposition of states in which only one spin is excited , they should resemble spin waves and hence , should be close to eigenstates of the chain hamiltonian . + nevertheless , at present we do not know of any concrete experimental proposal for preparing such gaussian wave packets in the single - particle sector of spin chains .",
    "one recent development which may be relevant in this connection has recently been reported in @xcite , where a chain of n=21 waveguides , whose couplings can be modeled by an @xmath55 hamiltonian , have been used to perform discrete fourier transform ( dft ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that an input signal of gaussian form , prepared `` by focusing a beam from a hene laser '' , can be converted into a gaussian profile along the chain .",
    "according to @xcite , the applications of their scheme , reaches among other areas , `` qubit storage and realization of perfect discrete lenses for non - uniform input distributions '' , which in turn `` opens the way to many interesting applications in integrated quantum computation '' .",
    "+ * finally , we come to the question whether or not these spin chains can be scaled up to large sizes .",
    "this is in fact , the basic property of every viable candidate for quantum information processing .",
    "generally every protocol , whether it be ion trap or optical lattice faces this problem . as explained in the answer to the first question , effective interactions between electrons in arrays of quantum dots can be modeled by spin hamiltonians and the couplings can be controlled by adjusting the potential barriers between the dots .",
    "recent years have seen groundbreaking results in fabricating si , si / sige and dopant - based quantum dots @xcite .",
    "critical advances like isolation of single electrons , the observation of spin blockade , single - shot read - out of individual electron spins , novel ways of on - chip multiplexing @xcite , make them promising candidates for realization of quantum spin systems with long spin coherence times , and single site addressability necessary for quantum computation and spintronics , in particular for a protocol like the one discussed in the present paper .",
    "the trend of performing quantum computation on chains of spins , either in the form of quantum turing machines @xcite , or quantum ballistic models @xcite or billiard balls @xcite goes back to the 80 s , well before the rapid upsurge of interest in quantum computation initiated by shor s factoring algorithm and the demonstration of universal set of quantum gates by barrenco et al @xcite .",
    "it was then with the work of sugato bose in @xcite that heisenberg spin chains were shown to be good carriers of quantum states of spins .",
    "since then , intensive studies have shown that heisenberg chains with simple or engineered xy interactions , can act as perfect or almost perfect carries of quantum states over short distances .",
    "the arbitrary state of a spin joined to the left end of such a chain is carried with high fidelity to the right end through the natural dynamics of this chain , without any external control and without the need to individually address the spins .",
    "it has also been shown that these chains can be initialized to carry a gaussian wave packet of excitations .",
    "dual rails can encode the two states of a logical qubit depending on which of the two rails are empty and which one carries a packet . a @xmath153 array of such dual rails",
    "can then act as quantum wires carrying @xmath0 qubits . on specific areas in these arrays",
    ", local interactions can be implemented between the spins of the chain such that when qubits pass through these interaction zones , specific one and two - qubit quantum gates , necessary for universal quantum computation , act on them , again without any external control @xcite . in this way",
    "static templates or quantum circuit hardware , can be constructed , which when joined to each other can create large scale quantum circuits .",
    "the scheme of @xcite however requires long range interactions between adjacent chains in order to implement the two qubit cphase gate .",
    "inspired by the role of gauge particles ( photons ) in quantum electrodynamics which locally interact with electrons to mediate long range interaction between them , we have shown that by adding extra ancillary chains , one can indeed construct such quantum hardware entirely with local interaction between spin chains . in view of the emerging experimental attempts to realize such schemes for quantum state transfer @xcite",
    ", we hope that our bringing of the scheme of @xcite closer to experimental and practical feasibility will pave the way for making static and time independent quantum circuits in the future and quantum chips in the long run . + * acknowledgements * we would like to thank a. bayat for very helpful comments and discussions and for bringing several useful references to our attention .    9    e. knill , r. laflamme and g. j. milburn , a scheme for efficient quantum computation with linear optics , nature 409 , 46 - 52 ( 2001 ) .",

    "putting aside errors which result from imperfections and inhomogeneity in the couplings , the imperfect shape of wave packets and similar source of errors which may result in practice , we are faced with at least three sources of theoretical errors .",
    "these should be properly bounded in order for a quantum computation scheme to work properly . in this appendix",
    "we briefly discuss these bounds .",
    "+ the first type of error and the easiest ones to be dealt with , results from contamination of single particle states with higher particle ones . if such errors occur , i.e. if a 1-particle sector @xmath171 is contaminated by a 2-particle state @xmath172 in the form @xmath173 where , @xmath174 is in the 2-particle sector or higher , due to conservation of particle number , the error @xmath175 acquires only a time - varying phase and in the course of time , its magnitude does not increase . at the end of the circuit , where only single particle measurements are performed ,",
    "such erroneous states are projected out .",
    "+ the other source of error is related with the degree of localization of the packets .",
    "this is common to our scheme and that of @xcite and we suffice to quote from latter reference that for performing @xmath75 gates on @xmath47 qubits if the size of the chains are chosen to be @xmath73 , then the error of the computation will scale as @xmath72 , for any @xmath74 . therefore , this is not a threat to scalability of the scheme .",
    "+ finally , we come to the third problem which is specific to our way of implementing the cphase gate by local interactions with an ancillary chain , where we require that the couplings in the ancillary rail be strong enough",
    ". we will show in the rest of this appendix that if the xy couplings of the ancillary rails are larger than @xmath176 the error that this would add is @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , in view of the polynomial overhead in the size of chains @xmath4 for bounding all types of errors , the protocol is scalable .",
    "the details of this analysis will follow .",
    "+ in what follows we will show that if we choose the couplings @xmath178 such that @xmath179 , then by substituting the hamiltonian with the effective hamiltonian , @xmath180 , the magnitude of error , per each entangling gate , is @xmath177 .",
    "specifically we will show that , for each entangling gate block , and a wave packet @xmath181 initialized at the beginning of this gate block , we have : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the time interval that takes for the wave packet to translate through this gate block",
    ". we will prove this result by using time - independent perturbation theory .",
    "we split the total hamiltonian into two parts , the base hamiltonian @xmath184 and the perturbation potential @xmath185 , which will be defined in the sequel .",
    "then in theorem [ gap ] we show that if we choose @xmath179 , then there is an energy gap , greater than one , between the ground and the excited states of the ancillary rail .",
    "next in theorem [ higher order ] and [ bound ] we derive some useful bound that along with theorem [ gap ] will be used in corollary [ error ] to derive some bounds on the transition amplitudes between the subspace that is spanned by @xmath186 and @xmath187 , and the other eigenstates of @xmath188 .",
    "specifically , in corollary [ error ] by using perturbation theory , we show that if we have an eigenstate of @xmath188 , where the ancillary rail is in its ground states , then it is approximately equal to its perturbed ket up to an error @xmath177 , and also its energy will be perturbed with a correction of order @xmath189 .",
    "afterwards , by using corollary [ error ] we can show that equation holds for eigenstates of @xmath188 .",
    "given the fact that the wave packet @xmath181 is a linear combination of some eigenstates of @xmath188 , we have to show that the same inequality that holds for these eigenstates is true for the wave packet @xmath181 as well .",
    "hence , in theorem [ conservation ] , we use the translational symmetry of the system to prove an equation for conservation of momentum , and we use it afterwards to prove the main result of this appendix , the equation . also notice that the error analysis in this appendix only is done for the case where the logical state of the two qubits is @xmath190 , i.e. @xmath191 , the error analysis for the other cases can be done similarly .",
    "+ we provide the error analysis for the case of a @xmath129 gate block , the case of a @xmath130 gate block is quite similar .",
    "first , we split the total hamiltonian @xmath192 into two parts , the base hamiltonian @xmath193 , and the perturbation potential @xmath194 : @xmath195 where @xmath196 \\otimes \\hat{x}^\\text{anc},\\ ] ] and @xmath197 \\otimes \\left [ \\x^\\text{anc}_x - \\frac{\\hat{x}^\\text{anc}}{\\sqrt{n } } \\right].\\ ] ] notice that the base hamiltonian @xmath188 here , is in fact , equal to the effective hamiltonian @xmath180 defined in section [ model ] .",
    "now we have to identify the eigenstates of @xmath188 and then obtain the perturbed eigenstates in terms of the perturbation potential @xmath185 .",
    "given the fact that @xmath126 can be diagonalizes as : @xmath198 and the fact that @xmath199 are eigenstates of @xmath106 , if we change the eigenstates @xmath186 and @xmath187 to states @xmath199 , we can diagonalize both @xmath200 and @xmath80 simultaneously .",

    "because of the translational symmetry of the system we have : @xmath310 therefore , we have @xmath311 , and since @xmath299 is unitary we can conclude that @xmath303=0 $ ] . + [ statement2 ] : first note that we have : @xmath312 hence , we have @xmath313 , and therefore : @xmath314 + [ statement3 ] : from [ statement1 ] we have @xmath315=0 $ ] , therefore : @xmath316 and so from [ statement2 ] we have : @xmath317 therefore , since @xmath318 we can conclude that @xmath319 .",
    "now we are ready to compute the error that we get by substituting the hamiltonian by the effective hamiltonian @xmath188 , when performing a controlled phase operation . in our model a controlled phase operation is implemented by a gate block localized somewhere along the chains .",
    "the initial state of the system which in fact , is a superposition of gaussian packets will enter this gate block , evolves with the hamiltonian for the system @xmath320 , and then exit this gate block .",
    "now suppose that the initial state be @xmath181 , then after time @xmath183 when the wave packets exit this gate block the state of the system would be @xmath321 .",
    "therefore , in this process the error that we will obtain by the substitution is just @xmath322 .",
    "hence , we have to show that this number is vanishingly small .",
    "note that here we do not have to be worried about the state of other rails in the system . because their ring hamiltonians commute with the perturbation potential @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , the unitary evolution of the system is separable and they evolve only through their ring hamiltonians .",
    "+ because the initial state of the ancillary rail is @xmath186 , then we can write the overall initial state of the two 1 rails and the ancillary rail as : @xmath323 now take @xmath324 , and its normalized perturbed ket to be @xmath325 such that @xmath326",
