    "however , so far , a completely clear picture about the relationship between structure and synchronizability is lacking .",

    "some previous works have shown that the average network distance @xmath1 is one of the key factors that affect the network synchronizability .",
    "the smaller @xmath2 will lead to better synchronizability @xcite , while other researchers found that the heterogeneity of degree can strongly influence a network s synchronizability , that is , a more homogeneous network will show better synchronizability compared to the heterogeneous one , though the average distance of a homogeneous network is longer @xcite .",
    "in addition , some recent works demonstrate that the disassortative networks synchronize easier than assortative ones @xcite , and the increasing clustering will hinder the global synchronization @xcite .    [ 0.5 ]    the majority of previous works are based on the simulation results allowing tuning only one or a very few topological measures ( see also some recently proposed analytical approaches @xcite ) .",
    "if all the topological properties can simultaneously vary , what will happen ? should a network with better synchronizability have some particular properties ?",
    "besides the simulated and analytical approaches , a potential way to investigate the relation between structural and dynamical properties is to track the optimization process , which will lead to some networks with specific dynamical characters @xcite .",
    "concerning with network synchronizability , one pioneer work @xcite , based on a modified simulated annealing algorithm , suggested that the network having best synchronizability should be extremely homogeneous . in donetti - hurtado - muoz approach @xcite , the rewiring operation is used , thus for different initial configurations , the optimization process will lead to the same optimal result , named _",
    "entangled network_. in this paper , as a complementary work , we would like to see the optimal results of keeping the degree of each node unchanged . with this idea , we take the network synchronizability as the object and change the network structure with the constraint condition that the degree of each node could not be changed , which can be realized by edge - intercrossing operation @xcite . as shown in fig .",

( 2 ) interchange these two edges , that is , connect @xmath6 and @xmath7 as well as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and remove the edges @xmath10 and @xmath11 simultaneously .",

    "the equations of motion for the system are : @xmath12 where @xmath13 governs the dynamics of individual oscillator , * h(x ) * is the output function and @xmath14 is the coupling strength . the @xmath15 laplacian matrix * l * is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the set of @xmath18 s neighbors .",
    "all the eigenvalues of laplacian matrix * l * are positive reals and the smallest eigenvalue @xmath19 is zero for the rows of * l * having zero sum .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath20 .",
    "the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue @xmath21 to the smallest nonzero eigenvalue @xmath22 is widely used to measure the synchronizability of the network @xcite .",
    "if the eigenratio @xmath0 satisfies @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a constant depending on @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then the network is synchronizable .",
    "the eigenratio @xmath0 depends only on the topology of interactions among oscillators .",
    "the impact of having a particular coupling topology on the network s synchronizability is represented by a single quantity @xmath27 : the smaller the eigenratio @xmath0 , the easier it is to synchronize the oscillators , and vice versa .",
    "having reduced the problem of optimizing the network synchronizability to finding the smallest eigenratio @xmath0 of the matrix * l * , we shall seek the network with approximately best synchronizability by using edge - intercrossing operation .",

    "to obtain the approximately minimal @xmath0 , we combine the intercrossing processes with a heuristic algorithm , named memory tabu search ( mts ) .",

    "otherwise , do intercross two randomly selected edges of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 denotes the time step , and is set as zero initially ) , and denote by @xmath41 and @xmath42 the resulting graph and its eigenratio .",

    "the following condition is used to determine if a move is tabu : @xmath57 , which is the percentage improvement or destruction that will be accepted if the new move is accepted .",
    "thus , the new graph @xmath41 at @xmath38 is assumed tabu if the total change in the objective function is higher than a percentage @xmath58 . in this paper , @xmath58 is a random number following uniform distribution between 0.50 and 0.75 and the selection of @xmath58 will not affect the optimal result .",

    "in this paper , four different kinds of extensively studied networks are used for simulation .",
    "these are scale - free networks proposed by barabsi and albert ( ba ) @xcite , small - world networks proposed by watts and strogatz ( ws ) @xcite , random networks proposed by erds and rnyi ( er ) @xcite , and the regular networks .",
    "the former one is heterogenous , while the latter three are homogenous .",
    "the simulation results of all the homogenous networks are almost the same , so , in this article , only the results of ws networks are shown .",
    "fig . 2 reports the eigenratio @xmath0 vs. the iteration steps of a ws network with rewiring probability @xmath28 .",
    "the tendencies of some other topological measures are shown in fig .",
    "3 , these includes the average distance @xmath2 , the clustering coefficient @xmath59 , the assortativity @xmath61 @xcite , and the modularity @xmath60 @xcite . based on pimm s work @xcite ,",
    "@xmath60 is defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of common neighbors of nodes @xmath18 and @xmath64 divided by their total number of neighbors .",
    "one trivial result is that the networks with better synchronizability are of shorter average distance . besides , we observe that the degree correlation coefficient decreases from positive reals to negative ones , that is , the disassortative networks are , in general , easier to synchronize .",
    "and , in the whole process , the average clustering coefficient reduces monotonically .",
    "the lower clustering and disassortative pattern of the optimal network are consistent with some previous results @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the modularity decreases too , which indicates that a network with strong modular structures may be more difficult to synchronize , which is also in accordance with some recent results @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath66 in step zero corresponds to the case of initial network , which is a ws network with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath28.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it has been found that many biological and technological networks contain motifs , that is , some specific subgraphs appearing much more frequently than that observed in random graphs with the same degree sequence @xcite .",
    "loop is one of the simplest but most significant subgraphs , for it accounts for the multiplicity of paths between any two nodes @xcite . here",
    "we will show the change of loop structure in the optimization process . due to the limitation of computational ability",
    ", we only calculate the number of loops from size 3 to 5 . from fig . 4",
    ", one can observe that the number of loops drops drastically during the optimization process , which indicates that the dense loops may hinder the global synchronization .",
    "as shown in fig . 5 , in ws networks ,",
    "the number of loops will increase linearly as the increasing of network size , however , the number of loops in the optimal networks is stable and much smaller than that in the initial networks .",
    "all these results indeed state that the optimal networks belong to a class of networks in which there are few number of loops , which may be different from the majority of real biological and technological networks .",
    "this phenomenon may deserve deep explorations in local structures of both artificial and real networks .",
    "[ 0.6]-loops , @xmath67 , vs. @xmath33 in ws networks ( ws , black squares ) and the corresponding optimal networks ( opt , red circles ) , respectively . the network size grows from @xmath68 up to @xmath69 . in all those simulations ,",
    "the rewiring probability and average degree are @xmath28 and @xmath30 .",
    "the three panels from left to right are for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as shown before , this algorithm is highly effective for homogenous networks .",
    "for example , the eigenratio of ws networks can be reduced to about @xmath73 of the original value ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . since the degree distributions of many real networks are heterogenous , next , we will check if this algorithm is also effective for heterogenous networks . as shown in fig",
    ". 6 , this algorithm can also enhance the synchronizability of scale - free networks , however , the enhancement is very small compared with the case of homogenous networks . in the optimization process of ba network ,",
    "the tendencies of average distance , clustering coefficient , modularity and assortativity are almost the same as those for ws network ( not shown ) , but with larger fluctuation and smaller decrement .",
    "different from the case of homogenous networks , as the increasing of network size , the number of loops in both the optimal network and original ba network increases ( see fig .",
    "the number of loops in the optimal network is a little bit smaller than that in the original ba network .    [ 0.7 ] vs. iteration steps of a ba network with @xmath74 and @xmath75 . only the steps in which @xmath0 being reduced are recorded.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.6]-loops , @xmath67 , vs. @xmath33 in ba networks ( ba , black squares ) and the corresponding optimal networks ( opt , red circles ) , respectively .",
    "the network size grows from @xmath76 up to @xmath74 . in all those simulations ,",
    "the average degree is @xmath75 .",
    "the three panels from left to right are for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in summary , a heuristic algorithm , memory tabu search , is used to optimize the network synchronizability by changing the connection pattern between different pairs of nodes while keeping the degree of each node unchanged . for both the homogenous and heterogenous networks ,",
    "the change of some topological measures is recorded during the optimization process , which strongly suggests that a network with shorter average distance , lower clustering , negative degree - degree correlation and weaker modular structure may be easier to synchronize .",
    "in fact , these results has been reported respectively by some previous works .",
    "however , most of those works are based on some specific network models and can only reveal the relation between synchronizability and one or two structural properties , while the present optimization algorithm can simultaneously lay out the whole picture . here , we would like to emphasize that , besides the traditional simulated and analytical approaches , to track the optimization process is a powerful tool of analysis on the relation between structural and dynamic properties of networks .",
    "in addition , we investigated the change of loop structure in the optimization process , and found that the number of loops will decrease as the increasing of synchronizability .",
    "that is to say , the networks with fewer loops will be easier to synchronize .",
    "more interestingly , in the original ws networks , the number of loops will increase linearly as the increasing of network size , while in the optimal networks , this number keeps stable .",
    "this novel phenomenon deserves in - depth exploration . since each node can only impact its neighbors ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , if there is one path , of length @xmath77 , between node @xmath18 and @xmath64 , then , along this path , it takes @xmath77 steps transferring the synchronization signal from @xmath18 to @xmath64 ( or from @xmath64 to @xmath18 ) .",
    "therefore , if there are so many paths of different lengths between node @xmath18 and @xmath64 , the synchronization signal of @xmath18 at a given time will arrive on @xmath64 along different paths at different time , which may disturb each other .",
    "it may be the reason why dense loops will hinder the global synchronization .",
    "an extreme case is that for directed networks , the one with highest synchronizability ( i.e. with eigenratio @xmath0 being equal to 1 ) is a tree structure without any loops @xcite . even if adding one loop of length 2 @xcite , the eigenratio will be doubled @xcite",
    ". however , the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite may be not universal . actually , in synchronization system consisted of non - identical oscillators , a counterexample against ref .",
    "@xcite is reported very recently @xcite .",
    "we believe this work will be helpful for the in - depth understanding about the role of loops in network synchronization .",
    "many previous works focus on synchronization on heterogenous networks , especially scale - free networks .",
    "a common cognition is that the heterogeneity will hinder the global synchronization .",
    "however , since most of those works are based on some specific models , it is not clear whether the homogeneity is a necessary condition for strong synchronizability .",
    "note that , for a fixed degree sequence the present algorithm with edge - intercrossing operation is ergodic , thus the less efficiency of the present algorithm on scale - free networks indicate that the homogeneity should be a necessary condition .",
    "that is to say , within the framework of synchronization of identical oscillators with uniform coupling mode , the heterogenous network is hard to synchronize in despite of its idiographic structure .    the authors thank the guidance of huanwen tang , and wish to recall the memory of prof .",
