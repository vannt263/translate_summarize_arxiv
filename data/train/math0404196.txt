    "in the recent years quantum field theories have provided useful tools for addressing problems in algebraic topology .",
    "an example is the computation of the real cohomology of the spaces @xmath0 of imbeddings of the circle into @xmath1 for @xmath3 .",
    "the works of bar - natan @xcite and kontsevich @xcite , have shown how the perturbative expansion of chern - simons quantum field theory yields the so - called `` vassiliev invariants '' of the space of ordinary knots .",
    "the precise statement is that there exists a complex of ( trivalent ) feynman diagrams whose cohomology classes give rise to 0-cohomology classes of the space @xmath4 .",
    "chern - simons is a topological quantum field theory which can be defined in three dimensions only and produces feynman diagrams whose vertices have valence equal to three .",
    "there exist however other quantum field theories that , while sharing the same topological properties , are defined over manifolds of any dimension and produce feynman diagrams not necessarily trivalent .",
    "these topological quantum field theories are known as `` bf theories '' and their properties are studied in details in @xcite and @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it is shown how the perturbative expansion of bf theories can define a complex of feynman diagrams and a chain map into the de  rham complex of @xmath0 , for any @xmath5 .",
    "moreover this map gives rise to an injective map in cohomology , when restricted to trivalent diagrams .",
    "the cohomology of this complex of feynman diagrams is called `` graph cohomology '' .",
    "a different approach to the problem of computing the cohomology of @xmath0 has been considered by v. vassiliev in @xcite : there exists in fact a spectral sequence converging to the cohomology of @xmath0 for every @xmath2 , whose @xmath6 term coincides with the graph cohomology ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , vassiliev spectral sequence gives an `` upper bound '' to the cohomology of @xmath0 , since nontrivial cohomology classes of @xmath0 must come from some element in @xmath6 , while @xcite gives a `` lower bound '' , since at least those elements corresponding to trivalent diagrams give rise to nontrivial elements in cohomology .",
    "in general it is unclear whether the collapsing always happens at the @xmath6 term , as conjectured by kontsevich @xcite , or there are some `` graph cocycles '' which do not give rise to classes in @xmath7 .    in this note",
    "we want to extend the results of @xcite in the following direction    [ thm - main ] for every even @xmath2 , there exists a nontrivial class in@xmath8 associated to a nontrivalent graph cocycle .",
    "a similar question has been posed by r. bott @xcite regarding the possibility of constructing 1-dimensional cocycles on the space @xmath4 of ordinary knots . in this case , however , it is not even established the convergence of the spectral sequence .",
    "we also mention the work of d. sinha @xcite on the cohomology of the spaces of imbeddings of the real line into @xmath1 . using goodwillie s calculus",
    ", one can define a spectral sequence whose @xmath6-term , as in vassiliev s case , is isomorphic to ( a variant of ) the graph cohomology .",
    "recently p. lambrechts and i. volic have announced a proof of the collapse of sinha spectral sequence at the @xmath6 term . + here",
    "is the plan of the paper .",
    "we will first recall the definition of graph cohomology ( sections  [ sec : grco ] and [ sec : grho ] ) , and the construction of the map from graph cohomology to the de  rham cohomology of @xmath0 ( section  [ sec : csi ] ) . then , in section  [ sec : nontriv ] , we will prove theorem  [ thm - main ] by considering a nontrivial graph cocycle consisting of nontrivalent diagrams and mapping it to @xmath7 .",
    "nontriviality of this class will follow from an explicit evaluation on the dual cycle .",
    "we first briefly recall some definitions given in @xcite . by @xmath9 and @xmath10 we mean the real vector spaces generated by decorated diagrams of order @xmath11 and degree @xmath12 , of odd and even type , respectively .",
    "the diagrams consist of an _ oriented circle _ and many _ edges _ joining vertices which may lie either on the circle ( _ external vertices _ ) or off the circle ( _ internal vertices _ ) .",
    "we require all the vertices to be at least trivalent .",
    "if we denote by @xmath13 the number of edges of a diagram , @xmath14 the number of its internal vertices and @xmath15 the number of its external vertices , then the order @xmath11 of a diagram is @xmath16 ( minus the euler characteristic ) while the degree @xmath12 is @xmath17 ( the deviation from being a trivalent diagram ) .",
    "we also define a _ chord diagram _ to be a decorated diagram whose vertices are all external .    the decoration in @xmath9 is given by numbering the vertices ( up to even cyclic permutations ) , numbering the internal vertices ( up to even permutations ) and orienting the edges ( up to reversal ) . by convention , we number external vertices from 1 to @xmath14 and internal vertices from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . an extra decoration is needed on the edges connecting the same external vertex , namely an ordering of the two half - edges forming them .",
    "the decoration in @xmath10 is given by numbering the external vertices ( up to even cyclic permutations ) and numbering the edges ( up to even permutations ) .",
    "finally , both in @xmath9 and @xmath10 we quotient by the subspace generated by all diagrams containing two edges joining the same pair of vertices and diagrams containing edges whose end - points are the same internal vertex .",
    "the coboundary operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 are linear operators whose action on a diagram @xmath22 is given by the signed sum of all the diagrams obtained from @xmath22 by contracting , one at a time , all the regular edges and arcs of the diagrams . here by arc we mean a piece of the oriented circle between two consecutive vertices , and by regular edge we mean an edge with at least one internal end - point .",
    "the signs are as follows : if we contract an arc or edge connecting the vertex @xmath23 with the vertex @xmath24 , and oriented from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , then the sign is @xmath25 if @xmath26 or @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",
    "if we contract an edge labelled by @xmath29 , then the sign is @xmath30,where @xmath15 is the number of external vertices of the diagram .",
    "these complexes are called _ graph complexes _ , and the relevant cohomology groups @xmath31 and @xmath32 are know as _",
    "graph cohomology_. when we write @xmath33 ( resp .",
    "@xmath34 ) , we mean either the odd or the even - type graph complex ( resp .",
    "graph cohomology ) .",
    "graph homology is given by the dual vector space @xmath35 and the boundary operator @xmath36 defined as the adjoint to @xmath37 .",
    "the homology groups are denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "notice that since there is a preferred basis of @xmath39 given by the diagrams , we can identify @xmath35 with @xmath39 , and consider @xmath40 as an operator on @xmath39 that decollapses the vertices of the diagrams in all possible ways .",
    "for instance , the boundary of a trivalent diagram is always zero , while the boundary of a diagram @xmath22 with all trivalent vertices except a quadrivalent external vertex is the sum of three trivalent diagrams as in figure  [ de-4ev - d ] ( odd case ) and [ de-4ev - p ] ( even case ) .",
    "we claim that all classes of @xmath41 can be represented by chord diagrams only .",
    "more precisely , @xmath42 is isomorphic to the quotient of the space of chord diagrams @xmath43 by the subspace generated by the diagrams of figure  [ 4t - rel - d ] and figure  [ 1t - rel - d ] .",
    "similarly , @xmath44 is isomorphic to the quotient of the space of chord diagrams @xmath45 by the subspace generated by the diagrams of figure  [ 4t - rel - p ] and figure  [ 1t - rel - p ] .",
    "the proof of this fact in the odd case is given in @xcite , thm .",
    "the even case is completely analogous .",
    "the subspaces of figure  [ 4t - rel - d ] and [ 4t - rel - p ] are know as the @xmath46 relations , while the subspaces of figure  [ 1t - rel - d ] and [ 1t - rel - p ] are the @xmath47 relations .",
    "notice that the @xmath46 relations are the boundary of the sum ( with proper sign ) of two of the three nontrivalent diagrams considered in figure  [ de-4ev - d ] and [ de-4ev - p ] .",
    "we now want to recall the definition and main properties of the _ configuration space integrals _ @xcite .    first ,",
    "for any compact smooth manifold @xmath48 , we define the open configuration space @xmath49 of @xmath50 points in @xmath48 to be the space of the @xmath50-uples @xmath51 such that @xmath52 for @xmath53 then , we consider the axerlod  singer  fulton ",
    "macpherson compactification @xmath54 of @xmath49 , given by blowing - up all the diagonals @xcite .",
    "these @xmath54 are smooth compact manifolds with corners .",
    "the space @xmath55 is defined as the submanifold of @xmath56 where the @xmath57st point is fixed to be the point @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath59 is an imbedding of @xmath60 into @xmath1 , then one can force some of the points in the configuration space to lay on @xmath59 , thus obtaining the configuration space @xmath61 of @xmath62 points on @xmath63 and @xmath64 points in @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath65 its compactification . putting all these spaces together",
    ", one gets a fiber bundle @xmath66 , whose fibers are compact .",
    "next , one considers the maps @xmath67 and observes that they extend smoothly to maps @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 be a symmetric top form on @xmath70 which we assume to be concentrated around some fixed direction . here",
    "`` symmetric '' means that @xmath69 satisfies @xmath71 , where @xmath29 is the antipodal map on @xmath70 .",
    "the pull - back via @xmath72 of @xmath69 is a smooth @xmath73-form @xmath74 on @xmath75 called _",
    "tautological form_. forms @xmath76 are defined as the pull - back of @xmath69 via the map @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a component of the compactified configuration space of @xmath62 points on @xmath60 , @xmath79 forgets the @xmath64 points outside the knot , @xmath80 is the projection on the @xmath23th point and @xmath81 is the normalized derivative @xmath82 .",
    "we are now ready to define the maps @xmath83 .",
    "we consider a diagram @xmath84 and number all its edges and vertices ( if they are not already numbered by their decoration ) .",
    "then to the edge between the vertices @xmath23 and @xmath24 we associate the tautological form @xmath74 , and take the wedge product over all the edges of @xmath22 .",
    "finally we integrate ( push - forward ) this product along the map @xmath66 , where @xmath62 is the number of internal vertices of @xmath22 and @xmath64 the number of external vertices . extending this map by linearity",
    "we obtain @xmath85 as shown in @xcite these are cochain maps for every @xmath5 and they induce injective maps in cohomology for @xmath86 .",
    "+ one can wonder whether there exists an analogous construction for the dual theory , namely , whether one can define chain maps @xmath87 or , at least , maps in homology @xmath88    an answer can be given for the case @xmath86 by associating to every trivalent chord diagram @xmath89 a cycle of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath90 , constructed as follows .",
    "consider first an `` imbedding '' @xmath91 of the diagram @xmath22 in @xmath1 , i.e. , an immersion of the oriented circle of @xmath22 into @xmath1 whose only singularities are transversal double points , and such that @xmath92 if and only if @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the end - point of a chord in @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the same indices of the chord in @xmath22 which has been contracted to form the singular point @xmath95 .",
    "next , for every pair of points @xmath96 ( say , @xmath97 ) such that @xmath92 and for every @xmath98 , we consider the following loop in @xmath1 : @xmath99$},\\\\ \\mathbf{z}\\,\\delta\\exp \\left(1/[(t - t_i)^2-\\epsilon^2]\\right ) & \\text{if $ t\\in [ t_i-\\epsilon , t_i+\\epsilon]$ } , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] with @xmath100 . by adding all the loops @xmath101 to the immersion @xmath91 in correspondence with all the double points , we remove ( blow - up ) all the singularities and obtain a family of imbeddings which is parameterized by @xmath11 points on @xmath102 , where @xmath11 is the number of chords of @xmath22 .",
    "we look at this family of imbeddings as a @xmath103-cycle in @xmath0 .",
    "( we remark that the main result of @xcite is that the cycle of imbeddings obtained from the chord diagram @xmath22 is dual to the de  rham cocycle obtained from a trivalent graph cocycle containing @xmath22 , provided this graph cocycle exists ) .",
    "finally we extend these maps @xmath104 by linearity and we have :    [ triv-4 t ] the maps @xmath105 defined above , descend to maps on @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath41 is isomorphic to @xmath106 modulo the @xmath46 and @xmath47 relations , we have to check that the linear combination of the diagrams of figure  [ 4t - rel - d ] , [ 1t - rel - d ] , [ 4t - rel - p ] and [ 1t - rel - p ] are sent to trivial cycles .",
    "consider in fact the four cycles of imbeddings corresponding to the diagrams of a @xmath46 relation .",
    "these cycles ( or better , their images ) are equal everywhere except near a small ball in @xmath1 , where they are described as follows : two strands of the imbedded circle meet in a double point @xmath107 ( which is then blown - up ) and a third strand is blown - up around one of the four ( half ) strands merging in @xmath107 .",
    "denote by @xmath108 the sum of these four cycles .",
    "now , the chain of imbeddings whose boundary is @xmath108 is constructed by considering a chain in @xmath0 equal to the cycles in @xmath108 , except that the third strand is lifted around @xmath107 along an @xmath109-sphere centered in @xmath107 , with 4 holes corresponding to the four ( half ) strands merging in @xmath107 ( see figure  [ ch-4 t ] ) .",
    "notice that the orientation of the @xmath110-chain is automatically fixed by the orientation of the strand we are lifting and the fact that we have fixed , once for all , an orientation for @xmath1 .",
    "as for the @xmath47 relations , one can notice that when we collapse and blow - up a `` short chord ''",
    "( i.e. , a chord whose vertices are consecutive vertices on the oriented circle ) we produce a cycle as in figure  [ ch-1 t ] .",
    "if @xmath111 we have the difference of two ordinary knots which are clearly isotopic , namely there exist a 1-chain of imbeddings whose boundary is precisely the difference of these two knots . in higher dimensions , one can split the `` blow - up '' into two chains , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "suppose in fact that the two strands @xmath114 and @xmath115 meeting at the double point lie on a plane in @xmath1 ; then set @xmath112 to be given by those imbeddings lying on one side of the plane determined by @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and @xmath113 those lying on the other side , in such a way that the cycle of imbeddings which `` blows - up '' the double point is @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , the chains @xmath112 and @xmath113 play the role for @xmath5 of the two ordinary knots , and it is not difficult to see that there exists a higher dimensional analogue to the 1-chain connecting the two ordinary knots , namely that there exists a @xmath117-chain of embeddings whose boundaries are @xmath112 and @xmath118 .",
    "in the quest for nontrivalent graph cocycles , one easily sees that there are no nontrivial elements in @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and that the first example of nontrivial nontrivalent graph cocycle is the generator of @xmath124 .",
    "this cocycle is represented in figure  [ pla ] .",
    "theorem  [ thm - main ] is proved by showing that the image of this graph cocycle through @xmath125 is a nontrivial cohomology class of @xmath0 .",
    "this will follow form the evaluation of this de  rham cocycle on the dual cycle , which we are now going to construct .",
    "let us first consider the linear combination of diagrams of figure  [ alp ] .",
    "we notice that it can be seen as the difference between two chains of diagrams @xmath126 ( the @xmath127 are the chains of diagrams in square brackets ) such that the boundary @xmath40 of each @xmath127 gives one of the @xmath46 relations of figure  [ 4t - rel - p ] .",
    "it is also immediate to check that @xmath126 is indeed a cycle .",
    "next we associate a @xmath128-chain of @xmath0 to @xmath129 and @xmath130 as follows : since @xmath131 is a linear combination of trivalent diagrams , we can apply the map @xmath132 of equation  . as shown in the proof of proposition  [ triv-4 t ] the chain @xmath133 , resp .",
    "@xmath133 , is the boundary of a @xmath128-chain of @xmath0 which we denote by the symbol @xmath133 , resp .",
    "namely , we have : @xmath135 more specifically , what we have to do is to consider an `` imbbeding '' of the first diagram of @xmath129 , resp .",
    "@xmath130 , i.e. , an immersion of the oriented circle of this diagram into @xmath1 which is an imbedding except for a double and a triple point obtained by identifying the end - points of each chord .",
    "we get @xmath133 resp .",
    "@xmath134 , by blowning - up these intersections according to the constructions of section  [ sec : csi ] .",
    "the difference @xmath136 of these two chains of imbeddings is the @xmath128-cycle of @xmath0 that we associate to @xmath137 , and it is represented in figure  [ ch - alp ] . in other words , we have extended the map of equation to @xmath138 .",
    "let us define now @xmath139 so that @xmath140 is the configuration space integral associated to the diagram of figure  [ pla ] .",
    "the theorem is proved by showing that the evaluation of @xmath141 on @xmath142 is different from zero .",
    "recall that the tautological forms @xmath74 are constructed using a symmetric top form @xmath69 on @xmath70 , concentrated around some fixed direction , say @xmath143 .",
    "this means that we are requiring @xmath69 to have support near @xmath144 and near @xmath145 .",
    "moreover we can always suppose that the images in @xmath1 of the chains @xmath133 and @xmath134 lay on a plane perpendicular to @xmath144 , except near the blow - ups .",
    "therefore the only contributions to the evaluation of @xmath146 and @xmath147 on @xmath148 , arise from those parts of the configuration space integral in which the tautological forms `` points toward the direction @xmath144 '' .",
    "this implies in particular that the evaluation of @xmath146 on @xmath148 is zero and that , in the evaluation of @xmath147 on @xmath148 , the only nontrivial contributions arise from that part of the configuration space integral @xmath147 in which @xmath149 is integrated near the blow - up of the double point and @xmath150 is integrated near the blow - up of the triple point .",
    "moreover , it not difficult to see that the evaluation of @xmath147 on @xmath148 can be explicitely computed as twice the degree of the map @xmath151 restricted to a compact subset @xmath152 of @xmath153 .",
    "this subset @xmath152 is given by the cartesian product of two 1-dimensional manifolds , two @xmath117-sphere and a @xmath73-manifold , imbedded in @xmath1 as follows : each of the 1-dimensional manifolds is linked to a @xmath117-sphere , and the @xmath73-manifold wraps around one of the spheres .",
    "for instance if we consider @xmath154 , we can easily see that the point is regular and that the number of elements in the counter - image is one .",
    "in other words , the evaluation of @xmath147 on @xmath148 is different from zero , and this concludes the proof of theorem  [ thm - main ] .",
    "this work arises from a conversation with dylan thurston .",
    "i also thank alberto cattaneo , paolo cotta - ramusino and victor tourtchine for interesting discussions and useful comments ."
