    "the interest in antihydrogen and its interaction with ordinary matter is inspired by the ongoing experiments on antihydrogen synthesis and trapping at cern .",
    "the aim of these experiments is to use cold antihydrogen atoms for tests of the fundamental laws and symmetries of physics .",
    "substantial progress has been made during the recent years in that antihydrogen atoms have been trapped for 1 000 s @xcite .",
    "this time is sufficiently long for the @xmath1 atoms to spontaneously de - excite from the highly excited rydberg states , in which they are formed , to the ground state that is preferred in the planned spectroscopic and ballistic experiments .",
    "the generic example of matter - antimatter interaction is the collision between the two simplest atoms of each sort , the @xmath0@xmath1 collision . in spite of its apparent simplicity the @xmath0@xmath1 system proves to be very challenging .",
    "it significantly differs from e.g. the h ",
    "h system by the presence of annihilation between particles and antiparticles and by the rearrangement : the impinging @xmath1 and h atoms can recombine to two completely different atoms , pn and ps ( see figure [ channels ] ) .",
    "the latter circumstance makes the problem very demanding both formally and computationally , even at the level of coulombic description that is addressed in the present work .",
    "the previous studies of the @xmath0@xmath1 system include distorted - wave approximation @xcite , simple extensions thereof based on the close - coupling method @xcite , the optical - potential method @xcite , and the kohn variational method @xcite .",
    "all previous treatments have been based , one way or another , on the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approach .",
    "the extension to the adiabatic treatment was not possible since it was shown that the adiabatic correction diverges @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the nuclear motion in the bo potential have so far been calculated only for a few of the highest exited states near the @xmath0@xmath1 dissociation threshold @xcite , using numerical integration . in this paper",
    "we use a variational approach using gaussian expansions to investigate the nuclear motion of the proton and antiproton in the improved bo potential .",
    "by using the variational method we obtain a set of all bound states ( eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions ) in the improved leptonic potential that includes the non - divergent part of the adiabatic correction and shows the correct asymptotic threshold behaviour .",
    "previous calculations indicated the presence of possible near - threshold resonance states of the hydrogen - antihydrogen system @xcite .",
    "such states greatly influence the cross sections of both elastic and inelastic hydrogen - antihydrogen scattering @xcite , acting as transient states mediating the rearrangement to protonium and positronium .",
    "we therefore devote special care to the treatment of the near threshold states since it is _ a priori _ possible that the improvement of the bo potential may change the number of states below the threshold and/or their binding energies .",
    "the number of variationally obtained bound states below the threshold is double - checked using the procedure of friedrich and raab @xcite .",
    "the bo - approach to the @xmath0@xmath1 system works very well at the large ( @xmath4 m - nm ) and intermediate ( nm - @xmath5 ) internuclear distances .",
    "however as the atoms come closer , the leptonic clouds start to overlap , and the @xmath0@xmath1 system gets prone to undergo a rearrangement into two completely different atoms , protonium ( pn ) and positronium ( ps ) .",
    "the rearrangement is particularly probable to occur below the so called critical distance ( @xmath6 @xcite ) below which the proton - antiproton dipole is not able to bind the two leptons , and positronium can be released .",
    "the region around the critical distance is particularly difficult to treat .",
    "this is manifested by the divergence of the adiabatic correction to the born - oppenheimer interaction potential @xcite and highlights the need of a full four - body treatment",
    ". the four - body treatment might be e.g. based on the variational method provided that the latter would be able to include the relevant arrangement channels and cope with their coupling .",
    "if the variational method utilizing an expansion in a basis is applied , the basis functions should preferably allow easy transformations between the various arrangement channels , as e.g. in the gaussian expansion method ( gem ) constructed by the kamimura group for the four body problems @xcite .",
    "having these aspects in mind , we expand the improved bo solutions in a gaussian basis , as to allow for the use of these solutions as a subset of the basis in variational 4-body calculations .",
    "we deliver full set of states that are bounded by the bo potential , together with a large number of discretized continuum states ( all expanded in a gaussian basis ) that might be utilized in variational four - body applications .",
    "this might allow for a better understanding of the connection between the adiabatic and the full four body solutions , and provide the missing link in understanding why the adiabatic approach to @xmath0@xmath1 breaks down as manifested by the divergence of the adiabatic correction .",
    "it should be recalled that the bo energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are normally obtained in the bo potential that asymptotically converges to the @xmath0@xmath1 dissociation threshold at @xmath7 a.u .",
    "( a value without adiabatic correction ) and that was the case in all previous calculations .",
    "however in a 4-body calculation the @xmath0@xmath1 dissociation threshold , and all other thresholds , obviously takes their proper value that include the adiabatic correction . in the present work we correct for this defect by including the non - divergent part of the adiabatic correction in our modified leptonic potential through a mass - scaling of the bo potential .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this procedure is _ not _ equivalent to a simple shift of the threshold for the conventional bo potential ( although it incidently assures the correct asymptotic behaviour of the modified leptonic potential ) .",
    "atomic units have been used throughout this article .",
    "the 4-body hamiltonian for hydrogen - antihydrogen system expressed in a space - fixed coordinate system reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are position vectors of proton , antiproton , electron and positron respectively , @xmath13 describes coulomb interactions between all particles , and @xmath14 a.u .",
    "is the proton mass . introducing body - fixed coordinates",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and separating the center - of - mass motion , the 4-body hamiltonian can be rewritten as a sum of a leptonic hamiltonian @xmath18 and hamiltonian @xmath19 , which in this case has the following form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a nuclear reduced mass .    assuming the total 4-body wavefunction as a simple product of a given leptonic function @xmath22 , which is an eigenfunction of ( [ hlep ] ) @xmath23 and some unknown nuclear function @xmath24 , one obtains a nuclear schrdinger equation within the adiabatic approximation @xmath25 where the nuclear hamiltonian is defined as @xmath26 the last term on the r.h.s of ( [ hn ] ) is called the adiabatic correction , and is defined as an expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath19 with respect to the leptonic wave function @xmath27    as it was shown by strasburger @xcite , for the hydrogen ",
    "antihydrogen molecule the adiabatic correction diverges as the internuclear distance tends to the critical value @xmath28 bohr . for this reason",
    "the nuclear hamiltonian ( [ hn ] ) is not well defined and one can not calculate adiabatic energy levels for this system . of course we can apply born - oppenheimer approximation , i.e. solve schrdinger equation with the following nuclear hamiltonian @xmath29 however , one can still improve the born - oppenheimer potential by including only the non - divergent part of the adiabatic correction",
    ". this can be done ( _ vide _ [ scalingapp ] ) through different factorization of the 4-body hamiltonian and can be implemented by a simple scaling of the born - oppenheimer energy .",
    "the last two terms on the r.h.s of ( [ hp ] ) do not depend on the internuclear coordinate @xmath30 , and we can treat them as a part of the kinetic energy of leptons .",
    "this leads to a new leptonic hamiltonian of the following form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electron  proton reduced mass . solving the schrdinger equation with hamiltonian ( [ hlept ] )",
    "one obtains a new leptonic energy curve @xmath33 , which on top of the born - oppenheimer contribution includes also a part of the adiabatic correction .",
    "it can be shown that the new energy is related to the original born - oppenheimer energy by the following mass scaling procedure @xmath34 in can be also shown that the new leptonic potential given by ( [ elept ] ) has the correct adiabatic long range asymptotic behaviour , and nonadiabatic dissociation limit . for the detailed derivation and discussion of this procedure see [ scalingapp ] .",
    "the scaling procedure allows us to define a new nuclear hamiltonian with @xmath35 substituted by @xmath33 @xmath36 which is well defined and can be used to calculate energy levels for the h@xmath37 molecule .",
    "this approach leads to the energies which should be considered as being `` halfway '' between the born - oppenheimer and the full adiabatic approximations .      in this work we used the born - oppenheimer potential for the h@xmath37 system calculated by strasburger @xcite with 256 explicitly correlated gaussian ( ecg ) functions .",
    "the potential was computed for internuclear distances @xmath38 ranging from @xmath39 bohr up to 20.0 bohrs .",
    "for @xmath38 between 12 and 30 bohrs we have appended points computed by strasburger with points obtained from asymptotic formula @xmath40 where @xmath41 hartree is the bo energy of two separated hydrogen atoms and the van der waals constants @xmath42 were calculated by mitroy and ovsiannikov@xcite . + for @xmath43 the born - oppenheimer energy reaches value @xmath44 , where @xmath45 hartree is the positronium ground state energy . when the internuclear distance @xmath38 is smaller than the critical value @xmath46 , the two leptons are no longer bound in the field of a dipole formed by the proton and the antiproton",
    "therefore , for @xmath47 we assumed that the born - oppenheimer energy is equal to the sum of @xmath48 and the coulomb attraction between the nuclei @xmath49 the choice of the potential for @xmath47 is in the spirit of the orthodox bo - approximation , i.e. the potential is equal to the lowest leptonic energy at each @xmath38 , which in this region corresponds to the positronium ground state energy .",

    "the scaling procedure reproduces over 95% of the total adiabatic correction for @xmath38 larger than 2.0 bohrs . for smaller internuclear distances the interaction part of the adiabatic correction becomes larger and the difference grows .",

    "it is shown in @xcite that with a rough approximation the expectation value of the @xmath257 operator with the leptonic wavefunction is proportional to the mean value of the distance between leptons and nuclei .",

    "since the @xmath206 operator does not contain a differentiation over the internuclear distance @xmath38 , the @xmath240 part of the adiabatic correction is not affected by the mechanism described above and is well defined for any @xmath38 .",
